The property only takes a few guests at a time, so the facilities (pool etc) are not going to be crowded, which was a nice change after having just stayed at a hotel in Waikiki.

Our bungalow was great - close to the pool/spa and ocean views. It was big and nicely furnished. The only downside we found was that the bed wasn't so comfortable - a little too soft for our liking, but the pluses of the property made up for that.

We didn't go in the pool, but the spa was excellent. We could sit in the spa and look out over the grounds and the ocean - very relaxing.

The property is a great place to stay as a base to explore the area. You just need to keep in mind that there are no restaurants nearby, so need to plan accordingly. This is a very relaxing place to stay, and we would certainly love to stay here again.","Date of stay: February 2018","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The property is just as pictured. There's a ""big house"" with steps leading down to three small buildings (""villas""), each with their own private patio space and bbq grill. We were in villa 1. We had a small kitchenette area with microwave, mini-fridge and some dishes, a comfy bed, sofa, very small closet, and bathroom with walk-in shower (no tub). Just outside our door was the pool/hot tub area. You need to turn on the hot tub's heater in advance of using it, but it eventually does heat up pretty well. The pool was too cold for us to swim in. (We only had time for pool/hot tub during the early morning or late evening hours, though.) The pool/hot tub are communal, but I didn't see the other guests while there, so it felt pretty private to me. Besides the pool area, there's a gazebo overlooking the ocean. We saw whales breaching and a lovely sunrise. Another part of the property has a lovely garden; there's also beautiful, well-maintained landscaping throughout.  

The Lai Nani is run by a property manager who lives nearby and responds to texts if you have questions or concerns. Our first night, I was cold, and learned to my dismay that our villa had no heat! It has air-conditioning but at night, there's nothing but a blanket to keep you warm. I slept with my winter coat on that night. BUT we discovered the next day that the windows (which are covered with blinds) had been left open. We closed them and also did not turn on the air-conditioning before we left for our day's adventures. When we got back, the room was nice and warm from the sun, and it retained that heat all night. Do keep in mind, though, that Hawaii can get cool at night (just as California beach towns can), so bring a sweatshirt or jacket for comfort. 

The Lai Nani can be difficult to find, especially at night. We learned to look for mile marker 16 on Hwy 19. The property is 17 miles from Hilo, which is where most of the restaurants and grocery stores are. We found Hilo to be crowded with difficulty locating parking at the restaurants we chose; we wished we'd just bought some food and grilled it at the Lai Nani instead. The property is also about a half hour or so from the volcano national park, which we very much enjoyed seeing. No restaurants or shops are within walking distance, as far as I could tell, though there is a zipline place across the street, which we didn't try.

The Lai Nani would be a great place for a family get-together or similar occasion where instead of getting three separate hotel rooms, you get three villas and then have the run of the place. There's even a bar next to the pool. 

Or, you can do as we did, and just go as a couple, and enjoy the serenity you'll find there.","Date of stay: February 2018","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I slept better here than anywhere with the sounds of the frogs and the ocean waves. Super quiet though, almost eerie. Only one other couple at the whole place. Never saw any staff. The place should really have a restaurant/bar, but it doesn't and it is pretty far from Hilo to drive in for a meal. Service was basically non-existent, you are on your own.

We booked it after office hours & called the provided number & the property manager, Kate, worked with us to get us in the bungalow late that night.
To say the property is beautiful is an understatement.  There are flowering plants of all sorts amidst the huge palms, mostly various colors of hibiscus.  There is an awesome saltwater pool and beautiful gazebo all sitting atop about a 200 ft cliff shore.
There are only three bungalows which makes for a very low occupancy, so most of the time we had the property to ourselves.
Our bungalow was very modern & spacious with  a gorgeous bathroom.
There was a flat panel tv, fridge, microwave, and a Keurig machine.  There was a gas grill outside which we used to grill steaks one evening. 
The daily service is optional due to the management's desire to maintain privacy.  We had no problems with getting fresh towels, and we simply put out our trash bag to be picked up.
If we ever come back to the Big Island this is the place we will be staying!

Beautiful views. Our own lanai with our own grill. A great kitchenette we used frequently. The room is quite large. The bathroom was perfect. The bed was super comfortable. So much so, that we pulled up the sheets to see who made it (tempur-pedic), because we'll likely get one too. 
The staff was very helpful and polite. 
You enter the property through a secure gate. I don't know if you really need it secured excepted from curious tourist. We were enjoying a few relaxing moments at the gazebo when we spied whales. What a treat! We also enjoyed the hot tub. 
The only real drawback of the resort, was the location. It's about a 20 minute drive from downtown Hilo. Not a big deal for most, but we were there to see family in town. Not really a vacation trip for us. We were unable to find a decent room in town. So many of the Hilo hotels are really run down. Lai Nani is quite new and lovely.
To find it, go to mile marker 16 on the ""belt"" road heading North of Hilo. The entrance to a frontage road is right there, ocean side. Pull into the community frontage road, turn left.

We stayed at Lai Nani for 5 days 4 nights, and it was one of our most enjoyable stays. 

The place is run and managed by Cory and his team. They did a fantastic job in keeping the place neat and tidy. Every morning we would see them doing gardening and cleaning the estate! Great dedication from the team.

There are three bungalows in the estate for stay, and ours was nearest to the ocean. It was really great. We would wake up and walk out to the yard and we would see the ocean. There's even a common pavilion right at the end of the backyard which has the best spot to chill and admire the view. It was breathtaking. Cory mentioned that during whale season, they would even come very near to the estate!

The estate also has a pool, jacuzzi and bar area for people to enjoy. The pool is sonar powered so in the night, the water still remains warm which is fantastic. And at the bar by the pool, there's a cable to link up to phones for music. And the best part is that the speakers are also linked to the pavillion and the surrounding pool area! We were just so wow-ed by all the fine details and planning that went into this place to make guests truly enjoy their stay.

The bungalow was also very cosy, with a king size bed, mini kitchenette pantry (including a fridge and coffee maker), toilet, wardrobe area and sofa seating. It was really spacious and very inviting! The decorations all around were very ""hawaiian"".

We were allowed to park at the estate (free parking) during our stay. The location is good, it is secluded but yet near enough the city/ Hilo area - around 15 minutes drive. There's a scenic point, ""Pepeekeo"", near here. We highly recommend it! It's 4km longer but the scenic view of the sea was amazing, and there's a little hiking route you can take that can be done in 10 minutes and brings you down to the bottom of the cliff.

There's also a famous and highly recommended zipline just right across the estate, around 3 minutes drive. Our only regret is that we didn't book in advance and didn't manage to get any slot on our last few days there.

Overall a great location, and a beautiful stay. A great place for honeymooners like us and couples especially!","Date of stay: July 2015","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

In reading the reviews below, I feel it might be helpful to describe why Lai Nani is such a special ""Resort"" to clear expectations. If by ""Resort"" one is referring to large upscale places with lots of facilities, activities, and ""reputations"", you won't find this at Lai Nani.

The true ""Resort"" quality of Lai Nani is that it can only has three rooms. So one has the solar heated pool, hot tub, gazebo, and fantastic bluff views of the ocean virtually to oneself. It is perfect for romantic couples just wanting to be into themselves, or families fed up with competing for pool side chairs/gazebos and noise (unless making it themselves). In season, there are so many whales in front of you, some nights are difficult to sleep with the noise they make breeching and tail flapping.

Those hoping for a dry side ""Resort"" on the cheap on the Big Island will probably be happier staying at one of the standard big hotels in Hilo.","Date of stay: January 2015","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Cory stayed up late to let us in, and after a brief tour, he handed us the keys and presented us with a surprise bottle of champagne in honor of our recent wedding!!

I fell in love with the place just looking at it on their website, but in real life it was much more than I expected. First of all, the place itself is absolutely stunning, with a panoramic ocean view, beautiful garden, lawns, gazebo (with a fan!), a pool with a little waterfall, etc. If I believed in paradise, this is how it would look. 
Our pool side bungalow was very clean and comfortable, with a giant bed and soft pillows. Had a surprisingly good sleep there - I rarely sleep well on our trips because I almost never feel as relaxed as I did at Lai Nani.
Every morning I would wake up with birds, make myself coffee and came out to the gazebo to watch the sun rise and the whales. Every night we would spend at least an hour star gazing, the sky is so beautiful there. And during the days… There are lots of things to do during the days. Stay in and watch the wales, have cocktails in the gazebo, dip in the pool or soak in the adjacent hot tub. Or drive around and have fun. My husband and I are not into beach activities, but there are plenty of other things to do on the east side of Hawaii Island. Lai Nani is located about 15 minutes north of Hilo and almost next door to spectacular Akaka falls, Botanical Gardens, zip lining, horseback riding and other entertainment.  If you drive through Hilo to the south, you’ll find black sand beaches and the volcano park. Or drive all the way down south and hike to the green sand beach or just take a look at the beautiful bright blue water of the southernmost point of the US. 
The greatest part of what we liked about our stay at Lai Nani were the people and, most of all, the owner of the place, Garry. When we arrived he welcomed us with his open arms and guided us around the place and the bungalow while talking about the island activities. We had dinner reservations for my birthday, but then we were invited by Garry to share dinner with him and his friends and other guests. Garry made a fabulous prime rib with all the works and we enjoyed the company and wine on the terrace. I was surprised when the hosts took out the cake with candles to celebrate my birthday, which was completely unexpected, but so-so touching and wonderful. “You come as a guest and leave as friend,” Garry says and you believe that he really means it.
The last but not least, Garry talked us into a zip lining with the Umauma Experience and a helicopter trip with Paradise Helicopters (and I am afraid of heights. At least I thought so).  Both places were fantastic and highly professional and gave us great discounts after we mentioned Garry’s name and Lai Nani.","Date of stay: January 2014","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Although this review is long overdue - and my apologies for the tradiness - My partner and I stayed with Gary and Cory back in June of 2012, hiring a car and touring the Hawaiian islands for a month.  We spent 3 nights here and couldn't have been happier.  Upon arriving Cory took us on a guided tour of the grounds and the local area, explaining all the attractions and suggesting activities for us to do.

The rooms/bungalows were clean, tidy and well supplied - from a self catering perspective all we wanted was the BBQ and a local shop to buy groceries from, which although not a walk away was only a 10 minute drive.  But you do have microwave etc.

The bed was comfy, the sheets clean - and we got 3 very well rested nights here after a lot of walking and exploring through the day.

The tireless work that goes into maintaining the grounds does not go unnoticed - we were blown away by its beauty, spending our evenings in an Eden like paradise with the pool all to ourselves and the music system playing our selection of music from the iPod as we relaxed and took in the place.

In short this is a sublime place, although a little out of the way from the main town, we enjoyed that as our goal was to have a road trip - it was lovely to come back to a friendly welcome and a beautiful home.

Lai Nani is beautiful with gorgeous gardens and a lovely pool and hot tub overlooking the ocean. The room we stayed in was air conditioned, comfortable and right by the pool. We especially enjoyed the stunning ocean views. However, we were disappointed that the room was not cleaned daily. We had to wash our own dishes from the breakfast that we prepared ourselves, and would have liked fresh towels. The owner and his son were very friendly and would have provided extra towels if we had asked, but it would be better to not have to ask for everything. Guests already have to ask beforehand to turn on the hot tub since the switch was in a locked box. We also ended up with ants that got into some food that we had purchased. It would also be a good idea for the owners to put some sort of shade or curtain up in the bathroom for a feeling of privacy for guests who are showering.","Date of stay: April 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

BUT at $250/night there were some real deficits with this place.
1.  At similar properties we've stayed at in various place around the world, a breakfast is included in the cost.  NOTHING here.
2.  Woke up to ants in bed the second night morning we were there.  Yes, they were tiny and ""only"" about 3-4 but ick.  Politely mentioned to owner and basically were told that they love food sitting around and that we should make sure it was all put away.  Which leads to the next issue:
3.  No cleaning or room service the entire 4 nights.  We are pretty tidy people, but garbage still accumulates.  No bed change or remaking.  Extra towels stored under sink, but no dirty linen removed.  
4.  Two tiny bars of soap you would find at cheap motel and little shampoo sample.  This is not what I expect with the high cost of the room.  Yes, a Motel 6, but not here.

5.  Shower is badly designed.  Only hot water available from solar tank on top of roof.  No cool water and you have to sort of play with the water a lot to be able to shower.  The shower head is in the ceiling and you can't turn on water without getting drenched in hot water and jumping back out as quickly as possible.  The floor is sloped so much that you must straddle the drain and hope you don't slip while attempting to wash your feet.

6.  While not really snooty about furnishings, it's got the look of tacky island 80's.  Needs updating.  
 7.  Bathroom window lacks privacy.  Not frosted glass and sloping walkway allows views of your bathroom at night that were really freaky.

There is A/C which is nice, but owner let us know how much the electric bill was each month.  We didn't mind turning it off and saving the electricity but do guests really need to hear how much his bill is?  He also mentioned nearly every time we saw him how much upkeep there is to the place and how hard he works to maintain it.  Just seemed tacky and inappropriate to share that with guests.  It felt like he was inflating the price of the place to keep up with his landscape costs.  Had to tell us how much money he'd spent on plants.  Very off-putting. 

So,all in all we would never spend this kind of money for an ocean view again.  We've stayed in many places while vacationing and adapt well to all kinds of accomodations so aren't as fussy as it might sound.  Just be aware of these issues and if they don't bother you, spent all the money you want for the view.","Date of stay: May 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_20"

Lai Nani Resort! My journey to the 'Big Island' began when I stood at the top of the stairs at Lai Nani and looked out at the amazing view of the endless miles of the Pacific Ocean where the view appears to never end. Seeing and hearing the sounds of the Humpback Whales, and at times hearing nothing but the palm fronds blowing in the wind. Lai Nani is truly a sight to see, and one of the most amazing places I've ever been! The grounds are stunning, customer service outstanding, and talk about clean! On top of all of that, Garry and his son Cory (owners of Lai Nani) greet you with open arms and make you feel like your part of the family. Garry and Cory are extremely knowledgable of the local area, as well as the 'Big Island' itself. They go above and beyond to make sure your stay is a memorable one, and to top it off, you leave with two new friends! Lai Nani is as timeless as the ocean, and will definitely return.

We never noticed this location off of Hwy 19. When we were planning this visit we saw this location on line and booked it. 

I was skepticle at first. The pictures did not seem to match the island and all the rocky terrain. However, once my wife and I arrived I must say the pictures on line did not lie. The property is magnificent. The grounds are lined with Hawaii's typical color plants, lots of trees and the view was SPECTACULAR. 

The cabana was just as described. The bed and bathroom were modern and the small refridgerator and sink were sufficient since we spent very little time there. The bed was very comfortable.

The pool was a 10 step walk from our door and the early moprning swims were great. the pool was warm to 78 degrees which was perfect. 

The gated grounds make you feel secure. The owner Gary was very warm and friendly. He shared some of his stories and even took us on a tour in his little quad buggy.

They were all within a easy day's drive.  The pace is relaxed and comfortable. There are many very good, reasonably priced restaurants in Hilo, 15 to 20 minutes away.  The cottage has a large refrigerator, microwave, and grill, to allow eating in, if that is desired.  The owner and his son have built and run a very special place.

This is a spectacular place for a vacation on a beautiful estate, not merely a rental.  The 5 star rating I gave it encompasses the aloha/hospitality of the owner, Garry and his son Corey.  Garry wants you to leave as friends of his forever and it almost seems like his personal mission to do so.  We arrived at about 8 at night after a friend's recommendation to buy food and supplies before we got in.  Lae Nani is about 16 miles from any town, so you'll want to stock up first.  Not too much, though, it is only a small refrigerator and microwave (no stove) so light meals only.  We bought coffee, sandwiches, instant oatmeal, fruit (lots of local fruit!), rotisserie chicken, water.  We ate out for dinner most nights, but Garry, as others have mentioned, hosts a lovely dinner where you'll meet other guests and his local friends once during your stay.  Where else does this happen?  It is often said the Hilo side of the island is rainy, but we only experienced intermittent showers in the 5 days we stayed in January.  The gardens are magnificent and the view is one of the most spectacular we have seen in many years coming to Hawaii (all islands).  Whales were off-shore and we saw some mothers with babies and some showy males breaching right in front of us.  The property is about 125 feet high off the ocean and you have a panoramic view.  The bungalow/cottage is large and clean, has a safe which is really not needed, the property is gated and has excellent security as you would expect at a property this special. Hilo is a blue collar town, but Lae Nani is the best luxury experience you can get in these parts.  I had mixed feelings writing this review as I want Lae Nani to be there for us when we return!

Garry wants you to leave as friends of his forever and it almost seems like his personal mission to do so.  We arrived at about 8 at night after a friend's recommendation to buy food and supplies before we got in.  Lae Nani is about 16 miles from any town, so you'll want to stock up first.  Not too much, though, it is only a small refrigerator and microwave (no stove) so light meals only.  We bought coffee, sandwiches, instant oatmeal, fruit (lots of local fruit!), rotisserie chicken, water.  We ate out for dinner most nights, but Garry, as others have mentioned, hosts a lovely dinner where you'll meet other guests and his local friends once during your stay.  Where else does this happen?  It is often said the Hilo side of the island is rainy, but we only experienced intermittent showers in the 5 days we stayed in January.  The gardens are magnificent and the view is one of the most spectacular we have seen in many years coming to Hawaii (all islands).  Whales were off-shore and we saw some mothers with babies and some showy males breaching right in front of us.  The property is about 125 feet high off the ocean and you have a panoramic view.  The bungalow/cottage is large and clean, has a safe which is really not needed, the property is gated and has excellent security as you would expect at a property this special. Hilo is a blue collar town, but Lae Nani is the best luxury experience you can get in these parts.  I had mixed feelings writing this review as I want Lae Nani to be there for us when we return!  Hope you enjoy it as much as we did!","Date of stay: January 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I have stayed at 5 star resorts on the Island of Hawaii and the resort at La`i Nani is far better than those 5 star resorts or private estates on the island! The hospitality of Garry and his staff is outstanding. The cleanliness of the estate is impeccable. Garry had some many different suggestions on things to see and visit, it was like he was a ""official"" of the island. The estate has tropical plants from all over the island and is like a botanical garden. It's really hard to say what part of the estate was the best experience, they all were very good. The rooms, the pool, the gardens, the hospitality, the views, it all was a wonderful experience!. I will be making many referrals to all my friends!!!

We were greeted by Garry and his son the moment we arrived and felt very welcome. They ensured that every need was met. The grounds were immaculate and the bungalows were clean. The estate is near many of the attractions on the Hilo side and Garry steered us to many of the best activities. We traveled with another couple and two teenage girls. We all have a blast. Garry was very hospitable and he was very gracious. He had us for a barbecue where we and another guest contributed sides. It was great fun.

The views are incredible and the pictures do not do them justice. We greeted each morning in the oceanfront gazebo where we experienced some of the most glorius sunrises we had ever seen. You feel as if you are on your own private estate. There are no crowds or noise, except nature. We had a fantastic time and we will definitely be back.

It was far more beautiful than we could have imagined.  Lai Nani is located on the Hamukua Coast minutes from Hilo and yet still close to the attractions near the white sand beaches of Kohala.  The resort is literaly across the street from the Botanical Gardens and Waterfalls. There is a little town Honomu a few minutes up the road with shops and restraunts, all of which are very nice.  The location is private and yet convienent.  Perfect for anyone looking to explore the island.
The owner Gary is absolutely wonderful.  He invited us to several dinners at his home and made us feel like friends not a paying customer.  The sincerity and hospitality in unsurpassed.  This is the kind of treatment you get at a five star resort, except much better and more personal.  The grounds are lovely with spectacular ocean views.  The pool and hot tub are terrific after a long day...the bungalows are brand new and decorated lovely, with comfortable bed, flat screen tv with sitting area, mini kitchen and large walk in shower.

We arrived late at night and were amazed by the beauty of the property which was beautifully lit. It was breathtaking and we couldn't believe that this was going to be our home for the next 10 days. We rented the whole property with our large party of 12. It was like having a 5 star resort all to ourselves. The set up of the main house and two bungalows was perfect for a large group and several families. 
We felt so at home and welcomed. From the first minute Gary, the owner treated us like family. He was so attentive to our every need. We truly felt like this was our home during our stay. 
The grounds were absolutely gorgeous and we enjoyed morning coffee while watching the whales. The pool and hot tub were beautiful, we spent a lot of time sunning by the pool and making family meals in the gourmet kitchen and the state of the art barbecue. We made so many memories! 
The rooms and inside of the house were wonderful. The beds were very comfortable and each room had its own flat screen tv and luxurious bathroom and shower. All rooms in the main house had large sliders to the lanai which we left open at night to listen to the ocean and the whales. 
This is a special place. Gary has thought of truly everything to make the guest experience unforgettable from state of the art sound equipment to a gorgeous gas fireplace to a high tech washer/dryer. 
We truly had the time of our lives and we plan to return as soon as possible. The property, hospitality, and experience will not disappoint. Lai Nani is RIGHT ON! Mahalo!","Date of stay: February 2010","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

They were not very generous with supplies either- I think there was one extra roll of toilet paper and one extra
garbage bag.    The sofa bed was old and in pretty bad condition.   We ended up purchasing an air mattress because there was no way anyone was going to get any sleep on that thing.And i was really unimpressed when we got locked a few days before we were due to check out.  .The door code had got changed without notifying us.

We stayed in Unit 801 which has a great floor plan and nicely furnished.  The unit though is showing signs of aging which was apparent in broken blinds lading to the patio.  The management company is doing a very poor job: on check in we were missing all sorts of items such as kitchen dish soap, no sponge, a single trah bag, no soap for the dishwasher, a  single partial roll of toilet paper in the bathroom among other issues.  The blender smelled as if something died inside of it.  On the positive side, the sleep experience was good, quiet with good bedding.

This is not a hotel but indivudual condos.  There is no restaurants or bars on the property but it is a great place to stay.  We had a large, well appointed 2 story, 2 bedroom, 2 bath condo.  The master bedroom is upstairs and well appointed with a walkin closet.  The bed was comfortable.  The downstairs had a well appointed kitchen with a dining and sitting area.  The second bedroom had 2 single beds and a cot in it.  We were situated very close to the family pool.

It is peaceful.  The resort is gated.  The grounds are wonderful.  The only challenge is that you have to drive if you want to eat out.

My experience being in a large group on this resort, is to go to Costco and get your food and drinks.  By the time you get done with the day, you are ready to slow down for the evening.  This place does have BBQ in the pool area and you need a key to get into the pool/BBQ area and a key to get out.

All in all, I would recommend this resort to couplees with children or to anyone looking for peace and quiet.","Date of stay: August 2019","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Nice place but had some issues

Pros - great location convenient access via rental car to area. Staff pleasant upon check in and phone calls were answered promptly. We had booked a one bedroom with sofa bed and since the condo didn’t have a sofa bed were given a second bedroom with two twins that worked great for my kids. My kids loved the pool. And hot tub. A lot ! 🏊‍♀️ Very close to our unit. Coffee and tea was provided daily with phone call requests as advertised. 

Cons - ANTS 🐜 in the upstairs bathroom. Called staff the next morning nothing was done that I am aware of as there were still ants the next night. Since our family was staying the following night at volcanos national park overnight I asked for the bugs to be treated. So came back on day 4 to an upstairs that smells of insecticide but not more ants. Cont open a window to ventilate due to heat outside and no upstairs fans.  Turns out on day 6 the ants reappeared in the downstairs bathroom. 😵

Downstairs bathroom toilet occasionally runs - probably some slow leak internal (?) we saw nothing leaking external. Annoying but can deal with it. Upstairs bed hard as a rock. No mattress topper. Worst bed ever. Kids beds were fine. This condo only has AC that you cannot set below 74 and one fan in the main area so the bedrooms get very stuffy at night. I hope for future travelers they install ceiling fans or something in the bedrooms since you really can’t open the windows due to humidity and heat outside. No view to speak of just looking at other condos. No golf course view. We were in 1901

Parking sucks. Most spots are reserved and there was not a designated spot for our unit so we had to frequently park further away. No shuttle and most things are over a mile away or more so have to drive or taxi.  

Additional notes  not good or bad just FYI - pool and bath towels and bedding were provided as was the daily coffee and newspaper on request. Plenty of dishes and and full kitchen. But no spices, condiments, etc. no day passes to the Hilton or other pools as other reviews had mentioned. No beach toys as other reviewers encountered. 

Not sure if we would return here. Kinda on the fence for us on that one","Date of stay: August 2019","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

- great location: close to the beach, shopping centre, food court... & don’t miss the sunset at the lava lava beach club !
- nice, quiet (when we were there) and clean pools 
- spacious villa 
- excellent customer service : we had an issue with the AC in our first villa. I called the office, 20 minutes later an engineer was here. Unfortunately he wasn’t able to fix it, 15 minutes later the office called me back offering to relocate us in a bigger villa and they offer us a discount 

However small things made I don’t go with 5 stars:
- cleaning : I am not the only complaining when I read the comments. The cleaning is really imperfect and must be improved : dirty towels, dirty floors (hairs, dust...). 
- equipment : understanding we are in a villa we can’t except to have everything but small thing like sponge, kitchen towel, salt & peppers... would be appreciated.
- don’t forget it’s not a villa dedicated to be rent, this is someone’s house so you can have some pictures of them in the bedside table... quite strange sometimes...

We booked our trip through Costco, hoping it would be a well maintained unit. We stayed in a 3 bedroom, Unit 605, and figured renting the larger one would mean it was a nicer one as well. I even called the office at Aston a couple times before we got there, to make sure we would have a cleaner unit, with one of my grand kids beginning to crawl. We checked in later in the day and within an hour of my granddaughter crawling on the living room carpet, her knees and feet were black from the dirty carpet. Based on many other reviews, we thought that beach gear, chairs and other items would be available for our use, but there was nothing in the unit like that. We went to sweep the tile floors and there was no broom. We decided to use the vacuum that was in a closet but the tank had been removed, so we couldn't use that either. There are also no dish towels or sponges, so make sure you bring your own.The garage, several kitchen cabinets and some of the closets were locked so we had to access to those. It appears the owners and property management company take very little care of this unit and Costco will be made aware of this. I hate writing bad reviews but I also want to protect others in the future. As far as the complex goes, it is very clean and the pools are well maintained.

The pictures you see on interval's site for their rentals is not what we ended up with.  Let's first start with check in.  You check in off-site, which is really not a terrible thing, more of a hassle because it's in the Queen marketplace where parking is not adequate and your first time going it's a small challenge to find offices.  Secondly office staff is super friendly and helpful and I want people to know that through this ordeal the staff was great especially Emmie and Hailey.  Sorry for the spelling.  We first checked into unit 1001 and then 1401 and to be blunt we were very appalled that Interval would allow the use of these condos.  I'm not exxagerating when I say filthy stained carpets in both, heavily used, dinged up, dirty couches, tables, chairs and then hairs in shower stalls.  We spent the night in 1401 but asked again to be moved.  Please believe me that I wouldn't take off my flip flops and walk on either units carpetting in barefeet.  The next day Emmie helped us find  unit 1703, which just happens to be the unit you see on intervals site and it was beautiful.  So my suggestion is to make sure you know what unit you are getting and demand to see pictures.  Units 1401 and 1001 are not acceptable and I will be contacting interval to let them know about this situation.

Last February my family and I booked our trip to Hawaii to attend my nephew's high school graduation in May. We planned to stay for five days at the Big Island. We were going to stay at Royal Kona Resort through a family discount. However two weeks prior to my Hawaii trip we ended up not getting the reservation. Desperately at the eleventh hour on Friday before Cinco de Mayo my cousin's girlfriend booked this place. Even though we were about 45 minutes away from our original destination to stay we had no choice but to book the reservation at this place as everything else was booked.

Where you stay affects your itinerary. By staying here I had to change my itinerary. If things don't go as you plan you have to make the most of it. Even though I wasn't able to stay at Royal Kona Resort there were some benefits of staying here. First this place is about 2 minute drive away from Queens Market Place, which not only was the pickup destination for the Kohala Waterfall Tour but also there was grocery place Island Gourmet Markets and Starbucks that serves Kona Coffee, which you can't find at any Starbucks on the mainland. Second unlike the busy resorts full of tourists this place is separated from all the noise because you're staying at a condo. Third this condo is very safe as you don't have to worry about theft as this a gated facility. The house we stayed at was a two-story with 3 three bedrooms. In this facility there is a tennis court and swimming pool. During my 5-day stay here on the last week of May I had a relaxing, quiet time here. 

There are drawbacks staying here. First unlike the resorts that are situated next to a beach this condo isn't close to a beach that is walking distance. Second is this condo is more expensive than a resort. Third and the most important is you are responsible for cleanup through the usage of the kitchen and bathroom. By staying at a resort you don't have to worry about the cleanup. I'll be honest my rating had to do by not staying at a hotel and ended up by staying here at the last minute. 

This place isn't for everyone. If you're with family I believe a resort would be more beneficial. However if you plan to have a bachelor or bachelorette party this place would be more useful and convenient than staying at a resort. At the end it all depends on you where to stay.","Date of stay: May 2018","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

It was very nice.  Where we had to check in at the Queens shopping center was quite a ways from the actual condos.  The staff was very helpful and friendly, especially Emmie.  Every time we interacted with her, she was so willing to help us with anything we needed.  You had to go into Aston's office to get extra coffee, shampoo, soaps, detergent , etc..  which was kind of a pain.  The condo itself was very nice, parking was kind of an issue.  Not a lot of spaces for people that rent in the facility, I think it was more owner occupied.  The swimming pool area was very slippery and dangerous when wet.  I saw several little kids falling down and the edge of the pool was very sharp, saw a man cut  his foot.

This is the same property, but possibly different units than those available through Aston, but it's the same overall development/neighborhood/property.

Wiakoloa village is a great place to stay and this condo complex was perfect for the price, location, and amenities.  The unit itself is a well designed townhome with minimal shared walls, was spacious and very comfortable.  The bed arrangements were perfect for our family (two singles for the kids, a queen for grandma, and a king for mom and dad), the kitchen/dining area was well stocked and had more than ample space, and the living room with very tall ceilings had a great feel to it.  There was a HUGE grass/green space out the back sliding doors, which was perfect for the kids to let themselves out and play.  The appliances were new and efficient making it as easy as being home to get the dishes and laundry done.  The only thing I would change if I were building it myself would be to increase the outdoor patio space.  Also the owners/managers go out of their way to say you get a ""starter"" amount of laundry detergent/dish soap etc...  We were very pleasantly surprised to find enough supplies (garbage bags, soap/detergent, shampoo, etc...) to probably last a month.  Lastly, it was really great to have a nice collection of beach chairs, beach umbrella(s), boogie boards, tennis equipment, some sand toys, and towels galore.  All this stuff is really hard to travel with and we were very happy to have it in Hawaii waiting for us without having to spend a bunch of money to gear up on arrival.  They even had some basic cooking things like oils (vegetable and peanut), salt, pepper, balsamic, and a few other things.  The kitchen supplies, pots/pans, dishes, were better and more numerous than anything we have at home.

This particular unit was nice in that it was across the street from one of the pools.  The pool was also wonderful.  It was warm, but refreshing. It was really fun to swim under the stars without being too cold.  The hot tub was large and accommodating.  The grills around the pool made making a poolside lunch/dinner easy and fun.  My wife enjoyed the work out facilities and there are many paths and lots of space in the roadways for running/biking and kid play.

Having the pass to the Hilton was the icing on the cake.  While it's a bit of an outing/effort to navigate the resort because it's so big, it is a wonderful perk to have.  We had one day where it was too windy to be on the beach and we were able to retreat to the Hilton for more fun in the sun instead of feeling like we had to retire to the room or condo pool.  It's a very easy to walk there from the rental, however, with two younger kids and LOTS of pool and sand toys it was only practical to drive.  The kids (ages 3 and 6) did scooter with me to the Hilton while my wife drove and we met up in the parking lot to gear up.  It's also easy and fun to head over to the Hilton for their luau and its nice to have free parking for the event, too.

In the end I would highly suggest the Wiakoloa Village Resortica as an excellent location and we really enjoyed this rental as an outstanding place for your Hawaiian adventures.","Date of stay: April 2018","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Beautiful quiet resort. There were 8 of us.We booked 2, 2 bedroom condos and requested close together. At check in we were put as far apart as possible, but asking asking they made changed to get us closer. Our one friends condo was comfy and wonderful, ours not so much. We stayed in 1901. You could tell it was 
 a rental and no worry for it. The dishwasher has a screw holding the water line in place...so cleans terribly. The handle of the scissors was broken off, no tea towels or dish rags ( after the cleaner came she took them and we never got them back. and there was only one of each.) No broom, so we kindly asked the cleaner to help get us one which she did. The couches were terribly uncomfortable and broken and the table and chairs in kitchen...well so rickety..3 times friends fell on the floor once hitting there head on the island because the floor was so slippery and the chairs so bad!! Our tv's were soooo old...in fact one upstairs was a VCR combo that was quite small.  The fact we got 3 channels didnt help. Now....to me I just think that there needs to be checks done all on rentals before the people show up to rent to make sure things are up to par. We paid alot of money...same as our friends and did not receive nearly the same quality.
That being said, we never had an issues getting a space at the pool...was very clean and beautiful,,loved the hottub as the weather wasnt always the greatest. There is no beach in walking distance...you must drive. The area its self is wonderful...but not cheap at all to shop for groceries there! A loaf of bread is $8.99 US! Amazing Thai restaurant and best Maui ribs in food court ever!. 
Over all we had a great times, how could we not ...we are in Hawaii beating the snow! However, our place was such a dissapointment for what we paid. I wish we requested photos of the condo we were paying for first.

Everything was reasonably clean but not in pristine condition, especially the stove must have endured some minor chefs before.

There are a tennis court and two smallish pools available to guests. Since we were there at the busiest time of the year, there were not enough chairs available, one morning the pool was completely closed for no apparent reason.

We booked our flights, hotel and car rental through Costco, so the price was a good value, overall.

The Aston Waikoloa Colony Villas appear to be owned by private parties and then rented out to visitors when the owners are not using them. Aston is the management company and they handled all of our arrangements when we arrived. 

The condos are well appointed and fully furnished. Depending on the owner (I suspect) they may also come with a couple of beach chairs, boogie boards and other beach accessories. There are beach towels available to use (I counted 8) during the week.

The kitchen is nicely appointed with just about anything you'll need during your stay. Television and game consoles also came with our condo. 

The location is good, walking distance from two shopping centers which include restaurants (from food court fare to fine dining), grocery, clothing and gift boutiques, and a soon-to-open movie theater. 

Views from your lanai are mostly golf course and other buildings, but not unpleasant. The lanais are spacious and comfortable. The bathrooms were also spacious and everything worked fine.  If you need to re-stock toilet paper, towels and other similar items, a quick call to the management company will result in someone bringing to your door in short order.

I'd give the Villas a 5 if it were for a few things: You will need a car if you want to go to the beach...it's a bit far to actually walk...and we like to walk! It wasn't clear from the ads that this was the case and in fact, was a bit misleading in that regard. Read the ad copy CAREFULLY. The furniture was fine, but the sofas were a bit uncomfortable, likely due to frequent use.  The carpet was also in need of replacement...again, frequent use and some staining.

Also of note: The gym and pool were unavailable for several days during our stay. I certainly understand that this is a transitory problem as both were undergoing renovation. As a result, the small gym has all new resistance training equipment...very nice!

Not sure if we would return to the property on our next visit. The beach access issue is a pretty big one. That said, good value for what you get...just be advised.","Date of stay: October 2017","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Check in was seamless and all requests were honored (including upgrade).  Registration staff was full of Aloha – really wonderful people.  They gave us the 2 bedroom upgrade for 25$/night!  Because of the varied reviews on TA, our expectations were not high, but first impressions were very very good.  We entered our condo (2301) and found a HUGE (1700 sq feet) 2 story condo.  2 lanais, 2 bedrooms, 2 full baths, full kitchen with dining area and bar.  The condo also included a stacked washer and dryer with detergent and dryer sheets. In the closets were beach chairs, noodles, and other beach goodies.  My family loved staying here.  The location was next to Hali’I Kai (where we picked up the Ala Kahakai Trail), and short drive to Lava Lava, Anaeho’omalu Bay and the Kings Shops.  During our stay the resort was very quiet and we only saw a few families at the pool, or grilling at the BBQs.  During check out I noticed a cleaning fee added to our bill.  I asked about it because there was no mention of additional cleaning fee in our Hotwire contract.  I showed the contract/receipt to the staff and all was well.

The unit was comfortable and very spacious and appeared to be clean.  However, starting on our third night we experienced an unnerving bug infestation.  On two consecutive nights there bugs running around the kitchen counters, cupboards and floor.  We killed at least a dozen of the little bastards on the counters one night.  This forced us to keep all of our food (including the Cheerios) in the refrigerator.

After being notified the condo management was quite responsive.  I think they may have sprayed some pesticide because after that we only found another five or six bugs.  Without being asked to do so they refunded the standard cleaning deposit and daily resort fee, which we appreciated.

Overall I'm giving this property a neutral rating.  The responsive management and spacious condo served to counterbalance the herd of bugs to some extent.  We'll try someplace else next time, however.","Date of stay: April 2017","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

After looking at other people’s reviews and seeing the pictures they posted, I am sure there are some nice units at this complex. Unfortunately, I think we must have gotten the lemon out of the bunch. We reserved a one bedroom. Upon arrival, we were told we were going to be put in a two bedroom, presumably because all the one bedrooms were taken.  

Check-in was a breeze. You check in at a different Aston property (Aston Shores). The gal working there was very friendly and did a good job explaining everything. We drove to our unit and were able to find a parking spot right outside the door. I know some other reviewers have complained about not being able to find parking close to their assigned unit, but during our entire stay we were always able to get the same spot right outside the door. 

 The unit we were assigned (#1401) was a two-story with two bedrooms and two bathrooms. The condo included a stove/oven, coffee maker, toaster oven, blender, plates, silverware, refrigerator/freezer, iron/ironing board, extra beach towels, snorkeling equipment, boogie boards, and some golf clubs (with no golf bag?). 

The first thing we noticed when we walked in was how tired everything looked. The carpet was old and the walls had seen one too many suitcases bumped up against them. The overall cleanliness of the place was fine, but the maid service can only do so much before the owner needs to pony up and repaint and re-carpet the place. 

There was some furniture in the living room which included a chair and couch (pull-out bed), but the couch was uncomfortable and slanted forward which caused you to roll off if you tried to lay on it. Basically there was no place in the unit to get comfortable and relax with the exception of one chair or the bed. 

The vertical blinds covering the sliding glass door were mangled and cobbled together, and many of them were of varying lengths. Several of them wouldn’t turn and close (which is an annoying privacy issue for a ground floor door). I understand things on the island are a little more expensive than the mainland, but I have a hard time thinking these would be so expensive to replace that it would be cost prohibitive. 

The door led out to a small patio with a metal/glass table and four chairs. The chairs were made of metal so they are not comfortable. Only two of them still had cushions on them but these were so torn and tattered they had lost a lot of their cushioning ability. There was also a small balcony upstairs, but since there was no furniture on it, it was pretty much worthless. 

The upstairs bedroom had a ceiling fan, but no ceiling light. The light was provided by several table lamps on the night stands and dresser. Two of the three lamps were broken and either didn’t have a knob to turn them on, or you had to use two hands to hold the broken lamp together so it didn’t move while turning the knob.

There were televisions in the living room and the upstairs bedroom but they were the old tube style. They worked, and we only used them to get the local news and weather reports, but it was just one more thing that led to the overall feeling of the place needing to be updated. 

To top things off, one night around 1am or 2am, one of the batteries in a smoke detector decided to die. OK, that happens even when we are at home. The problem was that we didn’t happen to bring any spare 9 volt batteries on vacation. We called the 24-hour emergency number they gave us when we checked in, but we just got a recording. We weren’t going to sit around and see if anyone called us back so I got a chair and took the alarm down, and, since they were all hardwired together, this caused the other ones to start beeping to let us know one of them was disconnected. Now I had to take them all down and place them on the counter………….only to have them all start beeping to let us know they were no longer receiving AC power. So, I find myself going out in the wee hours of the morning to take a bunch of beeping smoke alarms out to lock them in our rental car because I couldn’t find any other place to put them so they didn’t keep us awake all night.

At 8am the next morning the maintenance guy showed up to replace the battery. After I gave him the smoke alarms (that were very old and yellowed with age), he told me he needed to go get a bunch of new ones to put up. He said he would wait until we left for the day so as not to disturb us while he worked. He was a really nice guy and very friendly.

We really liked how big the upstairs bathroom and closet was. The water pressure and temperature in the shower were always good. They also had an in-room safe for use.  The grounds keepers do a great job and the exterior areas of the buildings were immaculate. 

There was a hiking trail through the lava fields called the Kings Trail which was only about 30 yards away from the door of the condo. Wear some decent shoes if you decide to explore the trail since the lava is sharp and will shred shoes with soft rubber soles. 

Overall we really like the Waikaloa area. We stayed at the Fairway Villas last year and were very happy with it. Our friends stayed at the Hilton and were also pleased. From reading other reviews of the Aston Colony Villas, it sounds like there might be some nice units for rent. Unfortunately, the one we had was not one of them. The Fairway Villas seemed a lot nicer and were less expensive (and still are).

It’s unfortunate that Aston isn’t able to implement a set of minimum standards that the condo owners need to meet for them to be able to continue to have Aston manage and rent out their units. Customers aren’t able to interact directly with the owners and have to put their trust in the management company to make sure that the product/service being provided is worth the amount of money being asked. I don’t feel that was the case during our stay.  We placed our trust in the Aston brand name and felt like we were let down. As such, in the future I’m not sure I want to roll the dice and gamble on what condition the room will be at an Aston property. 

The bottom line here was that the employees at the Aston Colony Villas are great. The location and the condition of the grounds were very nice, too. The condition of the particular unit we were put in was definitely not worth the price that we were charged. I understand that each of them has a different owner, and some are more willing to put money into the upkeep of theirs than others are.  There are probably some nicer units, but I can’t confirm this. I can only base my review on my own experience, and it wasn’t that impressive. 

I'm not saying that this was the worst place I've ever stayed at, far from it. I just would have been able to accept it a little easier if what we were charged was more in line with what we received.  I’ve stayed in tropical places where there was no air conditioning and I had to sleep under mosquito netting, which was fine because it was in line with what my research of the hotel, and the price I paid, led me to believe I would be getting.  With the exception of the alarms going off in the middle of the night, all the other issues are ongoing and would be observable during routine maintenance or inspections.","Date of stay: November 2016","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_20"

We had a friendly check-in at the Aston Shores and were impressed with the 1500 square foot two bedroom two bath unit.
   Aston manages about 19 units in the Colony Villas and they own about 50% of the units in Aston Shores. This location is across the street from the HGVC Bay Club and close to Kings and Queens shopping centers. Our unit was on the Waikoloa Beach golf course.
  The units come with a fully equipped kitchen, daily maid service and access to two pools and a fitness center.
   The rooms are nicely furnished and are beautifully decorated, the bountiful flowers and plantings around the site add to the tropical ambiance.
   The only concerns going forward would be to make sure your unit has an assigned parking space and bring a copy of your confirmation to the check-in office.","Date of stay: November 2016","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The only minor inconvenience was that the airco broke down during the before last night. We contacted the outrigger reception the next morning and their maintenance people came out. However they were unable to repair the unit (as a spare part was required). So we had to spent the last night in the high 80 despite having everything open to atain max airflow. Although the outrigger management handled the situation efficiently, i felt disturbed by their lack of understanding (the conversations were business efficiënt) for our situation. While they couldn't change the situation, a small gesture (e.g. An icecream bucket to cool off) could have made a world of difference.

The Waikoloa Beach Resort area is very nice. The Kings and Queens shops are very convenient and not too overly priced. We had a 2 bedroom 2 1/2 bath villa with a nice and well equipped kitchen. Some of the appliances are in need of an upgrade but overall wasn't too bad. The tile floor was loose and broken in spots and some of the carpet was wrinkled which was a little disappointing. No need to worry about parking at this villa as the garage is usable and accessible. Very nice to load and unload luggage, groceries, and beach supplies. The bed was comfortable and was able to get a decent nights sleep. The tvs could use an upgrade as the screens are small and at least one was an old CRT unit. You will not see anyone connected with the rental property during your stay at this villa so pay attention to the instructions they give you and everything will go smooth. We were able to get through the drive gates, find our villa and retrieve the keys to get in without any problems. Abbey Rentals did call us to make sure everything was okay and answer any questions we might have.

The place we stayed in was very tired such as needing a fresh coat of paint as there were marks and chipped paint on the walls. The carpet was definitely original as it had stains in areas and looked very worn and in the upstairs hallway was a water stain on the ceiling that looked more like a wine or grape juice stain. The staff was helpful as we had a broken coffee maker in our unit and they replaced it with one that worked the next day.
As for the parking spots, it looked like someone threw a dart at a picture of the parking lot and wherever that dart landed was the assigned number for that spot. For example there are 3 stalls for the units; 1404, a blank stall, and 1406. So where is 1405? Well it was in a side stall, before the condo unit assigned to it, with no signage directing where it is at. If you are looking for a basic base of operations for your vacation that is close to a golf course, this could work for you.

Overall, we had a nice stay, however the unit badly needs to be updated. One of the twin mattresses was so worn that it was impossible to sleep on it (I opted for the sofa bed instead--it ended up being more comfortable). The silverware was not a complete set, and one of the dining chairs had a large rip in the seat. The television is an old non-HD CRT, but we barely used it so that wasn't a big deal. Also, they have an annoying policy of setting the thermostat to a maximum low of 74, which to me is much too warm for sleeping. Even 72 would be more comfortable. Thd AC unit is right next to the lanai and is pretty loud when it kicks on, so that does intrude into the peaceful feeling. The property itself is nice and well-maintained, but it's a bit of a bother that there is no on site management office. Any time you need something (newspaper that is included in your amenities fee, DVDs, etc) you need to get in the car and go to a sister property.

1. Kona coffee - they do provide a packet for your first morning. You'll want more! 
2. Get your groceries in Kona too. Much less expensive than the resort store. 
3. If your luggage has room - buy sunscreen on the mainland - it's 33% to 50% cheaper. Also salt, pepper & oil (basics to cook with). 
4. DO buy rice (condo has a rice cooker! Easy); a $9 sarong (great cover up!); water shoes (lava & coral hurt!); macadamia nuts!! (Grown here); local rum ($20! The price of 1.3 Mai Tais) 
5. Some condos have ""leftovers "" (not food) - rather, boogie board, beach chairs, snorkel mask, etc.
6. You can pay a fee to use the resorts (marriott was $100, Hilton was $160) - day room plus access to their pools & beaches for a family of 4. Great! 
7. DO visit the Lava Lava club on resort - easy access to beach, snorkeling & best sunset views in comfy chairs (for the price of a Mai tai!) 
8. Buy fruit at one of the many fruit stands around Kona - in season mangos, bananas, papaya, etc are crazy delicious & very reasonable. 
9. It's hard to visit the volcano NP in one day. If you're from mainland, take advantage of the time change (eg - your body will wake up REALLY early) & go visit the park super early, early on. OR consider using ""AirBnB"" & stay overnight in Volcano or Hilo (lots to see & do!)

The complex is quite large with two pools, each nice with ample space. The condo was decent, large and backed onto the golf course.

A few drawbacks:

Distance:  it's a fair walk to the shops (20min). The beach is about 30-40min walk. We ended up driving everywhere while we stayed here.

Layout & Patios: the complex is strange in its layout. The A/C is on the patio side of the condos so we hardly used ours due to the noise. Eating dinner or relaxing was not enjoyable with the A/C running. 

The other thing we didn't like was that the patios are very closed in and small, and the lawn in front of each patio joins so we had screaming kids running past our dinner every day.

There are no BBQs on the patios which is a pain. However we did enjoy our picnics by the pool as there are BBQs there.

We reserved 2 x 3br townhouses that were convenient, safe (not much crime in Kona anyways) and parking next to units.  It was a two minute drive to the Waikoloa golf courses, eight minutes from Mauna Lani G.C., and 10-15 minutes from Mauna Kea GC.  Kona-Kailua town is a little ways off but not too far. There is a Costco, Target etc. for all things that you might need.  Waikoloa town is closer if you need groceries and run out of da Limu Poke.

Amenties:  Full modern kitchen to stay and cook yourselves, nice lanai, washing machine/dryer and only a short walk to gym was nice.  

Condition: Good with plenty of room to dine and ""talk story"" 

Staff: Helpful on check in and out.  It was a little hard to find the reception building as there were no signs or maps that we knew of directing us to the Aston checkin building that is located 5 minutes from the actual villas.

Price: Very reasonable for the unit size and location.  Highly recommended.","Date of stay: October 2014","Trip type: Traveled with friends","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We contacted the staff and were told it was because the sliding glass doors weren't shut completely.  When we came back to the room, the AC still did not work and it was 84 degrees inside.  We stayed a very sweaty night there, and contacted the staff again in the morning.  We were gone all day and came back to an 87 degree villa. When we contacted the staff again, they gave us another villa, which was very nice, but it meant we had to spend a part of our 3 day vacation moving again.  If they had listened to us in the first place instead of just telling us it was related to a door being open (which we did not see), it would have made for a much nicer experience, instead we wound up really frustrated.  On top of that, we purchased this as a special.  They did not bother to tell us it was a special price due to  Ironman Triathalon that was going on and that we would not be able to leave the property on that Saturday (we were only staying Fri and Sat night) due to the race.

We paid a little more to stay here at the Colony Villas than the Shores, but wanted to stay with the Aston brand because of good experiences in the past.  Once again we were checking in late, but with our experience from our last visit to the Shores, knew what to expect and the layout of the compound.  Check-in requires you to go to the Shores as there is no onsite office at the villas.  Driving up from the Shores, its just past the Hilton and Bay Club properties, on your left hand side.  It's easy to drive right by as the sign is tucked in the turn off, so go a little slower at night. 

The villas are spacious, like a stacked townhouse.  We chose the 2 bed 2 bath.  The master had a small lanai, a good sized king and clean spacious bathroom with tub and stand up shower.  The second bedroom had two TINY beds (realllllly tiny!!!) and the bathroom just outside the room with a tub and shower in one.  Downstairs had a 1 pc bathroom, nice spacious kitchen with modern appliances, furnished with blender, stove, oven, fridge-freezer, microwave, toaster - all the usual stuff.  The living area was HUGE, with double sliding door access and outdoor patio.  The furniture seemed a little dated/used, but the place was clean and easy to navigate. The villa had central air that was spotty at times, though the wind is often enough at night to cool the lower level.  The screen doors were a little rickety, so be sure to close them tight and proper if you're using them (There are huge flying cockroaches in Hawai'i, and you do not want them in your villa!)

Lots of stairs FYI, so this is not a location for the mobility impaired.  The size of the villas is accommodating for a large family or group.

Staff are always friendly and accommodating, so it really wasn't an issue with no office onsite, but that being said, it would've been nice to have the office there instead of making the trip. 

Grounds are lovely and well maintained and maid service, if its part of your package, is efficient, though carpets could use a thorough shampoo.  The villa also has a locker with water equipment for you to use (boogie boards, etc) though ours looked worn and haphazardly stored, so we opted out of using them.

We enjoyed our stay at the Colony Villas, and should we return to Hawai'i, we might consider another stay if the price is right.","Date of stay: August 2014","Trip type: Traveled with friends","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

We very much enjoyed our stay at the Waikoloa Colony Villas. We stayed in #2606. Out of all the rentals, on beach vacations, we have stayed in in the past, this was my favorite! We chose to stay in the townhouse instead of a hotel, even though they are very nice, because we wanted to be able to cook our own meals to save money. We do this when we go to the beach in Florida as well. On those trips, we are used to having to buy hand soap, dishwashing detergent, washing machine detergent, etc. We did not have to do that here, it was all provided! They even had a spice rack! All of this helped us save money on groceries. We usually have to buy all of those things, and then only use about half. We couldn’t have taken the rest home on the plane, so we were very appreciative of that. #2606 also provided everything we needed for the beach. They had beach chairs, beach towels, beach toys, an umbrella, and even a rolling cooler! Our flight back home was at 10:00 pm. We have a 4 year old, and he still takes naps. Check out time was 11:00. I read the info regarding check out,  which stated that there would be a $20 charge per hour for a late check out. We had already spent so much money on the trip itself, we really couldn’t afford that extra cost for our 4 year old to take a nap. We were going to have to spend the day hanging out in Kona until our flight. I sent the condo owner an email explaining our situation. He said that no one was checking in the following day, and gave us permission to stay as long as we needed, until our flight. This was so helpful. A 4 year old without a nap is rough! But then add jet lag to it and 11 hours of flying and it can really get bad! We were so thankful that he allowed us to stay past check out time! All of these things really helped to make our vacation much more enjoyable! Everything was super clean! The pools were great too! I would highly recommend a stay here for anyone traveling to the big island.","Date of stay: June 2014","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We knew at the outset that we would be checking in late and were told what the procedure was. Turns out it wasn't what we were told. You get there, it's late, you've been in a plane for hours and you're tired. You don't want to deal with answering services and get shuffled around from resort to resort to pick up your keys. Two days after finally checking in we received an email advising of a new check in procedure. Still cumbersome but would have been nice to get this info before checking in, not two days later. Aston is a fairly large operation and one would think they could improve on the whole check in procedure as a lot of visitors check in late.

Second negative - the Resort Fee. No mention of this when the unit was booked. I know Resort Fees are becoming more and more common and don't really have a problem with this, although I think it would be easier all around if they just upped the rate and be done with it. The fee included internet service (which worked fine), a daily newspaper (not fine because we were told if we wanted it we had to go to another resort to pick it up - ARE YOU SERIOUS?), and a daily supply of coffee. There were a couple of packets of coffee in the unit when we arrived, but nobody resupplied us. We phoned the office and were immediately provided with more coffee. It ran out and nobody resupplied us. We phoned again and again got more coffee. So this continued for two weeks. We could also utilize a free DVD rental service (if we wanted to drive down the road to another resort). Again this is a management issue that Aston needs to deal with.

Now for the positives. Nice spacious unit, well looked after, nicely furnished. Good sized pool area and good BBQ,s. The unit was spotless and the housekeeping service was great.

The absolute best thing was the staff we encountered. Whether it was office staff, housekeeping, gardeners, whoever, they were without exception genuinely pleasant, friendly, always helpful and perpetually had a smile for everyone.

We have previously stayed in Aston properties perhaps 5 or 6 times. While I think it's time that they took a long hard look at some of their operational deficiencies they are to be congratulated on keeping such a dedicated happy workforce as the face of their operation.","Date of stay: March 2014","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

We loved the fact that we were steps away from the pool. The gardens and grounds are pretty.  The unit was very spacious for the two of us and would be ideal for a family.  It would not work for couples traveling together as the master bed room on the 2nd floor is open to the downstairs area.

We liked the location as we were in the center of things that we wanted to do while on Hawaii and very close in driving distance to a couple of outstanding beaches.  You *will* need a car while here though, as it is a far walk on a hot lava field to the shopping complexes or beaches.

We felt the value of the unit was good too and appreciated that. But this  unit is in need of paint and new carpeting.  Just kinda tired decor.  No wifi.  Also, the windows were extremely dirty and in need of cleaning.  We were not in the condo much during the day, but it would've been nice to actually see the views.

The refrigerator froze everything, and the WiFi didn't work. It took 10 days to get the WiFi fixed. The fridge never completely functioned well. It took five phone calls to the Outrigger office to deal with these problems....
The resort has 27 buildings and each building has 6 units, two floors for each unit. There are no ocean views from the property. The center of the village is 1.2 miles away by the shortest route, which goes along a lava field and is treeless and hot if you walk while the sun is up.The more pleasant walk is about twice the distance. There is no public transportation between the village and Colony Villas. You have to drive everywhere, which means that if you want a drink at a restaurant for dinner, you have to appoint a designated driver or take your chances. There are only two barbecue grills on the property. The exercise room has one treadmill and two bikes, which is pretty stingy when you consider that at full occupancy, there would be at least 324 people at the resort. Yes, you're in Hawaii and you might like to walk or jog outdoors, but once the sun is up, the temps are in the 80s and not so great for vigorous exercise. The pool is a modest size. There are no facilities for children. I would not return because it's too far from the village and doesn't offer much in the way of walks, and the experience with the management office left a sour taste in the mouth.","Date of stay: February 2014","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

We had stayed here 2 years previous and the check-in was seamless at the front gate of the Colony Villas.
We arrived after hours (around 9:45 pm) from Canada, and unknown to us, the check-in procedure had changed in the last couple of months and the lock box was no longer at this property.  We contacted the after-hours people on the gate phone, who insisted that our reservation was at the Mauna Kea condos, not the Colony Villas, and promptly got cut off 3 times before getting instructed that our check-in lock box was at the Waikoloa Shores office.  After finding the Waikoloa Shores, we had no idea where the 'office' was (it is several hundred yards inside the complex) in the dark, and after several more keypad phone calls, getting told a couple more times that we were supposed to be at the Mauna Kea condos, and getting cut off a few more times, one of our party finally found the office after exploring for a half hour, at the same time the resort finally sent someone out to assist.  This fellow was extremely helpful, I don't know why anyone on the phone was so clueless.  Finally, by 11:30, we were in our condo, unit 2703.
Once in our condo, we were again disappointed by the furnishings and deficiencies.  The living area furniture and lanai furniture were 'industrial' looking and uncomfortable.  We wound up buying lawn chairs from Wal-Mart (and left them behind) to sit on outside.  The televisions were giant older TV's so big that the back of the TV stand in the living room had been cut out so it could fit, allowing all the noise from the TV to travel up the stairwell into the bedroom area.  The rugs were dirty.  The master bathroom toilet handle was falling off (I fixed this myself).  The shower door in the master bathroom didn't close  (meaning water got on the floor) as the magnets had fallen off and not been replaced.  The ceiling fan in the main floor half bath was so noisy it could not be turned on after anyone went to bed (this was bad because the light and fan were on the same switch).   The master bedroom opened up onto an upper lanai, which was nice and quiet when we went to bed, but faced onto a golf course where lawn mowing started before the sunrise (being Canadian, we had to have the windows wide open to keep cool).
Another item to consider was the community pool, everyone we spoke to at the pool was complaining that it was too cold to use (it is not heated), I went in it and found it uncomfortably cool.  The ocean was much warmer.  
Overall, not very impressed with this condo complex from the start.   
We did enjoy our holiday in spite of all this, however, we do recommend travelling to the Big Island for sure, just shop around for something better than these condos at the Waikoloa Colony Villas.","Date of stay: January 2014","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_20"

We were given a villa next to the road with a view to the rubbish bins and car park...this was very disappointing.  Our other accommodation so far had been great, both Aston run properties.

The villa inside was nice and well appointed, the garage was locked off, but hey the car was a rental so it could stay outside.  the configuration of the door upstairs to get into the bedroom and bathroom was a bit annoying and the windows didn't seem to open so we had to run the air-con.

We stayed off site for a couple of nights down in Volcano which gave us a break from the nothingness of this location.

If you know what villa you are getting and you are happy with its location this resort would be fine.  For me it was a let down for my holidays.

Also, they charge for Wi-Fi at this location, even though it was listed as an inclusion on my booking...the other Aston resorts it was included as specified on my booking.

The check in was easy and eficient. We've told that we could rent 2 dvd per day and was givem the keys, and card for the gate. 
 The  condominium is very well mainteined. We enjoyed walking around. 
One mile from kings shop and queen market so there were many places to go out for dinner if you do not want to cook. Close to the beach as well. Our daughter loved the pool and we spend time there too.","Date of stay: July 2013","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

A couple of the white towels in the master bathroom had never been washed and therefore left lint all over us.

We were a family -  teens, uncle, mom and dad-- and the layout of the unit accomodated everyone. Our particular unit was beautifully decorated, we thought, with real artwork and gorgeous island furniture.  The units have fully furnished kitchens and our unit also had beachtowels, beach mats, sand toys, and a drawer of games and books. Wifi was not working at first but a call to  the support help desk fixed that in about 3 minutes. There are good gas grills for everyone's use and someone else cleans them every morning. Our unit had alarm clocks , a cordless phone, and a good V.Sasoon hairdryer. Water pressure was decent and we never ran out of hot water. People can all be getting  ready at once without water temperature changing on your back. Beds were comfortable. Full sized washer and dryer came in handy. One review noted partying by locals at the pool on the weekends but we did not notice that. We did have 2 permanent families living next to our unit  so not all units are for swhort term  rent. Staff was friendly. We enjoyed DVD rentals and the pool. Went to the hula shows at the nearby upscale shopping center. There is a hiking/jogging path which leads  to the beach (seemed pretty far to me, but I'm lazy- like, you wouldn't want to get started with your kids and expect to just stroll to the beach). We saw a lot of sporty people of all ages enjoying jogs or shuffles in some cases along the path. Housekeeping was pretty hit or miss-- one day she/he didn't clean any of the glass tables or mirrors, and one day they forgot coffee packets. So I started leaving a note: take out garbage, leave extra coffee and 2 boxes of laundry detergent, please clean glass table tops--   and then it was all done. The price is good for the amount of space and facilities, especially compared to a hotel room, if you have a family.  Kahului beach (public beach) (by the Four Seasons nearby) is something to see-- sea turtles sun themselves on the sand!

This is a gated community with key code and we noticed there that there were differences in the condos, naturally, as they are owned by different owners and small touches may vary.  

Unit 1003 was a lovely 2 bedroom, 2 1/2 bath unit with a lovely lanai on the main floor and an even better balcony in the upstairs bedroom.   The unit is HUGE!  and more than enough room for 2 people.  It would be perfect for a family of 4 although there is room enough for 6 people to stay, in my opinion.

More than enough towels were provided in each bathroom, as well as toiletries.  The kitchen had a small bottle of palmolive, and a brand new sponge wrapped up so you may handwash dishes.  I especially liked this part as nobody wants to use a used dish sponge!     The kitchen was fully stocked with cutlery, silverware, plates, mugs, glasses, etc, and the nice thing was everything was matching! 

The swimming pool and hot tub were used by us twice and it was seldom crowded, never more than 6 people at a time there.  

You get 1 parking space, and some spaces are reserved, and some units you do get to use the garage.  There was never any problem with parking.  

It is a quiet community and you won't hear any loud partying here.  Also golf course is right there for you if you are into golfing. 

Some CONS........(this part may be a bit gross)

1.  the condo is large and MORE than enough room for 2 people (yay!!!).   but it's safe to assume that it would be time consuming and inefficient for the housekeeping service to adequately clean and disinfect the both floors of the unit, especially the restroom.

2.  the master bathroom was not cleaned completely.  on the undersurface of the toilet seat there was visible evidence that the previous guest had diarrhea.   there was crusting and spotting and lots of evidence of splashing.   granted there was some white foaming cleaning fluid in the bowl itself, the bowl was not scrubbed.  

3.  the hinges of the toilet seat are designed in a way where there are tight junctions along the side.  I bought a large bottle of bleach and a spray bottle and completely sprayed down and disinfected the toilet.  As I sprayed the hinges of the toilet seat, a trail of dark brown fluid trickled down from the hinges, indicating that the toilet hinges were a spot to trap old fecal matter.  ick.  I had the same problem with the condo in buidling #13 last year as well

4.  the air conditioning was pre-set at 74 degrees and you had no option to set the thermostat any lower.  This may be ok for the average person, but I get too HOT !   so since this was a 2 story condo with high ceilings, it felt quit warm and sweaty for me.  

5.  the shower floor was discolored.  I sprayed it down with bleach and water and dark stained water rinsed off.  ick !  

6.  pillows on the master bed smelled like ""old man greasy hair"" and fortunately each unit has a washer dryer and so I stripped the pillows and washed them in extra hot water (powdered detergent was available) and put them in the dryer for extended period of time.  

7.  best thing to do when staying in a large condo is to bring some latex disposable gloves, clorox disinfecting wipes, bleach, spray bottle, and do the disinfecting yourself.   also bring some disposable shower caps (you can buy them at the dollar store) and wrap each remote control in the shower cap and tie closed.  The remote control is the single most bacteria laden thing in any hotel or condo, so wrap it up!   You could also use the ice bag from the ice bucket or plastic wrap if there is any from the kitchen

Overall we would stay here again for sure.  
I just wouldn't assume that the unit was cleaned adequately and take some of the cleaning into your own hands !!!!","Date of stay: January 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Although there are a couple of shopping areas within the surrounding resorts, the whole Wailoloa complex of resorts is 20 miles from Kona and beaches for snorkeling were a distance to travel.  The grounds were lovely and there are 2 pools with BBQ grills.  Our 3 bedroom unit was spacious and comfortable and although the kitchen was well equipped, the blender was a piece of junk, there were no spices etc. of any kind, and they were ""out of large garbage bags"" so we had to try and use tiny disposable bags for kitchen garbage and that was a joke.  We were supposed to have a TV in living room and all bedrooms but there were only TVs in the living room and master bedroom.  The beds were comfortable but the 2 guest bedrooms were very small and the dressers in the 2 guest bedrooms were a joke.  They looked nice, but were cheap to say the least.  The drawers would stick and at one point in time we absolutely could not get the top drawer open.  After working with it for so long, one handle came off leaving it a REAL challenge.  We finally got it opened and removed the clothes and crammed everything in the other 2 drawers, which opened somewhat better than the top drawer.  The master bedroom was lovely, large and had a walk-in closet and huge bathroom.  The carpet throughout was in need of some good cleaning.  There was some snorkel and beach gear in the unit but not enough so had to rent snorkel gear.  Beach/pool towels available in the unit and a nice washer/dryer upstairs but not enough washing soap for the week (but then there never is.)

And you know, generally, what tends to happen is that, after a few times, the charm wears off. Well, that wasn't our case. We (2 adults + 1 child) still absolutely loved it . Think of it:
- awesome location (25 minutes from the Kona airport, 15 minutes from Hapuna, 5 minutes from a mall, 2h from Hilo);
- incredible surroundings (oasis in a surreal lava field);
- beautiful weather (it's driest spot on the island);
- calm (we've never been bothered by anybody's noise);
- nice pools (clean, warm, never packed, ahh!);
- wonderful villas (spacious 2-story condos, clean, fully equipped) and the independence and freedom they give you;

We had a two bedroom condo with two full and one queen size bed. The condo is located in Waikoloa Resort about 25 min north of the kona airport and 45 min from kona itself. The resort area is beautiful and has two outdoor shopping malls in it. The condo is down the first right turn after the resort entrance. There are few obvious signs directing you to the condo. The beach is a good mile or so from the condo complex. Lots of mountain views and views of the golf course which run through the complex. The location is very windy. May be that's why hardly anyone was playing golf.  We are talking 15 to 25 mph gusts. May be more. The complex is gated and you need a code to get in. Late check in was easy. The owners left a key in an envelope in a box at the office. You get a code to the box.  Our condo was neat and clean. Some stains in the carpet. Looks like all condos are two story. Most have garages you cannot use. Parking is outside the unit. Beds were comfy. There was a sofa bed we did not use.   The kitchen was fully equipped but there were no spices or basic items like in some condos we rented. The washer and dryer were beneath the stairs and there were washing supplies. There was beach equipment including beach chairs and boogie boards. There were also ice coolers for outings. The condo provides beach towels. There was plenty of storage space in the condo. The only issue was that there was some mold in the showers but not enough to get upset over. There were some bugs in the downstairs bathroom. There was also a leak from upstairs to the kitchen but that was remedied after we complained. The tv was a box that needs to be updated to hi def. Overall a very good deal.

The condo itself was a nice size and had a pretty nice kitchen (which we used a lot). While generally a nice place it is definitely in need of a deep cleaning and could use some updates (no flat screen tvs, 80's style vertical blinds, etc.).

Our condo was conveniently located by the main rec. centre with the fitness room, pool area and BBQ's.  We couldn't have asked for better!  It is worth commenting that the fabulous service that we received from the Aston staff began prior to our landing on the Big Island.  A big 'thank you' to Jenny for being a wonderful ambassador on behalf of Aston.  The service she provided to us was fantastic and appreciated!!  The condo itself had a complete kitchen, laundry facilities, air conditioning and all the comforts of home.  Ours had two rooms and two full baths.  The master room had a king size bed.  It was a great place to unwind at the end of a long day of golf and sightseeing.  The condo complex is extremely well kept and secure.

Ours was managed by Outrigger, so I'm not sure how different this particular unit was compared to the others reviewed here.  But judging by the photos, ours was pretty much the same.  It was a spacious 2 bedroom unit that was nicely furnished.  I don't know what a ""normal"" rate is but we paid $189 per night which I thought was an absolute STEAL for this unit. Full kitchen, patio etc.   The master suite was upstairs, which I would've preferred to be on the lower level.  But having a 2 level place made for a nice, dramatic open 2 story living room.   It was a bit of a drag to have to go up and down the stairs all vacation, though.  The pool area was nice, although we spent most of our time in the hot tub as the pool was chilly (even for a Minnesotan!).  I am learning that pools in Hawaii are generally NOT heated!  The location of the units was pretty good.  A long walk to do much.  I preferred to drive with my 3 and 5 year old kids.  But my in laws often walked to the shops, etc.  The shops provide a few decent choices for restaurants and shopping - although groceries here are EXPENSIVE!!  $10 for milk! $7 for a loaf of bread!  Drive into Kona and got to Target or Costco.   Being in Waikoloa as opposed to Kona was a great choice for us since we either spent time at our own pool, or drove to Hapuna or Mauna Kea beaches, which were both about a 10 minute drive away.    Overall, the only reason I didn't give this property a 5 was because the pool was cold, the master suite was upstairs and I don't give 5's out easily!","Date of stay: March 2012","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

The condo was located on the 15th fairway - we found 7 golf balls ...that was fun. The condo was a 3 bedroom/2.5 Bath that could sleep 7 people easily! We were only 2 so had plenty of room.

The condo had its own washer /dryer which is always a plus. Plenty of towels too. Cleaning service was excellent.
Only ""complaint"" I had was that the sprinklers ran (loudly) every night @ 2:00 a.m.! So we could not sleep with the windows opened but closed with The a/c running. I know that is minor but we like to sleeps its fresh air.

However, after spending a week on right  the beach in Maui, we found staying in this resort on the Big Island like moving back to suburbia.

The resort is on a golf course, however the way the units are laid out, most do not have any sort of view.
It is about a mile from the local beach, so not within walking distance and there are other beaches in the area to explore.

The villa is well laid out with a master suite on the upper floor and a second bedroom on the main.  Great for sharing with family or even a 2nd couple.  Open layout with two storey windows.  Plenty of room.  Unfortunately, the way these units are laid out, most units do not have great views.  You get 2 lanais with your unit, but most look out onto the parking areas and are not really that private.  I would have thought they could have had more units over looking the adjacent golf course.  The front office staff are helpful and friendly.  Great tips on sites to visit and restaurants.  The property includes two pools with free wifi at the clubhouse.  The fitness centre is sparse, but good running routes outside your door.  The maintenance crews do a great job keeping the gardens and facilities in tip top shape.  The Waikoloa area is a bit quiet if you are looking for nightlife, but there are some great restaurants with Roy's Waikoloa and a Tommy Bahamas restaurant nearby.  Local companies offer motorcycle or good quality road cycling available for rent.  You should know that this property is not on the beach.  You really do need a car when you stay here.  We enjoyed our stay.  The big island is probably what Maui was 20 or so years ago, a little more laid back with more space to get away on your own.

The exterior property was beautiful. Location was great. But this particular unit (#701) was very dated, beds and furniture all very uncomfortable, carpet was horrible. The kitchen was not very well equipped... there were many things we could have used in the kitchen like measuring spoons, measuring cups, scissors, etc. Also, a coffee maker from this century would have been nice. Didn't like that the master was up. Upstairs shower had no where to put shampoo, soap, razor, etc. We had to put it on the floor. Also, the shower pan & back of the toilet seat don't look like they have ever seen a scrub brush (disgusting). Last but not least, housekeeping had a terrible attitude.

Several days before I arrived I called to make sure of the room configuration that I had requested. I spoke to Desiree who was the most pleasant and helpful hotel / condo employee that I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with. Upon arrival I was treated very professionally and with the can- do attitude that you don't see anymore.  The property is a very nice , clean, spacious , secure and highly maintained inside and out.  I opted for a quiet unit, but in all honesty, the entire facility was quiet and peaceful.  You are right at the golf courses and have both the Queens marketplace and Kings shops literally 2 minutes away.  Before selecting the property, I had really considered the Hilton at Waikoloa Village.  I read the trip advisor reviews  which turned me off. The Colony Villas have free parking which is right outside of your room.  My wife and I walked over to the Hilton to see what all the hype was and I was so glad that I did not stay there. You pay for parking which is quiet a walk to the lobby.  When at the lobby, you take a monorail or a boat  in a canal to get  you to your room.  It is quiet a wait, not something that I wanted to do. While exiting the Hilton we heard an upset woman complaining at the check-in desk that she just arrived to her room and it smelled bad.  
The properties in this village are connected by a horseshoe shaped street.  The facility is about 20 minutes north of the airport.  There is a great beach with free public parking across from queens market place called A' bay. good snorkeling with turtles everywhere.  The Waikoloa Colony Villas is a great place to stay, a great value with an outstanding staff.  Desiree and Greg from Waikoloa Colony Villas were both outstanding people that made for a great stay.

After staying at the Aston Waikoloa Colony Villas for the last few days of our 10 day trip, we left asking ourselves why we spent so much time in Waikiki!  The Waikoloa Colony Villas offer beautiful grounds, pools, and very comfortable and roomy accommodations that feel like home - with the added bonus of the nearby beaches, really cool sea turtles and excellent snorkeling nearby, and golf and tennis right outside the door.  The grounds have nice pools with grilling facilities available.  There's also shopping and restaurants nearby, including the infamous ABC Store (in disguise by a different name at the Queen's Marketplace).

Our group of 3 couples was celebrating all the guys 50th birthdays. With 2100 Sq. Ft. we all had plenty of privacy. The kitchen was great, everything we needed. The patio off the living area was a nice place to get outside. The master bedroom & bath was very large with a very large walk in closet. The 2nd & 3rd bedrooms are very small, no chest of draws and no
televisions. This condo has queen beds in all the bedrooms. We loved that we were so close to the pool, hot tub and tennis court. We used the hot tub every night. The washer & dryer are very handy; all our laundry was done when we got home. The air conditioning thermostat prevents you form turning below 74 degrees. We opened all the windows and the breeze was great. We did not have access to the garage; parking was close and always available. There is a walking trail to the beach and Kings & Queens shop; it’s about a 7 minute. A little tricky to figure out and no lighting at night. Follow the signs to the petro glyph. Once you get to the Kings shops, cross the street and walk through the Marriott hotel lobby, out to the pool and on to the beach. We suggest the grand circle island tour, with Gray Lines. well worth it, it’s a big island, and the tour gives you a great overview of the island.

Booked the unit through Expedia a few days before we got there.  We were traveling with another couple and rented a 2 bedroom. We were all very happy with the place. Everything seemed nice and new. There were 2 levels. It was basically a town house so it felt like home.  We all felt we got great value for what we paid and left happy.  The pool area was nice and there was a little fitness room to help work off the holiday handles. Parking could be a little tight sometimes. You had to pay $10/day for internet and there was not a safe available for our unit so we had to carry our passports and valubles with us when we left.

Location of this place is ok, but nothing special. If you want any kind of beach time you'll have to drive somewhere else (I'd highly recommend Mauna Kea about ten minutes north).  If you've never been to Kona area, it is quite desolate. There is very little greenery and is mostly old lava rock. It's worth a trip over to Hilo or at least along the north end of the island where it turns tropical.  Not sure if it is typical, but it was really windy while we were here which kind of hampered our outdoor time and made it rather chilly in the evening.","Date of stay: March 2010","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Our flight arrived in the early evening, so be prepared in you plan in on checking-in after 6pm.  When we reserved this trip through Northwest World Vacations we weren’t given any information on how to check-in.  We were moderately confused on how to even access the property because of the gate and our lack of an entry code.  After figuring out how to contact someone from the management through the speaker box we were finally given access.
  
The unit was relatively new.  All three bedrooms were upstairs.  The master bedroom and bathroom were huge.  The room with two short twin beds was obviously designed for children and didn’t have a clock or a television in it.  There was another room with a queen bed and a bathroom in the hallway.  The sofa sleeper is actually more of an extended couch that could fit one person - no real bed, and there were no sheets for it.  There was a washer and dryer along with a travel size box of detergent.  We found beach sized towels in the linen closet as well.  It was a poor decision for the unit to be almost entirely carpeted.  The carpet was stained everywhere and it was pretty beat up.  The kitchen was fairly well stocked for the average family, with the exception of it lacking salt & pepper.  We cooked over 2/3rds of our meals here, so having a lot of equipment was important to us.  A word of advice - if you plan on making coffee, go out and buy jugs of water.  The tap water made our Kona coffee taste really off.

There was a nice lanai outside, but the table that could seat six could barley fit on the patio, which made it difficult to move around.  The place was very quiet and the landscaping was beautiful and well maintained.  There were a couple of grills on the property, but they get busy so plan ahead.  The night we decided to grill one of the grills was out of gas.  Another resident called the property and someone eventually came out and replaced the canister.  The property lighting is really bad and unsafe.  There aren’t really streetlights, which can make navigating the property difficult on foot or in a car.  Someone had attached a little LED light to the grill so that you could have just enough light to see what you were doing.  There was a nice pool and hot tub very close to our unit.  One night the hot tub would be really hot and then the next it was just lukewarm.  During our stay one unit decided to have a birthday pool party, so you may have to plan around that.  

The maid service was inconsistent.  Even though there was a sign in the bathrooms that said the sheets would be changed every three days, ours were never changed during our week stay.  Don’t expect someone to make your bed like in a hotel.  Our dirty towels were always taken, but not all of them were replaced every day.  One day we came home to a bag of trash in the upstairs hallway and a bunch of clean towels thrown on the ground, strange.  Some days we would get cleaning products like soap to do the dishes, but only on the last day were we given a dish rag and a dish towel.  Our dishwasher didn’t clean very well and it had some mechanical issues.  The bathroom was never cleaned, which was particularly problematic when you’re sharing bathrooms.  

The location can be a good thing or bad thing depending on what you plan to do during your visit.  The Waikoloa development is comprised of the Marriott, Hilton vacation rentals, and other condo units.  There is ocean access (not really a beach), and the Kings and Queens shops.  The Kings shops have really upscale shopping (Tiffany, Louis Vuitton, Macy’s, etc.) and a few restaurants, the Queens shops having a food court, an  expensive grocery store, and stores you could find in a mall.  The grocery store came in handy in certain situations; some of their items from their deli are reasonably priced (sandwiches, rotisserie chicken).  I’d suggest getting your groceries at the Safeway while in Kona, and be sure to sign up for their discount card!  The Macy’s was especially nice when I needed a replacement swimsuit for snorkeling.  If you plan on traveling the island, be prepared to drive a lot.  It’s a half hour to Kona, two-and-a-half hours to Hilo and the volcanoes, an hour to an hour-and-a-half to A Place of Refuge.  The southern half of the islands takes forever to travel since it has a 35mph limit and is comprised of winding and steep roads.

As you might figure out, most of the flights back to the mainland are red eyes.  We really wanted to snorkel our last day, but wanted to have access to our condo to shower and clean-up.  Check-out is normally noon, but after talking to the management we were able to stay until 6pm to $50.  Well worth it in our minds to have that extra time and resources.  Overall the place was really nice compared to other condos, just think about what you want to do on your stay before you pick your lodging.","Date of stay: January 2010","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

We had a great time. We got a 2 BR/2.5 BA unit with an aerobed. We booked it through South Kohala Management instead of though Aston and got a good rate ($177/nt, all taxes etc... incl.) but that included no housekeeping and no crib. We had to take out our own trash and wash our own towels (there were lots of towels in the room so that was no problem for us.) There are many beaches 5 to 20 minute drive to choose from.

The pools were excellent. One is more family friendly, the other more adult friendly. They are pretty strict about parking permits, but it wasn't a problem for us with our two cars. We were there during a slow week, so not all the units were full. 

It took some work to get the place moderately baby-proofed, so if you have a toddler, it might not be the best choice. We did manage fine though. Everything seemed pretty new an up-to-date, unlike some of the dumpy 70s era condos I've stayed in before. I think this complex was built in 2004.

The kitchen was well-stocked and we had a nice fairway view. The place was quiet and clean. Overall, we were very happy with our choice.","Date of stay: January 2010","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

They have two great pools. One for smaller children and a hot tub. We used the pool every night after dinner. When the guys went mountain biking and took the van there is a very nice on site taxi service which will take you anywhere in Waikoloa for a reasonable fee. My mom and I use this service to go to the king and queens shopping areas. then we used the little green trolly that take shoppers to the markets and hotels.

It was a lovely condo, roomy and comfortable.  We especially liked having a garage to leave our snorkel gear in so we didn't track too much sand.  The owners provided  boogie boards, beach chairs, mats, umbrella and 4 beach towels.  They also had some snorkel gear & toys, which we didn't use.  They had 2 sets of golf clubs, which was really nice.  The washer & dryer came in handy and I liked that they provided laundry detergent and dryer sheets.  The master bedroom & bath are upstairs with a huge closet.  There's another bedroom downstairs with a 2nd bathroom.  That worked well for our kids.  Our 2 boys had the bedroom and our daughter slept on the sofa sleeper.  The sofa sleeper was definately the weakest part of the condo.  The mattress is very thin and uncomfortable.  You can easily feel the bars in the frame through it.  I couldn't find bedding to fit it either.  There were 2 flat sheets in the living room hutch and that was all.  The 2 twin beds in the 2nd bedroom can be put together to make a king, so I used that bedding to make up the sofa sleeper.  It didn't fit, but it worked.  I felt bad that my daughter had such an uncomfortable bed for the whole week, but she didn't complain.
The kitchen was well stocked and we even made our Christmas dinner there.  We usually made breakfast there too, and found everything we needed.  The grounds are beautiful, the whole property felt safe and secure.  I got in the pool only once, it was very cold.  But who needs a pool when you have all those gorgeous beaches so close?  We tried to use the hot tub at the other end of the property one night, but it was too crowded.  Our end of the property was very quiet and we only heard our neighbors on the last morning we were there.  I think they had just arrived.  Our hosts were helpful when we had questions, the house nicely decorated and we loved the location.  We left temperatures below zero at home and were glad we had air conditioning so we could sleep at night.  I wouldn't want to stay in Hawaii without it.
Waikoloa is a great location if you want a base from which to see the island.  The beaches are superb.  It's not that far to Kona, and a nice drive to the north part of the island or through Waimea to Hilo.  We spent our last 3 nights in Volcano Village.  We sure missed this condo.  I would suggest spending only 1 or 2 nights on the east side.  We live in a dry area, so the humidity was pretty daunting in Volcano Village.  We didn't sleep well over there.","Date of stay: December 2009","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Checked on-line (on Tripadvisor actually) to read reviews, decided they were quite encouraging, and we gave it a go. So we're back on Tripadvisor to confirm: this place rocks. OK, it's not exactly cheap for our standards (we paid ~$270/night for a 2 bedroom condo, high season), but we absolutely loved it. As you will have read in other reviews, this place has its own style: it feels like an upscale home vacation rental much more than like a hotel. In fact, it is not a hotel. So if your style is that of people who want to be left in peace so you can do what you want when you want it, and r-e-l-a-x in a nice clean place, this might well be your dream spot, so do not miss it. Here is what we got:
- A nice, quiet, airy and spacious condo (given that you will spend 99% of your day time outdoors), furnished in a surprisingly decent style (it's after all just a hotel), on two levels, with the 2 bedrooms conveniently on the top floor, and the kitchen, counter + dining and living space on the bottom floor. You don’t have anybody living above, nor below your unit, so you get less/no noise from others, a huge difference with many other places.
- Add a terrasse, a balcony, 2.5 bathrooms (the one off the master bedroom is huge), ceiling fans, a modern washer and drier in the unit, TVs, DVD and video cassette player, audio system, internet access (which was OK, though not super fast and costs $40/week). The kitchen came with induction-stove top, oven, microwave, large fridge + freezer, toaster, blender, cooking utensils, cutlery, etc.
- we confirm: the garage wasn’t available for use. Woaa, what a biiiiig deal,  we had to park some 30 feet away...
- On the property, two nice swimming pools, bbq places, tennis court, gym, and really good looking landscaping.
- staff at the reception desk not outstandingly knowledgeable, but very nice and helpful.
- in the well kept Waikoloa Beach resort (has a whole bunch of other hotels), two shopping centers by no means cheap, but at least convenient . The malls include a grocery store and a few very decent restaurants (we highly recommend Sansei and Merriman if you're willing to spend ~$50/person wine, tax and tip included).
- miscellaneous: you’re at a ~10min drive from awsome beaches (ex: Hapuna), ~20min from the airport (but never heared a plane), ~40min from Kona, 2h30 from the volcano. You are seemingly in one of the dryest spots on Big Island, pretty darn nice in the “rainy” season (we didn’t see a drop in 7 days, and barely any cloud). Btw we do think (from experience) this place is perfectly OK with young children. In fact, there seemed to be mostly families (with kids ranging from toddlers to teens) at the time  we were there (school holidays). And we were never disturbed by any noise what so ever.","Date of stay: December 2009","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Booked package deal through Hawaiian airlines about 1-2 months ahead in advance and got a good deal for 5 at Kama'aina Rate. The colony villas allows you to check-in early but you need to call in at around 10am to check availability. The Villas are in a gated community so, use the intercom to contact the Check-In office. The Check-in office is literally at the left as soon as you drive in through the gates. We did pass the office and kept driving looking where to check-in because the representative on the intercom did not give any directions. The condos do have an individual garage for each unit but you cannot use them. I was told by the rep that it cannot be used and to park in stalls that do not say ""Reserve"". (I'd rather park in the garage if it could open because I'm paying for full use of the villa) Some of the doors were locked and unable to see what was in it. In one of the closets, we saw other peoples belongings as if the villa we had was a timeshare. Nice kitchen but found used cereal boxes and maple syrup, salt and pepper shakers in a top shelf as if the cleaners did not check and clean that. Air-con was nice and cool but you're strongly advised at check-in NOT to turn the temp no colder than 75 degrees. One person in our party is a smoker and smoking is strongly advised at check-in to smoke in designated areas (2 designated smoking areas only) If you are caught not in the smoking areas you are fined $50. If they suspect that you smoked in the villa, they will add an additional $450 fee which you have to sign a waiver for. Our guest room beds were very uncomfortable. Landscaping was beautiful and maintained. The Colony villas gives you access to an excerise room that's  located near the first pool (total 2 pools). Overall it was a beautiful getaway on a budget. I suggest that you ask lots of questions because they do not offer any suggestions which they DO have answers to.  DO NOT go grocery shopping at the Queen's Shop grocery store because it's pricey (go if you're desperate). If you're on a tight budget like we were but HAD to getaway, do your grocery shopping at Kona Sack & Save, Kona Foodland before making the drive to Waikoloa, or if you want to take a nice drive to beautiful Waimea before checking in, go to KTA Grocery store and do all your shopping needs there.","Date of stay: December 2009","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

They had spacious living room, large kitchen and a lovely dining room with colonial style table and chairs.
We spent most of the daytime outside playing golf, snorkeling and shopping but did most of the cooking in the unit. I do wish that they had more variety of dishes and bowls.

But it was worth the trip. The property has a very nice garden, with awesome plants and flowers. It has gates and therefore is never crowded. My villa was close to a comfortable open-air swimming pool. The atmosphere was always very pleasant and relaxed. Only the check-in procedure was a bit strange (the security had to make a call and we received a code to be used in the locking and then we had to go to the reception to get also the gate access code). The house was very large, furniture was clean and functional. The 2 ""lanai"" faced the golf course but in other villas they may face the internal road: ask for the golf course. Also, I am a jogger and every morning I could use either the internal road or the external (the one that goes to Kings shop place).
We had to pay for the internet connection.
I recommend it for medium or long term stays because, compared to a hotel, it offers more room, more intimacy and more independence, while guaranteeing daily cleaning and service. The presence of a fully-equipped kitchen makes it possible, when desired, to prepare meals at home rather than always eating out (for example, we always had breakfast at home, which we prefer by far).","Date of stay: September 2009","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

This place is GREAT for families, couples staying for a long amount of time (I could EASILY have stayed for a month or two in our condo).  We were so incredibly impressed.  The 1400+ square feet was bright and open, and allowed four adults enough space to keep from getting on each others nerves.  I would whole-heartedly recommend this place to ANYONE going in a group.  The pools were very nice (and warm!) at the colony villas.  The people were friendly as well.

Even before arriving to the Big Island, I had spoken to Desiree and she was a an absolute pleasure to talk to! She gave me great advise and emailed me directions on how to get to the resort seeing as we were supposed to get there after the office was closed.  Upon arriving to Kona airport it was about a 20-30 min drive (depending on how fast you can go or who you are stuck behind..haha) we did make it before the office closed and we were immediately welcomed and all our villa information was ready.  
We stayed in villa 1002.  It was gorgeous! We had 3 bedrooms and 2 1/2 baths(which was very handy as it was 7 adults staying there) living room, lanai on the ground floor off the living room, a small balacony off the master bedroom and a washer and dryer.  The kitchen was beautful with granite counter tops, nice cabinets and nice black appliances..

My only suggestion is that only the master bedroom had a television in it.  It would have been nice if the other 2 bedrooms had one as well.

Hands down i will stay again at the Colony Villas whenever i get the chance to go back to the Big Island. Thank you to the wonderful staff at the resort and to the owners of villa 1002!

This property is in a word...spectacular. It is a VERY nicely kept private golf course condo complex in a very affluent area. The Hilton and other big name properties are right across the street from this complex. Also, there is a huge gourmet market with LOTS of souvenirs within a 3 minute drive from door to parking space, so you can definitely buy all your liquids from the market and even get away with just bringing a carry-on on your next vacation to the Big Island! I LOVED the ABC store inside it, which is the same store that one would buy all their souvenir t-shirts, mugs and etc from.

There is a shopping center (King's marketplace) I think its called with big brand names and other higher end boutique stores right across the street as well. There are plenty of sit down restaurants, a Starbucks and even a food court with a pizza place that will deliver to your condo. Just be sure to order early, as things close pretty early there.

As for the property and staff, I would have to say that Desiree from the front office is one of the best in the business. She was very professional, helpful and just truly a pleasure to talk to. She assigned us to a 2-story unit that was right on the golf course and even though I don't golf, it was nice just to look at it :) You will always feel very safe, as I saw security in golf carts EVERY time I left to go get something from the store, which was A LOT. Coffee run, beer-run, food run, etc etc...They are VERY friendly as they ALWAYS waved to us with a smile. 

When I first entered the unit, I was very impressed with how new it looked and it reminded me of a model condo in South Orange County, CA where I live. The plasma tv in the downstairs living area and newer looking appliances sure made a great impression.  

However, once I went upstairs to my master suite, I could tell that the unit was a little outdated. The first sign was a small 20-25 inch old school box tv with a remote that was missing the battery cover. When I entered the bathroom and saw the old school small square tiles, I could immediately tell the true age of the unit. Nonetheless, the unit was nice overall, but very small touches could be made to help keep the ""upscale"" image that it deserves.

There is a very nice little balcony with enough room to sit with a friend and sip on a maitai and look out onto the golf course...I thought it was a nice feature...oh! another nice feature was the washer and dryer we had right in the unit!

When I finally decided to retire for the night, I found that housekeeping failed to provide a cover sheet to protect me from the mattress. Specifically, it was the sheet that goes over the mattress. It was about 2 inches short and my head and pillow would both touch the bare mattress thats been there for who knows how long. Being that it was the first night, I tried to fix it and forget about it. Unfortunately, the second time housekeeping made the bed, the top part was made perfectly and now the bottom part of the mattress was exposed. This time, it wasn't just a few inches, now it was about a foot or two of exposed mattress...lol

Later in the night, my door opened for no reason and I continually tried to close it. Turns out, the latch and door was not catching, so I ultimately had to put my suitcase in front of it...lol...it was quite entertaining at this point. My friends who were downstairs heard me trying to close the door all night and finally told me that their downstairs bathroom door did the same thing...I am thinking it was the earthquake they had a few years ago that caused the damage.

I then started to look around the room and noticed spider webs over the lamp right next to the bed etc etc etc. At this point, I just turned the lights off and we went to sleep. There was nothing to do but to laugh it off because we couldn't call the front desk to complain because this is not a hotel with 24/7 service.

Before staying at this property, you need to understand that you are renting a condo. This is NOT a hotel with hotel services. This means that there is no service staff or housekeeping after regular business hours. There is no on-demand tv or room service. If you can live with that, you will have a very nice stay, which I knew full well prior to arriving. I made the mistake of not checking to see if my bed was properly made before housekeeping went home :)

We went to the pool and jacuzzi area and it was very nice. Be sure to get some pool towels during business hours. The jacuzzi was hot and the pool was great...we had a great time.

The complex was always clean and the security was always nice. During business hours, I was able to talk with Desiree without any delays...

This complex is not too far from the airport. I think it was maybe a 20-30 minute drive depending on how fast you drive. If you're from Southern CA, you will probably want to kill yourself the 1st night because of how slow people drive. You're in Hawaii, you're on vacation...slow down...lol...be warned that the police drive unmarked normal old cars as police cars, so watch out! 

In closing, I just want to say that this property is VERY nice and I would definitely stay there again and without hesitation. The location is great if you like to be away from the crowds and downtown party scene. This place is great for a romantic getaway, a family vacation or a nice non-rowdy group of friends. 

As for the mishap with housekeeping not wanting to make the bed properly, Scott Fuchigami, the general manager of the property personally apologized to me and also offered me a free stay at any of Aston collection the next time I return to the islands. Scott was very understanding and apologetic over the incident and I could tell that he was very sincere when talking to me. Because of that, I will return to this property in the future without hesitation.

I plan on going to Maui next and taking Scott up on his offer. So please look for my next review from a property in Maui!","Date of stay: February 2009","Trip type: Traveled with friends","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Would Highly recommend!","The complex is gated, giving you a feeling of security from the moment you arrive. Desiree, in the very clean front office, was very personable and friendly. She answered all of our questions about check-in; advised us about the locations of the pools, barbecues, nearest grocery store (Island Gourmet), food court  and restaurants. We loved our 2 bdrm, 2 ba condo which was surrounded by lush landscaping, manicured lawns and clean sidewalks and which felt like a home-away-from home.  The unit  was huge as other reviewers have described, with all of the necessary cookware and appliances one could wish for. I am a planner (overly-so sometimes, haha) so I did research the locations of the local Costco (off Hina-Lani Street) and WalMart (off Henry Street) and made stops at both places before driving the 40 minutes or so from Kailua-Kona to Waikoloa (directions to both stores will be provided to you upon check-in.) We ended up purchasing bottled water, soda, meat (for barbecuing on one of the 4 or 5 gas grills near the pool areas), rice, paper towels and small paper plates (we wanted to have some non-breakable dishes to carry around if we went out by the pool. ) All of these can be purchased at the Island Gourmet (sort of a Bristol Farms/ABC Store combined) but at significantly higher prices than in the Kailua-Kona area. If you don't want to face the traffic to/from town, there is also a grocery store in Waikoloa Village (go back to Hwy 19, head a few minutes north, turn right on Waikoloa Road past the Blue Hawaiian Helicopters and drive about 15 to 20 minutes to the Waikoloa Highlands Center.)

We had originally planned our visit as a golfing trip with some friends, but our friends ended up having business conflicts and did not join us. Even so, our family had a great time. Our teen girls appreciated having a bedroom and bathroom to themselves, hubby was still able to golf (the driving range for the King's Course is walking distance from the complex), and great beaches (Anaeho'omalu or A-Bay and Hapuna) were just minutes away.

Other tips: if you go early in the day, you can find parking at the Mauna Kea resort and take a short walk down to a very nice public beach.

Bring beach socks or water shoes, since the Big Island beaches have a lot of lava rock. 

To get to the Colony Villas, take Hwy 19 north from Kailua-Kona airport to Waikoloa Beach Drive (you'll see two buildings that look like huts) and turn left. Take the first right which is Maintenance Road (you'll see a small sign before the turn) and follow it to the end. Make a LEFT and then an immediate RIGHT into the first driveway and you will see the gates of the complex. (If you turn right at the end of Maintenance Road you'll pass the driving range for the King's Course and the road will dead-end.)

We initially stayed in February for a concert that was scheduled at the Queen's Waikoloa Bowl.  There was another concert again in March which we had reservations for at another location.  We enjoyed our stay at the Colony Villas so much, that we cancelled our reservations at another condo and booked it at the Colony Villas instead.  We stayed in a 2 bedroom & a 3 bedroom villa, on separate events.  The rooms were spacious, clean and the kitchen had all the necessary items.  All we needed to was the food.  There were BBQ grills on the property to grill.  If you chose to eat out, no problem.  There were enough eatery at the shopping centers or the hotels.  As my children said, ""it's home away from home"".  

What I liked best was that on our second trip, there were more people staying at the villas then the first.   We did not have to worry about parking, because there were enough and the security was terrfic.  There would always be someone traveling on a golf cart to make sure all was well.  I did not hear a peep!!

It is not owned by a single entity and it is not managed like a resort.  We had the unfortunate luck to spend 10 days here which included two weekends.  During the week, it is relatively quiet, but on the weekends, locals crash the complex (seems iike half the island has the gate codes!) fill up the parking lots by the pool, use the facilities for hours- including the barbeques- then drive out late at night. 

This is what we witnessed while staying here:  a van of 10 people-including seven kids- park next to us, use the pool (kids screaming the whole time), then drive out; groups of teenagers driving in on Saturday night, partying at the pool, then leaving just before the ""closing"" hour; skateboarding and scooters; smoking and drinking at the pool; at least ten people hanging out in a condo next to us until late at night- all locals.  This is more like an apartment complex than a ""resort"".  Management is nowhere and totally non-responsive.  We never saw anyone other than the cleaners on golf carts.  In other words, if you are expecting resort attention, amenities and security, you can forget it- particularly the security part.  Might as well stay at a local apartment complex in your city for the weekend.

The pluses are nice units, a good location (which would be quiet if it were not for the use of the facilities on the weekends by people who do not stay here), and quick access to the Hilton and the Marriott.  There is a new shopping area- Queen's Marketplace-that has a food store and many shops.  We would stay in Waikoloa again but never at this complex.","Date of stay: September 2008","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_20"

It is not. ResortQuest is a property management company that manages several dozen condos that are owned by private individuals, which is part of a larger condo complex of 186 units. Waikoloa Colony Villas is run and managed by the Waikoloa Colony Villas owner’s association, and it manages the property, the pool, exercise room, the tennis court, and all the other facilities of the condos. Most of the units are owned by people who live there full or part-time. In other words, this is a residential community, not a resort. ResortQuest does not own the property, nor do they even manage the Waikoloa Colony Villas, they are essentially a marketing and property management company that has little stake in the Waikoloa Colony Villas, other than making money from renters.
Because this is a residential community, and not a vacation resort, if you decide to stay here, consider the following:
This is a good place to rent if your Hawaii-based vacation goals include:
--Essentially staying at the condos at night and spending most of you day away from the condos, visiting beaches and doing other activities during the day.
This is not a good place to stay if your Hawaii-based vacation goals include:
--Bringing the entire family, especially smaller children. There are no child facilities at Waikoloa Colony Villas.
--If your goal is to party, drink, and get crazy. This is because Waikoloa Colony Villas is a residential community and security will intervene if you break the rules. If this is your goal, then you should stay at a vacation resort that encourages such activity, such as the Waikoloa Beach Marriott or the Hilton Waikoloa Village, which are just down the street from the Waikoloa Colony Villas.
Also be aware that many individual owners rent their condos at the Waikoloa Colony Villas, often at a rate much less that what ResortQuest charges for the same unit. While ResortQuest might offer slightly better service than other renters, you will be paying a lot extra for this service.","Date of stay: August 2008","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

(If you arrive during the daytime and you're not too tired out, I would recommend you turn right and go a few miles down to Kileaua and turn left on ""Henry Street"" to Wal-Mart.   Buy your first groceries before heading out to the villa.   If you plan to visit the beaches, I would suggest buying cheap beach mats or chairs to take with you - and if you're fair-skinned, like me, a beach umbrella to protect you from too much sunshine is a good idea too!   We gave our chairs and umbrella away when we left!)

The surprise starts here - after driving for miles and miles of nothingness, you suddenly find yourself in a very sophisticated development.   (For sure, it's modern and similar in style to many an exclusive out of town development, but the landscaping and attention to detail has been very carefully and tastefully done!)

You drive through the development and Waikoloa Colony Villas is almost at the end of the development (about two miles from the traffic lights).   There is a short cut from those lights, but I'll let you find that out for yourself!

We had property number 1001.   We opened the door, took in the first suitcase and ...... WOW!   We stood, open-mouthed taking in the vast spacious interior, staircase and landing in awe!    ""Mahalo for Taking Off Your Shoes"" read the sign at the door, and looking at the spotless, welcoming, artistic interior, we could understand why.

The property had a large Queen Bed in the Master Bedroom with a full bath, full size shower cubicle and double washbasins en-suite.   A full size dressing room led off from the en-suite enabling our luggage to be stowed away out of sight!

The second bedroom was downstairs with its own double bed.   A bathroom with full size bath served this bedroom.    

In addition to the usual kitchen appliances, the property boasted a washer dryer - very useful when you're so far from home!

Hawaii Big Island is Big, (300 miles all around I'm told) so if you want to see the Rain Forest or the Volcano National Park, be prepared for a long drive!   You will need a car anyway, as the local shops don't sell much in the way of provisions and the nearest proper grocery shop is 6 miles away in Waikoloa village.

A-Bay is the nearest beach - pretty and a natural sun trap.   There are other beaches too easily accessed by car, and our favourite was by the Four Seasons development.   There is a canoe house built there and the locals are trying to encourage the wildlife back.   We saw turtles both on the beach and lazily swimming in the bay.

The houses are beautiful and the location is ideal if you want to chill out, relax, play golf or go out and explore Big Island.   Make no mistake though, if you like night-life and hustle and bustle, you are a bit out of it!   

Just chilling was our scene though!","Date of stay: July 2008","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We stayed at 306 and 1304 both were nicely funished and had a great location near the pool.  

Some advice:
- Avoid the condos with lanai's facing the pool they are not as private.  Request a golf course facing lanai.
- This is NOT walking distance to any swimable beach.  You will need a car unless you just plan on sitting by the pool.
- The condos have absolutely no staples of any kind included.  Not even salt and pepper!

Compared to most of the other complexes in Waikoloa, this would be considered very average.  They are two levels, which isn't very convenient if you have young children, or if you find it difficult carrying all of your luggage upstairs, as that is where the master bedroom is located.  The condo itself would be appropriate for families, as it is not nearly as upscale as the rest of Waikoloa.  The unit we stayed in had the most hard and uncomfortable bed we have ever slept on.  The walls were white and the carpet offwhite, so the decorating was not very exciting.  It does have a very small patio off the main level.  The barbecues for the complex are located either at the pools or there is one on the side of the street.  That happened to be located closest to where we were staying.  So not very tempting to stand on the street and barbecue.  
We looked at other complexes while we were there and found the prices for the others were very close to what we paid, and they were much nicer.  
Waikoloa is a wonderful resort area with shops, a beach, and beautiful environment.  So you do expect something better than the Colony Villa's had to offer.  
If you are staying in Waikoloa avoid Whaler's for buying groceries and go across the highway up to Waikoloa Village, about a 10 minute drive.  They have a very nice grocery store with great selection and the prices are much better.  Hapuna Beach is worth a visit.  And be sure to visit the Hilton Waikoloa.  You can enjoy an afternoon touring the grounds, even if you aren't a guest of the hotel.  It is beautiful.","Date of stay: October 2007","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_20"

Housekeeping came everyday to replace our towels, fix the bed, and take out the trash. There were paper towels, a new sponge, dish soap, shampoo, conditioner, soaps, and lotions provided, so we did not have to purchase those.  We just had to purchase food, which we did at Foodland in Waimea on the way back from our day trip to Hilo. The pool was very nice to swim in, especially with our 18 month old. There was a separated area for kids to swim in, which was just 1.5 feet deep, so our toddler was able to walk back and forth in the pool. The air conditioner worked wonderfully. The washer and dryer was a convenient plus (detergent was provided). Wireless internet was free, which allowed us to research our travel activities and stay in touch with things at home. You definitely need to rent a car when staying in this area; otherwise, you'll have to eat at the expensive restaurants at the nearby resorts and Kings Shops.

Towns are all 30 miles apart and be prepared to drive long distances. We stayed at a two bedroom unit for three days and had a decent experience.

Overall, the hardware of the house was great as these are probably the newest villas in Waikaloa. The appliances are new and are of above-average build. However, the pans provided were deformed and the non-stick layers were so scratched up it was very difficult to cook with them.

If you are accustomed to hotel-like service, look elsewhere. The friendliness and smiles on the faces of the staff has room for improvement, and don't expect housekeeping to be on call. You will only get your housekeeping every three days. (They do take out the trash and towels every day though)

We visited the beach at Hapuna Beach Prince Hotel and the Marriot and would probably choose to stay at either of the two if we were to go to Big Island again. The beaches are very clean with no smell of the ocean. Cleanest air we've breathed in a long time!

We had a great time thanks to the many tips received in these forums. We stayed at the Resort Quest Waikoloa Colony Villas. The Villas are fairly new and in good shape. The TV reception was terrible, but who needed TV. We appreciated the tip about Building 19. It was indeed away from any construction and it was really close to the big pool. We requested that building in our original booking and were pleased that it was honored. The Waikoloa resort area is a captive location and there are really very few options for reasonably priced meals, so we prepared almost all of our meals in the condo. The one meal we did eat out was at the Beach Grill Restaurant. The food was fine, but so expensive, $36 for an entre. We were disappointed with A Bay, the berm really restricts the usability of the beach and there is a lot of commercial activity traffic in the bay. On the other hand, Hapuna Beach was marvelous, great waves for boogie boarding, huge beach and lots of facilities. We enjoyed the snorkeling and abundant fish and turtles at Kahaluu Beach Park. Thanks for the recommendation for ""surfer bear"" (----------) and his surfing lessons there. There were just three students in the two hour lesson. We also had a great trip with Sunlight on the Water and saw lots of whales and spinner dolphins.
I was disappointed that a lot of the hotel web sites for the area weren't kept up to date, the Coast Grill at Hapuna Beach Prince Hotel advertised early bird specials that were no longer available,  Ocean Sports no longer offers windsurfing lessons or rentals, the Kings Shops no longer have their Tuesday night movies.
The weather was beautiful and we were sad to go home.","null","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

The condo was big, spacious, new, well equipped and excellent quality.  The main floor is an open concept with a small living room, large dining room, kitchen, laundry closet and full bath.  Up a long flight of stairs is a bedroom (kingsized bed), full bath with 2 sinks, separate bath and shower and walk in closet.  

The odd thing is we did not find it very comfortable or convenient here.  Our lanai looked out on a tiny strip of grass bordered by black volcano flow  that made us feel like we were in the middle of a construction site.  I think if you had a small child you would have to keep a close watch.   The pool  was some distance away (about a city block) and although we never did find the bar b q's we expect they were somewhere near the pool.  The resort area sits a fair ways out of Kona and one evening when we were tired and wanted dinner we realized it was unlikely anyone would deliver to our location, and we had a choice of fast food or a few restaraunts with long line ups at the local upscale shopping center.   We ate cerial that night.   The maid came early in the day and was rather lackluster in her cleaning and made a point of letting us know how inconvienient it was for her to come back later (i.e. in a half hour).   If I return to the big island we would look at other accomidations first.   There was little indicitive of Hawaii in staying at this condo however I think it would have excellent appeal to golfers.","Date of stay: February 2007","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

It is a short drive to some of the prettiest beaches in Hawaii. We stayed in a 3 bedroom condo which was perfect for the family. Lots of room and space to spread out.  Be sure to stock up at Costco by the airport before heading up to Waikoloa. There is no grocery store close to the condos, but I think there will be a grocery store being built in Waikoloa in the near future. The gas barbeque grills came in really handy for fixing a quick dinner.   The 2 pools on the property are small , but well maintained. 

The condo didn't seem that clean when we checked in and the maid comes every 3 days. I could have written my name in some of the dust that was on the dressers.  On the 3rd day of our stay, the maid came and left  clean towels and took the trash out. Not much of a cleaning.   There were some nasty looking stains on the carpet.

We did appreciate the late check-out on our last day. We had a red eye flight home and it helped to stay at the condo until 5 pm. It was just a $99.00 charge for the late check out. 

We would return to Colony Villas. Hopefully the cleaning issues will be addressed.","Date of stay: August 2006","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

It is on the dryer section of the island, not a lot of rain by Hawai'i standards, but it receives far less rain overall. It can get a bit windy there as well.

This property, ResortQuest Waikoloa Colony Villas was a bit removed from the center of the action of Kailua Kona area. I want to tell you it was so worth it! After a long day of sight seeing, shopping and snorkeling it was great to return to the relative peace and quiet this property offered. Speaking of peace and quiet, there is on-going construction near the property so if you book a condo make sure you request your condo be away from the construction. We only heard a very faint amount of noise and the dual glazed windows were most helpful in filtering the noise.

I would return to this property as it is a good value and excellent style of living for a low price. Note**The units are privately owned so furnishings vary from unit to unit.

The Waikoloa Colony Villas were built in 2003 up on the Kohala coast. A gated community which offers 1, 2, and 3 bedroom units for very little money. We had a 2 bedroom, 2 bath unit. It had a full kitchen as well as central air, dishwasher, blow dryer and laundry machines inside the unit. The property has 2 pools and one spa. Each unit is alloted 2 spaces for a car, just don't park in the ""reserved"" spaces and make sure your parking permit is visible.

The property has a tram (it costs $1) that runs every half hour which will take you up to the Waikoloa Hilton (a massive property which is like ""Disneyland"" boasting a monorail and boat ride. The tram also takes you to the ""Kings Shops"", a small, somewhat ""high end"" shops sprinkled with touristy gift shops and a Whaler's General Store. (note** if you need a grocery store there is one 6 miles away in the ""Waikoloa Village"")  You will also find a gas station located here as well.  

Make sure you get to see the Waikoloa petroglyphs right off the entrance of the Kings Shops.","null","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Being recently built, the facilities were very clean and in excellent condition, with comfortable beds, pleasant decor and great cooking area.  Landscaping was well maintained and the staff was friendly the few times we interacted.  During the course of the trip I walked through some other developments (Bay Club, Shores) and their buildings, pools and public areas were not as nice.

We stayed in Villa #2, next to the second pool.  We liked being so close to the pool, though a drawback is a 5-10 minute walk to the main pool for the spa and also to the tennis courts.  The gas grills at the pool were very convenient.  The construction was visible when driving in or out, but construction noise was nonexistant since we were on the golf course side.  

The location in Waikoloa is far enough away from the busy areas to be quiet, but it is an easy drive or walk to the Kings Shops, A-Bay beach, Hilton, etc.  There are several great beaches less than 15 minutes drive north.  Kona night life is 25-45 minutes south depending on traffic which can be awful, so ask the staff for the best times to go.  Do your shopping at Waikoloa Village 10 minutes away.","Date of stay: July 2006","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I can't argue with any of the previous reviews.  Our unit was clean and well equipped, with all the requisite appliances, granite countertops etc.  The grounds are nicely mainatined.  

My comment would be that we felt the place was rather soul-less.  The community is gated, and could be any condo development in suburban Anywhere USA.  You don't feel you are in Hawaii, and the units are not well designed to take advantage of the climate.  For example they have large two story windows in the living space, but these have to covered with shutters to keep the sun out.  It is more or less impossible to cool the units without the use of AC because the design does not facilitate cross ventilation.  Thick carpet on the floor is an unusual choice in this climate.  The feeling is one of looking ""inward"" rather than out to the surroundings.  All the features are what are expected in a modern suburban home, with the result that it feels like a modern suburban home, and not a special vacation place in Hawaii.  For some people that will be fine, for us, it was a bit disappointing.  We'll look for something more Hawaiian in future.

As for the construction, the whole Waikoloa area is experiencing large amounts of construction.  There is construction immediately behind the Villas, and it can get noisy during the day, and dusty at times.  It is sad that so much development is going on without much thought for good design, sustainability and the environment.

One final point.  These units are not very toddler friendly.  Besides the stairs to the upper level there are steps down to the living area.  Other hazrds include glass tables, a strange granite bar counter, patio furniture that traps legs and various other items.  Obviously some of  this is to be expected in any condo, but there seemed to be additional hazards here.","Date of stay: July 2006","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

The condo was very clean, spacious, and comfortable, and we would definitely recommend this place to other travelers- families, couples, you name it.  We were not golfers, however, and the only thing somewhat negative about this place is that it was a bit removed from the action...  our group was more into checking out the volcano and snorkeling, kayaking, etc., closer to Kona/Keahou.  However, there are some great beaches nearby (Hapuna was our favorite) and restaurants (we ate at the Coast Grille at the Hapuna Beach Prince Hotel for Valentines day- great by sunset!).

Great place to stay for families since villas include full kitchen,washer/dryer, at least two full baths and b-b-ques at pools and one near block 4 and 5. Buy food at Cosego or Safeway in Kona (30 minutes) or Waikoloa Village (10 minutes)
Construction was not a problem since they took a week break between Xmas and New Year. 
Arriving at night is a problem due to street lighting and office being closed. Day before arrival contact office for gate code, condo # and code to key box. Bring flashlight so that you can see ""condo block # signs"" (each block contains 6 condos). Note that Mapquest directions are wrong - last direction (#6)should read ""turn left at end of Maintenance Rd"" not ""turn right"". Google Map directions are correct. Also note that there is no Maintenance Rd sign on Waikoloa Beach Dr. Probably easier to continue on Waikoloa Beach Dr though the complete resort until you see the Waikoloa Colony Villas sign on your left.
Best restaurents for dinner are Roys at King Shop and Beach Grill at Beach Golf Course. Best lunch was at Kings Golf Course Grill.
Best beach (good waves) was at Hapuna State Park approximately 15 minutes north on #19. Beach is very busy and you should arrive between 9:00 and 10:00 to get a good parking spot.
All resort golf courses are expensive. The Waikoloa Beach Resort has two courses - Beach and King. Both cost $130 if you are resort guests. You have got to golf the Beach - fairways meandering through lava rock, waves crashing on lava rock and green at #12 with whales splashing in distance. Less expensive courses within 30 minutes but very interesting to golf are Makalei, Big Island and Waikoloa Village. Hints- if you are over 55 golf Makalei and Big Island on Thursday - senior days at 1/2 price ($50 to 55). Buy clothes at Hilo Hattie in Kona and receive discount sheet which includes two for one at the above courses (includes Beach and King after 12:00). 
Short cut for walking to King Shops from Colony Villas is along Kings Trail through lava rock between Colony Villa main entrance and Maintenance Rd - wear running shoes since this is the original mule/horse trail from Kona to settlements in north.

The villa was bi-level with the bedrooms on top.  We had our own washer/dryer and that was a big help.  The villa was clean, modern and tastefully furnished with a sea turtle motif.  Airconditioning worked well and ceiling fans were in all the rooms.  The kitchen had all the major appliances. We did see some very small brown bugs inside the dishwasher.  The bedrooms had lots of storage space and their own TVs with full cable channels.  The master bath had a separate shower and a fairly large tub (and I wished I could have had it at the next two locations we went to!).

We did not have time to use the pool, but it looked great and people were using the barbecues at poolside on some nights.  Didn't hear any noise, but Waikoloa is extremely windy, so we couldn't open the windows.

When you arrive at the front gate, dial the Resortquest/Aston number and they will buzz you thru.  The office will give you a parking tag with a dial code you use to get in the gate during your stay. We ate at Big Island Steakhouse in the King's Shops and had drinks at the Hilton next door.  All were quite expensive, but so is all of Hawaii.  Gas was $3.59/gallon!!

It's hard to believe you are only 2 min. away from all the shopping, restaurants, and beach but you are.  My husband, 18-month old daughter and I had a blast.  We would take walks on the grounds (next to golf course which was so green and peaceful) and hit the pool almost every day.  Both the kiddy pool and main pool (with waterfall coming down from the lava rocks) were large and never crowded.  If you are a pool person ask for a unit close by.  We had to drive to the pools as it was too warm and far for my toddler to walk.  The waikoloa beach next to the Marriots was very child friendly.  It provided shades from the palm trees and there were no big waves.  We went in the early morning and there were barely anyone around.  If you have time, also visit the Hapuna beach 10-15 min. north of the resort (by the Hapuna Prince resort).   The only downside of staying at the colony villa was the over-priced food/shopping.  The general grocery store at the resort was pricy and did not offer enough selections.  Restaurants were just ok except for Roy's at the Kingshops.  I would recommend going towards Kona and shop at the Safeway for groceries.","Date of stay: May 2005","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

First, I would like give my sincere apologies to my fellow passengers on Flight 257. The colony villas are located within the Waikoloa Beach Resort which is 18 miles north of the airport. It is a very easy drive on a two lane highway and the only two traffic lights you enounter are exiting the airport and turning into the Resort. A bit of warning...the initial right turn heading toward the Villas once inside the resort is not easy to see...especially at night (there are no street lights). The good thing is the entire resort is a circle and almost impossible to get lost. I had read an earlier review about problems getting into the gate. Im not sure if it was there before, but there are numbers to call at the gate to reach someone (Aston is listed). The villas themselves are well cared for and we did see landscapers there several times. They are a mix of private residences and vacation rentals. We did have maid service everyday and the service was excellent. Our unit was about 20 steps from the main pool and it was extremely quiet. Although the water was rather chilly (they dont heat most pools in Hawaii), but the hot tub was perfect. 

As for the resort itself, it was nice and the Kings Shops were an excellet place to walk around and have a nice dinner. Restaurant selections are somewhat limited, but downtown Kona is about 25 miles down the road. Another warning...if you have reservations at a Kona restaurant, make sure you give yourself plenty of extra time. Traffic (especially going into Kona between 4-6pm) can back up for several miles on the two lane highway. I would definitely recommend the Kona Inn Restaurant at sunset. All open and the tables closest to the water are incredible (be prepared for people surrounding your table taking pictures). 

A-bay is nice and the scenery incredible, but if you want a pure sand, boogie board beach...head to Hapuna. Its only a 15 minute drive and definitely worth it. Also if you like to snorkel, try Puako...great reef.

We golfed at the Waikoloa Beach Course and if you stay at the Villas you get a fairly decent discount. The course is nice and make sure you bring your camera for #12. 

All in all it was a great homey place with friendly people and great scenery.","Date of stay: March 2005","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

It was decorated in high style--very luxurious. We even had use of the attached garage.

The main problem was that our confirmation info did not tell us how to find the complex and get into the gated area. This proved to be a problem. First, we went to the wrong resort (directions were minimal). Once we found the right place, the office didn't answer the gate intercom, and we had to walk in. (Heaven knows what we would have done if it were after office hours.) Finally we got in and were given our keys. 

All this could have been avoided if they'd follow the policy of the next place we stayed, which was a private townhouse:
--Provide a gate code in the confirmation email
--Put the front door key in a lockbox, and provide the lockbox code in the same email
--Provide a 24-hour number of a local contact person in case of problems.

By the way, this entire resort is a self-contained ""city"" amid barren lava beds--fine if you like the artificial resort atmosphere, but otherwise rather constricting. It was near a good beach, though. We just were glad we didn't stay more than one night since the whole resort atmosphere is rather claustrophic--and prices for groceries, etc. are sky-high.

If you're going to stay on the coast, a better option is Kailua-Kona to the south, which has more going on and multiple options for lodging and dining.","Date of stay: February 2005","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_20"

It's located in the Kohala area, down the street from the Hilton and Marriott. It was quiet and has gated access, which you will receive when you check in. The decor of the condos made it feel like you were at home. 

Our unit was off the golf course and if you stepped outside you could usually see Maui in the distance. It was centrally located and had easy access to Hawi (45-50"" away) and Kona (25"" away). The beaches are beautiful, but the condos also had 2 beautiful pools which seldom had a lot of people. One of the pools has a separate ""kiddie"" pool that was shallow. Both pools were lined with tile and gorgeous. 

Word of warning - Do not eat at the Japanese restaurant in King's Court. Absolutely awful. We have better sushi in Oklahoma! The California rolls were made with imitation crab!

I believe Aston has two condo residences in the Kohola area. I never saw the Shores but the Aston Colony Villas were gorgeous, definitely worth the price.","null","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Our 2BR condo was huge.   It is obviously a very new development and all the fittings were of an excellent quality.  The bathroom for the master bedroom was as big as our child's bedroom at home.  All the furnishings were beautiful.  We had a lanai and a balcony overlooking the swimming pool.  With the morning sun coming in it was delightful to have breakfast whilst reading on the balcony.  

The swimming pool area was excellent with a nice little waterfall at one end and a couple of BBQ's available for use.    

I agree with the last reviewer in terms of maid service.  One day they didn't turn up and on the other days they didn't replace the towels in the bathroom, they were still lying on the floor, or make up the beds properly.   As we hadn't even been expecting a daily service this didn't fuss us but you would probably be a bit miffed if you were expecting daily servicing.

We were happy with the location and its accessibility.  One thing I hadn't realised from all the reviews I had read is that the resort is completely surrounded by old lava flows.  We were somewhat disconcerted as we drove up to Waikoloa wondering what on earth we would get, but once you are inside the resort it doesn't matter.  

One tip to possibly keep in mind is that you can buy a day pass ($80 for family of 4) to the Hilton and use all the outside facilities there.  Our children had been keen to stay there but we were not prepared to pay the price.  This way, we had tons of room in the condo and the kids got to spend one full day at the Hilton and try out all the various pools, see the dolphins, feed the turtles etc.","null","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I believe there is another Aston community in Waikoloa, so don't confuse them.

We stayed in a 3BR/2.5 bath condo. I think it is about 2100 sq ft (#505). The decor was BEAUTIFUL. The area was gorgeous. The facilities we well kept, clean and the office staff was courteous, helpful and friendly. There are 2 pools, one w/area for kids the other more adults and both fantastic. The entire complex was quiet and accessible to many areas. There was an earlier complaint from someone about it being far from Kona. I found it was only about 25 miles and that's nothing when you're from TX (ha, ha). The Hilton and Marriott are right down the street, but I loved the more home-like feel of the Villas.
I felt very centrally located. It was an easy drive to Waimea and Hawi. There are loads of beaches around, in fact the ""A-Bay"" is basically around the corner from the villas...beautiful w/Palm trees everywhere on the beach area if you don't want full sun.

We did buy food to fix breakfast on some mornings and the kitchen was large w/granite counter tops. There was an Open House at one of the 2BR/2 Ba units on the property while we were there, but our unit was so much nicer (decor), that I felt it did not compare (even though they were similar in layout and some decor features...tile in MBa and granite). 

The only negative would be the ""maid"" service. My sister slept on the pull out sofa, but when the maids made the bed, they never pushed the bed back in place. The maids only seemed to replace towels and incompletely make up the beds (MBR decorative pillows and shams were never put back on the beds, remained stacked ont he floor when beds were made). This was a minor complaint that did not make me downgrade the facility...but if you are picky about that sort of thing, you might want to mention it in the office if it happens.

I would highly recommend the Colony Villas to anyone who wants  a centrally-located, beautiful and peaceful facility on the western side of the Big Island.  Even though there are beaches, don't forget to visit the gorgeous pools.","Date of stay: January 2005","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

My husband, 8year old and I stayed here from 8/25-8/28 in the Malolo Beachfront Cottage. The staff was amazing and the villas was impeccably cleaned. Every morning we sat on our lanai with coffee to simply take in the breathtaking view. We ate lunch at Mamas once and also called and ordered take out, including a bottle of wine to enjoy in front of our villa. If I had one complaint it would be that we were regularly startled by people walking through the gate near our villa to get to the beach. While I understand that the beach is public, it would be great if people enter the beach on the side near the restaurant, instead of walking through the grass near the villas. Even that is not enough to keep us away from this amazing place. They even chill the glasses for you to have cold cocktails!  It is the little things. Mahalo.

Even as a small place not right on the beach it was well equipped and very comfortable, with beach chairs and towels provided, an outdoor patio and grill and small kitchen. Staff is helpful and friendly. If I had a complaint it would be that privacy is at a premium here-people needed to walk through our outdoor area to get to the parking lot and beach, and we had to keep shades down in the living area as anyone in the parking lot could have seen right in.

My jaw literally dropped when I walked in for the first time, & I wanted to cry!! From the time he made the reservation, at time of check-in, & even to check-out, this accommodation & the entire staff was 5-star all the way!! 
🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟

The unit was extremely clean & very cozy, tastefully decorated, very well appointed, & very romantic!! The bed, bedding, & pillows were heavenly!! We have never slept better away from home! The floor to ceiling curtains allowed for us to sleep in in the mornings; not to mention - the property is extremely quiet & peaceful!! 
There were more than enough bath towels, & they too were of the utmost quality & very luxurious. The unit had ceiling fans, & was air conditioned. The lighting throughout was very nice, & even had dimmers, which is great!! They even had a classic Marshall Stanmore player that we could connect our devices to through Bluetooth, & listen to our favorite music. The sound on that thing was fantastic!! 

The staff had placed freshly picked hibiscus & orchids all throughout the unit & accessorizing the towels; making it that much more special when we walked in, & throughout our stay! They literally thought of everything!! 

We enjoyed their delicious coffee in the mornings & homemade loaf of banana bread too. They even had a bag of ice in the freezer for us!! Like I said, they anticipated every need, & thought of everything!! 

We highly recommend The Inn at Mama’s Fish House; with our only regret being that we couldn’t stay longer!! We also didn’t have time to take a bath in the fabulous jetted tub, nor enjoy the spacious outdoor patio!! Next time I guess!! 

Mahalo nui loa for your most generous Ho’okipa & aloha!! We look so forward to our next stay with you all!!

The communication and service from beginning to end is and was top-notch. 

Our last visit (3/2021), I reserved a deluxe two-bedroom cottage for me, my husband and our daughter. The “Ono Cottage” was beautifully decorated and updated. It was situated on the bottom floor of a hale right behind the host station of the restaurant. Our gorgeous lanai and yard remained quiet and peaceful. (The only distraction was was the mouthwatering waft of Mama’s!) 

We loved being able to walk right out our lanai onto the lawn and the small beach. We set up a blanket on the sand and carried our beverages and snacks down for the afternoon. We watched surfers and kite boarders from afar. Sea turtles rested on the beach and rocks nearby. 

The Inn at Mama’s is a unique and wonderful place to stay for a few nights away from the resort areas. It’s also a good launching point for Upcountry or the Road to Hana. I would like to stay for a week! However, for most visitors, I think it’s a good place to get away from the resort areas for a few days.","Date of stay: March 2021","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We were there for our honeymoon and stayed in the Luxury Junior Suite (Jan 2021), one of their less expensive rooms, and I was blown away immediately upon opening the door. Honestly, the pictures on their website do not do the room justice!  It was filled with fresh flowers, and it was much more spacious than I imagined, with a beautiful private lanai, high ceilings, and a gorgeous huge bathroom with a whirlpool bathtub. It’s worth the room just for the bath!  We had an issue with the tub draining the first night, and management fixed it quickly the next day. Be aware that there is no staff at the office from 5pm- 8am, so you can’t expect assistance during those hours.  

The staff was super friendly and helpful, the grounds were lovely, and it was great to have a luxury stay away from the big resorts.  The beach in front of Mama’s is rocky and not great for laying out, but still excellent to dip your toes with your morning coffee (which you can make in your room).  We ate at the restaurant our last night there and it was simply incredible.  Well worth every penny, and we can’t wait to come back for an anniversary one day!","Date of stay: January 2021","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The lady working the front desk was very friendly. You could tell our cottage was recently renovated and it was very clean. It has a combined kitchen/dining/living room that has a full size refrigerator, table for 2, sofa bed, and TV. The kitchen cabinets were fully stocked. The other room had a bed and bathroom that had a walk in shower. The bathroom had shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, bar soap, and lotion. A nice touch was that each day fresh flowers were placed in the towels. We had 2 private patio areas with one connected to a laundry room. It had a washer/dryer and cabinets with beach chairs, boogie boards, snorkeling gear, and beach toys to use. They provided fruit, water, and delicious banana bread upon arrival. This was the perfect place to stay if you want to explore the island. It is conveniently located to the beginning of the road to Hana. 

There are two paths to access the small beach. One is through the waiting area of the restaurant and the other is hidden between houses. The hidden beach path is easier to find once already at the beach by using the path through the restaurant. It wasn’t necessarily a swimming beach, but nice to sit with your feet in the sand. It also is against the restaurant so many people used it as a backdrop for pictures. On our last day we drove a short distance to Spreckelsville Beach, which had we realized ahead of time would have been a great beach to relax at. 

Also make sure to eat at Mama’s Fish House! It was a dining experience that we will never forget. Food was delicious and our server, Dominic, helped make it one of the best meals.","Date of stay: June 2019","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We are educated people and would never touch anyone, hence requested we see the staff we had met the night before - which the hotel denied.

The washer dryer were attached to the back patio. The cottage was awesome. Very clean room, with a great full kitchen and bathroom.

People that worked at the Inn were very nice and accommodating.

Mama's Beach was an awesome place to watch the sunset. Hookipa Beach was very close, you can see sea turtles there and many windsurfers. We hopped from beach to beach within our stay because the location was so convenient. Our favorite was Baby Beach a 5 minute drive away.

If you plan to do the Road to Hana it's a perfect starting point. If you just want to hang out at beaches it's perfect. If you want to shop and eat in Paia also perfect.

It was all we had expected, and we would go again in a minute!  I did want to point out that Mamas is not in Paia, but a couple of miles from town along a very busy highway. For some reason I thought you could easy walk into Paia, and that's just not the case.  You can, however, walk around the lovely little neighborhood close to Mamas including over to a wonderful gourmet market where you can pick up fun treats and wine for a pre-dinner drink or breakfast on your patio back at the Inn.  The helpful Concierge will be glad to show you how to get from the Inn's front door onto the path that will take you through the neighborhood and to the market.  And be sure she points out the neighborhood access to Kuau Cove, the small beach right in front of Mamas.  You probably won't mind getting to the Cove by walking through the entry to the restaurant, but you may feel a bit disheveled coming back that way after swimming with the turtles and snorkeling.  That's when you'll be glad to know about the neighborhood access to the beach; it will lead you around the restaurant entrance and into the parking lot, avoiding all the beautiful people waiting for their tables.","Date of stay: July 2018","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

There was homemade banana bread and fresh fruit waiting for us on our arrival, and the cottage looked beautiful, decorated with flowers - although I wonder sometimes about the waste of beautiful fresh blossoms in Hawaiian hotel rooms!  With a high ceiling, overhead fan and the sea breeze, there was no need to use the air conditioning.  Guests have free use of a washing machine and dryer at the back of the cottage, as well as various beach essentials like snorkels and masks.

This is my seventh trip to Maui but the first time ever staying at the Inn at Mama’s Fish House and I couldn’t have been happier with my choice. 

The cottage is rustic, quaint and charming and blends in perfectly with the natural surroundings. And all the little touches were so special...beautiful flower arrangements adorning the home, a welcome basket of goodies to get the next day started (including a fresh loaf of banana bread, apple bananas, papaya and coffee), a beach chair and snorkel gear. 
The kitchen is also equipped with everything that you would need though I only used it for simple breakfast preparations and for warming up left overs. 

Staying here allowed me the opportunity to wander and discover this breathtaking part of the island at a leisurely and relaxed pace, or just sit back and inhale the sweet fresh air.  Each morning, I would rise early, before even the crack of dawn, pour myself a coffee and sit in the little private garden and revel in the sounds of silence. As dawn would break, the birds would chant in all their glory, welcoming in the day. 

While not ocean front, the garden cottage is just a hop, skip and a jump from the beach, where I would lounge, sometimes fleeting in and out of sleep to the waves crashing against the shore. A true oasis.

And of course, there is the convenience of Mama’s Fish House, where I was fortunate to dine one night. 

Everything about my stay was picture perfect and the truth is, I didn’t want to leave. I will definitely stay here again on future visits and perhaps even extend my stay.","Date of stay: April 2018","Trip type: Traveled solo","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

It offers a refreshing change from the usual hotel scene on the west side of Maui. Situated about 1 1/2 miles east of Paia town, it's a quick drive from the airport and well-located for people who want to visit Hookipa Beach, upcountry Maui or trek the road to Hana.

The Inn has a variety of rooms available, including a two-bedroom cottage right on the beach. We stayed in a quiet, spacious, well-appointed Junior Suite that had a private patio. A room of this type would have cost twice as much in Kaanapali.

As a bonus, the rooms at the Inn are just steps from Mama's Fish House restaurant, and the Inn's staff will be happy to make restaurant reservations for you when you book your room. Alternatively, there are some good restaurant choices in nearby Paia, Haiku and Makawao.","Date of stay: March 2018","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I am so glad that we did!  Any return visits to Maui will involve at least two nights at the Inn at Mama's. The garden cottage where we stayed had everything I needed, was completely clean, and made me feel entirely at home. With only one night we did not get to use the grill on the patio, but I love that it is available. A washer and dryer are available in an outbuilding close enough for easy access, but far enough away that they are not disturbing. I appreciated that the kitchen was stocked with little things like foil and zip baggies. If there was anything less than amazing, it was the shower.  The cottage was recently redone - doors, floors, cabinets, cabinet tops you name it - except for some elements in the bathroom. The bathroom is perfectly adequate, but it is noticeable that the tub and shower look a little older than the rest of the unit.  This should not dissuade a stay, it's only an observation to set expectations.  As other's have stated Mama's staff is amazing!  We were unable to access the cottage right at check-in time while Mama's staff addressed a maintenance issue; however, the staff took great care of us. The locale, the accommodation, the staff - all were fabulous!

Absolute Perfection","I wish we stayed here for more than one night! We stayed in the One Bedroom Garden Cottage.

My boyfriend and I stayed at 4 different hotels in our trip to Maui and Honolulu, and this is the only hotel that is getting 5 stars. It earned every one three times over. 

The service here is EXCEPTIONAL. The receptionists were so, so helpful - they answered all of our questions, gave terrific recommendations, and really went above and beyond. We asked one of the girls about how to get to the beach (other than the little cove in front of the restaurant), and she walked us right to the pathway to make sure we didn't get lost! She was chatty, friendly and pleasant, and we really appreciated this extra attention. We were also contacted by the hotel a few days before our stay to confirm arrival details and asking about a dinner reservation. This was VERY much appreciated, since I hadn't booked the restaurant yet, and I doubt we would have gotten a table if I left it to the last minute.

The room comes with literally everything you could want to make a stay in Paia perfect. There was a full kitchen with an ""honour bar"" (like a minibar) with pops in the fridge and snacks on the counter. Everything we needed or would have wanted was already there. Frosted glasses were already in the freezer, just waiting for cool drinks! As soon as I saw those, I knew that this hotel had thought of every little detail.

We asked where to rent snorkel gear - turns out it came with our room! The equipment in our room was kid-sized, so the staff went and found a set in my size. We checked out early (boyfriend went kite boarding and I drove south to snorkel) and the receptionists were kind enough to let us keep the snorkel equipment until later in the afternoon. The room also came with on-site laundry, as well as boogie boards, a big cooler, and beach chairs. The shampoo/conditioner/body lotion is super luxe - much better than the usual stuff you find in hotel rooms, which you're just as likely to leave behind. The garden patio is private and secluded - perfect for an early morning coffee to sit with your partner, relax and plan your day.

The flowers (both in the room and at the restaurant) are absolutely stunning. They are breathtaking and add a real sense of luxury to otherwise quiet comfort. I would describe the room as cozy-luxe - the decor is more cottage-like than modern chic, and the bathroom/kitchen furnishings aren't the type of glitzy white marble like you'd see at a fancy schmancy resort, but the service and comfort here are second to none. I could not think of anything that would improve the perfect seaside cottage experience.

If I could plan my trip all over again, I would book at least 2 nights here. This gem of a hotel flies under the radar (we discovered it only by accident while looking up info about the restaurant!) but it is 100% worth the stay.","Date of stay: January 2018","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

With only two nights, I decided after staying on the beaches of Maui for almost a month that I wanted to stay somewhere a little different. 

I chose the least expensive Garden Studio cottage and had no real idea of what I was getting, except that it  was close to the airport, which I wanted.

The Inn at Mamas has various accommodations they offer, from 2 bedroom beach front houses to my little garden studio. 

I was pleasantly surprised to see I had my own barbeque and a little grassy sitting area that was all my own to use.   The cottage from the outside looked small but when I got inside, it was heavenly.   A totally renovated suite with beautiful flooring, quality decor and more than enough room for a couple of people, much less just myself.  
In the small kitchen, there was a welcome basket of fruit and a home-made banana loaf, along with fresh flowers.

Even though I was only there for two nights, the bed was made up and fresh flowers were tucked into fresh linens, alongside a complimentary newspaper, during my stay.
The staff were very efficient and friendly, especially Shiree, who showed me my suite.

I made a reservation for dinner at Mamas and although it is incredibly pricy, the meal was delicious and the Lilikoi creme brulee was so yummy I almost ordered a second one.  I was seated at one of their best tables, facing the ocean, and I was totally entertained watching all the surfers and kiteboarders  while I dined.

The beach here is very small and only good for wading into.....but it offers excellent turtle watching as they seem to enjoy being in the protected little cove right in front of the restaurant.   You could see the track of one turtle on the beach:  it must have come out of the water onto the beach during the night to rest. To stand on the shore and watch several turtles only 10 feet away from where I was standing was magic. Several kids on the beach were enthralled with seeing turtles so close.

  This little Inn would be a good place to stay if you want to be close to the airport, Paia town or are planning on heading up to Haleakala or to Hana. It is also great for anyone looking for a unique place to stay.

I would stay at this Inn again:  it offered some unique things that a regular beachfront condo does not.  Great service, friendly staff, and as a woman travelling solo, I felt totally safe here.","Date of stay: April 2017","Trip type: Traveled solo","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

It's very ordinary and that is NOT a negative. 

The cottage we stayed in was a one bedroom garden view. It had both a front deck with grill and a back deck with a garden. Both were completely private. The house itself was spacious and clean with a completely furnished kitchen. The wifi is lightning fast and Netflix is on the TV. 

Best of all it's a stones throw  away from the best restaurant in the islands.

Below us, is another apartment. They had a terrace that gave them a wonderful view towards the palm trees and the sea. We had a large veranda above the apartment below which gave us a nice view to the sea and the grounds of Mama's Fish House. There is some grass around the apartments but the best part is the beautiful sand. 10 steps and you have your toes in the sand and then out to the Ocean! The water is very clear. I could have stayed in the sand and water for the whole time. However, we hired a tour guide to see the island. He came and pick us up. We went to a few places to swim and diving off of cliffs. The kids did it, wasn't for me! The man was not only following his plans but he was very good to change coarse. The sensory was unbelievable! He picked Papaya & Apple Bananas for us. They were great. We went to see where Charles Lindbergh was buried and the lovely little church. It was a special place. We went to see a black beach also. While we were there someone climbed up a huge straight stone. A guy swam out to the stone, claimed up and then jumped off the stone. WOW! Seeing the other side of the island is very different from the Mama's side of the island. If possible, take some extra time for that side.

The cottage was rather quaint with comfy chairs, a spacious bathroom, plenty of storage, washing machine and clothes dryer in a room out the back, also great air conditioning which we needed on some days. We could park our car right outside our cottage which felt very secure; some of our friends had to park a little further from their cottages. 
It was well worth paying the extra for the deluxe cottage. Our friends were in more basic cottages, albeit still very nice but with shared outdoor area with another cottage, or with an uncovered outdoor area which we didn't use because of the weather, and one of our friends had no dishwasher which is a little disappointing when you're on holiday. One of our friends stayed in a beachfront cottage, lovely to be able to see the beach but we liked the privacy and quaintness of our deluxe cottage better.

The cottages were serviced daily by delightful ladies who came bearing flowers to adorn our bathroom.

The location was fabulous with our gorgeous little beach out front of mamas. We enjoyed a delicious meal at Mama's with guest discount. The only downside to the location is that you need a car to get around as it's so busy along Hana highway that it is not safe to walk along it. You can get to one general store via a stairway behind the cottages and up through the back street, but that's about it.

We were a group of windsurfing families; we stayed at Mama's for 9 nights and enjoyed a regular routine of sightseeing in the morning before heading to either Kanaha beach or Sugar Cove for the afternoon. We loved Paia; it's a gorgeous little town with such a relaxed vibe. There's plenty of interesting shops to look at and we loved the chooks wandering around everywhere.
We took a drive down south to where all the tourists were and found the beaches so overcrowded. We were relieved to head back to our laid back Paia.
We would highly recommend this very special place.","Date of stay: June 2016","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

It was recommended to me by a friend who has traveled extensively as have I. We were not able to get an evening reservation as I didn't call until 5 days before I planned to dine here. That was a blessing as they serve the same menus for dinner or lunch. Plus the scenery during the daylight is nothing but spectacular. It is strategically located and built on the wonderful beaches of Maui. Everything about the food, service and atmosphere is amazing. When I go back to Maui it will be my first reservation I make well in advance. It also was a great place to dine at the end of a great drive on the road to Hana. When in Maui you must try this place.

The staff was super friendly and the studio was spacious and clean.  There was a dedicated parking spot right in front.  No ocean views, but close to the beach in front of Mama's.  
My original plan was to get up early & drive to Hana, but instead I just went to Ho'okipa beach which was close by.  I was by myself and felt safe.  Both nights, I walked over to Mama's and sat at the bar and had a great time.  For me, this was a little bit of a splurge (hence only 2 nights) before heading out to a timeshare in Honowai.  Paia is close by with restaurants & coffee shops.  When I went, there was a discount for Inn guests at the fish house, but my bartender told me that was being eliminated.  (too bad - even a small discount helps at Mama's)  In this unit, the bathroom is right off the kitchen, which struck me as a bit odd.  And be careful, in the kitchen there are a lot of goodies - but if you consume, there is a charge.  It was not immediately obvious to me that was the case....  But there is a complimentary fruit basket with banana bread - YUM!

There is a small outdoor area with a grill.  A very pleasant area.  There is a laundry & room with beach going stuff, like chairs.","Date of stay: June 2016","Trip type: Traveled solo","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

One of the grounds keepers helped us find our room (we weren't part of the checkin where the detailed information was given) and explained some of the beautiful flowers around our cabana. Everyone has wonderful customer service skills.
Once in our rooms we enjoyed the hibiscus flowers spread around the rooms on towels. The service personnel kept our cabana immaculate, and of course decorated with hibiscus flowers on the towels every day.
Tide pool by the Inn at Mamas fish house offers great turtle viewing. We filmed four that were swimming around the pool each day.

Since our flight from L.A. didn't arrive until early evening, we decided to splurge and spend the almost $800 for a single night in one of the Inn's beachfront cottages so we could rest before driving the two+ hours to our week-long accommodations in Hana.  Upon check-in, we were delighted to learn that, while my spouse and I didn't need the space, we'd been upgraded from a one-bedroom to a two-bedroom (fully furnished) cottage.  The ""cottage"" was located on the ground floor of a two-floor building.  The place was terrific and very comfortable -- perfect for relaxing into our vacation and adjusting to the Hawaii time difference (three hours behind PDT). We enjoyed a tremendously good meal in the restaurant and turned in around 11:00 p.m. Then we were awakened at 4:45 a.m. by the guest above us who literally stomped around the tissue-thin floors for an hour+ (we could also hear every move he made in his bathroom).  It became impossible to tune the extraordinary clomping and slamming of furniture/luggage around and we finally just got up (still exhausted from work and travel) and started the day.  When we checked out, I mentioned our deeply unsatisfactory experience to the young women in the office.  They were polite, offering a thinly voiced apology and a promise to speak to management about it -- but in the moment, there was no offer to make up for the inconvenience and aggravation the noisy upstairs neighbor had caused us.  It's a full week later and we have yet to hear anything from them.  If we had been in a Motel-6, I would have kept completely quiet.  But we had just blown almost $800 on the room and didn't get to sleep or enjoy our privacy.  We certainly didn't expect a refund, but any minor gesture on management's part (a voucher for a couple of drinks at the restaurant?) toward compensating us for the lost sleep and consternation would have gone a great distance in quelling our negative feelings.  We believe that any established/more recognized hotel would have offered some little recompense so that we wouldn't walk away from them with the thoroughly negative experience coloring the entire event.  So if you're looking for quiet and the grace of a good night's sleep, don't accept a ground floor dwelling in this place -- or avoid the hotel all together if you expect the expense of staying there to be fully reflected in the service provided.","Date of stay: July 2016","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_10"

Obviously it's adjacent to Mama's Fish House, a mediocre restaurant. KIDDING! This is the third year we've spent the last night or two on our trips to Maui. This year, we were recognized for a milestone anniversary at both the Inn and at the restaurant. This place is a class act. Each time we've stayed here, we've stayed in the Ahi Suite. It's more like a resort than a hotel room. The Ahi has a huge open area with a king bed, sitting area, kitchenette and a huge bathroom with a walk-in shower, tub and double sinks. 
A few specifics that I think are very important to note. The bed and bedding are AMAZING. The attention to detail is commendable. The fixtures, beautiful. I don't care how old a place is as long as it's clean. This place has amazing details and is among the cleanest establishments we have stayed at. 
The staff at the Inn and the restaurant are incredible. Polite, helpful and always owning smiles. If this joint was on the water, it'd cost a fortune. It's a short distance to downtown Paia and that's a treat all in it's own.

Mama's is really close to the airport (15 min) and we checked into a two bedroom ocean facing room --- Malolo -- bedrooms are simple but with comfortable beds and pillows (1 King 1 Queen), one shared bathroom, the kitchen is totally equipped, everything is new, a spacious TV/living area and fantastic outdoor deck with seating for six people.

The dinning area for the restaurant is very close but you don't hear much notice, surprisingly, but your beach view will have restaurant guest walking past but they didn't bother us at all. Kids loved the beach but it's limited swimming but great to play on. 

The hotel staff are very friendly but it's not a full service hotel with concierge. In fact I found this a little disappointing when I asked about dinning in Paia and was told ""every place is good"".  That said, when we asked for a table at Mama's Fish House they turned a table around with an hour --- and we got 15% discount on the final bill for being hotel guests --- really appreciated this.

My only negative was that for $850 it's expensive for what you get --- its 20% overpriced in my opinion --- hence the 4 vs 5 stars but it's only the price/value I feel was off. 

I'd come back, I'd recommend this to other and I'd eat at Mama's again for sure.","Date of stay: March 2016","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Her direction were right on (very dark [no street lights] the 7 miles from airport to Mama's). PAIA which is 1+ miles from Mama's everyone gone to bed.

Our cottage ""ULUA"" was near the Lodge Office like she said with a big sign on the patio gate. The garden patio looked interesting & the key was in a locked box next to the front. door.

We could not believe what we found inside a wonderful fully equipped kitchen, big dining room table, great living room (with everything) a large bed room with a great king bed, etc.  The bath room had lot of hot water & flowers ever where (it is small). The furniture was in excellent shape & you felt like you were back in old Hawaii (first time to Hawaii 1956).

After a great night sleep we found bananas, papaya, a small loaf of bread & 100% Kona coffee for our breakfast. We  eat breakfast in our very private patio with wonderful plants, flowers, birds, etc.  We also found outside a BBQ, Washer/ dryer, beach chairs, & diving gear, etc. (all included in the room price)!! PAIA has a good market & places to shop & the ""Fish Market is outstanding for ""L"" or ""D"".

The grounds of MAMA's Inn & Restaurant were a wonder to explore. They have their own small sandy cove & lots of palm trees & lawn. Down from them are two large sandy beaches to ride the wave if one wants. Walking the little side street from Mama's is interesting with several ways to the beach/rocky shore line.

We loved our cottage for it was like old Hawaii & we could hide out in the patio & hear the birds, etc.  We only stayed two nights; it should have been 3 or more (you get a better rate 3+ nights.)

quiet and lovely and is swimmable if there's not high waves or storm.  There are restaurants in the nearby town but the parking there is terrible and I heard we were there in low season.

The atmosphere of this location was so serene.  We stayed in the Lehi cottage.  All the beach amenities you could want were included such as boogie boards, noodles, chairs etc.  The proximity to Baldwin Beach was a definite bonus. This was a great spot for exploring Kula/upcountry, Haleakala, and Hana.  What a terrific location! The kitchenette included a range top which we did not use.  However we made a lot of use out of having a fridge and fishes.  There is a grill to use in the courtyard of this cottage.

The down side of the always exceptional experiences at Mama's Fish House has been the drive back to Kaanapali. This time we decided to book an overnight stay at The Inn at Mama's Fish House so we could fully enjoy our meal and not worry about having a bottle of wine to enhance the experience. An added bonus of being a guest at the Inn is that you get a discount at the restaurant. 
We arrived early afternoon to a warm Aloha welcome at the Inn and were shown to our one-bedroom cottage. The cottage had been recently renovated - the result was beautiful! We immediately regretted that we hadn't booked a longer stay. There were hibiscus blossoms everywhere including a splash of blooms surrounding the kissing swan towel sculpture on the bed. The refrigerator, microwave and dishwasher are all high-end; and the kitchen is fully equipped with all the amenities of home. A thoughtful welcome gift of a basket of fresh fruit and banana bread made on site was very much appreciated.  There is a beautifully landscaped private patio off the bedroom with its own water feature. In front of the cottage is another enclosed patio with a barbecue, a table and four chairs - it too has been imaginatively landscaped. The decor is tasteful throughout and furnished with a Hawaiian flair. The bathroom  is spacious with a large marble - tiled shower and high-end fixtures. The bedroom has a luxurious king bed that is as comfortable as any luxury hotel bed.
All in all The Inn at Mama's Fish House far exceeded all our expectations. We are looking forward  to a return stay on our next visit to Maui.","Date of stay: September 2015","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Fresh flowers, every day! Hibiscus tucked into the towels. A beautifully appointed kitchenette that can be disguised when not in use.

Beach chairs, coolers, boogie boards, snorkels, anything you can think of. The little beach on the property, while public, is protected by a reef to allow for swimming, and is a lovely spot with a perfect view of the West Maui mountains.

The only reason I didn't give Mama's Inn five stars ... we weren't told consistent information about when the 15% discount at the restaurant could be applied.  In the end, it was explained that the discount is only good for the nights you stay there, but we were originally told they would apply it any time during our stay on Maui.  (We stayed in Kapalua for two weeks before arriving to Mama's Inn and ate at the restaurant once during those first two weeks.)  Also, they wouldn't apply the discount the evening we checked out, and that was disappointing because we had intended to eat there before going to the airport late that same night.

The Cabin we stayed in was both quaint and comfortable.  It had all the modern amenities, but every you could still see and feel that this all had been here a long long time.  The service was top notch, including the fruit and snack bowl and other extras made available. Dinner at Mama's Fish House was fabulous, to say the least.  The service was excellent and the food and drinks were to die for! 
Our visit has a bit of a story to it.  We had stayed in an Inn in Hana the night before.  A sleepless night with a fan that barely worked and a bed that was uncomfortable.  Then we hiked up to the last falls at Oheo Gulch (Seven Sacred Pools).  By the time we were done with the hike it was raining pretty hard.It was sundown.  We were triumphant in conquering the trail (we are in our 60's) and hungry.  The only place open was the same place we found open in the evening in Hana time time of the year, a small resort with a kitchen. Good food, but we wanted another choice.  We were supposed to be at Mama's Fish House Inn to check in by 5:00.  There is no cell phone service on that side of the island.....so there was no check-in and there were no restaurants around, either.  We picked up a hot dog at the little Market and headed out on the Hana Highway.  If you have never been on The Road To Hana  you have an exciting and beautiful beyond belief experience  ahead of you!  In the daytime!!!!  At night and in the rain it was like a 3 hour roller coaster ride in the dark and in the rain.  It is not so much up and down as it was the 35 to 40 hairpin curves ending in one lane bridges.    We made it through, then when we got close enough to civilization again, my daughter calls from Seattle to say the Mams's fish house was calling to see where we were.  She told them we were coming back from Hana and the lady understood.  She waited for us in the office (which closes at 5:30) until we arrived at 8:00 and graciously showed us to our rooms and get us a reservation at the Fish House in 15 minutes.

We were last here 9 years ago for dinner (first time Poki!) and noticed the cabanas near the beach next door which looked inviting. 

Rather than treat ourselves $350+ for a beach side unit we booked one of the lower-priced Garden Suites, since we were going to get plenty of beach-front in Hana later in the vacation. We were upgraded to a two-bedroom unit with full kitchen - we needed a fridge to hold all our food for the upcoming week - which was very nice of them. Very classy operation, great personnel and the room was clean and delightful. 

The reason for the mere 3 stars is that there is no ""garden"" around at all. The unit is part of a duplex with walls all around it. The result was somewhat claustrophobic for us - we were expecting a little of Hawaii's green lushness with the sound of the surf in the distance. Also, the actual beach is nice but a very narrow piece of property and fairly crowded with gawkers and folks waiting for their table at the restaurant. If you are expecting some beach-chair action watching the surf with a good book, this might not be the place for you. This property is close in toward Paia and oceanfront is tightly controlled and walled off here. 

Of course, one of the main reasons for staying here - as it was for us - is the immediate proximity of Mama's Fish House restaurant, which is always a treat and arguably the best place to eat on the island.","Date of stay: November 2014","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

I noticed that there were movies you could borrow from the office, but the only reason I could think you would ever need that is if you had to stay in your room sick.  The bed was Amazingly soft and the closest to what I have at home out of anywhere I've ever stayed before.

The furniture is not overly fancy and it looks so 'outdated' but in reality it's very relaxed and more of a 'Hawai'ian"" experience than you'll get at any of the 'fancier' resorts on Maui. The papaya and lime along with fresh banana bread was a great welcoming gift that we had for breakfast every morning in our suite. The kitchen had everything we needed (utensils, blender, barware, plates, bowls, can opener, toaster, etc). The a/c was nice and quiet, as well as nice and cooling. The TV was perfect! The washing machine and dryer came in handy, as well (who knew)? The wild birds around the place were truly amazing and sooo colorful. Housekeeping was great, as well as the beautiful women at reception. All so friendly! Of course, the food at the restaurant was just sooo outstanding (especially the banana colada's with dark rum). I could stay for months on end at this little jewel just outside of Paia-- but back to Wailea we had to go for the last week on Maui.

And after you've done the big hotel thing, and feel comfortable getting around the island, finding your niche and hitting the spots you know you like, you want a peaceful place to stay that helps you feel more like a local than a tourist. The Inn at Mama's Fish House is exactly that kind of place. 

We tired quickly of overt, over friendly and forced hospitality, which unfortunately is a lot of what you get at the resorts. The comfortable yet well attended to villas and apartments located on the Mama's Fish House ""compound"" allows you to sink into local Maui life totally seamlessly. 

We arrived tired and found fruit, banana bread and waters in our unit, plus a note from manager Lisa saying ""Welcome back!"". Waking up to the chirping minah birds, smelling the plumeria and hibiscus that surrounded our little fenced in (totally private!) yard, and just being able to hear the surf in the Kuau Cove a few hundred yards away was like wakening in another world. It was perfect. 

Needless to say, having the ""backdoor"" entrance to the best restaurant in Hawaii—in your backyard—is an amazing perk. We felt like total insiders, and spoiled ourselves delving deep into the amazing menu of fish from all over the globe, reading about the local fishermen (and women!) who caught them, and even appreciate their well-curated wine list. but the real treat.... after dinner, a stroll in the moonlight back to the cove and, unlike the rest of the visitors there, a quick stroll back to our villa! What a treat. 

Now that we've discovered makawao, haiku, and of course Paia is just 5 minutes down the road for great dining, shopping (mana foods is great!) and people watching, we wouldn't stay anywhere else on Maui. I recommend highly.","Date of stay: April 2014","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The staff was outstanding, even by Aloha standards, and that is saying a LOT. 

Our first night, which was actually late January last year, we booked one of the least expensive rooms, a Studio, as we just needed 1 night before heading to Hana for 4 nights. I really didn't know what to expect, and our room was quite huge, looked like it had perhaps been the 2 car garage of a house in a former life, with the rest of the house turned into another cottage or studio. I don't say this as a negative, as it was furnished very comfortably with island style, fresh flowers in numerous locations throughout, including blossoms on the bath towels. There was a lovely welcome basket with tropical fruit and really yummy banana bread. Very nice touch! Bathroom of our studio was teeny as was the kitchenette, but very functional & cute. 

Our last night on Maui, we needed 1 night somewhere after checking out of our TS at MMOC in Ka'anapali before flying home the next day, so we splurged and got a Jr Suite. WOW. GORGEOUS. Seriously, fabulous! It was very private, had a really large courtyard and lanai with table and chairs. Huge, posh King bed and living area inside, with an enormous and very luxurious bathroom, having a separate oversized tub and walk in shower. The artwork in this suite was amazing! A beautiful wooden carved statue of sea life, paintings, etc. In both rooms we had very nice toiletries that are locally made and lovely.

The office staff could not have been nicer and helped us with dining reservations for both nights. And don't forget you do get a nice little discount on meals at Mama's Fish House with your reservations here. Yay! 

I think what sets the Inn at Mama's Fish House apart is that each unit is completely different in every way from the other, and they have a big variety of sizes and prices to choose from. Also, the attention to details in the rooms is well above what is normally seen, from the welcome basket of goodies to the flowers, etc. Would I stay here again?

No you aren't on a beach of any significance & no there is no pool (personally that is a bonus - as I don't like to use ""public"" pools).  The beach however is sufficient to cool off and the next beach up the road has surf, snorkelling and turtles.  The restaurant dosen't pretend to be a cheap holiday option - it is a world class fish restaurant and charges accordingly, but you don't have to eat there and the guide in the room in absolute fariness informs visitors of all nearby options - alternatively get fab supplies from Paia and cook your own.  I would advise against staying with children but it would be fine for small groups of friends & extended family as ther are several options though limited in the number for other rooms.  You will need a car - but if you are seriously trying to explore Maui without one well good luck.  Overall genuine 5 star accomodation of the studio appartment style with easy access to a 1-2 star Michelin Restaurant - only La Mere offers better sea food in my experience in Hawaii and its pricing is on a whole other level.","Date of stay: October 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

If you want a sandy beach you must be on the Kihei/Wailua/Lahaina side but then your island experience will be very different.  This side feels like Hawaii and your drive to Makawao and Haleakala are pretty easy up Baldwin Ave...Although Paia is getting pretty busy

We stayed in the Lehi Room which is a cottage. It has it's own entrance and small yard with beautiful flowering vegetation everywhere. Access to laundry and beach chairs is located in a shed in the yard. The room was very cool and decorated in Hawaiian accents. The bed was comfortable and the bedding was clean and lush. There was a small kitchen with all the basics. The bathroom wasn't in the best shape, but it was certainly clean and the toiletries were very nice and the towels were fresh and fluffy. There were fresh flowers everywhere! Folded into the towels and on the bedding. We were greeted with a lovely breakfast tray with fresh fruit and banana bread. Wifi is free. Checking in and out was simple. Everyone was friendly and accommodating.

They are doing renovations there, so it might be a bit confusing to find the office to check in at first but people are friendly and will help navigate you.

I'm not sure I would stay here for a longer duration, but it was a good choice for one or two nights, if you want to spend time in Paia.

The Restaurant atmosphere was great! there is not a single space left unfilled with very interesting artifacts. It's like the Restaurant itself was built out of these things. Before dinner we walked the grounds and took pictures. Sat on the beach. Watched the sunset. Then we went for dinner. I had the Mahi Mahi and it was probably the best fish I have ever eaten. The Black Pearl was not just a dessert, it was a work of art! and delicious too. The drinks are very pricy. I had a sunrise and it was in a smallish Martini type of glass and it cost $20. I thought that was a bit ridiculous! It wasn't fantastic or anything. Our table, however, was perfect, looking out onto the grounds.

I want to say that as it was our 25th Anniversary, they gave us a nice card at the table and gave me a beautiful fresh flower lei, which I thought was a lovely and thoughtful gesture. This was not the most expensive restaurant we ate at. Fleetwoods actually cost more, but we did get appetizers and more drinks there. We did get a $25 credit at Mama's as overnight guests.

I'm glad I ate here as it was on my Maui bucket list. 

I loved staying in Paia. Paia is one of my favourite towns. Mana Foods store was very interesting! It was huge and it was so busy, I wondered how such a small town could have SO many products. People must come from all around to that place. 

We had breakfast at Charley's. The pancakes were huge and very good, with coconut syrup, which was interesting. The service was quick and fast. No waiting for a table. It was good value if you are looking for a quick breakfast before hitting the Road to Hana bright and early.","Date of stay: October 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

This was the first time we stayed here at Mama's but not the first time to eat here.  First, let me say that the beach is not for anyone expecting white sand and perfect sun.  This is no the leeward side of the island and as such the beach is much rockier than the tourist beaches found elsewhere on Maui.  That being said, it is very romantic in a classical sense, wind and water sculpted out cropings of lava with several ""pools"" near the beach to observe small sea critters.  The grounds lead from the restaurant to the waters edge, under palms.  When I read some of the bad reviews of this property I can see why the reviewers where not happy - they most likely where expecting perfect beaches and high end luxury accommodations.  The beach is wild, rocky and beautiful in an un-refined natural way.  The accommodations are very comfortable - think small condo / apartment - clean, (very clean as a matter of fact) each place has an outdoor washer and dryer - nice for sandy or dirty clothes.  The welcome basket has a small amount of local roasted coffee, some sweet bread (ours was a banana) and fruit.  The fridge in the kitchen had water stocked and some soda.  Keep in mind, you are there because of the restaurant and perhaps to make the drive to Hanna and back and not have to drive an extra hour plus to the resorts.  

As for the staff:  Fist, our check in and check out where handled with the utmost professional manner - the folks in the front office from the time I called to book my stay and all the way through - made my two days there very comfy indeed.  This is NOT in the middle of the luxury resort area - this is off the beaten path and quiet.  Our cabin/condo was right behind the restaurant and had it's own ""secret"" door to get to the restaurant and beach.  I parked the car for two days and had no regrets staying here.

THE FOOD:  Yes, it is pricey - YES it is worth every penny. Yes, it is the freshest seafood you will get.  NO - this not fast food.  NO - you will not get in and out in a hurry.  If that is your desire (to be in and out in a hurry) you need to find someplace else.  If on the other you are looking for a truly wonderful, fresh meal - you have found the best restaurant on the island.  The fish changes daily according to what the local fishermen bring in - you can not ask for a better experience.  

THE STAFF - The folks at the restaurant are wonderful.  Our waiter was very generous with his time and knowledge of both the fish, food and local area.  We were taken care of without it being overbearing. Each of the four meals we had here where of equal quality - each staff person we encountered had a very pleasant manner about them and where very helpful.  We really did not want to leave - as much as we enjoyed the rest of our vacation - Mama's remains one of our highlights.  It really is the quality of the staff that makes the difference.","Date of stay: March 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

We made mai tai's and wondered down to the beach on our first evening. There in lies the only problem we encountered, one has to go thru the restaurant reception area to and from the beach. The host was concerned that we were carrying drinks to and from the beach. I understand, but it seems this confusion needs correcting.

We were going to Hana and didn't want to make the drive right after flying in from San Francisco.  Mama's Fish House was on the itinerary for a special dinner, so we thought it would be convenient to just stay at the Inn our first night.  What a great idea!  I wish we were staying longer!
We were greeted warmly upon arrival and personally escorted to Ulua - our room.  Ulua had everything we could have imagined and more - open, light filled space with kitchen, living area, washer and dryer, a loft - plus we received fresh fruit, kona coffee and a loaf of delicious banana bread!  Our bed was so comfortable, we slept great!
If you have ever been to Mama's, you know that it sits on a beautiful beach.  Our room had beach chairs and towels so we were able to take in the fresh air after a stuffy plane ride.
Dinner could not have been more convenient as we could walk through a gate to enter Mama's restaurant.  If you have not been to Mama's you are missing out.  The menu changes daily and includes fresh caught fish complete with the names of the fisherman, boat and area it was caught!  Yum.  
The Inn at Mama's Fish House was the perfect spot for a special event, but we will be back again and plan on staying longer next time.

Buyer beware.","This is NOT paradise. It is not even acceptable. We checked into a ""cottage"" (Manini) which was a one bedroom unit in a duplex located in an alley behind Mama's restaurant. The place was clean, I will say that, but the pictures make it look much nicer than it is. The furnishings are very average and the location is horrible. No decent beach access and you're a good 2 miles from Paia, which is hardly walkable. The restaurant is the only thing nearby. There are no views and no beach access. The deal breaker was the thumping stereo from the next door neighbors. If Mama's billed their units as residential condos in an average Maui neighborhood, then fine. Charge accordingly. But don't try to pass the place off as an ""inn"" or some sort of quaint b & b because it's not.

Upon arrival, we felt as though we had just walked into paradise!!! The office staff were more than friendly, they were like family.  We were taken to our cottage that had a private gate and sitting area with  our own grill, washer, dryer, everything that we would find at home!  On our dining room table we found a tray filled with fruit, coffee and homemade banana bread! And in the kitchen, dining room and bathroom, there were fresh flowers tucked into the washrags and towels.  Each morning we received more fresh flowers.  The grounds are clean and gorgeous.  It is EXACTLY how we pictured Hawaii being. 

 The beach is small and gorgeous with breaking waves that soothe the soul.  And just down the street is a beautiful sight.  If you stand on the cliff around 4pm you will see huge waves rolling in with mist rising up into the sunlight.  I think that was one of my favorite scenes from this trip.  Out in the distance are the surfers and wind surfers which add to the delight of the view.

On our last night we ate at the restaurant and had the most delicious mahi mahi I have ever eaten.  The atmosphere and the food are well worth the money (we did receive a discount for being guests of the Inn)

We paid less per night than the fancier resorts in Wailea Beach and the stay was so much more wonderful with the personal touches.  It is a place for total relaxation.  The only thing that I missed was a pool.  Even though the beach is one of the best views around, it would have been nice to sit at a small pool relaxing.  

I would DEFINATELY stay here again if we return to Maui.","Date of stay: October 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The cottage style was very traditional with the nostalgic charm of old Hawaii.  The grounds are beautifully landscaped and their beach is one of the most picturesque settings on Maui.  The ocean there has a natural break water, so the beach shore is calm and friendly for young children to play on. 

We found this place to be absolutely beautiful... what really sets the Inn at Mama's Fish House above everywhere else, is their employees.

Mama's Fish House Restaurant is breathtakingly exquisite and the perfect place for special occasions or a first-class meal.  The prices are higher than other restaurants in the area, but the food quality, the friendly service and the ambiance is the finest.  Our dinner was the BEST meal that we have ever enjoyed on Maui.

The location is 10 minutes (most) from Kahilui (OGG) Airport on Maui.  Although central to every direction you could want to go in Maui, you are in one of the most beautiful Hawaiian setting imaginable with a lovely protected beach in front of you.  We were stunned when we turned the corner in the evening to find the restaurant (as always) very full and quite active.  We could not hear any of it from our room.  The rooms are tucked away just enough for you to enjoy the view, not hear or see the Fish House crowd and still enjoy a private beach setting.  We have eaten at the Fish House on prior trips but this was our first experience staying at the Inn.  Instead of staying in one place in Maui as we usually do we thought we would try several boutique hotels in more remote areas as we made our way around and through Maui.  Walking around the beach steps from your door at Sunrise with your just brewed coffee or rocking in the hammock listening to the waves was perfect!

The staff were all attentive.  All of the staff was kind, smiled and seemed to have the Aloha spirit.  Ashley when we checked-in showed us around and took the time to answer questions and make suggestions for our first evening in Hawaii after 12 hours of travel.  The room had lovely fruits on arrival and the inn uses local crafted soaps as a nice touch.  The flower arrangements in the rooms, yes in the rooms, were phenomenal tropical pieces of artwork.  Truly a lovely touch I have yet to encounter in any of the other hotels we traveled to in our 2 plus weeks.  We did stay in some higher end spots (""Preferred Hotel and Leading Hotel"") and never did we see flowers in our rooms - let alone like the ones here.  So we were in a downstairs unit with a family above us with very rowdy children.  The staff noticed the noise level from the screams and foot stomping and discreetly let the parents know.  We did not ask - they just did this because it was the right thing to do!  

No swimming pool, but the beach has a sand alcove great for smaller children.  You are also 5 minute from the town of Paia with Mana Foods, Flatbreads Pizza and whatever else you might need.  Yes, Paia has changed.  There is even a Dakine (I believe one of two in the world) store for those of you in need of surf gear.

Staying at the Inn, you must of course eat at the Fish House.  This dining experience was of course - as always - one of the best.  Yes, pricey, but worth it.","Date of stay: August 2012","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The room was very elegant with extremely high ceilings with beautiful floor to ceiling draperies.  The moldings were elegant with extraordinary panels that were reminiscent of old Hawaii.  The furnishings were of the best quality, as were all of the bath amenities.  There was a nice mini bar and kitchenette set up.

The suite had an enclosed patio which was nice in the morning.  The unit is about a two minute walk to the ocean.  The service in the room was minimal, meaning, towels and bedding were not replaced, nor were the rugs vacuumed during my stay.  Please note that once you find the unit (quite difficult at night), bring a flashlight as it is very hard to read the key pad that holds the key.  Also, park in the assigned spot designated for the cottage.

The biggest surprise came when I tried to make a reservation for dinner.  Guests do not seem to have a priority when it comes to seating times, however, there is a 15% discount for Inn guests.  Even with the discount, I found the prices were really over the top.  I have been a regular visitor to this restaurant for years, but this may be my last visit.

Makawao had some nice shopping which put me back a bit between galleries and pictures bought but we spent some decent money on the stores there.  The Suite was nice.  I liked having a fully enclosed patio.  We had a junior suite I believe and thought it was very well done.  I like this room more than the view we had at the Sheraton.

The staff is wonderful and anticipates needs you had not even thought of...welcome gift of homemade banana bread and fruit on our first day, full kitchen, beach towels and chairs, snorkeling equipment, gas grill, your own washer and dryer, etc.  The cottage is idyllic and immaculate and most importantly, conveys the feeling of living in Hawaii by the beach.  By the way, as other reviewers have mentioned, the beach area provides a spectacular view and while rocky, is great for snorkeling and is nestled next to a grove of palm trees...bring your camera.

I found Mama's in the back of my Maui Revealed guidebook under places to stay (Maui Revealed is a definite must have on your trip to Maui- it tells you all the great places to find hidden waterfalls, ratings of hotels and restaurants and all about great activities and adventures to do). The Inn at Mama's Fish House was one of the best things about Maui!! 

The Inn is located in the small unique town of Paia which has a cool little town to go shopping (I loved the galleries and local artist stores. Souvenirs are cheaper here in these local artist stores because they are away from the main tourist hubbub) and not to mention is located on its own tiny private beach (although the ocean has a lot of coral and rocks it was still your own little bit of paradise) and has the best restaurant on Maui on site!  

We had the Lehi or Garden Apartment which considered the studio but in my opinion it was much much larger and better than I could have ever imagined! First, you walk into an adorable little court yard which has gecko tiles and beautiful greenery as well as your very own grill and outdoor table. Also, in the the courtyard is a shed which houses everything you could ever think of but possible forgot to bring on vacation- beach chairs, snorkel equipment, etc.

As you walk into the apartment you are greeted by  wonderful Hawaiian decor on a big comfy bed, as well as a little living room and kitchen table. On our kitchen table we received a welcome package with the most delicious banana bread I have ever tasted, limes for drinks, bananas, a mango and more!! In our closets there were beach towels, and a flash light and extra linens which came in very handy for the sunrise on Mt. Haleakala (Which was beautiful but FREEZING). We then had three little steps where you could  walk into the full kitchen!! The kitchen also was stocked with everything you could possible need to cook meals- a definite plus that I will utilize next stay. The bathroom was a bit small but was beautifully decorated with fresh Plumeria tucked into all of the towels and on the shelves- it was a wonderful Hawaiian ALOHA!  

Ashley was wonderful from the office. She made us dinner reservations at their on site restaurant Mama's Fish House- definitely the best restaurant on Maui. She found out it was my birthday in passing and when we arrived to dinner we had a wonderful ocean view, a happy birthday card and received a free dessert which was delicious. Since we were staying at the hotel we also received 15% of our entire meal which was nice. Ashley also told us about a wonderful little beach where local surfers and wind surfers go about a mile down the road where we were able to see our very first sea turtle!! My husband was so excited- the turtle was on the beach and we were able to get a wonderful look at the beautiful creature!!

Our experience here was different from our resort experience but was so relaxing and wonderful! My husband and I wished we had spent more time here- next time we will extend our stay!!

After long days at the beach on the west and south sides of Maui, a drive to Mama's Fish House seemed far at the end of the day.  I approached the ""problem"" by booking a two bedroom cottage for the four of us, my husband, myself and two college age sons.  On entering Papio cottage, the first response from one of our sons was ""I could live here forever"".  The cottage was beautifully appointed with clean, tropical furnishings, fresh flowers and live plants, a full kitchen and a lovely, secluded garden patio complete with a table for six, a gas grill and a glider.  The beach, though rocky in places was calm, particularly compared to the ocean beyond.  It was a delight to sit under a palm tree and watch the wind surfers in the distance.  This is an ideal location for exploring the north and east sides of Maui, up country and Paia, or simply relaxing. How many days you spend here really depends upon your ""need for speed"".  It is a slower paced area but with several good restaurant choices, including Mama's which is at the top of our list.  The staff is very accommodating and you feel more like a guest in someone's home rather than merely a hotel guest.  The complimentary and very convenient laundry, beach chairs, videos, etc are a very nice touch, as is the fresh fruit and banana bread on the first day.","Date of stay: May 2012","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Two Small couches and flat screen TV,(who watches TV!!) and a dining table. Outside on Lani there was another table and four chairs and another wicker couch. You do need to bring your own coffee etc. as they give you a small packet for one day, and then there is a 19.00 charge if you choose to use the coffee from the honor bar. (mamas special brand) Resturant not open for breakfast, so you either need to stock up in your room or go into town. The problem that I did encounter, was upon arrival.  There is NO ONE to help with the luggage.  We were on the second floor (no elevators of course).  My husband is unable to help with luggage....so I had to lug, our luggage up the stairs by myself, and back down the stairs upon leaving.

I sent an email to the office, providing a specific sample of what i wanted printed out. Also, requested for a early check in. We arrived at the cottage by taxi and felt the aloha greeting once we walked into the office. The same woman i spoke with the day before, ashley greeted us and checked us into our cottage. I was blown away, she had exceeded my expectations. We opened the front door to find a variety of beautiful native flowers placed nicely on the floor leading up to a fruit tray with banana, payapa, coffee and mamas banana bread, she also printed out on a very nice placecard the special note for my husband that i had asked for assistance with.

Aloha Campers ( which I also recommend).  I wanted to clean up and eat well before we left for the airport the following day.
We stayed in the smallest room available, a cottage (Lehi?), which was HUGE! Full kitchen, beautiful bedroom and a small but nice bathroom.  I wasn't expecting this big of a room---HEAVEN!We were tired so we got a couple of DVD's from the office and ordered ""take out""  from Mama's.  The only thing you should be aware of is, they don't have ""room service""  so you can't take drinks or wine out of the hotel back to your room (we brought some from out camping trip).  Like I said- HEAVEN!!  Wonderful dinner on our own dining table, then off to bed to watch a movie.  It just doesn't get any better than that.
The next morning we woke up and took out coffee to the beach in front of the restaurant, sat in the sun, and watched the windsurfers and kitesurfers.  It was magical.  Lunch at the fish house again and then off to explore Paia.
The only problem we had was with transportation.  Since we had turned in our camper, we didn't want to rent a car for 22 hours, so we arrived at Mama's by taxi.  The Inn is on the outskirts of Paia and the only way to get into town is by cab---but the cabs are not real anxious to come and get you for a 5 minute ride into Paia.  The cabbie was complaining when he heard we were only going into Paia and kept saying that he wouldn't have come if he had known and that he would charge us at least $20----fine, I would pay a flat fee but don't complain about it.  I also think that the inn should have made some kind of arrangements for people like us.  
They did store our luggage so we could retrieve them on the return trip to the airport.

We stayed in the Ono cottage which is located in the lower level of one of their beach front cottages.  Right outside of our cottage was a hammock with a view of the ocean.  I spent much of our trip in that hammock.

I was a little hesitant to stay in the lower level, usually I think an upper-level unit is a better bet, but because the lower level units have direct beach access, in this case the lower level was the way to go.  It was wonderful to be able to walk right out of the living room to the beach. 

It is a little difficult to walk to Paia from here (no sidewalks), but when you are staying at a place this nice with direct beach access the goal is to stay put and relax (on the hammock right outside of your patio).

They were gracious in underscoring the need for dinner reservations, so we took the lead and booked sunset reservations for supper (thank goodness).  The inn was able to honor a same day request for an early check-in (because our other property was a 1030hrs check-out).  When we arrived, we were warmly greeted followed by my credit card run through one of those old school credit card machines....I knew we were in for a throwback experience.
Our cottage looked like it was bubble wrapped from the late seventies, kept in a time capsule and presented to us.  The thing is, I loathe rattan furniture, images of polynesian woman and Hibiscus flower print, but for some reason (for me) it totally worked here at the inn!!
We liked the private patio, the welcome basket and the large kitchen.  Everything was immaculate...except for the carpet in the bedroom (argh!).
Access to the beach is via the reception area for Mama's Fish House, so be sure to take a cover of some sort.
I would think you should consider early morning starts, as delivery trucks and water systems started kicking in early.  Printing boarding passes must be done during office business hours (for non-tech folks).

My boyfriend was turning 50 in Sept, which seemed like the perfect excuse to take another trip to Maui, this time, just as a couple. We booked for a one room garden cottage (the studio the my kids and I stayed in previously was being renovated) and I couldn't wait to see what the one bedroom looked like when I was already in love with the cozy studio.

I think I described it as ""rock star"" living to my kids when we saw in from the beach on our first stay). The attention to detail to make us feel like we were staying in a good friend's home was above and beyond what I would ever expect. All the rooms had fresh plant arrangements in them.

The price may be a bit of an eye-opener but I don't think anyone will regret having gone there.  The Inn at Mama's Fish House is a little gem.  They have only a few cottages and some have been restored and renovated and others are more old Hawaii.  All are well appointed and have all the necessities you will need.  You have access to a wonderful cove that fronts the restaurant and although it is not really swimmable, it is lovely.  There were times that my husband and I were there by ourselves or with only a few others for hours at a time.

My 2 teen age kids and I stayed her for 4 nights and I seriously got a little misty eyed when we had to leave. We wanted a more authentic Hawaiian experience than some of the larger hotels could provide. What we found at Mama's was: free parking, full size washer and dryer WITH fully stocked detergent and fabric softner, fully stocked shed with sand toys, snorkel gear, lawn chairs, mats, coolers. I mean, come on, who thinks of these things?! A semi private garden courtyard with lawn chairs and really nice BBQ. A stamped gecko walkway welcomed us to our door. Central air, which I didn't fully appreciate until we stayed 2 nights in Lahaina where they had one of those awful window air units that didn't keep the room cool and drowned out the sound of the ocean. The bed felt like they shipped a cloud in to sleep on! I am not exaggerating! Sorry to those of you that like a hard mattress, this was so soft, we didn't want to leave it. Free wi-fi, which, again, I didn't appreciate until we stayed at a Lahaina Resort where they charged $10 a day (plus $10 a day parking, $15 for snorkel gear for a day, are you starting to get why Mama's is such a good value?). There was a DVD player (you could borrow DVDs from the office,but we had brought our own), the fully stocked kitchen saved us so much money on eating out which was nice cost wise, but really, we didn't want to leave the grounds any more than we had to. The beach was right there.! It was a little rocky for snorkeling, but it was fine. The bathroom was on the small side but very clean. In testament to Mama's, there were some things out of their control, like construction being done on the apartment complex up the road which could be a little noisy and one day the local energy company having to shut the power off for 5 hours, that, in any lesser place, would have been a source of contention, but we didn't seem to mind here.

However, on this trip I had a very unpleasant surprise, and I will not likely return.

Sleep (a good night's worth of it) is very important to me. I booked the Ulua garden cottage for one night, planning to enjoy the beach in the afternoon, have a nice dinner at the restaurant, and get a good night's sleep before catching my morning flight back home. I was especially looking forward to an early morning snorkel in the small cove in front of Mama's Fish House, when the waves and winds are calm and all kinds of lovely juvenile fishes can be seen. 

I checked in at the office, was given a brief tour of the cottage, and I set about to enjoy the rest of my afternoon. After a soak in the ocean, I headed back to my nicely appointed and charming cottage to have a shower and change for dinner. After dinner, I headed back to the Ulua cottage for what I imagined would be a blissful night's sleep. 

As I walked across the access road from the restaurant to the cottage entrance, it became obvious that there was a loud party going on right next door. At first I couldn't believe my ears -- how could this happen? I kept thinking there must be some mistake -- Mama's would never allow this sort of thing, right? I entered the cottage and assessed the situation: it was as if the partying guests were right inside the bedroom with me. Nothing separated my bedroom window from roughly 20 partying locals but a wooden post fence and 5 feet of air. 

I called the number given on the welcome letter for late-night emergencies. It was an answering machine for Lisa Roth, the Inn's manager. Strike One.

I then called the restaurant and asked to speak to the head Host. When I told him there was a loud party next door and I couldn't sleep, he said he would call them and ask them to quiet down. Now, I don't know about you, but I have had enough experience with loud parties to know how effective that approach really is (not very). Even if they did ""quiet down"" it would still be highly annoying -- mind you, they were only 5-6 feet away from the bedroom -- and they were bound to get rowdy again as the night and alcohol progressed. I really didn't want to spend my evening lying in bed wondering when the hilarity next door would ensue. I told him I did not want the homeowner disturbed, to which he replied, in an exasperated voice, ""well, then, what exactly DO you want me to do??"" Strike Two.

I suggested that they move me to another cottage. He said he would have to call Lisa Roth and we would go from there. Lisa called me about 5 minutes later. After explaining the situation to her, she sweetly insisted that it would be no problem to call the neighbors in the house next door and ask them to quiet down. Certainly it's no problem for her to make a phone call -- it's far, far easier than moving a guest in the middle of the night. But a phone call would be of questionable effectiveness, and time was ticking away. I stated bluntly that I did not prefer the phone call option, I wanted to be moved. She stuck to her guns, insisting the phone call would be ""no problem"". When I asked her why she wouldn't just move me, she said ""...[they] didn't have availability for the duration of my stay."" Oh really? And just how long was my stay? ONE NIGHT!!! This was apparently news to her. Why would she use that lame excuse without even knowing how long I was staying? Anyways, Lisa stuck to her manager's guns and insisted on calling the homeowner AGAINST MY EXPLICIT OBJECTIONS. I felt angry, betrayed, and helpless. Strike Three.

A few minutes later, the phone rang again. It was Lisa, explaining that for some reason she couldn't get through to the homeowner on the phone (gee, what a surprise) and that they were going to move me to one of the vacant units. Yes, ONE of the vacant units... there were several empty cottages that night. By this time, I was frazzled, emotionally exhausted, and ready to leave Mama's Fish House in my rear-view mirror. The only reason I agreed was the lack of decent lodging in the Paia area.

They relocated me to a two-bedroom cottage unit, which was clean and spacious, and seemingly brand new. The bad part was, during the rush to leave the Ulua cottage, I neglected to bring my welcome amenities & breakfast items with me. There was nothing in the new unit, so I had nothing for breakfast in the morning. I discovered this only upon waking up for my cherished morning snorkel before catching my plane. I guess I could have called and woken someone up in the wee morning hours to ask for more bread, please... but based on the attitude I had received the night before, I thought not. I was starving, so I missed out on my snorkel in favor of breakfast in Paia. Altogether, a highly unsatisfactory and depressing experience. 

My advice to Mama's: you know you have a serious recurring problem with noise from your neighbor next to the Ulua cottage, and I am not the first person to find out the hard way. I therefore find it unconscionable and completely unacceptable that you continue to rent this unit out to unsuspecting guests. I encourage you to find another, more suitable use for this unit, perhaps as employee quarters, or as a ""courtesy"" unit. In addition, you have seriously slipped in the customer service area. I will not return and I urge others considering the Ulua unit to make sure they can handle the possibility of loud noise from the private residence next door.","Date of stay: October 2010","Trip type: Traveled solo","ui_bubble_rating bubble_20"

As someone else said, there was a really nice welcome basket on check-in, filled with fresh local fruit, banana bread, and a small package of Kona coffee. This provided us with an absolutely wonderful breakfast the next morning. Unfortunately, they did not replace the fruit on the following days. 

Given the relaxing location and the variety of amazing food at Mama's Fish house, with just a couple of pieces of inexpensive fruit, they could really have created a captive audience. One could really enjoy kicking back and relaxing there for several days without the need to go anywhere else. Unfortunately, without room service of any kind, and with a kitchenette that is little more than a cramped wet bar, you are basically forced to leave the room every day. We then found that once we had left and started exploring the island, time goes by pretty quickly, and we ended up canceling meals we had originally planned to have there. 

There is a very beautiful beach near the ""Beachfront Cottages"", but its are not as private as one might think based on their web page. The beach is right next to the busy pathway to the restaurant, and is center stage for the view from Mama's Fish House. Hardly an ideal place to snorkel, at least for us, and as a restaurant patron, I'm rather glad my view of the ocean wasn't disrupted by a bunch of people from the cottages.

The food at Mama's Fish House was absolutely amazing and we whole heatedly recommend it as a ""must-do"" any time you find yourself on Maui without a bunch of children. However, Mama's Fish House and the Inn are run as separate businesses, and we found that charging the meals to our room and getting the discount they offer was a real hassle, and detracted from what was an otherwise nice experience.

In summary, the room was very beautiful and comfortable, it was very clean and relaxing, and despite the above complaints, my wife and I enjoyed ourselves immensely. The proximity to Mama's Fish House was really nice, but... the lack of amenities and service kept this from really being the ""experience"" we expected based on the room rate and the fame of Mama's Fish House.  While we will definitely go back to the restaurant, we are not as likely to stay at the Inn, and we can't really recommend it to our friends and family.","Date of stay: May 2010","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

I have to say I was quite disappointed.  It was basically rented apartments.  There were really no amenities (besides the dvds you can borrow from the front office) and no sea view.  The staff was pretty much non-existent when we were there.  It was a moderately priced motel really.  It's probably good for families on a bit of a budget and would find having a kitchen and second bedroom quite convenient.  It backs up onto the beach, so there were no views from our room.  The furnishings were nothing special and I got a different sense of the grounds from the website.  It didn't look as nice in person.   I think the best thing it has going for it is the restaurant, which was quite good and the atmosphere very Hawaiian.  Although, I don't know if it's the best on Maui.  I think The Merriman's in Kapalua had a better menu.  Paia was quite lovely and if you are interested in seeing it, then staying at Mama's is probably the best option.

There was a nice welcome basket on the table when we got into the room with fruit, banana bread, and a small package of Kona coffee.  The suite featured a full kitchen, complete with pots, pans, and cutlery.  The towels in the room were wonderfully plush and they all had beautiful fragrant flowers tucked into them.  The bathroom shower was a bit short but it had a handheld sprayer that you could move around which mostly made up for it.  One thing we noticed was that if you flush the toilet while someone is in the shower the water gets scalding hot.  Not a big deal but a bit surprising for a fairly expensive place.  There was a small gecko in the bathroom when we first checked in.  Cute and completely harmless but I know some people get creeped out finding critters in their rooms (although the geckos are pretty much everywhere in Maui--Mama's was not the only place we stayed where we saw them).  Staying at the Inn allows you a 15% percent discount at the Restaurant which is nice because their prices are expensive (although the food is delicious).  The location is nice, there's a beach right nearby attached to the restaurant which you can walk along, but the area where the suites are located is kind of suburban and right off a major road.  Again, not a big deal, but it didn't really feel private.

We found the water to be a little intimidating as the waves were rough, it was very rocky and the wind blew all the time.  I guess that is why they are called the  North Trade Winds.  The food at Mama's was excellent.  We had heard so much about the cost that we actually thought it was not that expensive.  Our waitress was a little aloof with us when we first sat down, but really warmed up when we were given two free appetizers compliments from the office, I am sure due to the noise issue with our friend's room. We did get a 15% discount for being guests at the Inn. 

We ate in town at the Paia Fish Market, wished we had eaten there more often.  We did not have a bad meal.  Don't believe the signs about no food being available on the road to Hana, there were lots of little places to stop for a snack.  Don't miss the road into Ke`ane village.  This is a beautiful stop with great banana bread, fresh coconut and pineapple and sandwiches.  The water on black lava rocks is outstanding. By staying at Mama's you are right on the road to Hana.  Would love to go back.","Date of stay: June 2009","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Excellent choice.

We were in one of the one bedroom cottages.  Large bedroom , living room with couch and loveseat, a dining table, and a full kitchen (stove, fridge, microwave, double sink, blender, grinder, coffeepot, all dishes, glasses, silverware, pots, pans, etc).  Outside was a private patio with a gas grill, table, chairs, large umbrella.  There were flowering plants everywhere.

We could not have asked for a better place to stay.  Every detail you could want was anticipated.  It was all the little things (beer and martini glasses in the freezer in case for example), basket of fruits and banana bread on arrivial, replacing the beach towels every day that made the difference.  

Having a full kitchen, an outdoor gas grill, and all the pots, pans, grilling stuff, etc was also a huge plus.  Cook up a couple of eggs, toast a muffin, and enjoy breakfast outside on the private patio with the newspaper they leave for you each morning.  After a day out and about, it's nice to kick back with a good bottle of wine and fire up the grill.  

The unit was very spacious, exactly as pictured on the website. Free parking, plenty of security driving around in the golf cart.  The staff will walk you over and show you where your unit is, how to get to the beach, where the free washer and dryer are, etc.  

One of the marks of a good place is how often you see the staff.  This was perfect.  You never saw them, but everything was taken care of. Beds made, linens changed, unit cleaned, dishes put away, newspaper delivered, all without ever seeing anybody doing it.

This is such a different experience from the mega resort hotels, and some people may not appreciate it, but we loved it and Mama's will be the first place we call when we return to Maui at some point in the future.

You also get a discount at the wonderful restaurant.  Paid wireless internet, but from our unit there was a open router that was easy to connect to.","Date of stay: September 2009","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

This was our third trip to Maui.  The Mamas Fish House Inn was our choice.  Thank you previous posters.

Mamas Fish House Inn offered a great value, a clean and open cottage, amenities that I didn't dream of and a great location near Paia.  The Ulua cottage had a private patio, a nice grill for cooking a steak, beach chairs and a cooler for a beach trip, and a very open floor plan.  The AC worked great.  The room was immaculate.  The daily flowers and weekly flower arrangements were very beautiful.

We only stayed 5 nights, I wished we had stayed our entire trip here rather and 5 nights in Honolulu.  If you ever have to choose between Honolulu and Paia, Paia hands down.  The nearby park was an excellent place to jog each morning.  The scenery around Paia is wonderful.  Paia is only 2 miles away.  There is lots to do and shop there.  A quaint little town.  Makewao is nearby and and great visit.

The staff at Mama's was excellent.  Every detail is well attended.  The service was excellent.

Upon arriving early for the reservation (11:30 am) our room was unavailable  for a garden studio.  They happily upgraded us to a Junior Suit that was amazing.  I would have happily paid to stay there.  The attention to detail was amazing, a welcome letter addressed to us was accompanied by a plate of  fruit, breakfast bread and good coffee to be made in the morning.  Flowers on the towels and on the newspaper delivered in the morning.was a wonderful touch.   Nothing makes me happeir than great service and attention to the little things.  The closet even  had a cooler bag (extra good for Hana snacks) , umbrella and flash light.  When you live in the land of resorts, everyone has the attitude that you just pay 500 bucks for a room and ask nothing else.  

We made dinner reservations and had another great meal (that makes 3 over the past few years).  To our delight, they also took 15% off of the bill because we stayed at the Inn.  

While we left our twins at home, we would gladly take them to Mama' without hesitation.  The beach is perfect during low tide and has a nice little wading pool.

I still can't quite put into words how beautiful it was!

After spending three days on Waikiki, we were looking for a slower pace and a more relaxing atmosphere. Our flight got into Maui earlier than the posted check-in, but Lisa, the very gracious  manager, met us right away and took us to our room. They had upgraded usto one of the newer garden cottages, which are just absolutely breath-taking. They are more like private villas - way more upscale than my husband and I have ever stayed in. The attention to detial is still there - fresh flowers everyday, a basket of fruit, bread, and coffee waiting for you when you arrive, and all of the amenities that one could possibly need for the duration of your stay. The staff were always close at hand to make sure that we had everything we needed as well, and greeted us as if we were old friends. The newspaper is delivered daily, free of charge.The private beach is lovely as well, and makes you feel like you are really living the high life, whereas this place was actually one of the cheaper places we stayed at. The best part about the cottage was the brand-new bed and the VERY high-quality linens that they used. We stayed at resorts rated 4 1/2 stars throughout the course of our honeymoon as well, and nothing was as soft or as clean as the linens that were given to us there. 

For a garden cottage, we did not see a single bug during our stay. The only visitor that we got was a cute little gecko, but he was out on the lanai and added to the ambience. The windows are also treated so that very little can be seen from the outside, and the sun is shaded on the inside. At night, all the windows (cathedral sized windows!) were able to be screened by thick drapes. We didn't even know when it was morning. Noise was also not an issue, but it also appeared that we were staying there during the off-season. It did appear that the Inn itself had 24-hour security, which was comforting being that it is a bit off the beaten path. 

Of course, dinner can't be missed at the restaurant - it is a bit pricy but for good reason. It is easily one of the best meals that I have ever had. The staff is just as attentive there, knowledgeable of the dishes, and able to make recommendations for those are not always fish-eaters. 

Overall, we would stay here again in a heartbeat. The only thing that we regret is that we couldn't stay longer!","Date of stay: September 2007","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We have always heard about the great food at Mama's so when I found out we could book a room, it was a no brainer.

We stayed on one of the ""cottages"" which are off the back side of Mama's, somewhat in a congested alleyway which is used for deliveries to the restaurant. I envisioned more of a cottage on the beach (there is a 4 unit cottage on the beach) however the cottages off the alley are more like apartments in Southern California that the Ropers lived in the 70's. It was very high density.

The inside was decorated nicely, beautiful flowers folded into the towels and amazing fruit. Each unit has an outdoor sitting area and a nice barbeque. The views from these sitting areas are the sides of other houses-one with lots of windows and you can see everything the dwellers are up to (which could make fun sport!).
Luckily we were out and about all day long so only stayed at our place at night.

We loved being near Paia and explored the eastern side of the island. We loved being right at Mama's for dinner every night which is stupendous!

We liked that cute little beach-mostly because no one goes there so we felt like we were really away from the maddening crowds.

Our last night there (2 night stay), someone decided to have a party. It seems like right behind the 1970's apartments pretending to be ""Guest Cottages"", there is a house where some of the wait staff l/kitchen staff lives. At 11:00 pm, the music started getting louder We heard a gate open and close about 100 times between 11 and 1:00 am. And as per usual for most annoying parties, lots of yelling and screaming. This party was right over the 4 ft wall that separated our yard from the next house. It was loud and they didn't stop until 4 in the morning.

We couldn't wait to get out of there. I would go back again only if I could make sure I get that to stay in that cute little beachfront cottage. My husband , on the other hand, said never again.","Date of stay: November 2007","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

We now believe the one bedroom cottage at Mama's is probably ideal for a couple who plan to make only light use of the kitchen, or for short-termers who want a few days of easier access to Hana and Haleakala, or for people who would be happy with Mama's beach for lounging and are not looking to surf and snorkel all day.

For us, there are three centers of activity on Maui:  Paia and Upcountry, stretching up through Makawao to Haleakala;  South Kihei down to Makena; Lahaina up to Kapalua.  We are outdoors people.  We like Haleakala for hiking, Kihei and south for snorkeling and kayaking if there is not a south swell;  Lahaina and north for surfing and for snorkeling if there is a south swell.  There is nowhere central to stay among these three regions except for Maalaea, which has other drawbacks.  When we schedule the trip, we can't predict which part of the island we'll be using most for beaches, because it depends upon the swell and the wind when we get there.   We reasoned that we did not need a beachfront location because we are always driving to different beaches., and we don't need a swimming pool when we're snorkeling and surfing all day.  Mama's has a beach, but it is a sunbather's beach, not a snorkeler's or surfer's beach.  Mama's is near Hookipa, which is a great surfing beach, but for the solid local surfer, not for the person who surfs a handful of times a year.

We took a one-bedroom cottage at Mama's for two parents and two elementary-school age kids, staying 8 nights.  The kids slept on the pullout couch and on an aerobed that we brought.  The pullout couch sleeper woke up grumbling the first morning, so we ended up with two twin-size aerobeds on the floor.  The cottage was immaculate, with attentive daily maid service.  You could see their pride of ownership and high-end standards of service.  A maintenance man stopped by one day to pick up the cooking grates from our gas grill and clean them.   Aerobed linens were quickly provided, a futon that we did not have room for was immediately removed, and the maids took as much care making up the aerobeds as they did everything else.  Mama's has security all night.  There was no noise from the restaurant that disrupted us whatsoever.  How they keep the bugs out, is a mystery.  There were fresh flowers in the cottage.

The plusses:    We saw a Haleakala sunrise that we would never have seen if we had stayed anywhere else, because we woke up in time to get there from Paia, but the additional travel time from South Maui or West Maui would have made us miss it.   Upcountry was very accessible (Hana would also have been more accessible, were we interested.)  We like the town of Paia, and we made good use of it on our way through it at morning and evening, but you do not walk Hana Hwy with young kids from Paia to Mama's, because of the distance and the lack of sidewalk.   Mama's property is a lush environment.  We had a front and back lanai, both completely private with beautiful landscaping and fragrant blooms.  The front lanai had a generous overhang and table, was walled off with a large gate, and served almost as an extra room to sit and to store our watersports equipment, sandy footwear, cases of bottled water, etc.  We did feel more ""away"" than we had in Wailea, where we felt surrounded by people from our home region.

The minuses:  the cottage did not have a dishwasher, although we thought from Mama's website that it did.  This was a bit of a drawback for us, as we eat all breakfasts in, pack lunches, and cook many dinners, and we like to have it as good as we have it at home (which is not using paper plates, nor washing a big sink full of dishes after every meal).  The cottage was pretty cramped for four people.  To leave the aerobeds out, we had to put the coffee table behind the dining table, cramping that area, and forego use of the couch.  There is absolutely no view out of the one-bedroom cottage:  from the living area, you look out the slider onto the walled lanai.  From the bedroom and kitchen, you look out the window onto some other residential dwellings across the road.  The trucks that service the back of the restaurant use that road.  The cottage has central air.  We used it, in part because of allergies, and I'm sure you need it, because the cottage is nestled in among so much foliage that there cannot be much natural ventilation.  We also missed easy access to the farm markets in North Kihei and Honokowai.  The farm market at the Queen Kaahumanu Center in Kahului was not as good.  We like to get Kula produce at a farm market and eat it that evening, and we did not realize what a special part of the trip this was until this time, when it did not  happen as readily.  We just found it easier to hit the North Kihei farm market in the afternoon when we were staying in South Maui, and the produce was better.  We also found in Wailea that the Safeway was on our way back to the condo every night, whereas at Mama's, we had to make a detour into Kahului, or use Mana Foods in Paia, which is a health food store.  This was not a big problem, but as a vacationer, time is what you're paying for, so we want a location that maximizes our enjoyable time.

I am not at all sorry we stayed at Mama's, as it was clean, safe, and reasonably comfortable, and the price seems to fairly acknowledge the limitations.  I have no complaints because they absolutely held up their end of the bargain on every aspect (except maybe the dishwasher).  But I now see the benefit to our family of being within walking distance of at least one beach that we really expect to use for our watersports, and how much more relaxing it is to have a little more physical space and privacy, and how much we like to sit on a lanai and look out at the ocean or the hillside.  As mentioned, the one bedroom cottage is probably ideal for a couple who eat out a lot, for a few days of easier access to Hana and Haleakala, or for those who like to lounge on a quiet beach without surfing or snorkeling.

The single biggest aloha experience of the trip was surfing with Rick, the owner of Hawaiian Style Surf School.  I found him through the A3H Gold Card and he comes up on a website.  We had a personalized, uncrowded, genuine surf coaching experience, tailored to each person's level, as opposed to the one-size-fits-all, adequate-but-impersonal tourist assembly line treatment we know from one of the big-name heavily promoted surf schools.  If we return to Maui, we will call Rick as soon as we have booked the flights and lodging.","Date of stay: August 2006","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

We were amazed by the beautiful fresh flowers around our room everday.  Although the company's main concern is the restaurant, the staff spoils the Inn guests as well.

Stay here before it becomes too popular to reserve a room!  

We loved Paia.  It is a real town, with real people. Not a facade. We met interesting people who were friendly, interesting, informed, and intelligent. Did I mention diverse as well?  We also met some characters and thank god for characters in this world.  We are not resort types and did not love our stay on the west side of the island. We found better restaurants on this side of the island.  Recommend Mambo, Paia Fish and Manano(sp?) Bakery and Restaurant.  Loved Mam's Fish House, but be prepared to spend $$$$.  Good food, great attention to detail but overpriced.  We did enjoy our dinner and the experience.   Walk over to the surfer beach right down the road for some great entertainment.  

We also recommend the Sunrise Bike Company in Paia.  Paulo knows his history of the area, the people and places to visit.  Sunrise does not make you travel in a group, a big plus is you have people who do not know how to ride a bike well or are afraid of going downhill. These types can be the only dangerous part of a bike trip down the volcano.  Paulo also have brand new Trek bikes, a big step above other bikes we saw going downhill.","Date of stay: March 2006","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I chose the Cottages mainly because it's very convenient to the Kahului airport.  We'd just stayed for 2 nites in Lahaina and then 5 nites in Hana and wanted to have one last leisurely day/nite in Paradise before flying home.  We stayed at the one bedroom Manini Cottage which doesn't have an ocean view, but is a very short walk thru Mama's grounds to their pretty, palm tree lined beach.  I believe that there are a total of 9 guest units (most duplex types) on Mama's property inc. 2 guest houses (2 units in each: upstairs/downstairs) that have ocean views.  In going to the business office to check in, we were a bit disappointed initially because it's located at the rear of the restaurant and the area looks very commercial, with a large employee parking area.  However, the cottages are removed somewhat from that area and the exteriors of the non-ocean view units look like modest, but very tidy residences with plantings and trees surrounding them.   We parked right in the drive of our cottage instead of in a parking lot.  Our Manini Cottage turned out to be an absolutely perfect place to stay.  All the rooms were spacious, very clean, and comfortably and pleasantly furnished--much like a nice condo unit.  The cottage had a fully equipped kitchen, air conditioning, large screen TV, stereo, and a deligthtful, very private patio with table and chairs and a large (propane, I believe) barbeque.  A most welcome amenity was our own private laundry room just a few steps out the back door--and no charge for using the machines.  They even supplied detergent.  

The management staff was friendly, helpful and efficient.  As a welcome gift we found a huge fruit basket laden with all types of tropical fruit inc. a pineapple (which we took home with us--it was delicious), guava, mango, papaya, avocado, bananas, kiwi and many other items.  The frig had bottled water in it, but there was a $1.50 charge for each--not a problem.  Early the next morning a staff member unobstrusively delivered the local paper and placed a pretty star ginger flower on top of it.  The only ""complaints"" I had were no box of tissues and the very thin wash cloths.  We had the most restful, peaceful nite of our entire stay on Maui.  I heard not one voice or car the entire nite--it was truly wonderful and exactly what we needed prior to a long return trip home.  

Of course we had dinner at Mama's that night and it was as wonderful an experience as it had been in the past.  Mama's just celebrated their 30th anniversary and they remain at the very top in food, service and in ""island atmosphere"".  What a great, fun place to be!  We noticed that the staff also seemed to truly enjoy working there and were having a great time themselves.  The next morning before checking out, we walked along the beach and saw a double rainbow over the ocean.  

Next time we return to Maui we'll do Upcountry and will stay at Mama's as it has the ideal, central location to get around the island--very convenient to get to the airport, Lahaina, Haleakala and even a big headstart on the way to Hana.  The little town of Paia has a number of inviting cafes and restaurants, too.  We also had a superb lunch at the Haliimaile Store, which is a short drive from Paia.  But even if we never leave Mama's property, we would be able to experience a totally delightful time in Paradise--what a place!","null","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Sensei is by far one of the most relaxing and special experiences I’ve ever had.  I will preface this review by saying that if you want the quintessential Hawaii experience with mai tai’s, tiki torches, beaches and hula dancers then this place is not for you. If you want sophistication and relaxation at a beautiful peaceful spot that feels more like Thailand or some other exotic location then this is for you. 

To start, the flight in on Lana’i Air was very quick and on time. It was windy when we departed Honolulu so the flight was pretty bumpy. If you are prone to motion sickness then just be prepared. We had our own plane which was nice and made the experience all the more enjoyable. Once we landed in Lana’i, we were met planeside by a Tesla SUV. We never had to touch a bag as everything was transferred directly from the plane to the car.  Zero stress and very efficient. 

Check-in: Pulling up to Sensei you get an incredible sense of calm and peace. As you enter the driveway of the hotel, you are greeted by at least 5-6 Fernando Botero statues. Upon exiting the car, the typical Hawaiian Kukui nut lei greeting takes place and you are also offered a nice tea. Check-in was very seamless and easy; you are taken to one of the many seating areas in the beautiful lobby to complete the check-in process. Also, the amazing art doesn’t just stop at the entrance outside, it continues all throughout the property. There is a beautiful Jeff Koons statue in the middle of the lobby that really gets your attention.  The lobby is like an upscale lodge with massive fireplaces on either end and seating everywhere. It was never crowded which was always nice. There is also a library and game room off the lobby which was very nice as we like to play cards and backgammon a lot. 

Rooms: The rooms are great and very relaxing. The lighting is good and the neutral colors allow for a very chill stay. They also provide you with a nice Yeti water bottle to use throughout your stay and to keep afterwards which was pretty cool. I really enjoyed the room but didn’t spend much time in it as the rest of the property is more spectacular. There are no tubs in the rooms but that wasn’t an issue for us. 

Bar & Restaurant: Before coming to Sensei, I was a little apprehensive that it would be a health nut retreat with only super healthy things and no great food or drink options for those of us not counting calories every meal; luckily, I was wrong. The Garden Bar is awesome. The staff are incredibly friendly and they make some great drinks. It also is nice that you can order off the main Nobu restaurant menu but sit in the bar area instead which is a little more casual. The restaurant was also a highlight here as well. All the staff are very nice and the setting is beautiful. The restaurant is surrounded by a beautiful koi pond that truly makes things even more relaxing. Breakfast, lunch and dinner are all great here.  While it is a special independent restaurant called Sensei by Nobu, the menu still has some Nobu signature dishes like the Miso Black Cod and the Nobu chocolate bento box which was nice. We ate dinner at the restaurant 7 nights in a row and never got tired of it. 

Spa: This is probably the true hi-light of the property. Their 10 spa hales are over the top. When you get a treatment, you are given your own private spa facility complete with your own sauna, steam room, hot tub, plunge pool, indoor/outdoor shower, waterfall, Japanese soaking tub etc. I’ve had a lot of massages in my life but the ones I got at Sensei were the most relaxing mainly due to the incredible facilities.  They even let you reserve the hales for relaxation time without any treatments. I did this on my last day because I loved it so much. 

Pool:  The pool is very quiet and relaxing. It is not over the top but still amazing. You can also get food and drink service at the pool which is nice too. They also have a really special area on the property with a bunch of onsen pools (think private hot tubs built into rocks and surrounded by waterfalls and cool plants). It was fun because you can choose whatever onsen pool you want as long as no one else is in it. They are also open at night so you can sit in the tubs and look at the stars (if the clouds allow)

Activities: There are tons of things on offer at Sensei. We went for many walks around the area which were fun. We stopped to look at the ropes course which was awesome but we are saving that for another trip. They have horse riding as well but we didn’t take advantage of that. One day, we played golf down on the course by Manele Bay and it was amazing. There was only one other person out on the course so we basically had it all to ourselves (and this was on a Saturday!!!). There is also a shuttle you can take to the beach resort in order to do ocean activities but we passed since we had just come from the Four Seasons Hualalai and got all of our ocean time in while we were there. 

Final Thoughts:  Sensei is a very special place. We originally only planned to stay there for 2 nights and then move down to the beach resort. After checking out on day 3 to move to the ocean property, we realized on arrival that it was nowhere near the caliber of Sensei (lots of loud construction going on at the entryway and lobby that we weren’t made aware of, crowded and very small pool areas, pretty yet overpriced rooms with mediocre views, etc.). You can also tell the ocean property was originally built as a more mainstream brand and not a luxury brand like Four Seasons (if you want the best Four Seasons beach/ocean experience in Hawaii, go to the Four Seasons Hualalai on the Big Island). Luckily, when the staff realized we weren’t happy at the new hotel, they were able to get us rooms back up at Sensei where we finished out our last 5 days. They were very understanding and accommodating which was much appreciated.  Sensei is a great spot and worth the visit. I can’t wait until my next visit.","Date of stay: July 2022","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Hands down the most stunning resort we’ve ever visited and we have been to some really beautiful ones. The best of both worlds with adding in the ability to utilize the beach/golf of 4S Lanai as well as the restaurants. Loved that it was adults only as the other resorts we visited on the trip had lots of kids. Earlier in the trip we stayed at 4S Hualalai, so some of my comments on service and facilities are in comparison to that experience.  Service at Sensei was not as polished as Hualalai, and there were several niggles, which seem to be mostly about staff communicating with each other and working well as a team, some of them had only been there a few months so that could be a reason. For example, one night at dinner we had wonderful, personable service and the 2nd dinner was a bit chaotic…took forever to get cocktails, they tried to bring our food before we had our cocktails, everyone just not working well together. They seemed to have plenty of staff so that did not appear to be the issue. The room, the pool, the grounds, the Onsens…just gorgeous and relaxing. Definitely rent a jeep and explore the island, although be prepared for very bumpy roads.  Missed opportunity: all the other resorts we stayed at had lovely outdoor sofas on the balcony or patio…Sensei had a huge balcony and only one tiny table and dining chairs so you couldn’t really enjoy the balcony…I hope that’s on their list of future improvements. 3 night stay was lovely but a little brief, I think 1 week would be too long…next visit we will go for 4 or 5 nights! Shuttle transportation from ferry and to/from FS Lanai was efficient. Would love it if they added one more restaurant (there’s only one).  If I had to recommend a perfect tropical honeymoon or special trip for a couple it would be FS Hualalai to experience the Big Island and an incredible beach resort together with Four Seasons Sensei for the idyllic, peaceful, sculpture-filled Garden of Eden!","Date of stay: August 2022","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Because we were celebrating a birthday, the hotel upgraded our room and gave us a bottle of champagne. Very nice touches! But there are a few areas for improvement:

1. We were celebrating my boyfriend’s birthday, and his friend had called the hotel in advance to arrange for a birthday cake to be delivered on his actual birthday. Unfortunately, the hotel made a mistake and sent the cake one day late. 
2. We ordered room service, and there was a hair in my pasta.

Needless to say that most of our expectations were met or the Sensei team exceeded our expectations.

First, service: Everyone at Sensei is always looking to offer assistance, even if you don't need help. They are so kind and welcoming. They always say aloha with a smile (presumably sometimes, behind their masks) and they genuinely care about the experience. The ""red carpet"" service starts from the airport pickup and it did not end until we checked out.

Second, property and room: The property sits on a secluded island, far back in the forest. The natural beauties that the forest brings were very well-kept by the landscaping teams. It was so serene and relaxing because the property isn't mobbed with tourists or kids (no offense to families with kids) which is exactly what we needed after planning and executing our wedding. The room we stayed in was kept so clean and dust-free with a lot of great amenities and features.

Third, experience: Everything, from the breakfast at Sensei by Nobu (I recommend the Traditional Japanese Breakfast. Though, it's not for everyone because it has a roasted fish, miso, rice, and etc AND it's not cheap), semi-private yoga session, couples massage, private 1:1 nutrition consultation with a registered dietitian, sunset sailing, and a fun day at the adventure park, was amazing. One thing I would note is that if you have motion sickness, do NOT participate in the sailing... My wife got really sick for the better half of the cruise and did not enjoy it AT ALL.

Notes: I wish that we could have gotten to Lana'i City more because it's such a quaint town that offers a lot. We got to see it once when we had to go to its market to buy something to eat quickly before the cruise. We were so surprised that one of our favorite wines had Costco pricing (!)

I really have nothing bad to say our stay at Sensei. It was so memorable and I already talked to my wife about returning for our anniversary. The price is definitely steep but I'd say it's worth every penny.","Date of stay: June 2022","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I don't know what Ellison was thinking with this project but if anyone remembers the Lodge at Keole (predecessor to Sensei) they'll know what we lost. I stayed at Keole twice, it was the most perfect hotel establishment I've visited. It was a true reflection of old plantation style upcountry Hawaii combined with artistic vision. It had colors! I was again on Lanai during renovation and at first glance my heart sunk. There is no connection of this resort to the land it sits on. It looks like it was designed for Instagram selfies! Beige on white, totally generic, no sense of Hawaii other than tropical plants, no risks taken. Lanai was one of the last places that still felt like old Hawaii, sadly Sensei is another loss of the beautiful spirit that makes this island so special.","Date of stay: September 2021","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_10"

WORST FOUR SEASONS IN HAWAII. TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE. WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!","My husband and I stayed at the property with high expectations. It was a mistake and worst Four Seasons and Hotel in Hawaii!
Property is gorgeous and exquisitily appointed. But service and options are terrible:
- not enough dining and food options. Only one restaurant and menu does not change
- no service at the pool
- all activities always booked and no spots available
- very noisy service team (landscaping, housekepping)
- ipads in the room do not work
- people at front desk never pick up the phone
- you order things (like moutwash) and it is never delivered
- concierge simply “forgets” to return your call to confirm or discuss activities
- water pressure in the shower is non-existing; it feels like a cheap 2 stars hotel
Overall it was a HUGE disappointment and not worth at all. There are so many better options in Hawaii!!
It is a shame given how gorgeous and nice the property is physically and from an art and architeture point of view. 
They should definetely improve training and add more staff.
I would never do it again and strongly reccomend people not to waste time and money going there.","Date of stay: May 2022","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_10"

Imagine walking through the finest botanical garden and thinking how wonderful it would be to live inside of it.  And then imagine elite, grand sculptures scattered among the flowers, trees and plants.  That is Sensei Lana'i.  The Hale suites were beyond exquisite.   I was also able to enjoy hiking, electric mountain biking, horse back riding,  aerial yoga, deep relaxation and even tried meditation among the elements.  Even when you are inside, you felt like you were outside in the gardens.  I had a great tennis lesson at The Four Seasons Hotel, but couldn't wait to return to the unique and uncommercialized atmosphere of Sensei.  

During my stay, I mentioned to one of the staff that I felt centered, and he said ""In the middle of the Pacific Ocean lie the Hawaiian Islands.  And in the middle of the Hawaiian Islands is the island of Lana'i.  And in the middle of Lana'i is Sensei.  This is why you feel centered.""  And this is the impression I walked away with.

As the other reviewers have said - immaculate, a beautiful resort. You can tell the absolute attention to detail involved in every plant and every design element. We were in awe. 

The private flights and Tesla transfers were just the cherry on top.

A couple tips for travelers:
- We booked through Amex fine hotels which included ($48/person/day breakfast at Nobu and $100 resort credit). The breakfast was delightful and there was a huge selection. We never exceeded that limit, and we ordered a lot : )
- For all the days of our visit, the weather at Sensei is cooler (about 7 degrees) than at the Four Seasons in Manele Bay just down the road. It was also far more likely to rain or be cloudy. I’d recommend packing some layers and for rainy days, taking the shuttle down to the Four Seasons
- We rented a jeep for a day from the front desk (super easy! $225 for 24 hours). Super fun to go off roading. They give you a great map too. 
- We went down to the Four Seasons a couple times and that was amazing too. Great restaurants. So nice to be able to switch it up and get away.
- The sunset sail they also offered was terrific and the boat was beautiful and plenty of room to spread out. The boat was only 2 years old!
- Every class I did at Sensei was exceptional. My favorite was Eduardo’s teaching of Yoga & Meditation. Potentially my favorite yoga class…. Ever.
- Definitely book your classes when you arrive because they do book up. But we got to do most everything we wanted to do.
- The spa experiences were pricey but the Hales where they take place were like nothing I’d ever seen before. Again, recommend! The massage was also terrific. 
- Finally, the Onsen garden - I had no idea what this was. Basically it’s a bunch of little private hot tubs nestled in the greenery. Super unique and super cool!","Date of stay: April 2022","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We were given different answers for several questions.  We called for ice delivery (the only way to get ice) and it took 45+ minutes (while they told us 5-10 minutes) and then they brought a small bucket (we had asked for large bucket for wine to be chilled).  We arranged for a porter to pick up our bags and they never showed.  Upon arrival went to ladies room in lobby, the hook on the door was missing, so went to the next ""stall"" --- same thing, checked a third stall, again same thing.  Out of 5 or 6 stalls only 2 had hooks for purses etc (otherwise you put on the floor, ugh).  Then the TP holder in the stall broke!  Not a good start.  Went to the front desk and pointed out the poor condition in the ladies room and asked if they could please check into it!  The breakfast is excellent!  However, the service very poor --- waited for over 20 minutes to get coffee refill and cream.  Went to order Scotch at dinner and the server didn't have a clue as to ""bar pour"" also though they were trying hard the staff at dinner were constantly interrupting our conversation to ask if all was suitable, and then if we were finished so they could clear the table (very distracting while hoping to have a relaxing dinner).  So the service was either non existent or they were constantly interrupting our meal and conversation (very inconsistent and not at all like other Four Seasons).  The one employee we found who had the Four Seasons service down pat --- the bartender!  I believe his name is Chicky and when we went in to have a light lunch of salad and tea he handed us a menu that had neither!  We had just check with the hostess at Nobu and she indicated that the bar menu served what we wanted and so we headed over there (she was incorrect).  However, once Chicky heard our situation after we sat down and were settled in he said ""I will take care of it"", and he did!  He went over to Nobu and placed the order and brought it to our table at the bar --- now THAT is the Four Seasons Service!  We found that though the staff may mean well, they really are not trained and look at you blankly when asked a question; no effort to say ""I'm not sure, I'll check and get back to you"".  In any case the grounds are incredible and serene; however for the prices they charge we would expect excellent service from a 5 star hotel.","Date of stay: April 2022","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

The experience was amazing and truly blissful. This place is so relaxing and the people are lovely. 

A special thanks to all of the staff who helped us. Our servers were always friendly and seemed happy to see us each day. Make sure to ask Nancy for a Poi donut - super yummy. The front desk and Sensei experience staff always greeted us with a smile and were super helpful in rearranging our activities when weather forced a cancellation or we wanted to add extra activities. We kept Tamara and Natascha busy! Cameron is always there to help and he just knows how it all works. The staff was always welcoming and called us by our names. They knew what we needed many times before we even knew we needed something. 

The spa services are exquisite and make sure to book extra hale time for a most enjoyable and relaxing time. Definitely try several different spa services and you won't be disappointed in any of them. Try to book the aquatic bodywork with Liran, as it is unbelievable. Highly recommend spa services. 

The grounds are gorgeous, the pool is serene and you must try an onsen especially in the evening. The property is within walking distance to town so you can walk or take the shuttle in for a bit of shopping or to hang out in the park. 

We personally found Sensei by Nobu to be the best restaurant for dinner. It was consistently excellent and there were plenty of menu choices. We did go to the FS Beach Resort for beach time but preferred the vibe and peacefulness of Sensei. 

Recommended activities: Equestrian-ask for Kara and stay to greet Peggy the goat, Koloiki Ridge Hike with Maria and Gabby, Sunset sail and snorkeling with Ricky, Martin and Junior, Meditation with Lisa and do a Target Activations with Skyler. The group exercise and yoga classes were great. We were always happy we went even when we really just wanted to sleep in.

Koele used to be dark and  stodgy, but the space is now light and  lush. The grounds are out of the Jurassic period; palms, orchids and bromeliads, all surrounding water features you can hear almost anywhere on property. We chose the wellness package which seems pricey, but includes a discount to the room rate, and we came out of the treatments feeling cosseted. Our room faced a big banyan tree in back, so we woke up with the sound of birds until they retired at sunset (watch “Avatar” before you go).
Restaurant  food was clean and fresh with chef knowing how to cook a perfect poached egg. Lots of dishes include produce direct from their garden, evident by the taste and freshness. 
The sunrise hike  is a perfect way to start the day. Putting course at cocktail hour. The library for a nice chess match.  Bruno and his parrots, at the beach hotel, are a hoot  and Malibu Farms lunch is good. Snorkel trip on the hotel's 65' cat, where we saw dolphins, whales with calves.  All of the staff we encountered  were seemingly telepathic, and contrary to previous posts, the front desk staff were attentive and accommodating.

Despite being told the resort was full, it never felt like there were any guests around! 

We stayed in the Koele Deluxe Room and had a beautiful view of the ranch across the street. Pictures on their website felt accurate. The room was very comfortable and spacious. Every day, there are different goodies in your room, from fresh fruit, a plate of pastries, charcuterie and cookies. There's also a mini fridge with water. 

There is only one main restaurant (Sensei Nobu) for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Menus are located on their website. The menu is not the same as the Nobu at the beach resort down the street, but there are a lot of ingredients that overlap and prepared consistent with the other Nobu restaurant. I additionally liked that not everything was made in-house, such as the pastries that is supplied locally by a nearby bakery or the fresh juice that is provided by a local supplier. We really enjoyed every dish!

The resort itself is beautiful and spacious and a lot of complimentary activities are offered. We took advantage of the onsen at the far end of the resort. The onsen has maybe 8 (?) spas hidden throughout, making it very private to relax and enjoy some peace and quiet. The hike to Koloiki ridge was amazing and not as difficult as I thought it would be. You can definitely spend all your time at the resort without ever leaving!

The front desk / concierge was very helpful in organizing activities, such as jeep rental, snorkel and sunset sail excursions. We took a day trip to Maui and they also coordinated transportation to/from the harbor, which was very helpful. I was nervous things would be booked quickly and coordinated my activities and restaurant reservations prior to arrival. If you aren't a planner, I don't think there's any issues to reserve upon arrival. We add and modified some of our reservations and they were able to move things around without any difficulty. 

Regarding which resort is right for you? 
The advantages of staying at Sensei Lanai: Being close to Lanai City allows options to eat at local restaurants, explore the little town and learn a little history about Lanai (visitor's center was interesting). I highly recommend Chengdu Taste at the Hotel Lanai. This location is also more accessible to land activities, such as the Adventure Park obstacle course, hiking to Koloiki ridge, horseback riding and other ranch activities across the street. The off-roading trails to Shipwreck Beach/Petroglyphs, Garden of the Gods and Kaunolu Village site is also more convenient to access as well as the Lanai Cat Sanctuary and Kaumalapau Harbor (beautiful harbor to watch sunset). If you want peace and quiet (i.e., no kids) and the feeling that you are the only guests in the resort (despite it being full), Sensei Lanai is perfect. 

The downside of Sensei Lanai is being further away from water activities. Hulopoe Beach and the harbor to do the snorkel and sunset sail excursion is about a 20-30 minutes drive (each way) down a very windy road (compared to 5 minutes from the beach resort). It can get tedious, especially after a long day. The other downside is there are more dining options at the beach resort if you don't want to leave the resort. If you enjoy the beach scene and being surrounded by more people and kids, Sensei Lanai is not right for you. 

As it pertains to COVID procedures, vaccination status was checked upon arrival and I appreciated that everyone was very  mindful about wearing masks. The hotel does a great job spacing out the tables and being mindful of guest's safety. 

If you want to relax and get away from it all, this resort is perfect. Highly recommend!","Date of stay: December 2021","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Tony is a passionate foodie and great server.  We were there for a week and the food was consistent perfection, every meal.  Ariel, who does yoga is  masterful and a blanket of calmness. Sadly, the biggest challenge was the front desk.  The check in seemed ""unpracticed"". They missed many details, such as you actually need to sign up for any wellness classes the second you check in.  If you don't, you will be so disappointed.  Also, they never mentioned that you can't get into the gym.  You need a special card, and somehow they don't know that?  The FD also can't make a restaurant reservation correctly.  Just go directly to Jeff, he will get you in and avoid the annoying FD confusion.  Also, the rooms do not go cooler than 67.  If you need to sleep in actual AC, they don't have that. DO NOT get room 303, under the stairs.  All night and all day banging on the ceiling in the room.  Not sure why the FD would ever give that to someone who was there for a week, and not expect a complaint. The FD are not given any way to resolve issues, you have to wait for a manager.  It's a hot mess there, seems very disorganized and papers spread everywhere, and they look at you as if they just met you. No name recognition at all. I will say, the restaurant ALWAYS used our names, every meal, BL&D.

There were a few missteps on our trip that took it from a 5-star review to 2 stars.  The private plane experience is efficient, but seats and seatbelts are uncomfortable and it's quite loud.  Still, can't beat landing to a waiting Tesla and being whisked to the resort.  The resort arranges your flight, and we arrived at the hotel at 1:30.  Our room wasn't ready, which was fine, we enjoyed a leisurely lunch before checking in.  Official check in time is 3pm, and at 3:45 I finally went to the front desk and asked about our room.  They apologized and said it would be another 15-30 minutes.  If I had known in advance how long it would actually take, I would have asked for our swim suits and enjoyed the pool complex.  Instead, we sat and sat in the lobby, until 4:30 when I had to ask again for an update.  Another apology, will be no more than 30 additional minutes.  No offer to buy our lunch, suggest an activity...so we sat in the lobby and waited.  And waited.  We had a 6pm dinner and needed to shower and get ready, so at 5:15 I asked them to please let us in the room to shower and change.  We didn't get into the room until 5:30!  Never in my long history of travel have I ever checked in later than 3pm to a hotel.  Much less a Four Seasons at these prices.  It was the most disappointing start to a vacation, and not the birthday experience I was expecting.

Two members of our party couldn't make the trip due to a health emergency, and we had booked a sail the next day.  I had to ask them to waive the charges since we were inside the cancellation window and they did, but at no point did anyone offer anything at all for their bungling of our check-in.

Our $600 massages 90 minute massages were excellent, and it included 30 minutes of Hale time.  If they had communicated the options more clearly, we would have both opted for 30 additional minutes since that would have included snacks, access to the Ofuro bath and wouldn't have felt so rushed.  

It was adults only, which was fantastic and the rest of our trip was relaxing and restorative.  You only get one chance to make a first impression, and ours was extremely disappointing.","Date of stay: November 2021","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_20"

Everything about this place just oozes tranquility and reflects the desire of a reprieve from live’s cares and worries. 

My wife and I stay two nights and it was honestly fantastic with the atmosphere. We are in now way in a place to do the excursions, but we thoroughly enjoyed the gorgeous and luscious pool. Finally, a pool that doesn’t require you to shower immediately afterward because of all the chlorine. However, the huge rain showers by the pool entrance surrounded in an organize privacy cover created by bamboo. 

The onsens, though hard to find at night, were one of my favorite facets to this Zen hotel. Each one is unique in both its natural surroundings, and in its shape. But you’ll find it hard to leave with the relaxing sounds of birds, water cascading from the surrounding waterfall, and all the greenery. 

The resort itself is absolutely stunning. Honestly, you’d never expect such a place in Hawaii. This plantation looking at times resort has multiples fires roaring at night. All the landscaping seems to have been there since the beginning of time. And the rooms were very cozy and comfortable. Definitely the best toiletries I’ve ever used. 

There were a few things that would have helped to make this place truly top notch, though. 

-Paying $5 for water at every meal. Water is free from the front desk and from the filling station. Why would I pay for water? I get paying for sparkling, but my water costs money only when eating at the resort restaurants? I’ll just bring my water bottle to dinner. 

-If there were better communication on how to actually got about using the resort. For example, we wanted to go hike the trail behind the resort, passed the golf course. However, there were zero signs. It wasn’t really clear. I felt like you’d want people to go out and hike. Let them know where to go. You know they are going to come back hungry and ready to drink. So why not help them out a little more? In addition, the pool requires you to talk with a pool attendant before entering, but there are no signs or nothing said prior to going to the pool. I feel like as a resort you’d want zero guest confusion. Two guest needed to get out of their lounge chairs so that the attendants could put towels down for them. This goes for how to get to the restaurants and the bar lounge. It’s all a little confusing without just a little more information. 

Lastly, the rooms are amazing, but I wish there was some sort of heater in the bathroom and a rack for drying wet clothes. Hanging your pool attire outside on the railing is not a good look, but I also don’t want to drape it over the office chair.  Or do I want it to hang on the bathroom door. The other hooks were for our robes. With a spot to put things to dry, even our shower towel, it would have felt a lot more comfortable. 

It really is a wonderful place to just enjoy nature and feel at peace. There were s few things that, if changed, would make it feel a little less like a resort (like paying $9 for a cup of coffee to go that was supposed to be free). If you have more money than us, then it wouldn’t matter. But for those who can still afford it, I think having that mindset to really help the guests feel like it’s their own private get away really would spur people to take the amazing plane over to rest. 

In summary, my wife and I will be back to relax snd enjoy. This is  a magical place to stay. Now we just need to get a sitter in order to come back…

David","Date of stay: October 2021","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Beautiful grounds, well groomed, and very tranquil. My favorite was the 24 hours outdoor ""onsen,"" which I pretty much had a soak or two late night and early morning. I expected more though.

Hotel room was comfortable but it didn't feel 4 or 5 star; though the size of the room was on a larger size. Staff was sweet and courteous, but not 4 or 5 star level. For example, I'm a tea drinker, and asked to have tea bags well stocked when booking, in email exchanges after booking, and at check in. Yet, I had to constantly ask for more tea bags for the room every day. A time or two, it took almost an hour for a couple tea bags. On a good note, their little tablet to request amenities was a nice and hassle-free touch.

Hale was nice, but again I expected more for the price. Any spa service included 30 minutes (free) of hale time to enjoy steam show, sauna, outdoor rain shower, outdoor ""onsen."" 30 minutes isn't enough to actually enjoy all that though. It was extra fee for additional increment of 30 minutes. By the way, there was no indoor soak tub for only 30 minutes of hale. I felt rush after spa service because there just wasn't enough time to enjoy the hale. They should at least match hale time to service time. For example, 60 minutes massage should come with 60 minutes hale time.

Nobu onsite was nice, but again it wasn't out of this world. The coy pond was a nice zen touch if sit outside. Drinks were vibrantly colored and tasted well. Apparently reservation at Sensei and FS restaurants are only open to guests. Locals aren't allowed according to a couple residents I ran into in town. Even then, I had hard time changing reservation time when I was onsite.

Sunset sail was my least favorite. It sailed from the pier at Four Seasons Lana'i. It's open to FS Lanai guests as well. It was crowded; 25-30 people.

Private charter felt luxurious, but they didn't provide transport if you didn't directly come from HNL airport. For example, if you're already in Honolulu for a day or two, you need your own transport from your location to the hanger. If you arrive to HNL, they provide pick-up from HNL airport to their hanger.

Overall, Sensei is just A-OK for a luxury price. From 2 resorts, I would pick Sensei over FS Lana'i again. Sensei is smaller, quieter, prettier, and doesn't allow minors.","Date of stay: August 2021","Trip type: Traveled solo","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

We were amazed to find it transformed into a tropical oasis.  On our previous Lanai visits would take the shuttle to the beach everyday.  This time, we found ourselves relaxing at the pool and onsen garden.  It was the perfect respite to forget pandemic craziness and the frenzy of urban Honolulu.

You won’t hear any music or people getting ripped at the pool bar instead it’s the rustle of the wind through the trees and a sense of calmness I just can’t explain. 100% book a massage and extend your time in the Hale. The private Hale’s are stunning with your own steam room, sauna, outdoor showers, onsen, soaking tub, and more. We went to the 4S lanai beach one day and felt that was fine.

Forbes Travel Guide recently rated this resort as a 5* ( their highest rating) which we can totally understand. 

From the luxurious Lana’i Air transfer included in the rate and meeting and Tesla Model X transfer from the tiny airport (we were the only passengers) this resorts starts out in style - and never lets up..  
Our beautiful guest room and common areas share a light and airy theme with sharp decor and features ( down to the automated Japanese-style toilet/bidet).   The extensive tropical gardens feature 9 very private soaking tubs hidden along little paths.  Daily room service was provided, carefully timed to coincide with one of our arranged activities.

Before we arrived we were interviewed about what we would like to do: the resort has an extensive range of wellness and adventure activities with a decided focus on wellbeing.  We chose a couples massage, horseback riding, some yoga sessions, and of course golf at the oceanfront Manele course.  Apart from golf, we loved the massage and booked the additional hour in our private Hale( massage building and garden) containing a Japanese wooden soaking tub, 2 saltwater pools, outdoor shower, sauna and a terrace.  The interview also covers restaurant bookings. The resort arranges transfers for everything.  
If you’re wondering what you’re doing next, don’t worry - you receive a program every evening covering your activities etc for the next day. 

We ate breakfast outdoors at the resort restaurant.  We split our dinner reservations between the hotel restaurant, the main Four Seasons on the coast, and at a local Chinese restaurant ‘Chengdu’ in Lanai City. 

The resort had so much to offer from pool, to soaking tubs, massage, fitness & yoga studio etc). 
Thoughts for others:
- This secluded adults-only resort is situated about 1700’ above the main waterfront Four Seasons Resort and the weather is notably cooler (even chilly in the evenings). 
- We loved our ground floor room for easy access via our terrace to the gardens and many of the resort areas","Date of stay: October 2021","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The beautiful landscaping and arrangements of cook pines leading up the driveway to the banyan tree and Botero sculptures greeting you was just the start.  The properties landscape is truly magnificent.  From the Banyan Grove and all the plants in the grove/forest, to the Koi pond outside Nobu to the lake that provides so many areas to relax, reflect or meditate and how can I not mention the onsen pools that are tucked away in their own private garden areas.
The sculptures are an amazing sight to see and are perfectly placed along the grounds.
The rooms are spacious, comfortable, high tech (love the heated toilets), clean, and pretty.  
The gym and fitness/yoga/meditation centers are wonderful...clean, has everything you would need all in a beautiful space.
The salt water pools are the perfect temperature.
The Massage Hales are over and beyond something else...each beautiful hale has an infra-red sauna, steam shower, Japanese soaking tub, Onsen hot pool and another room temperature salt water pool, garden with waterfall, outdoor rain shower and the magic Toto toilets that are throughout the  property.
Finally, the restaurant is amazing!  The food is so delicious not only because of the way it is prepared, but the vegetables and fruit are all so fresh and tasty.  True farm to table.  The lobster, that is farmed on Lanai, is delicious and melts in your mouth.  The roasted chicken is simply cooked but has great flavor and is so tender.  The Japanese breakfast is outstanding and the kolrabi salad is very tasty.  We ate all our meals at the Sensei Nobu (9 days) and never had an average or bad meal.
I should note that the property has done a fantastic job with the health and safety protocols. Having everyone vaccinated allowed us to feel very safe in a public environment.
Everyone (staff and employees) is very nice and service oriented, which is what you expect at the Four Seasons, but at the Sensei the Aloha spirit is definitely added on.

We wanted a beautiful location, a curated experience, wellness activities, delicious yet healthy meal options, togetherness with our adult son and his partner, and a small boutique hotel environment with clearly professional and experienced management. We got all that and more at Sensei, and look forward to returning on a regular basis.  The grounds and art are a special bonus and add to the uniqueness of the experience. 

I loved that we weren't rushed out of our massages and that we had access to the spa hale's amenities for another half hour post massage (steam, sauna, hot tub, cold plunge, indoor and outdoor showers).  I had 3 massages in 6 days with 2 very knowledgeable and professional massage therapists. 

All classes and one-on-one activities had great instructors and were well thought out. The hike to the ridge is appropriately described as moderate--a couple of slightly challenging parts, but very doable for most people. 

Access to the beach was easy via the shuttles, but I only went once because I didn't want to leave the beautiful Sensei grounds.

The staff at the hotel were exceptional, kind and welcoming. The property is immaculate and relaxing. The experiences, from the spa, adventure course and horseback riding are well worth it. Nobu is delightful. Visit Lanai city, the shops and restaurants are well worth your time. 

Unfortunately, several issues arose during our stay that made our experience not at all worth the cost and effort.  The room rate includes a flight to the island and transportation to the hotel. We arrived on time at the Lanai airport, but were left on the tarmac in the midday sun with no one to pick us up. Numerous calls to the hotel were met with skepticism and insistence that our driver was waiting for us in the terminal. There is no terminal. There was no driver waiting. Our very helpful pilots finally found a driver to take us to the hotel after some time.

Despite a great deal of time spent with the experience staff prearranging our trip, many of our reservations and requests were not actually booked, though they were in the itinerary provided by Sensei. Because everything on the island is run by the Four Seasons, you have no option but to book through the hotel. The process seems straightforward. It is not, and we were constantly working to ensure we would have dinner or our next excursion as expected, taking all the relaxation our of our trip. 

We were also very disappointed by our room.  It was large and comfortable, but was located above the restaurant kitchen, which had constant noise in the evening and into the night. It also had an expansive view of a large bright white rooftop and a non-functioning air conditioner. Avoid this room if at all possible. 

Upon departure our final bill was inaccurate and the hotel staff were unable to help us. We were left to try and correct it with staff when we returned home. We were fortunately able to correct the overcharge of several thousand dollars, but it should have never happened. 

In the end, I was most struck by the indifference of the planning and front desk staff to the issues we experienced. The only person to apologize were the accounting folks refunding us a week after our stay. 

We expected so much more from the Four Seasons. We won't be back.","Date of stay: August 2021","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_10"

I'll explain why that was such an issue later. 

The arrival process set the tone for the trip. Having stayed at many 5 star hotels. I am used to being greeted, taken to an intake area where I can sit and provide my credit card and/or passport information while also being served a beverage. That didn't happen here. After departing the shuttle we were told to wait in line, which we did for about 15 mins before finally being helped. I again asked about activities and was instructed to speak with the spa staff. Turns out all of the activities were booked. Being that I booked months in advance, it would have been nice if they had reached out prior to inform me of what was available and asked if I would have liked to reserve. This is again the norm at most 5-star facilities. Same issue for dinner. Nothing was available. I found this out on my own as when I asked about dinner choices with the hotel, 3/4 times I was told to call myself to see what was available.  That left an extremely poor taste in my mouth.  Apparently they don't have a concierge and the staff is too busy to bother being helpful.

It was also extremely difficult to find out what activities were available beyond the spa and yoga classes. No one was ever able to help with that either. While hiking on my own and talking to other guests, I found out that e-biking was an option as well as a jeep rental. Boat tours and rentals are also available at the sister beach property. Not sure why their own staff was never able to explain this. I was only told to check my TV. Had they had a brochure, list, or maybe even human that could explain all the available options, I would have def. booked more activities and spent a lot more $$ with them.

Also, the in-room Ipad is useless. Most requests went unanswered for hours or ignored all together. 

I will say the grounds of the hotel are beautiful and well kept but none of the rooms  (that I saw) offer private balconies.  Dining is great but the options for dinner and lunch are limited. Also,  for breakfast, if you book under AMEX, note that breakfast is capped at $48 p/p. At an expensive resort such as four seasons it adds up fast. For me, the 48 covered most days but it is a bit annoying to have to think about costs while on a ""relaxing spa getaway"" Would be nice if breakfast was just simply included period, which is what is stated at the time of booking.

Also, I did book a couples massage (about 2-3 months prior to arrival). The spa hale's are huge and really nice to have to yourself. I don't think the 30 mins that comes with the massage however is enough time. With that said I didn't really think the $450 x2 for a 60 minute massage was worth it. Also didn't come with any tea or amenities like at most spas. I specifically requested tea after my service and was told that water was the only option.....$900 bucks and you can't provide a cup of tea?!

Book this hotel if you just want a beautiful setting and don't mind having to figure out everything on your own and service is not important to you.","Date of stay: July 2021","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

The literature assured us the resort offers regular shuttle services between the Sensai and the beach resort. This is NOT true, and nothing about the experience has been peaceful, free spirited or relaxing. Everything EVERYTHING must be scheduled. You need reservations for a shuttle that operates hourly if you  want to leave the very secluded resort. The shuttle is almost always full. You are almost always stuck. 

If you want to eat, you must have a reservation . No coffee bar or light bite options. Formal dining is our only option. When we checked in our room was not ready per the 3:00 pm check in.  I had to reach out to the resort several times to arrange transportation from the airport. 

We wanted to play tennis - guess what - must make reservations for a court of course and …..  the courts are booked! We wanted to go to the driving range one evening, but it closed at 5:00 pm and their were no shuttles available until 5:30 to take us there! 

The people working at the hotel are kind. They are doing the best they can but it is so understaffed and they have stifling rules that won’t allow them to assist us.

Advice - only stay at Sensai if you don’t have any desire to be spontaneous or embrace “island time”. Don’t stay at Sensai if you want to spend time at the beach resort - it is such a pain getting there from scheduling shuttles (the first one leaves at 2:30 pm mst). 

Make reservations for every dinner we’ll before you arrive. Rent a car if you are lucky enough to grab one do the few that is available on the island so you aren’t stuck at Sensai. 

We travel a lot. We have stayed at many 5 star resorts around the world and Sensai is as beautiful as any we have visited. The rooms are lovely and the bedding is lush. All the said, we will definitely not be coming back to Sensai. We truly have felt trapped and forced to be so scheduled and regimented - the logistics are a big problem and  it takes the fun and relaxation out of the entire experience.","Date of stay: July 2021","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_20"

But it fell far short on the service side, which was shocking at a Four Seasons property.  There were exceptions, but the general vibe (particularly at the front office level) was oddly off, cold and unwelcoming.  It was absolutely impossible to book anything - phones rang endlessly, requests were ignored, no efforts seemed to be made at all to accommodate guests.  (I was told the yoga classes were fully booked during our stay, but I ended up walking in and the teacher was happy to have us).  When we were moving down to the Lanai beach resort (another Four Seasons property), we were ignored and made to wait for an hour for a bus (that had no place for our luggage) while multiple Teslas sat there unused.  I know there are staffing challenges post-pandemic, etc., but it was a totally different feel at the beach resort, which ran like a Four Seasons should.  (We couldn’t always get appointments there either, but efforts were made to help).  Sensei could be spectacular, but the service issue is real - bad enough that we’d be unlikely to return.

One driver told us that he only stops at Lanai City when instructed to do so. Another driver told us that he always stops in Lanai City-obviously not true. Another staffer said we needed to ask at the front desk. Yet another staffer said that you only had to request at the front desk if you ate at that restaurant. We had no idea who to believe. When you call the hotel it rings 20 times, then is transferred to the other resort, where they told us we called the wrong resort!!

Paradise.  Words cannot do justice....","After what had been a very difficult 18 months (Cancer. Covid. Chauvin) the wife and I decided we were entitled to the vacation of a lifetime. After some pretty serious initial issues with arrangements for our activities on the island, we were set.

From our very moments leaving the aircraft everything was just…amazing.
“Chris” was there at the airport to help us with our bags and give us a lift to the resort property in a private car (Tesla Model X). On the way he gave a very nice overview of the island and its history. Once we arrived he then gave us a brief tour of the resort. The entire time, from helping us with our bags to handling our check in, he was both charming and professional. 
Our room was beyond words – an upgrade provided by the Property Manager “David”, presumably as compensation for the initially difficulties I had with making the arrangements, along with perhaps empathy for our personal story behind the trip. Really, I would post pictures of the room, but I think that might would be unfairly setting expectations for those who are not able to stay in a suite. Suffice to say it was the most magnificent hotel room / suite we have ever stayed in, and we’ve stayed in a few decent properties, including other Four Seasons. So fantastic was the room that we decided to extend our stay within hours of having arrived. In addition to providing us with the suite, David went out of his way REPEATEDLY to make sure our stay was fantastic. Really the epitome of courteous and professional, and his efforts were very much appreciated, which could be said about all the property staff we encountered.

This was demonstrated by the efforts made by “Edith” in the front office. Because of all the mish mash and confusion with traveling to Hawaii at that time (pretty much right after the island opened), our change in itinerary created a problem with reserved rental car back in Honolulu. Seems that while we were good with having a reservation for 3 days, 2 days was somehow impossible, despite it being a subset of the 3. Nothing I could do online, nothing I could do talking to a customer service agent. Edith? Apparently she called the branch, and would not budge until she spoke with the branch manager, who mage the change to my reservation. This was someone who worked in the front office of the hotel…who simply would not give up until she was able to solve a problem for a guest. How can you beat that??

The property itself…absolutely beyond words. I am not one for “natural beauty”…I was wholly unimpressed with Niagara Falls, for example, but this resort grounds took my breath away.  Just…absolutely gorgeous. And the art work…I guess Larry (Ellison…owner of 98% of the island and the two Four Seasons properties) knows his art…because it too is just amazing, and I am not someone who is into art at all. There was just no denying to beauty of it all though.

Our guest experiences were superb as well. We did the snorkel tour on the private yacht…amazing boat, fantastic crew, unbelievable snorkeling at the best spot on the island. We also did the Jeep tour…what a blast…and our guide was just fantastic. Showed us all the most beautiful sights, gave us a fantastic history lesson on the island, and had great sense of humor as well.

It was, as planned, a vacation for a lifetime. Not cheap, oh so not cheap, but worth every dime. We are committed to going back next year just to experience it all again…","Date of stay: May 2021","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The Sensei staff also offered top level wellness and fitness classes of all kinds that made those meals largely guilt free and added to our overall relaxation and rejuvenation. The property itself is lush and unique, filled with gorgeous artwork and splendid flora and fauna. The concierges all were smiling and helpful in the extreme.  If there was an asterisk to the visit it came in the form of a number of glitches on the part of the Four Seasons front desk and housekeeping staff. Upon check in itself they couldn’t get their credit card reader to work correctly for some time, the traditional short tour around the property was omitted, a neighbor’s room service was erroneously delivered to/left in our room and charged to our account, a room change mid-stay resulted in our bags being left behind, and lastly weeks after our stay ended we were mistakenly overcharged by 2 nights. Needless to say this is not the kind of experience that we have had with Four Seasons around the world over the last two decades, so perhaps it is just a post-pandemic start up issue, but worth noting.

Absolutely Superb.","Extraordinary stay at Sensei in Lanai.   Everything — from the property, the facilities, the dining, and of course the service — exceeded our high expectations.

The facilities — the grounds, the brilliant  flora and fauna, the extensive, museum-quality modern sculpture (including numerous Boteros and an immense Jaume Plensa, apparently from the personal collection of Sensei owner and Oracle CEO, Larry Ellison), the vast, Zen-like swimming pool, and the totally unique “Onsen Garden” (including 10 private Japanese-style soaking hot tubs nestled within a small forest on the property) — are the most remarkable and memorable that we have experienced.   Sensei and Four Seasons have created an environment of beauty, nature, refinement and modernity that is unparalleled.   The colors and variety of flowers and plants are simply breathtaking.   Walking the grounds feels like you are visiting and experiencing a beautiful and stimulating art exhibit at an impeccably-curated botanical garden.

The service is also extraordinary.   Everyone on staff is friendly and focused on ensuring guests have a wonderful and relaxing experience.   And particular kudos and appreciation to resort GM, David Emig, both for building and leading such a great team that clearly cares about the resort and its guests and for his exemplary personal attention to ensuring Sensei guests are well cared for and have a great stay.   Our stay was part of our wedding anniversary celebration and David and his Sensei team — including Maureen, Edith and many others — went above and beyond for us.

The dining is excellent, with nice variety and friendly, caring and refined service, and the fitness center — which has plenty of space and is never crowded — has exceptional equipment for fitness-focused guests like us, including four Pelotons, about 10 Woodway treadmills and two water rowers.

The wellness classes are great, and many are included, including a great morning stretching class with a very nice and knowledgeable leader named Eduardo, and a very relaxing meditation class with Nico.

Housekeeping is also impeccable and rooms are kept immaculately.

Also worth noting that the overall feel and experience are much more intimate and uncrowded than at larger luxury resorts.   There are less than 100 rooms and there is never a need to “stake out” the best poolside seating, etc., which is appreciated and enhances the feeling of restfulness and relaxation.

Finally, don’t miss the extraordinary four-mile Koloiki Ridge hike, which begins at the edge of the property, winds through the Lanai mountain forests and ends up at a spectacular vast mountain top view of the Pacific Ocean and an immense, verdant ravine.

Bravo, Sensei and Four Seasons, and frankly, bravo Larry Ellison.  We look forward to our next visit.","Date of stay: July 2021","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The rooms are spacious, modern, and relaxing.  The spa hales are the most beautiful so experiences I’ve seen.  The pool is huge and luxurious… never crowded, and always magical and beautiful.  The private onsen baths are little oases in the hillside.  The place is just magical.

Food service is gracious and warm.  Food selections could use a bit more variety from night to night, but the quality of every meal was top notch and thoughtful.  They even did a special tasting menu for my partner on his birthday, which was kind and — again — thoughtful.

Only missteps were arrival and departure.  From Air Lana’i, my partner and I were picked up by someone who drove us to the hotel.  When we arrived, we learned she was also our front desk clerk.  My partner and I were presented with two leis immediately upon entering, but apparently they had only prepared for a man and a woman to arrive rather than a same-sex couple, since they apparently have different leis for men and women (seems unnecessarily gendered these days, but ok…).  It took a minute for them to give my partner the “right” lei, but whatever apparently strict lei rules they were using.  An unforced error (like having only men’s and women’s slippers in the rooms unless you request otherwise), but not a huge deal.  
When checking in, we asked if any FHR upgrades were available, but there weren’t (a too typical experience with FHR these days).  Fine, we had booked a suite, so no expectation.  The suite was still being cleaned, and she suggested we have a drink at the bar.  Not a huge deal, but it was past check in time and we asked how long it would be and she shrugged and said “I’m not sure, housekeeping didn’t say”.  We stared blankly at each other, and it was very awkward.  We didn’t feel like a cocktail, so we just sat in the lobby until it was ready.

Then, on leaving for the Four Seasons Lana’i after checkout, there wasn’t any private car service offered to us or assistance with our bags.  We were instead booked on the large shuttle  bus that takes everyone down instead, and just had to hold onto our luggage in the aisle.

These awkward checkin/checkout experiences paled in comparison to the glory that is the Sensei.  I look forward to returning, and hopefully by then they will have cleaned up some of these easy fixes.","Date of stay: June 2021","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

And to end a year and 4 months of lockdown.
I wanted peace and quiet, as it had been a very stressful time, I love children, but I was seeking quiet and serenity, so kept searching for Spa Resorts that were adult only- voila! Also, I’d stayed at the Four Seasons in Moscow, and St Petersburg Russia, and Santa Monica, and really loved their professionalism and care of guests.
I loved it here! I honestly didn’t want to leave, and pondered how I could stay in my room for the rest of my life, or buy a home on Lana’i! The resort is in the mountains, floating in the clouds and mists, so cooler by day, and especially by night. Also, the sunsets are beautiful. If you want heat, and the beach, the complimentary shuttle will take you to their sister property and back, and easy trip under 30 minutes, and giving you a tour of the island. (Make sure you reserve in advance.)The other property has multiple restaurants, and access (with a bit of a walk) to a huge, beautiful beach, and is lively, with the sounds of children and families everywhere.
Back at Sensei- it is peace. Beautifully renovated recently, in light colors, with lots of natural light throughout, with two huge fireplaces in the lobby, one delightful restaurant (that also has outdoor seating, where you can sit by brooks filled with fish, and gaze at the beautiful flora and fauna), and serves mainly Japanese inspired, healthful, fresh cuisine. Everyone there is so friendly and helpful. There is a small, elegant salon, and the spas, instead of being one large building with small treatment rooms- there are multiple completely private Hale spa buildings, each with treatment areas, bathrooms, changing areas, an outdoor hot tub, plus cold water soaking tub, and outdoor shower, all surrounded by brooks, trees and flowers- absolutely breathtaking and unique! There is am enormous salt water swimming pool, that was my Heaven, with lovely staff that provide you with chair covers, towels, water, and food and drink until 5:30. The pool is surrounded by three large jacuzzis as well as an outdoor shower. There are tennis courts, a walking distance ranch, with horse back riding, a beautiful hike viewing enormous pine trees, to “Koloiki Ridge”, an Adventure park, zip lining and putting greens. There is also a gym, to work out, and a classroom for fitness classes, plus a yoga building. In the hills, above, there are multiple hot pools, hidden amongst the brooks and flowers, where you can soak, while gazing up at the stars at night. The rooms are beautifully appointed, light and airy, with balconies to have breakfast on, or sip a glass of bubbly while watching the sun go down. There is also a lovely gift shop in the lobby, with all kinds of hats, bathing suits, sunglasses, jewelry etc.During the day, in the lobby, there were classes in Hawaian, and in the musical instruments used in Hawaiian dance and story telling. The tiny town of Lana’i City, is a fairly short and pleasant walk away, if you want to try a restaurant there, or need to pick up a few things from the stores. And there is a beautiful church, located just off the driveway, where you can hear sermons and singing in Hawaian on Sundays. One of my favorite areas was the cozy bar, with the fireplace going, and seating inside or out, where there are fire-pits to sit around at night.
Upon arriving at HNL Airport, a greeter from Four Seasons affiliated “Lanai Air” will greet you and take you to a car, where you’re driven to the Lounge and Airport for Lanai Air. There, you’ll board a beautiful “Polaris PC12” and fly to Lana’i, then be driven to the resort. There used to be a Four Seasons Lounge, at Honolulu Airport, to relax in before departing home, but apparently it has closed permanently, which I think is a shame. , I adored this resort, so much so, that I tried to extend my stay, but my airline tickets made it difficult.

Food is expensive but that is to be expected . We prefer the food choices at Manele and took the shuttle down for dinner. The current pricing structure of the two resorts has changed dramatically. Sensei recently raised prices on the non-suite rooms by about 10% so the range is approximately $700-800 dollars. Manele prices have exploded to a garden view room depending on the time of year being upwards of $2,300 a night. I paid around $900 in 2019. Not sure why the crazy increase unless Covid occupancy restrictions have temporarily caused it. All things being equal Manele is my preference after the remodel but my wife prefers Sensei.

I've already booked my second stay!!  

My stay at Sensei was a surreal journey for which I will never forget. I must admit, I wondered if I had made the right decision to choose the Sensei Lānaʻi, A Four Seasons Resort property over the Four Seasons Beach Resort Lanai but I am so thankful I choose Sensei because it’s incredible post-card like gardens, waterfalls, and sensei guides, in meditation, personal training, mindfulness, nutrition and yoga are world-class. It is first and foremost a wellness center that is housed at Four Seasons property merging the best of both worlds to create an unimaginable, data-driven, wellness center which brought me incredible breakthroughs, healing, and peace. And after a year of the pandemic, I think we all need this incredible gift! 

I have to say a huge thank you to the entire team at the Sensei property for their kindness, attentiveness, and follow-through especially the Sensei team Jody, Dolybel, and of course Rianna who made my experience world-class! 

Here are my thoughts on the Dos & Don’ts between the two Four Seasons properties: 

- DO purchase the Optimal Wellness Program at Sensei property verses opting to take all of their free classes during your stay. Why? Because, they are usually all booked up by the guests, and most importantly, because you get teamed up with the most qualified (Masters degrees and up!) and dedicated guides whose aim is to help you create new goals and intentions for your life. Going to Sensei but not participating in their wellness programs is like going to a waterpark but leaving your swim suit at home; you’re going to miss a lot (the majority) of the Sensei experience. 

- DO setup nutrition classes with Nikola because she’s a badass in every sense of the word. She has a Master’s degree in Global Public Health Nutrition and it shows! Most importantly, she is phenomenal at taking large, complex, data-driven research into manageable, digestible bites (see what I did there ;-)

- DO expect the best food of your life at both properties. 

- DO expect a more traditional beach resort experience at the Four Seasons beach resort. I think it’s crucial for guests to understand so they can make the right decision based on the intention of their trip.

- Do expect a traditional (and exceptional) culinary experiences at the Four Seasons beach resort where they have the more traditional Nobu Lanai restaurant with all the traditional Nobu fixings including One Forty steakhouse which is phenominal (ask for Ms. Loretta who is the hardest working GM I’ve ever met at a restaurant and do try the Le Vie en Rose which is a delectable strawberry Prosecco cocktail). 

- DO expect to take the luxury motorcoach when staying at Sensei to go down and explore the Four Seasons beach resort including it’s beautiful restaurants and stunning views. The trip is 21 minutes between the two resorts and it is the one of the most scenic views of the whole island. You will meet guests and possibly get stopped by a family of hundreds of deer that regularly cross throughout the island like I did which was surreal as I didn’t expect to see so many beautiful animals that live on the island. The bus leaves every hour from Sensei and every half hour from Four Seasons beach resort. The last bus ride leaves at 10PM giving you plenty of time to be at the beach resort and then heading back up to Sensei at night. 

- DO expect the entire staff of both resorts to do their absolute best to accommodate your needs. 

- DO expect world-class travel to the island via Lanai Air, a private jet that will take you from Honolulu to Lanai in 30 minutes. 

- DO take an afternoon to check out The Views restaurant for lunch which is on the golf course. Don’t worry if you’re not interested in golfing, the views and food of this restaurant are not to be missed. It’s between the two resorts and people often miss out on this restaurant so plan it into your trip! The shuttle will take you! 

- DO ask for Dolybel, Jody, and Rianna during your stay at Sensei to build out your Sensei experience as they are the finest, most attentive ladies on the property! It’s the people that make Sensei so incredible and you must 

- DO try the Sunset sail cruise but be weary if you get sea sick easily. The views of the island are, you guessed it, breathtaking and should be seen on water. It's also a great opportunity to meet other guests with cocktails and food served! 

- DON’T book a stay at Sensei if you’re looking for a beach resort. Simple as that. The pricing at Sensei is more “reasonable” than the Four Seasons beach resort which I think makes it more tempting to book at this resort but if you set those expectations of a standard Four Seasons beach resort, you will be disappointed. Don’t set yourself up to be disappointed and choose whether you’re looking for quite, peaceful, wellness resort or a true authentic Four Seasons beach resort. 

- DON’T expect the Nobu by Sensei to be a traditional Nobu restaurant. The Nobu on the Sensei property is built on the  principles of a wellness program and nutrition so it doesn’t have all of the traditional offerings of a New York/LA Nobu. It’s the reason you’ve chosen a wellness resort verses a beach resort so do your homework and make sure to clarify your intention for your trip. 

- DON”T expect to stay at the Four Seasons beach resort and expect to visit the incredible pools, spa, and Hala services at Sensei because they’re really not readily available which is why I will always stay at Sensei and visit Four Seasons for some incredible food and views! 

- DON’T expect that either property will be able to schedule every dinner and extracurricular activities (i.e. horseback riding, spa services, classes etc) when you arrive.  The will do their best but it’s best to plan out your schedule prior to your arrival by speaking with your travel agent or calling the property and speaking with their Sensei guides to build out your program. The majority of guests that stay at Sensei plan their stay out so they can get the most out of their experience. 

I hope this helps you plan your next trip to Lanai and this incredible wellness resort that is Sensei! It was a life-altering experience for me and I hope it will be for you too!","Date of stay: June 2021","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

However, whereas most other Four Seasons experiences have surprise and delight moments sprinkled throughout the stay, here there were surprises, but none very delightful. As others have said, the marketing is very much an over promise and under deliver experience here. Whether it is the shuttle buses instead of Teslas that are supposed to courier you around, the lack of sushi at Nobu despite a sushi bar being built as part of the restaurant, the unchanging and uninspired food menus, the opacity of activities (daily calendar not uploaded to iPad or tv in room or handed out at check in and pretty much booked up anyway), lack of pre-arrival info or assistance with reservations ( we were very persistent so had meals at both resorts and in toner reserved a month in advance but some couples were not so lucky and actually took all their meals at the bar or in the lobby if you can believe it), on and on. It is the little things here that add up and make this an experience far apart from a typical Four Seasons stay. Sad given the island, the grounds and the potential.

However, the overall experience is diminished by lackluster service and a questionable focus on wellness. This transformed what was supposed to be a restorative trip to simply a beautiful hotel with a frustrating experience from start to finish. 

We chose the Sensei resort due to its heavy branding as a full ""wellness retreat"". We stayed for 4 nights, selecting the ""Guided Sensei Experience"" that promises discussions with a ""pre-arrival specialist"" (see below), a ""personally matched Sensei Guide"" (we were never directed to a guide even after arrival), and ""proprietary technology"" (who knows that this was supposed to be? a wristband key?).

After booking, I was never contacted by a pre-arrival specialist. I sent multiple emails, left 3 voicemails (no one ever answered my calls), and after couple weeks of trying was finally able to get ahold of someone. When we finally were able to (3+ weeks prior to arrival), many of the requested activities were already booked. We ended up with a fairly random assortment of classes where my wife was often on the waitlist, and even when she was called up off the waitlist, no one notified us. After we arrived at the hotel, we found ourselves fully self-directing our activities and our schedule; there's no ""guided"" aspect to the resort at all. We've stayed at several fully guided experiences with other companies and had a far better experience.

Overall, it is a great hotel with five-star high end appointments and gardens, but three star mediocre service and wellness, and a complete lacking of ""guided"" services.

A few nits:
- Wellness class was poorly taught. We took one class and found the agenda so rushed and poorly delivered that we cancelled our remaining classes. 
- No Tesla rides. They message everywhere that they'll shuttle you around in Tesla's (including in an email 2 hrs before pickup), but none of our rides were in a Tesla. All were in shared mini-buses. I don't care too much about this, but clearly false advertising.
- Wifi is weak across the resort; don't plan on remote working well.
- Dining options are extremely limited (assume the same menu for 4 days unless you go to the other Four Seasons). 
- The scheduling staff seemed uninformed of some activities (e.g. we received mixed messaging on what the Ofuru bath experience contained)
- Sustainability is very hit or miss. In some aspects, they show care (e.g. refillable water bottles); in others, they show completely disregard (individually packed condiments, daily towel replenishment
- We did 3 Hale experiences, and they were all different. In two of the units, the cold plunge pool was 2 ft deep (making it hard to ""plunge""), whereas another had a 4 ft. deep one. 
- The massages were very expensive, and very average. The hale's were at least beautiful.","Date of stay: April 2021","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_20"

Town is just a short 10-15 minute walk and the locals are very friendly. The only complaint we had was that our room, while selecting the deluxe room, overlooked the employee parking lot (although there was a lot of foliage, so it was not an obvious view of the lot) and the Peloton bikes in the fitness center were damaged and would not connect to the internet (we are avid Peloton users and were very excited to see the Peloton equipment in the fitness center).

The flight experience from Oahu also made the travel feel easy and special. The rooms were bright, luxurious, and immaculate. I felt a sense of peace from the moment we checked in.

The one recurring disappointment was the level of service, especially for a property of this caliber.  They seemed to be understaffed in every area (front desk, restaurant, pool service), but the resort didn’t feel busy.  We often found ourselves looking for or waiting for someone to help us. We also had trouble reserving the yoga classes we were really looking forward to.  I understand that COVID creates capacity restrictions, but every class we inquired about was “booked”, and that was with over a week’s notice.  We also weren’t able to get a dinner reservation until after 8pm, which is a challenge when dining options are so limited.

Our service at Nobu was epically slow. I live in Hawaii and expect things to be a more relaxed pace, but this was unacceptable (seated for 15+ minutes before greeted or given water).  We struggled to get shuttle reservations to the beach property due to limited availability.  I was also surprised when we returned to our room after dinner and there’d been no turn-down service.  I later saw that it could be requested, but I at least expected them to come get our dirty dishes.  We could hear staff talking loudly in the hallway after 9pm and beeping noises that sounded like radios. 

These are all things that would disappoint me at any property, but definitely came in below my expectations for this Four Seasons.  I would love to return for the gorgeous property and rooms, but the quality of service will have me thinking twice. I really hope it’s something they can improve, because it will be a true gem if they can turn it around.","Date of stay: February 2021","Trip type: Traveled with friends","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

Well how wrong I was.  

From the moment I arrived at Honolulu airport, everything was ""taken care of"".  A staff member of Lanai Air was there to greet me, helped with the luggage, a quick 10 min private transfer to Lanai Air private hangar where the waiting lounge already made me feel so relaxed.  Then a quick transfer on Lanai Air (extra fun when you're the only guest on the jet).  Once landed on Lanai, everything was seamless.  The Tesla from the airport to the property was a nice touch but once you arrive at the property, on the mountain, is where the magic starts.

This is a place where everyone bends over backwards.  From David the Resort Manager who welcomed me so warmly to the professional staff at Nobu and the very-knowledgeable instructors (I took a lot of classes!), all of these people made my stay a most memorable one.  

The property sits on a massive ground; so lush and filled with beautiful trees and plants.  If you're looking for peace and tranquility, you'll get this in abundance.  Yet the staff were always there and available to help you with any queries - never intrusive.  The rooms, decent size and very nicely decorated, exude warmth throughout.  A lot of artwork and sculptures scattered all over the property and in little nooks and crannies.

The best team at this property, for me, are the Nobu team.  Whether it's for breakfast, lunch or dinner, they are attentive, warm and approachable yet remain professional at all times.  I'm an early bird - hit the gym at 5am and breakfast at 6am.  Not surprisingly, I was, almost always, the only one there for breakfast which allowed me to have really nice informal conversations with the staff.  From things to do on the island to recommendation on what to have for breakfast (and they are so flexible with making changes).  I probably tried almost everything on the menu during my stay.  For dinner though the black cod miso is a must.  Dinner is a lot more lively than lunch but the team would make the effort to find a quiet corner for me without fail.

The ""Wellness"" consultants and instructors are amazing too.  Whether it's yoga (a few different types), open sky meditation (do the one at night - it's amazing) or other experiences (and there are plenty to choose from), everyone is a subject matter expert in what they do...yet they also pamper you like no other.  Their main focus is your wellness.  And speaking of being pampered - their spa  (privately accommodated in a hale) is, hands down, the best spa set up I've experienced ever...and I've been to a lot of spas.  You have your own hale/villa that you can enjoy after the treatment complete with outdoor shower, hot tub and sauna/steam room (inside the hale).  The massage itself was out of this world.

As I said in the beginning, I wonder if I was going to enjoy staying on a mountain in Hawaii.  The truth is, I didn't even miss the beach.  If you want to, you can always go to their sister property on the beach - 30 mins away and they have a shuttle service.  I went down there once on New Year's Eve to watch the fireworks but apart from that, I was more than happy to spend my time on the grounds at Sensei.  Whether at the spa, in one of their classes, by the pool or simply.....do nothing.

Was it perfection?  No - a couple of details here and there but nothing that would take away the immense joy I had staying at Sensei (eg:  I had a question about my folio and the Front Desk Team didn't respond to my email - I did provide feedback directly to the management).  

Would I recommend Sensei?  Absolutely and I'd go back in a heart beat.","Date of stay: December 2020","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I have stayed at other Four Seasons where you feel staff is very knowledgeable and always just a glance away and we just did not get that feeling here.
The Pros:
•	Meet and greet in Oahu and transfer to the small plane was great and a really nice perk for staying at Sensei 
•	The room was beautiful with nice touches like a Dyson dryer and huge TV
•	The Island and setting are spectacular and very peaceful 
The Cons:
•	Staff seemed new and a little under trained – some did not know answers to simple questions about pool service, booking a shuttle to the beach or activities – I assume this will get better as time goes on
•	NOBU is an amazing experience (although they did run out of a few items) – But when it is your only food option, it can get old for breakfast, lunch and dinner every day (the shuttle to the beach hotel is 20-30 mins to get access to other restaurants) 
•	Pool was very cold and understaffed – almost always we were moving umbrellas and setting up chairs with no assistance

The highlight is definitely the private spas (Hales). Worth going for a few days just for that.

The restaurant is good, although it gets a bit repetitive after a few days. Food was small portion, so I just started ordering two entrees for each meal, which ended up being about right.

During my stay, the wellness concept was poorly executed. Over five days I didn’t notice anything other than the very standard practices available in basically any major city. Think yoga, meditation, sound baths, etc. I wasn’t actually able to do any of those activities though due to them being full. Ultimately, nothing was personalized. Don’t count on any pre-arrival coordination with the resort. Their classes were basically assigned to us at random despite multiple attempts at getting ahold of them prior to arrival.

The resort is run by Four Seasons, but Sensei is a separate organization with its own staff. I generally found the “Sensei desk” to be slow and unhelpful to the point of absurdity. If you decide to book a stay at the resort, do everything in your power to confirm every activity before you arrive.

From a value perspective, I found the resort to be reasonably priced. And with the constant unavailability of experiences, spending money was actually kind of difficult to do.

The resort claims that there are shuttles between the Sensei property and the beach, but they require advance booking. There is basically no room for spontaneity.

It’s hard to know which of these issues are due to Covid or recent shutdowns, so I would anticipate improvement in these issues in the future. Definitely a lot of potential.","Date of stay: March 2021","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Prior to our stay, we were asked to fill out a comprehensive questionnaire regarding our needs, desires, etc. Upon arrival, we could not help noticing the beautiful grounds and incredible statues /sculptures that were located throughout the grounds.  We reserved a deluxe room, and following an efficient check-in, walked to our room. The first thing we noted was only half of our luggage was delivered to the room.  Also, the flowers I ordered for our anniversary was not delivered as requested. Plus, the room was adjacent to what appeared to be the HVAC fans and maintenance equipment, not conducive to a quiet/romantic stay. We asked to be moved, and after a bit, were assigned a quieter room. However, we had to lug all our luggage to the new room. Also, endeavoring to call anyone from hotel phone, regarding missing luggage or flowers was nearly impossible.  This was to be the case throughout our stay, defaulting to the main desk to get anything resolved. We also endeavored several times via e-mail to secure a dinner reservation at Nobu (wonderful if you can get in). Never did receive any response at the end of the day (so unlike Four Seasons). There is a neat iPad in the room that suggests one can secure additional soap, set up activities, etc. None of which ever came to fruition, as we never heard anything from anyone or received the requested extra soaps. We also met with the concierge re an archery or skeet shooting for the following day and never heard anything about it (Despite being told someone would contact us for a time). Lastly, despite an e-mail citing someone would contact us regarding our questionnaire,  we NEVER heard from anyone re the lengthy questionnaire we originally filled out! What was the purpose of even completing it?  Don't get me wrong, the property is beautiful, the private hot tubs located throughout the property are the bomb and the food is great (although expensive and there are no alternatives to Nobu on the property); that said, if you are expecting Four Seasons service, lower your expectations.

The service was also impeccable. From the moment we arrived, we were warmly greeted at the airport with private transportation to the property. Within 24 hours, everyone on the property we encountered seemed to know our name and were incredibly friendly and helpful. Every encounter we had, whether it was food service, room service, front desk, bell desk or transportation, the staff is attentive and authentic. 

We particularly enjoyed a lot of the activities associated with the property, which I highly recommend you book in advance. Highlights for us include the horseback riding with Molly, as there are stables across the street also owned by the four seasons and modestly priced. The skeet shooting had to be one of the best in the world, with a seven station experience built up into the valleys within the mountains, and overlooking the ocean. Dennis, who is been doing the oversight of the skeet shooting for 23 years was incredibly patient, helpful and professional. Absolutely a level 10 experience. I also recommend you book activities in the adventure park, where my wife and I had wonderful physical as well as teambuilding challenge. There’s so much to do, that we didn’t even have time for the yoga on the property itself, which people said they enjoyed. Because of Covid limiting occupancy, I highly recommend you book these activities in advance. The gym is also in impeccable condition and beautiful, generously equipped with plenty of options for any exercise desire, including four peloton bikes.

The guest room itself was probably one of the most comfortable we’ve ever stayed in, and the bed and pillows were luxurious. Television screens in the bedroom and the sitting area are wonderful for viewing local programming, which includes cable and assortment of movies at a reasonable price. My wife and I also enjoyed that there are no children allowed at the property as this is a very adult location, but really nothing for young kids to do. It’s the kind of break you will want to consider with your significant other, for a special occasion or with special friends.","Date of stay: January 2021","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The hotel has a warm ambiance. I find some Four Seasons a bit austere, but the Sensei Lana'i, with its (New England?) style feels welcoming and engaging.

 The classes. The instructors are knowledgeable and share the same philosophy. They don't push -- they inspire.

The gardens. Just stunning lovely to walk through.

The manager David. He seems to make it his business to greet all the new guests, and, how can you not like someone who lets you get a lift up the hill in a shuttle (after biking the Maui loop), and, even supplies a couple cold coconut waters to boot?

The bartender.  Many a conversation comparing notes about kids and spouses. 

The masseuses.  Perhaps the best massage I've had and a lovely hale as its locale to boot.

Lana'i Air. Pretty special to arrive in that fashion.

No big golf course.  Ok, I'm showing my bias, and of course there's a stunning golf course not far away, but I liked the fact that most people were there for the classes, the ambiance, and so on.

Lana'i.  Just a lovely, peaceful island.

The adventure center.  We got as much therapy (counseling)  as adventure, I think. An unexpected bonus.

Shipwreck beach.  It was fun to ride down there and enjoy the unspoiled beaches. Well, except for the shipwreck, which doesn't spoil but supplies context. 

Good scuba diving.  Probably the best we've experienced in Hawaii. Fun underground structures to dive through, plenty of fish, good coral. 

The folks who work there seem to enjoy it.  It creates a nice family feeling. And ""everyone"" knows your name (especially if you stay there as long as we did).

We look forward to returning. The Sensei Lanai is truly special.  Thanks to everyone there for making it so.","Date of stay: January 2021","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Ricky and his crew on the sunset cruise were gracious, and dolphins that swam in front of the boat were amazing.

After booking, I was contacted by an Experience Specialist to schedule flights, activities and dining. The Specialist was very helpful and completed everything within a few email chains.

The flight from Honolulu was included in my stay. I flew on Lanai Air, which departs from a private terminal, so no lines, TSA, etc. - a huge relief. The aircraft was a small prop plane that felt brand new. Upon arrival at LNY, I was transported to the hotel on a Tesla Model X.

I had previously stayed at the Lodge at Koele over 20 years ago. The renovated Sensei has the same structure, but a much brighter interior look and feel compared to the dark and rustic lodge. The landscaping of the surrounding gardens has been changed completely, and it's impressive.

COVID precations seemed thorough. My temperature was taken pre-flight, every day at the hotel, as well as when I visited the sister Four Seasons Manele. All staff wore masks, and guests were encouraged to as well, but this wasn't strictly enforced. Most interactions were touch-less, and hand sanitizer is provided everywhere. The Teslas were cleaned after each guest and hand sanitizer was provided prior to entering the shuttle between Four Seasons resorts. I barely saw any other guests (even though I was told it was a busy weekend), which alleviated any COVID concerns. I felt completely safe the whole time I was there. The only lapse I found was a half-used bottle of OFF that was in my room's dresser. This was presumably left by a prior guest, and suggests that the room could have used a better cleaning.

A few other highlights:
Pros:
-The experience at Sensei is so different from other, more touristy hotels. The hotel is small so you don't run into crowds, which adds to the peaceful ambiance.
-The hotel grounds are spectacular! I spent hours walking through these. The landscaping also changes throughout the gardens, so you see a variety of plants/trees, many of which have informative labels.
-Jacuzzis (called onsens) are tucked into the landscape. You access them through narrow paths in the gardens, which gives the feeling of an actual onsen experience in a Japanese forest.
-The hotel lobby is spacious with tons of seating, a fireplace, and tasteful decorations.
-The front desk and restaurant/bar staff were attentive and helpful. The hotel has a large team of staff working round the clock, and I usually saw more staff than guests.
-The rooms were spacious and well-appointed. Each room has a balcony - on the first floor the balcony gives you direct access to the surrounding gardens.
-The Nobu Sensei restaurant was excellent. Unlike other Nobu locations which tend to have large menus, the Sensei Nobu focused on a handful of dishes, many of which are not found on the classic Nobu menu.
-Golf at the sister Manele Bay was amazing. The views are unmatched and the course was impeccably maintained.
-The clay shooting experience I had was awesome. It was a nice contrast to the relaxed Sensei experience, and my host, Frankie (sp?), was helpful, encouraging, and enthusiastic.

Cons:
-Air conditioning in the room was either very weak or not working. It was especially hot during the day, but bearable during the cooler evenings. The hotel's maintenance staff suggested that I ""open a window"", which was not especially helpful, nor ideal, as my room faced the noisy driveway.
-Internet was slow, even though I paid for premium Internet (which seems like an option more befitting of a Radisson Inn). Video calls lagged and downloads were slow.
-The Nobu Sensei, while excellent, has a small menu. It's the only restaurant on the property, so the only other option is to go into town or the other Four Seasons. The overnight, in-room dining options are limited to four salads.

The reason is is that we stayed at the main resort and not this property, which I believe was still in the process of a soft opening.  BUT we did experience the restaurant and that is worth a comment or two.  If TripAdvisor opens a restaurant review section for this property then this should be transferred there but as my understanding is the Nobu at the Koele location is not open to the general public and is part of an all inclusive experience, it may not make sense to do that.  Since we were staying at the main resort the concierge who drove us in from the airport told us we could book dinner and I was assured it would be a great culinary experience.  

We were booked for a 630pm dinner and told to take the hotel shuttle up with a departure at 6pm, and that we should return back to the resort on the 830pm shuttle.  On arrival, we were met at the door and escorted straight away to the restaurant and when my wife noted she was a bit on the cold side, with resort wear that wasn't up to the task in the cooler location, a blanket was found for her.  Mahalo. The lobby is huge, gorgeous and had amazing fireplaces.  Really spectacular.  And it was totally empty which gave it a strange vibe - The Shining??  Nah, that would be too harsh.  Just felt a bit ... well, sterile and cold in a way.  It sure would have been nice if we could have sat in front of one of those fireplaces and had a drink before dinner.. I felt like they almost wanted to rush us out of the main space and get us started.  Were we an embarrassment as we were staying at the other property and didn't really belong there???  Perhaps they felt pressure to get us out for the assigned departure time???  The truly great dining experiences I have had the pleasure to enjoy around the world all shared a partnership between the staff, cooks and myself that is celebrating food and a shared experience.  Not stuffy, not aloof, but joyful and sometimes even a bit playful.  Perhaps that is not what the target clientele are looking for.

The dinner was five courses with three options for each course except dessert, which only had a single choice.  The wine selection was relatively small but we were able to find a satisfactory choice.  No sommelier which was a real negative yet perhaps in keeping with the health and wellness milieu?  At about $800 for the two of us, including limited alcohol and tips, this was not an inexpensive venue.  Yet, I didn't mind the cost as the food was exceptional.  

I guess for us the reason we wouldn't return is that the place was cold.  Not just in temperature but it lacked a certain warmth and joy that we found at the main resort restaurants.  It would have been a really nice touch had the chef come out and said hello, it was only us and one other table.  Or if we could have been seated outside near a fire feature instead of a vast space that probably would be ok for corporate retreats but at the time was just not all that hospitable.  And that's the thing too ... throughout our Four Seasons stay there were so many small details that were attended to, so much hospitality and warmth, such a great experience.  Yet this place didn't instill a sense for us plain folk that there was a genuine interest in us and our experience.  And again, not to be crass about this, but for a cost half of this we had as good a dinner experience below, with better wine pairings, outside, in a setting that felt warm and comfortable, which to me is what eating a wonderful dinner should be about.

One other thing ... please consider offering more than one dessert option.  Maybe just offer a fine old port with a chocolate on the side, or something equally simple, as an option.  The main entrees were fabulous though and again, I sure wish whoever had made this fabulous meal could have come and let us tell them so.  It would have meant a lot.","Date of stay: January 2020","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I booked the trip on a bit of a whim after feeling incredibly burnt out at work.  As you will see, the experience has a high price point, but I can absolutely tell you it was worth every penny.  After 8 days at the wellness retreat, I have felt the best that I have in 15 years and have taken a lot of “tools” back with me for everyday life.  I was at the resort when it was still in its soft opening phase, so not sure what it will be at scale, but below are the highlights:

Pros:
- Wellness programming was tailored to my individual goals and was scheduled accordingly
- I felt like the staff took a genuine interest in my goals.  These were true professionals that I felt were top notch in their individual specialties (shout out to Marcus, Nicco, JT,  Laurel and Anne to making it amazing)
- The mindfulness pieces of the programming were my favorite and really got me out of my normal analytical self
- The fitness, yoga and nutrition programming really helped point out deficiencies in my daily life and made the concept of “change” feel achievable
- I enjoyed two off property activities, which was a mountain ridge hike and a beach day, both of which showcased the island’s beauty
- The facilities were absolutely top notch (which is what you would expect after a major renovation).  My favorite part was the onsen garden, which were natural-looking hot tubs built up the hillside and made private with vegetation and water features.  The pool was lagoon-style and also amazing
- The grounds were expertly landscaped with a lush feel and varied feel everywhere you looked
- The spa facilities (and therapists) were unrivaled.  Individual buildings, with individual sauna, steam room, Japanese bathtubs and exterior hot tubs
- The restaurant is managed by Nobu and is focused on healthy, nutritious meals, but it was such a treat to do a 5 course Nobu meal each night 
- Transportation to and from the island was seamless as well

Cons:
- While the rooms were beautiful and well-laid out, they are of much better sound proofing.  I am not sure whether that was a function of having a door for adjoining rooms, but I could hear full conversations, music and the morning phone alarm of my neighbors.

It’s something of a cross between a luxury resort, a wellness retreat, and a culinary destination. Once you book, everything is taken care of from your internal flights, to your meals, to your daily activities. Your Sensei Guide will reach out to you before arrival and help you schedule your ideal stay while there to do as much or as little as you’d like. They offer things like personal training, yoga, meditation, mountain biking, massages, hiking, and much more (too much stuff to list here). If you want to go to the beach (we did one day), they’ll take you to the other Four Seasons beach and set you up with chairs, umbrellas, etc. We also did an awesome sunset sail one evening.

As far as the hotel goes, the grounds are absolutely stunning. Most of the facilities surround the on-property lake which itself is surrounded by an amazing garden, along with some decks for yoga and just relaxing. The artwork surrounding the lake and throughout the property is also amazing (they really should offer a pre-dinner art walk of sorts to talk about the various pieces….hint..hint..). The pool is very big and welcoming. Lush foliage and waterfalls surround the pool as well as 3 big jacuzzi spas. Speaking of spas, they have an awesome Onsen Garden with lots of private hot tubs among the plants and waterfalls. Great way to relax and get a soak in between the day’s activities.

Probably my favorite facility here was the Hale’s. It’s basically your own private spa. They have around 10 of these, and they are like your own little house you go to for spa treatments. You literally have your own ofuru tub, steam shower, sauna, and two private outdoor onsens (one cold, one warm). It’s an incredible place to spend time in before or after your treatment, and you have it all to yourself when there.

And the food, well it’s absolutely superb. The Nobu restaurant there has an amazing menu for breakfast and lunch and every night you are served a multi course dinner where your biggest decision is choosing between things like A5 Wagyu or Lobster. Seriously, the food is delicious. One thing I especially liked was that even though it’s a very wellness focused resort, you can still get drinks in the restaurant and the lobby. It’s not like you’re encouraged to drink water and juice all night…haha

I booked the trip on a bit of a whim after feeling incredibly burnt out at work.  As you will see, the experience has a high price point, but I can absolutely tell you it was worth every penny.  After 8 days at the wellness retreat, I have felt the best that I have in 15 years and have taken a lot of “tools” back with me for everyday life.  I was at the resort when it was still in its soft opening phase, so not sure what it will be at scale, but below are the highlights:

Pros:
- Wellness programming was tailored to my individual goals and was scheduled accordingly
- I felt like the staff took a genuine interest in my goals.  These were true professionals that I felt were top notch in their individual specialties (shout out to Marcus, Nicco, JT,  Laurel and Anne to making it amazing)
- The mindfulness pieces of the programming were my favorite and really got me out of my normal analytical self
- The fitness, yoga and nutrition programming really helped point out deficiencies in my daily life and made the concept of “change” feel achievable
- I enjoyed two off property activities, which was a mountain ridge hike and a beach day, both of which showcased the island’s beauty
- The facilities were absolutely top notch (which is what you would expect after a major renovation).  My favorite part was the onsen garden, which were natural-looking hot tubs built up the hillside and made private with vegetation and water features.  The pool was lagoon-style and also amazing
- The grounds were expertly landscaped with a lush feel and varied feel everywhere you looked
- The spa facilities (and therapists) were unrivaled.  Individual buildings, with individual sauna, steam room, Japanese bathtubs and exterior hot tubs
- The restaurant is managed by Nobu and is focused on healthy, nutritious meals, but it was such a treat to do a 5 course Nobu meal each night 
- Transportation to and from the island was seamless as well

Cons:
- While the rooms were beautiful and well-laid out, they are of much better sound proofing.  I am not sure whether that was a function of having a door for adjoining rooms, but I could hear full conversations, music and the morning phone alarm of my neighbors.

I would absolutely come here again for a wellness tune up.","Date of stay: January 2020","Trip type: Traveled solo","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

It’s something of a cross between a luxury resort, a wellness retreat, and a culinary destination. Once you book, everything is taken care of from your internal flights, to your meals, to your daily activities. Your Sensei Guide will reach out to you before arrival and help you schedule your ideal stay while there to do as much or as little as you’d like. They offer things like personal training, yoga, meditation, mountain biking, massages, hiking, and much more (too much stuff to list here). If you want to go to the beach (we did one day), they’ll take you to the other Four Seasons beach and set you up with chairs, umbrellas, etc. We also did an awesome sunset sail one evening.

As far as the hotel goes, the grounds are absolutely stunning. Most of the facilities surround the on-property lake which itself is surrounded by an amazing garden, along with some decks for yoga and just relaxing. The artwork surrounding the lake and throughout the property is also amazing (they really should offer a pre-dinner art walk of sorts to talk about the various pieces….hint..hint..). The pool is very big and welcoming. Lush foliage and waterfalls surround the pool as well as 3 big jacuzzi spas. Speaking of spas, they have an awesome Onsen Garden with lots of private hot tubs among the plants and waterfalls. Great way to relax and get a soak in between the day’s activities.

Probably my favorite facility here was the Hale’s. It’s basically your own private spa. They have around 10 of these, and they are like your own little house you go to for spa treatments. You literally have your own ofuru tub, steam shower, sauna, and two private outdoor onsens (one cold, one warm). It’s an incredible place to spend time in before or after your treatment, and you have it all to yourself when there.

And the food, well it’s absolutely superb. The Nobu restaurant there has an amazing menu for breakfast and lunch and every night you are served a multi course dinner where your biggest decision is choosing between things like A5 Wagyu or Lobster. Seriously, the food is delicious. One thing I especially liked was that even though it’s a very wellness focused resort, you can still get drinks in the restaurant and the lobby. It’s not like you’re encouraged to drink water and juice all night…haha

I hope the above gives you an idea of what this place is about. I’m really looking forward to returning very soon and would recommend this place to anyone looking for a holiday!","Date of stay: December 2019","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The 3 BR accommodation is off the charts.  It is beyond beautiful and we love having a full kitchen but still having daily housekeeping.  The staff at Timbers makes you feel taken care of and any request is met with ease.  They were even able to return our Hertz rental for us.  We loved the farm tour and Farmer Cody!

Basically, if you have the money, you can stay in 3-4 bedroom units and townhomes that cost anywhere from $4 million on up to $8 million. 

The property is set on a point that overlooks the ocean so if you're looking to be able to walk out of your room and onto a beach, this is not the place.  But if you appreciate views, excellent service/food and yes, golfing, then there is no better place than Timbers on Kauai.  The golf course is considered one of the best in the islands with 4 holes along the ocean.

Though the nightly rates are very high, you also have to take into consideration that parking is free, and things like beach chairs, bikes and kayaks are free to use at Timbers too.  You don't even need to sign up.  Just grab and go.  The staff at Timbers really wants you to feel as if it's a home away from home.

Finally, I like that Timbers is centrally located on Kauai so that it's easy to go north up the east coast of the island towards Princeville, Hanalei or west towards Poipu and the west side of the island.  Though some complain about the planes arriving offshore at the airport (actually, the helicopters are worse), you are 5-minutes from the airport and Timbers can either pick you up or arrange for a rental car so that you don't have to wait in line.  Being that close to the airport also means you can be at the pool or on the 1st tee literally 20 minutes after stepping off your plane.  Try doing that anywhere else in Hawaii!","Date of stay: July 2022","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

When we approached the reception to check in to the Timbers Residence, I was immediately bombarded with a stack of paperwork to sign and accompanied by a verbal litany of the property’s rules, policies, and restrictions. The documents presented for my signature included agreeing to a $25/day “resort fee” and a $200 a day , (total of $1,000) “damage deposit” hold. 

What was even more irritating was being informed when checking out that  it would be four to five days before my $1,000 security  deposit would be  refunded. When I protested the clerk assured me that this was “standard.”  Based on my considerable years of travel experience, I beg to differ with his assertion. Damage deposits are typically refunded by hotels within 24 hour  

 Why wasn’t this additional paperwork emailed to me in advance, instead of accosting me with the last minute flurry of bureaucracy? In addition, why the extra resort fee? It certainly seems like a cash grab, that I was not advised of ahead of time. I naively expected that given the exorbitant daily fee we paid to rent the condominium, the resort fee would be included.

Check out time was 10:00 am. which is way too early for such a high end property. Even Motel 6 has a more liberal check-out policy.

While I was dealing with one receptionist, my husband was engaged in a frustrating exchange with another employee as far as their  incomprehensible policy for parking our vehicle after checking in. We were not allowed to park it ourselves. The staff had to park the vehicle (so we were not sure where it was parked) and we were required to go directly to our suite. 

2.	 FACILITY

It is located in a gorgeous spot, right on the ocean  However, the assertion that it is situated on 470 acres is misleading;  most of the property is dedicated to golfers. The most beautiful parts are part of the golf course and non-golfers are not allowed on those paths. The paths where you are allowed to walk most border either main roads or the airport fence. We actually found the best walks  after leaving the property and heading towards the Marriott Royal Sonesta complex. 

3.	 RESIDENCE

Our specific condominium was   beautiful and pretty well appointed. The lighting system was very complicated and difficult to maneuver. Some sort of instructions would have been appreciated. 

In addition, a property of this level should definitely have a Nespresso-type coffee instead of the old-fashioned Mr. Coffee/carafe type.","Date of stay: April 2022","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_10"

The units are stunning, with designer touches everywhere as well as every other feature one could imagine. Perched above the ocean alongside a stunning golf course, the property is a perfect setting to adventure around the Island, or just stay by one of the two pools. 

The staff is kind, professional and caring. Rhonda the manger is amazing, as are the concierge staff we working with Ashley, Sabrina and Erica. We are not easy and they were great. A special thanks to the bar staff, Mike and Brandon, who helped us ride out some bad xmas weather with great drinks.

 Close to Lihue airport has some advantages ,you can get by for a few days without a rental car as they will pick you up and drop you off there as well.

We had an amazing stay at Timbers Kauai.  It started with checking into their gorgeous open air lobby & receiving leis, they were beautiful.  Then, once we entered our room, it was so open, bright & all the furnishings and appliances were fresh & modern.  The kitchen was extremely well stocked and to our surprise, so was the refrigerator!  We had everything we could possibly need for breakfast including oatmeal, yogurt, bagels, cereal, milk, orange juice and other juices.  It was so nice to feel ""settled"" the moment we walked in.
The beds were super comfortable, the sitting area was cozy and the outdoor porches were perfect with large lounging chairs and incredible views.  The bathrooms were also immaculate with deep tubs, option of a rain shower or regular head, two sinks and a toilet tucked away in a 'closet"".  And I can't remember the name of the product they supplied in the shower (shampoo/conditioner/bath gel) but it was an amazing high end brand from London, and all full sizes so you didn't have to deal with those tiny hotel containers you sometimes get.
The washer/dryer were full size which was great since we were washing clothes/doing towels almost every day.
And I'm not even sure where to start on the property.  The views were amazing anywhere you looked.  We used two of the pools and loved them both.  We actually had the pool/hot tub closest to our room/spa, all to ourselves.  It felt a little like pirates of the Caribbean with the lights, over water bridges and palm trees everywhere.  They even provided a large container of suntan lotion you could use if you forgot your own.
They had a garage full of toys, boogie boards, SUPs, paddle boards, bikes, all to be checked out on the honor system and use when needed.  We took 3 boogie boards one day on our way to the beach, just tossed them into the Jeep and off we went.
The spa massage was honestly, the best I'd ever had  I'm kicking myself for not remembering my masseurs' name, but she did a deep tissue massage that honestly worked out all my kinks  Only only get maybe 2 a year, but this was the best one I've ever had (including Bali, China and Europe).  To top it off, they were switching facial products (due to Covid no facials were being conducted, or I would have had one) so they let us chose a product of our choice to take with us, free of charge- nice little bonus.

We know the hotel rules and respect them entirely and for your staff to accuse us of noise pollution was uncalled for. During that same time another group of locals stayed there and they were the fault in this. They were putting us in hot water, causing us to receive warnings. But to be accused of it and to say that room 2204 was the cause of night time pool privileges was not cool! We paid a lot of money to stay and enjoy your facilities. It is this time of hardship that you should be thankful we are supporting you. Please do your research first before you start pointing fingers. To be exact, it was ""The Aguinaldos"" that was causing all of the ruckus. I also had to cancel my upcoming stay in November because I was given false information that you were NOT going to be a Bubble Resort. I was looking forward to Kaiholo 4 Bedroom but after being lied to, I don't need to be associated with dishonest people. So I canceled my stay and look forward to Koloa Landing's 4 Bedroom Penthouse.

We stayed in an ocean front room overlooking the pool.  Our condo was very clean and we had more than everything we needed.  Kitchen was well equipped and enjoyed the washer/dryer.  Tianne (Concierge) went above and beyond for us and even helped us with our request to have a romantic couples massages on the Lani for our anniversary! She also helped us book all our activities which took some of the pressure off of our planning since we’re very busy at home and last minute travelers. We loved access to the toys for our day trips exploring: beach chairs, towels, boogie boards. We didn’t get around to using the bikes- we’ll just have to come back! Breakfast was delicious with plenty of options. Pool had plenty of towels,  sunscreen and we enjoyed whale watching from the pool.  What stood out the most was the service-  most everyone went out of their way to make sure we were enjoying our stay! Thanks Raphella, Shuttle Service, Bellman, Restaurant Service. 

The only negatives: 1. Close to the airport so it was a bit noisy. However, we were gone most days doing activities and exploring so it was a non-issue for us. 2.

We could look left from our lanai and see the sunrise each morning. Let's go through some of the issues that have been raised:
1) Room comfort -  wonderful. No complaints at all about the room. 
2) Breakfast - $14 for the hot side buffet; $20 for the cold side; $30 for everything. The items available are nothing special - pancakes, omelettes, cereal...nothing you can't easily fetch at Safeway...but the pricing is reasonable.
3) Dinner - might be available, might not....depends on whether or not the dining room is open on any given night. On one night recently the restaurant was closed due to catering to a group that was on site. We found this odd since it left everyone else staying at the resort to go off and fend for themselves.  
4) Noise - The hotel is right beside the approach end of runway 35. If the wind is such that aircraft are taking off and landing on 35, you hear very little. If, on the other hand, they're taking off on 17, you hear every takeoff, even though the planes turn out toward the ocean immediately after departure. More of an issue are the constant helicopter overflights. Helicopters take off from the airport and fly directly over the resort every few minutes throughout the day. If you're inside, you won't notice. If you're sitting outside, you can't help noticing. Some units also have exposure to a garage entrance where they hear trucks backing up at various times during the day. 
5) Staff - Wonderful, well trained, helpful...no complaints at all here.
6) Beach access - there are two beautiful little beaches between the resort and the nearby Ninini Point Lighthouse. Unfortunately, there's no real walkway to get to either one. Both required skidding our way down a steep rock-lined path after first walking along the side of the golf course.","Date of stay: November 2019","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

The second place did not compare to Timbers so we extended our stay for another couple of days and on very short notice we were placed into the most amazing villa to finish our 9 day vacation.

Excellent for families. 

We stayed in the 4 bedroom, 4.5 bath residence for five days and had an amazing time. The staff knew us all by the second day, catered to our needs, cooked us custom breakfasts, delivered us fresh fruit, helped us with rental cars (which can be picked up and returned to the resort garage, no airport trip needed), booked us dinner reservations, and helped us with all sorts of random queries and day trip suggestions. The staff took time everyday to welcome us and share their lives with us. The front desk staff, concierges, and restaurant staff were happy to chat with us, provide recommendations and, in some cases, even share their own life stories. I've never been to a resort where the staff care as deeply as they do here and it shows. The small size of the resort (47 residences) contributes to the warmth and family feel. We will certainly consider returning in the future. 

Main observations: 
The buffet breakfast is superb and worth every penny. Fresh fruit direct from the island. 
There is a lounge downstairs where you can spend time after you check out and before you fly out (presumably on a red-eye)
All bedrooms have en suite bathrooms. GREAT FOR PRIVACY. 
You can take bikes out anytime you wish to go for a bike ride (free). 
Airport shuttle service and pickup. Concierge staff take your flight information and make a sign for so you can't miss them when they come to pick you up.

We went with our daughter, our son in law and our 2 grandkids.  The place was immaculate, special, breathtaking and truly paradise.  Everything in the house was aesthetically decorated.  It was a real treat to be able to stay in such gorgeous surroundings.

One “issue” we had however was the level of service.  The staff here needs more training.  For instance there is one restaurant in the complex (food just ok, not befitting the surroundings), and as a guest I could never get the restaurant to answer the phone.  If I left a voicemail, there was no callback.  The recording said to call reception if I could not reach the restaurant.  I did so and no one in reception answered the phone either.  After many attempts, I finally decided to dial out from my residence and got a receptionist.  Ridiculous that they would answer incoming calls from strangers and NOT from guests!  Once I got a receptionist she said she would talk to the chef to see if they could accommodate our request for a 5:30 reservation (earliest they claimed to have was 8:15 which was not doable as our grandkids were still on San Francisco time). They took down my email address and cell phone number and said they would let me know.  No phone call or text or email was ever received by me.  In exasperation my husband decided to go down to the restaurant in person and they took the reservation without a problem.  Also, what was more infuriating too was that when we got to the restaurant at 5:30 there were numerous empty tables!  Many resorts save tables for their guests so that they can accommodate their guests - with this place I guess their guests are not a priority as they don’t seem to feel the need to accommodate their guests first nor for that matter even answer the phone!  Service definitely needs improvement as for a resort of this caliber their service is NOT commensurate.","Date of stay: July 2019","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

However their services need improvement. We tried to call their restaurant for a reservation for 5:30 pm in the morning. No one answer, so we call the front desk, left my cell phone number, my e-mail address and no response. Never got a response. I have to go to the restaurant to make a reservation after I was told that they were fully booked. From 5:50 to 6:30 the restaurant is emply. There is no room service, so you need to go the bar to get the food and bring it back to your suite. Ask to buy sampoo and conditoner, not deliver and ask again when I check out and they have to run to get it. Front desk and the people that run the golf carts do not provide the same answer. One said you can borrow it, another said only for golfer. It is the little stuffs that required more staff training.

Timbers Kauai has done a wonderful job capturing the beauty and essence of the island. Timbers Kauai makes you may feel you have this enchanting island almost entirely to yourself. This luxury resort is centrally located near Lihue and privacy, style and an almost zen-like calm are the order of the day. There is a lot to love about Timbers Kauai. The buildings, grounds and pools, including an amazing infinity pool overlooking the ocean, capture the essence of Hawaiian architecture and surrounding lush landscape.  The luxury rooms are well-appointed, extremely comfortable and beautifully decorated. The attentive staff ensures that your time at Timbers Kauai is as relaxing or active as you want, from paddle boarding to golfing to biking to other popular island activities. Throughout the day you have access to the world class restaurant that serves amazing cuisine using fruits and vegetables grown at the resort’s on-site farm.  Our family of five loved our stay at Timbers Kauai. We are extremely impressed with Timbers Resorts and the level of care and detail they put into their properties.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Timbers resort.  We had a beachfront 4 bedroom villa that overlooked the pool and ocean.  It was perfect for my husband and I and our four children (2 adults and two teenagers).  The villa was nicely appointed and the staff were super friendly, helpful and accommodating.  They had great suggestions for places to have dinner or sights not to miss.  The resort is conveniently located close to the airport, a 5 minute drive.  I was a little concerned about being so close but never minded seeing the planes land while lounging by the pool.  The central location is ideal to head out to sights on the south side of the island or the north.

We enjoyed a round of golf during our stay and the back nine has amazing ocean views on many holes.  The course is not overly long but an enjoyable resort course.  We also enjoyed several massages at the spa which is small but very nice.

The villa itself had amazing views and was well laid out so that each bedroom was very private, each with its own private bath.   We also grilled several dinners on the spacious lanai with built in grill.  We were in residence during the one year anniversary of the resort opening, which they celebrated with a fabulous dinner....each offering was more delicious than the next.  

Overall, I would highly recommend this resort and I look forward to staying here again when we next return to Kauai.","Date of stay: July 2019","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

From poolside, the noise from the planes landing are very, very minimal.  Actually, I enjoyed watching the planes land while lounging at the pool!

It is definitely a pleasant and peaceful experience while staying at the resort.  Breathe taking views of Ninini Point, Nawiliwili Bay, and the nearby Ha'upu Mountain Range.

They've been in operation for a year now and staff is still learning the quirks of operating this facility.  My only complaint was the fact that the jacuzzi setting was very hot (max).

The decor is pleasant, the staff is friendly and helpful. 

We stayed at a three-room unit with lovely views of the harbor. Unfortunately, our unit also faced the entrance into the underground garage and the daily noise from delivery trucks backing down the driveway (BEEP--BEEP-BEEP) or the truly mind-numbing noise of refrigerator trucks running their engines for extended periods of time was decidedly not conducive to enjoying your balcony. 

Adding to this avoidable noise pollution was the regular noise of helicopters who (sometimes in less than 5-minute intervals) would fly directly overhead. 

The resort is located very close to Lihue airport--planes land and depart with high frequency during the day, and the noise is especially acute at the lovely pools facing the ocean.

Mercifully, if you keep your balcony doors or windows closed, you will not hear these noises. But if you are looking for a tranquil resort experience using the outdoor spaces, at the very least ask for a unit far away from the delivery truck route.","Date of stay: May 2019","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

The property is lovely, but your Timbers staff is a big reason why.  From all the front desk staff, both day and night, to Brian, Cliff, Chad in the gym, Mica in the restaurant and pool, RJ making omelets, and of course, farmer Cody (and his co-worker Samuel who we met when we didn’t have enough lettuce for dinner one night) .  They are the secret sauce to making your place somewhere you want to come back to.

We rode bikes several times around the property, which was enjoyable after those big breakfasts.  But perhaps the most memorable part of our stay, including activities around the island, was the visit to the Timbers farm.  We ended up with an almost two hour tour (probably because we asked so many questions) that left us wowed and in awe of taking an abandoned golf course and turning it into an organic farm, where you can take the produce back to your residence and cook it up into an amazing dinner as we did several evenings.  

Farmer Cody was so enthusiastic about organic, self sustainable farming and the way he tries to grow and cultivate his crops on Kauai-he’s truly a gem!   The lettuce, radishes, carrots and assorted herbs tasted unlike any farmers market produce we have ever had.  We dined at the farm to table dinner afterward at the restaurant and we were so excited to see some of the produce we’d seen in the field a day earlier on the menu that night.

Thank you so much for a memorable stay!","Date of stay: February 2019","Trip type: Traveled with friends","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The island exceeded all expectations... the resort... Stunning in every respect.  Timbers spared no expense to bring this amazing location to life. And live it does!  from the moment you arrive, you know things are different here.  A casual elegance combined with stunning views and staff that will soon feel like an extension of your family.
  With a total of 2 adults and 4 adult children in our group, we were never cramped or crowded.  From of 3rd-floor villa, we have a wonderful view of the mountains and harbor as well as the crashing surf in the distance.  each morning starts with an inclusive breakfast that is both buffet style as well as cooked to order.  Never had rice for breakfast before??? Well after a week of eating the amazing breakfast rice at Timbers Kauai, I want it every day for the rest of my life!  Just eat some... you will understand.  There are lots of secrets here discover... but I will spoil a few... At least one morning... get up early and ride a really good quality resort bike out to the lighthouse to watch the sunrise... it takes about 15 easy minutes and it is fantastic.... there used to be 2 golf courses... but nature reclaimed one... the result is like nothing you have seen... miles of paved cart paths winding through a jungle bird sanctuary.  There is basically no evidence the course was ever there except for the cart paths.  and then the surprise... in the middle of the jungle paradise is Farmer Cody.  Cody has poured his soul into reclaiming a few acres from the jungle and developed the most amazing organic farm you could imagine.  We were encouraged to harvest what we wanted for snacks and meals in our new home...  If Timbers Kauai has a single most valuable asset it might just be farmer Cody.... kick off your shoes and feel the earth... in a few moments, it becomes ""your"" garden... It is good to know Cody will tend the field until our next return.

Heading back to the resort from the jungle garden you no longer feel like a guest... you have become family and you are headed home.  The entire staff makes the extra effort to lightly check in ... make sure you have everything you need and want.

Housekeeping is outstanding in every respect.  Never an item out of place Never once felt invasive, perfect.

While the resort is not Beachfront it is Oceanfront.  the views and nonstop amazing!  Actual Beach Access is delivered a short stroll away or take a bike or catch a ride from the guest services crew out front.  Once at the beach check in with Beach boys... surfboard?  yep  SUP? here ya go.. plus chairs instructions and more... Somehow Timbers has embedded their approach to hospitality into this beach crew... they don't know the word no... they just make it happen.  The local surfers are all very friendly .. no fighting over waves... plenty to go around... 

Regrets--- you bet--- I wish I had paid closer attention to the resort activity guide that is handed to you at check-in... it spells out something special to do every day... when we were  about to leave we met the activity director/leader / professional fun guy to hang out with... do yourself a favor... meet him early... he has the lowdown on the cool stuff...  We will be back... you should not miss it.","Date of stay: October 2018","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

This is a finely detailed resort. Each day I delighted in uncovering a new piece of art, admiring the orchids in the hallways or noticing the special amenities such as the complimentary sun screen dispenser. (love that sun screen btw) The atmosphere is very intimate and the staff will try to personalize your visit. They were always willing to chat and give information at the front desk. We stayed in a beautifully furnished 3 bedroom unit with a complete kitchen in the Maliula building. There are facilities to barbecue out back with an adjoining fire pit. Costco and Safeway are 10 minutes away if you want to stock up on groceries.  Don't miss the beach party each week for a chance to use the paddle and surf boards, beach chairs and be entertained by the staff.  I love this place and will definitely return.","Date of stay: October 2018","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

When we got there, we found out that they were only having a buffet that night at $75 per person, were not usually open for dinner on Sunday. The alternative was Bar food (pupus) which we chose, although they were out of 2 of them. They were average and the service was so-so but the restaurant has only been open for a month, there's promise. However, there is an absolutely fantastic view from the restaurant, that will make a visit worthwhile - we'll definitely try it again.","Date of stay: September 2018","Trip type: Traveled with friends","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

As is the case with all their other properties , all one can say is WOW

All residences are 5 star appointed and spectacular views of the Ocean, the golf course, and the mountain range are all competing for your attention

More importantly, the staff are what makes this place so special ..... from the folks who pick you up at the airport in their black suburbans  to the receptionists who have fresh cocktails for all arriving guests to even the housekeeping staff who attend to the most minute of details ( they even straightened out all of our shoes thrown about the unit into a neatly lined up row of shoes and had cleaned the sand off of them!!)

A special shout out to ZACH and GATHER in the activities/adventures dept who organize all kinds of cool things for the guests to do on and off the property.... Ask Gather about his guitar and ukulele skills

Breakfast is included with the room and the waited lunches and dinners on property are top notch and dining can occur either in or outdoors..... Large bar stays open until 10pm

Did I mention the two infinity pools overlooking the ocean??

I could go on and on..........

A beautiful visually place, the staff are friendly and accommodating.  Pools, restaurant, private excursions, spa, small gym, 2 pool areas.  The buffet breakfast needs to be improved but they did offer salmon, fruit, bagels, cheeses, eggs etc.
This is a place that is to totally relax and enjoy.  The island is also known for the Na Pali coast (a must do), Waimea Canyon, Hanalei Bay and the Waialua Falls,  beautiful beaches.  The island is unique as Lihue offers sunny, dry temperatures where in Princeville (appx 35 minutes’ drive) the vegetation is incredible – called the garden part of the island but at times its rainy.
Delta and American offer connections via LA or you can connect via Honolulu/Oahu as well, but you will need to change terminals.","Date of stay: August 2018","Trip type: Traveled with friends","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We stayed in a 3 bedroom villa overlooking the water and mountains, it was like living in a model home for 9 days. It's an ownership resort that also rents, so you feel like an owner, and it's just relaxing and so very nice. The homes are beautiful ... the biggest thing, the people and staff are so incredible ... the front desk - Brad and his team, Keila the concierge is so wonderful and helpful, the pool staff, the waiters, the bartenders, Chad the sales professional can show you units if you'd like to buy (and he's super nice and helpful and low key) .. all first class ... basically, they made us feel like family! I would say this might be the nicest place to stay in Kauai, all brand new ... all very nice. They are still building, but nothing gets in the way of a great stay.
