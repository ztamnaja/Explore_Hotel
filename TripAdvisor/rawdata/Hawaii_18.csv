864276304,50,Best Four Seasons / Hotel Stay,I could not say enough good things about my experience at Four Seasons Lanai. Everything was perfect from check in to check out. Service was the best I have ever received and amenities are amazing. Would highly recommend staying here. More of an adult resort but they did have a couple of kids around. This was the best honeymoon spot ever.,Oct 12,October 2022,,,"New York City, New York"
855567474,50,INCREDIBLE! FABULOUS! AND AMAZING!,"Those were the words our family ( including our children and grandchildren) used to describe our one week stay at the Four Seasons Lanai. There is a reason it was voted #1 Best Hotel in the USA by U.S. News & World Report.    The hotel has it all! Gorgeous accommodations, stunning lush landscaping, great service and delicious food. There are so many activities to enjoy including a beautiful beach, two lagoon swimming pools, horseback riding, hiking, biking, Catamaran snorkel trip, Spa, tennis, golf, adventure park and Observatory to see stars and planets. That does not include parrots and koi ponds.(there is a handler that lets you hold the parrots and they give you food to feed the fish).    When you land in Honolulu you are greeted and whisked away on Lanai Air charter for a short 20 minute ride to Lanai. This is included in the price of your accommodations. All the transport is so first class. You will feel like royalty!    Let me discuss what made it so special.    1. SERVICE- All the staff are so friendly and provide excellent service. They all have the best attitude with big smiles on their faces.    2. ACCOMODATIONS-. The spacious rooms and suites are furnished with stunning décor with the finest linens and bedding. My son said it was the most beautiful hotel room he has ever stayed in.(He has stayed in many 5 star hotels)    3. FOOD-. There are many choices to dine in at the hotel- Nobu, One Forty, The Break and Malibu Farms. My husband and I have been travelling all over the world for the last 40 years, staying in luxury hotels and I can say the food at the Four Seasons Lanai is the absolute best of any hotel we have stayed in.    4. ACTIVITIES - There are so many it would be hard to do all of them in just one week. There is an Adventure Planning team that will book all of them.    5. LANDSCAPING- It is so lush you will feel as you are in a tropical Paradise. It will take your breath away! There are 500 species of varieties of plants, trees and shrubs planted on 12 acres surrounding the hotel.    If you see my profile on Trip Advisor I have over 400 reviews of luxury hotels and restaurants and 220,000 readers. When I go on a trip I document all the people in a little notebook who made my stay so special. I am so grateful for their service to me.    On arriving at the Lanai airport we were greeted by the delightful Amanda in a luxurious van to take us to the hotel and also showed us to our room and explained everything to us.    Breakfast and Dinners at One Forty. This was our favorite restaurant with so many choices and the most magnificent view overlooking the resort and ocean. Thank you to the hostesses- Sharleen, Merrylou and Melody. To our fabulous servers, Juliet, Chaires, Christian, Alex, Norma, Ferlyn, Mairza, Anna Lou, Arnel, Vanessa and Helen. You were all so outstanding in providing us exceptional service for all our meals .To the Restaurant Manager- Chole and Natalie- Manager in Training thank you for running a wonderful restaurant. We were fortunate to have met Amir- the Executive Chef and the Sous Chef- Robin. They both came out to meet us and we were so appreciative of their creative food.    We also ate at Nobu where the food is also delicious with stunning views.    The food at Malibu Farms is wonderful for lunch. Thank you to Patrick and Nerissa for making the best pina coladas at the Bar there.    One night for dinner we went to the other Four Seasons on the island the Four Seasons Sensei and ate at their restaurant. The environment was a magical setting with great food. Thank you to Tibor for your service and Carlos the Assistant Manager. Be sure to go there for dinner one night.    To Sean Forte- Director of Food and Beverage who oversees all the food at the hotel. You are so kind, passionate and purely amazing to make sure the hotel that has the BEST food ever. Everything was so delicious and served so beautifully. We loved the macadamia nut pancakes! Thank you Sean for always checking on us to make sure everything was perfect. Our family is forever grateful to you! Four Seasons Lanai is so lucky to have you!    The Pool Manager Julia is so lovely in making sure everything runs smoothly including all the wonderful pool attendants.    We enjoyed going every day to the beach and ocean. Thank you to the Beach guys- Kanalu, Alex, Jay, Nick, Tuma, Steven and Trevain for providing great service including lounge chairs, umbrellas, cold water, towels and food.    At the front desk/reception you will be greeted by the kindest staff to check in, ask questions etc. Thank you to Jennie, Jessie, Britni, and Eddie. Our heartfelt appreciation goes to Mark Oriol the Resort Assistant Manager who has the biggest smile and was beyond amazing to our family. You are the best example of all the standards Four Seasons Hotels expect from their employees. If you were next to me now- I would give you a Big Hug!    At the Lanai Adventure desk- Linaka and Lilu’u were so delightful and patient in helping plan all our adventures. Do not miss the Snorkel trip on the gorgeous catamaran. That was a fabulous 3 hour excursion. All the shuttles to take you to any activity is complimentary.    The bell desk, including Randall, Dacyn, Tyana and Perry provided great service.    We had fabulous hot stone massages at the Spa. The best we ever had!. Thank you to Lindsey the Spa Manager and to our massage therapists - Tomomi and Susana. Book your treatments in advance of your stay as it is very busy and fills up fast.    It was also a pleasure to meet Avi the Resort Manager and Moshe- Director of Rooms.    I saved the best for last! A resort hotel that is so magnificent does not just happen. The person behind making Four Seasons Lanai such an amazing hotel is the General Manager- Alastair McAlpine. He is engaging, always present and has a good sense of humor. We loved talking to him! He is absolutely FANTASTIC! He is such a dedicated and passionate General Manager. You are the epitome of what a General Manger should be. Thank you Alastair for allowing our family to have the most amazing week at your hotel. We will have everlasting memories and we can’t wait to come back!    It just puts the biggest smile on my face thinking about our vacation at the Four Seasons Lanai.",Aug 2022,July 2022,,,United States
863206805,50,Simply fabulous,"We went as a family (adult kids) and had the most amazing time. Special shout outs to the staff who couldn't be nicer. It's just really special. Beautiful beach, water, amenities at the beach. The careful touches in the rooms also standout.",Oct 4,August 2022,,,
861216487,50,Once in a lifetime experience,"This was kind of a birthday treat for myself and it turned out just as nice as we had hoped.  To get to the resort you land in Honolulu and transfer to a six-seat airplane with Lana'i Air. We had never been on this small an aircraft, but the meeting with a representative at baggage claim, car to Lana'i air, flight to Lana'i was smooth and fun.  Shuttle to hotel waiting at terminal on Lana'i, quick ride to the hotel where we were greeted by Sarah, who brought us in, checked us in, gave us any needed information and then we were escorted to our room.  One note, the resort has no ADA suites, so we took a gamble on one of their oceanfront suites and made it work.  The bathroom was a bit small, and the toilet was in its own cubicle and there is no room to wheel into it. My wife could get from her chair to the toilet, but she has good upper body strength to be able to do it.  The service was exceptional, and every contact with staff was friendly and they were always willing to help or make things easier.  The grounds are gorgeous and reflect the work needed to keep them that way.  Food was excellent and we tried new and interesting dishes.  There are many activities to participate in, but these are very limited to access for anyone with mobility issues.  We did have a nice night out at Lana'i City Bar & Grill and explored downtown Lana'i City (two blocks around Dole Park).  Really nice fitness center open 24 hours a day.",Sep 2022,September 2022,,,"Genoa, Nevada"
861063494,50,A Visit to Paradise,"This was our 4th time visiting this resort and it remains our favorite go to place. The people are exceptional, the service is exceptional, the grounds are exceptional and the golf course is exceptional.",Sep 2022,August 2022,,,"New York City, New York"
856707365,50,Excellent for families or couples,"My wife and I just spent 3 nights here with our 2 boys, 5 & 8, and we couldn't have had a nicer time. The resort was so personal and accommodating, and kids are truly made to feel welcome. There were many other families with young children, as well as many couples, all existing happily together. There is a family pool and an adults only pool which really helps, but overall, the resort is small enough (in capacity) and large enough (in space) that each group can have plenty of room for themselves. We enjoyed the beach, the pool, the food, the views and the nature of the garden; the kids had a great time with the rescue birds, feeding the fish, interacting with Uncle Bruno, and catching lizards.    From the moment you get picked up at the busy hectic airport to be chauffered to the personalized care of Lanai Air, you will feel very special experiencing this place!",Aug 2022,August 2022,,,"Milford, Connecticut"
856230325,50,beyond expectations,"The pictures (and even the reviews) do not do justice to this amazing resort. The experience begins with the seamless transfer after landing at Honolulu airport. The Lanai air short flight to the island is both exclusive and professional. Relaxation commences as soon you step aboard this luxurious little plane.  The resort itself is breathtaking..and remains that way each moment of your stay. We spent 5 nights in a beautiful room (1112) with a wrap around lanai to sit on and take in the ever changing view of the coastline and ocean. The room itself is expansive and has a beautiful eye for detail. A huge amount of storage and great lighting adds to the appeal. The bathroom is huge and has arguably the best shower you will have encountered. But after a 10 hr flight from Sydney the best feature was 'that bed!'. Having stayed in numerous hotels around the world nothing...and we mean nothing, comes close to the sheer opulence and comfort of the bed. Words cannot do this justice. Words (and photos) also cant adequately describe how lush and brilliantly designed the gardens are. The walk from your room to the hotel facilities is to take a stroll through a lush and surprising forest. This all lends itself to creating the most relaxing environment you will ever experience at a Hotel. When it comes time to eat (if you can leave 'that bed') the breakfast is outstanding. Served outside and food of the highest order. No rush here, it goes until 11am. Then its a choice of either the pool or a short walk to the beach. The seating around the pool is perfectly designed to provide a sense of privacy and at the same time invites you to marvel again at the tropical flowers and trees that surround you. The beach is also the place to relax and gaze at the rolling surf in the distance. If you are anything like we were you will find yourself spending the whole day here. Then its on to dinner. The standout location is Nobu. Not only is it unique amongst Nobu's we have eaten at (most of it is outdoor seating) but the quality of the ingredients are next level. If you are fortunate you will meet Max at Nobu. He strikes the perfect balance between relaxed service and superb knowledge of food and wine. If in doubt, just trust in his advice and you wont go wrong. We dined 3 times at Nobu and every meal was different and equally enjoyable. Each night Max came up with a different wine to try based on our preferences and palate. He is an amazing asset to the Four Seasons and Nobu.  Pretty much the same can be said to everyone you encounter. Be aware, you wont interact with many staff as they go about their task of ensuring everything is done expertly and with discretion. The height of intuitive customer service. So, in summary..look at the pictures people post (and even the Four Seasons photos), read the glowing reviews, consider the awards and critical acclaim but at the end of the day just book a stay at this next level property and be prepared to have your expectations exceeded !",Aug 2022,August 2022,,all rooms are amazing. Ocean front are the best option.,"Las Vegas, Nevada"
856139461,20,Nice but needs work,"Overall, the staff, grounds, restaurants and physical plant are magnificent, but we had several problems with our room, including a shower stall that was almost impossible to use due to a rock pebble floor that was very difficult to stand on in bare feet; a bidet that was not fully functional, an inoperable coffee maker and seeing at least one large roach run under our bed.",Aug 2022,August 2022,Traveled on business,,USA
854687109,40,Family vacation,"Beautiful hotel  Just thought beach was disappointing as far away and not conducive to swimming (murky, rocky, jellyfish and undertow). Some is Mother Nature but not much to do outside beach. Pool area small for hotel. Felt crowded. Also staff sometimes pushy. Not genuine.",Aug 2022,August 2022,,,"Port Washington, New York"
854094337,50,Forever our new favorite,"We visited for 5 days in June and may be spoiled for all other hotel stays going forward! The grounds are tropical and lush, the views splendid, the rooms well appointed and so comfortable, the food out of this world, but perhaps the best thing of all was the exemplary service. Ditto manned our ocean facing chaise lounges overlooking the bluff daily. He was friendly and quick to serve. We loved hearing about his life on the island. Sampling the daily complimentary treats (frozen fruit, frozen mocha treats, frozen York Peppermint Patties was a lovely touch. Christian was our first server at 140 Steakhouse and he was one of the best servers we've had anywhere. Knowledgeable, Fun, not too serious, yet very professional. Don't sleep on the Grilled lobster tail. One of my favorite meals anywhere. Francis was a favorite at breakfast and always quick with a smile, always remembered our names and was a great start to our days. Kealii was our shuttle driver back and forth to the Sensei property and shared so much knowledge about the island. We would have enjoyed more time learning from him. Kara was our horse back riding guide and it was evident how much she loved the animals and was happy to share about moving to the island and what it's like having not grown up there, but assimilating well nevertheless. Cecelia was our waitstaff for the one night we ate on the Sensei property. She was fabulous and you could tell she had been there more than a decade. Four Seasons, you are doing everything right - don't change a thing!",Aug 2022,June 2022,,,"Cincinnati, Ohio"
852892337,50,Peace and Tranquility,"Atmosphere, views and service were second to none. Great for both couples and families the resort had everything you could want in a beach vacation.

849415814,50,A serene hotel and spa,"A beautiful and peaceful resort. Very Zen. Very luxurious. You fly by private Air Lanai. You get picked up by the resort car (a tesla), the grounds are incredible with the most beautiful sculptures ( they spent millions on the landscaping and art). Rooms are nice. You can sign up for a tour of the gardens and it is very interesting. The food is very Japanese inspired and super healthy and delicious. The spa is what sets this resort apart. For treatments you go to your private pavilion. The pavilions are super luxurious and spacious. Japanese inspired decor there as well. The most beautiful plunge pool and jacuzzi. Amazing treatments. The main pool is built to resemble a lagoon. You swim and admire the most beautiful garden. The only negative is that since the resort is a bit elevated in altitude, it is a bit windier and cooler than the Four Seasons on the coast. Also there is not much to do except to relax, meditate, spa etc…. This is what we were looking for and we loved it. For the second half of our stay we checked in to the Four Seasons on the beach and were disappointed with it.",Jul 2022,August 2021,Traveled as a couple,,"Burlingame, California"
847761037,50,Most magical hotel,"Well I hate to let people know how wonderful this resort is because I want to keep it a secret. I never leave reviews but this hotel deserves five stars. I have been to the Lanai five season four times and each visit gets better.I have stayed at the other Four Seasons in Hawaii and had my wedding at the Maui Four seasons but nothing compares. The rooms are spectacular. The service is stellar. From the moment you step off the plane you are pampered. You are made to feel so special. I had not seen Moshe, one of the hotel managers in 10 months . I was walking in the lobby and he greeted me by my name. If you want a heavenly experience treat yourself to this hotel!",Jul 2022,June 2022,,,
844691499,50,Ultimate luxury!!,"My review of this resort is a lengthy one - disclaimer: this place is hands down the best resort we have ever stayed at.    The overall resort and island:  We arrived through the Lanai Air private jet - this experience in itself was surreal, with the Lanai Tesla waiting outside the jet for us on arrival to take us to the resort. We were truly treated like royalty.    The resort is beautiful - it is a 'zen' place - perfect for couples or new families who just need a break from the outside world. Its great that the FS is the only hotel chain on the island (this and the Sensai hotel in central Lanai). The resort has an adult pool and a family pool, both with hot tubs of their own and a private beach. Generally, we found the entire resort to be relatively quiet when we went in May 2022 for our honeymoon. It was lovely and we really did get to relax. The hotel is surrounded by gardens and greenery and the theming of the hotel was beautiful.    Our room:  We had a beautiful ocean view room - the size was great, very spacious with a lovely balcony too. The bathrooms are also huge with a full bathtub as well as a shower. The automated toilets were a fun experience.    The food:  Breakfast was included for us in our booking as we booked through one of the FS travel agents. Breakfast is located in One Forty restaurant every morning - its a table service breakfast but with a very extensive menu. The staff are happy to make things which aren't on the menu for you - generally, if they have the ingredients, they are happy to make anything!    We dined at every restaurant in this hotel. One Forty, Nobu, Malibu Farm, The Views, and The Break. EVERY single restaurant was phenomenal - food was beyond incredible and the service everywhere was really at a high standard, just like you'd expect from the FS. In particular, we opted for the Nobu Omakese experience - I HIGHLY recommend this for families or couples who want a bespoke and special dining experience. Chef Hung Nguyen's food was mouth-watering - we really didn't want the meal to end.    The staff and the team:  This is really what made our experience so perfect, for a trip as special as our honeymoon. Kayla welcomed us when we arrived and gave us a tour of the resort - she was so helpful, we couldn't thank her enough for looking after us so well.    Larissa at Malibu Farm, Joy and Patrick at The Break were lovely and welcomed us on our first day at each restaurant. Joy was such a delightful waitress at The Break - she gave us honest opinions of each dish, which ones she would recommend and boy she was spot on!!!    Mayra and John - our masseuses were great, we had the most relaxing spa experience here with wonderful massages.    A special thanks to Sean (F&B Director), Avi (resort manager) and Richard (AD of rooms) who made our stay so memorable. they looked after us throughout our entire stay, checked up on us multiple times to make sure we were having a great time and they really went out of their way to do the small things which made the stay perfect.    To summarise, we have stayed at many Four Seasons and Ritz Carltons - this was hands down the best one... nothing even comes close. If you want true luxury, this is the place you are after and I can see why its rated as one of the best resorts in the world. We will never forget this experience.",Jun 2022,May 2022,,,
840474836,10,Bad restaurant experience,"I visited Maui to celebrate my birthday. This was my first time visiting Hawaii and I was very excited. A local friend of mine and I decided to visit Lanai for the day. Once we arrived we asked several people on the island where the best place was to have lunch and they recommended the Four Seasons.    When we arrived at the restaurant the woman near the sandwiches welcomed us and said we could take a seat anywhere we wanted. She didn't ask us if were guests of the hotel or if we were visiting for lunch.    We went ahead and took a seat and when our server arrived she asked us if we were staying there. We said ""no"" and that we were just here for lunch. She proceeded to leave and then the woman who greeted us approached us and let us know that we could not have lunch there. She let us know the restaurant was only for guests and we had to leave. She said that if wanted we could order some of the sandwiches that were displayed at the entrance.     The way she handled this was incredibly unprofessional and not what you would expect from a Four Seasons Hotel. I felt embraced by the way she treated us. I've worked in the hotel industry before and this is not how you treat anybody. This could have been handled way more considerately and professionally.    I also work in marketing in the yachting industry in the San Francisco Bay Area. The biggest form of marketing a business can have is word of mouth and creating an excellent experience for everyone - as you never know if they may be future guests. With the way this woman treated us, she lost 2 future patrons to the hotel. I will also not be recommending this hotel to any of my clients.      If you want to be treated with consideration, dignity, and respect go somewhere else.",May 2022,May 2022,,,"Sedona, Arizona"
839101107,30,Disappointing...,"Not sure if this is a post Covid symptom but what is clear about this Four Seasons is it has staffing issues, there just isn't enough trained staff. Some of the workers they do have are clearly not trained in customer service. Some are rude and abrupt and others just do not have the required skills to fulfil their role. For example, some bar staff or pool attendants do not know how to make cocktails properly and for the price you expect more than just crushed ice in a plastic glass. I witnessed one bar staff actually shouting at a guest because he wanted to order a drink after 10:30PM. On arrival after a lengthy journey we had to wait over 2hrs for the room, it wasn't avaialble at 3PM. I appreciate they were very busy but it didn't make for a good start. The room was very clean and well done but it was way too dark. These rooms need brighter lighting , it became very annoying trying to find items in your suitcase because of the poor lighting. The other thing that really annoyed me was the WIFI did not work in the room. I complained to the front reception multiple times to get this fixed but they were incapable of resolving. They use an external IT supplier and expected me to spend my time resolving the issue over the phone which was ridiculous. When I did eventually get through to the IT support I was put on hold and gave up. Having stayed at other Four Seasons I had expectations of decent restaurant food. The hotel has a Nobu and 2 other restaurants . We were unable to book into the One Forty restaurant as it was full during our stay but we did eat at the Nobu and Malibu Farm (Pool Side restaurant). The Nobu was such a let down, it was very busy and chaotic and the waiters were very stressed. The quality of the food was very average. A starter of sliced cucumber with a dash of vinegar $10 was a farce. A five year old could have created and presented a better dish. We had the lobster balls and Scallop which were ok but nothing special and for the price you expected far better dishes. On a different night we ate at the Malibu Farm which was used as an overspill for the Forty One. The atmosphere was dark and soulless and the food was a disaster. A bowl of black nachos and sauce were horrible and a steak with lots of tasteless vegetables and reheated rice. Couldn't eat any of it, such a waste of food and money. The two pools were busy and some beds were reserved the whole day without anyone using them. We ended up spending more time on the beach as it was busy and noisy. There is very little to do in Lanai and it was such a shame this hotel did not meet our expectations. The management need to sort it out.",May 2022,May 2022,,,"London, United Kingdom"
838893539,40,Place to get away,"Lanai is the hotel you think of when you just turn off your phone and relax. It started with what I'd call the ""covid special"". The rooms were cheapest ive ever seen and we would get roundtrip flight no lanai air. It all stated with a quick drive to lanai air on the other side of the airport in Honolulu. After arriving at lanai air we were quickly seated in a semi private waiting area for our flight. Only after 15min we were walking to the plane. There was assigned seating due to weight and balance but its only a 30min flight.    Once we get there the grounds are just breathtaking. The amount of species of plants would make every gardener lose their mind. We were escorted to our room (4-483) with our bags waiting on us. I picked a partial ocean view, with the location of the resort step back off the ocean and on a cliff it gave us beautiful views at a reasonable price. Only downside was at the time there was construction happening off the resort and you could sometimes hear he machinery. We had a 1st floor room with a beautiful lanai, we would sit there all night if we could. THe room itself is beautiful    beach:  unfortunately when we went he water was super rough so we didnt stay at the beach a lot. And I'd say the beach attendants were the really only low spot for me. Im not expecting them to wait on me hand and feet but every other FS resort ive been to has them walking around every couple minutes checking on guests. Anytime we needed something we would have to walk back to their shack. Also wasn't a huge fan of the fish tacos, super bland.    pools:the way the pools were designed with the landscape was just amazing. There was the regular pool and adult pool. We usually stuck with the adult pool for our visit.",May 2022,October 2021,,Pick partial ocean view. You are generally so far away from the ocean that the prime view wont...,"Houston, Texas"

834155732,50,Perfection!,"Paradise found. Our amazing stay last month began with a room upgrade to an oceanfront suite (we had booked an oceanfront room). The resort is just gorgeous - the grounds, the gardens, the lobby, rooms, etc. It is designed to blend into the surrounding area and it does just that. The vibe is relaxation and the staff certainly go out of their way to help you do so. Highly recommend John and Susanna for massages-they were superb! Who can complain about dining at Nobu multiple nights-they had so many small plate options to share and try that we never got bored. For comparison, we stayed at FS Lanai after FS at Ko Olina on Oahu. This property felt much more luxurious - on every level - and a lot more low key & ideal for couples.

833957418,50,Plush lush luxurious beachfront resort,"Four Seasons Resort Lanai    Plush, lush, luxury, perfection, unique    These are just some of the words I would use to describe the Four Seasons beachfront property. From the moment I was met at the baggage claim in Honolulu to the hangar for Lanai airways, everything was handled so smoothly that upon arrival to the resort it only gets better.    Front desk staff are extremely professional and personal. They walk you to your room and they hen the door opens to the beautiful accommodations you know you have arrived to the most comforting and peaceful room you have ever stayed in . I was fortunate to stay here about 5 years ago and at that time i experienced the same sort of love for this very special place. I recommend something with a view if you can afford it but the garden view rooms are likely just as nice. I had an Ohana suite overlooking the beach qnd I could see the sun rise from the double balcony I had. I think it’s room 6321. Which is building 6    The restaurants and food choices go beyond satisfactory. I tried to eat something different each day but one think i loved was the sliced papaya , and it was so yummy Two servers stand out in the 140 restaurant. Rowena and Vanessa so sweet qnd so enthusiastic. There are a million choices on the menu and you can’t go wrong with anything    At lunch I enjoyed my he Malibu Farm cuisine which was delivered to my pool lounge and the service at the pool as also excellent and very satisfying. I enjoyed eating the chopped vegan salad many days because it was so delicious and you can have tofu chicken or fish Yummy    Dinner I had NObu nightly and sat at the bar where the service was excellent each and every night /. I enjoyed many dishes but the mushroom salad on bed of butter lettuce really stood out to me the most and the Valrona chocolate cake who could resist? The nice thing as a solo traveler is the ease at meeting other guests who are very friendly and share life experiences right there at the bar at NObu.    The beachfront is beautiful and the beach staff is down there to help you sent up chair qnd umbrella and cold Water and anything else you might enjoy    Anyway. This wonderful property is so special and if you are even considering it just do it because it will supply you with a lifetime of memories    By the way. The General manager Mr Alastair McAlpine really is a wonderful person and goes out of his way to make sure the guests are taken care of and he manages his staff so well that everyone who works there makes everything seem easy .

The exotic plantings and water features along the open air corridors create an incredible sense of privacy. The ocean views are spectacular, made even more interesting during whale season.    The sports and recreational opportunities (for those who can tear themselves away from the pool loungers!) are abundant. Breathtaking hikes, visits to secluded beaches, snorkeling directly in front of the resort and boating adventures. Highly recommend hiring a car for a day to explore some of the hidden treasures of the island! And the golfers in our group resoundingly agreed that Manele Bay was the best course they had ever played. The views, the challenge!    Four Seasons service is always exceptional but there is something special here. Many of the staff are from the island and they are incredibly proud of their home. Some even took the opportunity to share island history. Despite the additional stress of following covid protocols, the staff never seemed inconvenienced or made us feel that any request was too much trouble. Staff smiles made us smile!    From the grab-and-go coffee off the lobby to the patio dining experiences, the food service was exceptional. Breakfast at ONE FORTY on the open air patio was the most delicious way to start the day. Don't miss lunch at Views, overlooking the golf course. Comfort foods with friendly service....and views. Our total spoil was our offsite visit for dinner at Sensei by Nobu. The dining room itself is breathtaking, the property thoughtfully curated with the most exquisite art collection indoors and throughout the gardens. The menu delivered the most unique dishes in a sophisticated yet comfortable style. Sharing of appetizers is highly recommended in order to sample the menu's extensive offerings.    Four Seasons Lana'i is a once in a lifetime experience. But we will return!",Mar 2022,March 2022,,,"Toronto, Canada"

My experience from reservations up to my check out has been top notch. As in other FS hotels, service is extremely professional and outstanding. The food at the various outlets of One Forty, Malibu Farms, and Nobu Lanai were excellent. I enjoyed hanging out at the beach and the adults only pool area.

And, amazingly, the Four Seasons Lanai exceeded those expectations. It's incredible on every level -- the property, the views, the water (the snorkeling!), the activities, the food, the service. Four Seasons service is great overall, but I'd say this property is even above that typical level.

829734812,50,Exotic Wonder,"We came to the FS Lanai on a trip organized by the company where I work. The company had rented out the resort so we were the exclusive guests. We arrived via Four Seasons' private plane from Honolulu and were taken via car service to FS Lanai.  For starters, the private hanger lounge offers  drinks and snacks and shows a preview of the  resort on a large screen TV. We were escorted  to our flight with no hassle whatsoever and  were in Lanai within 30 min.  The resort is truly breathtaking. The gardens  have gorgeous exotic flowers everywhere and  are perfectly landscaped. We spent most of  our time at the cove pools where the water was  warm and we could look out over the bluffs to  the ocean. The chairs and cabanas are nestled around the pools. There are also two extremely nice and well-stocked boutiques including fine ladies, men’s and children’s beach and resort attire, jewelry (including some fine jewelry) and other accessories.  The weather was perfect during our stay, which made for perfect views. We spent time in the chairs on the bluff overlooking the ocean and by the ocean. The service at the pools, bluff and beach was excellent - attentive, fast - and the food is top notch, as you’d expect from FS.  We don’t golf but for golfers there is a Nicklaus-signature golf course. There is also a spa though services were suspended at the time we visited.  Our room was huge with a large balcony and partial ocean view. The resort has three restaurants including a Nobu.  Lanai itself is unspoiled and exotic so there aren’t a lot of activities outside the resort, which suited us because we wanted to enjoy the resort everyday. We did do one sailing excursion and beware - the ocean can be extremely rough with huge swells. Those prone to seasickness should not partake.  We experienced a luau (complete with pig roast) and multiple hosted meals at the resort, all of which had great food and service.  The trip was a once in a lifetime journey given we live on the east coast U.S. so it was quite a long trip to get to Lanai but completely worth it - this resort is a gem!",Mar 2022,November 2021,Traveled as a couple,,"Baileys Crossroads, Virginia"

It started with the beautiful 45 minute ferry trip from Maui, where we were lucky enough to see whales. The hotel itself is stunning, the rooms are impeccably designed in a very zen style, with top notch amenities. Dinner at the hotel restaurants Nobu and One Forty were outstanding. There are hiking paths towards the beach and the golf course nearby with amazing views. The incredible, expansive beach is an attraction in and of itself, with beautiful snorkeling. Most importantly we received impeccable service from everyone we encountered. We rented a Jeep for the day to discover Shipwreck Beach. Another highlight was a beautiful snorkeling tour aboard the Lanai 2 catamaran arranged by hotel. There is a limited amount of passengers on the 65 sailing cat, which makes the experience even more luxurious. There is also zip lining with Lanai Adventure, which we will do next time. We can not wait to visit again, thank you Four Seasons for an amazing time!",Feb 2022,December 2021,,,

828465702,40,"If room is important, call resort first","When we landed in Lanai, we were picked up by a member of the Four Seasons staff and driven to the hotel. She was talking to us about the wonderful views and said certain rooms could see whales right from their balconies. We let her know we had booked a Prime Oceanfront Room and she said that we had the right one! We were very excited to get to our room.    As she was checking us in, she made a face as she saw our assigned room and said we'd walk to it together to take a look and let her know what we thought. When we arrived at our room it was certainly not the view that we were expecting. If you went on the balcony, you could see a lot of coastline and some ocean. Nothing prime or oceanfront about it. She sensed our disappointment and said she'd see if she could do anything.    I looked up the description or our room and it states ""stunning, south-facing views of the bright-blue sea"". Our room was facing West. I called to speak with her to make sure we were put in the correct room and she informed me that only 4 of the rooms in that category actually faced South and they were all booked. That was extremely disappointing and this is how we started our trip.    After a few hours, she was able to upgrade us ""for a small fee"" of $500 additional per night. We were stuck, since we booked this trip with the intention of lounging around our room and enjoying the views. It was extremely frustrating that they are not properly advertising their rooms and pretty much forced us into an upgrade. We certainly could have set our expectations differently.    The resort itself is lovely! We visited during a bit of a downtime for tourists so the pools were never crowded and it was always easy to get a spot at the pool or beach. You do need to reserve dinners and activities in advance, but they were able to get us in for the few times that we wanted to add dining or an activity as long as we were a bit flexible.    The communication at the resort is lacking a bit. We had to ask for a schedule of events on our second day once we realized that there were some activities happening around the resort. We also had to ask when our shuttle for the airport was leaving since they didn't include that on our itinerary. Most hotels of this caliber are better able to anticipate your needs and give you as much information about the resort as possible.    The food was outstanding at all of the restaurants! We ate at both Nobu and One Forty twice and greatly enjoyed each experience.    The snorkel tour was a fun experience. It's not the best snorkeling, but the boat captains, snacks, and trip out were fantastic. The sunset tour allowed us to see whales and dolphins and the food was also enough that we didn't need dinner. We enjoyed renting the jeep and touring alone around the island. Clay shooting was fun, but it's a bit rushed and I wouldn't suggest it for first timers who aren't comfortable with guns. Archery was fun, as was the ariel course. We skipped the zipline since it's only one and wasn't offered on the same day as the ropes course.    Overall, we had a very nice, relaxing trip on the island, but this Four Seasons doesn't quite live up to expectations. Some issues (full restaurants, activities) can likely be attributed to Covid, but other issues such as faulty room descriptions definitely need to be resolved.",Feb 2022,February 2022,,,"San Jose, California"

Probably best for those who may have already experienced other Hawaiian islands and had that experience. There's not much to do on Lanai - they promote remote beaches and attractions but honestly none are really worth it. Hopping from beach to beach is fabulous on Kauai. It's just not a thing here. Better to simply enjoy the resort and beach and head up to Sensei for the last 2 nights of your stay for a little change of pace and spa time.

826336347,40,Extra charges unbecoming of Four Seasons,"Four Seasons expense but with little to do. We booked for one night to play Menele Golf course. You can not get a tee time here unless staying at the Four Seasons, so we splurged for the golf experience. Without the golf, we would not recommend paying this high rate here. Overall the service was good, they discovered it was my birthday and delivered chocolate-covered strawberries to the room. One Forty for breakfast was very good. We did encounter less than friendly service in Break every time we ordered there. Our biggest complaint is that we felt we were being nickel and dimed unnecessarily. Coffee at breakfast was $7, but for $12 you could order French press. There is a fee to use the pool loungers and cabanas. On another note, the pools are very small and because of the vegetation setting if you want sun/shade you are going to have to more -- alot-- as the sun moves, and the loungers are placed very close together. Prices in the gift shop are outrageous -- men's grey tee shirt--$60. The frequent price for women's wear in the one boutique shop--$1,000. Rooms are beautiful. Wait till you see the automated toilet. On another subject -- the pebbled shower floor hurts your feet. Free shuttle service is offered to Lanai City. It is not worth the 20-minute trip.

825362657,50,5 Stars is not enough for 4S Lanai,"The issue with staying at the Four Seasons Lanai is that it spoils you for other resorts. The location is unique and gorgeous. We watched whales from recliners at the crescent area above the sea.  The resort itself is phenomenal. Our room (5-104) was described as partial ocean view but was spectacular- great view of the water and also private with lush foliage. The room is also a level step above most - smart controls for lighting, Toto in water closet, all redone beautifully.  The staff (and esp concierge) are wonderful and so responsive. We came in on Lana’i Air which was lovely and well coordinated with the hotel to make arrival easy.  We rented a jeep one day on site and that was a “must do” - went to cat sanctuary, Garden of the Gods, got all the way down to Polihua Beach, went to Shipwreck Beach, saw the petroglyphs, and went to Lanai City for a bit (lunch at gas station deli - everyone recommends).  We also did a snorkel trip on the Lanai II (arranged by hotel). A gorgeous 65’ sailing cat that limits to 20 passengers. Knowledgeable crew, great day on the water.  Dinners at One Forty and Nobu were excellent - especially love the smaller plates at Nobu to taste more.  Our ferry to Maui was cancelled (tsunami warnings following underwater volcano eruption in Tonga) and the concierge was very helpful to recommend Mokulele air as an alternative, which we were able to book so our departure (as sorry as we were to go) allowed us to keep our further plans.  I cannot wait to return to Lanai. An absolutely perfect stay. Mahalo, Four Seasons Lana’i! Highly recommend.",Jan 2022,January 2022,,,"Essex Fells, New Jersey"
824049913,30,Beautiful resort with terrible beach service,"We’ve been fortunate to stay at Four Seasons resorts all over the world. This is the third 4S we’ve stayed in Hawaii.  It is a gorgeous resort in a beautiful location on tranquil island away from the crowds.  However, it had the worst beach service of any 4S we have encountered.  Examples:  We were brusquely told to wait by the side because they were having a morning meeting one morning around 10 AM when we came down to get cots and begin our day.  On two different afternoons when we went to order drinks around 3 PM the attendant looked at his watch and basically implied that it was too late to get drinks. We ended up walking up to the main resort, which is a hall, to get our own drinks and did not return to the beach. Afternoon drinks by the ocean is one of our favorite experiences and it is apparently not doable at this resort.  The beach is very crowded and The attendants pack the cots in tight in a small area. We asked to be on the end of the beach seating as opposed to in the center of everything as it was very loud and impossible to nap. (Due to the time change we were consistently up at 4 AM on work calls and hoped to nap). The attendant literally threw the carts he was holding back in the pile in a huff and stomped off to the other side to get cots for us. It was embarrassing and uncomfortable. Not how you want to feel on vacation.  Additionally, there are no cold towels or refreshing treats served at the beach as is typical of all the other 4S beach resorts we have visited.  We are beach people and relish our time by the ocean. We will most likely not return to this resort as it left such a negative feeling of our time by the ocean.  For Hawaii we recommend the Four Seasons Big Island for a very Hawaiian experience with phenomenal service. Four seasons Maui has phenomenal food and service, but A bit more congested as the space is tighter….and if you don’t mind traveling a little further we highly recommend the Four Seasons Bora-Bora for exceptional service, food and stunning grounds and spa.  .",Jan 2022,December 2021,,,"Minneapolis, Minnesota"
823744306,10,Long Way to Travel for Horrible Service,"Let me preface this post with the fact that I lead a customer experience organization for a global brand. I recognize that it is only a matter of time until a mistake happens, but how brands recover from mistakes can build loyalty and trust with clients.    That said, the repeated communication and follow-up issues at this property were unacceptable and fall extremely short of the service bar that we’ve come to expect at Four Seasons properties worldwide.    Because there is nothing to do on Lana’i unless you plan activities through the hotel, having strong service, communication, and follow-up is especially important.    Some of our concerns were major, others minor. None were addressed for the duration of our stay despite daily promises that they were “working on getting the itinerary fixed and activities/meals scheduled.” See below in order of severity:    - We reached out to the concierge more than a month in advance of our stay with a list of activities and dinners we wanted to partake in.    - Concierge added them to our itinerary and never advised that they were not available. Had they not shown up, or had we been told they weren’t available, we would have modified our requests and set expectations differently with our children.    - Upon arriving we learned that most activities that we had been looking forward to were not scheduled by the concierge, and all possible alternatives were full and no longer available at reasonable times    - We received a lot of lip service the entire course of our trip indicating they were trying to get things coordinated. I specifically asked for clear direction so I could reset expectations with my already disappointed children, and was told to “let us keep trying”    - Up until the moment of our checkout they failed to come through with our requested activities, or even let us know that they failed, yet many still showed up on our itinerary.    - The few things that they managed to schedule ahead had times botched so badly that we were left waiting around for hours while we waited to go.    — The dinners that they eventually squeezed us into (again, despite having requested early dinner slots a month in advance), were so late that our children were sound asleep by the time they were to begin. In fact, we either needed to squeeze in at the bar for decent seating or order room service (the time change is difficult for younger children).    - Prior guests’ trash remained on our lanai for several days and was only removed after several reminders. Made me wonder what else was overlooked from a cleanliness perspective during COVID.    - We arrived at the property at 7:30 pm. Typically the FS Hawaii hotels greet you with a lei and welcome drink. Apparently 7:30pm was too late for their typical greeting, and we were asked to come down to request a welcome drink the next day.    - For what it’s worth, we weren’t looking for, or missing this welcome, but the fact that reception specifically told us they were not doing it for us, and then told us to seek it out as opposed to send something to the room made the greeting feel sub par.    - Hotel store was to deliver our purchases to our room. They never arrived. We went to go fetch them only to get back to the room to find some items missing. Needed to go back a second time to get the remaining items.    - Bell hop never arrived to pick up our suitcases for departure. We hauled them to the shuttle ourselves.    If your only goal on Lana’i is to go to the beach you may like this property - just don’t expect the little details like hand-written welcome notes, little special details for the kids, your name remembered, etc. Also, while it was clear they were concerned about all the missed balls (they paid for one of our dinners that we sat at the bar for), they weren’t concerned enough to get it right the next day, or the day after that, and that.    When a family travels halfway around the world with an expectation of an active, adventurous vacation, only to be able to stay at the beach you feel very disrespected.

822499653,50,Photos do not do justice to the resort's elegance and sophistication,"My husband and I stayed here for two nights in mid-December on our honeymoon before heading to Maui. To summarize our stay: I expected the Four Seasons Lanai to be very nice, but the rooms and grounds exceeded my expectations in every way.    LOGISTICS: The hotel easily picked us up and dropped us off at the ferry stop. On the island itself, the shuttle system is key and it is easy to secure your seats by letting the concierge/front desk staff know of when you want to travel. The shuttle ran roughly 10am to 9pm daily with departures from FS on the hour and departures from Sensei/Lanai City on the half hour. The shuttles were never full - at most 50% capacity. There is one guy who can be booked to take you between spots on the island - the front desk provided his name and we called him when we needed to get to Lanai City earlier in the day than 10am.    SERVICE: The hotel complimentary upgraded us from a garden view (booked on Chase points) to a partial ocean view room #1214. They send a pineapple delicacy to our room to celebrate our honeymoon. Their pre-arrival concierge was available for a number of calls ahead of our arrival and we booked our dinner reservations at Nobu and Sensei Nobu about two weeks in advance.    ROOMS: The rooms are stunning. The variety of light settings, Japanese toilet, shower, double vanity, comfortable mattress, and textiles combined to create a calm and sophisticated room. The closet had plenty of beautiful wood and silk hangers and the coffee bar was well designed. The materials are all high quality and everything worked properly, including the internet, iPad, and outlets. The lanai was big enough for us to comfortable sit outside to watch the sunsets. Frankly, it was the most beautiful hotel room in which I've ever stayed.    GROUNDS: Aside from the rooms, the grounds were the most elegant component of the stay. There are two guest room wings that flank the lobby - each wing has a different setup with a range of water features and plants. In the evening, the landscape lighting was spectacular. I was blown away by the grounds.    POOLS/GYM: My husband loved the Woodway treadmills. The two pools themselves felt a bit small, though the setting was scenic. The adult hot tub has a beautiful view of the beach. The family and adult pools were quiet during our stay, with the exception of one late afternoon when excited kids could be heard throughout the lounge area. We did not use any spa services and the steam room/sauna were closed due to the pandemic. There was plenty of available seating and lounge chairs.    BEACH: The beach was my favorite feature aside from the well-appointed rooms and landscaped grounds. The hotel loans out snorkel gear for snorkeling on the east side of the bay. The ocean water was a pleasant temperature in December and beach had minimal wind in midday. There were zero issues securing umbrellas and chairs.    RESTAURANTS: We loved eating outside at Nobu in the evening. Nobu was good - not our best Nobu meal - but certainly an epic setting. For our second evening, we elected to try Sensei Nobu rather than One Forty - we liked Sensei's dining room and loved seeing the art throughout the grounds (a Jeff Koons sculpture had been installed the week prior to our visit). Malibu Farms and the Break were nothing to write home about but filled the void in the daytime dining. Service was fairly fast at all restaurants, especially the Break and Sensei.    ISLAND ITSELF: The island has no more than 30 miles of paved roads and was a welcomed retreat from Maui. We took the shuttle to swim in the 25 m community lap pool in Lanai City (call ahead to civic phone line to secure lap lanes). We also used the shuttle to get to Sensei for dinner.    TIPS:  -Fisherman's Trail walk along the coastline - it involves some rock scrambling but is super scenic.  -Botanical tour with head botanist - complimentary tour of the species on the grounds  -If you are looking for a stay with warmer temperatures and a beach, I highly recommend the Four Seasons Lanai. We considered Sensei as well (largely due to the lower price point), but ultimately the FS's beach and rooms won out.  -I recommend staying between 2 and 4 nights.",Dec 2021,December 2021,,There seem to be roughly six buildings that house guest rooms/suites - three flanking each side...,"Paris, Ile-de-France, France"

820958367,10,They recently DOUBLED prices; it's a total rip-off,"Just came back from a long trip to multiple Hawaiian islands. This is a tough review to write, because there are some things about this resort that are nice-to-really-nice. The food is great for resort food. The sunset cruise was great -- the boat was one of the nicest boats I've ever been on -- but that's a separate company that the Four Seasons merely contracts out with. A pod of dolphins was playing in the bay every day. The beach service was very competent. All the staff were very friendly.    However, there were many problems.  • The resort was very clearly 20-30% understaffed. Lines tended to be long in the café; table service was sluggish; glasses and plateware were routinely left for hours in public seating areas; the restrooms in the pool area were only cleaned once/day so they became progressively more gross as they day went on.  • The entire pool area has fixed umbrellas so no matter where you sit you will be in direct sunlight/shade for hours at a time. Other resorts have all figured out solutions to this; the only solution at Four Seasons Manele Bay is to pay $800 for a cabana (reservations only). If you want to sit in shade all day, you either pay extra for the right to do so or you move constantly.  • Wi-Fi was poor and required you to constantly re-log-in.  • In-room entertainment was poor and allowed no streaming services even if you brought your own box to connect to the monitor.  • Gym policy was that you had to show your vaccination card and exchange your driver's license for a gym key every time you used the gym (even though you already presented both when you checked in). They said this was so you didn't lend your gym card to others (in a small resort on a largely unpopulated island??). But, even so, why not station an attendant outside the gym so guests don't have to walk all the way to the front desk and back in their gym clothes before and after every workout?    The answer to this last question, like so many others at this resort, is that they just don't seem to try very hard to be excellent. They're satisfied with ok-to-pretty-good. And that would absolutely warrant a 3-star review (maybe even 4 because of the food) except for one more thing: the price.    $2000-2500 per night before taxes & fees for a very ordinary room is extremely overpriced relative to better resorts on neighboring islands (some of which we also stayed at on this trip). Other resorts charge $1000-1350 per night for a better room and a better overall experience. We learned afterwards that Four Seasons had increased all room rates by over 100% as they re-opened after COVID. I guess they wanted to increase profit after the COVID downturn, and they think they can do this, at least in Lanai (I didn't check prices at other Four Seasons properties), because of the Four Seasons brand. Problem with that is: it's not the guests' job to increase Four Seasons' profit margin, the reduced staff has made the experience noticeably worse, and other resorts haven't all just summarily doubled their prices. In sum: run, don't walk, away from the Four Seasons Lanai until they fix these problems. Stay instead at any of Hawaii's many other incredible resorts that don't treat guests like cash cows to be used and abused.",Dec 2021,November 2021,,,

The gardens are really something that feels like they would be in a botanical garden. We had a partial ocean view and loved eating breakfast on our lanai.  --The staff. Everyone was so kind and welcoming to us. We were impressed by how many multi-generational families there were and how they kept coming back year after year. In general the staff was very attentive to all the details--which you expect for this price point.    My only caution to folks is that dining options are somewhat limited and given COVID restrictions in place when we were there, we advise guests to make a reservation ahead of time. But, as long as you know that you'll be fine.",Dec 2021,November 2021,,,"Brooklyn, New York"
820567972,40,Service not the same,"We have visited this resort several times but our latest trip in Oct/Nov 2021 was somewhat of a disappointment due to service issues, they did not meet in my opinion Four Seasons Standards.Some examples are:  1) We received an e-mail from Four Seasons to register online to save time, but when we arrived at the Resort we had to go through the normal registration process---no time savings.  2)During our check-in we were given a form to complete listing our time preferences for room cleaning and turn down service. After two days of no turn down service we called housekeeping to inquire why we had not received the service----we were told because we had not completed the necessary form at check-in.  3)Before departing for our trip we had requested the resort to make reservations for dinner at a restaurant in Lana'i City for Saturday night. Upon our arrival at the resort we were given a written itinerary which listed the requested reservation. When we arrived at the restaurant, we were told that we did not have a reservation and one was necessary due to Covid restrictions. The manager understood our problem and due to a cancelation we were seated.  4)Reservations were needed to take the Resort Shuttle to and from Lana'i City, and the Resort had reserved us seats to and from our ""dinner reservations'. Our return trip reservation had been made by the Resort for 9:30pm . We finished dinner at 8:15pm so my wife called the resort to request seats on the 8:30pm shuttle. The resort employee told her that it was impossible to make that change, and if we wanted to return to the Resort we should take a taxi. He made no effort to inquire if he could assist us in contacting a taxi company, or even giving us a phone number for us to call .We requested assistance from the restaurant in contacting a taxi and they gave us a phone number, but also told us that the taxi company does not normally answer the phone after 8pm---which turned out to be true. We ended up staying in the restaurant until 9pm, when they closed, but then were forced to sit on a bench in front of the restaurant until the 9:30pm shuttle picked us up.  Upon our return to the Resort we spoke with a man at the front desk and explained that we were upset of what had occurred that evening. He said that his records did not show our dinner reservation and that a taxi was the only option and that we should have asked the resort for assistance in contacting the taxi company.  5) I wanted to use the fitness center and was told I had to provide my Covid Vaccination Card and a photo ID to do so, which I did. The resort employee then told me that I had to leave my driver's license with her and she gave me a security card which would give me access to the fitness room. I went to the fitness room but the card did not work----I returned to the front desk. The employee said she would accompany me back to the fitness room with a new security card---she did and that card did not work. I stayed at the fitness room and she went to get a master card to open the fitness room door. When she returned the master card did open the door, but she said she could not leave the card with me---that was fine until after working out for awhile I needed to use a restroom. There was not a restroom in the fitness room so I had to go outside to find one, and you guessed it, now I could not get back into the fitness room without the master key. I just gave up, retrieved my driver's license and when back to my room frustrated.  There were several other issues that I will not list, and all the issues separately do not seem that big of a deal, but the total number of the issues certainly affected our wedding anniversary celebration trip.  And yes I did bring up these issues with the resort and was told twice tat I would be contacted by the Manager---never happened.  Upon our return we received a satisfaction survey concerning our visit to Four Seasons Lana'i, which I completed and stated that we had issues during our stay and were never contacted by a manager---as of today, we still have not been contacted  I would recommend visiting this resort because of its' beauty and that of the island of Lana'i and hope that the service issues have been addressed.",Nov 2021,November 2021,,,"Fernandina Beach, Florida"
820510749,10,"Terrible Experience — Horrible Staff, Horrible Policies, Dirty Beach","We had an absolutely appalling experience here. My family and I have stayed at numerous FS properties globally, as well as many other resorts of similar caliber, and we have decided to never patronize another FS property again. We are staying at the Montage Kapalua Bay in Maui (we almost stayed here instead based on a friend’s recommendation but chose not to due to the remoteness — we certainly made the right decision), and some other friends suggested that we ferry over to Lanai for the day, enjoy Hulopoe Beach, and have lunch at Malibu Farms at the Four Seasons. Mistake.    The beach was beautiful from afar, but the sand was littered with thorns. Forgivable, given that they drop from a native Hawaiian tree, but unfortunate and surprising that the FS didn’t mitigate the issue.    Regardless, we didn’t let this ruin our day. What did ruin our day, however, was the shocking treatment we received when attempting to go spend a few hundred bucks on lunch. We were immediately accosted. “Are you staying at the resort,” they demanded. We replied that we were not, but that we were heading to lunch at Malibu Farm. The next thing we knew, security swarmed, as if we were criminals, to kick us off the property. They curtly and unapologetically informed us that due to Maui County guidelines restricting restaurant capacity, the restaurants and property more broadly were closed to non-guests. That would be fine if true, but the Maui County capacity restrictions were recently lifted, and the property has seemingly decided to continue turning away potential patrons (as well as treat them like criminals, no less) for no apparent reason. I would also point out that this was not a capacity issue whatsoever. The property was practically empty (only 3 chairs were occupied in the entire pool area). As we were being kicked off the property, I looked at my stunned family, only to remember that we were totally screwed from a food perspective. The only real non-FS lunch options on the island necessitate a pre-arranged paid shuttle into town (can call to get picked up, but can take 20+ mins to get picked up). To top it off, all the lunch options in town close at 2pm, which was about the time we were turned away, so that was out of the question for us. We asked the Four Seasons employees what they expected us to do, and they just continued repeating that we would not be able to dine on property. Finally, one employee addressed the question and suggested we eat at the ferry dock, which sold horrendous pre-packaged sandwiches (we literally ended up having to eat them) that a newspaper stand in an airport wouldn’t even dare sell. That’s the Four Seasons lunch recommendation? Despite our appalling treatment, we swallowed our pride and (out of desperation due to lack of alternatives) asked if we could order food to go. Of course, the answer was, once again, a curt “no.”    Can’t convey how disappointed and disillusioned we are with this property and the Four Seasons in general. I don’t know what’s more appalling — the policy or the horrific staff we encountered. We will be sure to inform our friends that recommended we come here and to Lanai (and frankly, everyone we know) about our terrible experience here, and we won’t be booking any stays at FS properties for a very, very long time.    Strongly encourage anyone considering a stay at this property to reconsider. Super sad to see how they are mismanaging and squandering the natural beauty of Lanai with shocking policies and no regard for for visitors to the island.",Nov 2021,November 2021,Traveled with family,Avoid at all costs.,
815084629,50,Extraordinary.,"This is one of the most special resorts I've visited in my 60+ years. It starts with the people who work there, all of them thoughtful, kind, generous, and service-oriented. Then there is the low-rise buildings and the landscaping, like a tropical botanic garden with small waterways and koi ponds. The variety of plants, their heights, sizes, and colors, is amazing.    The sightlines from the rooms, public spaces, the pool area (two beautiful free-form pools also landscaped beautifully, are stunning. As you meander through the property, the mood is tranquil. Different birds, butterflies, lizards, and the chatty rescue parrots populate the resort. You must meet Bruno, who tends to these parrots and introduces them to you.. Spinner dolphins come into the bay, daily, to rest (and not to be bothered please).    The food ranges from good to amazing. Breakfast choices are plenty. Lunch by the pool, delicious. Dinner, especially at Nobu, wow! I did one spa treatment, a scrub/massage with Susana. I emerged serene, thanks to her talents.    We rented a jeep one day. There was only one error, and it was with the jeep. They had us down for the wrong day. It was great to explore Lanai City, Shipwreck Beach, and the Cat Sanctuary. There are no stoplights on Lanai, just stop signs. And 3,000 residents.    The hotel rooms are also blessedly functional and simple, while luxurious. This was one of the most blissful vacations of my life.

814195712,50,Amazing Babymoon!,"My husband and I have stayed at several Four Season's properties and I have to say that this one is the best!    We stayed here for 5 nights and were treated to exceptional service. The room was clean, spacious and modern with a very comfortable bed. Staff were attentive to our every need; when our in-room i-pad wasn't working someone was at our door within minutes to fix it,    The pools were clean, quiet and nearly empty. There is an adults only pool where we spent most of our time, however, the family friendly pool was still very quiet. The kids who were there were all very well-behaved.    The grounds of the resort were unlike anything I have seen. We loved looking at all of the different plants and greenery on our daily walks to and from the pool.    The spa was amazing; I enjoyed an amazing pre-natal massage.    The food was some of the best that we have had on vacation. We had amazing steak at 140, and loved the Shitake mushroom salad at Nobu. All of the restaurants were very accommodating with my pregnancy related diet (no raw meat, seafood, etc). I also enjoyed some excellent mock-tails :) If you go, I would highly recommend lunch at The View - which is the golf course restaurant and only a 5 minute shuttle ride away. We dinned at the Sensi resort one evening and did not find that the food compared to the Four Season's. While the Sensi resort was beautiful, I would not eat there again.    We went for a quiet holiday to relax and recharge and that is what we got. We enjoyed our time around the pool and on the beach. We rented a Jeep and drove to see Shipwreck beach. We also golfed at the Manele Golf Course - while the course was challenging at 7 months pregnant, it was absolutely beautiful with stunning ocean views. We spent a few hours in Lanai City, and found some cute shops there.    We met some amazing people at the resort who I can only hope become our life-long friends. This resort was anything but pretentious. We found the other guests to be friendly and pleasant to talk to.    My only regret is that we did not stay here longer.

814061771,20,Stay Away until they get Jeep Rentals fixed (and they stop lying about it),"You cannot fully explore the island without access to a vehicle, and despite them advertising it on their website, you wont get one, even if trying to reserve it months in advance. You'll see them parked in the lots not being used, but you wont get one. I don't know what the issue is. My suspicion is that the local community doesn't want hundreds of guests flooding the island in vehicles. Regardless, you're basically stuck at the resort without one. You can take a shuttle to Lanai City, but it's a very small town. Exploring the full island, you can forget about it. Staying at the resort, you could literally be at any beach resort, so not sure why you would otherwise go to the trouble coming all the way to Lanai. Of course, it's a four seasons, so everything is nice. But in my opinion, not worth it. I feel they oversold the 'adventures' on their website.",Oct 2021,October 2021,,,"Dallas, Texas"
813779594,50,Best Four Season's experience,"We recently stayed at the Four Seasons in Lana’I for our honeymoon and it was one of the best stays I have had in a long time. This was our first time at a Four Seasons property, after this experience I have to say we are huge fans of Four Seasons properties. We were looking for a quiet secluded getaway and Lana’I was a perfect for our purpose. We were really impressed with the way Four Seasons handled all of the travel logistics on our behalf, we only had to provide them with our arrival and departure details. And then from our arrival in Lanai to the time we departed Lanai and arrived at the main terminal in Honolulu airport, the Four Seasons staff handled it all for us without us worrying about any details or having to constantly carry our luggage.    I can’t say enough good things about the hotel, the rooms were clean and spacious, the beds are super comfortable and the food was excellent. The highlight of the trip was the staff and service we experienced throughout our stay. A special shoutout to Dennis for making our stay a memorable one. He surprised us with a very nice upgrade, which we can understand wasn’t easy given all of the ongoing covid restrictions. His passion for the island and the property was evident in every interaction we had with him. We would also recommend doing the Holoholo Island guided tour, our guide Paul was awesome and provided a wealth of information which made us more connected to the culture and the history of the Island.

812192400,50,Just what the doctor ordered!,"After cancelling several vacations over the last 2 years, we were looking for a place that would offer some long overdue R & R. We had travelled to Hawaii many times before, but never to Lanai. I was looking for unparalleled luxury, in a relaxing setting. Boy did I find it. In my search, I was trying to avoid hotels with screaming kids, lines for pool chairs and breakfast, and the typical hubbub of a large property. With just over 200 rooms, 2 pools, and stunning grounds, The Four Seasons Lanai was the perfect fit. The Staff is so very accommodating, without the typical snobbishness of a property of this type. We stayed 6 nights, and with the special they offered, that meant 1 free night, as well as complimentary private flights (to and from Honolulu) on Lanai Air, which in itself was a treat! We took advantage of both restaurants, which were exceptional (you definitely need reservations in advance), but Nobu won the 1st place prize! The rooms were spectacular, we chose an oceanfront...and it did not disappoint. If you're looking for a ""Maui type"" experience, this probably isn't the property for you. There is very little to do, which fit the bill perfectly for us. We had excellent massages, enjoyed the stunning beach front, and pretty much just relaxed by the pools.

Why is it PERFECT? The food, service, accommodations, staff and surroundings were all fabulous!    I have never seen landscaping and gardens so lush throughout the property. It is truly breathtaking! The gardens densely-planted feature more than 700 species of tree, shrub and plant species including palms, bamboos, ferns, orchids, ginger and bromeliads. There are 30 gardeners to maintain this tropical paradise featuring koi ponds and waterfalls.    FOOD: One Forty Restaurant has not only amazing food but a gorgeous view! Thank you to Loretta, the lovely Restaurant Manager who made us feel so special and knows how to run a great restaurant. I told her she will go far with Four Seasons Hotels. To our servers, Ferlyn, Charise , Chris, Sou, and Mariza thank you for your wonderful attentive service. Helen was our waitress every morning for breakfast who was fantastic ! Every meal including breakfast and dinner was of the highest quality and beautifully prepared. To the Hostesses- Analie and Merry Lou thank you for your service.

Sean Forte the Assistant F & B director was so kind to us and is responsible for all the great food and drinks.    Loved going to Nobu at the other Four Seasons Hotel -20 minutes away. The atmosphere at the restaurant there was beautiful and the food was delicious. Thank you to our server John. Be sure to go there one night.    Malibu Farm is lovely for a delicious outdoor lunch and we had great service by Medigale.    ACCOMODATIONS: The furnishings were stunning. Spa like bathroom featured a Toto toilet that heats up! Great views of the ocean from out balcony. How about the $400 Dyson hairdryer that dried my hair in 5 minutes.    Housekeeping was so attentive to all our requests. Our room was serviced 2x a day to PERFECTION!    THE BEACH: What a magnificent beach! Lounge chairs with umbrellas are provided for all guests. The service at the beach was beyond amazing providing fabulous service. Thank you to Jay, A.J. and Renzy. Their was an outdoor shower to rinse off and the attendants even wrapped a towel around me after using the shower. Food service is also provided at the beach.    POOLS: The pools were surrounded by lush landscaping and cascading flowers. Thank you to Julie and Kulya for your service at the pools. We would go to the beach first and end the day at the adult pool. There were plenty of pool chairs and even had complimentary cabanas facing the beach in the gardens.    BELLMEN: Thanks to Neal, Lester and Dean for your marvelous service. Lester drove us to Nobu at Four Seasons Sensei and gave us a great tour of the island along the way. Daniel picked us up at Lanai Airport to take us the hotel and had a great personality!    RECEPTION/AMBASSSADORS: Everyone there was so helpful and attentive including Evelina and Connie.

Be sure to book in advance as it fills up quickly.    We booked the group Catamaran excursion for snorkeling and It was a great trip. The hotel even prepared us a delicious salad. Thank you to the lovely Lydia for your assistance in booking at the excursion desk. By the way it was the most expensive catamaran every built- thanks to Larry Ellison!    Just to show you the kind of service the hotel provides. We were flying from New Orleans to Honolulu (11.5 hours with layovers). Our luggage never arrived in Honolulu. American located our luggage and put it on a later flight to Lanai. We took the Lanai Air – 20 minute flight get to the hotel that was a first class experience! As soon as we arrived at the Four Seasons Lanai and told them about our missing luggage ,one of the bellman drove to the Lanai Airport for our luggage to arrive instead of using the local airline delivery service.

The landscaping was a tropical forest of native plants and orchids along with koi ponds and waterfalls. Just going to and from our room was like walking through a lush botanical garden, filled with the fragrance of flowers.    Our beautiful room was filled with exotic wood flooring and furniture. Even the bathroom sinks and counters were fabricated from wood. While the materials evoked traditional Hawaii, there were modern conveniences like a Toto Neorest toilet.    The inclusion of the flights on Lanai Air to and from Honolulu, made it a seamless experience. Leaving from a private hangar without the headache of going through airport security was wonderful. Then traveling on the six seat airplane alone with two pilots completed this very exclusive experience.    The resort dining with Nobu and the other restaurants is as good as you will find anywhere. The service paralleled the best service we have experienced in Paris or Singapore, but with a lower key aloha spirit.    Despite being almost fully booked, the resort never felt crowded because it had a creative way of spreading out the lounge chairs and tucking them amongst the foliage so you would have a difficult time seeing other guests. At times, it seemed we were the only ones there. We often went to the adult pool in the late afternoon because we were able to have it all to ourselves.

The ferry ride was about 50 minutes and it was a great experience. Once we are arrived at the ferry, there was a shuttle to take us back to the hotel. The ride from the port to the hotel was about 5 minutes. My first thought of the lobby was WOW. I have to say the lobby was stunning and what a totally different feeling than Four Season in Maui. It was tranquil, less industrial big hotel feeling. Very quaint. The check in process was smooth and easy. The room was spectacular. The attention to details was something I never seen before. Bathroom had a TV screen on the mirror. Toilet was fully automated. The room was beautiful and the view was amazing. All of the restaurants were very good and we ended up eating at Nobu for dinner about 3 times. There are two pools, one main pool and a side pool. I played a couple round of golf and was picked up with a Tesla every morning. When you stayed at this hotel, they give a complimentary flight to Honolulu. They made us felt like VIP.

My only issue with this property is the front desk. When we arrived, we were told that every restaurant, every activity and spa service was booked for the week and that we should have made reservations 30 to 60 days before we arrived, if this was any other island we could have found other options but Lanai has very limited options. Our experience was not unique, and was not due to COVID restrictions. We meet several couples that had the same experience.    We spent the entire first day of our vacation bypassing the front desk and eventually we were able to get dinner and activity reservations but it was not easy and not what you would ever expect at a Four Seasons.

Giving us wrong times for things we signed up for, messing up our departure time, not telling us we had a gift credit from family on our anniversary dinner, being told there was no room at the pool when there was clearly room, having a beach that is not safe to swim at.

805857962,10,Not worth the cost,"First and foremost, Lanai is a beautiful island with incredible people. The staff at the hotel were exceptional, kind and welcoming. The property is immaculate and relaxing. The experiences, from the spa, adventure course and snorkeling, are well worth it. Nobu is delightful. Visit Lanai city, the shops and restaurants are well worth your time.    Our trip was booked as a multi-hotel stay at both Four Seasons on Lanai. Unfortunately, several issues arose during our stay that made our experience not at all worth the cost and effort. The room rate includes a flight to the island and transportation to the hotel. We arrived on time at the Lanai airport, but were left on the tarmac in the midday sun with no one to pick us up. Numerous calls to the hotel were met with skepticism and insistence that our driver was waiting for us in the terminal. There is no terminal. There was no driver waiting. Our very helpful pilots finally found a driver to take us to the hotel after some time.    Despite a great deal of time spent with the experience staff prearranging our trip, many of our reservations and requests were not actually booked, though they were in the itinerary provided by the hotel. Because everything on the island is run by the Four Seasons, you have no option but to book through the hotel. The process seems straightforward. It is not, and we were constantly working to ensure we would have dinner or our next excursion as expected, taking all the relaxation our of our trip. Sometimes they never call you back to tell you that an activity isn't available.    The golf course and restaurant were a bright spot as were the property botanical tour and visits with the bird keeper.    In all, the island is really cool and secluded.

We got a room upgrade to an ocean view room (such a wonderful surprise!) and the view did not disappoint. We could hear the waves every night while falling asleep. I appreciated the lanai off the room where I could relax and enjoy the ocean view. The beach is one of the best beaches we’ve been to. Soft sand, relatively calm waves (it’s a bay beach) and tide pools further down the beach. The tide pools were like a mini aquarium! It is a public beach (which I like) and hotel guests get lounge chairs, beach umbrella and water. Ordering lunch from the beach and eating at the beach was such a treat - truly felt like a vacation. The adults were happy to relax at the beach or pool. It never felt too crowded. Our kids also had a blast. One kid did horseback riding and the other did archery - both had so much fun. My younger kid loved the personal touch of her name spelled out with bath sponges in the bathroom and a mini robe and slippers for her (she also LOVED the parrot stuffy). The resort really makes kids feel welcome.  The two main restaurants are expensive (make sure you make reservations as they fill up quickly) but you can also dine at the more casual The Break. We enjoyed the food at One Forty more than Nobu (both are good though), which surprised me. The fish at One Forty was very good (both the ahi tuna and the catch of the day). The breakfast at One Forty is great. We had a shrimp coconut curry bowl and it was the best dish we had at the resort. I really appreciated that it never felt crowded anywhere. Everyone wore masks for the most part when indoors except at the gym. I spotted two men not wearing masks while working out so did not use the gym as much as I would have liked. Aside from that, I felt very safe at this resort.  We took advantage of the special they had where 5th night was free and flights on Lana’i Air were included. This was a great experience! It’s a small plane so there can be a lot of turbulence, so keep that in mind.  I hope to return one day as it truly was one of the best family vacations we have had.",Aug 2021,August 2021,Traveled with family,Weekends are crowded but Monday morning we had the beach all to ourselves,NY
802836813,50,Beautiful resort,"The Four Seasons Lana'i started off in luxury with the trip over on Lana'i Air. Their hangar lounge and small private planes (6 passenger maximum) were at a different level than we have previously experienced. We were definitely travelling in style.    The resort was lovely, and the food was very good. There is not a lot to do, but we were quite happy to spend our mornings hiking or working out at nice gym with fantastic views, afternoons at the beach and/or well landscaped adult pool, and evenings going to dinner.    One thing that was a bit disconcerting was that when we arrived on Monday, they suggested we get reservations for everything, but they had extremely limited availability. They were only able to book a diner reservation for us for 1 night of our 5 night stay. Eventually we were able to get a reservation booked for another night at the Nobu restaurant at the Sensei Resort (by Four Seasons.) Other than that, we ate twice at the Nobu bar, and once at the Break - which was a kinda weird combo of breakfast snack bar, turned overflow restaurant, that opened into the game room with pool tables. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't what I expected from a resort of that level. Also, they were unable to book us a couples massage. We got on the waiting list and checked in daily for cancellations. Eventually they called us and said someone had cancelled, so we had great massages in a lovely room.    I would recommend that people get spa reservations in advance. I would also suggest getting dinner reservations in advance - particularly at the Four Seasons. What we learned is that if you wait until you get there - it may be too late.",Aug 2021,July 2021,,,"Mooresville, North Carolina"
802316711,50,Only regret is not staying longer,"My husband and I came to this resort for 3 days on our honeymoon, before taking the Ferry over to Maui (super easy to do, btw). We wish we had planned for at least 5! We were fortunate to book in Aug 2020 before prices doubled. Everything about this resort was amazing. After four busy days in Oahu, we took the Lanai Air flight over to the island - so easy. Once we arrived, we were picked up and transported to the hotel in a very comfortable van with the nicest woman who gave us a great overview of the hotel and island. We were immediately hit with the 5-star service that comes with a stay at the Four Seasons. Gabby was our ambassador and she was able to upgrade us to an oceanfront room. She gave us a very thorough overview of the hotel and our reservation, including how our daily resort credit and included breakfast (huge thanks to Kristen Nix travel for helping us get this when booking!) would work. Gabby gave us a quick tour of the hotel and by 9am we were in our room. Luggage was brought for us, didn't have to lift a finger from the moment we got to Lanai Air. Gabby helped us arrange for a last-minute and much-needed massage.    Food - The previous reviewer is correct - you need reservations for dinner at One Forty or Nobu, and you should do this well in advance. We used the Four Seasons app ahead of time and the booking could be a bit frustrating, one time we were told One Forty had no other reservations but I was able to go on open table and secure one myself. You can also book spa services and activities on the app. The Break is first come, first serve and we had two enjoyable meals there. You can also get easy meals to go from there, and I loved their PB Acai Bowls. We enjoyed a breakfast at One Forty, but decided to do room service on the other mornings because we had such a lovely view. We used the app on our phone to order room service and it was very easy. The gluten-free pancakes with coconut syrup were amazing!!!    Beach/Pool - something we love about the Four Seasons but especially this resort is not having to wake up early and run down to the beach to get your chairs. You can show up when you're ready and chairs with umbrellas, towels and a lovely water cooler will be set up for you. The beach is public but very quiet and the chairs are in a hotel-only section. There is some fun snorkeling, and the waves are enjoyable but be careful with littles or elderly guests because we saw several people get wiped out. The adult pool and hot tub was a nice way to end your day, drink in hand. The pools, while lovely, are not the reason to pick this resort, you will find bigger ones in Wailea, but the kids seemed to have a blast. And there are still incredible views with the pool chairs facing the water.    Grounds - everything about this place was incredible. You felt like you were in a tropical rainforest. The sounds, the smells, the views. The rescue parrots were enjoyed by adults and kids alike. There are so many scattered hidden, private places to hide away and just enjoy your surroundings. There were two chairs near one of the big ponds with a waterfall, fish and frogs - on our last night we laid in the chairs, enjoying some gelato and the sounds. Everything feels so secluded and serene, I have never been so sad to leave a resort. We spent 4 very full days here and after crazy Oahu it was amazing but we wanted more time!    Activities - we did the 3-hour snorkel cruise. The crew was great, the spot was crystal clear, but the fish were comparable to the beach and not the best you can find in Hawaii. That said, the boat was huge, luxurious and with only 12 of us plus 3 crew, it felt like we chartered a private yacht for the day and this made it 100% worth it. In other words, go for the boat ride and some water fun, not for world-class snorkeling.    Sensei - the Sensei resort is considered very separate. While you can go to the other hotel for dinner, you cannot go just to explore the grounds. But honestly, we did not even want to leave the beach hotel for a second because it was so beautiful.    As a world traveler, my husband and I have both experienced a variety of hotels and resorts, in all types of settings, but we are partial to the beach, and before we even left the FS Lana'i, we were already planning our return. Thank you for an amazing honeymoon! Lana'i has landed in my top 2 favorite stays, right alongside the Fr Riviera",Aug 2021,July 2021,,"oceanfront was incredible, but garden views would be wonderful too, the grounds are beautiful",
801802904,30,Service needs a serious overhaul,"My caveat to anyone going in the future is that you MUST have all your dinner reservations (and in fact all activities) booked before arriving on property. It is literally impossible to play it by ear once you get there--all is full, and none of the staff seem inclined to be helpful. For dining, there are some nice alternatives in Lanai City as well, including Lanai Grill and Pele's Other Garden, but even booking those was a bit burdensome. The concierge set up there is confusing and inefficient--there are ""ambassadors"" that handle certain reservations and a separate ""cultural team"" that handles others, and there is no logic around who handles what.    Poolside and Malibu Farm service is solid, but other service...well, you could easily be waiting an hour for food, asking for things like salt and pepper and ketchup two and three times before it arrives...that part was quite astonishing. I want to give them all the Covid leeway in the world, but others who command premium prices as Lanai does (Amangiri, for example) have kept service standards high. I am not sure what the issue is here, as their entire labor base seems to come from the island of Lanai, so it is not like they have to go out and source a whole new workforce as others have had to.    That all said, based on what friends on other Hawaiian islands are saying, Lanai is still the most private, exclusive offering in Hawaii, but, once more options for travel open up, I don't think experienced travelers will opt for this kind of sub-par service at this price.",Aug 2021,July 2021,,,"Los Angeles, California"
801720609,50,Amazing Babymoon,"My husband and I spent our babymoon at the FS Lanai and it exceeded our expectations in every way. We had reached out to the resort prior to arrival to let them know if was our babymoon and I was having so much trouble sleeping if they could please put us in a quiet area and WOW the resort upgraded us to a beautiful room overlooking the small bay on the other side of the resort. This theme of personalized hospitality continued throughout the week. Every single staff member we came into contact with was A+. We ate at One Forty for breakfast 4 times and dinner 4 times and the service and the food were so good. The food served on the beach was amazing, my husband said the burger was one of the best he's had in his life. I had a prenatal massage and the therapist was so welcoming we chatted the whole time about the island it was amazing to learn about the local culture.    A couple of recommendations: if you don't have kids, avoid the luau. While the performance was amazing there were about 20 kids literally bumping into our table running around and their parents seemed completely oblivious to the fact they were bothering everyone. Second, the service at the Break is very slow. The first time we went the kitchen just forgot to make our order. The second time we had an hour before our transportation to the airport and they couldn't get us any food within that hour.

The restaurants were limited but excellent, the luau was super fun, and the breakfasts were amazing. Lanai felt much more exotic than our other Hawaii visits - that extra bit of hassle to get there was worth it by creating an air of escape. Not a huge amount of activity options (particularity given Covid and full booking), but a perfect place for relaxation and/or romance.

The resort is beautiful - everything from the rooms and pools to the restaurants (Nobu and One Forty) and the beach. Positives: the hotel arranged private transportation from Oahu to Lanai round trip and made travel seamless. The food and restaurants were amazing and lounging on the beach was incredible. Negatives: the price you pay doesn't match up to the service you get. We were told we couldn't go check out the gardens at the sister resort, Sensei, unless we had ""business"" there (i.e. unless you book a spa service), we couldn't get help booking a surf excursion or renting a Jeep on the island (we were told to ""google"" other options because their corporate partners were booked up) and although we made reservations weeks in advance, they didn't have a table for us at the luau and made us stand to the side while they sat everyone else, still then charging us $300 for the experience.

The beach is public but there are chairs set up for FS guests    We personally sat at the adults only pool for most of the trip which was gated off from the rest of the area and a huge bonus because not all the resorts in hawaii do have adults only and truthfully there are a lot of kids on the property. But it was very beautiful property with a lot of places to sit and enjoy the ocean views, it was incredibly calming and you could see whales!

But, big detractors included; 1. tiny adult pool w lounges close together facing into the pool. We felt like we were in a fishbowl. All conversations can be heard and everyone has nowhere for eyes to go but to the people in the pool. 2. Service was poor. Called the front desk multiple times and the phone rang thirty times w no pick up. We would have to call housekeeping to transfer us. 3. Pool staff talked to each other more than taking care of guests 4. Kids screamed all day w no one asking them to respectfully keep their voices down. 5. No way to eat at a restaurant. We were here six days and we got 2 reservations and couldn’t get into Nobu. 5. A person walks you up to your room but tells you nothing about the room features. Due to the tech there is alot to cover almost immediately after being left alone, we had lots of questions like about wireless access.    Alot of small things but they add up to create a certain cumulative disappointment.    For $1200 night I think it’s not worth it.

797757045,30,Poor service,"We stayed here in April 2021. The grounds and room were absolutely beautiful, but the service put a poor taste in my mouth. There were multiple issues with the servers at One Forty for both breakfast and dinner. For example, at dinner, the server didn't put down cutlery for one member of the party and then completely disappeared. She also didn't ask if we wanted dessert, just brought the check. At breakfast the next morning, the server handed us our check while we were still eating. Additionally, there was a gardener working on the plants right outside our room at 6am. If I had known that gardeners would be out there at that time of day, I would have drawn the shades the night before. I just feel that for a resort of such renown and of such a high price point, the employees should be better trained.    In June, we went to the Four Seasons Hualalai, and we much preferred Hualalai. While the rooms were not updated as recently as Lanai, the pools were fantastic, and the service was much better.

The resort is so beautiful that its beauty rejuvenates. I still daydream about the feel of the teak, the sound of the birds in the bamboo, and the flowers of every color.    The service is also absolutely world-class. Everyone here takes great pride in what they do and genuinely take joy in taking care of people. As a small example, when you order room service, the server takes the time to arrange every item such that they were perfectly spaced, aligned and aesthetically pleasing. It was like meal feng-shui. There were just so many ways the employees find quiet ways show their thoughtfulness and care. Kudos to GM Alistair McAlpine and the whole team.

797035556,50,Safe and relaxing stay,"Spent a week at this lovely location in April 2021 and had an amazing experience. Common grounds and rooms are immaculate. I was very impressed with the attention to Covid protocols from all members of the staff from start to finish. I was really pleased with the dining options on property, we enjoyed them so much, we hardly left! Not surprisingly, Nobu and One Forty were excellent but even the food served pool side and available through The Break and In Room Dining were exceptional. Service was strong, especially the poolside/beach crew that were working so hard to accommodate every guest. The staff running the fitness center was also impressive, they remembered my name and managed to balance capacity limits and cleanliness standards flawlessly. I highly recommend setting aside time to snorkel in the morning and venture up to Views to enjoy a meal at least once, it really is worth the time. One item to be aware of, the concierge/experience team are busy, like very busy. So service here was a little sloppy for a Four Seasons Property. I had to follow up on a few things myself and the ""Chat"" feature did go unanswered more than once both before and during our stay. But every time I did interact with them, they could not have been kinder, so it didn't bother me too much.

796153063,30,Disappointing for the price. Definitely not best for honeymoon.,"Beautiful property, beautiful beach, beautiful weather, beautiful room. But there were many small frustrations - too many for a 40K vacation. I would not go back, and I would definitely not recommend for a honeymoon - way too many kids.    We ate some terrific meals - but they needed to be booked well in advance, were not in the places that I might have chosen, were definitely not at the times I would have wanted, and there was no flexibility at all in moving those things.    We did some great activities, but they needed to be booked well in advance, were not necessarily the ones I would have chosen, were definitely not at the times that I would have wanted, and there was no flexibility at all in moving those things.    We had some lovely pool/beach chairs, but were not always where we wanted to be (pool was full, beach was out of chairs, needed to sit at the family pool..) - and I got to hear one lady talk about her strategy of coming down at 8AM with a bunch of books to reserve her family seating - sort of like what I remember experiencing 20 years ago on a cheap cruise.    We had some great spa treatments - but only once. The facility was totally booked for the rest of the trip.    Is any of this the end of the world? No, of course not. But I've stayed at many places where I didn't have this experience, and for this price, I will stay somewhere else next time. I'm definitely an ""a-type"" personality - so I love when I get to a resort and don't have to worry about anything. The ""scarcity"" here made it so I couldn't relax, because I was worried about being on time for our 5:30 dinner, making it to our 12:30 massage, and wondering if the activities I hoped to try out the next day were going to happen at all.    While the staff were extremely pleasant, and several went above and beyond, they were definitely not trained in a culture of ""yes"" - or at least ""that can't happen, but how about X instead...."" We more often got a ""no"" or ""check with X instead of me.""    Frustration started when I called to speak with the concierge weeks before my trip. She told me that we had better get started with dinner reservations, because the restaurants were almost fully booked already. That she would try to get us in, but we might have to eat on the early or on the late side. As there is literally no where else to eat on this island - this was frustrating. She managed to get us dinner reservations most nights (at 5:30 or 6 - not my preferred time) - but left at least two nights that she was going to get back to me about. Then didn't get back to me. Managed to work it out a day after we checked in - but left me worrying.    We wanted to book a jeep rental to see the island (common activity here). Was told they would need to get back to me. Then when I spoke with the concierge was told that the jeeps were sold out for the week. Bummer, but it happens. Then later, I saw a different desk, I asked ""are you the concierge?"" And was told ""no - the concierge is over there"". So I'm like ""what do you guys do?"" And was told that they were the activities desk, where we check in for activities. I made some small talk, complained that there were no jeep rentals, and they said ""how about instead you do a guided jeep tour? You get your own jeep, we send a guide with a walkie talkie in a second jeep in front of you, and he take you wherever you want?"" I'm like ""great! why wouldn't I do that instead of renting the jeep that I wanted?"" They said ""is similar, except you max out at 4.5 hours (fine for me), you get a guide (fine for me), you get lunch included (fine for me) and is $75 more (fine for me), but you don't need to fill the tank when you return the jeep (obviously, fine for me). Why didn't the original concierge suggest this (instead of just telling me they were out of jeeps)? No idea.    I asked the guy checking us in if he had a map of the property. He said ""sure - will drop it in the room later"". Map never came. I saw the guy the next day - laughed - ""hey, you owe me a map"" - he laughed at that, said he would get me one. Never did.    I won't go on more, but there were at least half a dozen times someone could have helped us with something, but instead said to go talk with someone else.    Snorkeling wasn't the best - beach is choppy, and the snorkel cruise was lovely, but takes you to one small location. So if snorkeling is a priority, this isn't the best location.    I would not come here for a honeymoon. This was the first week of July, so kids aren't in school. And maybe on a different time of the year it feels more like an adult resort. The kids were mostly pleasant and well supervised. But the ""adults"" pool is small, and we usually weren't able to get seats at it (see my point about scarcity above..). And we didn't have a lot of control over what time we went to dinner. So almost every sun-tanning session, every meal, every swim, involved someone else's kids being there. I left mine at home so I could have an adult vacation, so this was not ideal.    Re food: Nobu was great, Malibu Farms was great, Views (lunch place by the golf course) was great. One Forty was nothing special. In fact - another irritating experience happened at One Forty. My partner is young looking. We ordered drinks at dinner one night, and they asked for ID. Happens, but as you don't need cash here, she wasn't carrying her purse. I ask the waiter if they could check the computer, or just trust us that she was legal. She went off to check with a manager. Comes back five minutes later, says that no, we need to go get the ID. This property is big. I'm not exaggerating that this is a 15 minute round trip to our room from this restaurant. But we wanted wine with dinner, so we got up to get it. In the meantime, our appetizers came as we were getting up. They didn't offer to hold them, so they sat out on the table for 15 minutes until we were back. End of the world? Of course not. But was one more little example of hotel employees not finding a way to get to ""yes"". Food at one forty was fine, but nothing special. Definitely overpriced. Stick to Nobu or Malibu Farms (which isn't usually open for dinner).    On the positive side, our room, an oceanfront suite , was beautiful. Spacious, well laid out, beautiful bathrooms, solid amenities. The beach is beautiful with soft sand. Not crowded at all. The chairs overlooking the ocean were great (when you could get them). Our meals at Nobu were memorable and as good as anything we've had anywhere in the world. The services we were able to get at the spa were wonderful, and the activities we tried (snorkel cruise, skeet shooting, guided jeep rental) were great. The July 4th BBQ and Luau were both fun - food at those was nothing special, but the live entertainment was great.",Jul 2021,July 2021,,,

795475590,30,Partial Ocean View?,"The Four Seasons Lana’i is a beautiful resort on a picturesque bay in Lana’i. Well-appointed rooms, pretty gardens with waterfalls and tiki torches, fun activities, and often (but not always) pleasant, gracious service.    Unfortunately, front office and activity booking service is largely where this hotel underperforms, and for the prices they charge and the generally reliable Four Seasons brand, it’s hard not to feel that they are cutting corners at guests’ expense.    I went there with my partner for a 5-night milestone anniversary trip. We prepaid for a Partial Ocean View room through Amex Platinum Fine Hotels and Resorts. When we arrived just after noon from the Sensei, the front desk said that there were no upgrades available (a noticeably frequent occurrence with FHR stays these days, sadly), but our room was ready, and we signed the pre-printed form that stated our already-chosen room number and our Partial Ocean View category. The front desk clerk walked us to our room, and — even when craning your head off the balcony — there was not even a sliver of ocean to be seen. Nothing. It was clearly a Garden View room (see photos). We pointed this out (still not sure why we had to…), and the clerk said he’d see what he could do. We sat in the room for a little less than an hour with our bags still packed, and the clerk called to say he had located a room that indeed had the view we had poid for and reserved, but that it would take a couple hours to clean. No explanation for the mixup or offer of any make good, but we made the best of it and grabbed a yummy late lunch at Malibu Farm. By 4:30, we were in the room we had actually paid for (though our bags took a while longer, and were delivered to the door by a surly older bellman who didn’t offer to put them on racks but lingered for a $20 tip). So 4 hours of waiting and correcting what I can only assume was an attempted (after all, they pre-selected the incorrect room for us) bait and switch of room categories by someone at the hotel. Not a great way to start our beach stay and anniversary trip. But we were there to have fun, enjoy the beach and pools, and celebrate our anniversary, so we made the best of it… And the new room was indeed gorgeous, with a lovely view down the coastline.    Service and warmth were spotty elsewhere too. As a gay couple at a romantic resort, it always a hit and miss experience, but we were largely welcomed with open arms (the restaurant hosts and waitstaff were almost all extremely welcoming and kind). There were some issues by other staff that frankly made us feel like an afterthought. The incorrect pre-selected room and weirdly surly bellman were one, but we had also reached out two weeks ahead to try and book a special “Dining Under The Stars” dinner by the beach for the night of our anniversary, or some other special “premium” experience. After initially presenting it as an option to us, and us checking in several times, less than a week before we arrived we were told that the Dining Under the Stars option was “fully committed” and given the option of a romantic picnic under the stars, where they’d give us a picnic basket and we could find our own place to eat, apparently away from the other couples enjoying their romantic dinner under the stars. It would be hilarious if it weren’t also actually offensive. I asked via email if they could do Dining Under the Stars a different night, and no response. They offered us a 9pm reservation at One Forty, a meat-filled teppanyaki experience at Nobu (I said my partner was pescatarian, so that was out) or room service as the solution. We kept checking once we arrived and secured a slightly better time so that we could enjoy our anniversary. We learned day-of that there was a luau event that night… perhaps that’s why the catering staff couldn’t do our dinner, but it doesn’t explain the picnic basket option (or heck, offer us a good seat at the luau as an option!). I’ll give this the benefit of the doubt and say it was poor communication by the staff, but it was a real disappointment, and one that we had to fix ourselves by constantly checking in on better reservation times. It’s just a lack of care, and not up to the standard of other Four Seasons I’ve stayed at (including Sensei).    Also, a minor thing, but when my partner called to ask about attire for the sunset cruise we had booked, the Ambassador desk clerk suggested an extra layer “for the Mrs.”. Somewhere, someone is not training staff to avoid unnecessarily gendered comments… I would expect Four Seasons training to be a little less sloppy when it comes to making LGBTQ guests feel welcome (and there’s probably a lot of married women out there who don’t want to be called “the Mrs.” too, by the way).    Aside from those unforced errors, and a missed day of cleaning service despite having the housekeeping light turned on all day, the resort was largely what we were looking for. Beautiful grounds, great beach access, good spa treatments, decent fitness center, and a relaxing (if too small, especially compared with Sensei) pool area. Great view from our room, though they sure made us work hard to get the category we paid for. So overall, a lovely resort on the beautiful island of Lana’i, but I can’t really recommend it without qualification, especially to Amex FHR travelers or gay couples looking for a fully welcoming and special experience, sadly.",Jul 2021,July 2021,Traveled as a couple,Watch out for room category bait and switches,"Los Angeles, California"

When we arrived we had a concern that was tactfully and professionally addressed by the front desk staff and the concern was remedied beyond our expectations. We travelled as a family with a child and the resort and island (Lanai) could not have been a better choice. The resort had a mixture of families and couples. The on-site dining is outstanding, Nobu (book the TEPPANYAKI dinner with Chef Hung … an impressive and delectable meal experience), One-Forty and The Break were our favorites.

791600914,50,An experience we will remember the rest of our lives,"We just returned from a 5 night stay here, and it was the hardest time I’ve ever had leaving a hotel. There is a lot to cover here, but to summarize, this is by far the best hotel we’ve ever stayed at, and is the gold standard to which I will compare future hotel stays. I’ll break this review into a few sections:    1. Hotel and rooms  Beautiful location above Hulopoe beach, with ocean and coastline views from throughout the property. The hotel is full of beautifully manicured gardens, as well as koi ponds and numerous seating areas with high end (and comfortable) furniture. There are also several parrots throughout the property that we loved talking to when coming to and from our room. The rooms themselves are spotlessly clean and top of the line, with a fancy Toto toilet, rain shower and separate tub, and incredible toiletries. The furniture was all extremely comfortable but still looked beautiful, and the view from our balcony of the ocean and coastline was stunning.    2. Service  Bar none, the best we’ve had anywhere. It felt more like I was meeting friends and family than service employees. Everyone was outstanding, from the front desk staff to housekeeping, the beach and pool staff and all the restaurant employees and unfortunately I have forgotten most of their names, but a few exceptional individuals were the One Forty hostess at dinner as well as our waiter there. Uncle Bruno, who is the caretaker for the parrots and brings them out to the pool for the guests to spend time with, is someone we spent a lot of time with. He provided life advice, taught us how to weave many different items from the palm leaves, and let us spend a lot of time with his beautiful parrots who all clearly adored him. He made a couple of beautiful items from these leaves for us which we brought back home with us.    3. Food  Amazing. One forty (also the breakfast location) and Nobu are where we had dinners during our stay. Every item was delicious, and the servers were extremely accommodating with special requests. We are still dreaming about the dinner rolls and butter at One Forty. We also enjoyed a few lunches at Malibu Farms. This was definitely the best food we’ve had at any hotel.    To sum it up, yes it’s expensive, but when you look at the outrageous prices some mediocre hotels are charging (particularly in Maui), this place looks like the bargain of the century. It’s worth every penny, and we hope to be back as soon as we can.",Jun 2021,June 2021,Traveled as a couple,,"Granite Bay, California"
790472855,50,Enjoyed Every Second,"This was our first vacation since the Covid outbreak and it was perfect. I must mention that even though we live in Seattle and Hawaii is easy to get to, we have been making the trek to the Caribbean for a couple of decades. When we had small children, we would go to Maui or Kauai for ease of travel. But, we always found it too crowded and busy for our idea of a tropical vacation. Obviously with Covid the Caribbean was not an option. Lanai and the Four Seasons seemed to be just what we were looking for. We were not disappointed! Getting there was seamless. We were met at the Honolulu baggage claim and taken to the private terminal for Lanai Air. After 10 minutes in their lounge we were flown to Lanai which only takes about 20 minutes. From arrival to departure, everything was perfect. We had a partial ocean view room. The pictures of the grounds do not begin to do justice to the exquisite beauty of the jungle that has been created. Plants and trees have been imported from all over the world. It is amazing what has been created, lagoons, water falls, little paths and bridges throughout the property. We were there 10 nights and never tired of eating onsite. We did go to The Views and Sensei for lunch. I must give a special mention to Sarah at The Break were we had breakfast each morning. One Forty was great for dinner but Nobu was our personal favorite. Plenty of lounge chairs always available at the pool and beach where we spent 98% of our time. All the staff working there were great and a special mention to Tuma and Jay. The beach itself is beautiful, very soft sand and a couple of easy walks nearby. The snorkeling is ok. Everyone we encountered was friendly and helpful. I mentioned at the front desk one morning that a light bulb had burned out over my sink. By the time I returned to the room maybe 3 minutes later it had been replaced. Anton in housekeeping was very helpful and a pleasure to meet. Wonderful tennis facility. Bottom line....will we return to the Caribbean? Yes. Will we return to the Four Seasons Lanai?

What we were not aware of was the fact that due to Covid restrictions, the restaurants were at 30% capacity. The hotel never reached out to us before our arrival suggesting we book our dining reservations. Given that the Covid restrictions are very fluid, to be on the safe side I would suggest making your dinner reservations when you book your room. Also, at least 50% of the time, when trying to reach the front desk or the concierge by phone, no one answered.

788465870,50,The Four Season Lanai is another world,"I've been to all the Islands except for Lana'i. I have been to many of the nice resorts with my wife and our family. We've stayed at nice resorts including the Wailea Grand Resort on Maui, and other Wailea Resorts. But when I had to visit the Four Seasons Resort Lana'i for a job, (I'm an adventure wedding photographer who's done some adventurous weddings like Mt. Everest Base Camp), I visited Lana's for the first time, and stayed at the Four Season's Resort. Can I say I have never had an experience like I did with FS. The Guest Services or whatever you want to call it, (the way they take care of people) makes you feel like you are a celebrity. From the time you get on the Island in a Tesla with a team waiting for you at the harbor, to the delicious food, the spacious and expensive rooms, unique calming resort to leaving, you are spoiled. I would love to return with my wife for a relaxing visit. We visited some of the sites on the island for adventure and enjoyed the comfort of the resort. The best resort I have ever visited. I would not take kids here, probably just my wife to enjoy it together. It's more relaxing as a couple, but kids are welcome there too. It just feels made more for adults who want to soak in pleasure and peace, indulge in the clean and friendly grounds, and delicious food.

788364840,50,Amazing Tropical Beachside Retreat,"Spectacular views, lush grounds, luxurious rooms, accommodating staff, and easy access to the beach. We stayed in an Ocean View Room for 5 nights and had a top-notch experience.    (1) Room  We found it challenging before our stay to figure out exactly what the differences among the different room views were. Our Ocean View Room faced west (away from Hulopole Beach) and was on the first floor, which provided for nice views of the ocean, but it was not totally secluded – the rooms in the adjacent building with their lanais were right next to us. We didn’t mind the first-floor room, and thought it was nice to see some of the grounds.  The room itself is well-represented in the photos on this site. Lots of wood furniture and flooring gives a luxurious island feel. The bathroom is expansive and has a tub and relaxing rain-head shower. Toilet includes a Japanese bidet. Each room also comes with an in-room iPad which allows you to communicate directly with the hotel staff using a chat function (for requesting items, asking questions, etc.).  Tip: While we couldn’t hear noise from the room next door, we could hear noise from the room above us (footsteps, etc.). If you are a light sleeper, you should seriously consider asking for a second-floor room.    (2) Service  Staff throughout the resort were very friendly, helpful, and accommodating. We particularly appreciated the staff on the beach who go out of their way to set up beach chairs and umbrellas, and moved the umbrellas for us during the course of the day to keep us shaded. Special mention to Nick who also gave us great tips for good snorkel spots in the bay.    (3) Food  There are several restaurants at the resort. The two main ones, One Forty and Nobu, seem to fill up quickly, so reservations are definitely needed. One Forty has more American-type fare, with great views of the beach in a romantic setting. We preferred Nobu, which had some local additions to their menu in addition to their known signature dishes.  The Break is open throughout the day and offered great breakfast sandwiches and musubi (kimchi chicken was particularly good). Malibu Farms is near the pools, and we loved the menu and outdoor seating. We were also able to use the complimentary hotel shuttle to the golf course (just a few minutes away) to have a relaxed lunch at the Views.  Tip: As mentioned in other reviews, try to make reservations before you arrive, as it may be difficult to secure reservations otherwise.    (4) Amenities  There are scheduled events each day (lei-making, hula demonstrations), but our time at the resort was fairly unscheduled. If you are interested in some of the extra activities, like the Sunset Sail and snorkeling trips, definitely try to make reservations beforehand. We called to make reservations for these activities about 2 weeks before our trip, and already most of the spots had been taken. By the time we arrived, we heard that guests had been placed on wait-lists for these activities.  The gym is well-equipped with Peloton bikes, treadmills, great weight machines and free weights. Staff in the gym were constantly wiping down equipment to keep things clean. There are 2 pools, one adults-only. There were several families at the hotel when we visited; the pools and hot tubs can definitely fill up during the afternoon hours.  While the shared spa facilities were closed due to COVID, the therapists are excellent and the massages rank among the best; we ended up signing up for additional sessions after our initial experience.  The hotel grounds themselves are amazing and well maintained. You feel as though you’re in a rainforest, and we had fun exploring the grounds and seeing all of the many tropical orchids and plants, as well as the many ponds that are filled with koi. Be sure to ask the front desk for some koi food to feed the koi!  Tip: We highly recommend reaching out to the hotel for pre-planning activities before you arrive.    (5) Location/Convenience  During our booking, there was an offer for complimentary inter-island transportation on Lanai Air, which was very convenient. They meet you at baggage claim and take care of all transportation (private car to the Lanai Air hangar included).  The proximity to the beach can’t be beat; it’s just a short walk away from the hotel itself. The beach has very soft sand, and the snorkeling is great. There’s tidepools that are cool to explore, and Puu Pehe (Sweetheart Rock) is just around the corner. For those that don’t like being in the sand, there are also plenty of beach chairs on the hotel property itself with views of the bay.  Tip: If you are interested in snorkeling, we definitely recommend entering the water toward the middle of the beach and then swimming east (away from the resort), where there is hard coral and plenty of fish. While we didn’t see the famed dolphins, we saw a turtle, large schools of tangs and triggerfish, and some very colorful parrotfish and wrasses. Currents and waves can be strong, so it is worthwhile to try using fins.",May 2021,May 2021,,,

Excellent beachside service, including chairs, umbrellas, snorkel gear, and lunch bussed from the resort. Full-service pool deck. We especially liked the finer touches, such as water stations along the hiking trail north of the resort (complete with fresh ice), the traditionally-dressed Hawaiian warrior who ran around with a fire rod every night at sunset lightening the Tiki torches, and the curator who let you hold the hotel’s collection of tropical birds. The only disappointment was the spa, whose facilities fell short of our expectations. We both scheduled massages, which took place in what looked like a former conference room with two massage tables added. I suggest taking the free shuttle to Sansei for any spa services. At the time we made our booking, we received a complimentary air transfer from Lanai to Honolulu, which made getting home convenient.",May 2021,April 2021,,,"Chicago, Illinois"
787569462,40,Review of experience,"We booked our Ocean Front Room 1 year ago. It was a $995 ocean front room. When we checked in we were told they were giving me an upgrade which does not happen for a group rate. When I got to the room it was not an upgrade it was a down grade to the room between suites. We had one nightstand and no room in the closet for long dresses. So I am not sure it was even a standard room but they were assuring me it was. Next they told me it was a handicapped room which it was not because it had a step in shower/tub. A handicapped room has a walk in shower or room to ride in in a wheelchair. Needless to say I was more then disappointed because our Anniversary was in March and we went to the meeting early and stayed longer to celebrate.    A friend of ours put a suite on hold while they stayed in the room that was probably ours. They stayed there for three days until they decided if they liked it and in the end they released the suite and the resort assistant manager Dennis O’Leary gave us the suite for the price of our original room. This man deserves a raise. He made our trip and our celebration of 42 years pleasant.    I would be interested to know how someone can take a room and still keep a suite on hold for 3-4 days until they decide if they want to move. The hotel was hoping he would take the suite for an extra $1,000 a night. In the end they lost money on two fronts, one for hoping the guy would take the suite and then having to give me the suite for the original price of my room. Not to mention our unhappiness with the hotel. They offered us another suite which you could hardly see the ocean and I turned it down because I booked ocean front.    This is the second time I have had a bad experience at the Four Seasons. First was my review of the Four Seasons in Sydney, Australia.    My girlfriend and I our going to Italy in August and we are staying at the Four Seasons this is their last chance to make me happy, 3 strikes and your out so to speak.

787353244,40,A few tips to make a great stay absolutely amazing!,"So the hotel is beautiful, the rooms are on the smaller size, but the beds are really comfortable. If we go back again, we will request upstairs rooms, as you can hear everything above you.  There is an adult only pool, which never seemed to be full, and the family pool was really nice, always busy, and two hot tubs to warm up when needed….    So here are my tips due to Covid:    There are absolutely no toys offered by the hotel, and they say it is due to COVID. So, either bring a bunch of cheap stuff with you - buckets, spades, beach stuff …. And give them to the next family who are arriving when you are leaving! There are no boards for body surfing, so maybe take a trip into the town and grab a couple for the kids.    The beach is a little bit of a walk from the hotel, so make sure everyone has flipflops as the stones are really really hard on your feet, and hot! The waves are strong a lot of the time, and we had an afternoon of ‘gorilla waves’ that we panicked and came into shore! They do provide snorkeling gear, and that was fun to do. The hotel also has snorkeling trips, fishing trips etc so there is stuff to do away from the hotel.    Fun club for the kids: we were told we had to provide passports for the younger kids to prove they were 5 or above; it was quite a struggle with the hotel to prove their age, eventually they accepted the Kid’s Covid tests as proof of their age. ALSO, due to Covid, they only allow a few kids at a time, so try to either book ahead, or book your kids in as soon as you arrive at the hotel. A few quests were disappointed as they could not get their kids booked into the club the whole week we were there.    The TV’s in the room show that you can stream from your phone - Netflix etc, but you actually cannot do it. There is a hotel app you download, but movies are $15 each or more, HOWEVER, if you bring an hdmi cable with you and the cable to attach to your phone …… BINGO, you are all good! I will post a photo of what I had and then I streamed movies for the kids from my iPad.    Bring fishing nets for your kids - we got them online for $3 each, and the kids used them all day every day as there are thousands of little lizards around the property. They never got sick of chasing them, and the kids all got together in a little gang and spent all day searching for them ….. we made little dens for the lizards each day, and then the kids started again the next morning.    The food is great; kids 5 and under eat for free if you are ordering food. Breakfast was always amazing, and the staff go above and beyond to make you comfortable, I cannot fault the staff in the hotel at all …. I have seen other reviews, but that was not my experience. Everyone was wonderful. Incredibly friendly. Got to know you really quickly.    Tip: Lunch is Malibu Farms, totally delicious …. Kid’s eat for free again at the restaurant - if you order around the pool you pay for the kids meals.    Staff came around with frozen mint patties for the guests, frozen pineapples, lollipops for everyone …..    Bring snacks if your kids munch all day; the hotel store doesn’t sell snacks etc.    Really a beautiful trip, it isn’t a crazy FUN hotel, it is definitely more laid back, a lot of families there, but nobody was ever on top of each other.    Book restaurant reservations when you book your hotel ….. due to Covid, seating is limited, and some families we spoke to couldn’t get reservations when they arrived. We all said that it is a shame that you aren’t sent out an email with this kind of information before you come, as it would have been invaluable. But again, the staff did as much as they could to make your stay great.    We have friends going this coming week, so we have them well advised, and they are going stocked up and well planned!

787060568,50,HEAVEN!!!,"If you are on the fence, just book it! Our trip started off in Honolulu, we were met at the airport by a driver and taken to the private hangar. From there we boarded the private Lanai air jet to fly us over. The jet was gorgeous, fairly new, and had about 6 seats in it....although it was just my husband and I. After a quick 30 minute flight we landed in Lanai and showed our QR codes to the staff at the airport (we had spent a week in Oahu so needed to get another covid test to fly inter-island)....which was completely empty. We were then met by our Four Seasons host and driven to the property in a Mercedes Sprinter Van. Check-in was quick and then we were escorted to our ocean view room. The room was gorgeous, modern, but still had a Hawaiian feel to it. I especially loved the bathroom, it was like my own mini spa. They also had a small fruit arrangement welcome gift waiting for us in the room as well. Malibu Farms during the day was great to have lunch at by the pool, but my favorite had to be One Forty. We had dinner at One Forty every night and it was so good! The overall ambiance at One Forty is just amazing as well, dimly lit, and very romantic. We also did lunch at the golf course as well which was just as good! The beach was nice, but surf can be a little strong at times so just beware. I also loved how there was hardly anyone at the pool...I think the whole time we only saw two other couples. Also, at night we went to the hot tub and stared at the stars and no one was in sight so we felt like we had the whole place to ourselves. The other resort Sensei is adults only and more of a wellness retreat vibe and you are not walking distance to a beach, but instead more in the mountains. I think of Sensei has more California, yoga retreat style. Also, at Sensei your dining options are way more limited.

785512079,40,"Outstanding property, hit or miss service","We'd heard about FS Lanai for years but didn't think it was a good idea with kids (very young kids yes but above 12, not enough to see and do) so this was our first kid-free visit to the islands. The property itself is stunningly gorgeous, even just walking to your room is a picturesque stroll. Our room was perfection, esp the lanai. Transport from Oahu was seamless and easy. The ""ambassador"" who picked us up from the Lanai airport was very friendly, informative and helpful. Unfortunately all talk and no action as none of the things he offered to do (restaurant reservations, Jeep rental) ever materialized and we never heard from him again! We then tried to make reservations ourselves via text message to guest services only to be told that there were no reservations at all available at Nobu for our five nights and one or two late reservations at One Forty, and nothing for lunch or dinner on Valentine's Day except The Break which is like a cafe. Super disappointing and how can you have a resort hotel on an island with almost nowhere else to eat and not be able to accommodate all guests? I pointed out this out and somehow reservations materialized two nights at Nobu and one at One Forty. Both restaurants serve outstanding food. Everything we ordered was superb but inexplicably both times at Nobu, it was nowhere near capacityl (and it was socially distanced seating). The second time we ate there, my husband asked to have the same table we had the first time and was told it was reserved so we had a table at the back near the closed sushi bar. It didn't bother me but it bothered my husband as the table (along with two others) remained empty the entire time we were there. We were going to try one of the restos in Lanai City but it was full so we had room service from One Forty -- the snapper we had in the restaurant on our first night is perfection -- and then room service again after cocktails at the Break on our last night. The room service creme brûlée was excellent. I'm not normally a fan of room service but FS usually gets it right. What I don't understand is now both FS Lanai and FS Hualalai do not have enough reservations to accommodate all guests. Where do they expect guests to go? We were told to make resto reservations prior to arrival; for me it kind of defeats the purpose of vacation to have everything scheduled. In any case, the meals we had in the restaurants were five star and service was excellent for the most part. Food at the pool was a disappointment, which we found very surprising as we've had poolside service at FS in Maui, Hualalai, Palm Beach, Dubai, all were outstanding. The fish tacos we had were absolutely tasteless. Luckily the cocktails are delicious and potent. We had the Wagyu burger the following day and that was up to usual FS standards. We had a similar experience at the Break. The granola yogurt breakfast parfait was inedible with stale granola and soggy overripe fruit but they have excellent cocktails, calamari and a delicious cheese plate, even though the cheeses we were served were not the ones listed on the menu. Kudos to Tyler at the Break, super friendly great guy, as well as Gerard at the pool, and all the guys at the beach. Oh, the one super disappointing cocktail was the mai tais my husband got us from the Break upon arrival. We are not normally mai tai people but when in Rome. I think it must have been the normal bartenders break or something because other cocktails we got the from the break were excellent. We spent most of our time at the beach because the sea here is just incredibly inviting and beautiful and we love to snorkel. And the adult pool was not very relaxing as there were loud drunk guests in the adjacent hot tub from midday until the sun went down. We took a couple beautiful hikes and rented a Jeep to see Garden of the Gods, Polihua Beach and Shipwreck beach. the Garden and Polihua were worthwhile but Shipwreck beach was full of garbage everywhere, much of which looked like it washed ashore. Lunch at the Malibu place at the golf course was delicious albeit a bit windy and again, we had to pretty much beg for a reservation only to find it very sparsely seated when we arrived. It's bizarre. We did not have turn down service any night but one and then we had an item go missing from our room so use the safe at all time. This was a fluke, normally we do but as we had not had turn down the previous two nights, we did not expect anyone to go in our room. Our return back to Oahu was nowhere near as nice or safe as on the way there when we were picked up in the hotel Teslas. We were chucked into a van with three other couples, and then got to the airport only to find that for some reason our departure time was delayed and we had to wait 45 minutes in the van. We did not understand this at all and it could have been told to us prior to leaving the hotel (it was not weather related). We missed our reservation at Pearl Harbor by five minutes but so we waited for the last entrance of the day and luckily made it in (Many waiting guests did not). To be honest, as much as my husband and I both LOVED this resort - the beach, the food, the room -- I'm not sure if we'd return. It was nowhere near capacity so I can't imagine what it would be like when full. Plus -- and this is a big fault in a resort of this standard -- you can hear everything in the adjacent rooms. It's annoying. The people above opened their lanai slider every morning at 3 am, as well as flushed the toilet and made phone calls to family back east. I'm not a light sleeper and they woke me up. Hence why I rated noise at this hotel as ""loud"" because of the room and the oblivious adults in the hot tub drinking all day. Loud kids in the kid pool or the beach, I can deal with and expect. Last but not least, we thoroughly enjoyed the yoga classes",Mar 2021,February 2021,,,"London, United Kingdom"
785314807,50,The perfect getaway!,"FS Lanai staff go above and beyond ensure a memorable stay and the property is as good as it gets. The privacy, beautiful rooms/suites, and 5 star service are evident from the moment you arrive.    We enjoyed a weekend here in early March and have already booked a return trip in May! From  NOBU to 140, to a 5 star room service breakfast in your room, FS Lanai provides everything you want to relax and enjoy!    The Ohana Suite is over the top, the views, extended lanai, and Japanese soaking tub instantly transport you to a vacation mindset. Great to entertain or simply enjoy the extra space.    We have visited before but took advantage of the new Sensei spa at the FS property up the road and choose the couples experience (private hale). This was an over the top spa especially in light of current Covid restrictions, having a private space with all private amenities is especially appreciated. The outside pools and showers are something we can’t wait to try again. Don’t pass on this.    In the past we have rented a keep and driven to shipwreck beach. We would do this again too, and recommend this as an activity!

785050645,40,Almost 5 star but missing on some important features,"We have visited the Four Seasons Lanai three times. This was our first visit since the renovations that were completed in 2019.    The resort is beautiful with copious amounts of foliage and greenery. Just walking from the room to the lobby is a treat as you can observe monarch butterflies, various birds, and lizards. We felt like we were in a botanical garden. The room itself was spacious, comfortable, and high tech. The lights and drapes were controlled by buttons on the wall. The bedding and pillows were very extremely comfortable which pleased my wife as she suffers from fibromyalgia and chronic pain. She found she had very little pain while sleeping on these cloud-like beds. Transfers from HNL to the Lanai airport on Lanai Air were seamless and hassle-free. This was appreciated especially after the long flights from the mainland. Food was generally good especially at Forty-One for both breakfast and dinner.  As a wonderful bonus, there is a resort aviary for rescued tropical birds that is a must visit. Beautiful Macaws, Cockatoos, African Greys, and others. Look for Uncle Bruno at the family pool between noon and 3pm to visit. My wife fell in love with the Cockatoo named Griffin and cried when she had to leave.  Covid-19 protocols were observed by staff and guests and we felt safe over the entire visit.    I only awarded the resort 4 stars instead of 5 stars for the following reasons:    1. During our five-night stay, we did not receive turn down service once despite asking at the front desk every day. The front desk representative apologized and indicated that turn down service would be provided but the service was never performed. At the end of our stay, we told the front desk that we never received turn down service and the representative stated that we should have notified them. After stating that we did notified them every day, the representative apologized, shrugged and ask if we had the do not disturb sign on. We were careful not to have the do not disturb sign on and felt like we were the blame for the lack of service.  2. The beach is beautiful, not crowded and the attendants were friendly and accommodating. However, the chairs, tables and umbrellas were not the quality one would expect at a 5-star resort. The quality of these items were better at both the adult and family pools.  3. Nobu was crowded every night and difficult to secure a reservation. When we did manage to secure a reservation, we found the food to be average and not in the same league as other Nobu restaurants in the US and around the world.  4. No welcome drink or Hawaiian Lei upon arrival and no recognition of anniversary.",Mar 2021,March 2021,,,United States
784978196,50,Paradise but Spotty Service,"My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights during our babymoon and my senior parents traveled here as well. After taking the ferry from Maui, we found the shuttle and learned there was another family staying at the hotel with our same last name. We thought it was funny at first since it is not a common last name in the US but it continued to cause problems for both families during our short stay. Bookings were constantly mixed up and they congratulated the other family for the pregnancy when they weren't expecting. I can't imagine it is the first time two unrelated families stay here with the same name and considering the Four Seasons reputation I would expect them to handle the situation better. Service throughout the restaurants was spotty and there were language barriers which masks only made more challenging. Overall food was poor to average but I was expecting that with no other competition.  However we are giving our stay 5 stars because the venue and rooms are one of a kind and we realize the poor service could be due to COVID. The rooms are stunning and the bed is luxurious. The bathroom is even stocked with a Dyson haridryer. The views are stunning everywhere you look and it was a very tranquil environment. My prenantal massage was very relaxing and felt safe during COVID. Beach service was great and tranquil. I definitely recommend lunch at the Views for the best food at the resort and atmosphere.

784500068,30,"Four Seasons ""ish""","We love this brand, but this property did not have the same level of service. It felt like an upscale Marriott. While we feel incredibly fortunate to have been able to visit this hotel for our 15th anniversary, we did not feel it lived up to the awards. We don't usually go to Hawaii, but we planned the entire trip JUST to stay at this hotel. Upon arrival and throughout the stay, there was no celebration of our special event (usually, there is a card or a bottle of bubbles).    The pool service was prolonged. You cannot sit at the adult pool and see the ocean; this makes you feel like you could be anywhere. But we were in Hawaii and would have loved to have been able to sit at the pool and see the ocean. There are chairs where you can see the ocean, but you are not at the pool.    We have stayed at the FS Costa Rica, Maui, All over Mexico, Bora Bora.... and I would recommend all of those. For the time it takes to get here, it was just ""fine."" I will say the pilots and the airline on the way over were exceptional. I DO want to give one shout-out to the FS Lanai. We had to leave early as our childcare fell through due to a medical emergency, and they were terrific at giving us a refund. We did have a problem when we arrived at the airport; there was no plane scheduled. However, they quickly remedied the problem and got us on the next plane out.

It's a very convenient way to fly to Lanai- no long TSA lines, waiting for checked baggage, etc. We booked the partial ocean view room for 5 nights.  Our room was spacious with a large lanai and a sweeping view of the ocean and coastline. Everything in the room was simply perfect, as can be expected. The bathroom is a good size as well. The resort has two swimming pools, one for adults only. Hulopoe Bay is a short walk from the hotel. The resort has staff at the beach to help guests with towels, chairs, umbrellas, food/beverages and snorkeling gear. The grounds include waterfalls and Koi ponds- stunning, lush and well maintained. There are many seating areas around the hotel to relax and enjoy the views. There are several dining options  on the property. We tried all including the Views at Manele Golf Course.

782705737,50,Tennis with Ryan Winters at #fslanai,"#fslanai is an amazing place and great destination. Regarding tennis, I spent three days with Ryan and thoroughly enjoyed it. What sets him apart from the usual teaching pros is his deep understanding of how to play the game AND how to teach this. This is quite an unusual combintation in my experience. In addition to cleaning up some strokes with minor tweaks, we worked also on positioning during singles play, changing grip pressure and feel, and how to read situations and the opponent. Also, how to play with more ease and less fatigue and injuries. I also found that he had a great eye toward noticing all kinds of details in my game. I highly recommend some sessions with Ryan if you'd like a ""tennis workshop"" to accompany your vacation in an island paradise. Mahalo, Ryan, and #fslanai!",Feb 2021,February 2021,,,

They are really working to keep things clean and safe during Covid. We especially liked not riding in a vehicle with others. They used Teslas to transport us much of the time. That being said, there are a few comments we have that they weren’t quite up to par on. They seem to struggle with service even though there aren’t many guests.They failed to tell us upon check-in that we needed to return to the front desk on day 3 of our visit for a temperature check. We couldn’t figure out why we couldn’t get into our room so we went to the front desk to have them reprogram our keys. They explained they should have informed us of the mandatory temperature check ahead of time so there was no confusion. They didn’t. On another day, we needed to be in the lobby at 1:15 for the 2:30 ferry to Maui. It was a 5 minute drive down the hill, and there weren’t many people taking the ferry. We sat around for over an hour after checking in at the ferry. Some of the adult pool attendants are really more interested in conversing with each other or in checking their phones than servicing the area or checking on the guests. Another day, we were to be in the lobby half an hour before transport to an activity. We waited and waited. They finally told us to board the vehicle. They were loading luggage in the back and the driver asked if we enjoyed our stay. We said we were not leaving. We were heading to an activity. Well, they had us exit the vehicle and wait for another one for transport to our activity.    This is an expensive property, but it is very lovely.

760732269,50,So beautiful and amazing service.,"For those who are Kamaaina (Hawaii residents), this place is amazing. We can’t go out of state because of quarantine mandates, and this place was a great alternative. We took advantage of a Kamaaina special that included airfare and hotel stay through Four Seasons. They arrange transportation to and from the airport. They have private shuttles for destinations around the island.    The grounds and lobby are amazing. A lot of plants and foliage make it a private paradise (but beware of a few bees and wasps if you are allergic). I don’t think anyone got stung, but it is something to think about.    There are separate pools for families and an adult retreat pool (21 and over only). A short walk to the beach where they have a stand for towels, setups (chairs and umbrellas), and drinks. If you walk further down the beach, there is a stairwell leading to fish ponds. Very slippery so wear rubber reef shoes.    Restaurants are pretty expensive (Nobu, One Forty) but for a quick bite at a more reasonable price there is The Break. But the food quality for all of these is outstanding, and the views are spectacular.    The rooms are so amazingly exquisite. A lot of outlets which are always needed. Control pads all over the room control the light and shades. And there is a iPad mini you can use to explore the amenities, restaurant menus, and communicate with the front desk. The bathroom is wonderful with separate shower and tub, double sinks, and a water closet. Toilet has bidet and warm seat. There is a TV in the bathroom mirror for relaxing in the tub, and a Dyson hair dryer.    We explored the grounds and fed the Koi fish with food from the front desk. The room key is in a silicone wristband so it’s easy to take with you swimming at the pool or beach. Everyone there makes you feel special and it is definitely a first class experience.

As a single woman in business, having never found Mr Right, I told myself - when I turn 50 I am going to give myself a huge party even if nobody else does. Well the 4S Lanai was my party for a week!    The room was beautiful as before. After a long 14 hours of travel I arrived in my room and there was a chocolate birthday cake, pineapple and fruit treats and a handwritten note from the manager wishing me happy birthday in Hawaiian and welcoming me. I felt so at home and cared for from the first moment .    I found the spa to be amazing. I had the best facial of my life, The massage was so good I went back for a second session. Dinner at Nobu looking over the Pacific was amazing. The ""sunset cruise"" set up by the hotel concierge was so much more than that. Our trip had spinner dolphins following, or actually leading the boat for aver 40 minutes, pods of whales, and a gorgeous sunset where they played IZs version of ""What a beautiful world"" while we took pictures.    After the sunset cruise experience, there was a local musician playing in the hotel lobby with hula dancers. This was really lovely.    The beach is basically perfect. No big crowds, lots of space. You can go for a hike from the beach if you like to a cliff with hidden secret beaches below. I was fortunate and the weather was great every day.    For people who read negative reviews of this location I can only say - consider the source. This is not a place for partying and night life.

750093573,50,Luxurious and Relaxing,"Overall- we loved this hotel. Wife and I were coming from 5 days on the big island where we had done most of our activities (adventurous side). Coming to Lanai- we just wanted to relax. Unfortunately there is no longer a direct from Kona to Lanai so we had to connect in HNL (Lanai air would not pick us up in Kona either even for $$).    We had a chance to visit the lounge in HNL airport at the beginning and end of the trip before long flight home. This was very nice and very unique. Do not know of another property that has an exclusive airport lounge in a major hub like HNL (not like Bora Bora or Maldives, etc). Staff was excellent on both visits and helped expedite check-in, etc. Communication between staff members is seamless and all updated on one main computer system (believe it is Oracle based- go figure).    Upon arriving- we were whisked to the hotel and check-in was prompt. We were in a partial ocean view room which was very nice. The hotel is larger than we expected as it is very long as opposed to high/tall. Our room was a solid 5 minute+ walk to the lobby- which was fine except when forgetting something in the room during the day.    Breakfast was beyond fantastic. We booked with a four seasons preferred partner so that got us daily breakfast (buffet or in-room) + $100 F&B credit. We have stayed at a number of FS properties and love being able to dine for breakfast in the room when there is a nice view such as here. The buffet was so great that we opted to go there physically every morning. Our server (name begins with a D) has been there over 20 years and was wonderful. Morning #1 he recommended we try the macadamia banana nut pancakes (neither my wife nor are ever really eat pancakes). Lets just say we ended up splitting a stack every morning in addition to made-to-order omelettes, smoothie bar, excellent bakery and pastry items (the multigrain and sourdough breads were delicious)- AND a small dim sum selection + poke and sushi (at breakfast?!). I was set on having Poke daily- and with having a little sampler at breakfast each morning brought my daily consumption to 2-3 meals of poke per day.    A couple small hiccups- we were actually upgraded to a better ocean view room on night #2. We sat on our lanai and read our books while waiting for our bags to come. Two hours later they had still not arrived (we were relaxing, not in a rush so not a huge deal...but still...). Roberto- a manager at the front desk more than took care of this for us and made the small but glaring error right in our eyes. Thank you Roberto!    Very windy the last few nights we were there so the sunset sail kept getting canceled sadly. Book this early on in your trip so you at least have a chance of moving it to another night.    Spa was fantastic. Had a couples deep tissue massage one morning. They took us to a couples suite above the spa. Spotless facilities- great steam and sauna and robes (and nice to know the spa facilities are open to guests during their entire stay- not just with spa appointment).    Gym was great. I think 6 peletons- most I have seen in a hotel gym. Very spacious- all brand new equipment kept in great condition and gym was also spotless.    Yoga- we did sunrise morning yoga twice and sunset Yoga once. Sunset with Akiko was great. We did it on the Luau grounds and there were only 4 of us (including my wife and I). Everyone was decently well experienced so Akiko moved the difficulty up a bit and made it more of a workout (she kept saying, ""hold this potition for 10 more seconds and you get another cocktail at dinner!""). She was great and it was a really nice way to wind the evening down before dinner. We did sunrise morning yoga with Raj the next morning (our last). It was raining to we did it on the Yoga studio and it was just my wife and I private class! Raj was great and catered to our skill level so we had a nice hour session with him. Definitely take advantage of the free yoga!    Dinners- Nobu- not much to say. It meets the standard of all the other Nobu's we have been to around the world. We sat at the bar one night and just had sushi and sake which was great. Second night we ordered all our favorites plus some local specialties.    We did not dine for dinner at one forty- we skipped our reservation and order room service and sat on our Lanai which was great. A little windy and buggy but it was worth it for the views.    Malibu farms was great for lunch and drinks everyday.    Go have lunch at the views at the golf course if you have time! The views are amazing and its the best lunch on the island.    Whales and dolphins were everywhere! Migrating whales passed by the shore all day while we watched. Some even coming in very close to shore and putting on breaching shows! Spectacular! A large pod of approx 40 dolphins coming to Manele most mornings. It is illegal to harass any marine mammals in the US so you should keep your distance. The hotel will not give our snorkel gear while the dolphins are there (usually in the mornings) so bring your own. They are in the bay resting from open water and have many young dolphins in the pod. They swim all over the bay with (unfortunately) many hotel guests and locals/tourists with their own snorkel gear chasing after them. I went in the water one day closer to the reef on the far side (great snorkeling) and without needing to chase or harass- the pod swam by me 8 or so times during my hour in the water. Awesome experience.    Hikes- we did the fisherman's trail one morning. Go early! It is beautiful but very hot with sun rising. Bring water too. About 1 hour there and back and follows the cliffs along the golf course.    We also did the hike up to sweetheart rock anther morning. This is a must! so BEAUTIFUL.    All in all amazing trip and we hope to be back in the near future",Mar 2020,February 2020,,,"Boston, Massachusetts"
748312751,40,Great but expensive resort,"As you’d expect for a Four Seasons this resort is beautiful, exceptionally well staffed and kept.    The beach is lovely too.    The issue for most visitors (unless you like lounging around the pool for days) is that there is only so much you can do In Lanai. A one day Jeep rental lets you drive every single road and trail on the island.    There are no shops, restaurants anywhere outside the resort. The only town on the island (Lanai City) is not tourist oriented.    To conclude it is an expensive but exceptionally nice resort on an island that while beautiful has limited things to see and do. Great for a short visit to take Lanai off your bucket list!",Feb 2020,February 2020,Traveled as a couple,,"Wells, Maine"

There is a full staff as the beach that takes service to the next level. Also, the resort is beautifully maintained. The food at the resort is also incredible. The staff is also very attentive. The rooms are also state of the art and beautifully decorated along with the whole hotel. It's an oasis of garden and beach as the grounds are so lush. Also, the golf course is top-notch.

Everyone knew us by name even if we don’t remember meeting them.  I had a 90-minute facial. First time I had one in a spa. It was amazing. She massaged my face, arms and legs. She steamed my face which was nice as I was congested. She gave my skin a deep cleaning. I felt amazing afterwards.  When I left the spa I threw my robe into the hamper. I forgot that my diamond bracelet and watch were in there. When my husband David came out of his treatment, they had it waiting for him to take back to me. I was pleased were honest.  They have rescue birds which are cared for by a man named Bruno. Everyday he takes the birds out so people can interact with them. I was thrilled one day when the cockatoo put his head down for me to pet him. I was told when I take my hand away do it fast, so he doesn’t nip me. It was fun saying aloha and a few of them answer you back.  The food was good.  We went to Nobu a few times. The have the best bar in the resort. The bartenders are amazing and extremely friendly. Anthony, Megan and Kuma were awesome. Gerry the hostess was also awesome.  at one forty we also had great service. the manage Loretta was extremely friendly and great at checking on the guests.  The hotel arranges for a 2 hours sunset cruise. It was a catamaran. The crew was fantastic. The appetizers were good. We saw the tail of a baby humpback whale. We did see an amazing sunset.

There was no one to help load & unload the luggage. The Hotel Staff  should be at the Ferry to assist Guests both coming  & going. The service at the Hotel was scares.  There simply wasn’t enough help servicing  guests. Service at the beach was dismal. The  Spa cancelled my time by accident after insisting  it was my error. Poor mismanagement.    The Restaurants were only “ok”. Having only two  choices every evening was boring. Nobi  was average. Getting seated was dismal.They had numerous tables open, but they made us wait two hours to be seated. Shortage of help existed at both Bar & Restaurant. We waited 25 minutes to get drinks.The Bar was not jammed -simply ill managed. The other Restaurants food was “country club”- service was spotty & the cost exceeded at best mediocre food. Drinks were no problem ordering- over serving seemed the norm.    While we were at the Resort there were two  Conferences being hosted. It’s difficult to deliver excellent  service when the Hotel has to decide who they are catering to- It was evident that the shortage of help exacerbated the situation. Charging extraordinary rates for Food, Drinks and Guest Rooms should equal Quality Services.    A toast to improvement!    PS  Don’t sign up for horseback riding.

743995886,40,An almost perfect stay...in a Lana'i Paradise,"My husband and I love this hotel, island, staff and resort amenities. If you are interested in fun diversions from the stunning beach and lounge chair relaxation there are dozens of different excursions and activities from which to choose. We are active so here is my 10 day short list: Aerial Yoga - a blast!, Hiking, Horseback riding, 4x4 island exploring, ATV touring, Snorkeling, Cultural presentations and activities, GOLF!!!!, skeet shooting (first time ever and actually really fun), Pistol/marksmanship range (also way more fun than expected) Garden tours, Sunset Cruises, Whale watching, Spa experiences - Amazing!, Stargazing, Dinner under the stars, canoodling. :-) After our first stay in 2018 we longed to come back. I decided to book a 10 night stay for his birthday as a surprise and we arrived on the island thrilled to have a beach vacation with all these Four Seasons Resort activities and amenities at our finger tips. Taking Lana'i Air from Oahu is a superb experience. Seamless connection to our Pilatus plane despite our delayed arrival. Our escort greeted us at the gate as we deplaned in HNL and we landed on Lanai less than an hour later. Incredible! The hotel is beautiful, the gardens are stunning and the service and food are excellent. I was able to SCUBA dive on M-W-F of this trip and was excited that this activity had been added since our last stay. Our visit was sadly tainted by some ongoing issues in our room that were challenging for the hotel staff to rectify and this detracted from the level of relaxation in which we hoped to indulge. The management met with us, were conciliatory and did what they could to solve our issues but alas some of them were not fixable before our departure. I would still rate my stay as very good but wish I could unreservedly say it was excellent. Although I emphatically would return for another stay my husband's frustration with the unresolved issues in our room leaves him feeling ambivalent about a return to Lana'i. The room itself was gorgeous with beautiful finishes, a stunning beach vista and a supremely comfortable bed. I rate the room AVERAGE only due to the issues that kept us from letting go of the cares and worries that we hoped to escape on our Lana'i sojourn. Even so I think the staff are exceptional and worked diligently to make our stay special. They are a great team. Even with glitches, this is my favorite Four Seasons in all Hawaii. It feels like the whole island is the resort.",Feb 2020,January 2020,,,"Seattle, Washington"
743418313,50,Romantic Beauty and Tranquality,"We just returned from our third FS Lanai visit however, this was the first time we stayed at this hotel versus the Lodge at Koele. It was nice to see the renovations of the grounds but the pool is a miss in my mind. The old pool area took advantage of the magnificent views of the Pacific Ocean and Manele/Holupoe Bay and this remodel makes it almost impossible to see when swimming in the pools. The old pool also had a very nice bar with seating that allowed for magnificent views and they tore it down and moved the bar off to the side with no views. They should have made one large (or several smaller) infinity edge pool with swim up bar, like in FS Maui. You can see the views from the hot tubs and from the many lounges set up along the lower sections, but we had a cabana closest to the ocean and they actually planted plants in front of your view (see-attached pictures). I have no idea who actually allowed them to block a million dollar view from your cabana with plants but management needs to correct this. I would not pay for a cabana, as it was not worth it since you do not receive anything more than from the lounges that actually have wonderful views. In addition, the pool service was sub-par. We did bring it to the attention of management and did follow up with us, but we should not have to flag down servers for three days in a row. Some were much better than others were but some acted as if they were not happy to be there at all and did not interact with the guests in the normal friendly FS manner. In addition, drinks were slow and when I ordered a margarita, different from what was on the menu, it took three times to get it correct because the pool attendant did not engage with me. They could also serve much higher quality drinks in the pool areas. They had middle-shelf alcohol brands, such as Capt. Morgan for Rum and not a great craft menu choice of drinks. The rooms however are absolutely amazing in all aspects and live up to the FS standards and then some. The upgrades they have done with the technology of these rooms is magnificent. From the fully automatic toilets to the automatic lights and shades all controlled from different locations throughout the room for convenience. They have an iPad in the room allowing you to chat via text for any service or question, order your food, or obtain valuable information at any time during your stay. They also have water bottle refill stations conveniently located throughout the resort (they will hand you refillable aluminum water bottles upon arrival but you can also bring an insulated bottle and it would be very useful throughout your stay). We also upgraded to an ocean view suite, which was worth the money, as the views and the ocean sounds made the trip so relaxing. All in all the resort is a truly spectacular place to unwind and do nothing in the tranquility of lush gardens, ponds and magnificent views. They could use some improvement in their service from some of their staff as compared to past visits, some just seem checked out and uninterested. Luckily it was not the norm and there are plenty employees that are friendly and happy to serve such as the drivers, the house keeping staff, the front desk, The Break staff, and the room service.",Feb 2020,February 2020,,Upgrade to Ocean View or Ocean Front for the sounds of the waves and the views,"Coeur d'Alene, Idaho"

Very kid friendly, we had our 2 year old here..who I'm sure annoyed some guests at times..but the family pools are really well laid out and everyone gets the peace they need. What is especially nice is how compact and intimate the whole resort is, eveything feels really accessible and close by. Restaurants are expensive, but take into account where you are and that you only get to experience it once in a lifetime or two and you'll consider it worth it. The absolute best part about the FS Lanai is the staff, they are really exceptional and deserve a huge shout out. We only encountered incredible staff here everywhere who all genuinely seem to really enjoy working here, which I hope management appreciate and take great care of.

742552382,50,Heavenly experience in Lanai,"Stayed at Four Seasons at Lanai this time for our annual trip to Hawaii. The overall experience is one of the best I ever had. It helped that we got an upgrade to a suite with a center view of the pool and the sea from a far. Strongly recommend, if you go, for snorkeling (beach and boat), sunset sail and hiking on Puu Pehe. Oh, on sunset sail, we encountered so many Humpbacks (~10) and 100s of dolphins. More than we could in the lifetime! Or just relax on the poolside with a great view to the bay and dominating view of Maui, or golfing on the impeccably managed Manele GC. Food choices are limited and pricey in this secluded env, but it's one of the best. Stay at least 3 nights, and we stayed one more night in Ohau after this so we could spend more time here on the morning of departure day. We had lunch at the Views at the Manale GC on departure day, and man, it was one of the best decisions I ever made. From where we sat, saw many bridging Hampbacks, and the weather was so perfect we could see Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa, 80 miles away from us.

Great views of sea and sky with shuttle service to tiny Lanai City.    No television was watched here.

741831219,50,All Things Great and Small,"First, a thank you to the Four Seasons for helping this local couple feel welcome and showing us such great aloha. We've stayed at many of the high end properties here and this was truly something special. And I think what really put you over the top for us were all the little things that you did that might be overlooked at other places. Or perhaps it was a warm, welcoming and gracious staff. Or ... an amazing property in general.    We flew in from Honolulu on Lanai Air which was a super enjoyable experience, and out on Hawaiian Airlines with a stop at the lounge in Honolulu (which was a delightful surprise, another small but meaningful touch). Room was super nice and there is nothing I could add to what you've already done as a suggestion. Gym looked great although we didn't use it and a perfect temperature. We went out on the catamaran for the snorkel two days in a row we enjoyed it so much. We were glad we brought our wetsuit shorties and rash guards with us as the water was a little cool without them. Beach was really nice as well, yes, no alcohol allowed but there were plenty of places in the resort for that sort of thing with great selections. We enjoyed Nobu tremendously and their house chardonnay was a nice surprise! Only negative was service seemed to slow down a bit toward the end of our dinner and I suspect the presence of a large group of financial advisors having an event may have been part of it??? Still, was all good and would definitely go back there again.    So despite my wanting to offer you folks there at the resort some helpful feedback I just don't have much ... you are awesome. I see some of the negative reviews here are nit picky in the extreme ... really, the gym isn't cold enough for you???    So we're already starting to think of our next visit with you. You're our favorite resort and we've stayed at a lot of them!!! I think next time more of our visit will be on the back, perhaps give the spa a go, and try the other restaurant we missed. You had so many activities, many of them complimentary, I know we've got lots to look forward to. Please don't change too much until we get back there later this year.

740715255,20,Poor customer service,"Note: I have not actually stayed at the hotel..I have a booking for March 2020. However, I want to describe a (very poor) customer service experience. I called the Reservation desk and asked about transportation from the Lanai ferry dock to the hotel, as I planned to take the Ferry from Maui to Lanai to begin my stay. The reservation's agent (who was based at the hotel) told me the transfer fee was $123 (!!!). When I questioned the transfer fee the agent very flippantly transferred me to a manager. I repeated my ""story"" to the Manager about needing a transfer from the Ferry. Instead of answering my question he handed me back to the original agent. She then told me that fee was really $20 (plus tax...and she emphasized the ""plus tax"" part). I said that was more reasonable and ended the call. I then went to the Four Seasons web site which states transfers from the Ferry were at no charge. Ok, the agent was wrong. But her phone attitude was very bothersome to me so a day later I called the hotel (this time the Front Desk) and asked to speak to a Manager. I wanted to relay my experience of the previous day with the reservations agent. I was then told that the ""manager"" was away from her desk but she would call me as soon as she returned. I gave my name and phone number and awaited a callback from the ""manager."" None came. So, I am pondering whether it is really worth spending $1200 per night at a hotel with staff that care so little about pending customers.",Jan 2020,January 2020,,,"San Carlos, California"

The staff was universally great, the resort itself is beautiful and the island has great appeal for us as it is uncrowded and beautiful. Don't let the cool temperature reports from Lanai City concern you as the Manele Bay site of the resort is much warmer and was perfect for our January visit.    We were initially concerned about not having enough to do but the resort has thoughtfully created some unusual and creative activities. The initial draw for me was the fact that there is a great mix of things not normally found in a resort setting. The sporting clays course is great as is Dennis the manager/instructor. Perfect for experienced shooters as well as someone that has never shot before. The boats for fishing, snorkeling or diving are first class and the staff is most accommodating. The Jeep rentals make this beautiful, but rustic, island accessible and the remote beaches are beautiful and sparsely populated.    There are essentially 3 restaurants on site all of which are great and there is enough variety to keep us happy for the week+ that we were there.

737143101,30,"Beautiful location, hotel not up to 4 Seasons Standards","We recently returned from a five night stay at the Lanai Four Seasons. We have stayed at Four Seasons properties all over the world -- LA, NY, SF, Paris, Istanbul, etc. We also use as reference points the Waldorf Astoria in Chicago and the Peninsula in Chicago, both of which are really tops in terms of customer service. This was not in that league.    First, it was incredibly difficult to get decent reservation times at the restaurants, and once there, service was mediocre. The ""table side poke"" was not done table side (and was much lower in quality) occasionally, and things like diet cokes took a long time to arrive. Some of the restaurant staff was excellent, and others were mediocre.    We appreciated that the hotel allowed us to fly on their plane back to Honolulu, where we took United back to LA. However, on the way to Lanai, we asked our contact at the hotel about how the commercial flight was from Honolulu to Lanai on Hawaiian airlines and were told it was just fine. Anything but... our luggage was lost, the flight was a mess, once we realized our luggage was lost the procedures for getting it back (involving standing on a line for a half hour while exhausted from travel, waiting for airline staff to deal with the dozen or so folks with missing bags) were horrible. We were told that bags get lost routinely. Had the hotel contact told us this, we would have sought other options.    Additionally, the room was extremely warm at night and the A/C would not go to a comfortable level. When paying what we were paying, we should be able to set the A/C where we want. We understand the desire to be ""green"" but we are paying for comfort and deserve it at these prices - going sustainable on the backs of guests paying more than you pay at Post Ranch (our favorite place to stay, and quite pricy) is not the ideal way to go.    The gym had very nice equipment and a great view. I appreciate the investment in woodway treadmills and wish more hotels did that. However, the temp was over 70 (probably over 72, maybe even 75) and this is not safe for aerobic activity, per the IFA and OSHA. It was incredibly uncomfortable. The gym was routinely packed, as the demographic of folks staying at this location is a fit bunch, and a number of folks noted this. With the number of folks in the room, the temperature increased as well. It's understandable that with the sun beaming in, it's going to heat up the room -- but take some of the money you get from the exorbitant room rates and refrigerate the place. Other hotels with gym views do this.    We toured the renovated wellness/fitness hotel that's also run by the Four Seasons and felt that had more wow factor than the beach resort, although we did not stay at the wellness retreat hotel this time around. We do plan to go back to check that out. We really enjoyed our stay, but feel that the tweaks above would be helpful to really take this hotel to the level of the top resorts worldwide.",Jan 2020,December 2019,,,

732088659,50,One of the best Four Seasons locations,"Effortless is the best way I can describe arriving. We were able to take Lanai Air for both our drop off and pick up to Lanai. Having a private flight over to the island really does make it feel extra special, even if it is only about a 15-20 min flight.    Upon landing in Lana’I the hotel has someone already there to pick you up in a new Tesla Model X and bring you to the hotel, all included in what you pay for Lanai Air. Which I cannot recommend enough.    The hotel itself is truly incredible. My wife is vegan, so I was a little bit cautious to go to a small island with very few options, however I was very relieved to hear that all restaurants had Vegan options. They were even kind enough to email me a menu for each that had highlighted vegan options. Nobu is one of my personal favorites and it was my wife’s favorite place that we ate while on Lana’I.    Make sure you checkout sweetheart rock, which is just about a 30 min walk from the hotel lobby, it is well worth the hike/walk.    The room was absolutely fantastic, I booked an ocean view room which had an amazing view, a walk out patio and comfortable seating. We were on the west side of the resort to sunsets were perfect.

731425145,50,Our favorite resort in the world,"We have been coming here for decades through Luxury Collection days to Four Seasons days both pre and post renovation. As against other places to go worldwide, many beautiful for sure, Maldives, Seychelles, Phuket and so forth, we keep coming back to the notion that Hawaii is our favorite.    And when we think about Hawaii, there are a few very excellent hotels that are authentic and really do go above the mass produced albeit held-out-as-luxury model of say the Fairmont hotels, Grand Hyatt Kauai or so forth. Its just not possible to be highly authentic at that 500+ rooms level. You get to smaller places like the Montage Kapalua or maybe even Andaz Maui which do have that authentic charm, excellent food, beautiful locale and for the most part no rushing for chairs.    But then you get to Four Seasons Lanai. It is the most private, serene, de-stressing place of them all. Frankly for years it has boiled down to the location: as early as 1939, when Dole had a small not-open-to-the-public hotel here for company employees, if you drill into the history, Manele was from the earliest time cited as one of the best, if not the very best, snorkeling, swimming and fishing beaches in the State. Some 80 years on, nothing has changed. The beauty and relative isolation of the spot drive the whole experience here at this hotel. Just a 3 minute walk down the hill is this place, so unspoiled, where the dolphins come to rest and sea turtles swim around, where the reef just abounds with life. Snorkeling and swimming here is truly a pleasure and this is really what Hawaii is all about.    This is where its worth mentioning another strong contender - Four Seasons Hualalai. It's terrific, and no disrespect meant, but the point of juxtaposition of these two resorts (in addition to Lanai being harder to get to and as such just simply more exclusive and quiet) - is the presence of this wonderful Manele Bay beach that is lacking at the Big Island location.    Framed against this, so what of this newfound luxury of Ellison days? We'e sold. So we miss the grand lawn and big pool? Sure, that was nice. My oldest kid learned to swim in that pool. It was epic, honestly. But Manele is essentially a desert landscape and I can appreciate the need to get rid of grand lawns and go for landscaping that is more conservation based in nature. They did a nice job, and the aesthetics of the grotto pools and the overall better use of space is a plus.    Everything else is just spot on without missing a beat: caring and dedicated management, out and about making sure things are going well, available to chat and friendly; great food (absolutely, positively the best breakfast in Hawaii even slightly beating out Ka'ana Kitchen at Andaz Maui which is spectacular) and importantly, good mid-day pool food which is often the biggest miss in Hawaii resorts; well designed and clean room; outstanding kids club staff and activities (my kids have quite literally cried when leaving ""Auntie"" and her staff...); intricate and well kept grounds; on and on. During our most recent ten day stay - these was not one small thing wrong. Nothing.

726679346,50,Blissful tranquillity and peace,"My husband and I saved for years to celebrate our 25th anniversary at the Four Seasons Lanai and we had a glorious time. Just walking around is a meditation in beauty and calmness. The rooms are set in tropical gardens with waterfalls, streams, and bridges that look completely natural--if nature were perfect. Truly, the Four Seasons' setting is as spectacular as any botanical garden in Hawaii. The indoor decor is also lovely. You pass through all of this on your way to a breakfast that is the best breakfast buffet in Hawaii, overlooking the beach. Bryan (I hope I remembered his name correctly) is an enthusiastic explainer of each of the fabulous exotic fruit, and prepares a great omelet. We went to the beach every day and had great service from the people there. Everything is calm and uncrowded and the snorkeling off the beach was very good. The water was wonderfully warm--no shivering and squealing getting in the water. At night we fell asleep to the sound of the ocean. The yoga, whether in the studio or on the beach, was wonderful. I felt so completely peaceful and happy, it is hard to describe. The highlight of our trip was the botanical tour with Robert Woodman, who runs the entire landscaping program at the Four Seasons and is tremendously knowledgeable and patient. And that introduces one of my only cavils--the Four Seasons does not tell you about all of its offerings to guests. No one told us about Woodman's tours--we stumbled across him giving a tour to another guest. No one told us that a New York Times digest was available for the asking behind the desk. No one told us about a presentation on the Hawaiian language--we saw the poster for it after it had already happened. No one told us that one of the restaurants was closed for renovation--its menu is still on the Ipad in the room. The Ipad's menu listings do not correspond with the actual menus of the restaurants (the food is spectacular--I preferred 140 and my husband liked them both). My husband said I should mention that if you pay more than $800 a night for a room they should not have one ply toilet paper, and I have to say that I agree with him. But that being said, if we win the lottery, we will be back.",Nov 2019,November 2019,,3146 was set in the most lovely gardens...,"Rutland, Massachusetts"
726390189,50,Absolutely perfect!,"My wife and I just returned from our honeymoon on Lanai + Maui. We spent the first 3 nights at FS Lanai, and we both agreed it was our favorite hotel experience ever. First off, we decided to take Lanai Air on the way over, which made for an unbelievable start to the honeymoon. If you have the opportunity to take this (at least one way), go for it. We were the only two people on the plane, so it felt like a private jet. They escort you right from baggage claim on Maui, which was particularly helpful after such a long trip. We landed on Lanai and were promptly shuttled over (in a Tesla) to the hotel.    We were instantly blown away (even at night) by the property, and how stunning the open air lobby was. It feels like this place opened last week. We booked a partial ocean-view, and we had a few honeymoon-related treats waiting for us. The room is extremely high-tech (particularly the bathroom), and the bed was super comfortable. Only one minor complaint about the room: it’s not THAT well-lit. Not a huge deal. When we woke up the next morning we saw just how beautiful this place was. It has a jungle/rainforest feel – almost like a retreat. They did an amazing job designing this place. The online pics don’t even do it justice.    We spent our two full days by the pool. It was slow season so there were plenty of chairs. Never was an issue finding two we liked in the sun. The service by the pool was exceptional. They set us up with water + towels, came around with frozen treats, and were very quick with food/drink orders. The pools were nothing special (more of a lagoon type feel) but they were sufficient enough. We didn’t go to the beach but it was only a 5 min walk down there and it was also fully staffed. Again – the service here is just insane. The food by the pool (Malibu Farm) was also excellent.    We ate at both restaurants. One Forty was amazing. One of our favorite meals of the honeymoon. Nobu wasn’t as great – but we had a few items we really enjoyed. The breakfast at One Forty was excellent – great buffet and a la carte items. Service was again A+ (recurring theme, I know).    The lobby had a show each night (with complimentary drinks + apps one night) around sunset, and there was live music the 2nd night we were there.    Just be prepared – this isn’t the place you go to for nightlife. You go here to totally unwind and relax, which is exactly what my wife and I were looking for, before moving on to Maui for a week. The lobby scene really does die down around 8pm, which we were perfectly OK with.    Overall – a truly incredible stay! This place is just special. Hawaii is a far trip for us – but this is 100% worth coming back to. We were planning this honeymoon for a while – and the reviews convinced us to make the trek here. If you’re planning to visit Hawaii – you absolutely should make this hotel part of your trip! Only problem – it really has now spoiled us – we’ll be unfortunately comparing every hotel to this one.",Nov 2019,November 2019,,,"Boston, Massachusetts"
726315362,50,This is my Hawaii!,"As first time visitors to Hawaii, we arrived in search of our Hawaii. Our first stop in Maui was lovely yet was not what we were looking for. Within minutes of arriving in Lanai at this gorgeous resort, we changed our plans and made arrangements to stay here for the rest of our time in Hawaii. Our third and final destination in Kona had just informed us that they had several temporary greens at their golf course and that wasn’t cutting it for us, as we are golfers.    We loved everything about this stunning resort. The buildings are beautiful with magical gardens throughout. Our second floor room was stunning with a tremendous view of the ocean. We did not close the blinds for privacy once! Our room was so quiet, beautifully decorated and soooooo comfortable. We felt completely at home!    We loved the parrots with their shy “alohas”, the Koi fish in the ponds and the chirping of the birds in the evening. I loved walking out to our deck in the middle of the night and seeing the starlit sky. I felt like I was in paradise!    We ate our delicious meals at One Forty, Nobu, Malibu Farm and The View at the golf club. Every bite was delicious. I especially enjoyed the artistic morning lattes, brioche french toast and feel the beet juice at breakfast. One night we were fortunate enough to make a reservation at Sensei Nobu at the new Four Seasons Lanai at Koele. What a spectacular spot and a divine dinner! When we return to Lanai, we will stay a few nights at this Sensei Retreat- wow!!    We golfed five rounds at the Manele Golf Course where every hole has a stunning view. The course was quiet and in immaculate condition. The staff at the course took great care of us and put our experience over the top.    There is a lot to do on this quiet island. We took a snorkelling excursion, went horseback riding, swam in the waves at the beach and started our days hiking the picturesque Fisherman’s Trail. We hiked to the Sweethearts Rock at one sunset and every day lounged in chairs overlooking the ocean. We went to the spa twice and loved the treatments we received. At every turn, the staff was outstanding, taking care of us with a smile.    We picked a great time of year to visit. The weather was perfect and we did not see a mosquito.

726100856,50,A slice of paradise,"You get what you pay for certainly applies here- our stay was amazing as were all the restaurants and activities we did.    The 4 Seasons is not my typical brand of hotel, I'm usually a Marriott, Sheraton, Westin type person. The price point was hard for me to swallow going into it, but once I arrived, that thought left my mind because everything was so wonderful. In terms of the higher pricing, I liken it to vacationing in a foreign country where the exchange rate is unfavorable to the USD $- you can't do control it, so rather than dwell on it, let it go and enjoy the trip.    The experience is so consistently enjoyable that it's hard to choose a favorite thing because it was all amazing. The highlights of my stay were:  -Polaris off-roading (we asked our driver to go fast and hit up to 50 mph on straightaways)  -Snorkeling with the hotel's gear at the beach (a fellow guest I met said the snorkeling on the beach is just as good as what you see if you go out on the snorkeling boat tour)  -Booze cruise, aka sunset cruise. You really get your money's worth on this one- free drinks and appetizers. We saw a bunch of dolphins, including baby dolphins, and enjoyed the view and sunset too.  -Botannical tour (free) arranged by the front desk and their landscaping director, Robert. The tour goes over the gardens that surround the hotel and is about 60-90 min long.  -Poolside massage. We took a later 6pm slot and got our massages under the moonlight and in silence since no other guests were poolside at that time.  -Crafts table in the lobby area- they had stamping and lei making on the days I stopped by.  -Beautifully designed room (and ALL surroundings) with an amazing bathroom. The bathroom has a shower, tub, and toto toilet.    There is an ATM around the corner from the lobby, but smaller bills are also handy to have for tipping when there's no bill to sign (beach umbrella/snorkel ppl, cruise, polaris, airport shuttle, any activity listed as gratuitous in their activity guide, etc.).    As a vegetarian, my favorite restaurants were Malibu Farm and Nobu. I'm hoping once the sports bar reopens they have a good veggie burger, like Beyond Burger available, as I was really craving a burger by the end of my stay. It also felt weird not to have any water fountain for reusable water bottles anywhere and to have to rely on only bottled water (free in gym and in the room). Although the island has limited water supplies, I wish the hotel could be more eco-friendly on this and by having recycling receptacles in the room or elsewhere.    The cat sanctuary was another favorite part of my trip, but transportation to & back is not provided by the hotel. I used a taxi service listed on the sanctuary's site, but hope that over time the hotel can offer this as a stop to their shuttle loop that goes to Lanai City.",Nov 2019,November 2019,,,"Los Gatos, California"

Just so happened it was World Series last game day, and we were eager to go to the pool bar and watch the game and have some drinks and maybe a light lunch...Nothing open except the small bar early afternoon. Bar was empty when we arrived..only seats about 10 or 12 at best. NO TV..What?...so we ordered drinks from Patrick,and was shoved a small ramekin of bar nuts(size of a custard cup??...really)and soon the bar began to fill,all looking for the TV and curious of the scores.So I turned on my cell phone and kept everyone up to date. Patrick had the personality of a rock,was business only and I wondered if this was because he was trained this way,or he was just dull. My husband and I polished off the handful of bar nuts and the empty bowl sat there empty till we left(small thing,but not good for ambiance) We slid empty glasses to alert him we wanted more, and he complied....SO SAD....spend over 1000 bucks a night and have to ask for service...but he was sure quick with the bill for over 100 bucks...We won't be back.But I will say that dinner at the Lanai Hotel in the little city was fabulous,and the drinks spot on,and the server happy to converse and share laughter, and her tip showed our happiness dining away from the stuffy,uppity Four Seasons....Maybe Larry Ellison should stop by and order a drink and just sit back and watch the show.....and then go down to your Hotel Lanai and see the real aloha feeling. (FOUND OUT YOU OWN THE BOTH)...Maybe he should have his bartenders and Patrick go train there for a while....and please do not come back and tell me that everyone sometimes has a bad day....For what you charge,your staff should leave their bad days at home.....but we did have fun talking to the people at the bar and watching the game on my phone.....check out the rates on the Lanai Hotel before you book the Four Seasons for money well spent and a great Ohana feeling...Say hi to Sarah for us...",Nov 2019,November 2019,,"5 star rated,.....you decide,I am not impressed","Sacramento, California"

723874337,10,Saddened and Disappointed,"First let me start by saying that our stay at the Four Season Lanai was to celebrate our engagement. This was discussed with the reservation agent that completed the reservation and also communicated via email with the concierge team. We are permanent residents on Oahu and have always wanted to visit Lanai, so to celebrate this special occasion we splurged and paid $1,000 for an ocean view room. Unfortunately, our stay at the Four Season Lanai was far from special.  We had requested through the concierge email communications to have 1) an upper level room so that we could sleep with the door open to hear the waves at night, and 2) to have champagne/mimosa in the room up arrival, NEITHER of which was accommodated. The hotel was not even near capacity so I am not sure why they could not accommodate the room request, and champagne should be a simple room service feature that also could not be met by the Four Seasons staff.  Luna checked us in, did not acknowledge our engagement, nor ask if we were celebrating any special occasion. We felt rushed as she walked us to our room, without a property tour of the grounds. When we arrived to the room, and I told her that I had asked for an upper room so that sleep with the door open she just shrugged it off and said that it would be safe to leave the door open on the ground floor. Of course we did not feel comfortable with that, so needless to say the two simple things we requested were accommodated by the Four Seasons, nor did we feel they made any effort to attempt to accommodate these very simple requests. When you pay $1,000 per night, I would expect some type of acknowledgement and a higher level of service.  We took the complimentary shuttle into Lanai City and then hiked the Koloiki Trail, which offered some stunning scenery. We walked back into Lanai City and had some wonderful, fresh sandwiches at Blue Ginger Café. The shuttle picked us back up at Hotel Lanai to drive us back to the Four Seasons. Jeffery (sp?) was a very kind driver and provided interesting conversation.  Before going back to the room, we stopped at Malibu Farms for a drink. The drinks were good and cost $17 each. Funny thing is, the Four Seasons website lists Malibu Farms and a Sports Bar on the property, but it is actually the same bar and they just change names around 5PM/6PM. Strange.  When we arrived back at the room there was a message on the phone. They were calling about our check out the next day and flight information for transportation to the airport, which I had provided to the FOUR times already. Frustrating and inconsiderate. I would have thought that the Four Seasons would check to make sure all the accommodations were suitable and check to see if we needed anything, before asking about departure information when we had just arrived about 4 hours earlier.  That night we went to Nobu for dinner. Meghan (sp?) at Nobu was a very nice girl and she really sold the menu for the Four Seasons, but the quality of the food is sub par. We went with recommendations and had the roasted brussels sprouts (drenched in way too much lemon sauce), yellowtail sashimi (good), crispy mushroom salad (ok), and the local catch tempura (bland and flavorless). Something else that was very disheartening was that we ordered a bottle of 2016, and I repeat as it is stated on the wine list, a 2016 bottle of Matsuhisa Private Selection Cabernet Sauvignon. As we are sipping the first glass of wine, we notice the bottle actually reads that it is 2017. I brought it to Meghan’s attention and she went back to ask, but came back and said she was sorry, but they were out of that vintage. They should have told us this from the beginning or should have given the option to select something else, neither of which they did. Between dinner and drinks, our bill before tip was $298. Again, I would like think taht a Four Season Resort would hold their restaurants to a higher standard, and also never thought they would have tried to be sneaky about the vintage of wine. Beware and check what you order if you order a bottle of wine!  The following morning, we were in the bath and a staff member just barged right into our room at 10:30AM, without even knocking or announcing her entering our room. I screamed so loud she ran back out. No call to apologize, nothing. Check out time is 12PM, and as we were walking toward our door with our suitcases at 12PM, they were knocking on the door.  This resort is not dreamy, it is not worth $1,000+ per night, and the staff and level of service has MUCH to be desired. This resort is way over priced for the quality of service. We just really felt that we were dismissed during our stay. It was disappointing that our engagement celebration was not even acknowledged. We have stayed at other much less expensive resorts and hotels that provided so much better service. I would highly suggest staying at the Westin Hapuna on the Big Island or the Ritz Carlton on Maui. At either of these places you will spend 1/3 of the price as the Four Season and you will be treated to much higher standard.

720477675,50,Stunning!,"We stayed at the Four Seasons Lanai for a part of our honeymoon. Upon check in you are greeted with leis and a drink. My husband requested an upgrade since it was our honeymoon and the assistant manager helped us get the Ohana Ocean-View Suite. This room doesn't seem to get booked often since it is very expensive and just ocean-view not front. Our balcony faced all greenery. With that said, it is 100% worth it and might even be better than ocean front. You have so much privacy! Let me start with how insane the rooms are. You can tell that whoever did the remodel pay attention to every detail. The toilet was was automatic and the seat would even warm up when you sat down! Everything had touch screens and the linens/decor was so clean, stylish and sophisticated. The pool was beautiful. You couldn't get alcohol at the beach which was a bummer but you can still get fun fruity drinks and food. For food, the breakfast was great, Malibu Farms had the best burger I've ever had (we had it 3 times I think) and dinner was also great. Nobu is obviously expensive and the quality/taste is consistent with other Nobu's. The only bummer was the lack of special honeymoon writing on the dessert we ordered (small but goes a long way). I've been to many luxury hotels and even for birthdays they go the extra mile. When we checked in we had chocolate covered strawberries and champagne which was amazing though and appreciated!! The shampoo and conditioner were my favorite from all of the places we stayed on our honeymoon. They have great activities like horseback riding (Mary was fabulous) and the UTV riding was AWESOME! We were bummed at first when we found out we couldn't drive and then happy when we didn't. The locals go fast and make it so much fun! I will say the staff all seem kind of new and like they are learning about the property. We asked about the sunrise hike and the guy at the front desk had trouble finding a map and wasn't sure what we were talking about.

An EXTRA special acknowledgement goes to Angelique for being the Coordinator sent from heaven. She did so many other little things for us that, “Thanks for being you”, is just not enough.    The single greatest reason we chose Lana’i for an intimate wedding was that the resort only does one wedding a day; ONE. Brides, this means that your special day is YOUR special day. We have seen many beautiful weddings at many resorts but more often than not those weddings were “competing” for time/space/staff with other wedding processions occurring before/after/during.

This hotel has a lot of work:    1. Restaurant is terrible. Both the steakhouse and Nobu. At Nobu, we were reminded 3x that last call was 930. Could not enjoy an expensive meal with this constant rush. Sushi - fish was ok, but rice needs work. Not authentically prepared. Wasabi was not freshly ground. Rice to fish ratio was off. Steakhouse - $90 rib eye was cooked medium well. Dry and flavorless.    2. Room - Overall room was nice, but annoying that many things did not work. IPAD not working. Took one day to fix. AC not working in the morning. Took one guy 1 hour to come, and was never fixed! Scale not working, fixed within 30 minutes. Various other issues.    3. Staff - for this level hotel, staff seemed not genuine and service was not 5*. Especially at beach. They seemed lazy. Tried to rush people out before sunset. Started putting furniture away early.

The airport in Honolulu has a private Four Seasons lounge just for Lanai where we did our check-in. It was awesome. Free shuttle to and from the airport/ferry.    Rooms: Pure luxury. They have 75 inch TVS which are awesome. Everything modern, up to date, and clean. We got a Garden room but still had an ocean view. It was beautiful. Loved the bathrooms. Has a full Toto toilet, the one where you don't have to even touch a thing - self-flushes, cleans, even senses you coming and opens the lid. Has a nightlight along the floor of the toilet too. Loved the bath products - they were all natural, paraben, sulfate, phthalate- free.    I had a massage one day that was great - I wish the amenities and common areas in the spa were bigger. The changing area is so small only 1-2 people can fit at once. So the actual spa area was nothing special, but the massage was really good. My husband golfed at Manele Golf Course and said it was one of the best golf courses he's ever golfed at.    Food - they were doing construction so the Sports Bar was closed. We ate at Nobu 3 nights which was delicious and at the steakhouse one night. I do wish there was one more option to eat at. The steakhouse was not very good. The service at the restaurants could have been better, the servers didn't seem that knowledgeable. Breakfast was really good - they have kombucha on tap and you can customize a smoothie. We also had lunch at the View, up at the golf course, and it was good, worth going.    Pool - I didn't love the pools, there's only 2 - one with kids and one adults only. They are both small. However, the view is beautiful and relaxing. Throughout the day, attendants came by with little treats - ie. frozen bananas, frozen smoothies, etc. They even came by and cleaned our glasses. The service was pretty slow at the pool though - we always had to find someone to set up our towels, order a drink, or order food. You could see them standing around talking, so you had to go find someone to order. Sometimes there was no one around. We had to go to the pool restaurant to order drinks and food since we couldn't find any pool attendants anywhere sometimes.    Overall it's a beautiful hotel and would go back. However, the common areas, especially the pool are small, so I wouldn't go during high season as it would be way too crowded and you wouldn't find space at the pool.

Spa was wonderful. It's pricey, but worth a splurge.    Try the poolside venison nachos. A unique but delicious snack.    While getting here was a 25 minute flight from HNL to LNY, I'd caution this routing. Leave plenty of time to make your flight if you originate out of HNL. The Hawaiian Airlines terminal is disorganized. Security lines (including precheck) were understaffed and very long. Signage for Ohana check in is wrong. The actual lobby is at the opposite end of the building from the sign. Little staff around to assist.

713288925,50,"A refreshing, inspiring, and restorative place to reflect, slow-down and recharge.","I came here to be alone for one week, and my husband joined me the second week. I needed a time-out from daily life, and to hear myself think again. I chose Lana’i on the advice of a friend who had visited and assured me I wouldn’t regret it. I loved it.    First, everyone is genuinely kind and helpful. The pool and beach attendants, the parrot caretaker, the spa therapists, the Nobu sushi chefs (my favorite guys!), the ambassadors, the drivers, hiking guides, and the yoga instructors (Will and Raj are exceptional).    I enjoyed so many of their activities. I loved the shooting range and found a great instructor in Sid (who also supplies the most delicious eggs for the island) and soon was hitting clay pigeons with great enthusiasm. Golf on the ocean cliff with Kendrick was spectacular (and so is their daily lemonade). The snorkeling trip isn’t to be missed and if you’re lucky you’ll get to see the spinner or spotted dolphins which are spectacular. If you’re really lucky Junior or Captain Dustin or Captain Kristen will find you an Octopus.    Sunrise yoga with Will or Raj provides really gentle flows and a mindfulness practice as the sun rises over Haleakala. Breathtaking scenery and an inspiring practice is a great way to begin everyday, and a nice memory to take home.    The rooms are a sumptuous respite after a day in the sun. If you have an ocean front room, you’re lulled to sleep by the waves at night.    I’ve stayed at many Four Seasons and this experience is head and shoulders above every other. It’s a combination of the people, the place and the program. The team is thoughtful, practical and kind.    Thank you all.

The highlight of the trip was the excursions. The ATV ride around the island was informative and very fun. The food at Nobu and the other dinner restaurant (I forgot the name) was great but not amazing. Service at the pool was wonderful, and I appreciated this as so many luxury FS properties lack in this regard. Paola, one of the managers at Nobu, was amazing and we had the pleasure of speaking with her for a very long time at dinner because my family is in the hotel industry and she has a great background in the industry. After we spoke with her, one of the hotel's managers came to us at Breakfast on our last day and spoke with us, which was a lovely personal touch. The hotel's grounds are absolutely stunning. Ellison has a wonderful eye for landscaping.    As for the negatives, the pool itself is underwhelming (but the views make up for this) and the Malibu Farm was lame. One of the front desk agents, who was very friendly at first and escorted us to our room, was giving us weird looks as we saw here throughout the rest of the stay. For example, she wouldn't greet us as we walked by her throughout the property, which all other staff were so diligent in doing. I have no idea what ""offended"" her, but this issue was minor. Also there was a noticeable incident at the pool where a woman had a masseuse massage her in front everyone at the pool area. What? Why is this allowed? Every other FS resort property has at least tents that they offer spa services in. I'm sorry, but I don't want to watch a stranger's gross back rubbed at the pool for 45 minutes. These are just some minor issues that I think are easily solvable.    But to end on a happy note, it was a very worthwhile stay and I have no doubt that this is the best FS property in Hawaii.

706152121,50,Blissful retreat,"The 4 season on lanai is a wonderful escape in a tropical paradise. Every detail is thought out and provided for, even details you didn’t know existed.

You can go wrong...whatsoever.",Sep 2019,May 2019,Traveled with family,,"Princeville, Hawaii"
705938366,50,What a stay!,"We returned to Lanai for a 10 night stay after 5 years away. All I can say is wow!    The renovations that we noticed 2 years ago (we came thru for a single night in 2017) are as good as they appear to be at first glance.    Positives:  Hotel is clean - staff is Four Seasons and Aloha attentive. Everything is taken care of in a professional manner.    Rooms are beautiful. We got a free upgrade (don't count on that happening - we were surprised when it did), and the room was fantastic. Bathroom with the separate shower and tub are beautiful. The toilet/bidet combo unit is a very nice touch. Large TVs in each room. Lighting controls for easy on off even from your bed. Blackout shades do a nice job controlling the early morning light. Bed is super comfortable (IMHO), did not have any of the normal 10 days and now your back hurts a little issues. Turn down service as well as maid service can be scheduled (they ask you the time frame on check in). And (in a change from previous years) - they do honor the do not disturb.    The pool area is very beautiful. Staff is attentive. Pool itself is very nice, and the hot tubs ( there are 3 of them - 2 by main pool, 1 by the adults pool) are clean. The adults pool is close by (unlike FS Maui).    Beach area is, well, I feel this is one of the best beaches in Hawaii. Beautiful waves all day to play in, and just beyond the break is calm water for snorkeling or swimming. Saw a Ray swimming by one day right near the shore break.    The sunset/cocktail cruise is a good deal. They let you set anyway - including out on the nets. Got to see dozens of dolphins that jumped and played with us as we sailed by. Drinks are not held back and food (appetizers) was good.    Restaurants on site are nice. Did not do Nobu, but the breakfast is great and dinner was so classy at 140.    Negatives:  Ok I have to get real picky to find a negative...    The screens in one of our 2 rooms are off by about 3/4 inch so it would be possible for a bug to get in if you leave the doors apen to the lanai and close the screens. Unlikely, but possible.  A couple of the staff at breakfast were very slow. Molokai level slow. Had to stand up to get check brought to us.  We had a roach (big tropical style one) in one of my shoes one morning. He came back that night (had tossed him out the door with shoe. But after he got squashed, did not see any others at any time.    The Malibu Farms menu is a little odd, and they seem to LOVE arugula. I mean way too much of it. (2+ inches on a sandwich. Chill a little people.    The staff that cleaned the downstairs lobby area bathroom (by the restaurants) and some of the wood down there in the morning didn't seem happy. He was always looking angry. Didn't do anything, but looked that way.    Other items to note:    The sports bar will be undergoing renovations soon. It is still a great place to hang out in the meantime and I am sure the new setup will be great.    The new deal with the shuttle buses (having to schedule your rides) is a bit disconcerting at first. But you get used to it. It is a change from the old way.    We also drove up by the lodge, it should be doing a soft opening this month or in October. Looks nice, but it will be different.    In any case. this place is what you expect from one of the highest rated hotels in the world. It is worth every penny (if that is possible) and will not disappoint you.",Sep 2019,August 2019,,"All rooms are great. We love the garden view one, but got moved to partial ocean view.

703369013,50,very nice,"perfection if you want a secluded luxury hotel without crowds, etc. Stayed 10 days, great service but would not mind a minimal effort on staff part to remember our name -- constant mix up with other guests and staring at computer screens. Service generally outstanding but ""experience"" desk treats guests a bit like babies. They ordered my wife to take shuttle bus to yoga studio, which is exactly 50 yards away, refused to let her walk. And then forgot to order the shuttle. Nobu is a chain, but had multiple delicious meals. A wine list with more interesting modestly priced red wines would be nice. Housekeeping, beach staff, etc, outstanding.

701866374,50,Lanai Honeymoon,"We chose to go here for our honeymoon. Overall great experience. My biggest disappointment was that I booked an ""ocean front room"" and later found out that the room directly below us was considered a ""partial ocean view"". So a $500 a night difference for just one floor? I would've much rather stayed in the room below us for $500 a night less (exact same view?) So I would take that under consideration when booking. Nice for a honeymoon since it's secluded. Food was AMAZING at every restaurant/pool, the beach and pool were fantastic with incredible views and service. My favorite golf course I've played in Hawaii (most fun, have course to yourself and spectacular views on pretty much every hole). SPA is small and was under construction so had to get couples massage in a guests room. Kind of disappointing when you spend $1k +. Hard to beat though if you're looking for a secluded romantic getaway.",Aug 2019,August 2019,Traveled as a couple,,
700881750,50,Amazing Hotel and Island,We stayed here for 5 nights in August and it was the highlight of a months vacation exploring Canada and Hawaii.    The island is beautiful and completely unspoilt. Very much recommend hiring a jeep and getting out to see the remote beaches. The island feels very different to other parts of Hawaii.    Our room was amazing and luxurious and we loved the beach and jumping the waves.    The staff were all lovely and in particular the staff in the Kids Club who went out of their way for our two girls.    Nothing was a problem at the Four Seasons Lanai and I really hope I get to go back.    It is expensive but there are few places left like this gem of an island left in the world.,Aug 2019,August 2019,Traveled with family,,
698763376,50,Amazing,"We stayed at the four season in Lanai, it is an amazing place with lots of nature around it.

698704014,10,Not worth the price tag - not for millennials - so many problems - not relaxing,"I'm all about luxe hotels, and while this is a nice one, it really misses the mark. However, the grounds are beautiful, we loved meeting the sweet people of Lanai and are happy this hotel gives them a job.    We were there on our honeymoon and mostly saw 50+ older couples with teen children. This hotel is for baby boomers, not Millenials.    First off, we were greeted warmly but overwhelmingly by many people. We were then asked if we wanted to pay to upgrade or room, and we felt like we were being sold to to try to pay for an upgrade. We said we were on our honeymoon, and the hotel was by no means sold out - so they could have upgraded us for free if they wanted to but instead had us tour rooms before we saw our own that we could pay up to $800 a night more for (when it was already $1,200 +).    Staff - The front desk staff we interacted with didn't know what was going on and gave us confusing answers about many things. Including when we asked for the room above us for a better view. She said it would be an extra charge (even though it is still a partial ocean view). We were told we could switch rooms after we had dinner. We get back, pack up our stuff and surprise two hours later the room isn't ready (now 10 PM) and I'm dying to go to bed. They also were SO CONFUSED when I asked for a mini-fridge with no drinks in it. They didn't set up my husbands surprise champagne and strawberries and delivered it after we were in our room.    Room - The rooms were tiny and really had a weird set up. Not modern or traditional just blah decor all wood. Everything is digitalized which means I couldn't control what lights were on and off, they all are set to turn off and on together. There needs to be better lights in that room, it is truly odd. YOU ALSO CANNOT TURN DOWN YOUR THERMOSTAT LOWER THAN 68. Even at 68 with the fan on high and air on high, I woke up every night sweating. There is a giant TV on the wall (totally unnecessary). Our Lanai was tiny as well. Toliet was the best part about the room, but again this is someone only 50+ plus would care about. You can not get your own ice.    Pool - My husband was legit threatened at the pool for bringing in his own beer and water. They legit said they would call security if he brought in his beer, even though I ordered drinks and food and spent $100+ at the pool that day. There is no music AT ALL at the pool (not even a light music)    Beach - You can not have alcoholic beverages at the beach. This isn't the hotels fault but major downfall. They also will not give you rides up and down the pathway by golf cart to the beach (which is steep and hot) even if you ask. The beach was too rough for me to swim in and I got wiped out by a giant wave and wouldn't go back in the water there.    Food- The food at Nobu and OneForty is undeniably delicious. HOWEVER, YOU WILL SPEND $100 ON BREAKFAST FOR TWO EACH DAY. There is no other option. Even ordering a-la-carte and not the buffet, it is super expensive. I've never seen a buffet of $48 a person before. Nobu was the most expensive meal we had on our entire honeymoon in maui and lanai and it was the least memorable.    Activities - The fishing charter was almost a disaster - we got to the fishing boat at 6:30 AM, and sat for one hour not moving as they tried to fix the boat. Left, came back to the hotel and another hour went past only to have us called back. We were offered NOTHING by the hotel (not even a free drink) for the inconvenience.    I would skip this island, especially on a first trip to Hawaii. Maybe if I got tired of Maui I'd come but three nights is way too long. We were dying to go back to Maui, and specifically Hotel Wailea. If you do come here, rent a 4x4 which was the highlight of our trip to drive the island and go to the cat sanctuary, or stay at hotel lanai city.",Aug 2019,August 2019,,,"Annapolis, Maryland"

697689347,50,Our best ever Four Seasons experience,"This is a truly world class resort. We had a four night stay at this property and every moment was perfect (except for my wife when I chased her with a small lizard). Every detail of this resort was perfect. We stopped in at the lounge at HNL and we were treated to refreshments while the staff assisted us with check in. When we arrived at the airport, the staff was waiting for us and quickly collected our bags and took us to the resort. From stepping onto the resort to stepping into our room it was approximately ten minutes.    The central welcome/pavilion area is stunning. Check it out on YouTube.    Our room was upgraded at no charge to a direct ocean view room. Room quality and furnishings are what you would expect from a hotel of this caliber.    The breakfast at this resort remains our favorite, ever. Make sure you try the buttermilk pancakes. Dinners were also special - the Nobu restaurant was worth its price (high praise!) and the steakhouse has special views of the ocean, especially at sunset.    If you visit this resort, make sure you do the hike up to sweetheart’s rock. If you’re coming from the mainland USA, you will probably be up very early so do this right at sunrise if you can. It’s a fantastic walk and you can burn some calories before a day of pina coladas at the pool. The excursions here were wonderful. We did the skeet shooting and archery trips. The staff was amazing and the cost for these events was basically nominal. We also enjoyed the golf course.

A lot of effort in maintaining the landscape. And most importantly, kindest people in the world working here.    The service was out of this world. Every single person we dealt with was so kind. They knew our names the whole trip. There must be something in the water there - SO KIND!    Beautiful property. Our room was amazing (even partial ocean view, GREAT!). Everything felt very lux from the service to the pool chairs (water kegs and snacks!).    Great food - pool food especially. Lots of diverse, dining options. Breakfast buffet spread A+. Didn't get sick of anything. The poke at OneForty was phenomenal. Shrimp skewers and vegan salad by the pool not to be missed. Pancakes at breakfast and the juices!    My husband golfed (sunset 9) and played tennis (clinics). It was good to have options to experience these things without having to do a full out 18 or private lesson. I got a massage - really high quality. Other than that we really enjoyed just laying by the pool, walking the beach, hiking up to Sweetheart Rock. I snorkeled for the first time and Jay on the beach took me out - really appreciated that because I was scared! There are so many boat trip, UTV etc other activity options but coming from an active Kauai trip we really wanted to veg a bit. Great views of the Bay from the pool area. Note: the beach here is great! Im not a beach person, but loved this one. And they do Hawaiian traditions at 5:30 on the back porch - conch/hula/ukelele shows. Don't miss it!!! Get a drink and enjoy the sunset (pink sky!) and the culture - it's Hawaii after all! I loved that.    We were close to going back to Big Island FS but happy we tried this one (even the two-leg flight, SO WORTH IT!). Really lovely property, great 4 days. I love this place!!! Definitely go.

The staff was fantastic, they couldn’t do enough to ensure our comfort.  The beach is a little walk, but that was perfectly fine for us; we liked the extra steps.  The food was okay, not spectacular...and as you would expect it was over priced.  We found the bed very comfortable and the room maintained temperature so we didn’t find ourselves burning up in the middle of the night because the AC turned off.

693951014,50,Really Nice,"It’s a bit verbose but here goes……..  We recently stayed for 8 nights in two rooms ; wife, son and myself in one room and my mom (81) in an ADA accessible room. Our first visit was in 2012 around the time Larry Ellison was purchasing the island.  The remodeled rooms are very, very nice although we found the lighting a bit lacking in the evening.  And no place to hang damp bathing towels in the bathroom – odd.  Top notch Dyson hair dryer, good quality bathroom amenities, thick towels replaced twice daily.  Japanese high-tech (my son calls car wash) toilets – incredible.  Four or five types of pillows for the bed – choose your favorite.  A Four Seasons logo parrot for our son’s FS zoo at home (that’s always a winner).  Staff generally very good, remarkable when you think about the modest population from which staff can be drawn.    We had multiple dinners at One-Forty, Nobu and the Sports Bar of generally excellent quality. Reservations can be made via the in-room tablet or the FS app.  No problem to make a custom kid’s mocktail for our son.  My mom had room dining and requested a custom BLT off-menu – no problem.  If you can explain what you want I believe they will try to accommodate you.    And believe the accounts of Larry Ellison on the island.  We saw him (with his discreet security detail) having dinners at One-Forty, Nobu and breakfast at One-Forty with friends. At that point my mom and wife were really impressed.    We wanted to take my mom into Lana’i City for a few hours.  I inquired about a car and driver and cost as she couldn’t handle the walk from the regular shuttle stop.  FS arranged to have an accessible shuttle drop and pick-up at a custom location (Richard’s Market).  They could have ‘sold’ us the car/driver for a couple of hundred dollars extra (and I would have paid) but they didn’t.  It’s perhaps a 300-meter walk down to Hulopo’e beach, too much for mom.  When she wanted to spend some time on the beach the bell staff got a vehicle and drove her down and then back a few hours later.  That is thoughtful service.    Wife and I took the early morning guided hike to sweetheart rock (photographer’s dream) and we tried the 6 am sunrise yoga – complimentary. Wife did the aerial yoga ($) and had a blast. There are daily complimentary activities as well as purchased activities – we did archery and skeet shooting with our son. All activities can be arranged at the resort.    As a baby-boomer I’m not a big app adopter but the FS app is handy.  I requested some extra bottles of water, extra coffee pods and a dental kit via the app while sitting down on the beach.  Several hours later upon return to our room they had been delivered – slick.  Drink straws are paper, take-away food containers are 100% compostable and water cups are reusable solid plastic indicating a fair degree of environmental awareness.    We’re not wealthy or celebrity so cost matters to us.  The entire package pencils out in terms of quality and service.  You’re not being asked to pay for extras every time you turn around.  We’ve stayed at FS Maui and FS Hualalai, both amazing in their respective ways.  Humble opinion, for pure relaxation + service + natural beauty this is the finest resort in Hawaii.

689937777,50,Set the standard during our first trip to Hawaii!,"Ah, what more can be said about the Four Seasons Lana'i! The property is beyond stunning and the views are to die for. We splurged on a Prime Oceanfront room for six nights and could not have been happier with our decision. Our jaws legitimately dropped when we were escorted to our room and saw our view. The bed is beyond comfortable and the bathroom is both functional and beautiful. I hated to leave our room, I loved it just that much.    Food at the resort is also top notch. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet via AMEX FHR and loved the daily pressed juices. We had daily lunch near the pools and were thrilled with all of the delicious, but healthy options. Dinner options included Nobu and One Forty. While both are fantastic, I will say that after being there for 6 days, I did wish for other, lighter options. The yellowtail at Nobu is everything people talk about and more.    We also enjoyed a couples massage (so good!) as well as the Sunset Sail. If you can do the sail, you definitely should. It offers beautiful views of Lanai, Molokai, Maui and, of course, the ocean! It's very romantic.    One slight criticism I will add - the ferry was canceled the day we were supposed to journey to the island from Maui. We were able to secure a room at the Westin, only to find out that the ferry was also canceled the next morning. FS secured a private plane for us and another couple that got us there in about 30 mintues (airport to airport). If you're staying at the FS, you can probably afford the flight, but I will note that for a couple, it runs about the price of a garden view room for the night.

689851140,50,Great resort away from the rest of Hawaii.,"The resort is around 30 minutes from Lanaii airport. Most parts of it are newly renovated and the rest is in good condition.    There is one breakfast place where there is a choice of buffet and a la carte with many different options so it does not get boring at all.    For lunch Malibu farm is a great option with plenty of organic and vegan options. For dinner there are two options, either a steak house or Nobu. Nobu was excellent but the menu is not as large as other Nobu's.    The beach is amazing as there is plenty of wildlife. I saw turtles and dolphins on multiple occasions. The pool is quite hectic and a little small for the size of the hotel so its better to go to the beach as it is much quieter.    Other than the resort the island is pretty boring with not much to do as it pretty barren but the isolation is amazing. The hotel rents cars so you can explore the island and you can easily spend an afternoon without seeing another person.",Jul 2019,April 2019,Traveled solo,,

689343490,50,Amazing Trip; Beautiful Resort! Terrific Tennis Experience as well!,"Stayed one week with my wife and three teenage daughters. This is a stunningly beautiful resort and exactly what we all needed - a more relaxing, less activity packed Hawaii vacation. The rooms are all luxurious, spacious, welcoming and comfortable. The beach was a highlight - not crowded at all, and lots of fun waves to jump into and body surf. the gym had plenty of state of the art equipment and I even got a Peleton session in. I also very much enjoyed the tennis. Ryan is a terrific pro who emailed me directly ahead of our stay and asked me questions about what i was hoping to work on - which really helped make for a fun, impactful few days of lessons while i was there. He astutely worked on my footwork and spacing and i was able to enjoy the weather and get a great workout in on the days I had lessons. We also had a snorkel sail trip that was amazing - our family plus one other were the only ones on a 80 foot motorized catamaran. the crew and views were amazing. we also went on a the off road tour of the island and I can honestly say I think they under marketed how amazing and fun this was. our woman driver was fantastic - she drove us at speeds of 70 mph through rugged terrain, in addition to being incredibly knowledgeable of the island's fauna and history. it was kind of like being on a super fun disney ride in the open, interlaced with island history. Last, the food was fantastic. We had the special Nobu Tepenyaki dinner and the chef and food were superb. the Malibu Farm Shop had tasty, healthy fare for the beach and pool. and the daily breakfast buffet was amazing. My only criticism are that the pools just dont match the high end nature of this resort and could be upgraded. Aside from that, we have no complaints. Overall this was a great getaway and we thoroughly enjoyed it!",Jul 2019,June 2019,Traveled with family,,"Tiburon, California"

688917187,40,Relaxing Oasis,"This is a beautiful island and property for those looking to escape the crowds and unplug. The low key and natural setting environment on Lanai is very peaceful. The Hulopoe beach that is next to the resort is rather small, and the sandy shoreline is nice for body surfing and swimming. The one downside is that it also has a public section that can get very crowded with locals and tourist that arrive from Maui for a day trip and snorkeling outing in the protected reef area. Surfing, it is very limited at Hulopoe, so if that is an interest you have to travel elsewhere on Lanai.    If you are booking a room at the resort, be sure that you understand the subtle (but important) differences in the various offerings: prime oceanfront; oceanfront, ocean view, and partial ocean  view. Leaves too much room for interpretation. Also, the rooms on the east side of the hotel have the shortest walk to the beach.    The dining options on Lanai are limited, outside of the Four Seasons. While the restaurants at the resort are good (especially Nobu), the meals are very expensive.

685285407,40,Best Resort in Hawaii,"Outstanding destination to spend a special occasion. I've stayed at several other properties on Maui (Ritz Carlton & Andaz) and on Kauai (Lodge at Kukui'ula), and this was truly a step above.    I'll skip over the pros (it appears that most of the reviews already document these) and highlight a few areas for improvement.    1. The arrival experience at the Lanai dock was not a good first impression. The attendant waited off to the side (not in clear view of guests getting off the boat), with no sign or name tag visible (it took me a bit of time to figure out that she was actually working for the Four Seasons and not a resident trying to get on the ferry). After she took our names down, she pointed to the van (on the other side of the ferry dock) and requested that we leave our luggage behind it (for the record I'm happy to take my own bags, just when I'm paying $1,000+ a night I expect a higher level of service). Bottle water was offered however, chilled towels were not (check-in experience did include chilled towels though).    2. Pool attendants were not very attentive. I mainly spent my time at the beach (those attendants were fantastic), but the times I went to the pool I was never greeted or approached and often needed to grab my own towels and find a chair. Used towels were also not removed/replaced after a guest had left, so I ended up putting a chair cover over an existing used one.    3. Spa facilities/amenities/staffing coverage was unacceptable (for a $250+ a treatment spa). Firstly, when I checked-in, there was no male locker room attendant working and thus I was not shown any of the amenities/features of the locker room. Consequently, the locker room was fairly dirty (used towels on the floor, common items not tidied up (hair dryer left on the sink counter), no robes in most of the available lockers). Amenities were non-existent (no shaving cream, cologne, moisturizer, etc, just your basic essentials). Finally, the facilities themselves were very underwhelming. No hot/cold tubs or a dedicated spa pool outside (each locker room does have a steam room and sauna (however the sauna was not turned on during my visit)). The treatment and therapist were excellent however.    4. No amenity gift for celebrating a special occasion. The staff did recognize it was my birthday, so that was excellent, but again a simple complimentary cocktail would have gone a long way.    Overall, absolutely loved my stay and would definitely be back. Just wanted to mention a few of the underwhelming aspects to the experience.",Jun 2019,June 2019,Traveled with family,,"Toronto, Canada"

682577047,50,Four seasons resort review,"Visited on explorer package which was previously known as love lanai package. First let me state the resort is unrivaled in beauty and service. Room amenities are spectacular and staff is top notch. Since I have been there with my wife many times including going back to when Koele lodge and the upcountry golf course existed we know many of the staff. Shout out to Josie at the view,Arnell at One-Forty, Flora at the desk andRyan at the golf course,we see them every time we go. Unfortunately the packages have been seriously diluted as golf is no longer included and the price is actually higher. The Discovery package is a $200 resort credit when you book a room but they raise the rate on the identical room $100 so the credit is only really $100. Very misleading and that has been acknowledged to me by staff. The golf for one staying at the hotel is $350 and $100 for a replay. Best golf experience you will ever have. On most days 20 players max and the conditions are impeccable. Quite candidly our favorite resort in the world and becoming more well known worldwide. Despite the recent erosion in the package benefits they reflect a luxury destination for the discriminating traveler and value is not a part of the proposition.

From the minute we arrived on the ferry, the woman from the hotel that greeted us was very warm and friendly. When we pulled up, the property was breathtaking, impeccably kept, and everybody that worked there from the Gardner to the servers at the restaurants were the friendliest people I have ever met.

The pool staff was very friendly and helpful.    Prior to staying at Four Seasons, I downloaded the app. It never reflected our spa appointment, and the app was generally pointless.    Customer service is outstanding and incomparable. Very nice room, only two complaints, small refrigerator and outside...untidy lanai, sprinkler lines totally uncovered and ugly to look at.    I would also have liked to find an easily accessible trail to follow along the coastal cliffs.    Overall, excellent, peaceful, beautiful and definitely a spot to go to again.",Apr 2019,April 2019,Traveled as a couple,,"Maui, Hawaii"

Our stay exceeded our expectations on nearly every level - the rooms, the service, the recreational activities, the food. We paired our 4 night stay with a 3 night trip to maui as we were concerned we would run out of things to do on Lana’i, but we were mistaken! There are so many fun activities offered through the resort, and we only got to sample a few, all of which were top notch (the snorkel sail, the ATV tours, the clay pigeon shooting, aerial yoga). And the beach and pool area were wonderful. The kids program was a hit with my 9 and 5 year old, and it was so nice that they could just drop in without any additional charge. We loved eating at Nobu, and also enjoyed the delicious food and drinks served at the pool from Malibu Farm. Our only regret is that we didn’t stay longer!

The restaurants are superb, especially Nobu which offers perfectly prepared, very fresh seafood. I would especially commend the hotel for its commitment to local culture, with educational sessions for guests. The activity menu is great - beyond a stunning golf course, the Four Seasons offers opportunities to get out on the ocean, drive around the island and horseback ride. Best of all, the service is top notch and personal. Truly a special property!",Apr 2019,March 2019,Traveled as a couple,,"Old Lyme, Connecticut"

Or be dead on the beach if that's what you like! (after sun provided in room as part of standard amenities) Super comfortable bedrooms that are an oasis of tranquility to go back to in the evening. Excellent breakfast, with both buffet and a la carte options so plenty of choice to fulfil pretty much any craving, and 2 restaurants for dinner, incl. probably the only Nobu with same day reservations! And One Forty isn't bad either! (the wagyu New York strip is recommended; it's the size of a brick, but soft like butter). But the real stars are the super friendly and helpful staff across the resort. They're making the effort to try and remember your name, and generally aiming to fulfil any request, which is really nice. Oh, and no hidden resort fees.

There is ""The Retreat"", a pool and waterfall that is restricted to those 21 and older that is quieter and surrounded with banks of flowers. The staff are all welcoming and accommodating, the views are great, and the rooms are spacious and well appointed.

Also should ask is it effort for members of the team to put in effort or is it effort?  One more thing an upgrade if available at arrival if not available but you can buy another upgrade is awful. Just don’t bother with mentioning potential.  Best bits: Nobu. Fantastic restaurant. All activities and the Activity team are brilliant. Horse riding, jeeps, sailing all the very highest calibre.

What they have here is a marvellous private setting on a beatiful bay on a remote Hawaiian island. Don’t expect a consumer culture or the ability to shop for bling as there is little shopping on the island. What the island does offer is serenity, and a wonderful well-protected environment, including great hiking, swimming, and tide pools, all with little or no people. This is not Waikiki beach or Lahaina. If you expect to be able to walk out to a Jack in a Box or a bar, forget it.

661751809,50,Loved FS Lana'i,"We really enjoyed our 2 night stay in Lana'i. As our flight was cancelled from Sydney making us miss one of the original 3 nights, they graciously agreed to not charge us for the lost night. Thank you!  We had a fantastic ala carte dinner at Nobu on our first night, and were very happy with all of the 7+ dishes as well as the service in a very casual atmosphere. As our luggage didn't arrive with us, we spent the afternoon in the sports bar enjoying the unusual cocktails and the fabulous service when the female server (don't remember her name) brought us tastes of the ingredients which went into a cocktail so we could decide exactly what it was that we liked - exceptional service! The included breakfast offered many options and I especially liked the sashimi offerings.  We had booked the room with the activity package included and tried the UTV four wheel drive experience with Shane who was very conversational about the island and its offerings. We also did the sunset tour and snorkeling tour the next morning. Both were really fun (cocktails and food are included) and we saw the tips of whales and a large school of dolphins which seemed to want to race the boat and stayed with us for quite a while. The staff are professional and helpful. The gym is well equipped. We took advantage of the shuttle service to/from Lana'i city.  However, I did not appreciate getting a hard sell from Allan upon check-in and also in the room to upgrade to an ocean view room for a nominal fee. It made us feel that we weren't given a great room to start and I question whether the hard sell was really necessary? Also, when requesting a late check-out from Allan and being rejected, I had to remind him that I was only asking for a one hour reprieve and that the hotel was no where near full before he granted the late check-out. I know that late checkout isn't guaranteed but it sure made our life easier as we were returning from the 12pm snorkeling trip and wanted to shower/pack up before we took the ferry on to Lahaina, Maui.

660840638,40,Excellent property/Staff lacking usual Four Seasons service,"I am a Four Seasons client and what makes it so special to me, is the attention to detail and service they give. This property is beautiful, received a wonderful upgrade with ocean view and absolutely loved the room. The restaurants are very good and since it is a small island (1 town), we ate a hotel (and golf club) during our stay. But, our trouble began the moment we arrived and staff member said they would 1. change husbands golf date 2. ask for late check out. Neither was done. Secondly had several emails regarding complimentary class, after several communications back/forth with time, asking for reservation, I asked just to cancel until after I arrived. Welcome letter included class with time so we decided to go UNTIL we found out it was NOT the complimentary one. I even asked desk clerk before we went to double check and make sure it was complimentary (she said yes). We were not charged. Then came time for my spa, which i did have confirmed as facial, and other treatments. I arrive and they had booked a massage (not facial), facials were all booked for following day (so i took the massage). The massage was excellent along with other treatments (highly recommend spa) and they did give me a discount, and I was thankful...but at this point with so many blunders by staff, it truly left us with a bad taste for the whole experience, meant to be relaxing. My husband loved the golf (his birthday) and was glad that went well.

660816773,50,A special spot!,"We visited Lania for our honeymoon and were blown away by the property and the service at the Four Seasons. I wanted to write a note because the people we met who worked at our hotel made our stay extra special. I can honestly say the staff seemed genuinely happy to help and happy to be there- which made our experience even more memorable.    A few people that stood out to us- Markum at the Nobu bar- served us some amazing sushi, had great knowledge of the food and drink menu, the island, and always made us feel welcome to sit and chat with him.    One the snorkel sail- Martin was a character who has a passion for the island and enthusiastically offered up interesting tidbits about what we were seeing. He was also very proactive about making sure we got several pictures with the sunset!    Shane on the UTV tour was also great. He gave us a real understanding of the island and spoke highly of the relationships between the Four Seasons and residents of Lanai.    Something else I want to note- the rescue birds were another highlight of our trip. We would walk by them several times a day to and from our room- they say Aloha and Hello and we thought it was great you were offering a home to these magnificent birds.    Finally- one of the most memorable parts of our trip was spending time in the Tennis Garden with pro Ryan Winters. We are avid tennis players and felt it was a huge asset to have someone like Ryan at the resort. We were just going to play one day with him and then ended up hitting with him for three days in a row. I'm still thinking of his insightful tips while I'm playing here at home. Ryan is a professional and a gentleman! His passion for tennis is infectious and we were genuinely sad to leave the island- after feeling like we had made a friend on Lanai. If we return to the resort, it will be because we want to hit with Ryan again! Please pass on our heartfelt thanks to him.    A wonderful stay- with great people.

660655780,50,Oceanfront Luxury,"We started our trip by chartering Lanai Air for a small private plane from Honolulu to Lanai. They put a red carpet out for me and my husband when we boarded and deplaned and it was fun to be so pampered. The hotel helped us maintain this illusion because from the time they pick you up at the airport the staff makes everyone feel as through they are visiting celebrities.  We stayed in an oceanfront suite and had an amazing south view of the small bay and ocean. Since it was February we were treated to a regular humpback whale show everyday. Gorgeous. The gardens were lush and well maintained and a lagoon with fat healthy koi ran through the center of the resort  The room was spacious and impeccably appointed with large TV in front of the bed, a Toto toilet and even a mirror in the bathroom mirror.  We went diving two days on our trip - hoping to encounter a pod of dolphins or a humpback (one can dream) but we had some beautiful dives anyway.

659844073,50,Relaxing Tropical Oasis in Lanai,"Our stay at the Four Seasons Lanai was above and beyond what we expected. This property is breathtaking from the moment you enter the lobby and see the beautiful ocean vistas. The recent renovation was well done. The property is designed and landscaped in a way that most of the time you feel like one of only a handful of guests - it never feels crowded. The entire island is so peaceful and free of tourist-inspired overdevelopment. The rooms are nicely appointed with a mix of modern and traditional Hawaiian style furniture and accents, a huge TV, and a private patio with two chairs, a table, and one lounge chair. The bed was extremely comfortable, and the bathroom was spacious and full of amenities including a heated toilet, Dyson hair dryer, and TV in the mirror. Housekeeping was prompt and friendly every day. The pool and beach areas are tranquil and enjoyable, with excellent service provided by the staff. The dining options on property are all great, though very pricey. There are five places to eat, but only three open for dinner. We loved the incredible buffet breakfast at 140, but preferred dinner either at Nobu, the sports bar, or in town at a small local restaurant. The activities the resort offers are plentiful, fun, and reasonably priced. We highly recommend archery and clay shooting, sunset sail, and the Jeep rental. Overall, the service at this property is what you would expect at a 5 star resort - the staff learns your name and treats you like a valuable guest. A few tips to make your trip amazing: book the transfer on Lanai Air for a luxurious and easy trip to the island of Lanai from Honolulu, splurge for the breakfast buffet, try the vegan chop salad or the papaya burrata salad at Malibu Farm, get a room on the first floor for more outdoor space, get up for the sunrise yoga at least once to see the stunning view, check out the tide pools and sweetheart rock, and save on food costs by going into town for a few dinners!

(noon) We're aware that this is not always possible and in this case we were fine as we had rented a jeep to tour the island. We dined at the restaurant ""View"" came down around 1:30 still no room and our suitcases were still outside on the sidewalk. Fine, more touring around. We were told we'd get a text message when the room was ready. At 4:30pm we returned to see our luggage still sitting on the sidewalk! Our room was ready, but no one bothered to move our luggage or notify us. Not a great start. My husband was so mad he carried our luggage down ourselves.  That being said, our room was amazing. It is slightly dark, but we found it very comfortable. The 75"" TV did not look large in the room. Dyson hair dryers in the bathroom and I never thought I would fall in love with a toilet! The landscaping is lush and well maintained. The staff work very hard on it and you can tell. The walk to your room can be quite the journey. I knew if my parents had been with us, they'd be lost most of the time. The signage could be better as you don't even notice it until broad daylight.  Over the course of our stay you could tell they were short staffed in some places. Finding good help is a problem everywhere and on a small island I'm sure it's more difficult.

This is a place that you come to relax even though there is golf and some other recreational offerings The spa is very nice and the massage I received was excellent.

658602194,50,"unspoiled, secluded, beautifully appointed throughout","Room was in Bldg 4, top floor. So quiet with an ocean view. Long walk from lobby, but each time we noticed different art or talked to exotic birds along the way. Staff routinely goes above and beyond. One in particular is Paola Tavella in food/beverage, even though she is more akin to a hotel ceo/ambassador in the way she handles guests ensuring their comfort.    Snorkeling is as good as anywhere. Water a beautiful blue, and warm. Dolphins were resting and playing in the bay during our stay. There are many activities, but we only partook in the sunset cruise one evening, enjoyed yoga (Will and Raj) either on the beach or up high in the Pavillion overlooking the Pacific, and golf with stunning views and a practice facility available to resort guests even when not playing.    Food was amazing, and it was the most simple dishes we enjoyed most. For instance an arugula salad with papaya, burrato cheese and macadamia nuts with olive oil and sea salt. The aforementioned Paolo served a great burger from the sports bar sitting by a firepit one evening that was out of this world.    We loved this place and will return. If money is a concern, just save and go regardless. It is pricey but worth it....and understandable as this is remote. Only 3000 or so inhabitants, so few that babies are born in Maui or Honolulu and not Lanai.

658235499,50,Fantastic; top notch.,"Firstly, we are well traveled, and have enjoyed high end results in several countries. Montage was a big let down on Maui, as was the 4 seasons on Oahu. However, this 4 seasons is a solid step or two above. Everything was excellent. Simply everything. Highlights:  1. Food - great selections, great service, great food. We are picky, and when a nice resort has average food, it is such a let down. Was not the case here, with Nobu being the favorite.  2. Tennis - Was a blast. Great personality from coach Ryan from PBI. He was fantastic to hit with, and we used his services daily. He truly helped my wife with a few issues... (no not the psychiatric ones...)  3. Service/Rooms - The hotel itself is damn perfect. They were so accommodating and kind. We have a 3 year old and 6 month old, and they were just so sweet to our kids and everyone just loved everything.  Simply put, very high end, but actually worth every penny. We will be back, PERIOD.  If i had to find a complaint, it would be:  They offered an upgrade for a 2k more a night, which we took. However, the room ended up having I would say a partial to almost full ocean view... they should have warned us is all... we prefer a wide sweeping view of the ocean :).

657888643,30,Got our trip off to the wrong start,"This property is amazing, the location is spectacular and the staff was so friendly. However, we had the misfortune of sharing our first two nights out of five with a large corporate group of about 200 people. They took over the entire property, monopolized the pools and facilities and were disrespectful to the other guests as well as the staff with loud and obnoxious behavior. They also brought a ton of kids with them, which I am tolerant of and expect, but this was way beyond what I thought was reasonable for this type of resort.    We walked into this Four Seasons thinking that we were going to one of the best resorts in Hawaii if not the world. After those first two nights we felt like we might as well have been in Cancun because that was the atmosphere. Thankfully, they left on our third day and we were able to enjoy the resort as the experience we were promised and expecting. We were trying hard to not let it affect our trip but it really started our vacation off on a bad note and took a couple of days to shake.    Of course I understand that the hotel can't control the behavior of its other guests and rely on these types of events as part of their bottom line. However, they could have been more transparent with us in terms of what we were walking into as I would have scheduled the trip differently. I know that there is a limit to what they can disclose, but I was in close contact with them throughout the planning process and they had every opportunity to suggest an alternative itinerary, recommend an offsite excursion on those days or even apologize for what they knew to be a less than ideal experience for us after the fact. At this price point, I expected much better.",Mar 2019,February 2019,Traveled as a couple,,

656604792,50,Simply Wonderful!,We actually were staying on Maui for the week in Wailea but prior to the trip I wanted to take the ferry over to Lanai and stay over at the Four Seasons. The pictures I had seen online were so beautiful that I just knew I wanted the opportunity to stay over even if it was just for one night. We booked through the AMEX fine hotels and resorts program so that gives you a little bit more time with early and late check-in. They picked us up at the ferry right on time and it was just a quick short ride over to the hotel. The hotel lobby was amazing. We were offered leis and a welcome drink. We checked in and were escorted to our beautiful prime oceanfront view room. The view was out of this world and the room was finished like it wasn’t a hotel. The walk to your room was like walking through a beautifully landscaped garden. Four Seasons Lanai is easily The most beautiful hotel I’ve stayed at in a long time. The bathroom was simply gorgeous with a TV in the mirror. The pool area was small but had beautiful views and grounds. The beach was just a short walk down the hill to the left to the hotel. There were tide pools there and some snorkeling but because of an impending storm the ocean was a little rough. We had guacamole and drinks out at the pool after the beach and that was really nice. We dined at Nobu for dinner. It would have been perfect there if it had not rained that evening and into the next morning as Nobu has open air seating. We love that we could open the doors to our room and listen to the ocean and the rain and it was the best sleep I have had in a long time. The bed was so comfortable. The rain shower in the bath was perfect. We had the breakfast buffet in the morning and it was simply delicious.

This is our 6th visit here. 5 of the 6, we’ve stayed at this property (hasn’t always been a Four Seasons). First - they upgraded our Partial Ocean View room to a Suite. What a fantastic upgrade! The Suites are fantastic with large balconies and 2 full bathrooms. Second - The service was outstanding. The employee-to-guest ratio must be very high. Third - My wife suffered a severe foot injury on a hike. We were provided a wheelchair, crutches and overall wonderful pampering by all of the staff.  Fourth - Because of a freak storm, our ferry back to Maui was canceled for the day. The hotel not only kept us in the same room, but gave us a discounted rate.  Rarely does a hotel exceed my expectations, but the Four Seasons did.  Also, by the way, this hotel sits on maybe the best snorkeling beach in all of Hawai’i.  So, beautiful location, great service, gorgeous rooms - any downside?  Cost - this property comes with a very large price tag. Golf is very expensive, as well as food.

651933317,50,BEST luxury resort in Hawaii,"We chartered the four seasons plane from their Hualalai location. Super quick flight. We were immediately met by a rep from the hotel who drove us down the pine lined street to the hotel. We were met with great warmth, water, warm towels, etc. Our only hiccup was an aggressive and off putting upsell upon check in, but once we mentioned this to the manager, she did a great job of making it right.    Rooms - Some of the most well decorated rooms I've ever seen. No expense was spared. LOVED the motion sensored, heated, electronic bidet. And the journey to the rooms can be quite charming as well with little cut through gardens and ponds, sitting nooks, etc.    Lobby - So warm and love that you can see straight to the ocean once you enter the hotel.    Grounds - During the holiday season was almost overstaffed which I have absolutely no issue with and is almost unheard of. The place was immaculate, not a leaf or stick out of place! Workers were throwing new flower petals by the sundbeds every morning. I loved the feeling of privacy they have created with various nooks and lush greenery. Not your typical large pool with everyone opening observing each other from across the way. The beach is a 5 min walk down bc all beaches are public here. They offer food service but no alcohol.    Food - Fresh and delicious. Great having 3 dining options. Some of the best service I've ever received anywhere, kudos. These servers are well trained, keeping close by to let you know they are there for anything without hovering. We did the private hibachi grill experience at Nobu and WOW. I've never experience meat melt in my mouth before. Breakfast buffet was plentiful. I also loved the snacks they would serve by the pool and beach throughout the day, fresh and delicious.    Activities - We saw dolphins on the sunset t our. The UTV tour was exhilarating. Loved that they had cultural activities. They even had miniature horses out front. Also quite enjoyed the aerial silks class they offered.    Golf Course - The MOST BEAUTIFUL we've ever seen! We quite enjoyed the 9 hole sunset experience. We had a cocktail and played the holes nearest the cliffs. BEST place to watch the sunset here. Breathtaking.    All in all this is a special place. I loved the small island feeling. This was the only resort we went to that felt the most authentic and lush and lived up to my mental image of Hawaii. Considering the premium we were paying to visit during Christmas, I felt we got the most beauty, service, and relaxation from this hotel vs the other 3 we visited throughout our trip.",Feb 2019,December 2018,Traveled as a couple,,"New York City, New York"

647977432,40,Could have been a five,"Stayed here for a four night stay for wife’s birthday.    Used the lounge at honolulu airport and this was very quiet and comfortable. You can rest up a bit and have wine, beer, champagne or soft drinks while you wait to head iff to Lanai. They also check you in to the hotel so you do not have to do it when you arrive at the hotel. They give you a rubber wrist band for a key so no need to carry anything else while at the hotel. Once you arrive at the hotel you get escorted right to your room while others have to stand in line at the reception desk to check in.    Room - we had a garden view room on the top floor. I emailed earlier to request this as the floor is hardwood so you may hear you upstairs neighbours stomping around if they are noisy. Room is very nicely updated with a very large washroom. The shower floor are covered in black stones and this looks nice until you have to stand on the surface. Painful to the feet and you want to get out as fast as you can. The water pressure is also very low.    Housekeeping is where they lost points. They ask you when you check in when you would like downturn and clean up. The downturn is not much of one except for putting water bottles by the bed and cleaning up the washroom. No small gift at downturn either. The third night they missed completely and we had to call at 9:30 to have them come and give us more new towels and conditioner. This was after we had finished the Dinner under the Stars. They were all friendly and apologetic about it but not very efficient during our stay.    Activities- there is ample for one to do at this resort. My wife had a massage the first day and was thoroughly relaxed afterwards. We did a private snorkel tour on the Lanai V boat for three hours. The boat is basically yours to do as you wish. We snorkelled a bit but decided to try fishing. We caught about 8 large yellow fin tunas. Chris and Ricky were amazing at taking care of us. Dinner under the stars was very nice though it did take a while to get in contact to plan out the menu as this was a surprise for the wife. The meal was the best of our entire holiday and all seafood. Did the deep sea fishing excursion and we were the only two on the boat so was like a private tour again. Chris and Dustin were excellent at teaching us to fish and we caught a 140 lb marlin on our way back to the resort. We also did the one hour skeet shooting and pistol sessions. Basically just the two of us and our instructor - Denis, who was an excellent and patient teacher. They also have archery but we did not have enough time to do that. There is also cultural activities where you can learn to play a ukulele or make traditional paper. The desk for the experiences is very helpful in booking any activity you want.    Dining - Dinner under the Stars is a nice romantic event. The food is a five course menu tailored to your tastes and paired with wine accordingly. You can relax after in a huge cabana if you wish. The sports bar is a good place for casual bites though am shocked they do not have a mahi mahi burger. Wife had to go to Lanai city and have one at Blue Ginger. Small and not much decor but the mahi mahi burger was the best of the entire 10 days in the islands. If you catch a fish the chef can cook it up for you. I would say skip this part. We did this and ate at 140 but the meal we had consisted of an appetizer of grilled tuna and a small amount of rice. The tuna amounted to about five small mouthfuls. The main entree was exactly the same but just more tuna and rice. Granted they did add a bit of rapini. When we caught the fish they had us fill in a form and you could check off your way fo cooking and side dishes. This was a bit confusing and resulted in a very boring fish meal. The menu at 140 was much more interesting and we wish we could have had that instead of the caught fish.    Staff. Is the star of the resort. Everyone is friendly and helpful. This is what make the resort so wonderful.    Also had a noise issue twice early in the morning. Engineering was in the crawl space above our room and you could hear really loud walking noise. This occurred at 6:30 in the morning. Advised management and they apologized and made things right.    I would not hesitate recommending this resort to people as there is ample to do is one so wishes. The people are very friendly. Only caveat us that the work on the housekeeping and once they fix those issues then it will be a 5/5.",Jan 2019,January 2019,Traveled as a couple,,"Toronto, Canada"
647415971,50,Unexpectedly fabulous,"Always curious about Lanai, my husband and I finally got the chance to experience this beautiful resort! We had no idea of what to expect, except we were told that it was amazing by some people, and others said ""why go there? There is nothing to do!"" We flew Lanai Air from the big island- so easy! It's about a 30 minute flight. We were picked up in a beautiful Tesla and driven about 20 minutes to the hotel. The road is lined with pine trees that look like the logo for the Four Seasons, but we were told they had been there long before the hotel, they apparently absorb water into the needles and eventually the water goes through the root system and into the water table. A very important thing for a small island with very little water. Upon arriving at the hotel, we were greeted with the traditional lei and a pinapple cocktail. The view from the lower lobby out to the ocean is spectacular. The hotel is beautifully decorated having been renovate a few years ago. We were told it is High tech! They have several pads on the wall in the rooms that control the lighting- giving you several choices of lighting scenes, and control of the shades- a sheer one and a black out shade. There is a ""launch"" pad next to the bed that lets you control nearly everything you would want at the resort. From Activities to dining reservations and more. The first night I used it to order room service. The next day however it did not work when I wanted to use it to make spa reservations. I called the ""ambassador"" and they were very apologetic and sent someone to take care of it right away. The toilet is really something. It greets you when you walk into the bathroom by raising the lid. It has many options for cleaning your bum and even has a drier. I asked the ambassador i.e. concierge to make dining reserations for us. She suggested Nobu for one night, and then the special chef dinner on the Teppan grill at Nobu for another night. And finally One Fourty grill for the last night. It was ALL great! We met the manager of Nobu upon arrival at the restaurant and he was awesome! His name is Trevor and he couldn't have been nicer or more accommodating. He helped us with our selections, and everything was delicious, we especially loved the spinach salad. The next night for the chef tasting dinner he greeted us again and helped to make it another very special night. We experienced the freshest ingredients done simply, and perfectly. We love walking and hiking during the day, so we did alot of that! We walked the Fishermans trail daily after breakfast, and then along the streets- all with spectacular views of the Ocean. There are two pools, very small and with a pond like feel. It has been designed to give lots of places to have privacy. There is an over 21 pool and one for families. We had our chairs set up with views of the ocean. The staff is very friendly and we enjoyed getting to know them a little. The property takes a day or two to learn to navigate. I got lost a couple of times, but the staff would happily lead me to where I needed to go. Although the island it's self is very arid, the Four Seasons property is as lush as any Jungle you can imagine. It's breathtaking! There was a waterfall just outside out room, with a area with two lounge chairs. I could imagine if you were on your honeymoon, this would be the perfect place to have a drink and a romantic moment. Our experience with the spa couldn't have been better, the massage and facial were perfect. The spa is beautiful- small, but really well done. Sadly the one activity we really wanted to do was unavailable to us due to a road closure. That was renting a Jeep and going to see the garden of the Gods and the beautiful beach nearby. We were told due to rains there the road was too muddy and the possibility of getting stuck made it too risky. That's ok though, now we have a reason to go back! If I had realized how fabulous this place is I would have booked 6 nights instead of the 4. Also, on a final note, we flew the small charter plane to Honolulu for our return flight home. There is a special lounge at the airport exclusively for Four Seasons Lanai guests. They gave us snacks and drinks, and we were able to charge our phone and computer.",Jan 2019,January 2019,Traveled as a couple,,"Park City, Utah"

645855243,50,Addicted to the Four Seasons Lanai,"A little update to my previous review! My husband and I traveled to from NYC to Hawaii about 8 months ago for our Honeymoon. We had booked our itinerary with no intention of stopping in Lanai. To be honest, I had never really heard much about the island living on East Coast (Maui seems to steal the show) until I stumbled upon the Four Seasons Lanai here on TripAdvisor. After reading lots of reviews I started doing some Googling about the island’s history and evolution of the resort. The untouched, quiet nature of the island seemed so special. I was compelled enough to change our plans and book with the four seasons Lanai for the first part of our Honeymoon. From our arrival to departure the whole time was just magical. Service, food, the room etc. I even caught strep throat from family after the wedding and somehow managed to truck through this at Lanai like a trooper. The staff made sure I was able to get an appointment at the clinic quickly and even drove us to town. I haven’t forgotten that kind level of service. Since this visit we’ve stayed at multiple four seasons and while all lovely we keep just comparing our stay to the FS Lanai. My husband and I dream about those breakfast burritos at the buffet. I don’t even really like burritos. If you’re looking for a deal or a cheap trip this is not that, but if you’re looking for an experience then this might be your place. When we left, I vowed we’d somehow find an excuse to make it back soon. We’ve booked later this year and I couldn’t be more thrilled to be going back.",Jan 2019,May 2018,Traveled as a couple,,

The breathtaking view on the ocean, and the gardens (this type of suite is in the corner with a nice terrace, which is great to have a panoramic view), the quality of the room (very clean), the resort, the personnel and the service is outstanding. I have tried each restaurant, and we were not disappointed. I really enjoyed the ""Dining under stars"" concept - you have the chef preparing a menu with wine pairing only for you, and the dining table is set in front of the ocean. The beach and service on the beach is perfect.  Also, the (long) list of activities offered by the Concierge. We tried quite a few, and the helicopter tour, the sunset sail and the jeep tour of the island, were our preferred ones.

643447542,40,The Billionaire's Island Resort,"Sometimes things don't turn out the way you thought they would. What was meant to be the highlight of our Hawaii trip was only good in the end. Our most expensive stop, the place where Bill Gates got married, is beautiful and worth a visit. But we didn't lose our hearts there. Certainly also because we had some bad luck and hurricane danger restricted the services in the hotel. By the way, our real highlight would be the cheapest accommodation of our trip, the Puakea Ranch on Big Island.    Pro  _ Beautiful arrival by ferry from Maui and only a few minutes by car to the resort  _ Great facility with lots of green and open paths to the rooms  _ Beautiful beach with sunbeds and umbrellas and service  _ Lonely location, there are no other resorts on Lanaii  _ Jeeps for rent for excursions  _ Free shuttle to the village of Lanaii  _ Nobu Restaurant  _ Very nice tennis courts  _ Each room with balcony or terrace and beautiful view  _ Very competent and friendly staff, calming and helpful even under stress due to approaching hurricane  _ All managers, including general managers, introduce themselves personally and regularly inquire about one' s well-being.  _ Perfect service via Messenger in FS App    Con  _ Lagoon-style pools very small  _ About 10 minutes walk to the beach  _ Temporary jellyfish in the sea  _ Breakfast includes only filter coffee and no other coffee, which is absurd at the general prices  _ No price concessions despite three days of massively limited hotel services during hurricanes danger    Conclusion  Nice and good for a short trip, but beware: don't overestimate your expectations, which also result from the hotel prices.

642117767,10,So very disappointing,"My family loves traveling the world. When exploring new places we appreciate the comforts of home in the evenings, and we therefore tend to stay loyal to our favorite property chains.    We decided today to take a last minute NYE getaway. Because we are so last minute, I pulled up the Four Seasons’ website to see which properties showed availability before booking flights.    Hawaii is an easy go-to for last minute travel for us (no visas needed, etc.) and I was excited to see that Four Seasons Lanai showed availability. I wanted to book a special offer so I called the property to confirm my reservation.    Susan confirmed my reservation, and proceeded to follow up per the below:    - Called to tell me that my reservation had been cancelled (even though a reservation number had been issued)    - Followed up via email to advise that there was a glitch in there system, and my reservation was reinstated    - Reinstated my reservation for the incorrect dates    - Upon emailing and calling her, I was told that the rate they quoted me was not valid (price is now $600 more a night for same room category). And they could not honor the Love Lanai package.    - I said I would pay the $2100 per night requested for the room, and she proceeded to tell me that I’d have to move rooms mid-stay. My other options were to downgrade my room category and pay just $400 more than my original reservation price per night (no ocean view), pay $1300 more than my original reservation rate for an upgrade, or she could refund my deposit and I could just stay home.    - Susan apologized over and over, acknowledged the error was on her side, and yet instead of honoring what was quoted to me, or putting someone on the phone who was empowered to fix this situation, offered up a $100 hotel voucher?!?    My husband has been telling me just pay the difference, but for me, this is a matter of principle, not money. I run a global marketing and customer success organization, and fully understand that mistakes will inevitably happen, but I am honestly dumbfounded that such a strong luxury brand cannot problem solve better than this.    For a family that goes out of our way to stay with Four Seasons around the world, this level of service makes me question our loyalty.    Now the process of cancelling flights (that I waited to book until I had a hotel reservation), and explaining to my son why our Hawaiian adventure is cancelled when they wake in the morning...

Our wedding group was feeling fortunate to be going and we enjoyed our lively crossing. We were met at the Lanai dock by the Four Seasons shuttle and were at the resort within 5 minutes! We were quickly checked in and were guided to our rooms by their friendly knowledgeable staff! Wow and what a room! The resort is beautiful having undergone renovations two years ago and far exceeded our expectations! Each and every member of the staff were very friendly and helpful and what came across was their sincerity in doing so! The wedding event went without a hitch and the dinner that night was superb at the outdoor restaurant with exceptional service. The next day some of our group went golfing and later raved about the view, the groom who has golfed all over North America said it was his favorite course! Their was a wind advisory for later that day so the Resort staff gathered us all up to ensure we would make the earlier than expected ferry sailing. The ferry ride back made a few of the group sick though but seasickness bags were plentiful!

639208377,50,"Best Fourseasons Resort, by far!","Lanai is amazing. Unbelievable Reno including new adults only pool done in black lava rock, a good hike to the beach (and public, so no alcohol) but Fourseaons will set you up with chairs and umbrellas. Rooms are fantastic except for two things: floor in shower is rocks which I am sure some designer said “will massage your feet as you shower” but, if just feels like you are standing on rocks and second, be careful of your room since ours were on an “L” and remember, if I can see you changing, you can see me changing. Such high end rooms though, spectacular wood, drapes that are electronic, bidet toilet and best of all, a Dyson hairdryer. Just remember, the beach bag is free for use when there but if you “forget” it isn’t yours it is $190 bucks.  There are wonderful little private areas on property with chaise lounges, koi fish and parrots. Golf course has lone the most spectacular views and well kept courses we have ever played. And, let’s not forget, there is a NOBU on property!!! This is one of the best (out of 23 I have stayed) Fourseaons, ever. Good deal on the Love Lanai package which included golf. There is a big pod of dolphins that hang around in the bay.  Tip: take the ferry over and back only in the am if you are subject to sea sickness since the waves and wind always pick up in the afternoon  It is a bit of a pain to schlep your luggage on the ferry with everyone else and their Costco groceries (hey, FS, how about a private ferry like Nevis) but worth it once you get there.",Dec 2018,December 2018,Traveled as a couple,,"Toronto, Canada"
639184659,20,Beautiful Property - Ruined by food allergies and poor service recovery,"Well, let's start with the good:    FS Lanai is a beautiful property. The grounds are stunning and well-maintained. The rooms are well-done and very high-end. Pool and beach service is plentiful. The snorkel sail was fantastic and highly recommended. Breakfast buffet was delicious and the food very fresh. Malibu Farms pool-side F&B options hit the spot.    The OK:    General service is rather lackluster. It is not up to Four Seasons standards. This goes for every department. While staff might have more agency than say a Marriott, the actual service quality was not 5*. Nobu is an over-rated chain with just ok food. Giant TVs with sports wrecks the tropical relaxation mood.    Now the bad:    My fiancée is allergic to nuts, it is in our FS profile notes, and we have always been careful. In fact, she has only had 2 instances where she has come into contact with nuts, this Four Seasons being the second. Without going into details (which mirrors an April review here on TripAdvisor in many ways), negligent sports bar staff wrecked our stay by misleading my fiancée into eating peanuts. While she ultimately survived, vomiting and being terrified of having an anaphylactic reaction was hardly the night we had imagined. This was only compounded by the lack of management taking this seriously and zero proactive follow-up for any type of service recovery. Ultimately, after much pressure from myself and our wonderful TA (and being promised a call from the GM, which never materialized) was a meaningful gesture extended. A 5* property should know when it screws up and make things right without the guest having to hold them responsible. We are not demanding guests and have NEVER had to complain before.    Ironically, we were only at the sports bar because Nobu bar staff randomly insisted my 25 year old fiancée need to show ID, despite being resort guests, having no wallets on us, and not having had issues at any other luxury resort ever before. While there is indeed a legal requirement to ensure no one under the age is served, it is a joke to expect resort guests to carry their wallets with them for random spot checks.        So, in sum, it’s a beautiful property with ok food options, bad F&B service (maybe not complete coincidence Director of F&B job is open?), and lackluster management. While management’s recovery ultimately made me not completely turned off by Four Seasons as a whole, I would have trouble recommending this property at its current service standards.",Dec 2018,December 2018,Traveled as a couple,,

638456430,50,Serenity awaits you in Lanai,"We took our annual family trip to Hawaii this year and began at the FS Lanai. It was our first trip to the island and left a remarkable desire to return. Although Lanai is quieter than the other islands, you pretty much know what you’re signing up for in comparison to the other Hawaiian isles and the tranquility was overtly refreshing.    My mom could not have more compliments to dish out regarding the golf course, and I concur. The views were incredible and the course was maintained beyond all comparison. Be sure to stop for lunch whether you golf or not at the Viewhouse.    The spa was fantastic and one of the best massages ever. The staff was very hospitable and attentive from the moment we arrived. The ladies (Nancy and Unyss we love you) and gents around the pool deserve extra regard for the dutiful presence and kindness shown throughout our stay. Same goes for the guys down at the beach shack who set us up for a great snorkel off the beach every morning.    We were fortunate to be there during Chef Nobu’s stay and that was an extra special experience. His food is sublime and he has cultured a great staff there. We would highly recommend the Teppan table experience there. Chef Hung immersed us in an unforgettable dining experience. The breakfast buffet is also some thing to be remembered, don’t miss out on the dim sum and fresh sashimi! Mr Ellison was also on the property but did not create a stir or disruption to the excellence of the staff. It was a pleasure to see.

Until then, they fade into the property, making guests feel that they have the place to themselves. My wife and I stayed here for our anniversary, selecting an Oceanfront room. When we were shown the room assigned to us, it was nice but fell short of our expectations, especially given the price we were paying. The hotel staff immediately worked with us and found another room that exceeded our expectations as it was an upgraded room type. It's hard to explain how peaceful and comfortable it was staying in our room.    We did do some hiking in the local area, rented a Jeep from the hotel to explore the island, visited Lanai City and the Cat Sanctuary but much of the time was spent enjoying the sunrises and sunsets from our room. If we needed a meal, it was as simple as ordering via smartphone. The food arrived hot and very well prepared, unlike any other hotel room service I've ever seen. This hotel knows what people expect and they work very hard to exceed those expectations.    This was our first time at a Four Seasons property and maybe I'm just new to this level of service but the Four Seasons Lanai was very expensive. The sooner you get over this and allow yourself to enjoy the property, the better. It made us giggle when the front desk asked if we were arriving at the airport by private jet or if they could come and get us via Lanai Air ($500/person, one way, private) One thing we did to help a bit was to buy champagne and some other items at the grocery store in Lanai city to take back to the hotel.

I'd left my sweater in one of they restaurants. Security returned it to me in a cute 4 Seasons bag with a bow. Just those kinds of nice touches. Pool guys/girls were unobtrusive but exactly there when you needed. The surf was a little rough when we were there, but we still got in. Be sure to walk around the point past the beach.

631927617,50,Great Resort!!,"I have a lot I can write about this resort, but I will try to keep it short. The resort, the only one on the island of Lanai, is amazing. They did not leave even one detail out. Each room is decorated impeccably and has the nicest amenities. Too often I find myself traveling to hotels with my own hair dyer from home - hotel hair dryers are usually so bad. Every room at the FS Lanai has the brand new Dyson blow dryer in it. I was pretty excited about that. They have multiple USB outlets next to the bed (on each side), and the toilets are robots (seriously). At the beach or by the pool, the service is amazing. They provide you with your own insulated water cooler for each water access. Food & drink service is great as well! It is a short/easy walk down to the pristine beach - groomed every morning for rocks. We found the beach to be quiet, not a lot of people and easy to have a spot to relax by yourself. They also have snorkel gear ready to go, if you want to jump in. Every view from the resort is breathtaking, and completely unobstructed. The staff was so friendly and genuinely happy to help. Most of the staff lives on the small island. They all seem very happy - it was wonderful. Each afternoon from 5:00 PM - 6:00 PM, the resort offers their version of a ""Happy Hour"", where they have a complimentary cocktail class in The Sports Bar. This is not to be missed! Fun cocktails and a great place to chat with others about your day. A few additional must-do activities - The Areal Yoga was so fun! Even if you have never taken a yoga class, you should try this out. The view from the yoga studio was breathtaking. The Snorkel Experience was also a blast.

620779812,40,Lovely resort on Lanai...,"My husband and I came to Lanai for a little R&R babymoon. We love Hawaii and the Four Seasons brand never disappoints (we are big fans of the FS Hualalai on Big Island). We had never been to Lanai so were excited to come out. The island is very quiet and the main economy seems to be all around the hotel. The resort was really lovely--beautiful beach, accessible trails close by, relaxing spa and wonderful gym. All the pools were great with plenty of chairs so you don't feel like you're constantly jockeying for great ocean view spots (unlike at FS Maui). The staff was courteous and professional--restaurant service was spot on. I would recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a quiet getaway. The FS Lanai Lodge is still under construction so not possible to stay/explore the lodge in town but all the activities are located close by to it (skeet shooting was fun) although we did enjoy the boat/fishing tour arranged by the hotel which is much closer to the resort to explore the beautiful ocean.  I will mention one small issue we had--there was a bit of an ant problem in our room--everyday many small ants swarming the bar area no matter how much we cleaned it, avoided leaving any open snacks/drinks in the area or cleared away whatever we could. It was a persistent problem limited to just that area only (I cannot speak to if other rooms had this issue).  The staff was very helpful in trying to address and housekeeping did clean it regularly but I do think stronger services would need to be called in to get rid of the problem completely (as everyday the ants came back). We were unable to change rooms since I believe resort was relatively full at that time. We completely understand that in hotels situated in more outdoorsy areas that a little bit of bugs may appear once in a while due to natural habitat--but this was def more of a continual issue.  The resort was wonderful so we do try to keep in perspective that it was a mild inconvenience in terms of big picture...but it was a bit stressful every time coming back to the room to constantly wipe ants away to keep the mini-population in check around the bar area during a relaxing babymoon.  To staff and management credit, when we bring this up they did do their best to address situation and did credit us a bit on our bill for the inconvenience at the end (and hopefully they can call in ant control to avoid future issues permanently). Overall--we really didn't want this to impact our trip and still enjoyed our time at FS and what the island has to offer.",Sep 2018,July 2018,Traveled as a couple,We had garden view room but if Ocean View rooms were available during our stay I'm sure they...,"Brooklyn, New York"

Hotel staff let the convention guests gather and drink and sing in common areas of the hotel well into the late evening which are very close to our room.

I do want to call out Mike from Malibu Farms who provided some needed beverages when we were powerless.    We are normally Hualalai folks but I have to say Lanai was next level.  The price was also next level - but at least the pricing made sense whereas for other properties lately price and quality are asymmetrical.  No questions asked here.    The *only* thing I think I would add is to expand the room service and/or malibu farms menus with more clean/organic dishes b/c after a week we really wanted simple / clean fare and more variety as my family is vegetarian.

I decided to select the Prime Oceanfront category because i wanted the best location and views and the garden views were a bit less expensive but if you are going to come to Lanai, just be prepared to spend money on your hotel and food and spa. When you arrive by ferry, there is a four seasons representative there to help with the luggage and drive to the hotel. The resort is about a 5 minute drive from the boat, you can also arrive by plane from Honolulu.    I won't lie, i had very high expectations just from looking at the pictures on the website, the pricing and the lovely reservations agent named Gem who worked with my on the hone a couple times. She was very helpful and professional. I asked for a quiet room and away from the main lobby area. We arrived and they took us thru this wonderful botanical and tropical walkway with all types of trees and plants and birds and fish and art , passing all these beautiful things as we wandered thru some different pathways, i felt immediately relaxed and at ease. When we got to our room, we were given to bracelets that looked like fit bits but inside the bracelet was the room key, so great, we wore our key and never had to worry about carrying a normal key. when we entered the room i was beyond happy and impressed, it exceeded my expectations and i was not sure how i would even leave the room because it was so luxurious and comfortable. the dark wood walls and the decor so warm and lush. loved the beautiful bathroom too. we were in room 1-214 and facing the sea.  we went to the restaurant to get in before the breakfast closed. it was such a beautiful setting nd the service was excellent and the food even better. loved the salmon sandwich which was really a salmon benedict on toast.. it was so good i ate it every day. we also enjoyed the breakfast buffet a couple times.  spent the day at the pool and under a nice big umbrella...excellent poolside service and being catered to by the staff is something they excel at    there was a beautiful beach which was fully attended to but i chose to stay up at the pool area. we spent time just relaxing and seeing what came next.    we ate at nobu which was delicious and the service was excellent and the setting even more beautiful everything we ate melted in our mouth and it ws just so amazing    i think the most amazing thing about this place is the absolute top notch luxurious accommodations and the property was stunning. i wasn't too happy we booked only two days there but we will definitely go back it is magical and very specialShow less",Aug 2018,August 2018,Traveled as a couple,,"Los Angeles, California"

607792032,50,The perfect Hawaiian experience!,"My husband and I just spent 6 amazing nights at the FS Lanai. The staff, hotel and island are the best of the best. We had a Garden View Suite that was perfect for our stay. We didn’t miss the ocean view in our room because we were rarely in it!    We took full advantage of the Love Lanai package - playing golf, shooting clays, UTV rides, horseback rides, fishing boats, and snorkel cruises. Each and every activity allowed us to interact with the amazing staff/locals and learn about this unique island. Transportation to each activity is well thought out, and after each activity you’re given water, snacks and hand towels to clean up. It is refreshing to know that even though we paid a substantial amount of money per night to stay here, we were never nickel and dimed.    We spent two nights eating dinner in Lanai City, meeting the wonderful owner of Pele’s and the Local Gentry, a great store to visit. The beautiful movie theater was a nice treat on a much needed night “off”.    David, the resort manager, is incredibly personable and kind. We got to know him well over the course of our stay. You can tell he loves his job and speaking with the many visitors he receives to the hotel each day.    When you need a good cocktail and meal, look no further than a barstool at NOBU. Marcom, the bartender, created the best cocktails we’ve ever had. We spent many nights getting to know him, and enjoyed his advice on menu choices and drinks. The meals we had at NOBU are some we will never forget. A must try is the local venison. It is incredible! They offer it in many forms on the different hotel menus.    I could go on forever about how much we enjoyed this hotel and island. It will always hold a special place in our hearts and we can’t wait to return.

605391678,40,"Super expensive and beautiful resort, some hiccups","This Four Seasons is on the small private island of Lanai (about 11x17 miles), facing the beach, and includes a spa, pool with pool bar, three restaurants, and easy access to horseback riding, archery, skeet shooting, and other outdoor activities, plus daily classes in yoga, native arts, etc. There are beautifully appointed 2-room suites in bungalows as well as rooms in the main building. The lobby is huge and beautiful and open to the sea and sea air. Staff all very friendly (though one does get tired of replying ""aloha"" to everyone all the time!). The grounds are amazingly lush and gorgeously landscape, and while the sea is a bit rough, it's still enjoyable. We've stayed at the Four Seasons on the big island so we had something to compare it to, and it's very close to a 5-star resort, BUT--    The main area in which we felt it fell short was the food. The two restaurants we mostly ate at (140 and Nobu) were about average -- food either oversalted, or a bit tasteless, or varied from the description (one day, shrimp wraps with avocado had no avocado, one day kale salad with garbanzo beans had no garbanzos, one day fresh fish was brought to the table and we watched in horror as the server poured a whole cup of hot sesame oil over it -- yuk! -- and mind you, this is a $50 piece of fish!). Likewise for bar food. We ate once at Malibu and it was a bit better, but not 5 star dining by any means. Some of the servers also seemed a bit confused -- English was perhaps a problem.    The other surprising thing was that one night the power went out (no fault of the resort's) and they were utterly unprepared. Instead of bringing out sandwiches and offering everyone free prosecco, the staff milled around in dismay and said there was no food. This went on for hours. They should have some sort of plan for these exigencies.    This place is unbelievably expensive, as I've mentioned. It was a special holiday for us, so we forced over the $2.5k a night for the room, but at that price everything should be just right. The hotel also runs a little slow on everything -- shuttles depart and arrive 15-25 minutes late, laundry doesn't come back and you have to call to find out where it went. And oddly, there are no amenities -- if you arrive without your toothbrush, you're out of luck.    So, would we come come? It's very nice, but probably not. We'd probably go back to the big island.",Aug 2018,August 2018,Traveled as a couple,,"Chicago, IL"

Even though it was low 80s during our stay, it never felt oppressively hot or uncomfortable. There is so much to do, see and experience.

602002749,50,A wonderful 5 star retreat,"Many resorts aspire to offer a retreat, few are blessed with a location or the seclusion to match the Four Seasons Resort on Lanai.

Certainly, the island is not a commercial affair, rather a laid back and secluded paradise.    The hotel Has a relaxed way of making you feel welcome and at ease. Wonderful choices of furniture, decor, artwork and materials create a haven of calm, but provide the practicality any weary or modern traveller might demand.    The staff are highly trained and attentive, the food superb. The Malibu Farm restaurant happily rivals the original with just the right blend of opulent and accessible food, always fresh and with a delicious twist. It also boasts a haven of calm.    All beaches on Hawaii are public, but the situation of the resort means that the albeit shared beach is naturally very quiet. The resort has a well-staffed outpost ready to take care of all needs. Note that the beach is a 5-10 minute walk from the main resort, down a relatively steep path, but golf buggies are ready to shuttle those who prefer to ride.

601975742,50,Stupidly perfect.,"""I am never leaving this place. They are going to have to drag my sunburnt body out out of this ridiculously comfy bed.""    This are the words I woke up to from my wife on our last morning here.    This is the place you've dreamed about. An oasis where every single thing has been thought out and optimized to perfection. A remote island paradise that's all of the things that Hawaii has always promised, but that's nothing of what modern day Hawaii has unfortunately become.    From the secluded location, to the outstanding quality, to the world class service to the truly exceptional well-appointed rooms.    We've been lucky enough to have experienced quite a number of ultralux properties over the years, but this resort is something special. Every element feels well thought out. There's a pride of place alongside a sense of community. All wrapped in an extremely polished exterior.    The good:    I cannot remember a resort where the food offerings were so strong across the board. Malibu farms is hyperlocal and honest. They also create the greatest fish sandwich imaginable. It's really that good. Nobu is always as good as the hype. I've been to other locations of this Nikkai network, and this consistently delivered the same outstanding creations. But perhaps the real star is One Forty. A restaurant that now owns the title of ""best breakfast I have ever eaten"" equally alongside ""spectacular dinner"". It's even worth going up to Views restaurant, particularly as they've found a way to incorporate the delicious deer that roam the island into their offer.    Facilities are top notch. The best room I've ever had at a Four Seasons. You don't have to troll for pool chairs, and all of the public spaces are instagram-worthy.    Golf is awesome. The beach is awesome. The activities are awesome.    Staff and service is as good as you expect from a brand synonymous with this.    The real treat is the Island of Lanai. You can easily venture into town. A warm community that's friendly and distinctly uncommercial. Do not miss the movie theatre, amongst the most unique and perfect places to see a film I've ever experienced.    You leave the earth.    Also good. It's extremely expensive. An amount that not only keeps away those who are unserious about their vacation, but also an amount that makes all involved realize how fortunate they are to have this experience. It's absolutely amazing how they can find a way to be so pricey but still make you feel that it's worth it.    The bad:    I guess it wasn't great that the parrots on the property didn't learn my name when they mimicked the ""aloha"". But that's grasping at straws.    It's hard to find very much wrong here. We weren't thrilled with the room service offering, but that could be just personal preference.    A truly fantastic resort. Perhaps the best we've ever been to.

596240056,50,A Truly Life Changing Experience,"I just spent five of the most glorious days on the island and have left a BIG BIG fan. Hawaii has always been a favorite vacation destination for myself and my clients (I am a destination wedding planner). After many trips to the islands, I assumed that the island would be pretty much the same, fabulous, but pretty much the same as what I had seen before. I could not have been more wrong. Our first conversation with the shuttle driver started our trip filled with wonderment at this little island paradise. I was mainly blown away by the pride and love the 3000 residents have for their island. They are also so happy to introduce you to the history and culture and make you feel so welcomed.    The resort was amazing from our first greeting with cold towels, fresh juices and leis (kukui nut for the gentlemen, orchid for the ladies). We were each individually escorted to our rooms with a very knowledgeable and kind staff member who gave each of us the highlights of the property. The resort is really well laid out where each space feels private and secluded while not feeling too spread out.    Overall, the staff were absolutely incredible. No issues whatsoever, they were all so pleasant. I love that the resort encourages a bit of personality remains along with their traditional Four Seasons training. It was wonderful to feel like you were truly connecting with a staff member because they were able to joke with you and chat with you without it all feeling so structured.    The Island has amazing activities. We went on the UTV excursion as well as a Skeet shooting excursion. There were also hikes, sunrise yoga, beachfront yoga, massages by the pool ... the options for activities are endless and with their Love Lana'i and Discover Lana'i packages that can be added on to rooms at the time of booking, many of these activities are free of charge (with the price of the package being added to your room night charge).    The dining is wonderful and the food itself is really well done. There are ample selections of traditional dishes as well as your everyday american fare. I felt that the pricing was accessible enough for dining options which really allowed me to explore foods I would not normally try but I fell in love with. The breakfast buffet is absolutely incredible and you have to try it at least one day. The options of food are endless and everything is even more delicious than the previous dish.    I also want to give a special call out to the resort general manager David who made sure his presence was felt throughout the trip. While we were on site (through social media) we figured out there were several celebrities on site as well. He still came to our group and greeted us each day, making sure we were all having a wonderful time. Even when I am sure his time was already limited with the VIP arrivals and needs, he still went above and beyond to make each person in our group feel welcomed.    All in all, this is not only an absolute fantastic resort, but a true haven for the novice or seasoned traveler. It is a place that works its way into your heart and will truly hook you. I cannot wait until my next opportunity to come back home to Lana'i.",Jul 2018,July 2018,Traveled on business,"There is truly not a bad room, but if you are looking for something truly spectacular, you must...",

Having stayed in some amazing resorts in Thailand, this resort had me feeling like it was missing something. For example the breakfast is 3 star at best, it is so bad and embarrassing for a resort of this calibre. I mean there is no selection of food, nothing for international guests eg Japanese, European or even people with dietary requirements.    The pools are very small in comparison to other resorts.

It freaked us a little and they offered to move us to another room on another floor. That was nice, but the room was not as nice (it was fine), and it took them so long to do this that we wasted hours waiting, and they didn't bring everything, so when I was dressing for the beach I could not find my swimsuit, and called the front desk and said it must have been in our first room. At first they said no, it wasn't there, but I insisted on looking for it myself, and there it was. Just more of our valuable (yes, lots of $$$$) time wasted.

593522254,40,"Well executed design, but lacking a little something..","I was very excited to visit the Four Seasons Lanai after Larry Ellison's purchase of the island and hearing about his extensive renovation plans for this property, and the entire island. I have grown up going to Hawaii and while I find the islands an amazing scenic destination, the vibe tends to be heavily oriented towards families even at its most luxurious resorts. The only exception to this (other than renting private homes/airbnb) I have found has been the Andaz Maui.    After hearing that a Nobu and Malibu Farm were on site, and learning the cost of Ellison's renovations, I was hopeful that this would be the 'chic' antidote to the ultra family resorts that I believe Hawaii has needed for a long time. While the resort is certainly beautiful, and constructed to incredibly high standards, the property and island left a little bit to be desired, perhaps because my expectations had been so high.    I'll start with the Highlights: The design aesthetic is very tasteful and all materials and finishes are of a high quality without being too flashy. There are many natural materials and woods keeping the feeling warm and organic. The walk and open air ""corridors"" to the guest rooms were a true high point. I enjoyed the walk to/from the room on every occasion as lush elaborate botanical gardens replete with rescued wild birds, lotus ponds and waterfalls surround a series of walkways and bridges to get to guestrooms. Truly stunning and unlike anything else I have seen in Hawaii. Guestrooms themselves are also beautifuly designed and decorated. Spacious, and comfortable, with amazing Four Seasons bedding. The bathroom was comfortable and stylish too with design features that were unique and cutting edge, but feel as though they are timeless enough to age well. Ellison signficantly cut back the number of rooms during the renovation, providing more suites and upgraded rooms. Most rooms feature some sort of view, and the oceanfront rooms offer unobstructed views. Rooms here though are very expensive, comparable to the ultra luxury resorts of the world, and given that the hotel was a renovation and not a new build they still feature an ""in-line"" set up. Many places at this price point in other parts of the world or Cabo perhaps might feature more of a 'villa feel' with more private terraces/ outdoor showers etc. that are not present here. That being said the room design was of a very high caliber.    The food on property is another highlight. Having Nobu on property is a plus, and Malibu Farm offers delicious lunch options although I wished there were even more healthy choices and more juices/ smoothies/ protein shake type options given a health conscious clientele. Even though Malibu farm boasts organic, fresh ingredients one still has to sift through the menu to find the trully healthy choices. The more formal steakhouse/ seafood restaurant was certainly fine but had a very high price point and was more akin to the typical ""hotel"" dining room offering. One note: we were there over peak season in Easter and some nights the restaurant prime times filled up. This seemed odd as the restaurants were NEVER full (there are only about 200 rooms and the restaurants are huge) but perhaps they want to space diners out to ensure quality service. The restaurants though never had a bustling feel and tables are quite spread out which is nice sometimes, but at others you want a little bit more energy and vibe.    The overall pool area grounds are beautiful and there are lots of lush private areas to sit. The best seats are on the oceanfront bluff with views down the coastline, rather than immediately adjacent to the pools. The gym was another highlight, large and modern with ample equipment and head on ocean views. The odd thing though is that it's right next to the lobby so you have to walk through the front desk area and main lobby to get to/from the gym, something I don't always want to do sweaty especially if I am working out later in the day when people are starting to congregate for happy hour or dinner.    The lowpoints: I can't seem to shake the fact that the pools are VERY small. There is one family/kids pool below the lobby that you see in your viewline when you walk in. It's pretty but seemed crowded and loud, likely due to its size. There is a slightly more removed adult pool with hot tub and waterfall cave but it's also VERY small and not far enough away from the kids pool to drown out all kid noises. I was told due to water restricitons, Ellison traded smaller pools for more water features in the botanical gardens on site. While the garedens are stunning, I think this was the wrong trade in some instances as a spectacular pool setting is critical at the ultra luxury resort in this day and age, especially when competing with the ultra luxe resorts of Cabo and Mexico. It made sitting by the pool not the most pleasant experience, and while the oceanfront bluff chaise lounge area was spectacular, it was a bit of a walk from the pool if you wanted to take a dip. The pools themselves did not feature ocean views (kind of odd for Hawaii, no?) .    The small pools might be alright if the beach were more spectacular. It's very scenic from AFAR. It's a short walk down the hill to the beach, which is public (though certainly not overcrowded due to its remote nature). The hotel sets up chairs and provides some beverage service (and will shuttle pool food down); however, no alcohol service is permitted on the beach as it's public. Furthermore the beach and water itself there aren't that spectacular compared to many others in Hawaii. Again the bluff tops closer to the resort are the place to be. Also, the restrooms down by the beach are public, which is fine too, but they should have been upgraded by the resort. As is, they are kind of gross to use and at $1000+ per night, expectations are a bit higher. Even at the pool, from most locations it's a good walk to the restrooms which seems like odd planning when so much money went into this property.    Perhaps our biggest problem with the Four Seasons Lanai is there just isn't that much to do there. Yes, that is sort of the point. We slept well, worked out, lounged and relaxed and all of that was great; however, for a 5 -6 night stay, one finds themselves craving at least one other dinner option, a nice bike ride (which cannot even be done from the resort), a good scenic hike nearby, a cute town to walk around, and Lanai really doesn't offer MUCH in this area. There is the Lover's Rock next to the beach that is a fun and scenic 20 minute hike, but doesn't occupy much time. We also took a jeep out four wheel driving one day and toured the whole island in about two hours. It was fun, but nothing was trully spectacular or memorable, especially compared to some of the spectacular hikes, waterfalls and scenery one can find on Kauai, Maui, the Big Island and even Oahu. The town itself is lackluster and isn't a particularly close or scenic drive to the resort either. The golf course though is spectacular. We don't golf but took to running and 'hiking' around the golf course paths a couple days for outdoor activities.    I think the island will gain more appeal when the inland Lodge at Ko'ele opens as it will provide alternative activity options, and more food and beverage options as well as a true destination spa/wellness center. The Spa at the resort now is literally in the basement of the main building and very expensive. At a resort of this caliber and at these prices, I would want a more top notch spa experience to justify a $300 massage including some indoor/outdoor experiences.    My review may sound overly critical, as the grounds and resort are tasteful and beautifully designed; however, to justify the expense and the journey of getting there (connecting flights from Honolulu required), or ferry from Maui, I was hoping for more ""vibe"" and perhaps even a feeling of more ultra luxury and exclusivity which was just a tad lacking.",Jul 2018,March 2018,Traveled as a couple,Oceanfront rooms at the end (West) have the best view of the sunset on property.,"Los Angeles, CA"

While the rooms and property were showing wear prior to the remodel, the charm and low key vibe was a big draw for us. Lanai is special - very few get her understated island energy which I feel the remodel pivoted from. The new pools and overgrown ""rain forest"" take away from the bay views and the oversized furniture in the rooms makes them feel rather 80's in style and claustrophobic. I don't write this to bring down the resort, as we had a great 4 days, the staff (especially Jay down at the beach who took excellent care of us everyday), but in hopes that the management will improve on the above.",Jun 2018,May 2018,,,"Los Angeles, California"

The week at Four Seasons Lanai was definitely the highlight. I have stayed at several Four Seasons resorts, West Palm, Chicago, Santa Barbara, others, and I felt I had high expectations, but Lanai blew them away. The technology imbedded in my room was beyond anyone's expectations, in particular the digital bathroom. The facility is second to none, the food was perfect the service impeccable.

We were generally very disappointed with the food and had to send back many selections. When we ordered in-room dining, my chicken dish was under cooked and raw.

Loved that the hotel offered Jeep rentals for the day to explore the island (highly recommended). Outstanding staff and service. The only criticism to note is that the pools are somewhat small and too shallow for adults to really enjoy. However, the pool area is beautiful and I enjoyed lounging and taking in the beach views. Service on the beach near the hotel was good. We saw a bunch of spinner dolphins from our breakfast table, which was delightful.

587919958,50,Top notch resort and family experience,"Our family of 5 visited the resort from June 3-8, 2018. From the airport lounge, to the Lanai airport transportation to check in was seamless. We have three teenage children that required 2 bedrooms. The partial ocean view rooms were just that and very remote in building 7. I was pleased with the location and very quiet, with deer roaming just outside the property line daily. I would suggest that if you have any physical limitations whatsoever, let the hotel know this in advance. It was quite a distance from our rooms to the lobby and particularly to the beach from this location. This was not a problem for our family.    The restaurants were excellent and the service great. We ate at all the restaurants and had room service. We would say that restaurant 140 and Nobu were the best. The breakfast buffet at 140 was very easy and had something for everyone.    We participated in many of the activities: snorkel/sail, archery/skeet shooting, jeep rental, free movie night in Lanai City, days at the beach and pool. When asking the family as a whole, their favorites were the jeep rental where we went to Lanai City, Garden of the Gods and Shipwreck Beach as well as the free movie night. My favorite was the beach but I did feel that more choices could be added other than snorkel masks. In other words, there were no paddle boards, boogie boards, surf lessons, etc. The surf lessons were something that my boys were looking for. Too much surf for the majority of snorkelers at this time year.

From the time I stepped into the Four Seasons lounge in HNL airport, I knew this trip was going to be luxurious. The resort was immaculate and the staff was very attentive and caring. It truly felt like they were genuinely interested in making you feel at home at the resort. Restaurants were great. Definitely try the Poke-viche at Malibu Farms ! As far as activities go, the pool and beach are great. If you are a fan of dolphins, you can see them from the beach as that area is a spinner dolphin resting area. If you had jet lag like I did and was awake in the early morning, do the sunrise hike to check out Sweetheart Rock. The hotel will have the schedule of when the guided hike tour leaves from the lobby. Also, probably one of the best things we did was the UTV tour. If you want to see the rest of the untouched island, you can’t go wrong doing the tour. Imagine zipping along at 50+ MPH along dirt roads with the wind blowing in your face experiencing the beauty of the island that you don’t see from the resort.

586521816,50,Wants to be the best. Comes very close.,"Would give 4.5 stars but I will round up. Arrived after 18 hours from the east coast.  Arrival was easy and cordial. They pick you up at the airport and help you with your luggage. First thing we did is go to sports bar and get some dinner. Please realize that this is a FS hotel on an island that only gets a barge once a week so the food prices are high. Hamburger is 28 bucks but comes with any side and is delicious and big enough to share. Breakfast buffet is bountiful and fresh. From sushi to bulgogi bowls and fresh omelette they will get you whatever you want. Also they have made to order pancakes etc. Room is adequate size and very well appointed with a very comfortable bed. We were upgraded to oceanfront after “upgrading” us to partial ocean that had some sort of pool pump or generator in front of it. New room had amazing view of the “blowhole” I would recommend this area of the hotel! Also would get a discover lanai package as they give you a nice resort credit. We used it for skeet shooting a sunset sail and the spa, for example. Dinners are limited as you have 3 choices. The steak place was ok. Nobu was excellent but you can drop 300 there on a couple easily. We ended up eating there 3 times. It is managed by the hotel and the staff there are super nice. Pools are small. There is an adult area. There are cool private areas that you can lay around and feel relatively isolated. Drinks are good and around 16-20.00. TBT that if you are going to watch what you are spending then the resort might not be the best for you. It’s for the .01% or honeymoon ers/splurgers. The best part of the resort are the views of the bay and the service. There are nicer hotels and better food elsewhere but the combination of service and location make this place hard to beat. If you can afford it try the dining under the stars. It’s a unique experience and that’s why you are there anyway.",Jun 2018,June 2018,Traveled as a couple,,"Miami, Florida"
586505658,40,Mr. Ellison’s Vision Of Paradise,"We arrived from the east coast and stayed for 8 nights at this beautifully renovated resort! Sleek and sexy with dark woods and lush gardens this is an escape from the busyness of Maui and other islands. The staff are all friendly and remember you by name. Aloha is the “good morning” rapport every day. The shuttle picks you up from the small airport and 15-20min later you are on your way to Mr. Ellison’s dream of paradise. Back to the views ... amazing as soon as you step into the wide open foyer the blue green Pacific Ocean in Hulupoe bay is crashing and foaming. The 2 pools are onyx colored diamond brited giving it a native and rustic look. The pools could have been larger. There was one for adults and one for families each with a jacuzzi.  The room was spacious and cleaned twice daily. The beds were very soft and luxurious. A great 70 inch flat screen. The bath products were by a local Hawaiian company. The Toto toilet was a great addition as well as the Dyson blow dryer. Remote controlled dark shades over the sliders and drapes.  The 4 restaurants were open. We booked with AMEX Platinum and received the $55 daily breakfast buffet complimentary. This was excellent- Asian, (dimsum, sashimi,miso), egg station, fresh local fruits (papaya,longan,lychee,) Korean bulgogi, breakfast pastries, bread,bagels,and cookies, Maui kombucha, fresh squeezed juices, cereal, yogurt... never get bored for breakfast!! Our upgrade was changed once because the first room was next to a generator/pump that vibrated noisily and my husband had to go down to the front desk to request a change which they gave to us.  As for the food....  The 140 restaurant was where breakfast was daily and dinner was available there too. We liked 140 steakhouse but wished the option of a ribeye steak was on the menu. We dined 4 times at Nobu. The sashimi and sushi was excellent. Very expensive but worth it. We also ate at the Sports Bar quite a few times for lunch and dinner and enjoyed that as well. The beef burger being the favorite and the seasonal salad. Malibu Farms we enjoyed the local catch sandwich and hot dog. Dining Under the Stars was the highlight of the trip. Chef Kemar envisioned our meal perfectly.  As for the ocean and snorkeling this time of year,beginning in June, the southern swells were strong and crashing with 6 feet surges. Definitely not ideal for snorkeling. No one informed us of that before we booked. We came for the snorkeling in the bay. Even wading was near impossible because of the strength of the pacific undertow!  Mainly we stayed on the beach and poolside and sunbathed. We even saw spinner dolphins in the Bay! The staff was always gracious and helpful. The prices of the drinks were reasonable averaging $17 ,according to my husband. We also tried the Discover Lanai package. We went on the sunset sail( too wavy, many people complained of feeling nauseous- we thought they should’ve cancelled it), we cancelled snorkeling because of that. We went skeet shooting and archery in the upcountry. Cooler by 10 degrees- but very fun. My husband did the massage therapy and loved it. Many people visited Lanai City but we did not visit the Lanai City. We did take the ferry to Maui -45 min went by quickly. We walked around Lahaina and it was very commercialized but we enjoyed it.  The last 2 days we did experience the VOG from the kaileau volcanoe. A light haze and fog during the day made it more humid but nothing bothered us respiratory-wise.

Spa: Guests have complementary access to the spa facilities that includes sauna and steam room. They have great protein bars made by the restaurant especially for the spa. Be sure to try them. Pool side massage was very relaxing. Highly recommended.  Restaurants: One Forty, Sports Bar and Malibu Farms have amazing options. One Forty has great outside seating area. Restaurant Manager Paola was amazing - Sports bar has a nice atmosphere and the staff is attentive. She took care of us throughout our stay and made it feel special. Do not miss the ginger ice cream sandwich!  Front desk: Luna is an amazing girl. Full of energy and helped us with every request or question we had.  Amazing staff: Always smiling and happy to delight the guests. Truly amazing staff and great customer service!  Activities: All the paid activities (horse back riding - Molly the instructor is the best, skeet shooting, picnic under the star and sun set sail) were amazing. Some of the activities are complementary for the guests including morning meditation class, snorkel gear at the beach, tai chi, etc. Guests are provided with activities sheet at check in process which I thought was very helpful.

585077163,50,Amazing Property!,"My wife and I visited Lanai for the first time last week. In short, our stay was amazing. We spent five nights in one of the prime ocean view rooms directly overlooking the ocean which was maybe 100 yards away from our balcony. The room was beautiful and comfortably decorated. The balcony was rather large, and we enjoyed in-room breakfast on the balcony several mornings.    We participated in several of the activities offered by the hotel, including the snorkeling adventure, ATV tour and Jeep rental. The snorkeling trip was on a large catamaran that consisted of a 3 hour trip, including about 90 minutes of snorkeling / enjoying the water at the snorkeling site. Food and drinks were provided. The boat crew were great.    On our Jeep rental day, we explored several parts of the island. Most of the roads on the island are unpaved, so a 4X4 Jeep is a perfect way to explore. We saw some beautiful sights including isolated pristine beaches, mountain overlooks and beautiful forests. We easily filled an entire day driving around the island and exploring.    The ATV tour was the most exciting of the adventures. The ATVs were large 4 seater side-by-sides driven by knowledgeable and capable guides. The tour consisted of high speed trail riding up and down beautiful mountain trails where we reached speeds of 70 mph in some places. The trails included jumps and seriously challenging terrain which the ATV handled with ease. There were periodic stops along the trails where we learned about the history of the island, its economy and various other interesting bits of information. There were also several scenic overlooks that offered great photograph opportunities and beautiful views.    The pools at the hotel were beautiful and never crowded. We especially enjoyed the secluded adults-only pool and hot tub area. Pool attendants provided great service including drinks and food. The sandy part of the beach available for swimming, etc. was a little bit of a walk (probably about 10 minutes) down a path from the hotel property. Beach attendants provided chairs, umbrellas and served food and drinks.    The restaurants on the property were great. We had dinner at both One Forty and Nobu. Breakfast and lunch on the property generally ran about $100 each and dinner was $200 - $400 for two people.

581880879,10,Dissatisfactory service and stressful getaway,"I was so excited to spend a much needed relaxing weekend at the Four Seasons Lanai, but it resulted in a lot of stress and frustration. I traveled alone in hopes of a nice getaway. I was so disappointed:    1. Unsafe  One of the rescue birds, Ke’oke’o, came up to me while I was leaving the pool and bit my toes. There was no one monitoring him. The staff was slow to respond to me even though I was in pain, bleeding, and clearly upset. I was disappointed that no one offered to assist me or tried to make me feel better. The staff was negligent to protect their guests from the birds. The only excuse I heard was, “oh he’s just attention seeking.” My foot was bleeding and I couldn’t walk. I was so stressed on a vacation that should have been relaxing.    2. Unattentive staff  In addition to the lack of safety at the resort, the staff was not attentive. I was almost never assisted at the pool or the beach. I had to flag someone down for help, which is unacceptable for a resort like this. I even got some additude from the staff at the beach when I asked for a chair. I felt like I was such an inconvenience for the staff. I should feel welcomed.    3. Restaurant service  The food was terrible at both the pool and the Sports Bar. Since there are no “quick grab options,” you have to wait a long time to get fed. As someone who runs around a lot, this was frustrating to me. My fish came out very salty for dinner at Sports Bar, but no one came to check in on me to see how I was doing. I was too tired to flag people down and had to eat the disgusting meal. When I was at the pool, the staff failed to even take my order. I had to run to the front desk to get some attention. Not relaxing.    Overall, if you’re looking for relaxation, don’t come here. You’ll leave with even more stress after running after the staff. You’ll get bitten and bleed all over the place and have terrible pain in your feet. And then feeling remorse for having to complain. I felt feelings I did not want to feel during a resort vacation. I should have just stayed home.",May 2018,May 2018,Traveled solo,,"Honolulu, Hawaii"

581747065,10,NOT happy with the renovation,"I visited the Manele Bay Hotel -- now called the Four Seasons Resort, Lanai -- 5 times over the course of the past 22 years. Each time I have visited, the resort has become more expensive. Each time I visited, I liked it less.    This most recent visit was the most disappointing. For some reason, they decided to build foliage all over the resort so the vast majority of views are blocked (you used to be able to see the beautiful ocean from all over the resort). The renovated rooms contain all sorts of unnecessary and counterproductive upgrades -- from huge wall-sized tvs to toilets with 100 different functions. The decor now is dark rather than the original white pineapple-decor.    The restaurants also have changed -- sizes are much smaller and prices monumentally higher. It was close to impossible to feed our family of 4 for anything less than $200/day. After spending the amount we did on the room, this was unwelcome and felt punitive. Plus, sadly, there were almost no vegetarian options!    Possibly the worst part of all is the absence of dolphins. The first 4 times I visited, dolphins used to swim right into the lagoon at the resort. This time, we hardly saw ANY dolphins the entire week -- even when we went out on snorkel boats. It is like they have been scared away.    This is literally my fourth attempt to post a negative review of this resort. TripAdvisor keeps preventing it from being posted. I think that travelers should be entitled to hear different perspectives before spending their hard-earned thousands of dollars on one of the most expensive -- and formerly one of the nicest -- resorts in the world. I have traveled extensively and have stayed in this exact resort numerous times; I hope that TripAdvisor will consider posting this review.

581726765,50,Like a luxury island summer camp for grown-ups,"We recently celebrated an anniversary at the Four Seasons and loved every minute of it. We loved the resort grounds as not only is it structured for privacy and quiet, but extremely clean and immaculately groomed with plant life and water features. We tried all of the restaurants except Views (at the golf course, only open for lunch) and found the quality of the food and drinks to be excellent, especially at Malibu Farms. The breakfast buffet is pricey, but worth it as we often stuffed ourselves so full that we skipped lunch (kind of convenient if you had an activity-filled day). The rooms are beautiful and well-maintained (housekeeping made every grain of errant sand disappear) with delightful little lighting and tech touches everywhere. The beach feels like a private escape, with totally clear water, occasional visits from a 90-dolphin pod and plenty of sea life for snorkeling. Alcohol is not allowed on the beach (which we didn’t mind at all as you can booze up pretty much everywhere else) and there is no lifeguard, but I did notice beach staff watching guests like a hawk to make sure everyone was safe. What really distinguishes this property is the level of service that enhances your stay; thank you to Amanda at the front desk who helped us navigate some tricky activity scheduling, Leo and Fred with their masterful UTV driving, Dennis with his consummate clay shooting instruction and patience, Bruno the bird caretaker, all three Captains on the catamaran, the stable staff, the beach staff, restaurant staff and many, many others who attend to every detail to make sure your experience is special. Our least favorite experience was golf; the staff seemed a little off but am guessing it’s because of the renovation efforts that are ongoing. We also made use of the HNL airport lounge (small but serene) which was a nice touch. All in all, our experience on Lanai was different from our time on any other island because of the meticulously curated activities (like adult summer camp!), the feeling of a gloriously uncrowded island and the exceptional level of service. We had a blast and can’t stop talking about it. Can’t wait to return!",May 2018,May 2018,Traveled as a couple,,"Denver, Colorado"
581534969,50,Spectacular Property,"We had been here a number of years ago with the family and loved it. With all the recent renovations, particularly to the rooms and restaurants, it is now even better. If you want activities, they have them---pools (adult and kids), beach, spa, golf, archery, skeet shooting and various adventures (helicopter and snorkeling for example). The quality of the food at all of the dining establishments is first rate. If you want sushi, there is a Nobu Lanai. If you want steak there is One Forty. Malibu Farms is more of a California Coast cuisine and the Sports Grill & Bar has food similar to a gastropub.

580145458,50,Only a 6 star rating will do. Fantastic all around.,"In true Four Seasons style, the Lanai resort is top notch.  I have visited this hotel twice in the last 12 months and would give it a 6 star rating.    Four Seasons now has a private lounge in the Honolulu airport reserved for Lanai guests. Its a nice little diversion from the airport and has that FS touch of hospitality with light snacks, comfortable seating and charging stations. We also had an opportunity to take the private plane from Honolulu to lanai which is one of the VIP experiences offered by the hotel. You are greeted by a concierge at the gate in honolulu and escorted to the runway by private chauffeur to board your private plane. The crew was very accommodating and every detail was covered in true four seasons style.    I have stayed in both the Four Seasons Ocean Front Studio Suite and the Ohana One Bedroom Suites. Both are fantastic. The views here are amazing on all sides with private terraces that invite you spend time outdoors. I always enjoy getting room service and having breakfast on my terrace. The beds are very comfortable and the Four Seasons extras like remote controlled room darkening shades enhance a relaxing night of sleep.    Dining at the hotel is superb with both One Forty and Nobu on site. I recommend going with the chef's selections at Nobu. My favorites are the black cod or black cod with lettuce cups. The sushi selection is invigoratingly fresh and amazing. I would also recommend the wagu steak cooked on a lava rock at the table.    One Forty is also fabulous and I love the One Forty Cabernet that was created specifically for the Four Seasons. Its outstanding and a great price. My favorite dish is  the Steamed Onaga with Shiitake Mushrooms, Bok Choy, Ginger, Japanese White Soy. The steaks are wonderful as well. Breakfast at One Forty is very diverse and offers many selections from around the world.    The spa is on the smaller side, but the treatments are top notch. The pools and grounds are a lush and tropical paradise with lots of small spaces to enjoy a private moment, read a book or take a nap. The ocean and beach are beautiful. We saw whales and tons of dolphins on both trips to Lanai.    I am thrilled to be going back for my 3rd visit and would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a truly relaxing vacation with fantastic service, gourmet food and amazing surroundings.

580013907,50,The Heart of Hawaii with the Soul of the Four Seasons,"We have been to FS Wailea and FS Hualalai. Both are great, but this is our new favorite Four Seasons resort. The resort is perfectly situated on beautiful Manele bay. It offers all of the natural surroundings with the refinements and details that Four Seasons does so well. Our experience started at the Four Seasons lounge at the HNL airport. There, we were checked into our rooms and we were given our key bracelets. They also gave us a list of daily activities. After a very short flight, we were on Lanai. The FS staff does a really nice job of getting all of its guests to the resort and then back to the airport. We spent four nights at the resort. We loved the view of the ocean and of Maui, but we especially enjoyed watching the deer from our room as they congregated in the gully next to the resort. The hiking was fantastic and we enjoyed the Fisherman’s trail and the Sweetheart trail. The pool lounge chairs are set up really well in lots of little pockets of space. Service at the beach and the pool was outstanding. We took the complimentary shuttle into town and we went to see the miniature horses at the stables. Bruno introduced us to the resident birds that live onsite at the resort and we enjoyed learning about the birds from him.    Here is a rundown of the restaurants. We are pretty loyal to the Four Seasons brand and dining has a lot to do with that. There was a lot of “table touching” by the restaurant managers. It seemed important for the staff to get to know guests, table preferences,  etc.    One Forty- we ate breakfast here each morning and ate dinner here twice. They offer a buffet and a la carte options for breakfast. I love breakfast at the Four Seasons! For dinner, One Forty offers fish, steaks, and beautiful views. Jojo made sure that everything was perfect.    Sports Bar - we ate lunch and dinner here. We loved the relaxed atmosphere. Our meals were excellent (burgers, market salad, fresh fish). Desserts here are not to be missed - cheesecake and brownie sundae! In the early morning, the bar offers complimentary coffee along with grab n go options for purchase. Get the purple donut!!!    Nobu- this is a great Nobu experience, but with views. The restaurant and bar have a sexy vibe.    Malibu Farm- the food that is served poolside is from Malibu Farm. Cocktails were creative and the beer was ice cold. We also went to the restaurant for lunch. The shrimp skewers, pokeviche, and grilled cheese were delicious.

578695929,40,"Hawaii, without the tourists","We purposely went against the grain when we booked our 5 night stay at the Four Seasons Lanai. Multiple online recommendations from people, travel blogs, etc. seemed to urge tourists to focus most of their time on the more ""popular"" Hawaiian islands like Maui, Kauai, etc. – and only spend a day or two in Lanai.    For us, the ideal Hawaiian vacation was to avoid all that, and find a place where tourist interactions were minimal, and where we could enjoy a true indigenous island experience without flying to the remote corners of the earth since we conveniently live in San Francisco (only 5-6 hr. flight away). Lanai delivered on this 100%.    The newly renovated Four Seasons Lanai is beautiful, and the focus on design is everywhere. From the moment we entered the resort, it was clear it would be different here (we'd previously taken vacation in Kauai and Maui). The private feel of the beach and ocean surrounding the resort separated it from the cramped touristy feel of the hotels and resorts on Maui, or the up & coming busy hustle on Kauai – especially in the popular beach areas. At the Lanai Four Seasons, it was quiet, calm, and relaxing. Upon checking in, guest services surprised us with an upgraded to an ocean view suite, vs. the ocean view room we'd originally booked. It was our Baby Moon, so this upgrade was more than welcome since this was an important time for us to be together!    The room #6221 was gorgeous in every way. We'd HIGHLY recommend others booking this exact room, or, the one above it if you can swing the cost. The room was impeccably designed with warm wood tones, beautiful architectural detail, and lavish furniture. Everything was spotless, which was something we noticed immediately since we're particularly aware of scuffs on walls and on furniture in hotels and resorts. The 2 large bathrooms were designed to be enjoyed rather than just being utilitarian, with rain fall shower heads, wood soaking tubs, and modern automatic toilets that we'd only seen in luxury hotels and ryokans in Japan. The view from the porch was stunning, overlooking the beach & ocean.    The only reason we're giving this a 4-start rating instead of 5 was for two factors: The first factor was the insulation between the floors. It was surprisingly lacking since all the rooms have wood floors (not carpet). The Four Seasons Lanai is a 2 story resort. So if you're on the bottom floor and there's a family above you, or, a heavy stepper, you will hear their every movement including the sliding glass doors opening and closing. This was disappointing to us since the entirety of the resort aside from that was impeccable. We awoke every morning to the foot steps of the family above us which wasn't great due to the fact that we're both light sleepers. The second factor was the steep cost of the restaurants on the property – likely due to the fact that people staying in the resort do not have easy access to surrounding restaurants in the town's center. So we had to bite the bullet like others and just pay the high prices. To be fair, the Four Seasons Lanai does offer free shuttle services into town every hour which was extremely nice. So we took advantage of this a few times to go into the quaint town center and have breakfast and lunch.    The Four Seasons Lanai also offers Jeep rentals which we took advantage once during our stay. If you're planning on considering this, have an honest conversation with the front desk *prior* to renting the Jeep to find out what the road conditions are like. There's only a few paved roads on Lanai, and most are extremely bumpy dirt roads only suitable for 4x4 Jeeps. If it's been raining (which it had before we arrived), these dirt roads get flooded and washed out, rendering them useless to drive thru. The Four Seasons Lanai doesn't recommend users to push through these large mud puddles (they actually look like small ponds) because previous guests have gotten stuck and had to be towed (which is a $500 fee). So net-net, we were only able to drive the Jeep on a few roads, and see only one of many sites on the island which doesn't exactly make the $200/day cost worth the effort. But this was a learning experience for us, and we'll know next time to skip this if the roads are washed out.    Overall, the experience was satisfying, and we'd do it again (except next time, we'd make sure to secure a top floor room above where we stayed last time). The beach which is an easy walk from the resort was beautiful with few tourists on it. And the overall feeling of the small island make you feel like you were transported to another world. It was wonderful, and exactly what we'd been looking for.    We'd definitely recommend the Four Season Lani to anyone who's design conscious, and is looking to seriously get away from all the touristy nonsense of the more popular islands and relax in an authentic island environment.    We were also grateful of the kind upgrade the Four Seasons Lanai gave us during this important Baby Moon trip. We'll always remember that! :)",May 2018,May 2018,Traveled as a couple,"If you want the perfect stay, rent the room #6221, or, the room above that.","San Francisco, California"

Sucks to get sick in paradise, but the resort was truly helpful in making sure I got the quick care I needed. The adventure center is awesome and run very well (UTV is a great experience).

575820717,50,"SIMPLY EXCEPTIONAL, AMAZING STAFF","I have visited Lana’i three times but it has been about ten years since my last visit. It has always been one of my favorite places and I was nervous that I would not like the changes on my most recent visit. That being said, it was as close to perfect as perfect can be. It was well worth the long flight from New York especially with their new private air charter from Honolulu. They meet you at the gate of your inbound flight and transfer you by Escalade to your awaiting private plane to the island. From there, you have a private transfer to the resort in one of their Mercedes SUVs. The resort’s best feature is its staff and their warm welcome upon pulling up to the resort makes you feel at home. The service is simply exceptional from management to the gardeners. The food is divine, the food may actually be better at Nobu on Lana’i than here in New York. The steak at One Forty was cooked perfectly and the food at both Views and Malibu Farm was also very good. The rooms are newly renovated and very comfortable with every possible convenience. The addition of the second pool which is adults only made a world of difference especially considering we visited over spring break. That being said, I cannot say enough great things about the staff, they exude true hospitality and fulfill every request, some if not most have been there since my last visit! My only recommendation is that if you are visiting other islands, make Lana’i your last stop because I went there first and wound up leaving another resort on another island which is supposed to be “the best” which will remain nameless and I came RUNNING back to The Four Seasons Lana’i because it literally blows everything else in Hawaii away.

I guess the message was not relayed to the kitchen staff because guess what? As soon as the first spoonful touched my lips, I knew it was contaminated with banana. Luckily, I didn't ingest a lot because I found out that the hotel does not have any Epi-pens and the nearest doctor was 30-45min away. They also do not have anti-histamines available for their guests. Instead, the security staff told us to purchase anti-histamines from the hotel store. No, they did not reimburse us for the cost of the medicine even though it was their fault. The only thing they did was give me a bottle of water and said there's nothing they can do.    When I got back to my room, I had severe stomach cramps and spent the rest of the day hobbling back and forth from my bed to the toilet. I ordered clear broth from room service to soothe my stomach and they even tried to charge me $30 for clear chicken broth! Thankfully, the lady at the check-out counter waived this charge when we complained.    As you can imagine, this is not what I envisioned my honeymoon to be.

You can go from 140, to Sports Bar, to Room Service, or Malibu Farms, and find different choices at each. (I'm not a fan of Nobu, but it's there too)    If you don't want to leave the resort? At All? You don't have to.. there's a beautiful beach, a fantastic spa, great pools and several easy walking trails.    But there's also a wonderful Hawaiian island to explore, with hiking trails, red dirt roads, deserted beaches... and a cat sanctuary for some feline time. :)    My only complaint would be that we have had an ""off"" experience every other trip. Almost as though we're forgotten when we return. The hotel is still perfection, but the service is a little lacking (forgetting airport shuttles, room cleanings, etc), and on the last trip - our room looked like it had barely survived the previous guests - broken marble, missing screen doors, tears in the carpet, even glass was missing from a table. Still worth it, but frustrating.    I also highly recommend adding a duvet or two for the bed, they're a bit stiff this round.",Apr 2018,March 2018,Traveled with friends,"Any room with an ocean ""view"" to hear the waves at night.","Seattle, Washington"

However at night it could have used brighter bulbs. The hotel is situated among beautiful gardens and ocean views. The beach was not large. However, the hotel had several lovely pools scattered about the property. There are several restaurants affiliated with the hotel. Those not immediately on the property near the rooms could be reached by complimentary shuttle. Among the gardens there were tropical birds and koi ponds. The rooms include complimentary WiFi and many amenities. There was ample storage. Note that Lanai is not your typical Hawaiian island. Most of the island is red dirt.

572267395,50,Incredible!,"There’s a reason U.S. News ranked Four Seasons Lanai the #1 hotel in the United States – this property is simply amazing! My wife and I experienced outstanding customer service from the moment of arrival at the complimentary HNL Four Seasons lounge until departure on the private airport shuttle. It is the very definition of a luxury, 5-diamond resort.    The open air lobby showcases the magnificent view and provides and instant sense of relaxation. The resort grounds are immaculately landscaped and the two pools are gorgeous. No fighting for chairs here either – there’s an abundance of comfortable lounge chairs and high-end umbrellas each with their own unique view and atmosphere. If lounging at the pool all day isn’t your thing, local hiking is great and the beach is a short walk down the path. The same Four Seasons service is offered there with the addition of complimentary snorkel equipment. We dined at each of the resort’s restaurants on numerous occasions and every meal was fantastic.    In regards to the room, my wife and I were lucky enough to stay in the Ohana Suite. It was hands down the most stunning accommodations we’ve ever had throughout our travels to luxury properties around the world. The modern design, art, technology, and amenities were all amazing.    The entire staff was outstanding and we were constantly greeted by name throughout our stay. The management team even hosted a cocktail reception to welcome and get to know the clientele. Thanks to the Resort Manager, David Arraya, for taking time to socialize with guests and for the genuine conversation. I must also recognize Erin Quon, the Director of Rooms, for her exceptional customer service. She was an absolute pleasure to work with and went above and beyond to make our trip special.

Been traveling all around Hawaii for the last 20+ years and this hotel is my absolute favorite. All of the staff are genuinely amazing and go out of their way to get whatever you want. Special shout out to Meesa as nobody works harder than him. All the food and drinks are amazing! The spa this trip was a huge improvement from last year when it had just opened. Perfect this time. Therapists doing the pool massages were all great! I absolutely love this beautiful hotel and island and will be back again next year. Also all of the excursions and activities are run with the same great service you get at the hotel. Did a private catamaran for a day and the staff were absolutely wonderful. Another thing to note is that when my son got sick and needed medicine at 2am the hotel immediately sent security to drive us to get care and his meds and return us safely back to the hotel. Never had such caring service anywhere before. One area to improve on is service at Nobu. Still very inconsistent and that shouldn’t happen at this price point.

571283543,50,Not Quiet Maui-Level But Still Excellent,"As most travellers probably are considering the Maui FS against Lanai, Ill compare the two. Basically, the Lanai FS is like a mini version of the Maui FS with some unique features, excelling in some areas, but falling short in others. In the excels category, they have exclusive access to an awesome Jack Nicklaus golf course. Phenomenal service there and breathtaking views. The Maui courses are OK, but not connnected to the property and lacking on the service end. Also, as this was during Spring Break, it was nice not to have to wait for ANYTHING. Golf, pool chairs, restaurants. versus Maui FS where it is a zoo this time of year. Everything is laid back here the way Maui used to be. There was a very famous celebrity here this week, and everyone just left him alone with his family. The rooms here are an order of magnitude better than MAUI FS. Room service electronic ordering was flawless and when you check in, you have an individual greeter come and get you and check you in. no lines. Now in the Lacking category. The ferry is a hassel. Apparently it’s much easier to fly here. You lose about 3-4 hours of your vacation dealing with the boat. Also, the Lanai FS has limited selection of wines, food items, and convenience store sundries. The biggest issue I have with the place is the pool. They are not up to FS standards. Small kids pool, with no slides ans the adult pool is something you’d find in someones backyard. There is plenty of space here — Larry needs to build a top level vanishing edge adult pool right below the existing ones and then made the kids poolls more interesting. The beach is also a bit of a walk versus Maui where its right there. Food wise, the main restaurant is very good. Nobu is awesome. Maui Farms is fine for pool service, but dont go there for dinner.

570308986,50,My all-time favorite Four Seasons property,"I've had the privilege of staying in many Four Seasons properties across the U.S., and the Four Seasons Lana'i is my all-time favorite.    It's been nearly 3 years since I took a vacation, and when I started researching potential vacation ideas I automatically focused on Four Seasons properties due to the world-class service, comfort, and luxury these hotels always deliver.    I'd never heard of the Four Seasons Lana'i, but after reading the TripAdvisor reviews talking about how secluded the property is, I was sold.    I stayed for a week in March 2018, and on the night we checked in (after an exhausting 20-hour travel day), my husband and I were so impressed by the Partial Ocean View room that we immediately wanted to extend our stay.    The hotel manager, David Arraya, was kind enough to upgrade our room type at check-in, and also graciously offered us the additional nights at an amazing rate. All of my interactions with David make it clear why he manages this superlative resort: he's friendly, efficient, and very responsive with all requests.    Our Partial Ocean Suite was beyond our expectations: extremely luxurious but not at all ostentatious. It had a lanai that was twice the size of my first NYC apartment, a living/dining room, bedroom, *two* full bathrooms (such a luxury to get ready for dinner without having to take turns in the bathroom), and at least three large closets.    Every room was spacious, tastefully appointed, and extremely comfortable. As other reviewers have noted, the technology in the rooms add to the comfort, as the controls for everything from blackout shades to dimmers are thoughtfully placed exactly where you need them.    The food at the hotel was (mostly) delicious. My favorite meal each day was breakfast (and I am *not* a morning person) because of the lovely and expansive breakfast buffet. In addition to the classic American breakfast items, the buffet also features a juice bar, Japanese breakfast items, and Chinese breakfast items. As an Asian American who loves food, that buffet was my jam. My first morning I tried six different fruits that I'd never eaten before. Also, the gluten-free muffins at the buffet are the Best. Ever. I've been gluten-free for 8 years and usually eating GF baked goods are like kissing your sister: there's no point. But these muffins are so good I asked for the recipe.    We ate mostly on property and the food was by and large excellent. Our lunches delivered to the beach were delicious and hot. The venison pizza from the sports bar is, in my husband's words, ""the best pizza I've had in years.""    The only culinary disappointment at the resort was Nobu, where we dined on our second night. The food was just so-so compared to the other Nobu locations in NY and Las Vegas, and worst of all, we were freezing. I told my waiter I was cold, and asked if they had heat lamps. He said ""yes, we just got new ones!"" but when I asked him to bring one to the table, he declined and instead brought me a wrap. That helped, but once the sun went down it got legit *cold*. Even my husband, who runs hot, eventually got cold enough to mention it to the waiter. Again, the waiter (cheerfully but rather obliviously) declined to turn on the space heaters, and so we told him we were too cold to order dessert. He cheerfully said he'd bring our check, and this took *over ten minutes* during which my husband and I sat there in increasing discomfort. Note that the restaurant was not even halfway full, and the waiter obviously knew we were eager to leave. When he finally brought the check, he said ""I know you're cold, but feel free to sit as long as you like."" Um, what? Our dinner at Nobu was the one exception to the amazing service we received throughout our stay.    I highly recommend the Lana'i City Grill, which is a 20-minute shuttle ride away. The food is delicious, fresh, inventive, and very reasonably priced. They have live music on Friday and Saturday nights, which hit just the right fun, relaxing island vibe.    The Four Seasons excursions we tried were great. We rented a Jeep and went off-roading around the island, we borrowed snorkeling equipment almost daily since the beach and Bay are so convenient, I took two aerial yoga classes that were amazing (I'd never tried it before and now I'm hooked!), and we booked a snorkel-sail that ended up being a once-in-a-lifetime experience.    The Four Seasons contracts with a local company that operates two catamarans for snorkel sails, sunset cruises, and whale watches. We opted for the snorkel sail and were lucky enough to be the only ones on the boat because the other guests no-showed. The boat is freaking amazing (used to be a chase boat for the America's Cup), very luxurious, and our crew (Captain Kama, Trey, and Junior) were extremely friendly and professional. They obviously love their job and are great at it.    The snorkel sail starts with a 45-min cruise to the beautiful cliffs on the other side of Lana'i, then you have about 60-90 minutes at a great snorkeling spot before sailing back to the resort while the crew serves a lunch of fruit, sandwiches, and snacks.    During our sail out, the boat was surrounded by dozens of spotted dolphins. I counted six different pods of dolphins, all within a couple hundred feet of us, and many of the dolphins were racing right next to us! It was like that scene in the beginning of Titanic. It turns out spotted dolphins can jump 20 feet (!) into the air and they're very playful so they were just racing the catamaran and jumping for joy all around us. I've never seen anything like it, and was so delighted and exhilarated that I was jumping and yelling like a little kid.    I've never written a TripAdvisor review before, and certainly didn't intend for this review to be so darn long, but I enjoyed myself so thoroughly at the Four Seasons Lana'i that I've been daydreaming about it ever since I left.

569777703,50,Beautiful Restoration of an Amazing Resort,"I actually worked at the Manele Bay Resort, for about 25 years, starting with it's opening in 1991. It was great to, recently, spend a few nights at the resort on a business trip. First of all, it must be clearly understood that this is not a place for the budget minded traveler... as a matter of fact, if you even need to ask about the pricing... this is, probably not the resort for you. You will pay a premium, for everything here, at the very top tier of Hawaii resorts. What you get for your money, is a resort experience like none other in Hawaii. The resort owner, Larry Ellison, is sparing no expense to turn the Manele Bay Resort into a resort like no other... anywhere. Service is amazing... from the time you set foot on property, to the time that you leave. I know just about every employee at the resort, and I know how hard they try to blend a world class experience with local charm. Everywhere I went, I was greeted with warm and genuine smiles. I have been very impressed with how the current management is focusing on Hawaiian culture... from the decor, to the story tellers and artisans... there is no doubt that you are in Hawaii. For several of my years at the resort, I tried very hard to develop hikes and tours that really focused on Lana'i history and culture... I was very glad to see that this is now a real focus point of the activity offerings. The resort is both stunning and immaculate... it's really difficult to find fault with much of anything. For me, however, the real charm of Lana'i comes from it's incredible pristine beauty. I encourage anyone who visits here to take full advantage of the outdoor activities... such as boating, hikes, horse back rides, and UTV excursions. Lana'i has some of the last ""untouched"" places in Hawaii... like Kaunolu (the old Hawaiian village where King Kamehameha I once resided). Other places like the historic church house at Keomoku... invite visitors to explore the Hawaii of days gone by. Some of my fondest memories, of Lana'i, will always be the time I spent hiking and exploring the beautiful and remote places of this peaceful island. If you, truly, want to ""get away from it all""... the Island of Lana'i is the place to go. I am including an aerial photo of one of my favorite places on Lana'i... Pu'upehe (Sweetheart Rock).

563274503,50,Ethereal - Lānaʻi is Magical!,"The Manele Bay Four Seasons is truly incredible - the lodging & amenities of Big Island’s Hualalai Resort with the gorgeous crescent beach of Mauna Kea, yet no crowds! Our family of 5 has always loved Hawaii and gotten comfortable with the fabulous Fairmont Kea Lani on Maui for the past decade. This Feb break, we opted to visit Lānaʻi and Manele Bay for the first half of the week, transferring through Honolulu to Lānaʻi’s tiny airport. The added transfer time was made bearable by the special Four Seasons lounge at HNL airport. The reward was landing via prop plane on rustic Lānaʻi, a 140 sq mile island populated by just over 3,000 residents (You can also travel by Ferry to/from Lahaina in less than an hour). There are no traffic lights on the island so none of the traffic that increasingly infects Maui. Yet, the Four Seasons Manele Bay Resort has been gorgeously renovated at the direction of Billionaire Larry Ellison, who has spared no expense making this a flagship Four Seasons property. In fact post-renovation, the number of rooms actually decreased by 24% from 286 to 217. The huge upside of this is that you never have to fight for beach chairs, pool side seats or restaurant reservations - it feels just like a private enclave, because it is. Nobu is a tough reservation in Palo Alto or NYC, but here it is the in-house restaurant, available for dinner any night. The beach is spectacular and short walk to Sweetheart Rock and the lava cliffs. All the activities, like clay shooting, archery and UTV tours are vertically integrated into the Four Seasons Resort - again, there aren’t any other major resorts on the Island. The net result of this is one of the finest resorts anywhere dropped onto one of the least populated tropical islands in the world - what could be better?

We booked the “Love Lanai” package and it was well worth it. If your active this is a great choice. We were able to take the UTV ride, SCUBA dive, and play golf every day under the package, and there is a lot more activities to choose. We had booked 6 nights, however, an incoming storm caused us to ask about departing a day early to Honolulu so we wouldn’t miss our flight home. The hotel was very gracious in not only not charging us for the last night but letting us stay in our room until 2pm the day we departed. They also arranged for the flight back to Honolulu, which leads me to a couple of suggestions. The private Lanai Air flight to and from HNL is only $500 for the entire plane. Well worth it and comes and goes when you need it. Just book in advance. Our only issue with the stay is if you’re there for an extended period of time it would be nice to have more than 3 dining options for dinner. Eating at the same restaurants every meal for 6 days gets a bit old, but the food is great. Service throughout the hotel was also excellent.

Larry Ellison has done a tremendous job over hauling the resort: the landscaping is magnificent. The restaurants are top notch, the decor beautiful. Mother nature has provided a gorgeous backdrop!

Resort Assistant Manager Leigh once again took personal interest in making our visit special--she helped us understand what the true Spirit of Aloha is by her actions. Once again, Uncle Bruno and his rescue parrots were a pleasure to experience.  We timed this visit to occur during the whale watching season and Leigh made a reservation for us to go on a ""WHALE WATCH EXPEDITION"" offered by Lana'i Ocean Sports. The resort furnished a round trip shuttle to and from Manele Harbor, where we boarded a 49' Sloop Rigged Sailing Catamaran for a two hour whale watch(the catamaran can hold 49 passengers but we had only 13 passengers). We saw numerous whales and received an education about whales from the captain.

We tried all of the restaurants at the resort at least once, room service for breakfast a couple of times and you can’t go wrong with either. Room service was superior and the attendant turned on romantic music for us, as we dined outside on our balcony. There’s lots to do on the property and it’s a short walk to Hulopo’e Beach, one of the worlds most perfect stretches of sand. I would definitely recommend taking the short hike to see Sweetheart Rick from Hulopo’e Beach. We also went downtown to the shops, picked up a few pieces of art from Mike Carroll Gallery. We went Blue Ginger restaurant, downtown a few times and Lanai City Service which is a gas station with great deli sandwiches. if you’re up for an adventure you’ll need to rent a Jeep to get to the secluded beach, Polihua Beach. It was absolutely gorgeous and worth the 4 miles of driving in the rough terrain to get there. Of course you’re advised not to go because of the rough terrain and heavy current of Polihua Beach.

But we got this for the entire visit which has a closet with racks at the belly button level and a shower meant for folks with disabilities ~ not exactly fantastic for healthy active couples.

We have been to the four seasons at the big island and the one at Maui. All of these are awesome, but all different.

Staff attitude and customer service at the hotel were inconsistent--a few of the staff were truly excellent, but most were average and a few were mediocre. Effort was definitely there for some, but unfortunately for some of the others I did not get the sense that there was an interest in helping the guests. Beach service was barely there--and there were virtually no guests at the beach to reflect this. The staff at the upcountry portion of the resort (UTV rides, horseback ranch, archery and clay shooting) as well as the dive staff were excellent and really made the stay exceptional for us.

The beach is fantastic and never crowded, pool-side is great, although the pools are a bit small, restaurants and bars--although expensive--provide good value. Service levels are over-the-top.    The property is designed in such a way that it never feels crowded or busy. During my stay I never waited for anything, always had a beach or pool chair available for the asking. Tours and activities were well-planned and provided exceptional value. I especially appreciated the hotel's policy of not cancelling or consolidating activities depending on demand. The snorkel boat goes whether they have one passenger or a full boat.

557434809,50,Paradise Found!,"My family and I recently stayed five nights in a Prime Oceanfront room. This resort pretty much checked every box off for what we look for in a dream vacation. Let's start with check-in. I appreciated the fact that when you arrive there is no waiting in line to check in you are greeted at the door with a refreshment and immediately escorted to your room, and any questions get answered and if there is any paperwork to sign it's done in the comfort of your room. Another thoughtful gesture is instead of carrying around your key card everywhere you get an electronic bracelet to access your room. So in a matter of 10 minutes, you could feel that we are in a next level resort and every detail is considered. Our room was beautiful and spacious very modern, and the view was spectacular an unobstructed view of just the gorgeous ocean.    The grounds are just beyond gorgeous I seriously felt like we are on a movie set and was just waiting for someone to yell CUT. The foliage, the flowers the ocean view the butterflies everywhere just amazing and honestly, we have travelled around the world and stayed at some beautiful luxury resorts this was seriously next level.    The beach was a maybe 5-minute trek from the resort but once you arrive your immediately escorted to chairs that the staff set up and the beach is just breathtaking. I do wish that they had bar service at the beach, but I believe it's a bylaw that they can't serve alcohol on the beach minuscule price to pay for such a beautiful view and total relaxation.    Since my daughter was so happy with the included Kids For All Seasons program. She sincerely wanted nothing to do with us; you would think kids camp was her job she couldn't be late. Yay for us we spent most afternoons at the adult pool, and even though the pool area felt small, I was surprised with the fact, finding seating was no problem, and the service at the pool was perfection.    For dining, we enjoyed Malibu farms during the day, and one forty was terrific for dinner. As far as Nobu goes I just don't get it we have dined at Nobu previously in the Bahamas and Vegas, and it's like I'm trying to understand why are we paying such insane prices for such little food. In Lanai because food apparently has to be transported to the Island. I feel the price was even more inflated and to be honest maybe I'm spoiled but I preferred the sushi at my local place in Vancouver Canada, and I would pay 1/10th the price as Nobu, and I wouldn't feel like going through a drive-through after.    Well after this long essay all I have left to say is after 20 plus years of luxury resort travelling this is the first time that upon having to leave this resort I felt like I reverted to a five-year-old. I wanted to stomp my feet and cross my arms and say I'm not going anywhere. My husband had to promise me that we will come back soon. Within a week of arriving home, I already booked us to go back for my birthday in May. I would like to note that we are an older couple and have travelled extensively and considering when we are at home it is non stop busy so when we do travel we sincerely want to do absolutely nothing so this resort might not appeal to you if you want nightlife and lots of excursions.",Jan 2018,January 2018,Traveled with family,Prime Ocean Front Room Was Amazing Zero Obstruction Of The View Of Ocean,"Vancouver, Canada"

There's not much to do on Lanai but the excursions the hotel offered were well organized and interesting (we did snorkeling, whale watching and a jeep rental).

This was our first stay at a Four Seasons Property so I cannot say if all are like this one. The hotel is stunning in its beauty. The rooms, grounds, pool areas etc, were magnificent. What made it so special however was the staff. Without exception, each person that we met offered exemplary service. The restaurants for the most part were also exceptional. The food was so flavorful and varied. What a treat to eat in them. The private dinner that we had will be remembered for a lifetime. The view restaurant at the golf course is a must visit. This place was so memorable, was there anything not perfect? Well yes. The breakfast at the Sports Bar was average at best and the prices for food like oatmeal ($16) was just a money grab. The other breakfast option was sensational, but it was pricey and too much food for us. The buffet was one of the best for those that love tons of food. Also, the beach was just ok. It was a long walk from the property and the drop off in the water was severe, especially for children. There was a safer area to swim for those that can't swim or are not strong swimmers.

After a year of planning we had 6 weeks to find a replacement for early November 2017. We have always thought of going to FS Lanai and luckily they had availability for an Ocean Front Room. From the drive from the airport to the resort with the road lined with Cook Pine trees I knew this would be a special stay. There is so much undeveloped land and feeling of space and beauty. Our room was wonderful - from our deck we could see no other room - only the ocean! The gardens throughout the resort are so lushl. We are beach people, not pools people, and the beach was awesome. We enjoyed many swims, lots of walks, and just relaxing while lounging on the comfy chaises and watching the beautiful ocean. Walking up to Sweetheart Rock one early morning to watch the sunrise was so special. The restaurants were all stellar - loved Nobu: the sushi bar, restaurant and bar and so enjoyed One Forty for dinners. We had one lunch at the golf Sports Bar and what a view! The breakfast was incredible! We are not breakfast people but included in our package. Oh the offerings on the buffet were amazing! Loved all the sushi and Japanese breakfast and those poached eggs with smoked salmon addicting. Everyone at the resort was so friendly and helpful. After one visit to the beach or restaurant the staff knew our names and what we liked. We appreciated how the resort had complimentary shuttle to town and airport. One other nice tough was that the FS has it own lounge at HNL where you could get a nice cold beverage and snack and check in so when you arrived at the resort you were immediately taken to your room. We have stayed at FS Hualaiai and Maui several times. The only reason we have not gone to Lanai is that it requires an extra flight from HN. After doing this little flight no issue at all.

Everything in this hotel was absolutely decadent luxury, from the impeccably detailed rooms to a layout and landscaping that could not have been more beautiful. NOTE: The ""Garden View Room"" should be renamed ""Mind Blowing Tropical Rain Forest Experience Room."" We were shocked at how luxurious all of their rooms are, including the more affordable Garden View room which made us feel like we were in the canopy of a secluded and untouched tropical forest overlooking a winding waterfall feature. All of their rooms are incredible and worth every penny. This resort sounds large with over 200 rooms, but staying there feels like there are only 20 rooms because every area is so intimate. I got to know several people there and it was nice seeing them again at places like dinner or on the beach. The four luxury restaurants at 4S means you never feel crowded as the guests are leisurely spread out among them. The layout of the hotel makes the rooms also feel private as the buildings weave through the hills and the tropical foliage all connected by the majestic lobby/ lounge, and lanai. Their breakfast buffet is.... beyond compare. They have an awesome selection of activities which can keep you active and thrilled every minute if you want! Incredible hikes along the dramatic cliff shores. Horseback riding geared for every level exploring an incredible landscape and vistas; I signed up for a private ride and was rewarded with the most enjoyable and customized technical western riding lessons that I've even had in my life.

There is a great morning buffet with freedom to order a large quantity of items off the menu (which are included in the price) and then there is the incomparable Nobu for the evening meal... it doesn't get any better. On the golf course one beautiful and picturesque hole follows another- what a treat. For me, a true luxury vacation means no planning or commitments and you can show up at the pool or beach anytime and they will accommodate you- no fighting for lounge chairs here.... Also, there is an adults only pool which I have learned the hard way is important if you want to relax without kids screaming and splashing. The design detail is really outstanding. I couldn't quit admiring our room, where nothing was overlooked. Each item looked as it it had been carefully chosen and placed with a good eye. We stayed in room 1212 and I would recommend it as it has a wrap around balcony so you can catch both the sunrise and sunset- another true luxury.",Jan 2018,January 2018,Traveled as a couple,,"Toronto, Canada"
554077114,30,Best not to go over Christmas or New Year’s Eve,"One Forty restaurant was not good enough for the prices they ask, especially for New Year’s Eve. Nobu was excellent and worth the price. Malibu Grill was just average.    Additionally, the ambassadors at the concierge desk were so overwhelmed when we got there that none of our reservations got put into the system correctly. In fact, on the second day, an ambassador told me that she would call me back regarding a dinner reservation at Nobu but never called back. We ended up not being able to have dinner that evening at the restaurant (or in the hotel) and had to go to town. We understand that the hotel was very busy over the new year, but these mishaps should not happen at a Four Seasons. Our stay ended well once most of the families left, but we left the hotel underwhelmed, especially for the price we had to pay for our room ($1,700/night) for 8 nights.",Jan 2018,December 2017,Traveled as a couple,,"Old Greenwich, Connecticut"

553833481,40,"Go for the gorgeous 5 star property, brace yourself for 4 star management","The redone Four Seasons Lanai is gorgeous. The rooms might be my favorite hotel rooms anywhere. The common areas are beautiful, restaurants are stunning. No expense was spared. The island is natural Hawaiian beauty at it's finest, not yet molested by development and tourism. It's not cheap, but it's definitely worth the cost.    We travel between 75-100 days a year, all 5 star where possible. I find this property intriguing because Larry Ellison has clearly spared no expense to build a 5 star property. But despite all that spending, the front desk staff and the management deliver a solid 4 star experience. I always marvel when business get the expensive stuff right(the renovation) and then misfire on the stuff that they could get right without spending more. For example, I could fix the front desk/ management problem quickly. They clearly need a new front desk / front of house manager. How do I know this? Because the restaurant and the pool service is 5 star. But the front desk experience is a disaster (see details below).    Practical advice you can use:  1. Confirm, confirm, confirm. Get everything in writing. Make restaurant reservations on Opentable. I've never had so much trouble with reservations/arrangements at a hotel. Our initial itinerary showed none of the spa appointments that we'd made months before. Then after I had confirmed them with the front desk AND walked down to the spa to confirm, Jaron at the front desk ""accidentally"" canceled the massage appointment that we'd booked a month earlier. So much for our 20th anniversary couples massage. They comped the massage but who cares?  2.When booking spa appointments, ask how long the technician has been with the property and if they are their temporarily. My husband had the worst massage of his life with a technician who was only there for the festive season.  3. Do a cooking lesson. Expensive but amazing.  4. Sit down for this one. Nobu is boring and seems like a halfhearted implementation. Not his best work. One FORTY is amazing. Young chef Kemar Durfield is amazing. This guy is going places. I told him I expected it to be called Kemar's next time I was back. He would be amazing with his own place. Watch this guy.  *Not kidding. We LOVE sushi and don't eat much steak, but would choose One Forty over Nobu anyday.  5. Eat at Views. Service is SLOW. View is amazing  6. Rent a Jeep. Go to Valley of the Gods. And Shipwreck. Drive all the way to Polihua takes hours. We've done it before, but we stopped at Valley of the gods this time.Gorgeous    FS Lanai vs Hualalai....  We spent time at both this year. Things to think about.  1. We were there at the festive season. BC of all the houses, villas, condos at Hualalai, the pools, restaurants, golf course are SO crowded in Dec. Not so in Lanai. Even though the hotel was full, their were always chairs available at the pool and beach. You did NOT have to get up to reserve chairs.  2. The restaurant (quality and variety) were just as good at FSLanai despite less guests. Doesn't seem like they could possibly be breaking even (but that's Uncle Larry's problem). No wait for any restaurants at any time, day or night. Compare this to Hualalai where you have to book in October and guests are frequently turned away from restaurants.  3. Shops are less interesting / smaller at Lanai, prob due to smaller census.  4. True of both hotels in Dec. SO MANY LiTTLE KIDS. I remember FS Manele Bay being a grown up place. Not anymore. Not in Dec.    All in, I would choose FS Lanai, although it's definitely less of a see and be seen scene than Hualalai. Depends what you like.    ***To elaborate, every interaction with the Front Desk was disappointing. For example:  1. Descriptions of activities given by front desk staff conflict with those on the in room iPad (iPad says ""drive your own UTV"". Front desk staff says you can't drive.). This is SO SIMPLE. This is poor management. Update the iPads, train the staff.  2. Front desk staff can never answer any question without asking someone else, running back into an office. This may be related to temporary staff for festive season. Get rid of temp staff if you can't bring in better temps. Temp staff at Malibu (pool restaurant) was the manager from the Malibu restaurant in CA. He was amazing. That's a good temp.  3. Jaron, at the front desk, was temporary festive staff. He was rude, condescending, unlike any 4Seasons staff anywhere in the world. He couldn't figure out how to operate the computer and had to keep asking a colleague who wasn't busy but wouldn't just let her help us. We asked what time our massage was and whether it would conflict with another activity. We later discovered that he accidentally canceled the massage.  4. I asked at the Front desk, several times, for someone from management to call me regarding my experience with Jaron. No one ever reached out to me.  5.

The hotel and its well-trained staff never missed a beat even during the super busy Festive Season. They even go to the trouble of flying in reinforcements from Nobu and Malibu Farm in LA to create an experience that is no different than you would find back at home. How they were able to remember the guests names, preferences is quite remarkable. Every detail of this hotel was well run. After 10 days at the resort, we literally have no constructive commentary on how they could improve. To be sure, this comes at a price. You are getting top notch service along with a remote island location. Beyond the Four Seasons, the island itself is an extension of the hotel.

548125247,50,"Simply unparalleled. We need more bubbles, because this is beyond ""5"".","I work in hospitality, and have my entire life. I've run out of superlatives, and cannot wait to return. Ellison buying the Island may be a ""so far so good"" moment for the residents, but it's obvious he's tailoring true hospitality to your destination experience. Limiting the amount of outside interference so that the guests are truly catered to, and allowing occupancy to not become too overwhelming such that the intimacy of the experience isn't jeopardized by the desire for a stronger bottom line on a profit loss statement... it's just glorious, and so rare. Hearing how he has helped rebuild some of the community is also heartening, but it's truly Lanai's people are what make it such a singular experience. Maui is full of great hospitality professionals, but I had not experienced such honest Aloha in my 35 years of visiting that island. We used to visit Hana, but I can't imagine a more Ohana-type of vibe and experience than what is happening in Lanai.    Your in room tech is seamless, and where most technology is disruptive, I admit I was overly impressed with your integration into the PMS, and the simplicity of the controls. The RFID key bracelet was particularly simple, forgoing the silliness of some ""app"" to open the door with a smartphone, we appreciate how you only use technology for ease of hospitality, and not for gimmick or to remove the human element from the experience.    Your staff at both the pool and beach were amazing, and charming. Your hotel restaurant was superb, and we had some of the best seafood ever. But the fact Ellison got Nobu is just surreal, and we have completely destroyed our ability to enjoy fresh fish on the mainland. We truly had some of the greatest dining of our life. Your room service was also delightful.    Rick Lane, your F&B manager was AMAZING, and Shaw Cote from your spa was incredible. Truly dedicated and experience luxury hotel pros. It was wonderful speaking with them, and learning more about your property. I cannot remember all the other people's names, but I will come back to make sure and remember, next time. Even the bad weather's rain and wind couldn't dampen our spirits for one single day.    You are executing at a level of hospitality that no one in the world is accomplishing, and it's likely because of a more philanthropic and ""slow"" approach to operations than the majority of management groups are used to. The opportunity to create a serene and calming experience for your guests is unparalleled, and I cannot wait to speak to more people about all that you achieve.    Thank you Thank you Thank you.

544534802,50,"Perfection, at a price!","Having stayed at this property a number of times, I’ve been fortunate enough to witness the transformation from an often overlooked, and quirky, resort on one of the quietest islands to a first class resort.    Visiting Lana’i requires an extra trip; either a 30-minute flight from Oahu, or a 45-minute ferry ride from Lahaina, on Maui. However, at the right time of year, you’re likely to see whales on the way over. The hotel is about 25-minutes from the airfield (small planes only), or 5-minutes from the harbor.    The views over the Pacific, as you enter the hotel, are amazing, and keep getting better. I’d recommend either an Ocean or Partial Ocean View room, so that you can sit out on the balcony to watch either the sunrise, sunset, or both.    Rooms and bathrooms are wonderful, especially the toilets that raise and lower the lid on their own, flush automatically, gently illuminate the bathroom and even warm the seat for you!    Food was great everywhere we ate on property, but it didn’t come cheap. The amazing breakfast buffet at One Forty will set you back $52++! Given the quality and diversity of what was available, I didn’t mind that as much as the $28 hamburger in the Sportsbar. The Ahi Poke Burger was amazing. Didn’t eat at Nobu this time around.    There are activities galore. The beach staff are attentive and knowledgeable and ready to provide you with complementary snorkeling equipment and advice, so that you can enjoy some of the best snorkeling anywhere. The price you pay for amazingly clear water and a diverse array of fish is that there aren’t many Turtles, especially compared to Maui.    My son and I did a 2-tank dive and explored the Cathedrals - if you’re into diving, this is a must. For those that prefer to stay on land, there’s golf, sporting clays, horseback riding, archery, and UTVs (albeit governed).    The recently renovated spa is first class, and the newly landscaped pools are great. Even if the pools get busy, the beach rarely does.

543631670,50,The best!,"The Four Seasons Lanai is simply the best US hotel we have ever visited! We went as a family of three couples and a baby and all LOVED FS Lana’i! We have been to several resorts on other islands and this hotel is absolutely head and shoulders above them all! The combination of the gorgeous facility, grounds, seclusion (essentially the only hotel on the island!), staff and management contribute to my thinking it’s the best hotel I’ve visited in the US. It’s a little hard to get to, but once we were all there, it was great! From the GM, Alastair McAlpine, to the entire staff, everyone was warm, welcoming, and couldn’t do enough to make us happy.    Having a baby along can be complicated, but FS generally, and this hotel in particular, completely catered to him. In FS style, they provided a “pack and play” at the pool, crib and high chair in our suite, along with swim diapers, wipes and baby toiletries.    Special shout outs to Samantha in Guest Services whom we worked with prior to and throughout our week-long stay, to Helen in Housekeeping, Francis at breakfast, Matt at Malibu Farms restaurant, to the Beach Boys, Jay, Bryan, Chris & Josh, to Casey at the golf course, we were incredibly well-taken care of. Most impressive was that nearly all staff members greeted me by name - and there are 200 guest rooms!    We took advantage of the “Love Lanai” package, a daily per-person fee that allowed us to take advantage of a large array of activities. It was especially great to have unlimited golf included, as greens fees are otherwise quite pricy and the golf course is not to be missed. All holes offer gorgeous ocean views with a couple of over-water par 3s that are simply breath-taking. That we could play a little every day was fabulous, and the course was empty in the afternoons.    Since I am an avid stand up paddler, I wanted to be able to SUP in the gorgeous bay, but beacause it’s a protected marine preserve, the hotel isn’t allowed to provide boards (though they do give out snorkling gear - and the snorkeling is excellent). I was able to rent a board for the week from Nick Palumbo of Surfing Lanai and that was great. He delivers boards and makes it a very easy transaction.    The hotel recently underwent a multi-million dollar facelift and they missed nothing - finishes and furnishings are top of the line - contemporary and beautiful, yet very relaxed.    Food good to excellent, with the breakfast buffet one of the best around. Also notable was Nobu (our beautifully served Thanksgiving dinner via room service on our ocean front patio). We also really enjoyed lunches around the pool from Malibu Farms.    Mr. McAlpine is an extremely hands on manager and takes incredible pride in this hotel, given that he originally opened it and now has returned after some years away at other FS properties. His special care is everywhere - as he seemed to be - making sure that everything was perfect and that we were happy. Very impressive - and seldom seen, in my experience.    I could go on and on, but truly, this is an incredible property, with an outstanding staff. In this case - you do get what you pay for! There’s only ONE thing I would change and that’s to institute a no-tipping policy. Although there isn’t a mandate to tip, and staff absolutely do not seem to be expecting tips, to me it’s a distasteful aspect of a vacation - especially one this pricy.

540461096,40,Would have been 5 star if just 3 things were different. AMAZING resort!,"This was my 6th time to The Four Seasons Lanai, having first gone many years ago when it was under different ownership. Everything about our experience this time around was 5 star and perfect other than 3 things:    The major item was that we got married here only a few years ago and spent A LOT of money, as you might imagine. We hosted 75 wedding guests, had both the wedding and the rehearsal dinner and a bridesmaid brunch here. Plus, a scouting trip for the wedding AND an anniversary trip a year after our wedding. So, that's 3 trips in a row VERY recently. One would think that when we checked in that they MIGHT remember us? But no. The staff who greeted us, I believe her name was Myra or Myrna, didn't seem to know we'd ever been there before and started touring us & then led us to one of the worst rooms in the resort. We had a partial ocean room reserved and when we were taken to it, it was basically the worst room in that category (I know the hotel VERY well having scouted extensively for our wedding), way in the far bottom dark corner of building 3. Essentially not a partial ocean view and very dark. Basically the last room in the partial ocean category before one is in the garden view category. When we expressed our disappointment, we were told there was a big group coming in and due to the dates of our trip we could not be changed, although we could pay for an upgrade. Really? The hotel was NOT full. In fact, it was less crowded than it's EVER been in the 6 times I've been there!!!!! And yet, there wasn't an automatic ""Please let us show you a different room""? I had to spend 20 minutes in the room fighting for a different room and actually had to resort to mentioning that we spent a ton of money on a big wedding etc. I felt very uncomfortable having to do that!!! One would think we would be in the system and as very good repeat customers would be treated accordingly. Not a great way to start the trip. And it took an hour+ of our precious time (we were only at the resort for 4 nights). Really upsetting.  In the end we were very happy with our room in building 6, even though as a partial ocean view we actually couldn't see the ocean. But it took approx 1 hour of our check-in time to get us there. We didn't feel like honored guests.    Second complaint: One Forty, one of the two dinner restaurant choices, was not up to snuff. The scallops my husband ordered were either over-cooked or not fresh, were weren't sure which. They forgot to bring the cheese that was part of his salad and when we requested it, they brought him a different kind of cheese. When he complained they apologized for mixing him up with another guest. But they did not comp the salad or do anything to make up for the mistake as we felt they should have. And my fish entree was so/so. Not great. We cancelled our second dinner reservation there as it was a disappointment. For breakfast One Forty is VERY VERY GOOD! So this is only a criticism for dinners there. We, as well as many other hotel guests we spoke with, wished that Malibu Farm or Views had been open for dinner, because our only options were Nobu (which was excellent) or the Sports Bar which was not our ideal environment with TVs on and no outside seating. Needless to say, we ate a lot of Japanese food! And had hoped for more Hawaiian meals.    3rd complaint: My husband and I have different last names, as I kept my maiden name. We made it VERY clear before we arrived, in 2 emails and in 1 phone call, that I was to be called by my last name and that my husband was to be called by his. I repeatedly corrected this in emails leading up to our trip. Yet throughout the trip staff CONSTANTLY called my husband by MY last name or called me by his. One would think in this modern age that this would not be difficult. By the 3rd day we gave up trying to correct them.    On the positive, this is still our favorite resort in all of Hawaii, and that's saying a lot considering we've been to every single island, including Molokai, and every Four Seasons in Hawaii. We have stayed in 24 or 25 other hotels in Hawaii.  Because of our wedding, and even before that, this resort has a VERY special place in our hearts and will always feel like ""our place"".    The beach is unbeatable.  The gardens are stunning.  The new rooms are gorgeous.  The staff, other than our check-in person previously mentioned, is excellent.  The spa services are blissful.  The new pools are enchanting.  The luau grounds are magical.  The airport shuttle driver was delightful.  The Manele Bay Harbor (we ferried in from Maui) shuttle driver knew our names immediately and actually was one of the only staff members who got our names right.  And we can't wait for the Wellness Spa to open up in place of The Lodge next year, as we really missed being about to go up to another resort for dinners, etc.    Maybe next time we will be in the system as great repeat customers/honored guests? This would be nice.",Nov 2017,November 2017,,,"San Francisco, California"

The two pools are nice and well landscaped, and there are plenty of locations around the pool that you can relax and stare out toward the ocean. The activities offered through the hotel are great: We went out on the catamaran TWICE and went clay pigeon shooting. We had a great fun with each excursion.

539563196,50,Possibly the best Four Seasons Resort in North America,"For a more detailed review and video of the suite I stayed in, you can check out my profile.    While I have not been to every single Four Seasons out there, but I have been to quite a few around the world. Four Seasons to me, stands for high quality service and nice interior. Because Four Seasons own very few of their properties, each property has its own look and quality depending on owner's objective. Some Four Seasons looks like a slightly nicer version of a Westin Hotel such as Four Seasons Palo Alto. Some Four Seasons look beautiful like the Four Seasons Bora Bora. And then there is the Four Seasons on Lana'i; it is one of those exceptional Four Seasons that warrants repeat visits.    As many of you may know, Four Seasons Lana'i is own by Larry Ellison. What this means is he has oodles of money to spend on sprucing up Lana'i if he wants to and thankfully for me, he did. In general, Four Seasons lobbies are very grand. They are very good at setting the tone of luxury. However, when you step into your room, let's just say sometimes it can be a let down. Again, I would refer this back to Palo Alto Four Seasons (let me beat this dead horse again). Lana'i Four Seasons' finishes is unparalleled to any other Four Seasons I've been to.    I was lucky to stay at their Alii Royal Suite and I honestly did not want to leave. This suite is basically Four Seasons Lana'i's highest category suite.... even higher than their presidential suite. Alii Royal suite can be either one bedroom or two (connecting room next door can be made available). I have stayed at places that have similar level of opulence such as Cheval Blanc Randheli or the Brando in Tahiti. But the amount of space and custom details made my stay at Four Seasons Lana'i the most opulent hotel suite I had the pleasure to stay in. Everything about the suite is gorgeous; from the beautiful handmade Nepalese Lokta wallpaper to gorgeous museum worthy artwork on walls. My favorite is the Dietrich Varez wallpaper in the closet anteroom. A steam bath is incorporated into a large two person shower room. Oh and did I mention there is a two person Japanese tub in the bathroom as well? And of course let's not forget about the amazing ocean front view off the living room, dining room, media room, and master bedroom. The suite also comes with a library but I didn't spend any time in there as I was too busy looking out the window. Just in case you don't want to look at TV in your master bedroom, they mounted a hidden TV in the ceiling above your bed so you don't have to look at it unless you want to.    While I can stay in Alii Royal suite and never leave, I did leave so I can enjoy rest of the resort. There are few restaurants onsite. I really liked Malibu Farm which came from Los Angeles. Food is very fresh and tasty. The Sports Bar and Grill has yummy salad and their poke bowl uses freshest tuna. It was divine. Nobu is always good... I wish it was Matsuhisa though which I like better. The weakest link for me was One Forty. The food was typical Four Seasons good. It's competent food but not something to write home about.    Another thing I enjoyed about staying at a resort is experiencing their spa. So naturally I have to hit up the one here. Funny thing is they use exact same lockers as the ones at Four Seasons Bora Bora. But I would say the spa is prettier here at Lana'i. The one at Bora Bora is more rustic looking which it makes sense but personally I prefer a more luxe tailored looking spa. There is the typical lockers, shower stalls, steam room, sauna room, and waiting area. All very nicely furnished. The spa room was adequately sized and my masseur was good. One thing spa manager did which I really appreciate was he moved my masseur's meeting around to accommodate me. I thought that was very consumer-centric move. He could have easily left my original reservation time and I would had to come back later at a less optimal time for me. So bravo to the manager at the spa. And he is not the only one who went out of his way to make me feel cared for. But more on that later.    Spa facility is actually very close to the hotel pools. This resort has two pools. One is family pool and the other one is adult pool. They are not that far apart from each other but I suppose some foliage, walkway, and palm trees between them do serve some kind of separation. For me though, I much rather go to a beach than jump into a pool. Lana'i Four Seasons has a nice beach very close to the resort. All Hawaiian beaches are public so we did run into several local people next to the Four Seasons beach. However, because the population on Lanai is small, there isn't that many people on the beach so it felt fairly private. If you are looking to snorkel, you have to go to the side that's farther away from the resort. It's a five minute walk so you don't have to trek very far. The snorkeling experience was good. There were plenty of colorful fish and creatures in the water.    If you are a gym junkie, then you are in luck as this resort has a very nice large gym. It has free weights and assisted weight machines. It's a proper gym which one normally don't get in a resort no matter how luxe the resort is. Most places have an onsite gym as an afterthought. This gym not only offer you lots of equipment, it even has free earphones in case you don't have one when you hop onto a cardio machine! Now that's a first. Oh, and it does have a very nice ocean view while you do your cardio to boot.    Lastly, the staff at Four Seasons Lanai was incredible. The best Four Seasons Service I've experience was at Four Seasons Koh Samui. That resort has 60 villas with 11 private residence rentals. Lanai Four Seasons has a total of 213 rooms and I have to say they give the staff at Koh Samui a run for their money. Everyone from resort manager David to beach boy was super nice and incredibly they all remember my name!! It's one thing I'm at an Aman resort (which has 35 rooms or less) and people remembers me but it's another when the staff at the beach here asked me about how was my dinner last night at Lanai City Bar and Grill (a local restaurant in town) when I know the only other staff that know I went was the ambassador/ concierge at the front entrance. It goes to show that every department in the hotel communicates with each other and they want to make sure you are absolutely taken care of down to the littlest details. I'm impressed. I don't know how they do it with so many rooms. There is a saying that one of the best thing about being in Hawaii is the Ohana spirit that one comes across while in Hawaii. I have to say Four Seasons Lana'i embraced that concept and then some. This Four Seasons is the best Hawaiian Four Seasons bar none.",Nov 2017,October 2017,Traveled as a couple,,san francisco
539544044,50,True luxury on a remote island just off the coast of Maui,"For our 28th anniversary, I took my wife back to the Four Seasons Resort Lana'i. Last time we were there was about 15 years ago, when it was owned by Murdoch/Dole. It was (and is) beautiful, but since it has been purchased by Larry Ellison, after a major remodel the whole resort has been extensively re-imagined, upgraded and made even more beautiful and luxurious. There are two ways to arrive at the resort. If you fly in through Oahu, you can relax in a private lounge at the airport exclusively for hotel guests, and then fly non-stop to the island. Must be nice. We flew in to Maui, and took a cab (an Escalade arranged by the hotel conceirge) from the airport to the Banyan tree in Lahaina, and then we took the boat to the island (about an hour plus or minus in the crossing). We were met at the dock, where they knew our names (everyone at the hotel knew who we were, and congratulated us on our anniversary).    At the hotel, our receptionist offered us an upgrade (not free) to one of the top suites at the resort, so we had a 5th-floor two room, two full bathroom 1,300+ sq feet ocean view suite - truly spectacular!    The landscaping, trees, flowers and vines in and around the hotel were breathtaking. The service was excellent. There are 3 main restaurants -- Nobu (not crowded, and no one tries to upsell every course), Malibu Farm (only open for lunch while we were there) and a steakhouse/seafood restaurant, plus a sports bar [which features free cocktails every evening and the best pool tables I have ever played on]. Coming from a town which also has both Nobu and the first Malibu Farm, we were familiar with the menus, and the service and food were delightful.    We played golf at Manele Bay two days - a Jack Nicklaus course with spectacular views -- hung out on the beach, worked out in the gymn, and spent a lot of time alone.    So it is a high end, remote, and quiet (except for some wedding parties) resort. And unlike the other resorts that we have stayed at in Hawai;i, it isn't overly Hawaiian - no hula contests, little to no Hawaiian music, no shows, just an overall sense of calm and relaxation, even when you slice 4 to 8 golf balls onto lava, or down into the ocean off the cliffs. How can you be happy doing that? But you seem to be happy.",Nov 2017,October 2017,Traveled as a couple,Ask to see your room. Ours was 4577.

539426350,50,This is the place in Hawaii!,"We have stayed at each of the Four Seasons properties in Hawaii over the course of the years and this is by far, hands down, the best of the best! It is not as easy to get to, but the little bit of extra effort is worth it. We flew from LA to Honolulu and spent our layover in the Four Seasons lounge at the airport. The lovely ladies working that day checked us in to our room and helped us arrange a variety of activities for our stay. After the short flight over to Lanai we were greeted at the airport by a representative of the resort. He grabbed our luggage, loaded us into the shuttle and we arrived at the resort 30 minutes later. As we had already completed the check-in process, we proceeded directly to our room, an amazing suite that we had been upgraded to. The room was beautiful. Each and every detail was well thought out. The flat screen TVs are 75""! The toilet is a Toto electric toilet that does EVERYTHING for you! There is a lovely bay and the best snorkeling at a resort that we have experienced. The beach guys were wonderful. After meeting us the first time, they greeted us by name each day. The same with the staff at the pool. We loved our lunches at Malibu Farms where we got to know Matt, the manager, who is passionate about the restaurant, the resort and the island. We had a couple of wonderful lunches up at The Views by the golf course. For dinner there are two main options: Nobu and OneForty. We loved Nobu, but were not fans of OneForty. We like simply prepared foods and were hoping that would be the option at OneForty. There wasn't even a piece of seafood simply grilled on the menu. I am sure if we had asked the chef would have happily accommodated us. When I realized the Sports Bar served dinner I was thinking we would have simpler options there. Except for the hamburger, that menu was also a bit much for us. For me, the resort would have been perfection if either Malibu Farms or The Views were open for dinner. I do know why they are not, but those were the menus we liked the best.  The island is not a ""pretty"" island. The resort has created a number of activities to keep guests happy. We did the off-road vehicle tour and loved it.  Our favorite thing to do in Hawaii is relax, swim, eat and read. This was the perfect place for all of that.  The staff at all Four Season properties that we have visited are known for their professionalism and friendliness. But the people who work at this property went above and beyond. We can now stop ""checking out"" various Hawaii properties, we have found perfection and can't wait to return!

We also enjoyed the Discover Lanai package, highly recommended, with $200 credit that we used for neck and back massages by the pool. Really relaxing.  The only thing that could be better is the choices of food, we tried the sport bar witch had great servers and great food options, and also Nobu, that it was a little disappointing.

534224662,40,"Spectacular renovation, but the service has room for growth","We had a great stay overall. Ricky, Martin and Junior who took us out on the snorkel boat trip were fantastic. Gardens are spectacular and golf course is breathtaking. The exotic rescued birds and the koi add so much beauty, life and energy to the spaces. No detail was overlooked in designing the gorgeous common areas of the hotel. Loved the snorkel equipment available by the beach. Would be great to have some stand-up paddle boards available as well. The beach service was great; however, I saw one couple whose umbrella blew out into the ocean because of a gust of wind. When they waved for one of the beach staff to help, the staff person yelled that he couldn't help them because he did not have on swim trunks so the couple tried to get the umbrella out of the water by themselves. On some days, housekeeping neglected to do basic things like sweep floors and replenish certain sundries. Turndown service should include a piece of chocolate or some other treat. Our duvet cover initially had an old blood stain. Service was hit or miss: some staff were fantastic; others were just going through the motions. Really enjoyed the time we spent with Auntie Irene and Uncle Billy who taught us about their culture. Common areas in the women's spa needed attention (e.g., dirty water and dirt tracks from shoes on the floor, no water in the cracked wooden bucket in the sauna, no small towels or water battles in the ice bowl outside the steam room). I was in the women's spa naked in the steam room one hour before the spa's closing time and a man walked into the spa to clean it. *At no point during spa hours should male staff go into the women's spa area.* The spa receptionist who booked our couples massage never once smiled; she seemed apathetic and unenthusiastic. Spa overall was too small and would have been better if sauna was infrared. Near the end of our stay, we took a tour of the golf course with Kendrick who was wonderful. He told us about the Discover Lanai and Love Lanai packages. We were disappointed that we were not alerted about these options sooner since we would have loved to take advantage of one of the packages. When we went online to see these options, we also saw there was a fifth night free option that we would have also been great. We were in contact with the hotel a couple times after booking to arrange transportation and discuss different room options so at any point in our communications prior to arrival, we would have really appreciated it if someone we talked to had mentioned that there were these other packages that launched after we booked. When we tried to talk to someone about our reservation issue, we were referred to someone named Lovely. However, even after Eun connected us with Lovely over email and we also emailed Lovely, we never heard back from her. Two weeks went by and we finally contacted GM Alastair, who was able to connect us with another person named Emily.

533608773,50,THE ULTIMATE ESCAPE,"We are so fortunate to travel with regularity to luxury destinations. We spend six to eight weeks a year in Hawaii and this is our third trip to the Four Seasons Lanai since the renovation. I can sincerely say that there is nothing on the planet Earth that ticks all our boxes like this unbelievable resort and for many reasons. First and foremost the aesthetic beauty is unsurpassed. A simple walk to the elevator is an experience in tropical overload ! The guest experience is on another level...and in an intimate, natural and unforced way. I was so happy to be remembered on this stay by four different employees and greeted with warm embraces by them and our last stay was a year ago. This is certainly not something I need to have a great stay but the employees here go above and beyond to take care of their guests. The hotel room is absolutely stunning in it's luxury and yet it's simplicity and clean lines. We are always thrilled to return to our room after our day's activities. This stay we are in a corner ground floor ocean front prime room and I can lay in bed at night and gaze out at the ocean with the moonlight upon it and listen to the surf. It's simply paradise.    Beach staff, pool staff, restaurant staff, housekeeping, groundskeeping, valets, shuttle drivers, they are all wonderful. Everywhere you look is natural tropical beauty. The fresh flowers in the room, fabulous Aina toiletries, fantastic lanai furniture, the cloudllike beds! Amazing televisions. The breakfast buffet here is hands down my favorite at any resort. Fresh, delicious, local. I stuff myself with fresh poke, sashimi, asian dumplings, acai parfaits with fresh guava puree, buttery pastries, fresh fruits, made to order breakfast items, delicious daily juice specials, and that's just a few of the selections.    I used to write reviews often, but have grown tired of it. But today I decided this resort deserves the time it takes for me to write this. It is simply the best.

532982179,50,Nicest resort in Hawaii,"My wife and I are fortunate, we travel to 5 star locations and resorts. We were at this resort in 2008, and chose to come back because of travel advisories in Mexico. In the past, we have found Mexico service better. We were at Montage Maui last year, and found it just ok. We've been to the FS Hualalai 4 times and each time noticed the resort getting more and more run down, yet the prices go up. The service there of late has been terrible. So with trepidation, we booked Lanai. Everything about the trip so far (still here) has been 5 star. From the lounge in Honolulu Airport being accessible friendly and 5 star to the transportation from Lanai airport to the resort. To the greeting and rooms. The resort other than structure is all new.. rooms landscape pools & restaurants. Our suite is unbelievable with a $6k toilet (in all rooms) to high tech lights shades doors iPads etc. everyone knows our names, and food orders allergies etc. There is not one detail of this place amiss. The staff is well trained and attentive. Love the 10K Tuuci umbrellas. Only negative is cost. But relative to Hualalai which is similar price but 1/2 the service and dirty rooms well worth it. My only concern as the resort gets busier: can I get the same room for the same price a year from now? We will be back for sure. Mr Ellison et al did a great job. Kudos to the management and staff.

Snorkeling also is incredible - far better than any sites we've been to in other Hawaiian islands (and we've been to and snorkeled at all major islands except for Molokai) Room and the property in general are immaculate, although that was expected given that the hotel is brand new. The island of Lanai is fascinating as well - make sure to rent a Jeep for at least a day and explore the island. Lastly, this place is not cheap.

The golf course was spectacular. Challenging and unique. Great ocean views from almost every hole.    Wonderful hand-crafted cocktails. Expensive at $17 & up each, but so distinctive and interesting!

527320023,50,"Stunning Property, Amazing Stay","We stayed at the Four Seasons Lanai Manele Bay for 5 nights in mid September, 2017. It was our first time to Hawaii, and the first stop of two for our honeymoon.    This was, without a doubt, the best hotel/resort experience I have ever had. From the moment we were greeted at the (tiny!) airport, to them upgrading us for our honeymoon, to being referred to by our names (and by the end of the stay, we were never even asked our names anymore; the whole staff seemed to recognize us), to the pools, the beach, and the outstanding staff, everything about this property is well done.    Our room was amazing. The bed was comfortable, the technology in the room great (buttons for lights and shades, including black out shades that actually keep it very dark in your room!), the Toto toilets in the bathroom, a beautiful shower and soaking tub, phenomenal outdoor space. We had an ocean view room that was very far away from the main lobby (building 4), but loved how private that felt. The walk to and from the room to the lobby/pool/beach is lovely; you walk through a forest of birds, trees, foliage, flowers, water features...it's just stunning.    We spent time at both the adult pool and family pool, and each was as lovely as the other. The way the seating is set up around the pools makes it feel quiet and private no matter where you are sitting. They have all sorts of separate nooks so that you never feel like you are lined up one after another after another, crammed in together. It's always possible to find a secluded spot. Someone finds you right away to help you get set up, take food and drink orders, and they regularly come by to check on you. As I mentioned before, they use your name and remember it when you return the next day! It's a small thing, but it makes you feel special/wanted as a guest at the resort.    The beach is lovely. We were concerned about this, but needn't have been. Nice, wide, stretch of sandy beach. Great staff to set you up in shade or sun, or in the sun with an umbrella for ample shade. The water is wonderful. It was very warm in September, and some days had larger waves than others, but always great. As in all of Hawaii, it is a public beach, and being able to share the beach with other people was something we really enjoyed (and also were able to learn the calmest place to walk in, where the best snorkeling is, etc., by watching the people who know the beach best!).    Food was, overall, very good. Our favorite was Nobu, a shockingly good experience. We ended up eating here twice in our five night stay. The Sports Bar, despite it's name, is a great spot for lunch or dinner and make really awesome tiki cocktails. There are also pool tables and other activities within the lounge area. The steakhouse, One Forty, made a wonderful breakfast buffet and a la carte items, and our steak dinner was very good. Like the rest of the resort, the service at each of the restaurants was great. We enjoyed lunch at the pool and also at Malibu Farms, the poolside restaurant. Great food and drinks! They welcomed us back if we had been before, sometimes even remembering what we drank/ate previously.    There are tons of excursions if you want to be active, but this is also a perfect resort to spend all of your time in. We went out in a Jeep down sandy/dirt roads to see the island, and also did a sunset cruise. Highly recommend both activities, and highly recommend spending time lounging all day by the ocean and the pool.    We also enjoyed the spa. It's stunning, quiet, cool, and a great place to relax after massages/spa treatments.    The lobby/central area was nice and open, with a great view over the water. There are two gift shops, one that carries higher end clothing/accessories and one that has more gift-y things and also snacks, sunscreen, etc.    Really can't say enough great things about this resort. The property is gorgeous; I truly don't think there is a bad room on site. The ""Garden View"" rooms, which overlook the garden in the center, offer plenty of privacy behind the foliage while sitting on the lanais. The ocean view rooms all also offer great privacy because of the design of the resort.    A great resort for a beautiful and relaxing trip for families, couples, friends.    Go, go, go!    For what it's worth, we next stayed on the Big Island at Four Seasons Hualalai, and Four Seasons Lanai beat that property out in every single way that mattered to us. Four Seasons Lanai was the best decision we could have made for the luxurious, relaxing, special trip that we had hoped for.

525010890,50,One of the best resorts in the world.,"Overall, the Four Seasons, Lanai is one of the best resort experiences you can find. From the seamless check in, to the beautiful rooms and the Four Seasons level service, it's the best of the best.    From the moment you arrive at the airport, their team knows you're coming, so theres no waiting in line to ""check in"". You'll get a lei, and a drink and someone will personally escort you to your room. The property itself is stunning.    Your room will be just as impressive. The bathroom is huge, and there are top of the line details and technology throughout. Definitely things you'd expect to have at this price range.    Then, there are all of the little things that really, are big things. Every person who works there acknowledges you, if you ask for directions, they show you where to go personally, they anticipate anything you may need, and every other aspect of service you might expect, they have covered.    My only recommendation is that there should be some sort of complimentary hotel shuttle to and from the airport. It would have made things so much easier. If you want the Four Seasons shuttle, I believe it's about $75 each way, for a shared shuttle with other hotel guests. Private shuttles are even more expensive.

I played daily golf (pristine course with ocean views everywhere and a great staff). We had planned to go to Oahu on this trip but decided to extend instead. As you'd expect at a high end property with no nearby competition, and in Hawaii generally, food is very expensive. We ate ~20 meals on property and in each restaurant and were happy with the food. We felt Nobu was worth the premium. We preferred the golf course (Views) menu for lunch. Overall, Service was impeccable at every touch point.

We had planned to return to Las Ventanas where we were married, but a hurricane changed our plans and we had two days to switch everything. Having been to the other Hawaiian Islands, Lanai was on our list. The Four Seasons was so accommodating helping us make reservations, book activities, and dinners on such short notice. We booked several activities (UTV's, horseback riding, clay shooting range, sunset cruise, mountain bikes) and also did some hiking and tennis at the resort. I thought it would be too much and not very relaxing, but because the resort arranges the activities and shuttles and you don't have to travel that far, it was so easy and we made it back for plenty of pool time. The spa is a must! We both had a few treatments and the steam room and sauna are available to guests any time during open hours. I was worried we'd get tired of eating at the same places everyday since we were there for a week, but that was not the case. Although there are a limited number of restaurants at the resort, the quality and options available at each were great. The rooms and facilities such as the restaurants, gym, spa, etc. were what you'd expect from Four Seasons and I'd probably say it's one of the nicest Four Seasons we've stayed at. The investment in technology (ipad for room guides, digital lights and shades, toto toilet) was a nice addition. The resort has beautiful views of the ocean (we even saw some dolphins one morning) and is a short distance from Sweetheart rock. It's a quick shuttle to the airport, the off site activities, and the small town. It was not at full capacity while we were there so we never had trouble finding a chair and while there weren't many kids there, there was an adult pool. Finally, I just have to compliment the service. We met so many wonderful people there who truly made our experience exceptional. This is a place you can relax or be as adventurous as you want.

520544806,50,Oh my .....,"What can I say other than WOW. This place is beyond great and you realize that the second you walk on the property. Immediately you are greeted by numerous friendly people many of whom remembered our names throughout our short stay here. I have nothing but good to say about the resort having stayed many places across the country and even internationally. This place is number one without reservation. It feels like a private south seas resort with a fabulous staff and immaculate foliage filled grounds. I talked to several staff members who have worked here around 20 years and are, by their admission, well treated by management and that means a lot to me. Employee loyalty is not often seen nowadays and I could tell by their non verbal responses that they were treated at least reasonably well. The staff was almost TOO attentive to our needs and were all delightful and friendly. I felt like I almost had to stop and talk to them because of their gregariousness. Naturally, we spent a great deal of time on the resort and loved every second of it. Our travel package included a $200 daily resort fee/activity fee that we had to use or lose and we opted for a UTV tour of the mountainous areas in a Polaris RZR which was a blast. We were covered in a light patina of red dirt we barely noticed until we wiped off with a wet towel afterward! We also took a sunset catamaran around the south coast which was stunning. These two activities are reviewed separately. Today, which is our last day, we are taking a sunset ""9"" which is a nine hole golf outing. There are many many activities to do and they are well outlined on an easy to read schedule provided by the activity desk.    Our room was simply amazing with a garden view and a 70"" smart TV connected to the internet perfect for streaming late night movies/TV shows. I loved the Nespresso machine in the room and drank more than a few on the balcony in early am. There was 24 hour room service which we took advantage of and was delicious and prompt. A few things to know going in however. This is a VERY isolated place and Lana'i has only one town where everyone lives (population just over 3000). There are no rental cars (you can rent a jeep by the day apparently for off roading) and the hotel has complementary trips into Lanai city but they are infrequent and there isn't much to do in town with only a few shops and restaurants. We loved going into town but had to secure a private shuttle to go back or we would have had to kill 2 1/2 additional hours. The private shuttle was great but has limited hours and was inexpensive. And, knowing this is a Four Seasons one would predict the food to be pricey and if you assume so you are more than correct. Every meal runs probably 1.5x to 2x what you would expect to pay on Kaua'i and we quickly realized that even sandwiches and beer at lunch ran ~ $100 dollars with tip. Dinner at One Forty had a $95 dollar rib eye. Diet Cokes were $6 a can and there we NO drinks or snacks in the shops on site (we did get some snacks and drinks in town and laughed at our ""$72 dollar"" 12 pack of soda :) ). Just know this going in and expect to pay a lot for meals which were all high quality. These things however were not enough to distract from the pure beauty and quality of this place and we will return without hesitation or reservation. I do mean what I say when I brag on this place being our number one without thinking twice. ALSO know there is a very reasonable ferry located virtually on site that takes you directly to a shopping district in Maui and runs several times a day. We did not realize this in time to take advantage of it but plan on it next time. We cannot wait to come back ...",Sep 2017,August 2017,Traveled as a couple,NO bad rooms,"Fishers, Indiana"

The old resort at manele bay was dated but beach comfortable and relaxed. The updated resort features state of the art technology, new pools, lush gardens, comfortable and modern decor. The hotel has expanded activities and now owns the former trilogy boats.    The staff is amazing, everyone was incredibly helpful and everyone knew or asked and remembered our names. The pool staff, housekeeping, concierage, sports bar bartenders/servers, everyone was truly in a class of their own.    The breakfast buffet is extensive, including sushi and dumplings with a great omelette bar...hot items are made to order with the buffet...it costs $52/adult plus tax and gratuity. (Every other hotel, including the old manele bay, I've ever stayed in through Amex platinum FHR has included breakfast buffet for two adults with gratuity included, the $45 ""credit"" only covered 2/3 of the breakfast buffet at Manele.    This hotel is amazing, it's very relaxing and the staff are there to help you enjoy your vacation. The golf course is amazing, the garden    The kids club is among the best my children have ever experienced and the women running it do a wonderful job.    The sunset sail and the snorkel trip in the morning are magnificent and everyone should experience them. We saw dolphins, octopus, a lobster, tons of colorful fish. At $150/pp it is worth it.    A few constructive feedback points:    There were a few little things that have changed with new management.    1) No longer is there lemonade at the pool and beach. The individual ""mini kegs"" of water are great but I missed the lemonade.    2) the pool situation is very different. The adult pool is a man made grotto like experience...except there is bird poop on the rocks, making an otherwise pleasant experience, not so much.    3) the grass area under the chairs by the pool is synthetic, it's natural looking but it gets hot just like the sand on a beach.    4) everything is 20pct more expensive than Maui, which is unnecessary.    5) the half hour shuttle to town no longer available. They run two shuttles, reservations required, per day from hotel to town, three return trips. This is probably the biggest negative development under the new mgnt, they should bring the shuttle back, maybe make it hourly. The ""taxi service"" on the island is not a taxi, it's a shuttle from town to airport to hotel or town to dock...you should not expect to call the""taxi"" other than around plane & ferry schedule. I'd bet two or three people driving Prius's using UBER would do pretty well on Lanai.    6) the main boutique in the hotel is not only a high end boutique but it's high fashion; $300 cover ups for women, $300 bathing suits for men, $9,000 Chanel outfit for women....we didn't see one person buy anything while we were there.    Lastly, Lanai is a remote paradise that is a very unique experience. The new owners have spent a lot of money changing and upgrading the facilities; it's very noticeable and very well done.However, this has come at a significant expense to guests. Occupancy was maybe 40pct while we were there, during a busy vacation week for east coast and west coast people. The choices for people vacationing at this price point can get a similar, but as special, in many easier places in Hawaii to get to from the mainland...The montage, FS Hanalei, Ritz Kapalua, etc.    In order to entice people after the initial ""newly renovated"" marketing point, the management needs to lower price points and make activity costs or packages more attractive given the logistics of getting to Lanai.    Many people I spoke with stayed on other islands but would have preferred to spend more time on Lanai but the cost difference for the experience isn't justified. As a result, Lanai will likely remain a short part of a longer trip for many non private jet visitors.    Perhaps once the lodge is up and running, the biz model changes but I worry the current business plan is just going to loose money for the owner. This could lead to issues with the community/employees, as it did with the previous owner.    There is such an awesome opportunity on Lanai for the owner, the employees and the tourist but the current operating plan seems to be under delivering for all three.",Sep 2017,August 2017,Traveled with family,,"Chatham, New Jersey"
520358175,50,Worth it,"I was fortunate to stay here late last year when they had pretty good specials on the room rates. It's just as beautiful as the pictures. I thought it might be a bit of a hassle getting to Lanai, but the Hawaiian Airlines flight from Honolulu was pretty easy. The drive from the airport to the resort is about twenty minutes, and the first glimpse you'll get of the ocean is pretty awesome. Every employee I encountered was friendly and helpful. Breakfast at One Forty was phenomenal. I'd go back to Lanai just to eat there again. The food, the view and the kindness of the servers there could not have been better. Malibu Farm at the pool and Views at the golf course were great, too. The golf course was everything I hoped it would be. It might be even more breathtaking than the pictures on the website, especially the back nine. Even if you're not a golfer, go check out the course. The course wasn't crowded any of the days I played, which makes it an even nicer experience. The golf staff was extremely friendly, too.

520336013,50,Paradise Perfected,"Warning!!!! This is going to sound like a paid for advertisement but I assure you it is not. Let me start by saying that aside from knowing that the Four Seasons experience is always great we booked this vacation with no idea really what Lanai was like. My husband and I went to celebrate my 50th birthday and after first investigating Bora Bora, Bali and Maldeves we decided to reduce the travel time by choosing a nearer island getaway. I can honestly say that we made the perfect choice. We paid for the Love Lanai package and in Robert Frost's words taking the road less traveled made all of the difference. The package includes an unlimited amount of activities and I don't think we would have done them all if we hadn't pre-paid for them all. Skeet Shooting and Archery with Dennis, Sunset sails and snorkel sails with Martin, Kama, Kristin and Junior of Lanai Ocean Sports (I will be going into detail when I review on their site) and Horseback riding with Joel. The adventures made my 50th birthday what a 50th birthday should be-checking off the bucket list and being pampered! One of the coolest things about the whole experience was that this is probably the closest thing to being at your own private resort on your own private island as you will ever get.  Upon arrival we were greeted with a Lei and taken to our room by our own ambassador-there was no checking in at the front desk. We paid for an OceanFront room that seemed off to the side instead of oceanfront. They moved us right away to a more oceanfront room without argument. The grounds were beautiful, the beach was secluded with the most amazing snorkel area, there was hardly anyone in the pools most of the time and I probably had the best dinner that I have ever had in my life at One Forty (grey snapper). The staff was exactly what you come to expect from Four Seasons-polite, conversational and top notch. The general manager Alastair happened to be walking past us as we were heading to check out and he grabbed our bags for us and asked all about our stay. if I had to give you a con it would be the cost to eat-since the Four Seasons is the only resort on the island and the city of Lanai has a population of around 3000 your options for dining out are very limited. Eating at the resort is extremely expensive-one morning we grabbed two bagels, two coffees and a cup of fruit and it came to almost $50. We were prepared for this and had made the intention to not stress over it before we arrived.",Sep 2017,August 2017,,,"Phoenix, Arizona"
520249469,50,They went above and beyond,"After getting married on Oahu, my husband and I had a ""mini-moon"" at the Four Seasons Manele about 3 1/2 years ago. Unfortunately, they were in the midst of a remodel and it wasn't the experience we were hoping for. At the time, hotel management advised us that they would like to make things right once the remodel was over.    3 1/2 years late, we finally found the time to get back to Manele and were amazed to see the changes there. The resort is beautiful, peaceful, and quiet. Landscaping is full of Hawaiian plants like ginger, palms, and ti leaf so there is no need for lawnmowers first thing in the morning and there are little private nooks surrounding the pools and rooms. The rooms have the latest tech gear with automated blinds, lighting, and toilets. Your room key is a waterproof bracelet, so no worrying about carrying your key around at the beach and in the ocean. The staff is friendly and helpful.    I'm glad we went back.

518598331,50,Wow...A Resort that Makes You Feel Like Family,"I have been lucky enough to stay at some great hotels around the world but the Four Seasons Lanai is a step above all. The rooms and finishes are beautiful, the grounds stunning and the vibe of the whole place subdued and relaxed. The physical beauty of the resort and surrounding hiking areas is amazing. What makes his place stand out however is the people. Lanai has had a boom and bust history as an island and you get the sense that the staff many of whom are local are so proud of the place and more importantly genuinely interested in making your stay a great one. This is not just a well trained four seasons staff but a group that knows your name from the first day on, that engages in conversation about your day and goes out of their way to meet every need. As an example, we were met at the airport by a concierge who then drove us to the resort, gave us all of her inside advice of what to do and not do, and then proceeded to give us a tour of the grounds and room. The bird man on property - Bruno - became fast friends with my teenage kids and every waiter seems to know about our activities. If I had any small nit picks, I would say that the hotel should provide a complimentary coffee station in the morning versus having to buy it, the pool layout is a little strange with chairs spread out around a winding pool, and there is no alcohol allowed on the beach as it is a state park beach. This is also not a place with nightlife or night activity if you are looking for that. What it is is a place to recharge, enjoy beautiful rooms, grounds and solid food, and most of all become part of the family.",Aug 2017,August 2017,Traveled with family,,"Scarsdale, New York"

517736445,50,Possibly the best hotel experience ever,"I have traveled over the years to many destinations and stayed at two other Four Seasons hotels, but I will have to say the Four Seasons Lanai is just a cut above the other resorts. This could be because Lanai owner Larry Ellison put much time and effort into designing the hotel. I am from Hawaii, and have heard he was very particular about the hotel renovations and spared no expense in construction. There were many building change orders. The property is stunning, and all the restaurants are partially open air and take full advantage of the ocean and beach views. The hotel staff were all well trained; all very courteous and remembered my name, too. There were many activities arranged through the hotel to choose from, so there was very little possibility of getting bored on such a small island. I booked my reservation through the hotel, but the concierge suggested I link the booking to American Express Platinum fine resorts and hotels booking service. This included a $200 per day activity credit and $45 per day, per person, breakfast credit. This booking allowed us to receive an upgrade to a partial ocean view. The hotel is obviously not for the cost conscious person, but I think you truly get your money's worth for what you pay. The total experience of the hotel, the amenities, and the beauty of the island all incorporate into one of the most memorable hotel stays in my life.",Aug 2017,August 2017,,,"Honolulu, Hawaii"

Has a Nobu on property and generally better food than we found on other islands. Not sure I would stay on Lanai for 2 weeks+ but ~a week perfect. One warning is the definition of full ocean view room may disappoint slightly but once you are settled in the rooms are impeccable and incredibly high tech with full feature Toto toilets and massive UltraHD TVs.

The golf was a bit difficult for my wife. Course is perfect, but lots of long carries for a women player. The Four Seasons’ activities are great, snorkeling trip, atvs, horses, sporting clays, sunset cruise, etc. I would not recommend this property for a 1st time visit to Hawaii, so a person can see all the typical attractions.

We took a 20 minute flight from O'ahu and since this was our first time island hopping, we didn't really know what to expect from this tiny but special-beyond-words place.  As soon as we arrived, our taxi driver was waiting for us and we were shuttled to the resort where Jake the front desk ambassador was so engaging and welcoming, we were somehow whisked away and momentarily forgot to pay our cab driver! Whoops!  He escorted us to our room and gave us all of the useful information/directions regarding the property's offerings and made insightful recommendations about the island. Our room was upgraded to a partial ocean view and it was absolutely beautiful! Everything was immaculate and in pristine condition. We immediately set out to enjoy ""The Retreat"" (adults only pool) and were taken care of by Nancy who was excellent and I have to say, there wasn't a moment we spent at the pool throughout our stay that didn't feel relaxing and perfectly attended to. Every single meal we had on property was phenomenal, too! My favorites being the Surfin Grilled Cheese, lobster mashed potatoes, and pokeviche! Just wow! In-room dining service was also wonderful and always prompt in delivery. We had the pleasure of indulging in One Forty's ""grand buffet"" and it was absolutely SINFUL! (Check out the separate review!) Highly recommend to travelers and locals alike!  On our second day, we spent a few hours down at Hulopoe beach and Jay's service was warm and so friendly! The water was pristine and the visibility was something I'll never forget. We unfortunately didn't see dolphins in the bay on this trip but I'm hopeful for next time as I've heard they frequent the calm warm waters here.  For our last night in paradise, we were lucky enough to reserve a couple of seats on a sunset catamaran sail that was so unbelievably breathtaking with views of Manele Bay, Sweetheart Rock, Maui, and Kaho'olawe! I would do this excursion again 100 times over and I'll be recommending it to everyone!  Mahalo Nui Loa again to the many staff members who truly personalized our stay and made us feel so special.

The staff was friendly and super helpful, setting up activities for you and giving you advice on things to do (which are not too many in Lanai), but they did have some great suggestions. The only reason I am giving this resort four stars, instead of five, is because we had an awful experience at the Nobu Restaurant at the property. Our waitress was 100% incompetent, even when we reminded here constantly of everything that she was forgetting to bring us (including our food), she still couldn't seem to comprehend what to do (get us our food). Although the manager was working, we were unable to get his attention to complain, because he was too busy bragging to the table behind us about how important he is to pay any attention to anything other than his ego.

503876059,50,Amazing property- Don't miss this one,"I was fortunate to recently stay at the newly renovated Four Seasons Lanai. I have stayed in many Four Seasons throughout the world and this one ranks amongst the tops that I have ever set foot in.    The impeccable service begins from the time you make your reservation. Samara called me to make sure that all of my dinner reservations and excursions were confirmed and asked if there was anything special that we were celebrating, any dietary restrictions or anything that we needed placed in the room prior to our arrival. That was just the start of amazing service. When you arrive at the Lanai airport, you are met with cool towels and bottles of water. The staff there handles all of your luggage and escorts you to their waiting transportation for the short drive to the resort. Upon arrival, you are greeted by their many staff members (and a beautiful view of the bay and shoreline of Lanai) that whisk you through the check in process and you are off to your room. The smallest of the room categories start at 700 square feet and every room has 75inch televisions.    The hotel was closed for over a year for a complete renovation and it shows. The rooms have a new look that is contemporary with neutral colors and an Asian inspired flare. The public areas of the hotel are adorned with interesting, historic artifacts from around the islands. It is a great mix of modern aesthetics and historical items which blend perfectly.    After check in, we made our way to their lunch restaurant, Malibu Farms. This restaurant serves sustainable foods that are sourced mostly from the farms on island. They have two restaurants for dinner – Nobu and Forty One. We dined at both and the service, food quality and ambiance were exactly what you would expect from a Four Seasons. The menus change nightly so you do not feel like you are dining at the same restaurant on multiple nights.    If you have a chance to make it to Hawaii, do not leave Lanai off your list. This hotel is not one to be missed. The staff exudes the true “Aloha Spirit” and want to make sure that every guests feels like they are the only ones on the island.

The resort is gorgeous, the people are some of the kindest ever, and the experience and hospitality you expect at a Four Seasons is exceptional here. We were so completely happy the whole entire time. From our pickup and arrival, to the free upgrade to a larger suite...you just charmed us so much. One thing I must rave about is the food quality- organic, gluten-free-free, choices....impeccable. You made it SO easy to eat healthfully and well here- one of my biggest complaints with most resorts is that the food is bad and not fresh or healthy- your food experience here is top notch.

499895074,50,Secluded Island Paradise,"The setting is hard to describe in words. A dramatic, eye catching, island contemporary Four Seasons that has been recently remodeled top to bottom. It is built around lava rock leading down to the beautiful beach at Hulopoe Bay.    The rooms are not stacked up on each other but discreetly situated down dark wooden walkways that traverse beautiful koi ponds and lush tropical gardens. I'm not big into gadgets, but I was impressed with the tech amenities- the shades on our balcony, and the mood lighting were all controlled at by a central system and remote. Even the Toto bidet/toilet combo inspired. With a wave of your hand the toilet seat cover would rise to reveal a warmed toilet seat.    Hulopoe Bay has some amazing scuba diving and the hotel connected me with a scuba guide. We were also able to shuttle off property a couple times to explore the town of Lanai and experience their island festival with a hula presentation and local food booths. We wanted to check out the Lodge at Keole, which was under construction, so we hiked way above it to see a stunning view of three different islands. We also booked a catamaran snorkeling tour with lunch which was great. My husband really enjoyed the hotel golf course and I enjoyed joining him for an amazing lunch on the clubhouse patio.    You have a choice of restaurants but after experiencing Nobu Lanai once, we didn't need to eat there again, so we were left with One Forty and the bar menu, which felt slightly limiting for the rest of our dinners. Malibu Farms, which had recently opened as the pool restaurant, was great for lunch but didn't offer much in the way of breakfast and wasn't open for dinner.

The rooms are beautifully done also with 75 inch TVs. The staff throughout the resort are friendly and helpful, the food is great and the overall experience is amazing.

Unfortunately the staff will not make you feel welcome anywhere on the grounds unless you are a guest. First, at Malibu Farms the staff asked if they could use my daughters high chair while we were still eating. That is unacceptable, I can't believe that we had the only high chair. Second, if you get a treatment at the spa you are not allowed to use the rest of the facility. Third, there are no cabanas or chairs to rent for the day unless you are a guest. Fourth, when it came time to leave the Four Seasons to go to the Pineapple Festival the concierge will not call a limo service unless you are a guest, that is just poor service. While we were waiting in the lobby for the limousine service to take us to the Pineapple Festival the bell man kept asking my wife if she called.

498145229,50,Ultimate private island getaway,"Four Seasons has done an incredibly fantastic job to create the ultimate paradise. The resort has been completely rebuilt, and only reopened last year. We did not recognize it at all from our last visit. Environment is serene and calming, with an intention to blend the architecture into its surroundings. I liked the soothing wood tones for a zen and relaxing atmosphere. Room is very spacious and beautifully decorated with nuanced details. It's also super tech savvy. There is an ipad in-room from which to order food, set turn down times, book restaurants and etc. It also has ""smart"" light settings for various moods. The bathroom even has a Japanese auto-toilet!    We stayed for 2 nights this time. For one afternoon, we went diving to see the Cathedral, one of the world's top dive sites. Four Seasons now manage all guest activities on Lanai, and their management / style really carries through. The staff were excellent - friendly, professional and patient, and the equipment is truly top of the line - everything from the speed boat to wet suit to diving gear. It was one of the best dive experiences that I've ever had. I was told that almost all activities can be tailored to guest needs - small groups, dedicated experienced staff and customized. We also snorkeled at Hulopoe Beach (fantastic marine sanctuary with almost daily dolphin sightings in early mornings!), which is just 5-10 mins walk . Again, a thoroughly pampered experience with the Four Seasons beach station.    Food is absolutely superb - with Nobu and Malibu Farm onsite. I adored the buffet breakfast - probably THE BEST that I've ever had, with a full Asian, international and local spreads. I had a fantastic sushi breakfast one morning.

Four Seasons drove us back to the resort where our luggage was handled. We were surprised with an upgrade- the most beautiful room I have ever seen. We had a partial garden view, partial ocean view, a private balcony with sunset views, a bidet that gave us amazing snap chat footage (not kidding), TWO shower + bath(s), and a television in the mirrors in the bathroom. Not only was our room completely amazing, but the entire resort was hands down the best thing I have ever seen.    We made friends with the parrots whom say “aloha” and everywhere we went on the resort we were congratulated on our nuptials! The resort is home to two of my favorite restaurants, Malibu Farm House and Nobu… WE ate like royalty. The drinks were outstanding, order the jalapeño during the day as you lounge poolside (with ocean views).    The adult pool is truly an adult sanctuary, simple water falls, views for days- and its all 21+.    We made friends with other honeymooners and even combined dinner tables one night. Post dinner hit the Sports Bar to play shuffleboard with them, and when our night continued passed the time of close, the staff allowed us to stay up playing pool until we desired to leave.    The SPA is outrageous- I had the “Ocean Ritual” Treatment which included a three hour treatment of bliss while my husband golfed :) I realized the Spa Manager just moved over from the Mandarin in Atlanta.

One last thing I was very unhappy about....when you fly in to Lanai.....the resort offers a shuttle to the resort.....wait for it ......at a cost of $50 a person....for about a 15 min. drive. Yes so if your a family of four thats a $200 ride from the airport and $200 more back to the airport. I find that a bit much especially considering the cost of a room in this resort.

We received a warm welcome the minute we exited the shuttle van and received amazing service all day, every day, everywhere we went - dining areas, poolside, spa, activities center. I felt like the ratio of staff to guests was 2 to 1. Staff went out of their way to make sure you were taken care of and all your needs were being met. Thanks to all staff members for making us feel so pampered and special. This resort has 2 beautiful pools, 1 for families and 1 for adults only. Both were empty or had 2-4 guests in it during anytime of the day. Exactly what I was looking for when planning my vacation! There are lounge chairs ALL OVER the place, facing the pool, facing the ocean, in the shade, in the sun...you name it, you can pick your spot! So many chairs that you have plenty of space to enjoy your own private paradise without having others to the left and right of you. Dining options were all excellent from fancy restaurants to casual indoor or outdoor dining- great food choices, flavorful and delicious. Restaurant prices are high but it's to be expected at a 5 star hotel. Rooms were luxurious, beds were like sleeping on a cloud! The spa was also a wonderful experience.

494388597,50,Paradise – Lanai now a must stop Hawaiian Island,"This isn’t a short review, but it’s one you will be glad you read.    If you’re looking for a tropical, warm, beautiful, relaxing, luxurious destination, there is absolutely no reason to consider anywhere else in the world to vacation than the Four Seasons Lanai, as it will become your vacation dream of a lifetime. On Lanai, there is no worry of mosquitos carrying Zika, Malaria or West Nile. No concerns of contaminated water ruining your vacation, or an area of crime you need to avoid. The Four Seasons Lanai will exceed your expectations, and is truly a destination worth considering for anyone in the world. And if you’re from the countries of Japan, China or Korea, you will find bilingual staff to speak to you in your native language.    Once there you will experience Paradise. Why?    The Resort – Directly on the ocean, breathtakingly beautiful, secluded, romantic, luxurious, amenities beyond imagination, wood finishes throughout, floor to ceiling windows, rooms and balconies with ocean views, so quiet and private you can sleep with your sliding glass door open to hear the ocean, and plush landscaping that creates the feeling you’re on a private island.    The Food – No matter what country you are from, the food is glorious. Breakfast; if from Asia, Japan China or Korea, the breakfast buffets offer you tremendous varieties of specific items prepared especially for you. For English countries, traditional omelets, pancakes and waffles will leave you amazed that you never tasted ones so delicious. For dinner, to mention two; Nobu’s Japanese cuisine menu is especially with Asian travelers in mind, but still immensely enjoyed by this sushi loving reviewer. One-Forty is a seafood and steak restaurant where everything is so fresh and so well-seasoned, you will be tasting preparations like you never have before.    The Activities – From sandy beaches, beautiful pools, outdoor hot tubs, oceanside hiking trails, large screen TV’s in a custom sports bar to keep you in touch with your favorite teams, shooting and archery range, complete spa, multiple land and ocean tours, opportunities for children, and Manele oceanside golf course which in 2017 was ranked the eighteenth finest resort course in the country by Golfweek magazine. Many holes border the ocean, with every hole so well designed and manicured to remember its beauty, you will want a camera to take a few pictures as I did to remember your round.    The Ease of Travel – Paradise can be experienced so easily by a 36-minute plane ride from the Honolulu airport, or a 45-minute ferry ride from Maui.    The Four Seasons Lanai is somewhere you want to experience in your lifetime, I am grateful I had the opportunity.",Jun 2017,May 2017,Traveled as a couple,A room with a balcony adds to the romance.,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"
493128985,50,Unbelievable secluded beach holiday... Possibly unsurpassable!,"My wife and I stayed at the hotel for 7 days and it was an absolutely heavenly experience - I suspect we will struggle to find a beach holiday that comes anywhere close.    It should be stated from the outset that the Four Seasons Lanai is where you come if you want to experience the best of Hawaii away from any crowds whatsoever. It is the closest you can come to being on a private island without actually renting / owning one yourself. You fell utterly secluded and even with the hotel full, it felt like there were just a handful of people there with us: restaurants always had a table, the best sunbeds were always available, and the beach was always pristine and quiet.    From the moment you are welcomed into the stunning hotel lobby with the breathtaking view of the marine-preservation bay to the moment you check out, the service levels are absolutely impeccable.    There are enough activities (we did most!) to keep you busy when you get a bit bored of swimming in that gorgeous bay, such as horseriding, scuba, snuba, archery and shooting, off-road driving and mountain biking, even helicopter rides and sailing trips.    Getting there is a bit of a pain but worth it - we took the flight to Maui and the ferry from there, which I understand is a bit more reliable than the island-hopper flight from Honolulu.

492729037,50,Service! Service! Service!,"We spent over a week at the Four Seasons Lanai at the end of May. Our trip started as a company trip which we extended to celebrate our 25 year anniversary. The resort is beautiful and I have to say, the service is amazing! The staff went out of their way to help us with whatever we needed. Everyone took the time to greet us byname throughout our stay. Upon our arrival we were greeted with the traditional lei and because they knew it was our anniversary we were also given glasses of champagne. The room was very nice. Everything was state of the art, including the toilet! We were surprised in our room with wine and cheese. After traveling for most of the day, it was a needed surprise. Since this was our first vacation without kids, we chose to sit for the first day in the adult only pool area. I can't say enough about the staff at the pool area. They were attentive and helpful. Throughout the day we were spritzed with evian, our sun glasses were cleaned and we were brought complimentary snacks. Drinks and food we ordered were brought to us very quickly. We ended up spending the whole week in this area. From here, there was a adult only pool and an amazing view of the ocean. Next lets talk about the spa. We signed up for a massage and a facial. The massage was very good, but the facial was one of the best we have had. I told the facialist about my various skin allergies and she knew exactly what products to use and which ones would not be good for me. The OSEA products are top of the line. We had a couple of company dinners on the property which were very nice. On our own, we ate at One forty, Nobu and the Sports Bar. One forty was our favorite. The food was fresh and they offered very interesting specials. Again the service and view was special. We were sat at the best table in the restaurant and presented with a dozen long stem red roses for our anniversary and that night when we returned to our room, rose petals had been placed all around the room. As far as breakfast, if you want a big breakfast go to the breakfast buffet at one forty. They have everything you could want there from omelettes to smoothies or juice drinks. The first day we weren't that hungry and ordered a la carte at one forty for breakfast and to be honest the price was about the same as the buffet, so I would advise the buffet. If you really want something lite, a couple of days we had breakfast in the sports bar. There were pastries, bagels, fruit coffee and of course the view. The beach is beautiful and as soon as the beach staff sees you walking down to the beach, they are ready to set up chair and an umbrella for you. We picked up snorkel equipment and snorkeled off the beach. The water is very calm early in the day. The gym offered a great view and many classes and was never crowded. Lastly, my husband and I loved the beautiful birds in the lobby. We mentioned it to someone at the front desk and although the person that normally takes care of the birds was away, she arranged for us to hold and take pictures with the birds.

The view at breakfast was very special and set the day up nicely. It would appear that all rooms have a great view. Only downside is this level of luxury comes at an eye watering level of expense - if you want a real upmarket experience, it is worth remembering that it is only money.",May 2017,May 2017,Traveled as a couple,,"Binfield, United Kingdom"

Within 10 minutes of meeting we started hitting balls on one of the hard courts. The court was immaculate. I thought we were just going to hit, as I'm not a terrible player, but Ryan took it as a lesson from the outset. Which was fortunate, because apparently I've been doing everything wrong since I picked up a racquet 20 years ago. Hahaha. Ryan changed my game (or at least provided me with quick easy tools to do so, i.e.: footwork and ball contact position goals) in minutes and was understanding of my deeply entrenched lack of proper technique. He was even complimentary in a diplomatic sort of way: ""You've honed the wrongness to a very high level,"" he said. Thanks, Ryan! The resort is next level world class, but it's my experience with Mr. Winters up on the tennis court that afternoon that still makes me smile.

482441013,50,Good news and less good news,"Lanai is remote. They actually built TWO four seasons on this island of 3,000 with two world class golf courses, one in the ocean and one in the hills like a hunting lodge. Thstbine failed. They're remaking it into a spa hotel (think canyon ranch) but the golf course is gone. We stayed at manele bay, the recently re-done four seasons on the water. It's the most beautiful hotel we've ever stayed at, and thanks to Larry Ellison of Oracle who owns literally 98% of Lanai, it's a marvel of technology. Staff is fab, food is fab, rooms are fab, and there's a Nobu there. Spa is fab, looks are fab, golf course is fab. You get my drift. Would I go back there? NOOOOOOO. it's too damn expensive. It's really expensive and you're in the middle of nowhere. If you do anything at all even with the cheapest room it's 2000 a night. I am post op spinal surgery with a couple of fractured vertebrae. They SOLD me two upgrades even tho the hotel was maybe 1/3 occupied. I'm a frequent 4 seasons guest. They didn't care about my inability to navigate this large property. They wanted more money.

Every effort was made to make sure we were comfortable and to anticipate our needs. Truly amazing. We had the most amazing experience swimming in the small bay in front of the hotel and having hundreds of dolphins come and swim right next to us. Lanai itself is very small and unpopulated which means that there are very few services on the island.

The rooms and bathrooms are very spacious and the decor is beautiful. The gardens and pools are beautiful, great to have an adult only pool and there are sufficient sun beds, so no need to ""reserve"" first thing in the mornings. 140 and Nobu are great restaurants serving outstanding food.  We had dinner in the sports bar as well one night and the food was terrible, the burgers were not cooked as ordered and the sides were all wrong, one dish had to be sent back, so I ended having my dinner and was finished by the time my partner got his. They took one meal off the bill, to be honest, they should have waved the whole food bill that evening, as dinner was ruined for us, in my view this was an error of judgment by the manager, but this was the only unpleasant experience, all other meals were outstanding incl breakfast and the snacks by the pool.  The beach is lovely too and very private.  Service was outstanding. We rented a 4x4 and explored the Island which was great, such beautiful place. For some strange reason, it is not possible to take out insurance, so its a bit of a risk, esp as you drive mainly on ""dirt tracks"" and rough terrain and the car could easily be damaged. Prob in the US you are automatically insured through your own car insurance, this is not necessarily the case for foreign visitors and the hotel should explore the opportunity to offer insurance.

475426880,30,"Beautiful Resort, Service Needs Work","My husband and I recently spent four nights at the newly-remodeled Four Seasons Lanai – Manele Bay. We stayed at this resort a few years ago and were excited to see the what changes they made.    The resort itself is beautiful. The rooms are modern, but very tastefully done. There is lots of interesting décor and modern technological touches (touch pads for the window blinds and lights, and ipads to order room service, housekeeping, etc.). The grounds are lush and tropical with waterfalls, koi ponds, two pools and plenty of places to sit and relax. The beach is also beautiful, although the water can be a bit rough at times.    We tried all of the restaurants and found the food to be very good all around.    With all that being said, we thought that the service was extremely inconsistent throughout our stay. There were a couple of times when the staff showed no discretion whatsoever. One morning we were in our room and someone swiped their key and entered the room without knocking. When he saw that we were there, he seemed embarrassed and said he was there to restock the mini bar. It’s a good thing we were dressed and about to go out, otherwise it could have been a lot worse. We were somewhat shocked and appalled that someone would just enter the room without knocking first. We went to the front desk to let them know what happened, and they assured us they would talk to the manager and the staff about it. We thought the issue had been resolved, until 9PM the following evening when, once again, housekeeping tried to get into our room without knocking first. We had the double lock on the door and the Do Not Disturb light on, but she was relentless. After a few tries she finally knocked and asked if we needed housekeeping. Apparently Do No Disturb doesn’t mean much.    The service in the Sports Bar was also inconsistent. One evening we went to play shuffleboard and it took 45 minutes for someone to come over and ask if we wanted something to drink. At breakfast at One Forty, we were asked way too many times by different people how our breakfast was. Once or twice is fine, but we just wanted to sit in peace and enjoy our meal. When I was asked if I wanted my fruit bowl to come out before my pancakes or all together, I replied that it would be great to have it come out together. Less than a minute later the fruit came out, but no pancakes. It’s like the staff didn’t communicate with each other and were on autopilot. The exception seemed to be at the pool, where the staff was attentive, but not overly so.    Had there only been one or two service issues throughout our stay, we wouldn't have complained, but with everything combined we were a bit disappointed, especially since we had no such problems during our first stay here or at any other Four Seasons that we have stayed at in the past.

472774802,50,great addtion to the Hawian properties,"We waited a few years for this property to be completed and it was well worth the wait. They did an incredible job with the renovation which I heard was over 500 Million dollars. The property is like they sliced a piece of Seychelles Four Seasons and placed it in Hawaii. The grounds are among the best I have seen in the world. We have been to over 50 four seasons and other high end resorts like Mandarin Oriental and Rosewood Mexican properties like Mayakoba and Los Ventanos. To have this kind of experience, I have found you would have to go to Thailand or Bali or Seychelles. Not only is the property gorgeous, the beach outside the hotel was excellent. They also have great food service with a Nobu on site which was excellent. We ate there 3 times.  The golf course was great and they also have an excellent stable in the mountains for horse back riding which I did with Mary, one of the guides which was one of the best rides ive had in my life. We rode out into the wooded mountains which was great. Another interesting thing about Lanai is the diversified landscape. You have the beach then drive 20 minutes up the mountain and its a different climate. The elevation is a little over 2000 ft.  The climate in Lanai was also lovely. Not nearly as humid as Maui and there was a nice trade winds for much of the trip.  The island used to have a large pineapple plantation but could not maintain it due to lack of water.  The town is lovely and has an excellent Gallery, Mike Carroll Gallery which was first class. Mike is a great artist and he shows his works at his Gallery in addition to outside world class artists. The prices were very reasonable and Mike will show you around the gallery and explain all the art. He also has amazing Asian furniture pieces and additional items like wooden hand made bowels and sculptures. Its a gallery you would expect to find in San Francisco.  There are also great off roading trails to take through out the island. The hotel offers brand new Jeep wranglers for rent which were great.  The spa was great, newly renovated and the therapists were all excellent. Highly recommended.  The breakfast was excellent as it was a buffet but all the items such as special eggs, pancakes, waffles, bacon etc was cooked to order instead of sitting in a heating pot all morning. It was all made to order and part of the buffet. I was impressed that the hotel went to that level of effort to make everything first class.  The staff was outstanding from the GM and Manager of the hotel. They made ever effort to greet the guests and sincerely made themselves available for any needs that might come up.  In summary, its really fantastic to have a resort so close to the states of this quality comparable to what you would find in Asia or off the coast of South Africa and not have to sit in a plane for three days. I highly recommend this property.",Apr 2017,March 2017,,,"Payson, Arizona"

471746442,50,"Stunning resort, a few small areas to improve","We stayed here for 5 nights, and this was our 4th time since 2012.    First of all, don't stay here if you need to pinch pennies, it is expensive and it just starts with the room rate. Meals are very pricey and there are limited options.    Having said that, the resort is stunning after its renovation but there are a few minor improvement points.    When we first arrived, you're greeted with leis, cold towels and a treat. A guide will take you to your room. Now if the view from the room was not quite what you thought it would be, you need to speak up and ask for a different room. Case in point, we had reserved an oceanfront room, the room offered was more like ocean view, with a garden in front of us and looking sideways into other lanais. The ocean could be seen, but not what most would consider ocean front. After some time, they took care of things and got us into a 'prime ocean front' room. So just be aware of how they categorize the rooms.    The rooms themselves are spectacular, with automated lighting, beautiful decorations, super comfortable bed and linens, great bathroom and amenities. There is a 75"" TV and has a PVR function. Take the time to learn all the features of the hotel with the iPad Air that is provided.    There are four restaurants at the resort, a Nobu, 140, a sports bar and a poolside restaurant called Malibu Farm. None of them are cheap but all of them have fabulously tasty food. They are reviewed under their names on TripAdvisor. Having said that, the room service is actually really good, prompt and probably the cheapest option.    The resort had a major renovation in the past year and the pool area, rooms, lobby area and restaurants were all renovated. The pool area has lush gardens throughout, private areas with deck chairs and two pools with hot tubs. Unfortunately the pools are both very shallow, 4 ft max, it also has a dark bottom. This is too bad as we enjoyed swimming in the pool and this is no longer possible.    There are hot tubs, private lanais, and lots of comfortable chairs to relax on up top.    The pool area overlooks Manele Bay, which is just amazing. Make sure to spend time at the beach, they will set up chairs for you as well as food... no alcohol though    You can snorkel at the beach, do stand up paddle boarding through a third party, swim or just laze around. Bring an underwater camera for all the fish and coral you will see.    Even though it rained for a day, there are a lot of activities that you can do, such as yoga, spinning classes, traditional Hawaiian classes.    Be sure to check out the beautiful gardens, koi ponds and the bird sanctuary. The gardens are just stunning, they take so much care to look after them. The koi ponds have huge fish, and you can get food from the desk to feed them. There is someone that brings the birds out during the day so that you can see them up close.    We went to the spa a couple of times and really enjoyed it. Totomi provides one of the best massages ever. You can use the sauna and steam room as a guest, you don't need to have a spa appointment. The spa area has been completely redone and is well laid out as well as functional.    A few improvements that could be done:    - service at the pool can be inconsistent, some are great, others need more training.  - bringing around treats and spritz at the pool and beach is also inconsistent.  - they used to have infused water and sunscreen at the pool, now that seems to be gone.  - used to have a small library of books and magazines at the pool, no longer there now.  - have a resort map on the website indicating room class and locations.  - used to have a small market on certain days of the week with local merchants in the lobby.  - they used to have locals play live traditional Hawaiian music.  - there seems to have been a lot of turnover in their staff after the reno, better training and consistency would be good.    Having said all that, these are minor points and mainly differences we've noticed after having been here a few times.    A few tips:    - bring some of your own snacks, beverages, wine to enjoy in your room. Prices are outrageous otherwise.  - take the time to understand the room classes.  -enjoy room service meals on your lanai, the food is actually really tasty and it makes for an enjoyable evening.  - take the time to explore the property, including the gardens, koi ponds, paintings and artifacts.  - use the sauna and steam room.

471639294,40,Beautiful hotel since amazing renovation - rooms descriptions inaccurate,"I have been to hotel previously before renovation and was very run down. Hotel has undergone complete renovation and amazing transformation into beautiful hotel. The hotel grounds. pool area and hotel rooms are beautifully decorated with fancy toilet and huge flatscreen televisions. The big issue I have is with the very inaccurate description of room views. We booked an ocean view suite for about $4000/night. When we arrived we were given room on ground level with a view of a hill of grass and other rooms. If I stood in the corner of room and stood up tall I can see a glimpse of the ocean. We immediately complained and told there were no other rooms available. After few days they upgraded us to a suite in the main building which had an amazing view but was not renovated as nicely as previous suite we were in. We had same issue many years prior with inaccurate description of rooms. Overall I think the hotel has undergone an amazing transformation, the rooms are beautiful, the pool area is beautiful. There is really only two restaurant choices on island and food choices somewhat limited. The hotel needs to change their room descriptions and rooms on ground level should be considered garden view not ocean view.

471511397,50,Amazing vacation to get away from reality.,"This island is so secluded. Only approximately 3700 people live here. There is no traffic to hassle with. No one to fight over beach chairs. No worry about anything. The resort is a Four Season so of course it is going to be wonderful. What puts it above that are the local people that live there and work at the resort. They are genuinely the nicest people on earth. I left feeling that I could be great friends with many of them. When you go, look up Cathy at the golf club, Maricel at breakfast brunch, Lydia at the adventure club and Sou as a breakfast hostess or at the harbor market. These ladies were our favorites but everyone there is beyond helpful and nice. We took full advantage of UTV riding, helicopter tour, snorkle catamaran tour and our own jeep tour around the island. This was a vacation we will always remember and hopefully will return to. --- You almost feel that you have the whole island to yourself, to relax and enjoy. My 13 year old daughter loved the vacation too!! There were a lot of families there.

471198844,40,"Loved Lana'i, but there were pros and cons","We stayed at the Four Seasons Lana'i for a week in March 2017, and while beautiful, I would say a week is maybe a bit too long. The property was nice, plenty to explore on the island during the day, but the evening/dining options were extremely limited. I also didn't feel like the value was there for the money, which I'll explain.    We chose Lana'i to avoid the crowds and mega-resort experiences of the other islands. We loved the the quaint island and lack of crowds, but unfortunately still felt that we were at a mega-resort that lacked a special or intimate experience.    First impression upon arriving at the Lana'i airport was excellent. We used the hotel's lounge in Honolulu (tricky to find, near gate 24) and were able to check in to our room, so once we got to Lana'i, we were able to go straight to up to relax. We booked a partial ocean view, emphasis on the partial. It was basically a garden view room and frankly should've been billed as such. The gardens were lovely, though, and we stayed put because we didn't want to put more money toward the room.    The room was nice and modern and you could do most things through an ipad. Where the service fell short for us was in housekeeping. We would be gone for hours and always managed to come back just when they were tidying or fixing something. Our room was turned down only 2-3 times. One night, I requested turn down service via the iPad at the same time as our dinner reservation since I knew we'd be gone. They knocked no less than 5 minutes after we'd returned for the night, 2 hours after the requested time. My feeling is that when you are spending over $1200/night, the service should be much more personal, discreet, and consistent. In our experience from other properties of the same expense and caliber, the staff does a better job of monitoring your comings and goings as to not interrupt, and often leave personal touches like flowers, local sweets, notes, etc. All stuff I can totally live without of course, but for the price, I just expected more. This could've just been any big resort anywhere, it lacked that something special.    As far as some of the pros, the beach was absolutely beautiful and not busy at all, which was perfect. The service both at the beach and pool were excellent. They'd bring by frozen grapes, little drink tastes, clean your sunglasses, etc. Loved all of that! Only suggestion would be to add a hotel restroom at the beach level. It was a trek down to the beach and the only restroom once you got there was the public park one, which was really disgusting, unfortunately. Not the hotel's fault at all, but something they could add and improve the experience.    The property basically had 3 dinner options - Nobu, One Forty, and the Sports Bar. The food was good but very pricey, and I didn't need such an elaborate experience that many nights in a row. There were a couple of cute, local lunch spots in town, but only one dinner spot that I could tell. Perhaps there will be more options when the next FS property opens up. I really wished that the restaurant at the golf course was open later than 6pm since the food was great and the views were stunning. Live music or something would also be a nice touch because there was literally nothing to do after the sun went down. Oh well, early to bed, early to rise!    All of the wait staff (especially room service!), bellmen, front desk, etc were super friendly and welcoming. The activities desk was less helpful/friendly, but fine. We had a daily credit, which was nice. We wanted to try one of the advertised snorkeling or sunset cruise trips, but the hotel didn't actually have a boat contract, so...those weren't actually options. Bummer. We booked our own fishing trip direct with Captain Jason on Fish n Chips, which was fabulous even though we didn't catch anything that day. We also rented a jeep which was awesome and convenient from the hotel, but of course, you couldn't use the credit for that. Still worth it and highly recommended to explore the lovely island and get off property! My husband went skeet shooting and loved it. We went to the spa a couple of times, which the credit could be applied toward. The services were excellent but the spa unfortunately did not evoke the Hawaiian spirit at all. It was just a white, modern spa - you didn't feel like you were on a beautiful Hawaiian island, and that was a miss for me.    All in all, we enjoyed our stay and the property, but I didn't feel that the value was there for the money unfortunately. I think 3-4 days would be perfect as part of an island-hopping trip to avoid the bustle of the other islands.",Mar 2017,March 2017,Traveled as a couple,Don't bother with a partial ocean view - you can't really see the ocean at all!

467671997,50,Excellent FS experience,"Wife, 17 year old daughter and I visited here for 4 days on Spring Break,March 2017, after Maui. We had a 2 bedded room, oceanview. The room had one of the biggest TV's in my many hotel stays, Samsung, guessing a 70 inch. This size in all rooms. The double sink and large bathroom a plus for our fam of 3. Rain shower head with bench in shower. Giant sep. soaking tub. TV in mirror in bathroom. In keeping with the newly rehabbed hotel rooms, the toilet was one of the new Toto's that had air, water, heated seat, fully automatic. Our room was ground floor and had a spacious patio with 2chairs, table, couch and spectacular pacific ocean views. A friend had a --prime-- oceanfront king, and his room was about the same size of ours, but was --dead on-- water views. We saw dolphins in the morning, and whale sightings in the afternoon. Beds super comfy. Could hear waves crashing on the shore to ease you off to dreamland.    Service was typical FS style. Staff to guest ratio was very good. Greeted by name or by Aloha by staff from grounds keepers to front office managers. Some of the hidden gems here.. Met by staff/ambassadors at pier and airport and driven in Mercedes sprinters for harbor or airport transfers. Of course chilled bottled waters offered along way. Upon arrival, greeted by staff with chilled towels, aloha drinks, and flower lei's. Luggage beat us to room. Nice stocked mini bar with free nespresso coffee pos and machines in room.    Pool chairs and views towards the Pacific ocean wonderful with comfortable lounges as well. Shade or sun no worries as the pool person will adjust.the huge umbrellas. During the days i was there, big insulated thermos of ice and water on tables by our chairs. chilled towels offered during the day, frozen mango popsicle offered, strawberry mini shakes offered too. all free. Of course, no prob finding your ideal chair. No need to get up at 5am and throw shoes and magazines on chairs. We got there about 930-10am each day, and the pool guy remembered the -ones- we like, and had them there for us. Tip,, yep I gave him a $10 each day, but this was great service. I saw some peeps give nothing, and service to them just the same. As you might suspect at the FS, evening turndown and fresh towels are done too. I tip $5 each service, but that is me, not you.    For food/drink.. Sports bar was good, 4 tv's. (70 inch samsung's). Malibu Farms is a casual but upscale poolside restaurant with excellent menu choices. Of course Nobu speaks for itself. The other nice one is their -140- restaurant. 140 means,, square miles of Lanai -or- the temp of meat prepared. ,, they said both to me on the restaurant name.

The resort offers complimentary snorkeling, gym (free bottled water & fruit), sauna & spa (free tea, small health bars, woman's essentials in sauna room) in the rooms you get free coffee, tea, & bottled water. anything else in the refrigerator is very costly, as well as the food there. They serve pretty big portions at the restaurants so you can share to cut the cost down. At the pool they have sunscreen & Aloe free of charge and also serve little refreshments that are also complimentary as well as water thermoses. the beach offer complimentary chairs, water thermoses & small refreshments as well. The resort offers a shuttle service to town at 11 am & again at 4pm, drops you off at Lana'i Hotel & you can walk around & see the quaint town. If you choose to not wait for the next shuttle you can take a taxi back for as little as $10. The resort is pretty expensive, so I do recommend budgeting if you are on a budget.

463054797,50,Mahalo Four Seasons Lanai,"Just returned from a week's stay at this glorious resort.There are so many elements of the resort and Lanai that this make The Four Seasons Lanai a world class resort:    1. The Island of Lanai.. a former pineapple plantation purchased by Larry Ellison of Oracle Fame. He has dedicated himself to it's people and development in a most positive way. Lanai is somewhat arid but has the intimate small island Hawaii feel that is lost in the larger Islands. More laid back..and accessible. The people of Lanai are absolutely delightul.. friendly and warm.    2. Resort..No expense has been spared in the renovation. There are so many sophisticated design elements and details. The finishings are deluxe. The decor is inviting and not overdone. The gardens are the most lush that I've seen. The landscaping is phenomenal particularly in the pool area.    3. Service is TOP Notch. We spent most of our time at the beach and the staff there, particularly Kris, were amazing. There are always chairs available and you are not on top of other guests.    4. Activities.. unbelievable snorkeling right off the beach.. no need really to go on a snorkeling trip. I particularly loved the Sunrise Yoga class especially with RAJ. I also enjoyed the many other fitness classes such as spinning with Molly which are complimentary. Though the island is relatively quiet..you can be as busy as you like. We were so in love with the resort that other than a trip to Lanai City we never left.  Fabulous golf! There is a lovely hike to a hidden beach cove.    5. Beach.. We love the beach.. and this one did not disappoint.. blue clean water..  lounges, towel, sunscreen, umbrellas, water provided everyday    6. Restaurants: Breakfast buffet was an extravaganza of hot food, tropical fruits, smoothies, juices etc  Nobu was our favorite .. but.. but only for their hot specials.. their sushi portions and seafood tacos were very small and overpriced..the brussels sprouts were fantastic..  One Forty was also very good..as was the Sports Bar..Loved their Tuna Poke..    7. Lanai City.. worth a visit.. cute classic town.. my advice take a cab in about 9:30 (confirm cab they are not always reliable and may have additional stops), bring a cooler from the hotel and go straight to Gay street to Lanai Ohana Poke Market.. a line starts to form at 10:15 and if often closes in less than an hour when it runs out. It is hands down the best Poke.. Then visit the The Local Gentry for cute clothing, The Hula Hut for island souveneirs..and The Mike Carroll Art Gallery for lovely scenes.The framing there is outstanding, using local woods.. Finally you can go to Richard's market and buy Lion's Kona Coffee and make it back for the 1130 shuttle to the hotel!    A few suggestions  - The beach lounges are not as comfortable as the pool lounges.. which are incredibly comfy  - The gift shop has very few items from Hawaii..which is a disappointment .Important to feature native crafts, art and products as opposed to overpriced beach ware..  - would have been nice to have some authentic hawaiian music or dancing at the hotel..

460959087,40,"Overall excellent, but pricey for the service","My husband and I stayed here in October 2016 for our one-year anniversary. This was my first time at a Four Seasons resort, and the fourth time for my husband. While I have stayed in Maui several times, this was my first time in Lanai. Beautiful island, very remote and quiet. Definitely a honeymooner's destination. We did appreciate how it was very peaceful with a laid-back vibe. Yoga with Raj was amazing! We did the sunrise and sunset yoga with him and aqua yoga on our 1-year anniversary which was deeply memorable. Food at Farm Spirit was fantastic. I probably had an acai bowl daily and my husband was a fan of the crudite plate.    While there were amazing aspects of the trip, I will say the prices were steep. One morning when my husband ordered half a papaya, it was $12. Needless to say, his goal of eating a whole papaya a day while in Hawaii led us to the local store where we picked up about a dozen of them for the same cost as a whole one at the restaurant. I had read about the many complimentary amenities while at the resort and found this to be a bit spotty. Service seemed to be available during a limited amount of time and many of the items we had to ask for. When we asked one of the women who worked there about sunscreen, she pointed us to the general store at the hotel where we of course purchased sunscreen marked up about triple the cost. Two days later, another pool attendant offered us free sunscreen...these are of course minor inconsistencies but given the steep rates, feeling nickel and dimed on vacation is a bit unpleasant. While I observed that at the Maui Four Seasons infused water was readily available and accessible to guests, at Lanai, the only complimentary beverages were on trays for arriving guests. On a rather hot and humid island, this was a bit surprising.    In-room dining was also often backed up as many guests seem to retreat back into their hotel during the heat of the day. But rooms were certainly nice and fresh. Our wristband door access was also problematic which led staff to have to come and reset the entire program, leaving us locked out of our room for a bit of time.    Overall, a wonderful stay though. Very different crowd from other islands as those to come to Lanai seem to seek more seclusion. I didn't notice too many guests chatting with others. Folks seem to keep to themselves which I didn't mind. It was just surprising. I'd think staying at a beautiful resort on a seemingly private island would evoke greater cheer and smiles of the faces of guests, but maybe they're just too cool for school...or worried about the papaya prices :)",Feb 2017,October 2016,,,"Portland, Oregon"
460801902,40,Hello Lanai,"Hello -    This hotel was amazing. For starters you aren't left with many choices on this island, you either have the Four Seasons Lanai or the Four Seasons Lodge which is currently under renovations. I believe there is one other hotel on the island, and others can camp out on the island (I think).    The Four Seasons Lanai has been recently renovated, and it was renovated beautifully. Amazing finishes.    We were amazed as soon as you walked in. The island is a real treat! It isn't over populated, and I only hope that it continues to be. The seclusion is such a different feel the the rest of the islands, and not many places are like this. The local people are beautiful people, sweetest as ever, and willing to make you feel at home. And these were not only those employed by the hotel, it was off site locals. They spoke highly of their island, and very proud of what they have going on there.    Highs:  The way that we were first greeted after being delayed for 12 hours was perfection. Due to weather we weren't able to take our flight over in the morning hours, and that resulted for us to be stuck at the airport for 12 hours. Keep in mind, that there is a Four Seasons lounge that isn't said upfront but they contacted us as they found out we were waiting. The lounge is nice, but doesn't offer much food selection, and the restaurants were jammed with all the cancellations.    HIGH:    Rooms was FIRST class, made me want to go back home and redecorate my entire home. Every detail was well though out, and I don't believe there is one bad room in the place. It isn't a commercialized over-sized hotel, therefore the cozy and first class feel is there. Very well thought of in terms of spacing, and navigating the areas. Beds were so comfortable!! Had such amazing sleeps there, and slept like a real baby. Don't remember a time I slept so well on vacation.    Service    You are well received, and well addressed by all staff members. The views are great, the coordination of activities were prompt and met all of our expectations. We chose the ""Love Lanai"" package which was wonderful for us as we had access to all the activities in one package. These activities are great for all ages, and all lifestyles.    Pool service was wonderful, the beach service was wonderful, the spa was fantastic! Morgan was my massage therapist and was pure magic. You have to visit the spa at least once if you can. Restaurants are great, One Forty, and Malibu Farm. Wasn't a fan of Nobu, as service wasn't the greatest and most importantly the food wasn't anything spectacular. If you're someone who wants to be active you will have plenty to do for a week there, and if you want to lounge and do absolutely nothing and catch up on some serious relaxation, is it an island worth travelling too.    LOWS:    Nobu. I've heard of this particular restaurant over the years, and it was a completely disappointing. Overpriced food, and not much of it. We were starving. We are huge sushi lovers, but the food was not as it was raved about. We were so hungry that we ended up going to the bar restaurant and ate another meal there. The service wasn't great either, we ended up waiting 10 minutes for someone to greet us at our table, and then another 10-15minutes for drinks. If we would have received our drinks we probably wouldn't have been so concerned about the time. There was nothing impactful of this restaurant I would stay clear of it, but you'll learn for yourself. And create your own opinion. Otherwise. everything else was wonderful.

From every angle at every time of day!  - the hotel never felt busy, no rush to grab beach chairs, no scramble for dinner reservations, plenty of activity options  - our Ohana Suite may be the best room we've ever stayed in, great views, 2 lux bathrooms, 2 massive flat screens, and electronic light and shade touch controls  - Matthew and the Malibu Farm team treated our daughter to an off-the-menu carved coconut ... and a carved full pineapple Mai Tai for us!  - the Stables team (Joel, Molly, and Mary) were wonderful during a misty but memorable family trail ride  - the Kids for All Seasons team were great with our youngest daughter, who literally couldn't wait to go each morning  - Terry was an informed host during a quick trip to Lana'i City, we bought beautiful local paintings from Mike Carroll  - make sure to take the 20 minute hike to Sweetheart Rock, we even saw whales from the top vista  - the ""Aloha"" rescued birds entertained us every time we passed into the lobby  - and when your hotel restaurant is Nobu, you know that it will be a special stay    Trust us.

458500288,50,Hawaiian Shangri-la,"We have stayed at this property many times over the years and always return because it is the most tranquil and unspoiled resort in the state. It has only gotten better since its recent renovation. The gorgeous rooms and bathrooms, with every modern technological gadget imaginable, are serviced wonderfully by a terrific housekeeping staff.    The property has been redesigned, and the 2 new pools are exquisite, set in beautifully landscaped gardens, one for families and one for adults over 21. There are plenty of lounge chairs all around that are extremely comfortable, although neither pool is very large and over holidays I would imagine that they both feel crowded. The pool attendants are marvelous and nothing is too much trouble for them--drinks, lunch served on your lounge chair, or any other request are all delivered with a smile. The beach is beautiful and the beach staff will set up your chairs and umbrellas for you any way you want them. They too went out of their way to keep us happy, bringing us lunch straight to our chairs every day, refreshing our towels and moving our umbrellas as needed, and always with a smile and incredible politeness. The golf course is superb and scenically magnificent--at $350 per golfer, very expensive, but absolutely worth the golfing experience.    Meals are delicious but we found the cuisine at One Forty to be overly fussy and since we stayed 12 days, we kept wishing they had specials at dinner. We ate most of our meals at this restaurant because Nobu was ridiculously expensive, at practically $25 per bite, a whole dinner could run $250-300 a couple and we did not think the food was that good. Malibu Farms is the most informal for dinner and always good. They also have a Sports Bar that serves dinner for those who want to dine with big screen televisions all around.    At the end of our trip there was a wind storm that knocked power out on the island for 3 days. The staff at the hotel was so fabulous that because of them, combined with the hotel generators that took over, we as guests were never inconvenienced at all which is quite amazing. This very expensive property is worth the price.",Feb 2017,January 2017,Traveled as a couple,Premier ocean front rooms are a 10 minute walk to the beach as the hotel is on a hill overlooking...,New Jersey
458348542,50,"beautiful, magic, restful, active, luxorious, peaceful, happy place :)","We spent 9 days at the spectacular Lanai Four Seasons Resort. The top-notch staff ( from the young woman who picked us up at the airport, Myra to the manager Rachael, sarah the queen of coffee making, becca the yoga teacher, jay and josh the beach men, randy and tony from engineering... ) just to name a few (sorry i left so many out) were not only friendly but warm and engaging. Having worked at a resort in a previous life I know how hard it can be to deal with ""demands"" of guests... the 4 seasons does it right... they don't like to say NO and they don't. Everyone knows your name and you are treated like a queen - amazing service and care.    When you book consider choosing activity credits over breakfast .. both are an option for the same cost when you reserve on the 4 season website. Many activities are ""free"" and included in the stay but a number of the big items cost - helicopter rides, trilogy scuba dives, sunset cruises, utv off road polaris, off road vehicle rental, snuba etc. The activity credits were $200 a night and you have a daily menu of fun to choose from. We couldn't spend the credits fast enough ... do it ALL.    Also, please take the time to check out Lanai outside the hotel - rent an off road vehicle for the day, have breakfast in Lanai City, and take to the country dirt road. You will find magic during the day. While in Lanai City stop in and say hello to Mike and Kathy Carroll. They own the MIke Carroll Gallery 443 7th street. And, of course, don't forget to support the local cat sanctuary home to 512 cats. If you are as lucky as we were you will be invited to a beach BBQ.

458341203,50,Paradise Found,"Following our wedding at the Four Seasons Hualalai, we stayed for 3-night mini moon in Lanai. We've stayed at all the Four Seasons in Hawaii (except Ko'Olina)...and I have to give it to Lanai for the top spot with Hualalai a very close 2nd. The reason for the top spot is 1) the rooms are gorgeous and modern following the renovation and 2) there is beach access in the protected cove where you can see and swim with spinner dolphins. I'm always impressed with the high level of service at Four Seasons - they set up a special amenity in our room with a beautiful chocolate structure adorned with our wedding monogram, plus had a framed photo from our wedding which even we hadn't seen before. We loved it! The attention to detail and personalized service are why we are so loyal to Four Seasons and keep returning. I appreciated that the room keys are rubber wrist bands, very convenient especially when snorkeling. Unlike the other islands, Lanai is still pretty undeveloped and feels more remote which I love. The concierge helped us schedule horseback riding at the Stables at Koele, which I really enjoyed (views were incredible and a great way to explore the island) as well as golf. I also took a private poke class with wine pairing - great if you like poke! The spa was undergoing renovation, so only my husband went for a massage which he enjoyed. Poolside service was great and the lunch was good. Unlike other resorts, there are plenty of places to lounge by the pool or on the beach so you never have to feel like you won't get a spot. We didn't mind the ferry ride in to the resort as it was daytime. We took the last ferry out for our departure, and would probably just fly next time. Ferries are not as fun in the dark, and the ride was a little choppy. Overall, we loved our stay in Lanai and highly recommend this property and island for a great Hawaii experience.",Feb 2017,November 2016,Traveled as a couple,,"New York City, New York"

The standout quality in my mind is the training of employees of the resort. Waitstaff, groundskeepers at the golf course, housekeeping in the hotel, bellmen, drivers and staffing of adventure activities...superb! I was astonished at how many of the staff called us by name...no mean feat.    Our room was among the very best I've ever stayed in; roomy, nice furnishings, incredible lanai overlooking pools and beach, kept immaculately clean and fresh. Well thought out climate, circulation, easy to use...even a powered shutter to black out room for sleeping. Nice minibar and coffee service.    The restaurants; the The 140 for beautiful buffet breakfast, the Malibu Farm locally sourced for lunch, drinks, and poolside service, and Nobu for drinks were all very good.    My wife being a ""spa person"" made two visits and was completely, blown away! My taste went toward adventure with a UTV, shooting sporting clays, and the best golf course I've ever played kept us busy. Recommend any of the adventure desk suggestions. They included transportation to and from all activity.    One thing that surprised me was how relaxed and un crowded this resort is. While it opened less than a year ago, it has apparently been kept secret...too bad.    Lanai is among the least populated of the islands with somewhere near 3000 population, most of whom live in Lanai City: general store, gas station and shop,and restaurants, mostly local service. The majority of the island is retired pineapple growing which has turn to forest and fields. The people are gentile and soft spoken, old school Hawaii. There were large numbers of seka deer...beautiful and graceful animals and I'm told there are mountain goats as well, although I didn't see any.

451857061,40,Great Family Vacation,"My husband and I and our 4 year old stayed here for a family holiday. First of all, just a word of warning regarding the room - we were initially given a ""partial ocean view"" room that had NO ocean view whatsoever, no joke, not even partial. As we were being shown the room by the check in staff (they take you directly from the hotel lobby to your room, as soon as you disembark from the hotel shuttle bus, with a nice cold drink and face towel en route) I noticed that there was no ocean view (it was facing an internal lush garden) but was told by the person that it was considered a partial ocean view room as there were glimpses of the ocean. I did book a partial ocean view room and was therefore quite disappointed with mere ""glimpses"" of the ocean, through extensive tree leaves. Then later when I looked closer I realised that there weren't even glimpses of the ocean, it was light reflection from the roof of the adjacent building!!! I thought perhaps my eyes were playing tricks on me, after all I had a long flight from Sydney and then the connection flight to Lanai but my husband and I looked closer and it was just the roof of an adjacent building and not even the ocean. I made a phone call to the front desk immediately and while they did rectify the situation and moved us, I felt that it was something that shouldn't have happened at a hotel like this. It would have been more satisfactory if the check in person who showed us our room acted and moved us at the time when she showed us the room. She could see for herself that there wasn't any ocean view but instead she tried to ""justify"" that it was partial ocean view room and for that they lost one star. So please be mindful of your room type as this hotel has many ocean view room categories.    Our next room was gorgeous, with partial view of the ocean to the west, perfect for the famous Hawaiian sunsets on our lanai which had a wrap around garden. I particularly loved the fact that there were screens so we could open the lanai doors and let the fresh sea breeze in, the temperature in November was just so pleasant.    The property was otherwise new and well maintained, everyday as we move about the property there were visibly many staff around the resort going about their duties and there were staff maintaining the garden everyday. I guess there was no magic as to why the property was the way it was. The room amenities were unmatched, from the high tech touch button lighting to the massive TV and the convenient iPad. We got used to all of this after a few days and it wasn't until we got to out next destination that we realized how good we had it at lanai!! It would be nice if the resort could provide a guest laundry, as being a tropical destination it would be practical to be able to do a bit of washing, and there are laundries at FS Bora Bora and Halekele so can't see why they can't have one at Lanai.    The food was fantastic at lanai. We tried all the restaurants, 140, Nobu, sports bar and grill, Malibu Farm and in room dining. We liked 140 the best but the others were good too don't get me wrong. I was really pleased to see that at a remote island resort it was possible to get great food, which was not always the case (we were recently at One and Only Hayman island and the food was really subpar). The food was expensive as many reviewers previously had pointed out but at least it was good food, O&O Hayman was expensive and bad! My daughter being 4 years of age was able to eat for free with a paying adult in all the restaurants except in room dining and at the pool side, otherwise all the restaurants had a good keiki menu (kids menu) with healthy options (not just Mac n cheese or fish and chips all the time like in some resorts). I thought that was a particularly family friendly policy and represented good value for us. My daughter wasn't able to attend kids club on her own (one needed to be at least 5 years old to attend kids club) so concierge was able to help us organize a babysitter for her through nannyconnections which appeared to be based in Maui but they could get a sitter for Lanai. The rates were $25 daily booking fee and $15 per hour with a minimum of 3 hours. We used the service and had no issues. We only spent a little bit of time in the kids club but it was well equipped and the staff were great. It was not busy at all.    Service in the resort in general was good and friendly, and again there were visibly plenty of staff available in the restaurants and at the pool side. There was never any issue with getting lounge chairs or getting shade by the pool. Service at the beach needed to be improved though, as if we arrived later than 4pm at the beach it was clear that the beach attendants were reluctant to put out more lounge chairs and bring us water and this happened most days, as we liked to go to the beach in the late afternoon. The attendants finished at 5:30pm and they mostly started to pack up after 4pm.    Overall we had a great family holiday at the resort and while it didn't start off in the best way, it certainly ended on a high note.",Jan 2017,November 2016,Traveled with family,Make sure you are happy with the room you are given as this hotel has many room categories.,Sydney Australia

449355528,50,Amazing Christmas and New Years in Lanai,The Four Seasons Lanai is spectacular. They did an amazing job with the renovations. The gardens are gorgeous. We had a suite and it was one of the best we have seen at a hotel. The decor throughout the hotel is absolutely beautiful. Everything is done to the highest quality. Haven't seen this quality of materials and furniture at too many other hotels. Loved how clean and well maintained everything at the hotel is.    The food was very good throughout the hotel. Breakfast buffet is the best we have had in terms of food quality and service. I normally do not like a buffet but the quality of the food at this one was excellent. The food at Nobu is very good as is to be expected considering the price. The service needs to be improved to warrant the price charged. We ate there several times and the service ranged from ok to horrible. One Forty and the sports bar were also very good.    The service at the pool and beach is outstanding. Food and drink orders come out quickly and tasted great. Loved Malibu Farms! Mesa and Scott at the pool do a great job overseeing everything. There are plenty of very comfortable lounge chairs facing the ocean. As long as you get up at a decent hour there are plenty of chairs to accommodate everybody.    We used the concierge throughout our stay to book activities and overall the service is good. There needs to be a bit more communication when coordinating activities but in the end they got things right. Just took a little more time to arrange things than would typically be the case. Many follow up calls were required to get things right. The attitude of all the ambassadors is great so with a bit more training this issue will be resolved. All of the activities we booked through the concierge were fantastic. We loved the horse back riding and private trilogy boat. The stable was beautiful and very clean with great tour guides.    The only thing we didn't love at this hotel is the spa. Very unorganized and messy changing rooms. Therapists seemed to be mostly new and not very good. The check in desk at the spa is a total disaster. Staff needs a lot of training. Given how over the top the rest of the hotel is the spa was a disappointment. After my first treatment I ended up cancelling all my remaining spa treatments and just did the pool side foot massage. Justin did a great job with these. They could use a couple more therapists around the pool at peak times.    The entertainment in the lobby over festive season was awesome! Loved listening to the bad after dinner each night. Would be nice if they added some Hawaiian performers once in a while too.    Overall this hotel is outstanding and we will definitely be back. We have been visiting the other four seasons hotels in Hawaii for many years and this might be our new favorite spot!

If the resort policy were to turn away anyone not staying overnight, I would have understood. But instead we were told that we could eat at the restaurant, but could not use the direct path to it. Instead, we were directed on a 20 minute walk around the property on the main road to enter the hotel from it's front entrance. It's incredibly insulting to be told to hike around the property like a second class customer for the opportunity to spend $100 on a simple breakfast, and I got the clear impression that certain customers are treated very differently than others based on staff's assessment of your willingness to spend. The property is beautiful, and the food and service were as expected once we arrived, but the attitude and snobbery were hard to swallow. My family has a long history staying in this hotel chain in other locations, but sadly, this experience was so disheartening that it has smeared the Four Seasons brand name in my mind and will certainly influence future reservation decisions.",Dec 2016,December 2016,Traveled as a couple,,new york

Received a very warm welcome to the hotel from all the staff. We were not staying there, but they were all very helpful and hospitable.    Had lunch at the poolside cafe. Lush gardens all around. The pool is a blue gem right next to the tables. Birds flying around in the garden and a view of the ocean that just doesn't quit.    On to food. I tried the ahi nicoise salad. Lots of fish, great olives, capers, greens and dressing. Huge serving.  My hubby got the fresh fish of the day, a red snapper on a sandwich. The seasoning on the fish was spot on, cook great, moist and tender. He says it is the 2nd best fish he has ever had in Hawaii--and we come here alot.

However, we felt the value was lacking for the high rates. Do not mind paying when very high expectations are met. That was not the case during this visit.    We waited several years to return to this property because we did not want our relaxing vacation to be disturbed by construction noise. Supposedly it was done several months prior to our stay.    The lanai floor adjoining the main restaurants and lower lobby was constantly damaged in the rainy weather and it was continually undergoing noisy repairs during our breakfasts. The bar at Malibu Farms was being remodeled and disturbed us with loud noises during one of our dinners. The spa was still being completed and construction workers were in and out constantly around the pools.    It did rain quite a bit during our stay and initially the hotel did not seem to know how to react. The bar at the pool closed and there was no towel service at the pool or beach. Some travelers do not mind going out in the rain when on vacation in Hawaii. No towel service and absent attendants was inexcusable. We went up to Lanai City to shop and heard other guests remark about “escaping the Four Seasons Manele!”    Many compliments to Sou at breakfast. Her hospitality and service was fabulous.

Our stay startet with a ""We have an upgrade for you..."" which usually means, we would not get what we booked. This time: Bigger room but not PRIME ocean view as requested and confirmed.  To make a long story short, it took them nearly two hours to get us into an adequate room.  The new decor is certainly high-quality with nice stile elements but the overall impression is dark and the gardens, packed with big plants and trees, add to the effect.  The rooms are quite nice. Unfortunately the three sections of the shades cannot be moved individually.  The two pools, one for families and children, one for adults only, are very small and almost side by side. The whole area is packed with sun chairs.  The service in general was friendly and attentive with the exception of two or three younger ones that were a bit too easy-going and forgetful.  We missed the regular shuttle to Lanai City respectively to The Lodge at Koele which was always a welcome distraction and offered extended dinner and bar options. Hopefully the Lodge will open soon again.    The price level was always high, but now the price-performance ratio is simply unreasonable.  The last two days of our stay there was a big group of approx. 300 people which of course meant that the whole place became rather crowded and noisy with less attentive service.

We decided after the first night that we wanted to spend more than two nights there, so we contacted our travel agent. She re-scheduled our other hotels and got a confirmation of our extra night. Room was paid in advance.    Very nice suite, with 2 rooms and two baths (for $1600 a night it should be); the place was remodeled just last year and the decor throughout the resort was beautiful as well. Restaurants were excellent although very expensive. Seriously do not consider staying at any Four Seasons resort if you have to pinch pennies. We rented a Jeep and toured some remote parts of the island, also did some sporting clays shooting.    All went well until the third night. We were awakened by someone pounding on the door, who was trying to kick their way past the privacy lock which we had thankfully engaged. My wife went to the door, still naked, to see what the commotion was about.    It was security, demanding that we open the door immediately. He said they had no record of anyone being in this room, that we were stealing from the hotel. She replied that we had a confirmed registration for our extended stay. He left, saying he would look into it.    We tried calling the front desk but the phones had been turned off. So had the iPad that was programmed to access various features of the resort. And so had the air conditioning, it was sweltering hot in there. We still had cell service, so we were able to contact our travel agent, and she contacted the front desk. They had no record of our extension, they said. Until she gave them the confirmation number. Then it was ""Oops, so sorry."" But they never did turn the phones or the AC back on.    We packed up and hauled our own bags to the entrance, took three trips. Rather than pay for their outrageous airport shuttle service again ($195 each way) we called a cab that only charged $20. The Guest Services Manager tried to apologize as we were leaving but it was far too late and far too little. We spent well over $6000 at that hotel only to be treated like criminals. Nothing like that has ever happened to either of us and my wife and I have traveled all over the world.    All they would have needed to do was call us on the house phone and ask us what was going on. Instead they chose to cut off communication and send the goons.    Edit: After my initial review Four Seasons refunded our entire room charges for the three days we stayed there. As a result I have changed my rating from a one star to three stars. If the incident had never occurred it would have been a 5 star review. I can't ignore what happened, but at least the hotel did try to make amends. Hopefully they have learned from their mistake.

439771460,50,PARADISE,"My wife and I had never been to Lana'i and decided to visit there for our Anniversary and stay at the Four Seasons resort for our special occasion---boy were we glad we did !  We arrived in Lana'i via the ferry from Maui and were met by a Four Seasons staff member and transported to the Resort which is not far away----that was when the magic started. We were told that Lawrence Ellison, the owner of the Resort and most of the island, had invested 200 million dollars in the renovation of the Resort and what a great job he did in doing so. Everything is fantastic : the landscaping, the buildings, the rooms,the swimming pools, and the beach. It is hard to describe in words how beautiful everything is other then to say it is a paradise.  What makes the resort truly outstanding is the staff of the Four Seasons and their efforts to make your visit special. A good example of this is Resort Assistant Manager Leigh Guillermo who met us upon our arrival and seemed determined to do all that she could to make our visit one that we would always remember---she succeeded !!  There also was a man named Bruno who was in charge of taking care of the rescue parrots at the Resort. He was a joy to talk to and shared his extensive knowledge of parrots and the island of Lana'i.  We ate at two of the restaurants at the Resort, Nobu Lana'i and the One Forty---both were excellent but pricey. The One Forty had the best breakfast buffet we have ever had, with an outstanding selection of fresh items expertly prepared.  Finally, I must say that the staff we spoke with and the residents of Lana'i City that we met all loved the owner Lawrence Ellison. They related that from the time he purchased most of the island and the resorts on the island he had made every effort to do only what was best for the staff of the resorts, the residents of the island, and to preserve and protect nature on the island----this alone makes me want to visit here again !",Nov 2016,November 2016,,,"Fernandina Beach, Florida"

Frankly, the hotel was tremendous before the renovation. I look forward all year to a week away on this beautiful island amongst the incredible staff and people that make it such a special place. The renovations were spectacular. We were fortunate to stay in a pool view suite. The rooms are sleek, modern and updated with the latest technologies. The in room iPad, new tech Toto toilet (I need one of these at home now!) and amenities are first class. Others have discussed the high prices of food at the resort. This is accurate, but to be expected with a resort of this caliber. The staff was caring, looking out for our every need during the length of our stay. Gerald, Bruno and Eunice down at the beach were amazing. Matt at Malibu Farm is a superstar and makes sure every meal we had there was perfect. Nobu didn't disappoint either. The morning breakfast buffet was wonderful. We did the snorkel sail with trilogy excursions (really wonderful).    Again, it is hard to find much to be improved at this resort, but I will list a few areas that management might want to look to improve.    1) More local flare at the hotel to make it truly Lanai. In the past local artists (Mike Carroll) were featured in the lobby. Guests miss him and hope we can get him back next year. If Mike isn't able to come to the hotel, please add more shuttles into town so that guests can more easily access local favorites like Blue Ginger Pele's, etc)    2) The gym is pretty outdated given the renovations in the hotel. I know space is limited but maybe explore expanding in various ways as it needing attention with newer and more equipment    3) Finally, with all of the technology at the resort (which we loved!) the wifi service at the hotel is very poor. I mentioned this to the front desk and was told they were working quickly to improve the speed service.    4) It was not explained to us that the transfer from the airport would cost $40. This seems excessive given it is only a mile ride (especially with room rates) and the cost of expeditions ferry. I think waiving this or better communication would be helpful.

439160140,50,Wonderful Hotel in a Great Location,"My wife and I just completed a week at the Four Seasons Lanai. Let me begin by saying that this is a wonderful hotel with an incredibly attentive staff (as expected at a Four Seasons) located in a perfect quiet ocean-side location that is somewhat unusual for a Hawaiian Hotel. While it’s not inexpensive, per someone who travels a good deal and choosing to stay at Four Seasons Resorts, One and Only and Aman Hotels, I can highly recommend this hotel. That being said, it “might” not be for everyone. However, I can’t imagine why anyone would not love this resort.    If you are looking for nightlife like there is on Oahu or Maui, Lanai is not the place for you. If you are looking for a huge variety of food and various dining choices, the Four Seasons Resort and Lanai are not for you. You are pretty much “locked into” eating at the hotel and a very few other restaurants on the island. They are not inexpensive and the resort could use just a little more variety. Those are really the only reasons I think someone would not be completely satisfied at this resort.    I hope I don’t leave you with the impression that food is sub-standard. It is not. After all, they have a Nobu on premise. If you have yet to eat at a Nobu, everything you have ever heard is correct. Nobu has fabulous food and service. The other restaurants are good as well – however, after eight days at the hotel, we (and my primarily my non-seafood eating wife) were just looking for something a little different.    The staff at the hotel, while not yet as polished as some other Four Seasons resort, is very friendly and genuinely attentive. They try, and succeed, in delivering fantastic service as well as making you feel truly welcome.    The location on Manele Bay is perfect. It’s has a world-class beach with an idyllic setting (you often get to see bottle-noise dolphins in the bay). There are no other hotels nearby (at all) so the setting, as opposed to many other Hawaiian hotels, is quite private and serene. We never had to “compete” for a chair at the beach or pool (it was October).    The rooms are exceptionally appointed and truly comfortable. They have been significantly upgraded from their pre-renovation self (we stayed here before the renovation). While the bathtubs could be a little larger, there is really nothing in the room or the hotels layout that leaves one wanting. The pictures of the rooms on the website barely do them justice.    In summary: if you are looking for a luxury experience, coupled with a quite, local experience, than Lanai is for you. I can easily say that Larry Ellison is invested in the Island and the people - it shows when you venture outside the property which makes this a truly special place.",Nov 2016,October 2016,Traveled as a couple,Avoid the pool rooms - too busy and not private,"Seattle, Washington"

438803562,40,Remarkable Reno,"My wife and I have visited this property a few times in the past, the first time when it was just called Manele Bay. The last time was a few years ago before the Four Seasons began their much needed renovation.  The new style reeks of understated luxury. The taste level is extremely high with warm modern touches that do not take away from the Hawaiian Island feel. The rooms have been updated with exotic classical art and contain all the modern features that in this day and age one can't live without. There are buttons for everything including one that raises and lowers the drapes and blinds. The rooms are incredibly comfortable.  The building and grounds have the same bones as before but have been upgraded extensively. It is a visually stunning resort.  The service, as at most Four Seasons, is over the top but in a good way. They all make an effort to remember your name and treat you like you really do matter.  I would have given this property higher marks but we did have some issues.  The property is still being worked on. There were workers in the pool area the entire time we were there and although they tried not to, they made noise from 9AM until 5PM.  We ended up spending more time at the beach which is fantastic but not very convenient to the rooms, restaurants etc.  The pool area itself is a little confusing. There are 2 pools. One is a ""family pool"" and the other is a ""tranquility pool"" adults only. They are realistically 20 feet apart from each other. Both swimming pools are relatively small considering the amount of people this resort can hold and they are both very shallow so you can't really swim in them.  My issue is that there is so much available square footage that they could have used in designing the pools. They could have been bigger and deeper, instead there are a million lounge chairs scattered all over the place. We were here in late October when it was quiet. I would hate to see what these pool areas look like in the Festive season.  Another issue is the restaurant situation. They have 2 high end restaurants. Restaurant 140 and Nobu, both have great food but both are incredibly expensive. The fact is you are a captive audience and have little choices. There is a sports bar that serves okay pubbish fare that will not break your wallet.  The other issue we had was the ""value factor"". This place is insanely expensive. We knew that going in. We have stayed and enjoyed many Four Seasons across the Globe but we felt that this property fell short of the ""$ vs worth it"" factor.

438628096,50,Amazing experience,"If you are looking for Hawaii resort feeling without the crowd, this resort is for you. Accommodations were great. We did not expect to stay in the room a lot, so we went with only a partial ocean view. Early November is their slow season, so the resort was mostly quiet. Views were amazing from the pools and restaurants, so we didn't need to pay the extra expense in the room view.  We particularly enjoyed the fact that the resort also provides a home for a few exotic birds that needed a home after injury or abandonment and treats them really well. Bruno is their caretaker and was excellent to talk to and very knowledgeable.  We did a few excursions, such as golfing, horseback riding and the UTV ride. All of them were great experiences.  Overall, this resort took care of anything that we needed, which was reflected in the price. Very fresh, island grown food was prepared to order and very delicious. Staff was exceedingly friendly and genuinely happy.",Nov 2016,November 2016,Traveled as a couple,,
438618806,50,Ultimate Luxury,"Luxury does not come cheap, but oh boy, this place is worth every penny. Any wish of yours is their command. While you're relaxing by the pool with its lush greenery and foliage, you can expect regular Evian facial spritzes, sunglass cleanings, and Johnny-on the-spot waitress service. Although the hotel was 2/3 full, it felt as if we were alone on our private little island. The adult pool, called The Retreat, is just that. And if you've forgotten sunscreen, no worries; it's complimentary at the pool.  Our oceanfront room was beautiful, and we loved leaving the sliding door open at night to fall asleep to the sound of the waves. When we return again however, I think we'll opt for the garden view room because EVERY room on this property is gorgeous. For all of the limited time we spent in the oceanfront room, I'm not sure the cost differential is truly worth it. But that being said, the room's interior and amenities are totally top notch.  Restaurant choices are limited (Nobu, One Forty, The Sports Bar, and Malibu Farms -for lunch) but nevertheless terrific. We never had to make a reservation and were always seated promptly and courteously. Poolside lunch selections come from Malibu Farms, but my suggestion is to actually walk a few steps to the restaurant and eat there. The atmosphere is lovely and the bar is beautiful. Al Fresco dining at its best 😀  Vegetarian and healthy food selections abound. You can even watch as fresh smoothies, with your choice of ingredients, are created for you at breakfast. Even if you don't golf, do take a trip up to the Views Restaurant to have lunch. Beautiful location to try to spot whales and dolphins swimming by. Food was terrific as well.  We are global travelers and always stay at 5-star properties, yet all in all, this was perhaps the very best hotel at which we've ever stayed. We WILL return.

437827327,40,"Beautiful, but....","Grounds are breathtaking. Service is superb. Decor is phenomenal. Sets the standard for luxury accommodations in that regard. However, a few things that disappointed us....    -The hotel throws around 'free stays' to too many people. In 1 afternoon alone, we overheard a 1) travel agent, 2) ""host"" of a (cancelled) travel tv show, 3)fashion blogger 4) sales rep, all bragging out loud at the pool to different people that their stay was free. Other young people talked about how they got ""a deal"" by using people's names. That made us very angry. We honestly felt like we were the only schmucks paying $1,000/night to stay. It also takes away from the exclusivity that you pay for.    -The food is painfully overpriced, and the portions are pitiful. We paid $20 for a small ramekin of guacamole, the size that you would normally put ketchup in when you order fries. I took a picture because it was that ridiculous.    -the spa is stillllllll under construction, and they hotel tries to convince you that they've set up an equivalent, and equally peaceful spa to compensate. They do not. They took 5-6 hotel rooms, removed the beds and replaced them with massage tables. No sauna, no steam room, the ""relaxation room"" is just another hotel room identical to ours filled with 4 loud women talking about how they are there for free because they said they were ""scouting"" the property for clients, and to add insult to injury, they are laughing and talking out loud in what was supposed to be the ""relaxation room"" when I was paying full price.    -the hotel has a Nobu, which I think was intended to excite people with the fancy name and reputation. They must remember that most of their patrons are from LA or NYC, and it's almost annoying to leave your city to eat at the same places you have at home. And we have to say, the Nobu in NYC is much better, many people were saying that.    All in all, we did enjoy ourselves and the hotel itself is beautiful. We did leave feeling sour, as if we got ripped off, because so many people stayed for free. The hotel must stop doing that.

Upon arrival at Lanai airport we were greeted by a very polite young man who approached us by name and said that he was there to pick us up and take us to the Resort. We were pleasantly surprised as I had not organised any transfers. During our stay we found all the staff to be very friendly and the service, facilities and quality of a very high standard and we really enjoyed our stay. Upon checkout we were asked to settle our account, I was surprised as we had paid for all our meals and beverages as they were consumed. I then asked the lady how much and what was the charge for ? She said it was for the airport transfers – I was shocked as I did not organise any transfers and there was nothing on the website upon booking that mentioned it. She asked me to wait a minute and came back and said that the manager had waviered the fees. I was very grateful as it was an unexpected charge that was not mentioned on the website, nor upon booking. After arriving at the airport I asked the other passengers on the mini bus how much they were charged for the airport transfer and they said it was complimentary. So it appears that if you are not a US citizen you get charged ????

431869704,50,What a difference 75 million makes!,"Our first visit to the Four Seasons Manele Bay was in 2012 prior to Oracle's, Larry Ellison purchase of 96% of Lanai, including the two hotels. We really enjoyed the resort pre-Larry, but it was a bit long-in-the tooth and was starting to show its age. Despite my career being with SAP, one of Oracle's biggest competitors, I have to give Larry props for the renovation and his investment in not only this property, but in the island and with the 3,000 people who call Lanai home. In short, the investment is very impressive!    So, for those of you who have been to the pre-Larry version, you might be asking 'what's so different?'. Pretty much everything except for the core structure itself. The rooms are completely renovated in tasteful and tropical woods and the bathrooms are gorgeous! No shocker that Larry has added a layer of technology to the rooms with mood lighting, motorized shades and of course, Toto Toilets. Our room featured a partial ocean view and was located on a ground floor, so our lanai extended onto a small courtyard. Very nice!    The lobby and common areas have also received a face lift. Generally, the change is just more contemporary, less posh-fussy like before. The common areas just have a much more crisp, streamlined appearance.    One of the bigger changes is out back. The pool area is totally different. The old Slim Aarons style pool is gone, replaced by a smallish tropical pool which is surrounded by ample seating and really gorgeous Tucci umbrellas. The main pool is seconded by the adult pool, equally smallish, but ample. My only real question with the pools is the limited depth. Both are only about 3.5 feet deep which seems kind of silly and kiddie-pool-ish. For 75 million do ya think a couple of extra feet would have made a difference? It's a very small gripe that should not prevent any happiness with the FS. We just thought it was kind of funny.    So, yes, you come to FS for the wonderful rooms and beautiful surroundings, but let's face it, it's the service we're all really craving. The expectation to be super-served with that friendly FS style that is unmatched by other hotels. This is one area that I'm very happy has not changed at FS Lanai. The service was good pre-Larry and is great post-Larry. We were very pleasantly surprised to see a few of our favorites still working at the resort. So friendly, sweet and nice and this sometimes can make a vacation. From the front-of-house to the back, we always experienced great service and we really enjoyed the fitness classes and instructors. The sunrise yoga is a very nice way to start the day.    Dining at the FS was superb. All restaurants are terrific! There have been some reviews stating inconsistencies...We did not experience that, rather, the food was very consistent and good. Is it expensive? Yes, keep in mind that literally everything must be imported to Hawaii, and then ferried to the less populated Lanai. What this staff accomplishes navigating around these logistics is not short of amazing. So, if you are paying a little more, a little more per plate/drink at this FS vs others, please just keep in mind how difficult it is to literally get food onto your plate. The food always delivered for us, so we had zero complaints.    So, this is a fairly rosy review, nothing major to gripe about and I'm pretty picky. Couple of things to note. Please be sure the call the hotel prior to making your reservation to see if any additional, major renovation projects are planned. The spa was under renovation during our visit and there were some general renovations being completed. I addressed this with FS management and was very impressed with how it was handled. Net Net, the reality is that like a home, there's always projects, even with hotels, but the goal is continuous improvement and desire to make the hotel great, which it is.    Hualalai remains my favorite FS in Hawaii, but that's not because the FS Lanai is a lesser hotel. In many ways, the FS Lanai is a much better hotel. It is newer, restaurants are better and the rooms are superior.... it's just my heart lies with Hualalai because I've been frequenting that hotel for nearly 20 years so it fits like an old shoe. Perhaps over time and with many more visits, Lanai will steal my heart. It's entirely possible.",Oct 2016,October 2016,Traveled as a couple,"Splurge, it's worth it.",Austin
431584793,50,A lovely stay,"The resort is gorgeous and of course, the setting is unbeatable. We've visited Lanai a few times, mostly day trips, and stayed once at a B&B in town. We decided to splurge this time, and booked a stay at Manele Bay - with no regret$.    We had exceptional service from (almost 100% of) the staff we encountered. It was evident that staff are trained to remember guests' names, as we were often greeted by name on our second encounter with any staff person. Very friendly and warm reception from the moment we got off the ferry.    The resort was recently renovated and although we don't remember the earlier decor, we thought they did a wonderful job. The grounds/landscaping are lush and beautiful. Although we ""only"" had a garden view, we loved the lush garden right outside our lanai. The housekeeping staff were great, with evening service also provided.    The rooms are quite high tech (no surprise, considering the owner, right?); in addition to the fancy full-service Japanese toilet, check out the ""tv monitor"" embedded in the bathroom mirrors(!!). Amusingly, right after I checked out (via the TV), the shades in the room were automatically lowered.    Manele Bay is one of our favorite snorkel spots, and this trip did not disappoint. The staff at the beach hut were especially friendly and helpful; likewise for the pool staff.    Based on our past visits to Lanai, we thought that the resort would be running regular (complementary) shuttles to/from town, however, they now only run one in the late morning, and one in the afternoon. Travel to/from town at any other times involves scheduling a taxi ride of $10 pp. It would have been nice to have known this ahead of time, since that would have impacted our plans for renting a Jeep. (But seriously, after paying this amount of $$ for the hotel, most other guests probably don't care about the cost of the taxi rides.) The upside of their discontinuing more frequent shuttles is that it enables others (non-employees of the resort) to have an independent (taxi) business.    Similar to some of the other reviewers' comments, there were (tiny) ants in our mini-bar area. We didn't bother to report this, as - being regular visitors to HI - we did not consider it unusual. In HI, we are always careful not to leave food exposed and to clean up crumbs immediately, regardless of the class of hotel we stay in.    We had expectations of an absolutely flawless experience, but there were a few very tiny flaws in our stay, which I've shared with the manager. They're too minor to post in a review.",Oct 2016,October 2016,Traveled as a couple,,"Sacramento, California"

430162035,50,Amazing,"The Four Seasons Lanai is the place people dream about when they have never been to Hawaii and try to picture the most luxurious and Hawaiian place to go for a vacation. Although I have stayed at several properties on other islands and several other Four Seasons, I have never seen such a dramatic, well planned, and executed architectural and design concept anywhere. The most amazing thing about the Four Seasons in Lanai is definitely the details.    From the moment you are greeted at the tiny LNY airport by smiling staff, to the pool, the restaurants, the housekeeping staff, and eve the managers, every single person greets you with a very warm ""Aloha."" I tried to walk around the property and see if I was imagining it, but every single person I encountered stopped what they were doing, acknowledged me as a guest with a smile and greeted me with their best ""Aloha"" and I was stunned.    The attendants at the pool (especially Kai and Gerald) did their absolute best to remember my name and my drink preference and ensure that I was taken care of at all times with ice water, food and drink from Malibu Farms and fresh dry towels. When the sun made its move and our chairs were no longer in the shade, they adjusted our umbrellas to our exact liking in the most gracious way possible. Kai made sure I was introduced to the owner of the Malibu Farms restaurant who kindly chatted with us about the island and plans she has with ""Larry"" (Ellison) to develop a fully sustainable farm operation to supply the restaurant. The food at Malibu Farms was artfully crafted with fresh and local flavors that were more enjoyable than any poolside restaurant I have ever enjoyed.    The rooms themselves in the Four Seasons Lanai are a whole other level of luxury. My favorite aspects were the handmade teak wall coverings and the use of angled lights that made the dark wood details of the bar, bathroom and bedroom even more dramatic than they were in the daylight. The automatic shades and multiple settings for different lighting moods were carefully selected to enhance every aspect of the room, bathroom and even the outside balcony. Our room was an ocean front suite, so each day we were greeted with the most peaceful azure sea one could imagine, free from any obstructions, manmade or otherwise.    Between the rooms and the main lobby of the hotel, there are soaring gardens and mellifluous waterfalls that cascade around the elevated walkways in all directions. The massive plumeria trees shower their sweet scent through the silky Hawaiian breeze and no matter how many times you walk between your room and the lobby, you will notice a different blossoming tropical plant that you didn't see before and be just as amazed as the first time you are led to your room. The grounds are manicured daily and there is not so much as a hint of noise from a leaf blower or lawn mower. Throughout the grounds, orchids are planted to speckle the green gardens with glowing magenta, yellow, and purple hues and amongst the hallways of the lobby and buildings, they are potted with spotlights hanging above them to illuminate their beauty in the dark.    Dining at the Four Seasons Lanai is an experience that is both beautiful and delicious. Each of the restaurants has it's own set of culinary masterpieces that are enhanced with fresh fish and some of the finest beef that you will find at any of the other Four Seasons properties. I had the pleasure to try each of the different restaurants for dinner, starting with the sports bar, then Steak House 141, and finally Nobu. If you asked me which was my favorite, I couldn't give you a good answer because each experience was as unique as it was exquisite. Additionally, the morning buffet at 141 overlooking Hulopoe Beach and Manale Bay with the dazzling morning sun streaming over cascading bougainvillea in purple and peach hues. Again, the chefs are masters of capturing the local flavors of the island, while ensuring that any allergy, health or diet restrictions are accounted for in their recipes for every guest. The servers are warm, friendly, and very knowledgable, especially Arnell, who is a literal encyclopedia for the island.    Finally, the beach at Manele Bay is the nicest, most secluded, best beach I have ever been to for snorkeling, sunbathing, and watching the sunset. The staff at the beach is also extremely helpful, knowledgable and courteous. They quickly setup beach chairs with towels, umbrellas, water coolers, and any snorkeling gear as quickly as you ask. The warm waters are teeming with tropical fish of all kinds along a very healthy coral reef and the schools of fish swim right past you as though you are not there. The gentle surf and protected bay make it an outstanding place to swim and enjoy the warm Hawaiian sun.    Our trip to the Four Seasons Lanai was truly unforgettable. I took well over 400 pictures and did not leave the grounds of the resort for 5 days until it was time to take the ferry to Lahaina and stay at the Four Seasons Wailea. My wife and I had just stayed in the Four Seasons at Ko'Olina in Oahu and were married at the Four Seasons in Vail the previous weekend. During our wedding and honeymoon, we were treated like royalty everywhere we went and were privileged to have such a spectacular range of resort experiences, each uniquely special in its own way. We had no complaints about any of the locations we stayed at, but we definitely chose the Four Seasons Lanai property as our favorite property of the journey. We very much look forward to our return trips to Lanai to explore the newly renovated property above Lanai City and to repeat the experiences we had at the resort at Manele.    We cannot express our gratitude enough to all of the individuals who helped make for such an amazing stay, but we can say a very heartfelt ""Mahalo"" and ""Aloha"" until we meet again.",Oct 2016,October 2016,Traveled as a couple,There is not a bad room in this entire property,"Denver, Colorado"

I love the mountain climate combined with the ocean. The people are very kind! The pricing has increased over $800 a night from its previous rate. It's lovely but I still prefer the old resort. Well worth ocean view room to have breakfast outside and happy hour in the evening! Enjoy the resorts pool, umbrella and loungers. They bring around cold Evian to mist you feels so good. Clean your sunglasses, cucumbers for your eyes, fruit bars. Lemonaide, water, .They do have a nice lunch Buffett for the kids. I help my self to the kids Buffett I love it. They are fine with it!

425811121,50,Secluded luxurious Hawaii,"My wife and I just came back from Four Seasons Lanai, and want to return already.  We stayed five nights in an ocean front one bedroom suite, and could've stayed a lot longer.    The hotel offers shuttle service ($45pp) from the airport to the property. When you arrive, you have your own personalized ambassador to greet you with a lei and some refreshments.    The view of the lobby is amazing; it overlooks the pools and Manele Bay and the lush gardens of the resort. The rooms are spread out over multiple interconnected buildings. As you walk through the resort, there a lot of secluded sitting areas nestled among waterfalls, the Koi ponds, and within lush, well manicured gardens. I would suggest you explore the grounds a little bit to find some secluded enclaves.    When we got to our room (2126), we were amazed. The rooms are thoroughly modern with beautiful interiors. Our room was a suite and there was a large (70 inch?) flat screen TV in each room. Lighting and shades were controlled electronically on the wall. You can even have your own music or movies play on the TV if you download an app. Each room comes with its own iPad mini, where you can look at the weather, order room service or just get quick info about the resort. Nespresso machines are included in the room, as well as two bottles of Lanai filtered water, Evian and sparkling water.    The bathrooms are just as modern, with TVs in the mirror, and a Toto washlet toilet. The toilet has warmed seats and bidet all in one. My one complaint is the about the shower. The shower floor is not flat, but made of small black river rocks. They are cool to look at but they actually hurt your feet while you are in it.    The day we arrived,Tuesday, there was a managers cocktail hour with complimentary drinks. It was nice to meet the manager and chat with the staff.    There are two salt water pools here. One is for families and the other is for adults only. Both have saunas and waterfalls. I think they are heated as well, as the water was very comfortable to get into. There are cabanas for rent and plenty of beach chairs to go around, with many looking over the bay. The staff was great and attentive. Food and drink come from the Malibu Farms restaurant.    The beach is also a short walk down a path. On the short walk, you will actually see some of the old foundations from a village that used to be right on the resort. There are some info plaques on the walk if you want to learn more about it. Once you get to the beach, there is a little shack where the resort staff work. They will set out beach chairs,water and umbrellas for you as well. Snorkel gear is complimentary. There is good snorkeling near the tide pools to the far side of the bay. You can order food down at the beach, but no alcohol (no alcohol on public beaches in Hawaii).    During our stay, we also enjoyed a couples massage. Currently, the spa is being renovated, so massages were being done in converted guest rooms near the main building. Morgan and Lisa were great and if we had time, we would've done another couples massage.    Food was great. There are five restaurants at the resort. One Forty is their steak house, and breakfast restaurant. Nobu, sushi and Japanese. Malibu Farm, their casual cafe. The Sports Bar, where they have some quick breakfast and open late night for drinks and pool, and finally the Views at the Golf course.    If you want seclusion and quiet while being in a Hawaiian paradise, then the Four Seasons Lanai is for you. If you want more resort related activities, such as hula dancing, fire dancing, etc, then this is not the place for you. We have been blessed to have visited Hawaii and all the islands (except Niihau and Molokai) multiple times, as well as the Four Season Maui and Hualalai. What we were looking for was peace and quiet while still being in Hawaii. I think this place is best for the seasoned Hawaiian traveler, someone who has done the luau's, the hula dancing and all the other typical touristy things.    We would love to come back. This is the perfect resort to decompress and relax. Thank you again for everyone who made this a wonderful vacation for us.",Oct 2016,October 2016,Traveled as a couple,,"Orange County, California"

I feel like I truly unwind here whether on a long walk, at the gym, switching from beach, pool, beach, lawn overlooking the ocean, bar, Nobu, lawn, bar. You get my drift. I must say the rescue parrots also make it fun and who can say no to Nobu sushi with an amazing bottle of wine. And they have the BEST poke ever and amazing fish tacos and salads poolside. And speaking of poolside, the salt water pool is mellow and calm and delightful.    I am BEYOND excited (clearly) to arrive here later this month.

425158052,50,Low-key Luxury on Lanai,"My husband surprised me with a trip here to celebrate our 35th anniversary. We were not disappointed. From the moment we stepped off the shuttle we were treated like royalty. Everyone was friendly and attentive to all our needs, from front desk down to the garden crew.    Not sure of it's official name, but we had a small suite on a corner of the first floor of building 1, facing south and west with a wraparound lanai. The views were stunning. I believe most rooms have ocean views to varying degrees, but the grounds are so lush and pretty I'm sure even a garden view room would be lovely.    The renovations were beautifully done, inside and out. I overheard a guest who had visited pre-reno attesting to this, and I've also seen pre-reno pictures. It really has a more ""Hawaiian"" feel now. The pools and beach area have a more natural feel, less of a big resort.    We'd read some negative comments about the restaurants, but we did not have a bad meal out of breakfast every day and two dinners at 140, three dinners at Nobu and various snacks at Malibu Farms. Just for a change of pace we took the shuttle into town two nights for dinner at the Lanai City Grill, which was very good.    We played two rounds at the golf course, which has some stunning views. More accurately, he played, I took pictures and drove the cart. My husband is a seasoned golf traveler and he gave the course his seal of approval.    Lanai may be a bit too laid-back for some, but we loved every minute. Returning after a day trip to Lahaina made us appreciate it even more. We were sad when it was time to leave.

423003314,40,Impression varies depending on what you want to achieve here,"We spent 10 nights. We have been frequent visitors to Four Seasons Resort Hualalai(Big Island). These hotels are in a stark contrast to some content.  If you want to have calm hotel life, Lanai is better. You can sleep under the moon and stars without curtains/suns shields. Nature is well preserved in the area surrounding the resort. Not so crowded in the pool space that you don't have to care about securing beach seats from the early morning.  If you want to play golf, swimming, gyms during the long stays, Hualalai is much better. Two swimming pools at Lanai are too small and shallow. Golf fee is so expensive like $350 minus for just 18 holes while you can play less expensive for the entire day at Hualalai. Gym space is very limited. No free laundry machines at Lanai unlike at Hualalai. If you want to enjoy jogging in the morning, you will likely feel frustrated as Lanai's resort area is smaller and still under development.    In conclusion, we enjoyed life at Lanai. The service quality of Four Seasons doesn't betray your expectation.

420850749,50,Perfection in every way possible,"Stayed here for four nights of our honeymoon and felt like royalty from the moment we arrived. Leaving here was without question the worst part of our entire trip. We were upgraded from the ocean view standard room we booked to a ridiculously stunning one bedroom ocean view suite. We were blown away when the door was opened for us! Without a doubt the best hotel room we've ever had the pleasure of staying in! But even in a standard room you will love this hotel because of the staff, service, and amenities.    The beach and pool are paradise - never crowded and always peaceful with staff always checking in on you and addressing you by name. Eunice at the pool was great on our food and drink orders and Gerald was fantastic as well. The hourly treats are a nice touch.    Breakfast at One Forty is phenomenal, but we did have it in our rate, so maybe would not have gone every morning otherwise. Wide selection of tropical fruit, fresh baked pastries, and entrées are made to order not sitting in bulk buffet servers. And the view is simply stunning. Ate dinner here our first night and really enjoyed our steaks. They comped two glasses of champagne as we were seated. Another nice touch!    I highly recommend doing the UTV tour too. Such a fun and unique experience and our guides, Fred and Leo, were simply outstanding. We decided to do this last minute and are so glad we did.

415063348,50,"Very expensive, but worth it!","If you visit more than one island on your Hawaiian visit, go to Lanai and the Four Seasons last. Otherwise every other place you visit will disappoint you. At least that's what happened to us!    This was my third visit to this resort and my 7th trip to Hawaii, so I've stayed a lot of places there (Ritz Kapalua, St. Regis Princeville, Grand Hyatt Poipu, Mauna Kea, Hapuna Prince, Hilton Waikoloa, Grand Hyatt Wailea, Outrigger Waikiki, koa kea, etc.) This third metamorphosis of the Four Seasons is the best. It's the best resort in the State of Hawaii, bar none.    The resort is Hawaii in a nutshell: beautiful beach, snorkeling, wading pool, relaxation, good service, beautiful gardens, Hawaiian artwork, fabulous guestrooms, and (disappointingly just) acceptable food. It's a very laid back place, so if you're looking to party hearty, don't come here!    If you leave the resort, a 4x4 is a must. The unpaved roads (which means most of them) are narrow, rocky, slippery, muddy, and treacherous. Expect to drive 3-12 miles per hour max. If it has rained recently, do NOT drive on them, because one slip-and-slide and you'll be calling a tow truck, waiting hours to be rescued, and paying for damages. No, I'm not exaggerating. It didn't happen to us, but that's only because my genius daughter was behind the wheel.    If you decide to go to Shipwreck Beach, make sure you know what you're in for. First, the beach is not pretty and is not swimmable. You'll take over an hour to get there and spend 5 minutes max there. It's not very pretty,and there is a disgusting and surprising amount of trash. There are no facilities going there or coming back. So bring plenty of Kleenex, food, and water. If you continue further down the only road, it eventually dead ends, and there is nowhere to go but back the way you came, which you won't want to do, or on the Munro Trail, which you DON'T want to do. Trust me.    The Cat Sanctuary is amazing. Downtown is pretty boring, but you have to do it. I wouldn't eat there. The places we tried were quite forgettable.    In the end, we planned it perfectly. We stayed 2 nights without leaving the hotel, rented a car for Day 3, and went to the beach on Day 4, leaving on Day 5. If you cut out a day, 3 nights is enough, primarily because the food is unimaginative though adequate and gets boring very quickly. If the food were better, I'd stay for a week and never leave the resort. I hope they'll kick up the food quality several notches to entice me to come back. The Views had the best food, although the breakfast buffet was really good while almost prohibitively expensive at $52 plus latte, etc.    The only mistake we made was going to Lanai first, because our Poipu hotel at $555 per night paled in comparison!",Sep 2016,August 2016,Traveled with family,,"Destin, Florida"

411384759,40,Relax and very hot weather.,"My wife and I stayed 8 nights in this isolated island of Hawaii. Not a honeymoon, just some time off.  The Lanai island doesn’t offer you much, as most of its vegetation is kind of a dry area. The hotel is absolutely different, in the sense that its gardens and golf field are very tropical…  The hotel was recently renovated and has less than 240 rooms, which makes you expect it isn’t a big complex. The transfer from (and to) the airport is very expensive; actually an abuse if you consider that the Van broke down before the first mile!  The room cost was way in the high end, and we had a nice view into the ocean. It was ample, clean, hi-tech, quiet and we felt great, …until the next morning, when the elecrtic black out rollers went up before 7am. It happened almost everyday. We were happy that it wasn’t a honeymoon !  The pool and beach areas are very well preserved (it is a public beach) and taken care of. The pools have a section for families with children and other for over 21, which is good because it provides you with a choice. Both swiminpools are too shallow and maybe a little small. At least, I would have liked that the adults one would have been more appropriate and secluded. Anyhow, the deck chair service was really great. The beach is beautiful, with some small waves that keeps you busy and they have all kind of sea entertainments and a great service attitude. We went to both and loved them both.  We didn’t play golf, but the course looks incredible. The fitness room is very well equiped and has an amazing view.  There are three restaurants in the main building: the one at the bar and the “140”, which provide you with good food and service, but not really outstanding. Actually, if you stay 8 nights as we did, their menu is not diverse enough. For a better dinning experience you can go to Nobu, the Japanese experience that I will not comment because I’m not a fan of oriental food. We also went for a quick lunch to the golf club restaurant called Views, where the view is ample and high but the food is basic.  Only two bad experiences: Housekeeping (slow and late) and the Expeditions Desk (allways was sold out).  As a conclusion, for the price we were paying, there shouldn’t have been any mistakes, …but there were a few!  Overall, we spent a great week.

It feels like you are the only person there sometimes. The staff is very attentive, and the food is very good.    A few tips for when you go    1. Get a jeep. The hotel will rent you one and there are a few places in lanai city you ca get one.    2. Visit the city and eat with the locals in a locals restaurant. They are more friendly and receptive to visitors on Lanai then they are on other islands in our experience.    3. Check out ship wreck beach.    4. Ask for a Mai tai in a pineapple at the four seasons. They are epic.    5. Go on a real adventure and search for the old club lanai. Just be careful to not get stuck in the mud!    6. The adventure outfitters have TONS of fun stuff to pass the time.    7. Snorkel or dive manele bay. Some of the best in Hawaii.    8.

The rooms were state of the art with lots of high tech amenities and a beautiful outdoor patio, the staff was amazing, the beach and pool areas were fantastic and the gym was great. The resort's restaurants -- Nobu, One Forty and Malibu Farm were all superb - fantastic menus, brilliantly executed, and with a wide-variety. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet and especially loved the smoothies and international items such as the pork buns. We also enjoyed cocktails in the Sports Bar and they we kind enough to share the recipe for my husband’s favorite drink. We were there for several days and could not leave the resort. After breakfast we enjoyed spending time on the beautiful white sand beach and would them work our way back to the pool for the afternoon and lunch at Malibu Farms. The service by the pool is phenomenal --- they were constantly coming by with treats -- cappuccino smoothies, frozen pineapple, mango popsicles, frozen grapes, and mango smoothies. We also enjoyed meeting Bruno and all the birds that they brought out to the pool in the afternoon. This is a fabulous spot if you are looking for someplace to unwind and relax. The only negative experience we had was check out as we were overcharged for transportation and the staff was not very accommodating.

404754836,50,Our favorite resort in Hawaii!,"We have been to most of the Four Seasons resorts around the world, and this, by far, is one of the very best. The restaurants are fantastic! OneForty Steakhouse is divine, romantic, under the stars, candle lit, and has superb service - I'd say its got the local flare and unique menu for those you want a truly amazing experience. Nobu is Nobu and is always a great option. The Views is definitely worth the visit, aptly named of course!    What I like most about this property is the spacious common areas to hang out in and enjoy cocktails, views, and relaxation. Most Four Seasons in Hawaii do not compare to Lana'i as the lobby area, sports bar, and large terraced deck are all excellent common areas in which to sit back, order a drink, and just be! Also the beach is white sand, protected bay, and wonderful to enjoy. The resort incorporates traditional Hawaiian arts in contemporary minimalism with a focus on organic, earth toned interiors, and really is a great fusion of high tech with Hawaiian elegance.    We have made this our weekend getaway as we live in Honolulu. We have been three times in one month because we love it so much! I highly recommend taking the guided tour with Kepa Maly, who will impress you with his wealth of knowledge about the storied landscape of Lana'i and connect you with the place in ways you won't get by just staying at the resort. Although Four Seasons makes it difficult to leave with how amazing the resort is, do venture out and get to know the place. You'll be so excited you did.    I love Lana'i and look forward to making this our home away from home.    Mahalos",Aug 2016,August 2016,Traveled as a couple,,
403519655,50,Almost paradise!,"We spent four nights at Four Seasons Lanai with our 6-year old son, after visiting Four Seasons Maui. The hotel location is outstanding - sweeping views over the bay, swimming pools surrounded by green and flowers, a picture-perfect beach. The hotel has been fully refurbished in early 2016 with a generous investment from Larry Ellison (who owns the island), and no expense has been spared - the rooms are fabulously appointed, with giant TVs, Japanese Toto toilets, lovely Hawaiian art touches, Nespresso machines etc...The overall feel of the hotel is of understated elegance - having visited several Four Seasons properties around the world, it is comparable to the Seychelles and Koh Samui resorts in terms of ""wow factor"". The service was somehow hit-and-miss across the resort: some team members were absolutely outstanding (for example, the beach team - they went out of their way to help us every day, even kitting out our son's fishing rod!), others (such as around the pool) seemed not too keen about ""being"" there. The same happened at the restaurants - I imagine it must be quite difficult to recruit consistent staff to such a remote island. The kids' club was great - our son could not wait to go play there, and the staff was very sweet and caring. Only downside is that it is tucked away from the main building, and it feels a bit ""remote"" . We tried tennis (thanks Ryan for the great tips!) and spent a lot of time at the beach and in the main pool (wonderful temperature). The food offer, although very good, gets a bit boring after a few days - perhaps they could introduce more variety. The lunch at View restaurant (by the golf course) is highly recommended. Prices are incredibly high throughout the resort...you just have to close your eyes and go with the flow! We did not try any spa services, as the spa was under renovation. Would definitely recommend to friends as an interesting add-on to a multi-island Hawaii stop. 4 nights were the right amount to experience the resort and have a feel for the island.",Aug 2016,August 2016,Traveled with family,We loved our ocean-view room,"London, United Kingdom"

403009920,40,"Excellent Resort, But Unfortunately Not Up to Snuff and Renovations Continue","We recently returned from a visit to this property, and I have a warning for you - the resort is not finished. The spa is currently under renovation and is closed, although they are offering treatments out of hotel rooms and the like.    We arrived to hear the unpleasant sound of jackhammering. We also noticed a wing of the hotel that is under renovation, although it is in the back. So if you are planning to visit any time in the next year, I would certainly look into the status of the renovations if you would find their existence to be a nuisance.    This property ought to be compared to other Four Seasons properties, and competing resorts such as the Aman. In that light, it falls short.    Pros: our room was beautiful, and the property is tastefully designed. Our room service breakfast was excellent. The beach at Manele is beautiful, and - at least for the moment - fairly uncrowded. The pool area is very pretty, and the views are outstanding. There seemed to be ample chairs, although we did feel pressure to arrive early if we wanted a ""prime"" location, which I really dislike. Once the whole hotel is open, I do not know if there will be enough seating. It will definitely be too small if the Lodge at Koele opens and those guests can use the Manele Bay pool area.    We could have reserved a cabana-style gizmo for $150 for the day, but I really resent being nickled and dimed like that in a resort of this level.    Cons: Construction noise and closed spa. The service at the restaurants was very hit or miss. Some servers were excellent, others really not so much. Moreover, the food at the restaurants was hit or miss. Nobu was excellent, but the other restaurants were not all that great. I'd say the food was average to below average. The restaurants are *extremely* overpriced. $52 for a breakfast buffet is pushing the limit. I understand that this is an isolated island, so I recommend the solution would be to make the resort all inclusive, because there really are no other options for dining on the island, save maybe 1 or 2 places. The pool is very small - nicely done, but small and really not very exciting. As another review pointed out (very helpfully) the black out shades do have a sizable gap in them, which lets quite a bit of light in so if you are a light sleeper bring your eye shade.    Know also that there *really* is not much to do on Lanai, and even the Munro Trail is now off limits to cars for environmental reasons. The best activities are the beach, 4-wheel off-roading, golf/tennis, and diving/snorkeling. We were interested in a snorkel trip, but it was only offered a few times per week, unless we wanted to rent a private boat for $3,000-7,000 for part of a day.",Aug 2016,August 2016,Traveled with family,,"Chicago, Illinois"

Not a resort for young children in particular. Older teenagers are fine. They have a sports bar with pool tables and table shuffleboards. The food is incredible with Nobu and Malibu Farm our favorites from home. We took the ferry from Maui which was not bad as long as you take the morning ferries. The water gets rougher later in the day. We actually arrived in Maui the day of a tropical storm and all transportation to Lanai was cancelled - both planes and boats. The staff at the Four Seasons called me to let me know of the situation and arranged for us to stay at the Four Seasons in Wailea overnight and booked the ferry for the next morning. Their forward thinking reduced the stress and disappointment that we would have felt if we had gone from the airport to the ferry and then found out about the cancellation. This attention to detail was followed through in their picking us up personally at the ferry landing in a Mercedes SUV and escorting us directly to our upgraded oceanfront suite. No need to stand in any front desk line to get a room key. Amy brought the paperwork with her and we took care of everything while enjoying the view. We rented a 4x4 Jeep and explored the island.

400454751,50,Where earth meets heaven,We just stayed over a week as a family at this re-opened Four Seasons and consider this together with the One and Only Palmilla as absolute top of the tops. Lanai is a very very private and quiet island which you have to appreciate. The set up in a beautiful sandy bay is perfect.  The resort is build of high end top quality materials wherever you look - architecture and design is fabulous. Thanks Larry !  The service is the best we ever experienced in a Four Seasons. Everyone is very nice and helpful. Thanks to all of you.  The Food - esp. the NOBU - is excellent but expensive. As a family you will easily spend over $1000k on food daily.  We played the golf course and consider is as the most impressive one we have ever seen.  The only downside is a missing lap pool - the only place where you can swim is in the ocean.  Due to a storm we could not arrive on our arrival date and the hotel did not pre inform us that the ferry was closed. Here they could have done a much better job and directly re book us to the Four Seasons Maui and we could have gone there directly from the airport. It worked out at the end but after a 24 hour trip from Germany stranding in front of a closed ferry terminal and spending 1.5 hours in a car is not what you ask for.

Service in the room, the restaurants, poolside and at the beach was impeccable. The resort's Nobu, One Forty and Malibu Farm restaurants are superb - fantastic menus, brilliantly executed, and with a very wide-ranging wine list.

The resort sits on the south side of the island, along a cove, next to a beautiful beach. It was protected from the 30 mph winds that were blowing up in Lanai City, so the weather was perfect for laying out under the umbrellas, and swimming in the pools, which were the perfect temp.    Loved the treats the staff brought around just about every hour - a frozen slice of orange, a spritz of Evian, a frappuccino shot. All were delicious!    It is breathtakingly expensive, but I never felt like we were being nickeled and dimes once we arrived.    The rooms are everything you would expect, spacious, lots of plugs for electronics, and the coolest commode/bidet! I want one!

392374971,20,Various issues,"It is an okay beach resort in a nice setting (although, having been on the site of the Lodge on Lanai as well, I prefer the hilly surroundings of the latter). It is a rather large complex so it can be a bit of a hike to your room from Reception if you are staying in one of the remoter wings.    Unfortunately I failed to get the level of service that normally sets the Four Seasons apart from other hospitality brands. After they make one pre-pay over $1,000/night, I think one deserves better. In particular, I would like to note the following mishaps during my stay.    - My package included a room upgrade subject to availability, and this had not been looked into prior to my arrival, despite plenty of availability in the higher categories. To be fair, after I enquired about this, the receptionist promptly changed my room.    - My new room was not ready, and, upon request, I was offered a courtesy room to get changed in. To my surprise, as I am there getting changed and half naked, another guest enters without warning as it turns out that the room was also being used as a waiting lounge for the spa (the spa is undergoing refurbishment and operated out of a temporary location). No big deal but I would have appreciated advance warning that what I had been offered as a courtesy room was in fact a shared area.    - My new room had lots of stains and scratches on the windows, spoiling the view. After I pointed this out, I was shown two more rooms to choose from. In the end, the room where I ended up staying was fine, but the whole room assignment process from the moment of my arrival could have been a lot smoother.    - Some of the staff called me by my name about half a dozen times in a row in the space of an hour, to the extent that found it annoying. While it is nice if hotel staff remember your name, I found this completely mechanical to the point of being almost farcical.    - One cleaner forgot a wet mop inside my sink.    - The aircon malfunctioned in my room and had to be reset twice, before having to be shut down completely (in order to be repaired after my departure).    - I found the breakfast buffet exquisite, but neither the 140 nor the Nobu restaurants provide dinner options that are good value for money in my opinion.

It was average food at above average prices. For a real treat, go to the Views Restaurant for lunch (Golf Course - hotel provides shuttle) beautiful views and the food was awesome. In town, go to Pele's Other Garden. It has a great lunch menu and wonderful Italian food in the evening, at great prices.    Golf Course - Absolutely stunning views on every hole. Even if you are not a golfer, ask the Golf Course attendants to take you on a cart ride around the course in the early evening to see the best views on the island.    Beach - The beach was great and the Four Seasons had attendants that would supply you with chairs, umbrellas and cold water. Please note that you can order food at the beach, but no alcohol is allowed.    Cars - You can rent a jeep onsite at the hotel, which is very convenient. The daily rate was very good and the people renting the cars were extremely friendly and helpful. You do not have to fill up the car when you are finished, which was a nice touch.    Overall - If you truly want to get away, unplug, relax and be pampered, this is the place to go.",Jun 2016,May 2016,Traveled as a couple,,"Keller, Texas"

Everything was automated, brand new, clean, and perfectly BEAUTIFUL!    I never opened my own toiletry kit - everything was provided and smelled heavenly!    The beach was beautiful and the cabana boys served complimentary infused iced water all day, every day. Bruno was a hit at the pool with his intriguing grass weaving and parrots.

He was friendly, knowledgable and spent time with us to understand what we like.

It is not the easiest island to get to as we had to stop in Honolulu and then take a small propeller plane into Lanai airport. The airport is small, calm and friendly. We were met by the awesome staff of the Four Seasons. who welcomed us with lei's and took care of our luggage.  A quick 15-minute ride through the Lanai west side and we found our way to the resort.  The Lanai Four Seasons was just remodeled and it is BEAUTIFUL! Located near Manele Bay, and right on the water, this is an amazing location that is so different from any other Four Season's that we have enjoyed. It is so peaceful, there are virtually no cars, traffic or noise. The beauty of Lanai and the smiles of the local people that work at the resort make you feel at home instantly. Everyone waves to you as you drive down the main road, and talking with the locals, it is genuine....they are so happy to have you visit their island home.  The resort is beautifully decorated, open and airy. Our room was spacious and virtually brand new. With views of Manele Bay and the pool, it was an awesome week of rest and relaxation. The service / staff are typical of Four Season's....excellent. They are all eager to help make your stay the best possible. The pool folks are so friendly and love to share stories of what they like to do around the island. We hiked a 1000-year old fisherman's trail where you can still see remnants of the old fishing villages....amazing. Bottle-nosed spinner dolfin's arrived into the bay and put on a show as they jumped out of the water and played....there must have been 100 of them! The golf course at the resort is available ONLY to guests and locals....if you enjoy an amazing golf challenge with spectacular views, pay the $325.00....you won't be sorry.  The food at the resort is wonderful, Nobu is located on property and the freshness of the sushi is outstanding. Natasha at the Malibu Farms pool bar makes one of the best cocktails we have ever had....ask her to use the Don Julio 1942!

All the staff at Four Seasons is what sets this hotel apart. The were accommodating, gracious, polite and they HUSTLED. They made frequent rounds for drink orders, brought samples of frozen drinks, offered to refresh you with face spritz, they came around to clean your sun glasses.    Malibu Farm is a pool side restaurant where I had the Kale Caesar salad that is the BEST salad.    The rooms are beautiful and they come equipped with an auto toilet that was the talk of the trip with the group we travelled with and the source of many jokes that week. It's just something that you just have to see for yourself.    One of the most incredible things we saw where the pods is Spinning Dolphins that visited the bay almost every day!    I have to say if we didn't have an expense paid trip, I'm not sure we would ever have gone.

The pool area is now divided into an adult & main (kids) section with new furniture. We stay mainly at the beach during the day, however.  We were so happy to see everyone again; the staff is first-rate and genuinely nice!! Nobu hadn't changed and didn't need to-1st rate. One-forty is better overall (menu & service). Kealani is now Malibu Farms and located on the opposite spot from where it was (the adult pool is there now).

It's easy to relax in the afternoon and the staff will take care of you. In the evening there are just a few places to eat within the resort, but the quality is high and one of the restaurants is Nobu, which is phenomenal.  Lana'i is a relatively small, quiet island.

The staff was very helpful and always made us feel welcome. From the welcoming at the resort, to escorting you to the room or seeing us off as we left.    The Lanai Resort is the second best Four Seasons I have stayed at recently, with the top resort being Bora Bora. One of the problems with this resort is that the nearest town is six miles away if you want to buy anything off site. Given that, the resort overcharges for most basic items. The cheapest diet coke in the resort was $6 per can and you could not buy packs anywhere in the resort. We saved money by renting a Jeep and driving into town to buy snacks and drinks. I always felt the resort was ""nickel and diming"".    We were given two free bottles of water a day. The Four Seasons charged for anything above the two free bottles. I suggest going to the work out room where there is extra bottles of water always available.

We truly enjoyed the beach and pool service and took advantage of the snorkeling gear they provide! The snorkeling in Manele Bay was so beautiful! We tried all the restaurants at least once and were never disappointed! I will say the views at Views were AMAZING!! My husband and I enjoyed all the food and decided Nobu was our favorite :-) We did venture off the resort grounds one day to tour the island of Lanai! We were lucky to have great weather so we toured ALL over the island and were lucky to see a Hawaiian monk seal at Naha. We had no idea how rare it was to see one until we spoke to someone in town.

366206372,50,Fantastic experience (despite a bit of nickel and diming....)!,"We've just returned from a 5-night trip to Lanai, where we stayed at the Four Season (the only option for lodging on the island, other than a small place in town, as the FS Lodge at Koele is currently closed.) The property has recently undergone a renovation, and it shows:    -Spacious, modern, and high-tech rooms, complete with large TVs, iPads containing all of the property information, and, yes, fancy Japanese toilets  -Breathtaking entryway with a sweeping staircase and full ocean views upon entry.  -Two pools, multiple areas for lounging, premium beach access, live music in the afternoon, and staff waiting on you hand and foot throughout the day  -Gorgeous grounds featuring lush gardens, parrots, fish and hiking trails (recommend the Fisherman's Trail and the hike up to The Views for orange margaritas, chips, and guacamole.)    The service is signature Four Seasons. Staff remembers your name and your drink after one day, and they are always present to help make your vacation more pleasant or offer suggestions for activities around the resort or island.    Food was also top-notch, although pricey and a bit limited if you plan to stay for a week. You will need to repeat dining venues several times. The breakfast buffet was impressive, featuring everything from house-cured fish to smoothies to brioche French toast (splurge and get the buffet at least once.) The steakhouse and Nobu were both excellent with beautiful outdoor seating. Lunch options were also consistently delicious, from The Views or Mailbu Farms, and there is also an upscale sports bar that serves meals throughout the day and can be a dinner option. The town of Lanai City really only has one good option for dinner, the Lanai City Grille, which was charming and very good--a nice way to change up your dining in the middle of your trip. A friendly limo service into town will cost you $20 each way for two people.    The only major suggestion that I have for the Four Seasons is to stop with the nickel and diming. Guests are already paying a lot of money for their rooms. Tie in a resort fee, if you must, but charging $5 in the morning for a cup of coffee is ridiculous when most resorts offer a complimentary coffee station in the lobby (we did find out, at the end of our trip, that coffee is free from 5:30-6:30, which they failed to mention upon check-in, so why not make it free all morning?) We were also charged $45 per person each way for our airport shuttle. We had no choice but to take a shuttle, as there were no taxis, and the hotel is in a remote location. Just include this as a service. There were also various activities that you'd think would be included with the room, such as use of the tennis courts--not a lesson, just use of the court. The beautiful courts were essentially empty during our stay, but there was still a $50/hour fee if we wanted to go hit some balls. Most of the fitness classes also came with a fee.    I think that there is a misconception that if a guest is willing to pay a significant amount of money for a hotel room that additional fees go unrecognized and don't matter. This could not be further from the truth. I actually think that they are met with more scrutiny and make you wonder why your nightly rate does not include more. Like I said before, I'd rather pay a slightly higher rate or a resort fee in the beginning and have these sorts of things included.    All in all, we really enjoyed our stay and want to commend the staff--in every department--on doing such a great job. It's clear that they are all very proud of their property and work very hard to make the Four Seasons Lanai such an exceptional resort.",Apr 2016,April 2016,Traveled with family,,

364503057,50,Where to start?,"This is our eleventh trip to Lanai to stay at this property so clearly we love the bay and the weather and the staff. With the renovations recently completed we were not sure if this place could be improved but the new changes are definite enhancements of the surroundings.    Pools!  Wow--- the new pools have so many private areas with lovely landscaping! Very very nicely done.    Rooms-- We never went here for the rooms before BUT NOW... WOW -- incredibly comfortable beds, totally quiet rooms, lanais with perfect seating.. great privacy with enhanced landscaping.. all the features like black out blinds and the ability to order exact timing of housekeeping were definite improvements!    Gardens--- The landscaping with koi ponds has always been lovely BUT the new changes make each area even more special with new plants and orchids and more private sitting areas... inviting, special and adds to the serenity    Service--- over the top in every regard... from check in where one does not wait in yet another line ( like airports, TSA, etc etc) but you are greeted with towels, lovely drink and taken directly to your room... great way to start... service on the beach with chairs and umbrellas and cold water and small bites... wow.. even a goodbye song with the uekele by the attendants.. totally divine    Dining... see other reviews but we did a private 40th wedding anniversary dinner with family on the lawn overlooking the bay. What a total absolute delight from the well choreographed service to the incredible sommelier to the flowers strewn about and lovely table settings... totally amazingly perfect and a memory to bind together our family forever... thank you..so worth it!!    my only tiny tiny tiny suggestion is that the bus shuttle service is uneven... we ""reserved"" a shuttle to the harbor... surely they can count how many people reserved the shuttle vs seats.. the shuttle left 45 minutes early when it takes 2 minutes to get to the harbor... sure you have to load and unload some luggage... why was this so rushed... breakfast opens at 6:30 and the large group having to get to the shuttle was not a pleasant way to end this totally marvelous experience... THEN they didn't have room for two of my family members!! who then did have to wait for a half hour-- we really didn't need to rush after all but when I called the night before they said''Oh no we leave at 7:15 sharp and if you want a later time you need to pay more for a private car"".. well my two family members did get the ""private car"" after waiting for 20 minutes when the bus was actually full-- minutia... we all got to the ferry ... we could have walked actually it's that close... and minor miscounts happen.. if this was really the only mis step I would say they get an A plus still..",Apr 2016,April 2016,Traveled with family,"the ""garden view"" rooms are fabulous... if you really want an ocean view these too are...","Portland, Oregon"

363977487,40,"Beautifully renovated... but, currently, a work in progress.","I have a bit of a unique perspective on the Four Seasons Manele Bay Resort. I, actually, worked there for over 20 years. I, personally, know the staff at Manele Bay, as well as most of the people on the island of Lana'i. I know the entire history of the resort (I started with the opening of Manele Bay back in May of 1991). I know the entire island like the back of my hand. I've hike, photographed, and explored just about every inch of it. I, recently, had a chance to stay at the Manele resort, for 4 nights... just after the completion of the most recent renovation. First of all, there is no question that the resort has been, for the most part, transformed by an incredible investment from the current owner, Larry Ellison (ORACLE). Curiously, very little was done to the spa while everything else was almost completely revamped. The spa decor has been updated, but the basic floor plan and furnishings (steam room, showers, etc.. ) remain, pretty much, unchanged since it's opening in 1991. The new furnishings and landscaping, for the rest of the resort, are stunning. Impressive, state of the art electronics abound throughout the resort from a gigantic big screen TV in the bar, to personalized iPads in each room. WiFi service has gone the route of many other providers... there is a free ""basic"" service that is a bit slow if you are doing anything more than checking email... a faster connection is available for a fee. Almost everywhere you look, you will be greeted by the very finest furnishings and art work that money can buy. If you have visited Manele Bay before the most recent renovation... prepare for a, totally, new experience.    Although most who stay at Manele Bay are not overly concerned with costs... I still feel it's important to note that Manele's current pricing, from room rates to tee times, is at the very top tier when it comes to Hawaii resorts. What you are paying for, in my opinion, is a truly unique and pristine experience unlike any other resort in Hawaii. There is no beach resort, in Hawaii, quite like Manele Bay. The resort sits, all by itself, on Hulopo'e Bay, which is actually a marine preserve. Jet skis and boats are not allowed into this gorgeous bay where Spinner Dolphins can be seen jumping and playing. Incidentally, as tempting as it may be, please do not attempt to swim close to the Spinner Dolphins. It seems that their natural behaviors have been altered, over the years, by well-meaning visitors who have, continually, tried to swim as close as possible to the dolphins. When I first moved to Lana'i, in 1991, the Spinner Dolphins would, routinely, come into waist deep water in Hulopo'e Bay. This is almost never seen these days... as groups of snorkelers and swimmers, continually, seem to push the dolphins further and further out of their natural behavior patterns. Remember that this is a resting period for the dolphins and give them some space. If left alone, their natural tendency is to cruise into very shallow water. If you love swimming and snorkeling at a beautiful, uncrowded beach... this spot is very, very hard to beat!    Manele Bay has always been known for it's friendly staff that, for the most part, exudes warmth and genuine ""aloha"". Having worked and lived with these people, for years, I have an intimate, first hand knowledge of what goes on ""behind the scenes"" in most departments of the resort. You will still find very warm and genuine staff members at Manele Bay, but they are, very much, as of this writing, in a state of transition with all that is going on with renovations, new programs and procedures. New responsibilities and procedures are being implemented that will take some time to perfect. You will find a strong desire, by almost all staff members, to deliver great service... but here and there, you may find a situation where an employee is trying hard... but might be a bit overwhelmed. At times, like this, just relax and focus on the magic and serenity of this place... everything will work out. Take some time to get to know the people of this friendly little island. I can promise it will be a rewarding experience.    There is a consecrated effort, by ownership and management, to focus more on Hawaiian art and culture... which is wise in my view. Why would you travel to Hawaii if you are not going to learn, at least a bit, about Hawaiian culture? You are going to find some great opportunities to learn about the historical places and stories of Lana'i... I, highly, encourage you to take advantage of these opportunities. There are pristine historical sites, on Lana'i, like Kaunolu and Keomoku, that are true treasures. You can find t-shirt shops and postcards all over Hawaii... but you will find pristine places, on Lana'i, like no where else in Hawaii.    If you are a golfer, by all means, don't miss a chance to play the course at Manele Bay. There are stunning ocean views on every hole of this amazing course... and holes #12 and #17 will, simply, drop your jaw! (see attached image) In all the years I lived on Lana'i, the present condition of the Manele Bay Course is the best I have ever seen it. I've talked to golfers, from all over the world, during my time on Lana'i... and many have stated that Manele Bay is at the very top of their list!    Food and beverages, throughout the resort, are for the most part amazing... although expensive. As of this writing, there are very few other dining options on the island outside of the resort. If you want a taste of ""local food"" you might try ""Blue Gingers"", ""Cafe 565"", ""Pele's"", or ""Tanigawa's"" in Lana'i City. There are, also, a couple of small markets, ""Pine Isle"" and ""Richards"" where you can stock up on food, snacks, and personal items.    To sum up... Lana'i is not a place you go to if you are looking for night life and a wide variety of shopping and dining experiences. Lana'i's strength and uniqueness lie in it's pristine beauty and peaceful isolation. You travel to Lana'i to ""let go"" for a while. If you can put your cell phone and laptop down for a day two and just breathe in the peace and magic of this special island... you will find an amazing experience. If you can't let go of the ""hustle and bustle"" of civilization and you need something, constantly, going on in your life... this resort is, probably, not for you.    For those who take the time to, truly, immerse themselves in this island... a magical and rare experience awaits.",Apr 2016,March 2016,Traveled on business,,"Smyrna, Tennessee"

361041723,50,Amazing and will only get better,"Our family (with young kids) had one of our best vacations ever here. And what is incredible is the resort is still undergoing changes and improvements and one can only imagine that Larry Ellison and Co will only make it better in the coming months and years. We came straight from Four Seasons Hualalai to this hotel and our family unanimously agreed that while both were incredible we'd go back to Lanai if we had to choose.    So what was amazing? I think you get everything you'd expect from a top four seasons resort experience but what unexpectedly stood out for us were: 1) the food at all four restaurants was incredible (Nobu naturally, but Kemar Durfield is surely a rising/risen star chef with the restaurant One Forty, and the poolside spot Malibu Kitchen only has incredible and fresh food); 2) the beach is gorgeous and an incredible place to spend the day; 3) the renovated rooms made them a place we wanted to hang out in (and order yummy food to); 4) the resort is the right size and conducive for all members of the family to meet other kids/adults and make new friends; 5) the golf course is stunning and really fun to play.    And all this while certain sections of the hotel are under construction, the lodge part of the resort is not yet re-opened, and the service (while generally excellent had some small kinks to work out).

The pool and beach had excellent service by the staff. There was a pod of dolphins in the bay. They stayed all day swimming amongst the snorkelers. We could see whales also spouting water and jumping. Almost like having an eco friendly Sea World! There are only 3 restaurants so if you are staying longer than a week you may get tired of the selections. Nobu is the signature restaurant. We had the tasting menu on one occasion which was excellent. We did several excursions, snorkeling, ATV trip and rented a Jeep for visit the remote parts of the island. We enjoyed seeing the island.

360097836,50,"THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY.","I am a repeat guest for ten years or more. There have been huge changes.    The Good    - Some of the new artwork is well considered, enjoyable and much better than the standard Hawaiian hotel kitch.  - Gardens  - Staff/service. I am always impressed when a hotel keeps its staff and am happy to see the same faces year after year.  - Beach, the best asset of the hotel, but where is the lemonade? Many guests miss it. As well as the pupus.  - New pools and seating areas around the pool.  - Bathroom amenities  - Food, always excellent    - MANY thanks to Craig, the guest whisperer, who, for two years in a row, was patient and calm in the face of my tired crankiness and impatience. And who helped me get to a nearby clinic in moment of bad health.    The Bad    - Pool/lounge area overlooking the ocean feels congested with furniture to me. I only noticed half of the chairs being used most of the time.  - Pool bar and restaurant closing at 6pm, I preferred the casual pool restaurant bar for dinner from time to time.  - Why do neither restaurants, Nobu or 140, have a proper system to accommodate rain?  - Getting the front desk's attention by phone can be impossible at times. Ditto reservations.  - I personally don't care for the slick room renovations. I preferred the softer Hawaiian style to the hard edge Hawaii via Silicon Valley style.    The Ugly    - The eyesore of a staging area on the east side of the resort which has bright lights blaring all night and where it sounds like airplanes are being constructed starting at 4am. Seriously, it is noisy, ugly and thoroughly not appreciated. And no, it is not camouflaged by the trees during the day.",Mar 2016,March 2016,,,paris

It's OLD HAWAII as far as low-tourism and secluded....staff is excellent, gracious and accommodating.  It was a REAL TREAT being our first time there, we have been to all the other islands and lived on OAHU in the 80's, been back several time to Big Island, Oahu, and really prefer low tourism places....the rooms were out of this world spacious, ZEN and perfect. Loved the lighting choices, and the BATHROOM is the perfect retreat for cleansing and relaxing.  The BEACH is amazing....this was the kind of vacay we didn't want to trek everywhere...so we mostly stayed around the resort, and trekked one day to Lanai City......so cute and quaint and truly Old Hawaii. The coastlines and views are spectacular. Just sooooo healing .......Loved the food (tho pricey) it was so delicious as well as the presentation.  Swimming with the dolphins one day (they have complimentary snorkel gear) was one of the highlights of our trip.....my husband squealed in delight when 50 of them swam under us with babies!!!!! Total organic-natural.....They staff on the beach were so lovely and accomodating.  Auntie Irene and Uncle Bully who came most days to do Hawaiian Arts with us...ukulele, lei-making-palm weaving, etc. were MY absolute fav besides the beach daily. They made us some beautiful lei's and weavings to take home....truly would not be an experience without having this local couple come in to teach.  Hawaii was our FIRST HOME we made after we got married, so the islands are very special to us.  The STAFF really made our trip so beautiful, in the setting that was chosen to have this resort.

There are some excellent hikes just off the beach. A good variety of food choices with four locations to eat. The view from the room was great (made working from the patio relaxing).

358486379,50,Absolute paradise!,"We we lucky enough to stay at this beautiful resort for 9 nights in early February. My husband and I had planned a dream trip to the Caribbean for our ""babymoon"" which we had to cancel 2 weeks before we were due to leave. With the help of our travel agent, we quickly booked a new trip to the Four Seasons Lana'i and had no idea it was going to be fresh out of a major renovation when we booked it!    What an incredible place!! There was truly not one detail that was missed. We felt like royalty from the moment we stepped off the plane. The entire staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating. We were greeted by several staff and beautiful fresh leis when we arrived. We were surprised with an upgraded room with a spectacular view of the bay!    The room was just stunning! We loved the decor which felt like we were perpetually in an exotic spa. The toilet might be the most high-tech toilet we have ever seen! Not a detail was missed in the room - the bed and pillows were unbelievably comfortable. The balcony was large and a favorite place for us to sip our coffee and watch the sunrise. The bathroom was huge and truly a work of art!    The entire resort was stunning! The views from the lobby are unbelievable. The pool area was beautifully landscaped and had lots of seating options.    We were attracted to the resort to begin with because of the bay and we were NOT disappointed! The beach attendants were the friendliest and made some great suggestions for things to do and places to go! They guided us to some incredible snorkeling on the reefs on either side of the bay. We saw sea turtles, sea urchins, octopus and some beautiful fish - it was like being in an aquarium every day! We were also joined by a large pod of spinner dolphins on a few days and one day they even came up to us and swam all around and under us for several minutes! It was incredible! We also watched several whales blowing and breaching just outside of the bay. The staff kept us hydrated with personal water coolers which they kept filled all day and they came around regularly with lots of fresh fruit. Complimentary sunscreen, snorkels and beach toys were offered in addition to the loungers and towels. We spent every single day on the beach and never wanted to leave!    We enjoyed breakfast from the coffee shop after our morning hikes or workouts. We did splurge on the breakfast buffet from One Forty on two mornings and it was SO good! The fresh smoothies, omelet bar and pastries were amazing and you could also order items from the menu like waffles and pancakes which came in smaller portions when ordered as part of the buffet which was perfect. It's expensive but if you have an appetite then it's worth it! We also enjoyed lunch from the poolside restaurant almost every day. After a few days we learned that we could order lunch to the beach, delivered right to our beach chair! It was perfect and became part of our daily routine. The burger, grilled cheese and sushi were favorites!    We were probably a bit atypical in that we went into town for dinner most nights. We enjoy leaving property to immerse in the culture and environment and got some great recommendations on places to go from the staff. The restaurants in town were very laid back but the food was all outstanding! Our most favorite was Lana'i City Grille which had the BEST truffle Mac & Cheese I've ever had in my life! The prices at the restaurants in town were much more reasonable and it also offered us some more options other than Asian/sushi or steak available on property at Nobu and One Forty or fancy bar food at the Sports Bar. The hotel does not offer a shuttle into town but they can provide contact info for a car service which was $20pp round trip which we thought was worth it (and still ended up being cheaper than doing dinner on property every night).    We did enjoy a fantastic dinner at One Forty one night and would absolutely recommend eating there at least once! We had two dinners at the Sports Bar and we enjoyed the laid back atmosphere and the food was good as well although pricey for what it was. Given that I am pregnant, we did not go to Nobu as the non-raw options were limited.    Overall, we thought the food on property was good but more overpriced than it should have been. Orange juice for $10 and frozen grapes for $16 is just crazy! Ideally there also would have been another type of food available for dinner - Italian or French inspired perhaps? We realize most people probably don't stay at the resort for as long as we did and we certainly weren't expecting a low-budget trip, but we do think the food prices should be re-evaluated and perhaps some lower cost options should be added to the menus as well.    It seemed that most of the other guests never left their rooms or the pool area and they were truly missing out! The hike along the Fisherman's Trail is no walk in the park but the views are unbelievable! The beach and snorkeling were some of the best we have ever experienced! There's not much in town but there are a few tiny but delicious restaurants to try and the drivers for the car service are a wealth of information about the island - we learned so much just by talking to them!    We had an incredible stay at this resort and would absolutely recommend it to others and would love to come back some day!

The pools are nice, the one we hung out at was the one with the waterfall. Service pool side was great with Tai, and Scott Baker.

Nicely landscaped pool area with lots of loungers and umbrellas but as the sun moves, it is difficult to get enough shade as the loungers are very close together.

Our original plan was to go somewhere else, but when we saw rain in the forecast we decided on a quick change.    We arrived at the Lanai airport and the hotel staff was there waiting for us. We took the shuttle back to the hotel. We were greeting with many staff and walked to our room by a very nice staff person. We were lucky to get an ocean view upgrade for free. We were very excited about that.    We noticed the grounds and gardens are absolutely stunning. They did such a great job with the remodel. Our room was great as well. We were in a King Accessible Room with an Ocean View. (My husband is in a wheelchair). The only issue with the room was that bed was too high for an accessible room. It made it difficult for my husband to get in and out of bed. We did manage, but it would have been nice had the bed been a little lower. That being said, the rooms are amazing. Large TV, wonderful deck with ocean views (we saw whales and dolphins during our stay) and large bathroom.    The pool area is great. The pools are a little small, but the poolside service was wonderful. Our favorite attendant was Ditto, by the way. Sweet guy and very helpful. Sadly, it was really windy for a lot of our stay and we were not able to put the umbrellas up. No fault of the resort. So finding a shady spot was sometimes difficult. It's a bit of a walk to the beach, but it's nice exercise. We did find a shady spot down by the beach in the grass under some palm trees.    The only downside of this hotel is there really aren't a ton of food options. The food is good, but quite pricey. There really isn't any other option than eating at the hotel. So be prepared to spend at least 250-350 per day (for two people) on food. The food is good, but I wish we had more options at the hotel. They close the grill at the pool fairly early, so you either have to eat at one of three restaurants. I was pregnant so that eliminated the sushi restaurant for us. So we basically had two options for dinner for a week. We did, however, really enjoy the food. It was quite good.    All in all, we had a wonderful stay. The staff was great. The food was good. The scenery was great. Just what my husband and I needed.

On your way to Lanai, you are kindly greeted at the Honolulu airport in the private lounge from the Four Seasons. You can have your way with the some snacks, drinks and wifi as you wait for your next connecting flight to paradise.    Once you arrive you can see that a lot of money was invested renovating this property from the wood floors to the main pool. I stayed in an incredible breath-taking ocean front suite. This room had amenities beyond belief. From the well stocked mini bar to the suite wide oceanfront sliders to the automatic shades with a control panel to the 70 inch (yes I said 70 inch) flat screen in the bedroom and living room to the Japanese wooden soaking tub and yes to the spaceship like toilet.    You will see once you are there that this place is an exclusive couples get away although the resort is very kid friendly. Lot of foliage and jungle like features as you walk to your suite. Don't ask how much it cost. Money is no object here. They have a very cool radio frequency room key that is bracelet. No more are the days of demagnetizing your key with your phone.    I highly recommend eating breakfast at a restaurant called 140. That is the name of their steakhouse which is used for breakfast. A very wide selection of foods to choose from that has American, Asian and European style choices of food. I ate so much at breakfast I didn't need lunch. Please keep in mind you will spend about +$60 per person for breakfast but worth every penny, lire, pound or shekel!    Later in the evening you can dine at several restaurants. I chose Nobu for two nights in the row. I don't think I need to say any more about this place besides get wagyu beef cooked on lava rocks, get the miso glazed black cod and the spicy rock shrimp. You will be highly satisfied.    The golf is also amazing.

354409572,50,Can't Wait to Come Back Next Year!,"We first visited this resort about a year and a half ago on a day trip from Maui. We fell in love with it, and couldn’t wait to book a stay. We waited for the renovations to be completed and it was absolutely worth it. The remodeled resort is amazing! The lobby has this stunning 18th century canoe in it. It’s so beautiful at night. The whole lobby just glows. Our room (we booked a suite) was fantastic - so spacious and luxurious. There's a tablet in the room that allowed you to do everything from room service to contacting the concierge. Our room came with two bathrooms. In the master bath, there was a Japanese soaking tub – perfect after a long day of exploring the island. The room key is a rubber wristband/bracelet with a chip in it. No more searching for the room key card. I love this idea.    We also went up to the restaurant Views at the Challenge. You must go there. The views are truly spectacular and the food is delicious. The resort has a shuttle that will take you there and back.    The staff was wonderful and attentive. I got sick during one day of our stay and when the breakfast staff heard I was under the weather, they sent tea to our room with a get well soon note. What great service!    I’d also like to give a special call out to one of their team members, Bruno. He’s the caretaker for the rescue birds on the resort. Bruno is great! Not only is he fantastic with the birds, but he embodies the true Hawaiian aloha spirit. One day we mentioned to Bruno that we were heading into town later in the afternoon and he so graciously offered us a ride. We accepted and had a great time learning the history of the island from Bruno. He’s a fantastic hospitality ambassador for the hotel.    The only drawback was dinner at Nobu. Service was not the Four Seasons standard that night. It took 15 minutes before anyone asked us what we would like to drink and to show us the menu. Also the staff seemed to be in such a rush, even though the restaurant was barely half full. On the way out, none of the staff acknowledge our leaving or said ‘good night’. Perhaps it was just an off night for them.    Overall, I love this resort and the island. I can’t wait to come back next year.

So our check-in / check-out was anticipated. The staff seemed to anticipate our every desire. The room with ocean view was flawless. I really enjoyed the wall-mounted Samsung 75'' UHD TV. We ate at NOBU's and were served NOBU's appetizers pool side. We wanted to rent a jeep to visit the Beaches, but found there was more than enough to keep us busy. The spa, ocean view fitness center, the beach and more dolphins than I could count. Great place to go out to scuba dive, or snorkel. You can also take a ferry for a Maui day trip.

353666226,50,SERVICE is the BEST!,"PROS- If you travel via Island Air out of Honolulu you have access to the Four Season Lounge in the terminal. There they have complimentary drinks and snacks, and they give you a bag before you board to take some with you. FILL THIS UP, pack to the max, you will not regret it! Service was outstanding, everyone always said Aloha in passing or greeted you by name. You can ask the front desk for fish food to feed the koi fish in the ponds. The Room was fantastic except for two things, we got upgraded upon check-in to an ocean view room, however it was handicap accessible, so we didn't have a walk in shower or the really fancy toilet that I read about, but the view was worth it, because each day we could see Dolphins in the bay. The birds on property talk to you as you walk by which is neat. Upon arrival you are greeted with a cool towel, drink, and lei. Besides the outstanding service, the technology in the room was AWESOME, push of a button for different levels of light and shades. The tablet in room was how you ordered room service,requested toiletries, and room cleaning. The grounds were absolutely stunning, waterfalls, ponds, flowers, and fish at every turn.    CONS-The website states that the pool and beach have sunscreen, fruit, and popsicles. The did have sun screen but it was SPF30 and came in a tiny tube, so it was kind of hard to get on. The complimentary fruit and Popsicles are only for the summer months we were told. Food was great I would give an 8.5/10 for quality, the only thing was that some things could have used more salt. (I usually prefer things slightly under seasoned so if I think it needs more that is saying something) You can order food at the beach, but they don't have their own kitchen so everything has to brought down, and by the time we got our food it was already cold. So eat before or after. They offer a complementary shuttle from the hotel to the city @ 11 and 4pm, that's it. So if you want to eat in town I would suggest taking the 4pm shuttle an then walking around town for a little bit before the restaurant opens at 5pm (Lanai city grille) To get back to the hotel you would take the taxi which is $10pp one way. Even with the added cost of a return trip if you eat in town you will be saving money anyway. I think they do this on purpose so that you are somewhat forced to eat at the hotel. Food/Drink prices were quite high at the resort. I understand that things are generally more expensive in HI, and I the quality of the meals were good, however how can the hotel charge $28 for a burger and fries when the Lanai City Grille at Hotel Lanai in town charges $16 and the quality is the same? $8 for bagel and cream cheese? $5 for a can of coke? REALLY?    Suggestions for saving some money. Your first day there take the shuttle to town (you have to make reservations at front desk) and buy pastries at blue ginger café, if you ask them nicely you can ask them to wrap each pastry in plastic wrap. This can be your breakfast each day at the hotel with the coffee in your room. Next go to Richards Market across the street and pick up things to drink, wine, and snacks. Eat in town when you can by taking the 4pm shuttle, and make reservations for Lanai City Grille (they are open Wed-Sunday)",Mar 2016,February 2016,Traveled as a couple,Handicap accessible rooms don't have walk-in shower or fancy toilet,

They set up your chairs, towels, umbrellas and ice cold waster jugs. Free snorkel equipment. Clean public bathrooms. They couldn't do enough for us. The gift shops are nothing special. I would like more local wares available and yes post cards too. The styles in the gift shop did not draw me in. No Aloha shirts available. I also would suggest real Hawaiian music in 140. The music at night was terrible. Hawaiian music is so beautiful and peaceful. It goes with the setting. Tom, the manager of the hotel came up to us and made sure everything was to our satisfaction.

353455564,50,Best Hotel in Hawaii,"We have stayed in the best hotels in Hawaii (Four Seasons Hualalai on the Big Island, Four Seasons Maui, and the St. Regis Princeville Resort in Kauai) and the Four Seasons Resort Lanai is by far the best one. This resort belongs in the 5 star Forbes and 5 Diamond AAA category. The resort recently completed a renovation in February 2016. When we arrived at the hotel, we were greeted by a hotel ambassador. The ambassador escorted us to our room. Each hotel guest is given a waterproof wrist band which allows you access to your room. Everything in the room is controlled by a touch pad (lights, shades, etc...). Even the toilet has a motion detector, so when you enter the bathroom the toilet seat cover raises automatically. The toilet has the Washlet technology which is also controlled by a touch pad. There are many activities that we enjoyed. Our 1st full day in Lanai, we did the Polaris UTV tour. Request for the local tour guides, Alan and Renan. They are very knowledgeable and professional. Our 3rd full day, we went to the Spa and had the Lani Lomi massage. I highly recommend it since the massage techniques are uniquely Hawaiian. Finally, we ended our last full day, doing the Snorkel Sail with Trilogy Excursion. I also strongly recommend this since the catamaran is exclusively for the Four Seasons Lanai Resort guests. It truly felt like a private sail since there were only 3 couples (including us). Please note that the sails are only on Thursdays and Mondays. Tried eating at most of the restaurants (Nobu, One Forty, Kailani, and the Sports Bar). The food and drinks are expensive, but the quality of the food is outstanding. I would like to give special thanks to Oscar (the bellman) and Yushan Chen (the restaurant manager at One Forty) for their exemplary service. We can't wait until our next visit.

You can snorkel and take a hike on a couple of trails nearby. Golf is down the road. Be ready to pay for being on a remote island. The food and beverage pricing is high, but goes with the rates paid for the rooms. One comment I would make is with the price paid for the Four Seasons experience, would have been nice to have complimentary airport shuttle.
