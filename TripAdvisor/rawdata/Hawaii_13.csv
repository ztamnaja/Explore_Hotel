863890099,50,A very luxury stay for our anniversary!,"Stayed here for our wedding anniversary. Room was ready when we arrived around noon. Received complimentary champagne and lovely greeting card from the staffs.  The room is very spacious, includes kitchen, washing machine and dryer, Japanese style toilet, double bathroom vanity set and large deep bathtub. The balcony is facing the beach, the view is stunning!  There are 2 pools on lobby level. One for family with children, the other is for adults. Family pool has a short slide for children to play. Both pool has great view overlook the street and afar to the beach.",Oct 9,October 2022,Traveled as a couple,,
857201266,50,Good for a family,"After lots of consideration and looking around, I finally settled on the R-C Waikiki Residences for the majority of our stay on Oahu. We had a two bedroom suite for our family of four (3 adults and a teen). The size was perfect and probably the favorite spot was the balcony overlooking the park and ocean on one side and the city on the other. Would have preferred one chaise lounge than a chair and footstool, but that is minor. In advance I had asked that the bedding for the sofa be put out (but not made up) and it was there as asked.    A couple of minor issues with the room. We noticed that on many of the seams of the wallpaper needed some TLC and some re-glueing. Also not one drawer in the unit to put your clothes in either room. Rather, we had to unpack and place our clothing on the shelves. This is when my packing cubes were handly. The ironing board did not fit in the shelf area and had to be set at an angle, which made it not possible to fit two suitcases in that shelving area. We got the impression that our unit might not have been used for guests until more recently. Finally, not sure if this is true with all similar suites, but for our suite there was no door on our bathroom and a window (with blinds) from the bedroom overlooking the entire bathroom. Not a big deal for us - but this could be for others.    All of the staff through out our stay was super friendly and helpful.    For us, it was a perfect location and certainly within walking distance to any of the beaches. At first I was nervous about not being beachside, but in the end I think that was the wiser decision as we were not in the hub of activity and noise...but it was only a few blocks away. So don't let that stop you.",Aug 2022,August 2022,,,"Acton, Massachusetts"
863360507,40,"Surprised about the cost vs. what you get - was nice, not ""amazing"" though","Lovely room & facilities, though it would want to be for the price. I have to admit for a ""Ritz"" there didn't seem to be much ritz...the pool was lovely, but again a bit small. I was there in early September, so the pool was a bit chilly perfect for switching between the hot tub / spa. If you do spend any time at the pool - sunscreen. I got burned bright red in like 20 mins!    If you're wanting to splurge I would almost recommend doing it on one of the other Islands - you can fly between them very easily & cheaply. Personally, the aesthetics of architecture in Waikiki / Honolulu were my least favorite",Oct 5,September 2022,,,"Brisbane, Australia"
861941840,50,"Amazing hotel, amazing staff, amazing location!","Wow. This hotel left us speechless! Incredible customer service, extremely clean and the most perfect location. From the time we stepped out of the taxi to check in, we were greeted by the amazing staff here at the Ritz and given detailed instructions on where to go to check in. The reception staff were amazing. Super friendly and informed us of everything we needed to know. The hotel room was more like a condo which blew us away. Super spacious, extremely clean, housekeeping replenished everything daily and the view was incredible! There was a washer and dryer in the unit which was so convenient for us. We tried La Vie restaurant for breakfast (Summer was our server and she was amazing) and the food was delicious. We went to Quiora for dinner twice and the food was amazing! (William the bartender served us and he was awesome). Service was really quick! The pool staff stayed on top of everything, brought towels right away and gave you a menu to order food. They brought cold water for you throughout your stay). The location is a few minutes from Waikiki beach and steps away from luxury row. There are stores a part of the hotel that we went to for water and snacks and coffee. It was super convenient. They have a spa which I would have loved to try out but we ran out of time. ALL staff were so helpful and always had a smile on their face. We loved this hotel so much that it’s going to be hard to settle for anything less anywhere else we travel. You have to book here at the Ritz - I promise you will not be disappointed.",Sep 2022,September 2022,Traveled as a couple,,"Toronto, Canada"
861436622,50,Clean facilities and impeccable service,"Very clean facilities and excellent service. Every single staff member was super courteous and accommodating, from the front desk to the valet to the housekeeping. They paid attention to all the small details and the response time for any request was swift.    They made our check-in experience very delightful with birthday bath bombs, chocolates, and a congratulations sign and note for our parents' retirement. Extra shout-out to Halie for being so friendly and even getting our baby a stuffed Ritz Lion.    This was our first stay at a Ritz Carlton and the experience was so good we are looking forward to staying more at other Ritz's. For the price we felt like it was a great deal too, it was only $600/night but the experience was better than many $1000+/night hotels we've stayed at. They even upgraded our room to the deluxe from the regular ocean view room. Our room had a dishwasher which was super useful for all the baby bottles but our parents' room next door didn't have a dishwasher. All in all, it was a fabulous stay, this will probably be our go-to hotel when visiting oahu.",Sep 2022,September 2022,Traveled with family,,"Union City, California"
861007249,50,Suite life,"This place is clean but kind of a walk to the beach. But it’s conveniently located in Luxury Row, next to Chanel.  Service is great; front desk can be a little snooty, but i don’t deal with them, my husband does. Valet staff are definitely friendly and always helpful, they are the people you deal with on the daily.  Room is spacious depending on the suites. We’ve gotten 2-3 bedrooms. Housekeeping staff is hit & miss. I’ve gotten back to the room & notice they didn’t clean thoroughly like glass table is still dirty or there are still sands or dirty floor. But there are days when it’s pretty clean. My MIL have stayed behind because she wanted to enjoy the hotel & view & have ran into the housekeeping staffs; the one that didn’t do a very good job seemed annoyed at her job, and the other one is very nice & polite & she did a very good job.  I can’t say that I would recommend this place, but if people asked, I’d say it’s nice but have to walk a but to the beach. Shops are walking distance though. The hotel is located before you get into Waikiki traffic.  Too bad, I cannot upload Videos on here.",Sep 2022,January 2022,Traveled with family,$40 valet/parking/night,"Chino, California"
859825001,50,As good as it gets!,"We returned to Hawaii to celebrate our 5th anniversary, splitting our time between Waikiki and Maui. Despite our Maui stay being twice the cost, the Ritz was by far the superior hotel. The customer service is second to none and everyone we encountered was exceptional (valet, front desk, restaurant, EVERYONE). We travel quite a bit and this was by far our best experience...ever!    The rooms were comfortable and in line with what we viewed online. The restaurants provided great food and service. The adult pool was 24/7. Christopher was very helpful in particular, as we decided to extend our stay by a night and he was able to secure our room for one more day, which allowed us to avoid a move.    How great was the stay you ask? So great that we've already booked another anniversary trip next year!",Sep 2022,August 2022,,,"Atlanta, Georgia"
858396830,50,"Beautiful apartment, stellar hospitality","Wonderful condo apartment with gorgeous amenities and great location right in Waikiki. Our 1-bedroom was beautifully appointed with ocean-view balcony, 2 TV's., washer/dryer, soaking tub, glass shower (excellent water pressure), dual bathroom sinks, stove and dishwasher. Sliding panel door separated the bedroom from the living room but we preferred it open because of the amazing view. But the most impressive part of our stay was the amazing hospitality. From the moment we stepped near the valet, you could feel the warmth from the staff. Everyone we encountered was engaging and kind. Special thanks to Sumin Lee for the incredible thoughtfulness. She exemplifies the meaning of hospitality and guest relations. Will definitely stay here again the next time we're in Waikiki and they certainly elevated our impression of Ritz Carlton going forward.",Sep 2022,August 2022,,Ocean View,"New York, NY"
857710019,30,A place feels like home but workers miss the attentiveness,"1. Room is clean and spacious  2. there are laundry and dryer machine inside the suite room  3. The view looking from our room is nice  4. We were welcome when we arrive  5. It does feels like home because there’s kitchen sinks, stoves, utensils, plates, etc  6. Very safe and secured  7. Try their sushi sho, chefs are from Japan and they know what they are doing.    I was looking forward on Ritz Carlton Waikiki on my birthday week since I stayed at other locations such as Hong Kong and California. Their service of those locations were excellent. But for this location, the workers were not attentive like, it was my wife who constantly remind the front desk that it’s my birthday when I check in, even she notifies the reservation ahead of time during the booking. Yet, there was nothing going on when we check in. After my wife reminded the front desk again, We came back from dinner and I only got “four hawaiian beers and a bag of chip.” Come on Ritz Carlton… you guys can do better than that…    I give the hotel 3 stars because the service was unacceptable.",Aug 2022,March 2022,Traveled with family,,"Millbrae, California"

Lovely young lady at reception, so nice and friendly. Bellman we’re great. Room is large and beautiful. We went to the lobby restaurant for drinks prior to dinner. Ru was the bartender, she is very good and has a great sense of humor. I really like to engage with people, and she was spot on. We’re back tonight for drinks and dinner.

852758697,50,Simply wonderful - Deluxe Ocean View Rooms,"Honestly - one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in. Staff and service was top notch from everyone we came across. Room was lovely, with a small kitchen area with fridge, dishwasher, washer/drier, living room and good size balcony. Bathroom had separate shower cubicle, 2 sinks and room to boot.  Only grumble would be that the beds are only double beds size, would have been cherry on top if they had been larger, but this is minor grumble.  Location wise is good, it's peaceful, but not out of it.  We only ate in the Italian restaurant on site as we have young children and this one more catered to them, it was nice food, but we preferred getting out and trying other places.  All in all would not hesitate to recommend.  side note - Tommy Bahamas across the road is wonderful place for dinner or drinks.",Aug 2022,July 2022,,,"Kent, United Kingdom"
848993522,50,June 2022 Trip to Honolulu,"My husband and I were in town for a wedding. We have previously stayed at the Ritz Carlton and other hotels on Oahu and keep finding ourselves returning to this property more and more as of late. From the valet, to the front desk to the housekeeping, to making our room reservation (thank you Regan!!) everyone was very welcoming. This location specifically finds the perfect balance of making you feel at home and welcome (spirit of Aloha!) but still the privacy and elegance of making you feel like you’re on vacation at the Ritz.    When we arrived we had a delicious amenity item (cheese and wine!) that was a perfect tone to start to our vacation. The property as a whole and our rooms were well kept and beautiful just as they were in our previous stays.    Looking forward to our next stay!",Jul 2022,June 2022,,,
847272023,20,probably will not go back again,"We chose Ritz because they had in-suite laundry. We stayed in 1 br suite. After unpacking everything and put our baby to sleep at night, I tried to close the door between the bedroom and livingroom, and made a really loud squeeze sound and door didnt even close properly. The sound was very loud and baby woke up, so we could not use the door at all throughout the stay. Floor was bid dusty when we checked in, and lots of stain on carpets, and couch was also dirty. Overall, the room quality did not meet the Ritz's quality. Location is convenient for shopping, but bit far from the beach.",Jul 2022,June 2022,,,"New York City, New York"

It’s a beautiful hotel very close to the beach and many shops and restaurants. Staff greeted us when we arrived with leis and were so friendly. Our room was perfect and we had complimentary upgrades each time. Room had a kitchen, washer and dryer. Staff arranged for a rental car which was a quick walk from hotel. They also arranged a cab to the airport as we were leaving very early in the morning. Cab was about half of what an Uber would have cost.

The hotel itself is awesome but the staff take it to a whole new level and if I was managing this hotel I would be absolutely wrapped with all of the staff and the work they do!!! 👍    This hotel is not on the beach but it’s only a very short walk to the beach and it makes up for that minor item in so many other ways!

840893980,50,Great service & team at the Ritz,"Wonderful visit. Clean, sanitized site. We went as a couple and felt there were good separated areas for adults and families to enjoy their unique experiences. The Residences are ideal for quieter stays, it’s further from the more crowded areas of Waikiki but all walking distance.    Keep in mind this is not a resort so you can’t expect food around the clock, and casual dining. Most dining is higher end but good if you want to be low key and still have an experience. There’s a market and coffee shop downstairs for snacks and convenience items.    We were lucky to meet Kea who checked us in and provided us a personal list of his recommendations during our stay. We also had a wonderful experience with David, an engineer who had to visit us 3(!) times to help us with a basic repair and had it fixed for us in no time. It’s an investment stay but well worth it for the service you will receive.",May 2022,June 2022,Traveled as a couple,"Valet parking only.

840727541,50,Fabulous hotel! Service was stellar!,"We loved our stay here! The room was terrific! It was quite large with a nice roomy balcony. Nice amenities too! We had a nice size frig with freezer plus a wine cooler. Also had a stovetop and microwave plus a small washer and dryer. We had an upgraded room so not all would necessarily have these but I suspect many do. Pool area was excellent! One thing is you want to be on as high a floor as possible for ocean views. We were on the 29th floor which was great. The public areas are rather limited such as the lobby and such. It’s a couple of blocks to the beach but otherwise in a great location. Really nice restaurants on site. Service was an A+, really outstanding in every way. Highly recommend and will definitely stay at the Ritz again! We loved it!",May 2022,May 2022,,"High floor, at least 25 or higher","Palm Desert, California"
835913752,40,Concierge RED ALERT!,"Overall, very good. The service at the restaurants, the housekeeping and the valet were excellent. The concierge is broken, terribly terribly broken and enough to have us question whether we would return. All staff are polite and well intended. The concierge is not staffed according to needs however nor well managed. They are positioned in a terrible location. They were NEVER available when calling. They always had to return a call. There are only 2 people on for an entire hotel at full capacity and they manage the phones at the same time. If on the phone, they completely ignore guests standing at the desk who can wait 15 minutes or more to get attention. HELLO? This is the Ritz Carlton...at least I thought. There were no communications of confirmations of reservations made. There were no directions or address info provided for reservations made. We spent additional $ on excursions and every single thing required a connect with concierge who was NEVER AVAILABLE. I believe they mean well but this was absolute failure and unacceptable.",Apr 2022,April 2022,,,
834329531,40,Excellent Hotel and Staff but Limited Amenities,"Just returned from a 6 day/5 night stay and just about everything was great. Staff was friendly and helpful. The resort was immaculate and the views were incredible.    We were upgraded to a ocean/city corner suite and both the room and the views were incredible. Housekeeping did a great job and having a washer/dryer in unit was incredible.    The property is a small distance from Waikiki Beach and thus you do not get that ""beachfront property"" feel, for better or worse. It is also in the outer areas of the resort zone, which was great for us both as to the noise and accessibility (i.e. no crowds or traffic).    The only issue was that the property was relatively limited as far as amenities especially for a family. The family pools were relatively small and there were no real activities for the kids outside of the pool.    There were two restaurants on site, both of which were fairly expensive ($20 to $40 per entree) and limited in their offerings. The Dean and Deluca and the Island Market were fantastic. The Market is open to 11 p.m., which is fantastic considering everything else seems to close at 9 p.m.    Overall, the stay was incredible and enjoyable. 4.5 out 5 stars.",Apr 2022,April 2022,,,"Orange County, CA"
833310572,50,Everything Done Right,We had a junior suite with a balcony overlooking the park and Waikiki Beach. The hotel's location is ideal. Just off the Waikiki strip but easy walking distance to everything.    The room was great and the staff very accommodating. It is NOT inexpensive but well worth the cost. The rooms are each individually owned (like condos) but managed and serviced by Ritz Carlton as a hotel.    Everything is clean and in good condition. The room was serviced daily. The adult pool area was a bit small compared to the family pool area but adequate.

From the emails asking about us and our needs that arrived in my inbox several weeks prior to the vacation, to the honestly perfect customer service - from housekeeping to concierge to valet to pool attendants - this hotel was a vacation unto itself.

While not on the beach, it's only a 5 minute easy walk. Our suite was on the 19th floor with a perfect view of the ocean. The kitchen was great to store food and drinks in the refrigerator as well as being able to warm up food and take-out. The hotel is immaculately kept, the pool is beautiful and the poolside service is amazing.

826380474,40,"The Best Hotel in Waikiki, But It Still Misses The Mark","I am a Marriott Bonvoy Titanium and choosing a Marriott property in Honolulu was no easy task. Each one had its pros and cons, and since this was a special stay for my birthday, I decided to choose the most luxe hotel.    Arriving at the Ritz was easy and breezy, with a friendly valet and very kind agent at reception. From the moment we were given our lei until we got up to our room, everything went smoothly. They were kind enough to upgrade us to a grand ocean view room. The views were great! Unfortunately, the hotel isn't that close to the water, so it's also a lot of rooftop views, but we really appreciated the larger room and balcony space. The room was very luxe, with comfortable linens, Asprey toiletries, a huge shower and we had wonderful housekeeping staff. I was very surprised to see that the area rug in the living room was immensely stained. It was also frustrating not to have enough outlets by the bed. We had to unplug the lamps to charge our devices.    This hotel is great, but incredibly overpriced. For the two of us, breakfast each day came to over $100. I know this is the Ritz, and I know Hawaii is expensive, but the pricing made no sense; especially because the food wasn't anything better than any other property. The restaurant and pool staff were wonderful - I was really impressed when the pool attendants remembered my name. There are two pools at this hotel - an adult's pool and a children's pool. Neither was crowded. We never had trouble getting loungers for two. A quiet pool area was one of the main reasons I chose this hotel. There is also a spa, which we tried to use but it was completely booked, and a decent fitness center.    The location of this hotel perfectly fit our needs. It is literally on the main strip of Waikiki, which is what we wanted. Dinners and shopping were a 5 minute walk. This hotel is probably not for those who want easy beach access, however.    Would I stay at this Ritz again? Maybe. But I am more intrigued to try the other Marriott properties in the area first.",Jan 2022,January 2022,,,"Seattle, Washington"
826220081,50,Family of 3 winter vacation,"Amazing; from check-in to the room, house keeping, the teams that manage the pools and restaurants to check-out. We all thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. The location is great as it as the start of the shopping strip so it is less busy than the core (keep in mind this is still a major city so there sill be noise all throughout the day). We had breakfast in our room every morning using the in-suite kitchen. This allowed us to start the day off with a meal on our balcony while we discussed the events for the rest of the day. The fridge in our deluxe ocean view room was larger than expected so we made a few trips to food land to pick up some essentials (eggs, milk, water, OJ, cold cuts, fruit etc) and we had lots of room to keep them fresh. My 12 year old also appreciated the fact that there was a large open grassy park nearby where we could go each day and bump around the volleyball without any concerns of people or car traffic. Just beyond the park is a small strip of beach that was a great alternative to the busier/farther Waikiki beach. We spent most of our time staying close to hotel but when we did venture off in our rental car (North Short, Diamond Head and Pearly Harbour), everything was easy to navigate to from the hotel. We appreciate the courtesy and level of service from everyone from the Ritz Carlton Residence.

Location, location, location. First time staying at this property (have stayed at multiple locations on Kalakaua Ave) this property is awesome for two reasons (1) it is located right near the start of Kalakaua avenue so you are within walking distance to all the hustle-bustle. (2) because it is at the beginning you are not constantly in the hoards of people walking up and down (i.e. the pain of driving in and out of the moana surfrider valet). Service - 5 starts all around. The valet, check-in, spa, all greeted me happy birthday (a small detail, but really makes you feel special!).

822695877,50,A wonderful Grand Suite stay with truly impressive service and Ambassador recognition,"Our 6 night stay at the Ritz-Carlton Residences Waikiki Beach this last week was very comfortable and with a very impressive level of luxury service and elite recognition. Barring our first suite’s air conditioning issues that were very quickly and adeptly handled, plus a few minor maintenance issues, we really had a great stay.  #ritzcarltonresidences #ritzcarlton #waikiki #honolulu #oahu #hawaii    We’d booked (in June) the highest category one bedroom Grand Suite so we wouldn’t have to worry about upgrades so close to the Christmas holiday. We thought the RC was a steal compared with the much higher rates at the other 5 star luxury options (the Halekulani and Kahala, at both of which we’d stayed many times previously). This was our first stay in Honolulu in about 12 years, though.    The Ritz-Carlton Residences are comprised of two large towers located a few blocks off the Waikiki Beach, just about a 10 min walk to the nearby oceanfront Halekulani hotel. We weren’t at all concerned about being a few blocks from the beach, and that fact didn’t change my impression even after the stay.    The Ritz-Carlton Residences certainly feel more like a hotel than a resort, however, due to their lack of any green space and the minimal open space areas. The small adult and family pool decks, where the hotel’s Quiora, La Vie, and Sushi Sho restaurants also are located, were just about the only “open spaces” in the entire hotel facility. The spa is also located on that same level.    Our request for 1 pm early check in was approved and I received the app notification that our suite was ready when we landed around 12 pm. By 1 pm, we were in our Grand Suite.    Our originally assigned 26th floor Grand Suite (room 2609) was spacious and had great views, but its layout wasn’t great for us. The bathroom was situated adjacent to the bedroom with shutters that allowed the bathtub and bathroom to enjoy the views shared with the bedroom. It had a full kitchen with center island, too. But the air con was the real issue, since the suite bedroom never cooled below 69-70 F despite my normal written guarantees for 65-67 F on booking and again well before our arrival. That problem inevitably forced us to move to a different Grand Suite by 10 pm on our first evening. Despite the letdown, the hotel team handled the letdown with a great deal of grace. Sorry, but I never managed to get any photos or video of the original suite.    We also had an amazing tray from Dean & Deluca as our welcome amenity. That was really quite impressive.    The new 24th floor Grand Suite (room 2405) air con was vastly better, not being located as close to the warmer side of the building. It also had better ocean views, surprisingly, looking more directly across the open park area below onto the ocean. It also had a much better layout for us — with a long hallway separating the interior bathroom and the ocean view bedroom. The air con in the bedroom was always 65-67 F as guaranteed. The kitchen was more of a kitchenette area with dining room table which also worked better for us.    WiFi was an impressive 125 Mbps download, 140 Mbps upload. Those are the kinds of speeds a luxury hotel should offer.    We found the suite to be incredibly comfortable, if not exuding any Hawaiian sense of place as I’d normally prefer. If you prefer modern, this property will do it for you. It almost could have been a Park Hyatt with its more modern but mundane sensibilities.    Service was excellent. Maybe some of the best we’ve ever enjoyed in Honolu, right up there with the Halekulani and Kahala.    Pre-arrival, the front office director, Mary Jane, took care of all my needs after a bit of an issue with their concierge team not being as responsive as I’d expect. She and the concierge team helped book all of our many lunches and dinners — including the original Roy’s Kai, Merrimans, Sushi Sho, Orchids, MW, Quiora, etc, as well as a special private dining room dinner at Senia.    The hotel valets were wonderful. Valet parking was $40, and their team were always on it. Housekeeping was always great — you could call and schedule ahead of time or just call and ask for service. They always came when we asked. They even did a few nights of turndown service for us on request, even as that isn’t normally provided now. The phones were always answered whenever we called for anything.    Our suite rate included breakfast — something not normally included for elite members, of course. The hotel applies a $60 credit toward breakfast at the Quiora restaurant or via in-room dining. But because of my Ambassador status, the hotel waived all breakfast charges for us — as they always went above $60. We had breakfast at Quiora for our first 3 mornings and then had in room dining for breakfast for our last 3 mornings — all completely free of charge. They also comp’d our arrival lunch for us — a super sweet and unexpected gesture, indeed. #AmbassadorStatusMatters    Food and beverage were great. We enjoyed all of our Quiora breakfasts and the Quiora lunch. One of our in-room breakfasts wasn’t correctly cooked to order, and they brought the correct order very quickly. Dinner at Sushi Sho was amazing — worthy of 2 Michelin stars IMO.    We also enjoyed excellent pre-dinner cocktails at the La Vie bar with another fellow Ambassador and his wife. The hotel team went out of their way to reserve seats for us at the bar even as they don’t normally allow that.    While we didn’t love being back in Honolulu or Waikiki, we really enjoyed our stay. It was definitely 5* even if it’s not a proper resort. If ever we had to be back in Honolulu, we gladly would consider returning to the RC Residences — though our next stay more likely would be back to the much more Hawaiian feeling and recently renovated (but more expensive) Halekulani.",Dec 2021,December 2021,,,"Newport Beach, California"

(Having a washer and dryer in room is a feature that makes things so easy when packing up). The desk staff, the pool staff, the waitstaff at the restaurant, all just crushed it at each opportunity. Thoughtful touches everywhere, like the treats and gifts in the room, the surprise snack at the pool, the daily ice cream sampling.

To echo other reviewers, the location can't be beat if you want to be near downtown and all the action. The hotel is in perfect walking distance to Waikiki beach, the Royal Hawaiin Shopping Center, restaurants and bars, luxury shopping, etc.    The initial selling point for me was how well appointed the rooms are. The kitchen has decent sized appliances and the washer and dryer are a God-send, especially when you're on a long trip that requires a lot of pool and beach time.    But I want to talk about the service which was hands down a 15/10. The staff was super attentive, to the time we pulled up, and to the time in between and when we left. Everyone was super polite and friendly which honestly just made our trip better. I couldn't figure out how to work the washer/dryer at first and when the front desk sent someone up, he took the time to go over how to work any and all appliances in the unit. It sounds like a small thing, but the attendant was so nice and patient.",Dec 2021,December 2021,,,"Washington DC, District of Columbia"

And bonus - a Dean and Deluca is on the ground level - I was so excited to see the return of this premium coffee and pastry shop. I hope more are coming back to US! I stayed on the 16th floor of the Diamond tower and the views were breathtaking. I was traveling alone so I enjoyed the adult pool option for relaxing. Do note that the sunsets are beautiful from the adult pool, but there is a resident who takes up swimming laps the ENTIRE sunset each night and splashes anyone in the hot tubs on each end when he flips. So not so relaxing to watch sunsets there. I was thrilled at the option for late check-out as I had a red-eye out that evening - so thanks to the staff for accommodating this for me.

818755948,50,Beautiful Ritz Carlton Residences,"This was our first time staying at a RC Residences location and we were very happy. They did acknowledge my Marriott Titanium status at check-in. However, due to that fact that it was not a regular hotel they do not offer any kind of upgrade, which was fine. Rooms were beautiful with plenty of space. Nice kitchenette area with a good size refrigerator. Stacking washer/dryer in the room was convenient if you are staying over a week and need to do laundry. Nice exercise facility, great location and amenities. The beach was within walking distance and always able to find chairs in a good spot. The hotel provides towels to take to the beach and you just pay for the lounge chairs/umbrella separately since it is a public beach area and not part of the hotel. The location of the hotel was great close to many high end retail stores. Food at the restaurant was very good, but needed a reservation even for breakfast due to limited capacity because of COVID. I would not hesitate to come back and stay here again.",Nov 2021,September 2021,,,"Saint Louis, Missouri"
818576761,50,Great hotel,"flew into Oahu about 3pm. No problems. Rented jeep, no prob or lines. checked in, everyone great at Ritz. Got 2 rooms but on different floors. Learned my lesson DO not book with a 3rd party for here. 3rd party service was terrible. BUT RITZ Service is great. They give you water and beach towels every time you pick up your car for valet. Rooms are spacious with large balcony, comfortable beds and sheets. Its a very large room with W/D and small kitchenette. The door of the bedroom closes so there is more privacy if you have small kids with you. We opted for another room but this room was large enough if you wanted to swing it with your 2 small kids. Toilet was a Bidet which is nice. Food choices at Ritz were limited. Ate for B at Quiora (just ok). Dinner at Lavie : wagyu steak was excellent but everything else just ok. Nothing to rave about, we actually only ate at both of those places once. Too many other better choices around.    Homeless people: I read alot of reviews on this and to be honest I did not see one homeless person around during the day or night. HOWEVER my husband got up early at 5:30-630 to get coffee at starbucks and outside he saw plenty every night. He said it was real bad there. He is 6'4 and big so he was not scared at all but worth noting its true what other reviewers are saying. He keep us entertained with stories daily : how one was arguing with a recycle bin and how one had his pants down sleeping with poop on the sidewalk. It goes on and on. It would not deter me from staying here though, it was a really nice room , big and having a w/d and bidet IS THE BEST. Even though its a 10 min walk to the beach its worth the extra hassle. We only went to the beach once so it didn't matter. IF you think you will really do to the W beach more than stay closer. To us we were on the move and it didn't matter. We didn't even try the pool there but it looked empty and nice. 2 pools one adult and one for the kids. There is a ABC like store that is right next door to the hotel which has things like groceries and snorkel gear which is nice. Dean and deluca has shorter hours but I got some coffee there once. All in all it was a terrific stay for the rooms. I would hope the hotel gets some more food options like a smoothie or coffee bar that would be nice. They do have sushi place but only sits 10 so we didn't even try it. So for food options they are a 1 but for rooms a 5 plus. Service 5 +. I hope to be back.

813334561,40,Nice Waikiki Hotel,"It's a really nice hotel but I just wasn't wowed?  Great greeting with a lei and welcome gift in the room. They were VERY gracious in offering me a late checkout since I had a late flight (that was definitely a huge plus which I appreciated a lot).  I was upgraded to a Grand Ocean View room, their largest non-suite, more or less a studio residence. That was the main benefit I see here; it was nice to have a kitchenette and washer/dryer in the room, and I don't think you could find that at another hotel in the area at this price point. The balcony/view was also amazing!  However, I found the bathroom layout to be a little weird (see picture), with the shower and tub not separated, and no door. If you needed to get any work done (why are you doing work in Waikiki!! but still), the desk/chair in the room were not very comfortable. There wasn't a great/comfortable option for eating in the room, there's a coffee table in the living area, but otherwise nothing but the desk.  Room service was good but not exceptional.  For being a relatively new hotel, it seemed like some of the furnishings etc were a little more worn than I'd expect. It wasn't bad, but I did actually look it up to see if it'd been converted rather than a brand new building.  I went to the adult infinity pool a few times and that was really nice; good service and food/drinks, too.  I left a note for housekeeping asking for extra towels and they did not leave any.  La Vie.. two parts here. 1) One of the best tasting meals I've ever had. I was able to ask for more, but the wine servings were very small; I thought he was just offering a taste of the first one (of 3 pairings) to confirm that's what I'd want, but that was the actual serving.. 2) For being so great.. about 4 hours later, in the middle of the night, I found myself rather unwell.. and remained so until mid-morning. Concierge/room service are not 24/7 so I had to wait a bit to get something to settle my stomach. So, once they were in, I called down to the concierge and asked for a few specific things: Coca-Cola, ginger tea, and Pepto Bismol. They worked it into what was available via room service, substituting ginger ale and Pepsi.. My understanding is that concierges should basically be able to move heaven and earth, so it seemed weird to me that calling down and saying ""I think your restaurant got me sick, can you procure a few things for me"" didn't get me those exact (reasonable?) items. Overall this just resulted in a not-great last day in Hawaii. I would also definitely say this wasn't worth $300+ for dinner (probably the most I've ever spent on a meal for just me).  Other than the negative La Vie experience, everything was fine and the above are just notes, but I would really only return if I needed the residence-like amenities in the room.",Oct 2021,September 2021,,Stunning views from Grand Ocean View room,"Seattle, Washington"

Everything about the hotel and our room were absolutely perfect! The views, the location, and the amenities were all that we hoped for. What really made the trip was the staff and the spectacular service. Prior to our arrival, David Nakamura, Concierge, helped me book flowers for my wife's birthday and helped us book a golf outing.

807975488,20,WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!,"It truly is incredible how poor customer service can completely ruin a visit at a beautiful hotel, and force you to vow to never return. First off, I am not a princess and do not expect staff to be falling all over me. The fact the staff is trying so hard to fall over you with their over the top FAKE customer service that ends up just annoying you. When you do ask for common sense customer service they fail to preform. Check in was RIDICULOUS. The over the top PRETENTIOUS customer service is slow and the line ups to check in are terrible. Our visit was with 2 couples, 2 rooms checking in. We had been in Hawaii for 7 days (previously in Kauai). The Hawaiian border at Honolulu airport did not process my co-vid information properly, as if I had not cleared on the app. The Grand Hyatt in Kauai had the same ""problem"" with me, using common sense that I had my Co-vid vaccine card and since it is IMPOSSIBLE to enter without going through the inspection allowed me to stay. The Ritz, was saying I needed to go BACK to the airport to get the clearing on the government app. HUH?? How was I supposed to get back through security, over a week after I landed for them to update my info? We waited for over an hour until it was decided that if I showed my card it would be ok. No apology, no please go have lunch or a drink in the bar while we figure out this out. Neither party was allowed to go to their room till it was sorted out. And then when we got our keys the bowing and 2 hand presentation, which you literally wanted to snatch the keys out of their hands and stomp off to your room (I resisted). Both pool areas are small and were packed with people so we couldn't use them. Avoid ordering room service - highly over priced, takes way too long and the order was incorrect. Go down to the ABC store located outside the property and get yourself takeout food (which was excellent) and at a great price. Avoid asking for an scale - it will take an hour. Avoid asking for luggage service - it will take an hour.

It started a little rough, as we had traveled all day with a 22 month old toddler who was fussy from being tired and it took some time to get a pack and play which we had requested a few weeks prior to arrival and again at check in. For some reason it wasn't in the room and took over an hour to bring up to the room. This was somewhat hectic with a tired toddler, but once this was all taken care of, everything from that moment on, was phenomenal. Way above our expectations. The property is beautiful with awesome amenities. We stayed in a corner ocean view suite - beautiful. The staff at the front desk and the pool area were so attentive. Our daughter loved the pool!  While we initially were somewhat hesitant about the hotel not being on Waikiki beach, it was actually nice that it was a few block away as it was a little calmer and more quiet. The walk to the beach is very short and easy. We walked by some of the other hotels that we thought of booking (e.g. The Westin Moana Surfrider) and decided that we are happy we chose the Ritz and would stay at the Ritz again next time and forego the other properties on the beach.

I was a total mess on the phone and Yokina could not have been kinder, more patient or more understanding. That in itself warrants a loyal customer but today when I came home, I was shocked to see that we received flowers from the Ritz' manager, Sandy with a lovely message. I was truly touched.

The only thing was as we chatted, we informed we were in from a very long flight and he seemed a bit determined to show us around before providing the room card. The room upgrade made up for that misstep. The service was outstanding. A mishap occurred with a short power outage as we returned one evening which resulted in elevators going off line. The staff was very apologetic and waited to assure everyone was up to their rooms safely. Pool cabana reservations were extra but were enjoyable.

Noe and the young ladies at registration were always so helpful.

Casey even went to the trouble to get me a table at Hy' s when I wanted lamb chops the next night but had no reservation. And the food was great there as well!  The new manager at Quiora and her team were very welcoming and a pleasure to meet each day. And the food was amazing there as well!  Robin at the pool was not only very helpful in preparing a spot for me to relax, she was just a joy!  The 2 young ladies at the spa (I only recall Jakoina's name) were so patient and helpful as I made a decision on the items to purchase.

800791191,50,Outstanding service,"Really enjoyed the can-do, friendly service at a recent stay here! Service goes a long way and consistency amongst all the staff goes a long way. I found myself literally saying I haven't had such a uniformly friendly and efficient interaction during a day in ages.    Great job all around from the team.    That said I have to be truthful the pools are absolutely unacceptably awful. They are like 3'3"" which is about 1' shorter than you want a pool to be. They are tiny, missing tiles, with a view of approximately nothing.    A second thing is I didn't see a bar open my entire stay. Just seemed off for a high end property at this price point to not have a staffed bar all day.    So I guess what I'm saying is I really enjoyed my stay and the staff made it great. Skip the pool and find somewhere else to go have fun. I'd return.",Jul 2021,July 2021,,,Puerto Rico
798971156,50,Beautiful Oasis in the middle of Waikiki,"We were here for just one evening, which happened to be my birthday, on our way back to Tennessee after staying the week in Maui. We are Ritz-Carlton brand loyalists, having stayed in many locations, but never a residence-only property like this, so we were unsure of how the service would be.    I was quickly assured when I received a pre-arrival email from Moko Miura, the Guest Relations Agent, who inquired about our stay. After learning that we were celebrating my birthday that evening, dinner was arranged at the Quiora restaurant in the building, with beautiful ocean sunset views.    David Nakamura, the Concierge Supervisor confirmed the details of our stay and dinner the evening before and later coordinated the return of a very important item that my wife had mistakenly left in the room. We were later contacted, by Seth German, Purchasing Coordinator, who made sure that we had the tracking numbers of the FedEx shipment that he had arranged. We were very grateful for their help!    The units themselves were modern and stylish with all of the amenities and appliances of a condominium, with a 17th floor balcony with ocean views of the Waikiki Beach area, away from the hustle and bustle of the city and beaches.

The hotel was modern and well maintained, but most importantly the staff were attentive and helpful. We were able to get a corner suite overlooking the pool. The room was clean and comfortable, we especially enjoyed the nice and comfy king size bed. It had a large bathroom with soaking tub and walk in shower. We especially liked the in-room washer and dryers, they made doing laundry a breeze.

796371042,10,Awful experience at the Honolulu Ritz!!!!!,"Horrible experience. The hotel was overbooked for the amount of services they offered. Elevators confusing, staff at both pools gave misinformation, closed pool service before 5:00 pm. Told us we could go to with bar and get walk up service. Not true. First one said no walk up service and we could not go in; second said bar was overbooked and we had to get on waitlist when clearly they had seats. It was pure discrimination as we were not dressed as elaborately or were as young as the two guys in the bar. I complained to front desk. They sent up two complimentary drinks in plastic cups to our room. And this is the Ritz and I am platinum with Marriott. Outlandish prices for room and food and never got to go to either bar. DO NOT STAY HERE if you are 50+. Very disappointing",Jul 2021,July 2021,Traveled as a couple,,"Houston, Texas"
795887591,30,Not my cup of tea...quite literally.,"I stayed at the Waikiki Ritz (party of 8, 3 rooms) for a week in July 2021 for a family reunion. We were told that we would all be on the same floor, but the check-in staff said this was impossible. They did upgrade us to a nicer room as an apology, but the mistake at the beginning of our stay paved the way for the rest.    The rooms are spacious and comfortable, but lack amenities (perhaps because of COVID). Another complaint was that Housekeeping continuously failed to restock amenities and I had to call concierge three times for new toiletries (each time delivered with an apology, but nothing changed).    Perhaps the most annoying situation of the trip was the pool. Firstly, the pools are thoroughly underwhelming. There are two (an adult and child pool) but they're small and often crowded due to COVID. I understand that pools can only be so big on a tower in a city, but frankly, they were embarrassing. The child pool is filled with screaming four-year-olds, which makes the whole situation awkward for anybody in the ages of 14-17, as they're too old for the tiny waterslide and spitting tots. One such person was my brother, who was interrogated on his age three separate occasions at the adult pool. The first two employees allowed him to stay, as he was quiet and more behaved than the adult guests, but he was kicked out by the third set, told to go play with the four-year-olds. Again, not the mark of a five star. Interestingly, a large woman had her entire nipple out at the edge but she was not told anything. Truly embarrassing on the part of the Ritz, but at that point, we left the pool and didn't come back.    Ultimately, the hotel is okay, and definitely not bad, but I would save your money. It wasn't at all close to the value of the 600+ a night we paid for it. And if you have kids over 12, choose a different spot.",Jul 2021,July 2021,,,"Tustin, California"
795176488,50,I wish all Hotels were like this,"At this price point you expect a certain level of attention. This checks all those boxes, we were escorted to the room, shown how to use the high end oven/microwave and I enjoyed the 'japanese' toilet. Valet service was always fast, housekeeping prompt, and there was always complimentary bottled water available (in the room, or given to you along with beach towels as we headed out). The concierge, David Nakamura deserves special praise for fulfilling our numerous requests. What makes this place more enjoyable is that the staff are friendly, with an uncommon warmth that went beyond 'professional'. We stayed in unit 2803 in the diamond head tower. On the downside, my son complained that the fold out bed wasn't as comfortable as his bed. The doors that separated the bedroom were obscured louvered glass, so while there was visual privacy, there was no acoustic privacy. My son enjoyed Quiora, the outdoor restaurant, particularly the spaghetti. While I enjoyed the mo'betta mojito. Would happily stay here again.",Jul 2021,June 2021,,,"Jersey City, NJ"
794648714,20,Not what I expected from the Ritz,"The Ritz-Carlton is considered a luxury brand, providing the highest level of service, at least this was my perception before staying at this Waikiki property. We were a family of 4 (including 2 adult boy/girl children) that booked a 2-bedroom ocean view suite 9 months in advance, my husband is a Bonvoy gold member, not that this should make a difference in the lack of quality of our stay. The request on the reservation was for 2 beds in the second bedroom. We were traveling with another family of 4, who also booked the exact same room. Upon check-in we were given the keys to the room and told we had a king and a queen bed, which did not meet the reservations request, but I thought we would make it work. When we arrived at the room, never escorted by an employee, and ""yes"", I understand that COVID concerns play a factor, but the employee could take a separate elevator and at least make sure that our room was correct. Once inside our unit, we were greeted with the pungent smell of smoke in the second bathroom, and immediately noticed the twin beds that were in the master. Obviously, neither was acceptable, and being on vacation my husband and I planned on sleeping in the same bed. I called the front desk and spoke to a gentleman I could not catch his name, who advised that the Ritz was currently fully booked and nothing could be done to accommodate the mishap. I then asked to speak to a manager, he told me ""there is not a manager here, and I can do anything a manager could do, and right now there is nothing I can do for you."" Seriously, paying $5500 for 4 nights and there is ""nothing you can do."" Not acceptable, so I immediately went in person to the front desk, spoke with the gentleman on the phone and asked to speak to someone/manager/anyone that had an ability to assist. I spoke to Mary Jane and Angelina who advised that there was nothing that could be done the day we arrived but the following day we would be moved to a 3 bedroom unit that surpassed our initial request. To be clear, I never requested or wanted an upgrade, we simply wanted the room that we had paid for. Our luggage was transferred the following day by noon, and I must say the room was outstanding. But why should someone spend the entire first afternoon of their holiday just to get what they booked? By the way, our friends did not receive the room they request either, but upon check-in they were immediately informed that such was the case. With the hot tub under repair by the adult pool, we were informed by the pool employees and the front desk that to access the pool, we must walk through the restaurant while couples were dressed and trying to enjoy a fine dining experience. We felt uncomfortable and the look on the dinners' faces, let us know that they felt just as awkward. I could go on and on from the valet guys showing up late, to the Quiora refusing to serve us upon our initial arrival even though according to their hours, they should still be open. I also do not understand why with such a lovely property and amazing pool setting that drink service around the pool would stop at 5pm, such a missed opportunity to have a cocktail and enjoy the beautiful Hawaiian sunset. It seemed that there was a repeated response from the Ritz employees of what could not be offered to make our stay the best possible experience.  However there were some real stand out individuals in terms of service, Chelsea by the pool offered exceptional service and even offered restaurant advice. David at the concierge desk managed to book last minute tables for a party of 8, Mary Jane, and Angelina who organized the room change.  Don't get me wrong the Ritz-Carlton is a beautiful well appointed property. However I feel management may want to examine their training and service mentality, and operate as a cohesive unit instead of individual departments founded on what ""we can do"" to make your stay exceptional, instead of what ""we cannot do.""",Jun 2021,June 2021,,"confirm and reconfirm the room you have booked, high up as possible due to street noise","Raleigh, North Carolina"

793078564,20,Great property but lack of customer service,"Stayed here in mid-June for 5 days. Selected a corner-unit deluxe ocean suite to appreciate the sights and scenery. The property is well appointed and conveniently located.    Although the entire property is non-smoking we unfortunately had a neighbor (not sure if they were adjacent or below) that heavy chain smoked on their lanai (balcony). This meant that we had to keep our balcony window closed at all times- no breakfasts on the patio, no watching the sunsets etc. the few times I attempted to sit out there I ended up smelling so bad that I required a shower and change of clothes.    I politely informed a staff member at the front deck, who was incredibly polite but off the mark in their suggested solutions. He indicated that he could “inspect our unit.” The issue wasn’t within our unit- it was that a neighbor was not adhering to the non smoking policy. He then suggested providing some air fresheners for our unit…again, thanks, but I want to open the lanai and sit outside. There wasn’t an issue when everything was closed up. He assured me he would let security know and would follow up with me. I never received any follow up and the behavior continued.    I went down to the lobby again the day before checking out and the lady at the front desk clearly was unaware of the issue. She kept looking at her screen and it was clear that nothing had been noted. I told her not to bother at that point since we were checking out in the morning. To date- no one from the Ritz has reached out to apologize or even acknowledge the experience.    I realize this was a unique issue based on the bad behavior of a guest vs the property itself. But my rating is reflective of a premium property not training their staff adequately on how to deal with a guest issue and how to communicate effectively on a solution. I expect more from the Ritz.",Jun 2021,June 2021,,,

Myself, my husband, and our 4y/o daughter felt very comfortable, safe, and relaxed here! The family pool was where we spent most of our time and it didn't disappoint. The pool deck staff were friendly, attentive, and very responsive. The pool was heated, had a slide, and provided hours of entertainment for our daughter who loves to swim.    The room was very comfortable and was a 1-bdrm suite complete with a kitchenette, ocean view, and washer/dryer which was nice. The Nespresso coffee maker was delightful and we got a lot of good use out of the amenities there. The room service staff, particularly Rocky and Mariela, were outstanding. They left some candy and books for my daughter unexpectedly which made her vacation! It was a really kind gesture and we were appreciative.    The location of this hotel is incredible--lots of great food options within walking distance. It's also across from a beautiful park and just a few minutes walk to the beach. We loved the market that was attached to the hotel--the food was delicious and very affordable.

786121857,30,"Lovely resort, Great staff, but some serious issues which resulted in an injury","I booked our stay via AMEX Platinum and from my recollection, the room pic online had a table with four chairs. However, upon check-in we found out our room did NOT have a table, which was not very convenient when traveling with 4 people (myself, husband and our two kids). The front desk agent named Ward (at check-in) was very kind and promised he would continue to look for an option for us or move room (he did mention the hotel was nearly fully booked), however we never heard back from him and when I checked with the front desk a couple more times, I did feel like I was getting the runaround. However, the room itself was nice and clean, but did lack lighting. With only table/floor lamps it seemed dark in the bedroom area and recessed lighting would have been helpful.    The king bed was a very big issue. The actual mattress was two twin beds pushed together--seemed odd, king mattresses that we have had (even our own bed at home) never were twins pushed together. But the worst was the mattresses did not fit properly on the wooden bed frame/base, which left several inches of space being exposed on all 3 sides that we could see (base, left and right) frame. Basically the two twins were too small for the king bed frame.    On the first or second night, I smacked my shin into the very hardwood bed frame which left a big bruise. And on our 3rd night our son (8) was watching t.v. at the end of the bed, laying across the bed horizontally facing the TV, he slipped and when he fell due to the exposed bed frame, while he fell, his head smacked on the wooden frame vs just sliding down the to floor/carpet. Now, he's 8 yrs old, a strong boy who's 4.5"" tall, he's not a small sized kid and he was crying, which he rarely cries when he gets hurt. We were rushing to dinner reservations for our oldest son's birthday with family so we reported the incident the next morning. Our son did not seem to have a concussion and there was no cut, vomiting or dizziness, but throughout the night he said his head hurt and he had a headache. Now, 4 days later and we are back home, he is still complaining of a sore/tender spot on his head and we plan to call his Doc, if it continues tomorrow. When we reported this incident to the front desk agent Debbie she was very helpful and did report to the manager Mary Jane, who called up to our room, was very thoughtful and sent a claims/security person to take a report.    I would also like to comment on the restaurant situation, the lack of room service was a pain (we fully understand the changes due to covid) but the hotel still has onsite dining and valet (valet being a very a welcome change from our first hotel), so I'm not sure why room service could not be done safely with minimal contact. Also, each morning at breakfast the staff was always super kind. Summer was our server and I forgot the person getting drinks but she was very kind and helpful as well. But the issue is, naturally it gets busy in the morning and the lack of staffing was very evident. In fact we called down one morning to order take out and tried calling 3 times, to no answer. I asked the front desk and they said they have a message left for the restaurant to call us, and I don't think a call was every made. My husband finally just went down to order takeout in person and he noted he had to wait 10 minutes before someone was even at the podium and there were also 2 parties in front of him waiting. When we returned to the hotel 30 mins later after a quick errand, my husband went to the restaurant to collect our order which he still had to wait for. It was a fairly simple order of eggs, chicken sausage, and an english muffin. Hardly something you would think would take nearly 50 minutes to make. My thought is this.....we know Covid has drastically changed everything and in fact this was our first trip in over a year in a half. But why book a hotel that is very busy with what seemed like limited staff? We've stayed at Ritz-Carltons in the past in Asia and the US, and hotels from Hyatt Place (moderately priced) to the Four Seasons and for the service provided at the Ritz, for us, it seemed less than 5 star.      The room was very pretty, well cleaned, a stunning ocean view and a lovely bathroom (but like one review I saw, the shower and glass partition did leave a lot of water on the floor. But the shower pressure for was great. There was a very nice Easter Basket left at our door for our son, which was a nice surprise on Easter morning. The staff was was very kind, and always apologized for any problems, but why should they be apologizing......there should be very minimal if any problems with service at a resort with The Ritz-Carlton name (price). Maybe things were a tad different since this is a Ritz Carlton Residences, or Covid, or maybe a combo of both, but the king bed setup definitely isn't due to Covid and should immediately be addressed.",Apr 2021,April 2021,,Best to call to confirm room setup if concerned and ask about king bed situation.,"Bloomfield Hills, Michigan"
784479257,10,Wow,We are actually still in the hotel. The main reason for posting a review before our stay is not even complete is in the hope that someone in management actually reads the reviews as they do not ever answer the phone. After calling 4 or 5 times unable to get anyone at the front desk we became frustrated and gave up.    Homeless people in the park adjacent to the entrance made coming back from dinner a little scary. Especially with no security and only one employee around intermittently.    I called ahead as it was our anniversary and they were supposed to do something special. NOTHING HAPPENED Needless to say it was very disappointing.    In the morning I went to order room service for my wife and after spending 15 minutes trying to get someone and getting the voicemail for security I finally got someone who said they are not offering it currently.

The staff was outstanding, from the valet to the front desk. The room was a deluxe ocean view with a living room, bedroom, kitchenette and washer/dryer. The security at the hotel is awesome as the elevators all require a room key. Sushi sho (make reservations early) is THE best sushi restaurant in Hawaii. Pricey but totally worth it. Now for the bad, we booked a room with a king sized bed but found out on night one that they took two twins and pushed them together. No matter what we did, the two mattresses wouldn't stay together, creating a gap in the middle. The mattress itself was extremely saggy and would push you towards towards gap in the middle. We choose not to change rooms as we had already unpacked and didn't want to deal with the hassle. The other issue was the Espresso machine. It was free and came with four pods (awesome) but the cups weren't big enough for a single serving.

Got upgraded to a one bedroom corner view as a courtesy despite it being available only for Marriott Bonvoy Titanium and Ambassadors. I also got a free tote and two nut leis waiting in my room when checking in. I also got a free bottle of Sparkling wine to celebrate a birthday.    They clean everything and take COVID protocols very seriously.  - Enough Elevators to socially distance all the time (aka ride alone)  - Hand Sanitizer everywhere (that clearly has enough alcohol content because it smells like tequila).  - All staff wear masks at all times  - Disinfect all high touch points like elevator buttons  - Housekeeping works doubly hard to disinfect your room and surfaces    Pros:    - If you can stay in the new building (which we did), the rooms are larger and more updated. The building itself is very modern in the hallways as well.  - Comes with a dishwasher and in unit washer and dryer (which was tremendously helpful if you went to the beach).  - Housekeeping does an excellent job of cleaning everything (scheduled either 9-12, 12-3, 3-6).  - Two infinity pools (one adult and one family), two hot tubs (adult side)  - They leave umbrellas out for when it rains so you don't walk out unprepared  - Concierge provides beach towels (just ask)  - Electronic Toto Bidet in the bathroom  - They provide you with a ton of water bottles (more if you ask), additional towels or pillows (if needed) etc.    So-so  - Pool staff can be attentive at the right hours, but sometimes can take a while to come back with a drink or water (literally 10+ minutes).  - Bidet automatically triggers/activates it's mist spray on the bowl (even when you aren't using it), which started to become an annoyance in the room  - Laundry machine can be extremely loud when it's being used    Cons  - No room service during COVID-19 (they aren't even allowed to leave food outside your room for you to pick it up)  - No spa service available during COVID-19 (understandable)  - Software on TV/remote for TV is slow and unresponsive making browsing a drag.

781214776,50,Highlife Living in Waikiki,"This is a very interesting hotel with private ownerships. It appears that each unit is individually owned but rented and managed by Ritz Carlton.    I booked a corner room with ocean view. The description is actually quite misleading since this corner unit only has partial ocean view and mostly just city views. It’s not too bad since the size is slightly bigger than comparable ocean view rooms. It has a mini kitchen with a cook top and a microwave/oven combo so we were able to make some simple meals like breakfasts. The biggest draw to us is the fact that the unit has fully functional washer and dryer. With the weather in Oahu having a constant supply of fresh clothes is definitely required and welcomed.    The staff is extremely polite and accommodating. We asked for some cooking oil and they were able to acquire from the restaurant downstairs. The house keeping staff is also incredible. One day they noticed we were low on toothpaste and left a new one for us to use. That was a very heart warming touch!    The location is also very good but it isn’t beach front. We made use of the parking garage just across the street since the hotel does not allow self parking and we did not feel safe with valet when there is a pandemic going on. As a side bonus, the rate for parking in the garage across the street is 24 dollars per day as opposed to 40 from the ritz.    This is a well run place and definitely worth checking out. We will likely be coming back for our future getaways.",Jan 2021,December 2020,Traveled as a couple,,"Bellevue, Washington"
780793819,50,Excellent in-town option,"Stayed here overnighting in Honolulu and way back from Maui. Our family didn't want more beach, so we chose this option. Great pools and easy restaurant options for breakfast/lunch is what we were looking for, and they delivered on that. Service and staff were also excellent - reminded me more of an international property than a domestic property in terms of level of service.    Wasn't as relevant for our stay, but the kitchen-ette setup in the room would be very helpful for families.",Jan 2021,January 2021,,,Dallas TX
778524414,10,Covered in bites!!,We are leaving such a low rating on the hotel as for what happened when we stayed there. We booked a week at the Ritz Carlton residencies Waikiki and were having a great experience until one night we woke up with a ton of bug bites. We noticed previously that we had bites but we thought they might have been due to us going out to the beach. Thursday night we stayed in and Friday morning we woke up covered in bites(will attach photos) our original thought was bed bugs so we went down to the lobby and spoke to the wonderful front desk associate who showed concern and called her front desk manager. The manager came and listened to us and gave us itching cream for the bites and then asked us if we had been out because the bites did not look like bed bug bites. In the mean time they moved our room and we asked if they could wash our clothes. Going back to the room to gather up our clothes we found a bug dead on the bed. We showed the manager and she said they would look deeper into what type of bug it was. It turns out that the bug came from the $155 flower bouquet I ordered to surprise my girlfriend with through the hotel. The bugs had gotten on the bed and bitten us multiple times. This whole ordeal ruined our day and caused us to have terrible bites. The clothes that were washed were not delivered to our new room until 8pm in which we had to miss our dinner reservations. Essentially we lost an entire day of our vacation. I’m leaving such a low review because I ordered these flowers through the hotel and pay a huge up charge for them as well so I assume they should not come infested with bugs. We kept trying to get in touch with the general manager but we just kept hearing that he was in a meeting and the message would be relayed. The average night here is $525 and we paid that to get bitten all over by bugs do to them giving us bad flowers. Truthfully we’re not very happy with how we were treated and were thinking about extending our stay but will for sure be moving to different accommodations. The staff is great but this whole situation ruined our trip and we will not be coming back here. Photos will be attached.,Dec 2020,December 2020,Traveled as a couple,,
778379493,50,Top Notch Staff & Hotel,"Arrived at the ritz during the COVID reopening phase in Nov 2020. Resort & city were pretty empty which I enjoyed. We had a 1 bedroom suite which was well laid out with nice ocean views from the 30th floor. The hotel is a good distance from the beach but you still get an amazing view depending on the room you are in. Only small issues with the room were that the Bedroom bathroom doesn’t come with a door and living room coffee table had stains on it from previous stays. Something I wasn’t expecting but nothing major.    I would like to compliment and highlight the great staff at the Ritz Carlton Honolulu. I visited the property recently to celebrate my partners birthday and was blown away from the service the staff gave me from start to finish. Angelina Yick went above and beyond to help surprise my partner for her birthday. she was in communication with me before my arrival to set up decorations, cake flowers etc for a surprise arrival. She was amazing and i am very thankful for the way she displayed the willingness to raise the bar for customer service. Jason who I believe is a director of the property was outgoing and nice as he helped us upon arrival. Mary Jane who checked us in was amazing and gave us great tips and displayed real passion for the ritz brand. All of the Valet members were 5 Star, upon arriving they all wished my partner Happy birthday and knew our names before even checking in. Ryan in Valet was great and always went above and beyond for me during our interactions. His work ethic and customer service skills are unmatched. The staff is the #1 reason why I will be back to this wonderful property very soon!",Dec 2020,November 2020,Traveled as a couple,,"Las Vegas, Nevada"
777302080,50,First Class Operation,"We arrived on the second day after the RC Waikiki reopened - even greeted by the highly professional and gracious General Manager Doug Chang. It set the tone for the visit. Despite the constraints of COVID-limited operations, the RC Waikiki team did an excellent job - including handling our in-room quarantine status the first two days of travels as we waited 84 hours for our “24 hour” COVID test from CVS(!)    We were initially booked at the Four Seasons Ko Olina, where we had stayed previously (and really enjoyed), but their reopening date was pushed to late November. This was our first time at this RC.    Despite the Waikiki location, this property feels more like a boutique (the low occupancy during our stay also contributed to this). The on-site restaurants are excellent, but hours of operations are spotty during these early days and there is no great place to grab a casual lunch on property. (Tommy Bahama’s across the street is good for lunch.) The ABC Hawaii Country Store on property is a lifeline for snacks and breakfast...w/a surprisingly good red wine selection.)    Our room (Grand Ocean View Suite) was lovely - roomy, elegantly designed in minimalist fashion. Everything worked.    Despite the Spa and Shop closure (again, COVID), the staff grabbed a few items for us.    Things to consider: This is a Waikiki location, so very much the urban Hawaiian experience. If you want to wake up to the sounds of the ocean, this is not the place. Beach is an easy four block walk, not just an elevator ride.    Views to the ocean are unobstructed, but higher floors actually highlight the buildings around the property (including the very convenient - and visible - Post Office). I think the views from lower floors maybe a bit better, but may add to street noise (and there is plenty).    If you are a sun worshiper, the afternoons on your balcony or by the pools are for you - lots and lots of direct sun.    Be aware that during these early days of reopening, much is not open on the Islands; hotels, restaurants and even state parks like Diamond Head and Hanauma Bay are closed. Now is a good time to come if you are a Hawaii regular want to chill and get some some sun before you are snowed out at home. Not the time to come for your first Hawaii experience - you’ll miss too much. While foot traffic along Waikiki’s shopping district was eerily and unsettlingly quiet the first week, it did pick up a bit towards the end of our trip.    Also, know that Hawaii is serious about mask wearing and having an approved COVID test. If you don’t have all your pre-paperwork done properly, including your COVID test, you will not be able to rent a car or even technically leave your room - so plan ahead. Regardless, plan on 60-90 minutes to get out of the airport.    We thank Doug and the team at the RC Waikiki. They did a great job under trying circumstances. Well done. While not our usual Hawaii trip, we are glad we went.",Nov 2020,November 2020,Traveled as a couple,,"Washington DC, District of Columbia"

Patio and view is fantastic. The hotel location is the best ever, you'd have Chanel at the corner:)  The in-hotel dining doesn't have much choices but there are tons of restaurants in Waikiki. The restaurant has nice decor though, i wish they offer afternoon tea choices. The pool is small but good for little kid/babies.

752019999,50,Short but excellent stay,"I stayed here briefly on a stopover before a trip with friends. Everything is mostly to the standard you would expect at a Ritz-Carlton property throughout. The location is not beachfront but still has nice views and is an easy walk to the main roads and luxury shopping. Check in was easy and very friendly concierge. The suites are geared for longer stays with kitchenettes; spacious and bathrooms are large, high tech and functional. Lots of little details at this property elevate it to a higher level, from the hotel whisking you directly to your floor, to the welcome drink and personalized check in service, to the room amenities and little welcome gifts. Not much time to experience the property as a whole but the infinity pool was perfect for an evening swim-my only comment would be there was no attendant on at that point and there was a number of wet towels that had been discarded around the deck. Gym was clean, spacious, and had all the equipment you could need. Would definitely return for a longer stay next time.",Mar 2020,March 2020,,,Canada

750344121,50,World Class Service,"The Ritz Carlton Gold Standards are alive and well at this property. What an amazing experience we had over our brief stay. From the moment we arrived in the wee hours after a long flight delay and without my luggage, Mr. Ho at the front desk made every effort to turnaround the events.    Mr. Ho’s warm welcome followed up by an amazing birthday surprise of a handwritten note (!!) along with some delicious birthday treats was such an unexpected delight. Kudos to him and the entire front desk for realizing the smallest gesture goes a long way when a trip has an auspicious start.    As for the property, it is everything you expect at a Ritz Carlton and more. This property has residences and the space delivers on every point. Beautifully styled accommodation, well-appointed bathrooms, gorgeous kitchen, a bed so comfortable you want to pack it and take it with you, and extra space to make it feel like a home vs a hotel room.    The location is tucked away from the hustle bustle but still right in the middle of all the shopping, dining, etc you expect in Waikiki. Plus, the view from our room did not disappoint.    The infinity pool is a sight – there’s a family pool and an adults only pool to suit whatever works for your stay.    Quiora was the perfect dining option for sunset cocktails and light bites. And, Dean and Deluca is onsite for all your coffee, dessert, grab & go needs. Personally, the in-room nespresso machine is all I need but the D & D brekkie is a nice option.    Kudos to the team at this property, the level of care and attention to detail is everything the Ritz Carlton Gold Standards promise.

748547473,50,The Ritz is Ritzy,"This is a great overall property. The views on the high floors are special. We loved our room which was a two room suite on the 27th floor. The small kitchen area was perfect to be self sufficient when needed. The service was exceptional at times and under whelming at other times. Crystal from the concierge desk was outstanding and made our stay very enjoyable. The breakfast and bar servers were OK not great. Cold espresso served in a cup with lipstick on it, an awkward conversation about including gratuity on over charge was a bit odd. It didnt hit me until later why a hotel like the Ritz would do this. Having traveled to many Asian countries I realized many folks dont tip at all and they probably include the gratuity so that they dont get stiffed. I consider myself a great tipper always a minimum of 20% when I get even good service. I like to tip big early in the stay so that folks remember and the service gts better as the stay moves along. Adding 18% automatically makes for an awkward feeling...do I give them the extra $5 or $7 I normally would or leave it alone?? Will they even remember??? I am not a fan of this approach however I understand it. We would have loved to have been able to eat at Sushisho however we were told there was no chance of getting a table. This is another one of those policies that high end hotels should do a better job managing. If we are dropping $1000 a night on a room the hotel should have some availability at its restaurant for guests staying there and we should not be locked out of any chance for a table during a week long stay. I would definitely stay here again for the view, location and concierge service.

744657663,50,I’d Give 6 *’s If Possible! A MUST STAY,"I just returned home this week from staying at the Ultimate Luxury Establishment The Ritz-Carlton Residencies Honolulu. I’ve never used a “travel company” for packages before because of my misconception of them. I always thought it meant you’re assured to get the most basic of everything. Not so with Costco Travel. I highly recommend them as they made our 23rd Anniversary trip absolutely top notch from flight to car service and hotel. So at check in we’re greeted w/ the most beautiful purple & white Leis along with a refreshing beverage & clothes to wipe with. Time for actual Check In arrived and they already knew that we were on our 23rd Anniversary & graciously upgraded us from a nice corner studio to a full 1 bedroom 2 bathroom Suite w/ full Ocean views. It was beyond any expectation I had. We had Suite 1205 and as you open the door directly to the left is your 1st full bathroom w/ electric toilet, very sweet, and a over sized soaking tub. As you venture down the hall to the left is the full kitchen w/ everything needed plus a washer/dryer combo in the closet. Continue forward into the living room when you’re greeted to the Ocean Viewed wrap around balcony. To the left is the bedroom and 2nd full bathroom w/ double sinks, electric toilet & huge shower. There’s also another exit to the balcony from the bedroom as well. So, yeah, we were quite happy with the room and it’s cleanliness & amenities. As far as the service aspect of the property all I can really say is, BRILLIANT!! You’re made to feel special and welcome, quite like family or good friends. Always treated with kindness and respect. On the 1st day of check in they waited for us to leave the room to set up a deeply appreciated Happy Anniversary card signed by the beautiful staff along w/ a complimentary chilled bottle of wine awaiting our arrival back. There’s absolutely nothing I can fault them on nor complain about. They truly made our special trip exactly just that, extremely special and I’m forever grateful and will definitely be returning again very soon.",Feb 2020,February 2020,Traveled as a couple,,"Las Vegas, Nevada"

The property itself is very nice with the common areas (pools, gym, restaurants, etc) having a cool Hawaiian feel and the rooms are very well appointed and spacious (we had an Ocean View 1 BR suite, for reference).    The staff is what sets this property apart from just about any other resort we have ever visited (including other Ritz properties, Four Seasons, Mandarin Oriental, etc). Every single hotel employee was genuinely warm, friendly, and helpful. Our concierge (Isa) set up excursions and dinners for us for the full ten day stay. The restaurant staff called us by name. The spa had a full birthday gift package for my spouse who was celebrating his birthday during our stay. We casually mentioned a bourbon that is a rare find but can sometimes be found in Hawaii and we came home that evening to a note from our bartender (Ku'ulei) who told us that she had located the bourbon for us at local store.

741558075,50,Wow.. great everything,I have 2 properties that I consider world class in Waikiki and that is the Ritz-Carlton residences and the Trump international. These two hotels are the only true 5-star hotels in terms of room quality service and standards.    The Ritz-Carlton residences is an oddity compared to some Ritz-Carlton hotels as this property is mostly comprised of suites and studio better a hybrid timeshare hotel model.    is part of the Marriott bonvoy program you can find some great reward nights at this property and they also offer pretty generous local discounts to Hawaii residences.    The service and staff is what you would expect at a Ritz-Carlton top notch the hotel definitely caters to a more Asian crowd.    I have stated this property twice and both times the room was of the highest standards if a large well-appointed bathroom comfortable beds and every room has a view.    The own property restaurants are not my favorite there's really nothing wrong with them but they just lack something.  In talking with staff there contracted out and their prices are a bit over the top for the quality of food you receive. They lack any type of local discount which any of their competition in town offer.    If you're looking for a five-star experience the Ritz-Carlton residences is a great option just don't count on the food and beverage options on property to be the best.,Jan 2020,October 2019,Traveled solo,,"Westminster, Maryland"

We typically book a suite and/or 2 rooms now that our son is a teen. We also tend to book premium rooms (oceanfront). On our latest trip, we decided to try the Ritz as booking 2 rooms at the Halekulani would have cost over 2k/night. We were able to book a 2 room apartment at the Ritz for significantly less. We were extremely impressed with the property, the units are fully equipped and very contemporary. I'm still unclear why the pricing was so competitive, my only guess is that the property is not right on the water - however, if you are in one of the higher floors - you have a great (and unobstructed) view of the ocean.

For 180,000 points, I was able to get a beautiful Ocean View room (E2212). When I say 'beautiful', I mean without a doubt GORGEOUS view of Waikiki Beach. My fiancé and I arrived on 01-08-2020. From the beginning, we felt like royalty. The valet and concierge were so perfectly accommodating and friendly. Sky, the young lady who met us curbside, was a delight, welcoming us. She accompanied us from the ground floor to the lobby and brought welcome drinks (delicious - and optionally alcoholic), before passing us off to the reservations manager, Joel. Joel welcomed us and answered any, and all, questions we had. Joel showed us to the elevator and wished us well. He was just as friendly and knowledgeable as Sky! Great check-in experience.    Once we got to our room, E2212 - WOW. Just WOW. The view was incredible, the room was spotless, and the concierge left a special plate of chocolates, as well as a bottle of wine, for my fiancé and I, who happened to be celebrating our recent engagement. There was even a personalized card. Beautiful touch.    Over the next few days, we enjoyed the perfect location of the Ritz Residences, as they are on the corner of 'luxury row', Waikiki's shopping district. The Ritz is in the perfect location, regardless of what you plan to do in Waikiki.    The second night we were there, I attempted to do a load of laundry in anticipation for our departure, but when I woke up in the morning, I realized the dryer had not dried any of the clothes. I contacted the front desk at approximately 7:45am, and they offered to send a maintenance engineer to check out the dryer. Within 2 minutes, there was a knock on my door - the maintenance engineer! Talk about efficiency! He attempted to solve the issue, but after a few minutes, once he realized there was no heat going to the dryer, he offered to send housekeeping to re-wash and dry our laundry for us. After he departed, housekeeping came right to my door, took all my laundry, and told me not to worry. The next morning, upon returning to my room after a trip gone the whole day and night, I discovered all my laundry, on my bed, washed, folded and wrapped in tissue paper with a note from housekeeping. I was so appreciative of the services provided. The housekeeping staff was fantastic.    When we were due to depart, unfortunately the hotel was too booked for a late check-out, so we had to leave the room. (insert sad face), However, the hotel held all our belongings, safely, and we were able to retrieve them without issue, after returning from lunch, to go to the airport.    I could not have asked for a better experience. We intend on returning to Hawaii in October and if we spend any time back on Oahu, we will not go to any other hotel!

738749177,30,Room for improvement,"Stayed in a Grand ocean view 1 bedroom suite for a week 12/27 thru 1/6. While the service with Ritz is always impeccable, the suite itself was somewhat disappointing. Suite 2609 had great views but had some issues (always corrected with prompt maintenance). The sliding door into the master, off its track anytime we used it, rendering unusable until corrected by maintenance. Living room was missing its area rug under the living room grouping, causing the sectional to slide apart anytime you sat on it.  A/c was perfect. Kitchen was adequately stocked for anything you may require. Stackable washer/ dryer also was a nice perk.  Bathroom has no doors so if your staying with another friend (not companion) can be tricky getting ready. Commode has a frosted glass door for some privacy. Plenty of closet space. Efficient elevators.  Room service was good. Typical add-on 20% service fees AND 8.00 room delivery fee.  Sadly our included breakfasts were only available down in the restaurant lobby, some resorts give you a breakfast credit (towards in room dining) that was not available.  The spa services were good, I've had better 90 minute massages. The steam room was under going maintenance improvements, so the only spa amenity I like was not in service.  Valet was also very efficient as we rented a car for our stay. (40.00/ valet fee per day)  There is an adult pool area as well as a separate family pool area. We did not use either but was a nice option.  Housekeeping was very friendly, warm and efficient. Also generous with toiletries, water, daily chocolates etc.  Not really a super pampered/picky 5-star type guest, but when you actually see your bill hovering at the 15K mark your either totally pleased with what was provided and where things were lacking.",Jan 2020,January 2020,Traveled with family,,"Orlando, Florida"

REALLY appreciated that our room was actually a suite with a Laundry room and Kitchen (with our 2.5yr old boy; we have laundry always). Next time would consider a longer stay here than just one day. Downside is that missing is the traditional perks for Platinum Elite status members like us. I'm referring to the 'no free breakfast' offered; no upgraded room offered and no late check out offered but I appreciate that they are very busy as it is Hawaii. The Valet Parking is very professional and convenient, fast but expensive (should be no more than $25). We are thankful to get an early check-in.

736928273,40,"Overall good, but don't expect a Ritz Carlton level service","Overall enjoyed our stay.    Elite recognition: As a Titanium elite, upon request, they did move us to a higher floor room(they initially put put us on the 10th floor with minimal view), but no real other elite member benefit. I would not anticipate on much elite membership recognition if you are planning on staying here. Late check out request was denied with a cold ""no"". It's not a bad property but just have low expectations and you'll be fine.    Pros:  - Being a residence hotel, it does not collect an extra person fee- unlike many other hotels in waikiki  - Room is spacious for a waikiki hotel with a nice balcony  - concierge staff downstairs were eager to help with beach towels/water/directions/recommendations, whatever you may need.  - 2 nice pools, one for family / one for adults. the family pool gets quite crowded in the afternoon.  - I'd recommend hanging out at the pool/jacuzzi in the evening! you can enjoy the live music from the restaurant above.    Good to know:  - It's about 2-3 blocks away(~15min) from the beach. If immediate beach access is what you want, this is not where you want to stay at.    Cons:  - Front desk ALWAYS(morning/afternoon/evening/late night) understaffed and you need to get in line and wait 10-15min if you need them for anything  - service at breakfast restaurant was just not there - aside from somewhat overpriced food(which I expected from a Ritz Carlton), my water stayed empty for a good 20 minutes and nobody came by to fill it. I tried to make some eye contact with my server for a while but gave up after a while. I really don't expect to have to ASK for such things at a Rits Carlton.

736065556,30,"Okay, but ZERO elite recognition.","My husband and I have been here at the Waikiki Ritz for a week...checking out today. The property is new and clean the staff are all what you would expect at a Ritz, very kind and helpful, BUT the policies are lacking! As Bonvoy elite members we spend a significant amount of time in Marriott properties and unfortunately this Ritz has fallen short of our expectations.  We arrived around 11AM and watched dozens of other guests receive access to their rooms, but we were not granted access until 4PM, no early check-in for elite members? We had been on a long flight from Seattle and were hoping to at least freshen up and change clothes, we were pointed to a well-used single bathroom to do so...which was not ideal. We opted for the deluxe ocean view room specifically because it is described to have the “living area separated from bed by privacy wall” this is a completely false description, there is no wall. The TV is also placed in an odd location, only visible from the sofa, not the bed. Another concern, the pools! Not enough chairs for the number of guests that the hotel accommodates. It is nice that they have a family pool and an adult pool. There is also a wait list for chairs at the adult pool, they send a text when the chairs open up. We did this once with no problem. Another time, we received the text, packed up from the noisy family pool, walked over and they had no chairs for us so sent us back to the family pool. We eventually got seats at the adult pool and they offered us each a smoothie for the inconvenience, but again our concerns are not with the staff, but with the process. And, today we have a late afternoon flight and called down to confirm late checkout (which we requested at check in) and were told it was not possible, even as elite members. Very disappointing. There are a lot of Marriott properties here in Waikiki, when we return to the area we will be staying at a different one, one that values both our time and our brand loyalty.",Jan 2020,December 2019,Traveled as a couple,,
735965871,50,Amazing New Resort/ Residence Towers,"We stayed here for one night while visiting Waikiki Beach. We absolutely loved it and wish we could have stayed longer, but we were already booked elsewhere on the island.    This Ritz is only three years old and is comprised of two large towers full of million dollar plus residences. The towers overlook an extremely posh shopping area, and are within walking distance to great stores, world class restaurants, and the beach. Upon dropping your car off with the valet, you then ride some extremely sleek elevators up to the lobby. The lobby has an absolutely amazing view of Waikiki. They greet you with tasty drinks, cool towels and complimentary leis.    We booked a one bedroom suite, and they upgraded us up to a corner suite due to our Marriott status. It is an understatement so say the suite was awesome! Very contemporary with light beige and blue hues, and marble accents in the bathroom and kitchenette. The views of Waikiki are phenomenal. We were on the sixteenth floor and the balcony was very comfortable with two chairs and a table.    Upon entering the suite, there is a brand new washer/dryer to your left (behind a door) and a spacious bathroom to your right. The bathroom has a separate water closet, complete with a Toto smart toilet (my kids got a kick out of the bidet functions and the heated seat). It also has two sinks and a shower and tub. It is, of course, fully furnished with all the necessities (dental kits, lotion, sewing kit, shampoo and conditioner, gel, lotion, nail filer, etc).    Farther into the room is a fully equipped kitchenette, with a sink, Miele oven, Miele fridge and freezer, stovetop, Nespresso machine, and everything you could possibly need in a kitchen (baking utensils, pots and pans, eating utensils, plates, cups, bowls, mugs, etc).    The bedroom itself has a king size bed, a desk, closet with iron and ironing board, and a flat screen television. There is a separate sitting area with a table and four chairs for dining and a pull out sofa. The views were amazing.    There are several bars and restaurants on property. We unfortunately only tried the room service, which was great. There are two pools. An adults only pool and a family pool. Both have great views and are decent size for roof top pools. Very clean! I believe they are the highest rooftop pools in the area. The fitness room (I always need to work out) was well equipped with brand new cardio machines (Precor treadmills, elliptical, steppers and bikes) and hoist stationary weights, free weights, body balls and medicine balls. Again, I loved how clean it was. There was someone changing towels, trash, and cleaning machines off more than once in the hour I was in the gym.

I have 2 million points so you can see I rarely use points and I’m a lifetime titanium. You would think they would have had an experienced person to handle our check in considering I wrote them and explained I’m traveling with my 90 year old parents in a wheel chair and mom with Altzheimers and needed specific accommodations. They said they did not do complementary upgrades which I accepted sadly. The room they assigned me was the smallest they had and not acceptable For parents needs. I asked about upgrades and options for additional points or for me to pay. He kept saying “I’m so sorry. There is nothing I can do” and kept saying they had no rooms avail. showed him online I could book a larger accessible room. I even offered to book it to show him. He said they would have to charge me if I booked online. It was now 2 hours of me pleading and 10pm. He offered to cancel my booking as a favor. That’s when I went off. I demanded a true manager who knew better. . I forgot to mention he was only at the hotel 1 week from a Marriot Arizona NOT top tier and never had worked at a Ritz or any 5 stAr hotel. Another 30 minutes went by. Mom roaming the lobby in her wheelchair and dad sleeping.  Rachel a front office manager then enters and said I hear you want to upgrade. She gave me a cost and I said done. It didn’t matter at that point honestly of the cost. It mattered that she worked at the Wynn towers Vegas and understood my needs and was there to make me happy. Now the room was a little off. No closet to hang in 2nd bedroom and little things that were very strange however they did bring flowers and a fruit bouquet (parents anniversary)as an apology a few days later though they never did bring me drawers promised to put my clothing away and housekeeping I was not overly impressed with. There is no perks at all at this hotel. Not a thing. The pools and gym are not impressive however the location for shopping is amazing.

Despite repeated promises, that never happened. When we returned to our room after a long day out after traveling, we waited till midnight for the only housekeeper on duty to find some pillow covers and sheets. Next, the luggage rack in the room was broken. We had to call down three times for a replacement and it was still not delivered after 6 hours (despite repeated promises). We had to change rooms because it smelled like smoke (hotel is non-smoking). When I raised this concern, the desk manager questioned why we hadn’t reported it when we first arrived earlier in the afternoon (and walked up to our room to confirm it was true before agreeing to move us). Also, they were pushing us to upgrade our ""small"" room for an additional $100 per day.    Check out was even worse. I am a platinum member and typically get 4 pm check outs. I had a 4 PM flight the next day, so I asked for an additional hour. They only agreed to give me till 12:30. 12:10 came around and there was a knock at my door. Rude Housekeeper. I advised I would be leaving at 12:30 as agreed. No problem. Not 5 minutes later, another person that looked like a manager or security knocked and entered and asked me if I “planned on checking out.” When I told him the same thing, he apologized. He then proceeded to tell me that he would go “verify” with the front desk (as if I was misrepresenting to him) and lectured me on how I should put my privacy hanger on the door if I didn’t want to be bothered.

The apartment is cleaned twice daily by very competent housekeeping staff. Wifi signal is strong and fast.

731020574,10,“Can’t do attitude” Just consider this review If you are Marriott elite or boom with amex fine hotels,"Out of many reviews, this is only one of two that I have rated below 4 stars. The hotel looks very nice, but I’m writing based on my experience booking with the hotel. I received an email in advance of my stay, as I always do when I stay at a Ritz. However, this email outlined some “rules” they have about elite travelers. It outlines that, because it is a residence, that they would not honor some Bonvoy benefits. I understand that it’s important to let people know that in advance if they choose not to give people benefits, but the email rubbed me the wrong way for a property where I was going to spend nearly $1,500 for two nights. The email indicated that they were not going to honor the benefits from the Amex fine hotels program. They said I would not get breakfast, when that come with Amex fine hotel bookings. They said I wouldn’t get an upgrade, which comes when it’s available with a fine hotel booking. They said I couldn’t get a late checkout, even though that’s guaranteed with a fine hotel booking. I was disappointed in my interactions because I emailed them and asked if this was just a template email, and they said that they would honor those benefits. Then, I emailed later about the upgrade. They again said they wouldn’t honor an upgrade, contradicting the email they had sent earlier. To their credit, they refunded my money because I was disappointed with my interactions with them. But, I’m now ambassador level with Marriott, and they were not respectful and sent inconsistent messages to me. Considering what I’ve spent with Marriott and the number of nights I’ve stayed with Marriott, I’m offended by my treatment at this hotel. They even knew that I was bringing a close friend who lists her husband to cancer to celebrate his life because he wasn’t able to make it for his 60th birthday. I expect a lot from a hotel in Hawaii because of how nice and hospitable people here are. I expect even more from a Ritz, because it’s my favorite brand and has awesome service.

I have asked if they can provide the courtesy room to change my cloths since I just have arrived at Honolulu from Japan. There is no courtesy room so they asked me to change at the rest room so I went in to the rest room but the rest room floor was so dirty that I didn't want to change it.  Room:  There is a book how to use the facilities in the room. In the book, there was a explanation how to use the wash and dryer. So I have looked for it but I could not find them so I asked if they could come to inform me where located. When the lady came, she look for it and told me there is none so she would change the room for me. But after she checked up my reservation, my room doesn't have these facilities.  The only thing they have to do was to take out these explanations from the booklet.  Breakfast  We went to the breakfast around 9 am. Most of the menu was sold out!!!

We had looked at various options for renting a condominium while vacationing there and chose the Ritz as we did not want any surprises. This location is a little different from the other Ritz Carlton properties we have stayed at because of the condominium style rooms. But the service and facilities are all up to the standards we expect for a Ritz Carlton and we enjoyed it very much. We had a two bedroom unit and the set up of that suite is very nice with two king size beds and two ensuite bathrooms. It included a small but very modern kitchen which suited us fine since we were not planning any major meal preparation.

727398633,50,Excellent hotel in a good location,"Wow! That was my very first impression on seeing the hotel and my room! I was very impressed with this hotel and the professionalism of all of the staff. The rooms are large, extremely well-equipped and super clean. I was greeted with an orchid lei and then with a welcome drink - you don’t see that too often anymore! I had an ocean view room with lovely views.

726245907,10,Disappointing Stay as a Titanium Guest,"Currently staying at the resort and have not been satisfied with my stay. Robin at the pool was helpful as was Benjamin in Valet. Titanium status is not recognized. I had observed a different titanium guest receive additional amenities such as a room upgrade, a pool cabana stay which was complementary as of September of 2019. We were not offered any amenities this stay, not breakfast, not bonus points or anything. The front desk manager, Mary Jane assured we would have a late check out at 4 PM, when I called to confirm the next day the front desk staff was not aware of it. It created hiccups throughout our stay and did not make it enjoyable. For this price point, I would expect everything to fall in place, the Ritz Honolulu falls short. When we arrived at the resort at 1:30 PM, we were told a room upgrade was available for a fee but not complementary. I feel like if the room is available, why not offer it to a guest, the manager told me the reason is because those are residences that are owned. They are not complementary but we could purchase the upgrade even though they are vacant. We had to wait for our bags from the bellman and arrange our bag in the lobby while a room was available and vacant. So bottomline is Titanium status is not recognized at this hotel and I would certainly not stay here again. I have received more recognition and upgrades at the Westin and Marriott as Titanium. Extremely disappointed.",Nov 2019,November 2019,Traveled on business,,"Seattle, Washington"
726053772,40,Nice- but not that special,"I was in town for work, I chose this location because I thought it would be a more premium experience (quiet, specialized service, etc) than a hotel that caters to tourists. First, I was disappointed in the location of the hotel. On the map it looks much closer to the water. It is a short walk, to Waikiki beach, but the views are actually to the West, and the water is further away. So, you see a lot more city in between. Speaking of city- the traffic noise is pretty loud. I was on an upper floor, but it was still surprised how loud the street noise was from the balcony. The good news is the sliding doors are very high quality- and noise was not an issue when they were closed. I did notice and appreciate that detail.    As for the room, it was nice- but really just sort of average for an upper-end property. Meaning, if I hadn't known it was a Ritz, I would have thought it just a nicer Marriott or Westin. The bed was super comfortable and it was nice to have the mini kitchen, it was still a very small room and you could also hear noise from the hallway. Again, on my profile, I ask for upper floors and rooms away from the elevator, so my room didn't quite fit that profile and I was surprised the room was so galley style. (as in, one long narrow space)  Service by hotel staff was great-- with the exception of the front desk when we checked in. A pretty chilly reception and the first thing annouced was: there are no upgrades! (OK, thanks, we didn't ask for one)    So, overall, a nice place, and while I could normally balance out the non-beach location for the service, in this case, it didn't work out and I can't say I would recommend this hotel.",Nov 2019,November 2019,Traveled on business,"Rooms face west, so the sunset is lovely.

725783752,50,Fabulous,"We cannot say enough good things about this hotel. The staff are wonderful and welcoming from first stepping foot on the property. We were greeted with leis and personally escorted to the check in desk. We received a welcoming drink and a towel to refresh ourselves as we completed check in. During our week, everyone was friendly, positive and extremely helpful. The room was beautiful and serviced a couple times a day, with water replenished daily and chocolates by the bed at night.  We will definitely return and perhaps try another Ritz at their other destinations.",Nov 2019,November 2019,Traveled as a couple,,"Prescott, Arizona"
725764428,50,The best place I have stayed in Waikīkī,"I'm looking at buying a vacation rental on O'ahu. Unfortunately, O'ahu recently passed an ordinance limiting the neighborhoods where short term rentals are allowed: Waikīkī, Ko Olina (leeward side) and the North Shore. The prices in Ko Olina are higher vs what I want to spend (more than $1 million), and North Shore is far. So I focused my efforts on condotels in Waikīkī. The Ritz is very new, and in my price range: I gave it a test drive.    Pros: The service was excellent. Yokina kept me posted regarding when my room would be ready; Big room (667 sf) with a large bathroom w/ two sinks, door for toilet, Toto washlet w/ remote control, a dinette, kitchen and two TVs; Firm bed; Large lanai; Sydney at the pool was supah nice. She hails from LA, but embodies the aloha spirit; Speaking of the pool, there are two. One for adults and one for kids. The adult has two jacuzzis and cabanas for rent; Spa and fancy restaurant on site; Large gym, but I would prefer a water machine vs little water bottles (be green); Close to Ala Moana, Foodland & Zippys, IMP and the strip (Kalakāuā).    Cons: Far from the beach; I stayed in the Diamond Head (East) tower. You have to check in at the Ewa (West) tower, and walk to the DH tower; I stayed in 1510. You have to traverse a long walkway that overlooks a parking lot. Not good for someone who doesn’t like heights; Gap under the front door that lets light in. The bed is right by the door.    In summary, the pros are way better vs the cons. The cost was $620/night (Nov), which was $10 more vs Trump. However, in my mind, the Ritz is nicer vs the Trump bc the room is bigger, the bed is firmer, it has a better pool, and the gym is larger. I’m doing the math to see if I can generate sufficient cash flow to make a Ritz condotel work. However, if I do not buy, the Ritz will be my no ka oi (number #1) place to stay in Waikīkī.",Nov 2019,,,,"Los Angeles, California"
723648133,50,Amazing,Soo impressed with this hotel. Everything was perfect with the room. Never been soo relaxed in a hotel. Felt more like being in your own apt. Housekeeping was fantastic and they really thought of everything even providing laundry detergent. Pool is quite small but I like the way they enforce the adults only rule in one if them.  The only negative point I will raise is that we were offered an upgrade only to find the actual room offered at a cheaper rate than we paid on the ‘Ritz’ website. Not impressed as we were made to feel like we were getting a deal. As long term Ritz Carlton visitors all over the world I expect honesty.

I was first introduced to you name brand as a youth and I have stayed at locations such as the one in Herzliya (Tel Aviv), Israel. You definitely did not disappoint. The grounds were spotless and the infinity pool and jacuzzi were exactly what I needed for a good break.

This Ritz-Carlton should be on the top of your list if you stay in Waikiki Beach, Honolulu, Oahu, HI. What it has over any hotel there is that it is new (opened within the last three years). Most is not all other hotels have been there forever and it shows, both inside and out. If that matters, stay here. The luxury in this Ritz-Carlton is second to none.

720931166,50,Need to experience! Boujee,"Although it is the most luxurious place you could stay it is worth every penny! Our uber driver said that even Trump stays here as oppose to his own hotel in Waikiki. Every room comes with a kitchenette and ocean view. They are so personable. I had a fever one day and they sent up Advil for me as well as a get well soon card and checked on me like three times. The day our dryer was broken they did all our laundry and packaged it up so nicely bringing it to the room. If we ever needed cream, butter, a band aid whatever it be they had it and brought it up to the room. The rooms even come with sewing kits, dental kits and shaving kits. They were always very helpful with directions and I've never encountered such happy staff. Although I must say Hawaii had the nicest and happiest people I have ever met. The pool and hot tub area is open until 2200 and it is never over crowded and always well kept. In fact one side is for families and the other for adults only. You have a breath taking view from this hotel and I encourage everyone to stay here at least once. Parking is valet only $40 usd a day very pricey but you get what you pay for. If it isn't your first time to Waikiki I don't even think you need a car.

I wish they had QQ beds here but i dont think they do- if you are traveling with a family member or friend you will have to sleep in the tiny twin beds or a king with pull out sofa. The AC is perfect, feels clean and worked well. I had lunch in the restaurant it was good but very expensive. The breakfast was not good at La Vie, my eggs and entire plate was cold but i was so happy to be there i didnt care. The in room coffee is great. The pool is open and you can swim at night and what a view. We had a great cabana in the kids side of the pool and my family got to visit and hang out for the afternoon. I loved this place it was hard to leave. I would definitely stay here again. The people lining up every morning at Dean and Deluca cracked me up.

Long-winded review, but worth your time:)","We changed our plans last minute, originally planned 5 nights in Maui, after our stay at the Ko’Olina Marriott Resort.    I won’t be repetitive of other reviews, but I will say that the location is perfectly located, walking distance to shops/restaurants.  Now, the staff? We’ve been to several high end properties, don’t know if I’m allowed to mention the four seasonal ones? This is absolutely THE BEST!  Valet staff, Front Desk, especially Ward, were amazing!  The pool staff, was impressive. THEY TRULY ENFORCE THE ADULTS ONLY POLICY, which was appreciated, especially when a family of very loud adults, then the baby showing up, were kindly informed of the family pool, and ushered to the area. Noah, thanks so much for making dinner reservations possible, and the personal note we received upon our return to the room. . Ocean, you are amazing, and Sydney, thanks for being you! And yes, they pamper you with sunscreen, sorbets, etc.  MARY JANE, we don’t have enough words to thank you for absolutely everything! You handled a couple of hiccups that were totally out of your control as a true pro! You went above and beyond your title as Club Services Manager.

707185300,50,Look no further than The Ritz Residences Waikiki Beach,"My family of 6 arrived for a 5-night stay and were immediately catered to starting w/ the valet, the bellmen and then personally greeted by reception as we got out of the car. We were then escorted to the elevator to the front desk and personally greeted by the GM. We were able to check into one of the rooms immediately but the 2nd one we had to wait for since we requested connecting rooms. While we waited for Room #2 we enjoyed the new Italian resto on sit (separate review to follow). I requested a complimentary upgrade due to our Titanium Bonvoy status along w/ the fact that we were celebrating several occasions (daughter going to UHM, grandson's 1st birthday & anniversary) and the Ritz was able to accommodate us. When we went into our upgraded rooms we walked into Room #1 that already had a pack-n-play, high chair AND complimentary 1) toys for my grandson; 2) a slice of birthday cake; and 3) fresh fruit plate. The bed was also beautifully decorated with flowers indicating the number of years of our anniversary. In Room #2 room service stopped by and delivered complimentary champagne and macarons. The Ritz definitely knows how to pamper their guests and I will definitely look no further when it comes to places to stay in Waikiki! The only con I would say was the bed was just a little too soft for our taste but all the pros trump the one con. Rooms were very spacious; balcony was perfect size just wish they had a foot rest w/ the patio chairs; kitchen we hardly used except for the Nespresso, microwave and fridge but seemed adequately stocked w/ the necessary tools; washer/dryer was definitely used. Gym was good and had complimentary bottled water. Service was super friendly and not in your face. Once they know your name, they remember you for the duration of your stay which is so classy and impersonal. STAFF are all so helpful and at your beck and call if needed. The Valet are also super friendly and don't have their hands out for tips. Housekeeping did a great job so I made sure I left a little $$ daily for my appreciation. Also, one thing I found interesting but did not have a problem with is that gratuity is automatically added if charging to your room and the server makes sure they tell you. The GM Douglas Chang is obviously doing a great job...kudos!    As a Titanium Bonvoy members we had some perks (see pic).    I have already booked another 6 days for April 2020.

699115318,10,No help,"What can a say other than a disappointing stay. So far it’s been not so good and everyday it gets a little worse.  Lots of lip service & none sense talk honestly we have not heard anything like it, so fake it hurts.  Have to eat at other hotels as the kitchen can’t knock up a gluten free meal.  We contacted the hotel ahead of schedule to ensure gluten free meals were available. We were advised that there were GF meals and that the hotel is accommodating by customising meals where possible if they are not specifically gluten free. On arrival we have found this to be a lie. The room service manager has tried to help us and has gone out of her way to get us some meals and some GF pasta. However when I tried to order lunch today the kitchen at the restaurant told us they couldn’t help us and recommended we spoke to Conceirge about finding somewhere else to eat. Breakfast is really limited to GF toast and when we asked the chefs if they would do a pancake for our son they refused. We even went to a grocery store to buy a GF pancake mix and they refused to cook it. So we have been attending the Hilton Hotel instead for meals, we also asked for help from the area manager but they can’t help neither. This is a really painful experience.  To top it off we came back to the hotel pool this afternoon and moved one of the sun beds a few inches the pool attendant fell over herself to advise “ you are not allowed to move the sun beds”.

698953461,40,Great Stay!,"We loved our time at the Ritz-Carlton Residences. Rooms are beautiful, loved having in-room laundry with two kids in tow, everyone is very kind and accommodating.    Loved that the pool staff was there if you needed them but not overly pushy to sell food and beverage. Loved the delicious lemonade by the front desk-after coming in dusty from hikes it really hit the spot. Free ice cream by the pool every day made everyone happy.    Valet isn't an easy gig and everyone at the front is SO friendly and do a great job greeting every single guest.    The one small complaint was the housekeeping service was quite inconsistent. The front desk double checked upon our arrival that the bedding had been changed to hypoallergenic bedding per our request. Each day it was an adventure to see if I would wake up feeling stuffy (if the bedding had not been hypoallergenic) or completely clear (if they had followed directives). This changed daily. With two children, turn down service at 9:00PM doesn't work for us and on our first two days, room service didn't arrive until 4:30PM. Some days it was a professional Ritz Carlton quality job, some days not so much.    These are true first world problems that were easily solved with nasal spray and a bit of patience. Overall it was a delightful stay and we would stay here again.",Aug 2019,July 2019,,,"Brooklyn, New York"
698723226,40,Beautiful accommodations and nice ocean view,"We enjoyed our stay at the Ritz Carlton Residences in Waikiki recently. We were 3 adults in a one bedroom suite. The suite was beautifully appointed, very modern and clean. We had plenty of room and a nice lanai to see the ocean. We were very comfortable. The bathroom is spacious. The elevators were very fast so it was no problem staying on a higher floor. The service was wonderful and everyone was helpful and gracious. We had a door come off a runner and the maintenance crew responded quickly and fixed it quickly. The location is great for restaurants and shopping. We walked to different restaurants most nights. The breakfast in the restaurant was good but the selection was small. There were 2 negatives for us. The first is that the pools and the surrounding decks are very small. Several times we found that all the chairs were taken for both pools and the only option would be to pay a hefty fee for one of the cabanas. This does not make sense when all you want are chairs for an hour or two near the end of the day. So basically almost none of the cabanas were taken. The family pool was very crowded since it was still the school holidays. The second negative is that it is a 10-15 minute walk to the nearest beach through the park. It's a nice but narrow beach and you have to rent chairs and umbrellas ($40-50 a day) and there is no reserved site for Ritz guests. The property is new and very nice but depending on your priorities it may or may not be the best place to stay.",Aug 2019,August 2019,,,"Los Gatos, California"
697816000,50,Fantastic full service hotel in great location - very spacious rooms w/ high end amenities,"We are not typically fancy hotel ppl - but, this place got us... it is in a great location too! Yes, not beachfront and I did struggle with that as I am a total beach nut! And to sit on an oceanfront balcony would have been the bomb ... but, we had that in Maui the previous week and I couldn't pass up all the amenities this place had to offer. I am not a big city gal but I was so pleasantly surprised at how I enjoyed walking down a few blocks to amazing shopping and restaurants - at 9 PM deciding I want an ice cream - no problem - 3 block walk! LOL  The Fort DeRussey park across the street is a lovely green space that trully made this spot perfect - it cut down on all the city noises that would have been a distraction in any other place and it was a pleasant 7 min walk to the beach.  The concierge on ground level by valet will have your beach bags ready with towels and some cold bottled water.  We booked on points for 240K for 5 nights - (5th night free!); parking was $40 day. We were upgraded to a Grand ocean view King too! Compared to the other Marriotts in Waikiki I feel I got the most value here with my points.  Our room was spacious with a full galley kitchen with Miele appliances including an awesome Espresso machine - love! We had a washer and dryer too - these were some top reasons we stayed here - being in Hawaii for 11 days we needed to do laundry and also to be able to have a kitchen for a quick breakfast, snack or evening glass of wine on my balcony was the ticket!  We had king bed in middle of suite and then living area had a sectional sleeper sofa.  The bathroom was spectacular!! It had a separate water closet with a heated seat bidet complete with a remote control!! My son was in love!? lol Double vanity, make up mirror, large soaking tub and walk in shower... lovely bath toiletries were replenished daily.  We had evening turn down service and twice daily our waters were restocked in our fridge.  Robes and slippers in our closet and plenty of storage space for clothing.  The kitchen was fully stocked - almost so that I had no where to put my groceries. We didn't buy a lot - but, every drawer and cabinet had dishes, pots, toasters, cutlery so I had to put my most of our food on small area around stove top. Perhaps they could put some shelving under the sink - there was a lot of dead area under there or a small pantry in the closet?  Parking is a steep $40 valet. But, they are courteous and prompt. You could get by with not having a car - but, for our first trip we wanted one. And it's in line w/ the high costs of Honolulu actually. The ground area where you exit building and also pick up car is very busy sometimes and honestly a poor design... ppl walk in front of cars and don't mind children running around - they should have had the elevators perhaps more shielded from this busy valet area.  Oh the elevators are the bomb! Fastest and most quiet ones we have ridden in and they are smart! No buttons inside! My son loved them - you use your key card to get in them and tell it where you want to go...  Two infinity pools on the lobby floor - Floor 9 - where you will also find two restaurants and the spa.  One adult - which we didn't use because we had our son and the family pool.  Each have free sunscreen and towels and also typically a bowl of apples (not the best though). We used that sunscreen every day as I underestimated how much to bring for 11 days!  The restaurants are very pricey as to be expected for a resort and in Honolulu. We got drinks and dessert from the pool bar and then had breakfast in the main restaurant by the lobby. It was very very slow service and not full - I believe they were understaffed... this was unfortunate as we were pressed to check out and get to airport. Breakfast for 3 -$115!  The Ritz does not guarantee upgrades or late check outs for elite members. But, we did a nice upgraded room and they did give us a noon check out...  The only real hiccup in our stay was our last morning there - we had hope to sleep in as we had a red eye flight and would be traveling for almost 24 hours to get home... well, 6:15 maid is knocking on door saying ""housekeeping""... ummmm... hello, what?? She gives us two bags of toiletries!? Ok, but we don't need these and why are you waking us up!??! I guess it was a mistake - but,a costly one for us as we could not get back to sleep!! This really added to an already very long day for us... a few hours later I called front desk to ask why they woke us up so early? She finds out it was a mistake and apologizes - I ask for later check out - she cannot give it but I manage to get $100 room credit - which paid for most of our breakfast. Still would have rather had the sleep and late check out as our trip home was so very long and difficult.    I would stay again - just gotta save some more points - could never afford it otherwise!!",Aug 2019,July 2019,,,"Mobile, Alabama"

We had room at corner which only had 4 rooms and it was very quiet and close to the elevators.  Our room on 17th floor faced the beach and overlooking the pool area. We enjoyed our morning coffees on the balcony and watching the sunset. Very large bathroom with separate toilet was big plus, small kitchen area, and nice room divider (sliding panel) to separate the sofa bed from the king bed.  All the staff from valet, front desk, poolside, house keeping were polite. Just love the housekeeping service who did the morning/afternoon cleaning and then evening turn down! They kept the supplies right on ques!  Definitely we will come back when we visit Oahu again near future. Thank you!",Jul 2019,June 2019,Traveled with family,,"Los Angeles, California"
693547434,50,5 star yes..... however service rescued it from 4 star,"A great few days at the Ritz Carlton, which has been great throughout from Ward who checked us in and shared a load of great local recommendations for activities and eating and drinking to Ali at the bar chatty, friendly and also with great restaurant and bar recommendations to Heather pool side who was super efficient and really genuinely friendly also John the pianist, seems to know every song you could possible want. On the basis of these folks and others what a great stay.    Room great, stayed in 2305, housekeeping on point and everything well maintained and in good order.    Al fresco Bar superb helped by Ali and great views and amazing cocktails.    Spa used a couple of times for a hot stone massage and for a body scrub treatment both great. Spa area is very calm and well appointed, therapists were skilled and attentive.    Restaurant we only used once for a breakfast and my only negative point in this review, service was as everywhere else excellent but the food was average at best spinach mushroom omelette looked very pre prepared and tasted ok, we did not use the restaurant again.    Would definitely stay here again, if we find ourselves back in Waikiki for the bar, the rooms, the service, the spa and the pool but not for the food.",Jul 2019,July 2019,Traveled as a couple,,"London, United Kingdom"

691134428,40,Great Hotel Rooms,"Spent 2 nights at the Ritz Carlton Residences in June. The hotel rooms are spacious and nice. We had two rooms -- each with a king bed and a pull out sofa. The pull out sofa bed got rave reviews from our 11 year old. The room has a few cooking options and a washer/dryer which is fantastic when on a long trip. (I wish we had known before the trip!)    The hotel has two pools - one for adults only and one for kids. The kids pool is nicely laid out but we wish it was bigger or that the kids could have used the adult side too (maybe just call it a quiet pool). We had a few snacks and drinks at the poolside bar. All were fantastic. And the bartender was really attentive and positive. (Unfortunately, I didnt catch her name.)    The check in was great -- the front desk team was so nice and they deftly handled some very needy guests with efficiency and kindness.    The hotel is not on the beach -- you need to walk to the beach. we walked the beach, played in the water a bit, explored some of the hotels there -- and decided that compared to most the Ritz was much nicer and more well kept.    it rained a ton while we were there but we enjoyed Leonards malasadas for breakfast, the Pig and the Lady for dinner, and Poke Bar for lunch. We shopped a bit in town too, walked up Diamond Head.    I think if i went back, i would probably try to stay on the beach at the halekulani but the ritz is a great option too and a bit quieter and much more refined than most of the other hotels in the city.",Jul 2019,June 2019,Traveled with family,higher floors for views of the park.,"Washington DC, District of Columbia"

Guest relations emailed me prior to our arrival and helped me setup in room dining, a cabana reservation at the pool and let me request a crib for my infant son. So awesome!    Upon arrival guest services left a handwritten card and a mini cake in the fridge wishing my husband a very happy birthday! At the pool cabana, Jamal, brought toys for my son and extra swim diapers just in case. The staff at this hotel go above and beyond. Exceptional service, thank you for making our stay great!    Our room was spacious. It had a mini kitchenette with full size fridge/freezer, microwave and sink. Very convenient when traveling (even for just a staycation) with an infant.

The rooms are a little boring but clean. and the high floors have amazing views of the park and ocean.    The only place I ate in the hotel is Sushi Sho which is amazing. There is a Dean & Deluca downstairs which is great for breakfast.    The hotel seems to be a bit understaffed so services are slow but the service is great. The concierge's are amazing, especially David who managed to make a few impossible things happen. The location of the hotel is great as you can walk everywhere easily.

688126709,50,The Ritz Carlton Way,"This was my 3rd time at a Ritz Carlton property and I must say they know how to do customer service. Sometimes at high end resorts the staff will exhibit an elitist attitude. Not so at the Ritz! Everyone is treated equally and with the utmost attention. This property was awesome. Since these units are individually owned, they come with a kitchenette and a washer dryer. These were essential for our 10 night stay. We could pack lighter knowing we could wash easily and having a mini kitchen allowed us to have our own beverages and snacks handy when we did not want to go out to eat. It also allowed us to bring ""home"" leftovers from the many fabulous places we had dinner. We grabbed breakfast in our room most mornings.  Love that there was a family and adult pool. The family pool looked like a lot of fun, but it had the most people. The adult pool was quiet and relaxing with a great view of the ocean, even though you are a few blocks from the beach. The pool overlooks Fort Derussy and Hale Koa (military resort), so you have an unobstructed view to the water.  We have family military that we were visiting, so we visited and ate at Hale Koa a couple times. Its also an easy walk to the bustling Waikiki beach area. We walked to most restaurants.  We only ate at the Market restaurant, which serves the poolside also. On the expensive side of course (you pay for convenience) but not out of line as Waikiki is an expensive area.    We traveled with our youngest adult son. He slept on the sofa bed that was turned down each night, so that eliminates the hassle of a sofa bed. Sliding doors create a separate room at night for privacy.    Bathroom is large and modern. Toilet is latest and greatest. It lights up when you walk into the commode area! Heated and equipped with spray heads and a dryer for your ""business""    My only suggestion:Switch to regular Keurig machines in the rooms! The Expresso machines just don't make a good cup of coffee!    We used Bonvoy points for our stay, and the Ritz was the same number of points as the Sheraton Waikiki. Sheraton is on the beach, but I never felt I was missing anything staying here!",Jul 2019,June 2019,Traveled with family,All rooms have an ocean view.,"Marietta, Georgia"
687599113,50,Splendid Stay,"Before we arrived, I received an email welcoming us and asking for our arrival details. This was a first for me for a US based hotel. All of my feedback was noted and followed through.    Upon arrival we were greeted with leis and our luggage was later delivered to us. We had to wait awhile before we could check in due to the long queue which was the only complaint we had during our entire stay. When we finally accessed our room there was a nice welcoming note along with a large tray of fresh fruit.    Staff service was excellent with majority of staff somehow remembering our names throughout our stay and displaying lots of aloha spirit. Todd was very helpful each time we met him from showing us our room, providing restaurant recommendations and giving advice on things to do. There were a lot more people deserving of recommendation but I did not always catch their names from the single interaction.    We were upgraded to a deluxe room with an unobstructed view of the ocean and enjoyed our sizable lanai overlooking the pool. Room was rectangular with a lot of features packed inside. It had a roomy feel with a big bathroom and sliding room separator to isolate the luxurious twin beds (unusual) from the pull out sofa bed. Both sections had their own TVs and in the main area a compact table and dresser. The kitchen was fully outfitted including the small two burner cooktop and exhaust fan (excellent filtering and no after smell when we fried up a bunch of Portuguese sausages and eggs for breakfast). A Nespresso coffee maker was restocked with pods each day. A handy washer and dryer was also tucked away but that was a little noisy when in use. The nice part was unlimited detergent packs were supplied so we were able to do all of our laundry.    The bath had two sinks with lots of counter space, a separate room for the toilet (which was outfitted with a high end electronic seat (Toto?) with built in warmer and water jets) and walk in shower with soaking tub. The towels and robes were plush and plentiful. Toiletries were very nice.    Parking was $40 per night which was on par with other hotels in the area. Staff was quick in retrieving our car each time and gave a lot of good advice for traffic conditions or parking suggestions.    The pool was crowded in the late morning and afternoons but excellent for swimming laps in the early morning. The adult and children pools were separate with beach chairs, umbrellas and some cabanas.    The gym was well equipped with a lot of cardio and weights. I wish I could have used it more.    Unfortunately there was no executive lounge or beach front. The beach was a short 10 minute walk away and the concierge desk had beach bags packed with towels and water to go so this was handy.

687409249,40,Overall good room quality,"Arrival experience really is a terrible miss. Because of the location, the turn in is a bit difficult to find. After that, are you escorted to another level for actual check in. Since it’s not a big area, there are always people waiting and my total arrival experience lasted almost half an hour before I was actually checked in. In the modern day and age, all this wait is very unnecessary, tiring, and a bit demotivating given the esteem of the brand. Upon checking with the front desk officer, we would be replied: sorry please wait for your turn there are a few people first. Like an actual food court, not 6 star hotel.    The experience to go to Diamond tower is also a bit confusing, but it takes only a little bit to get used to how to navigate the building. The room is fortunately nicely planned, with modern bathroom fit out. Can’t fault the room and room services. Overall my only comment is the complexity of the check in / out process.

This is a high end “condo hotel” with impeccable customer service.    Since it was our first time staying there, we accidentally pulled up to the wrong valet stand. The staff rushed over to help us anyway, then politely advised us to turn right into the driveway next time. We were greeted with leis, taken up to the lobby by a staff member and given refreshing drinks. There was no waiting to check in and staff personally took us to the elevators. High tech “individualized” elevators took us up to our room which had an incredible view of the ocean and Waikiki skyline.    We were in a studio, but it had a compact efficient kitchen with Miele appliances. The hotel has infinity pools with breathtaking views and separate pool areas for adults only and another for families.

681252424,40,"Beautiful spacious quiet hotel, a little far from the beach","This hotel is big and spacious and beautiful, and everything you expect from a premium experience at a Ritz-Carlton. I had some flight issues that kept changing, and the staff went above and beyond to make sure everything was smooth for our arrival (which all happened at different times). The pools were beautiful and had great views, and had the bonus of being open 24 hours, which was a nice and unexpected bonus! I would recommend this hotel for a family looking for large, apartment-style rooms who like quiet in the evening and don't care about nightlife.    The only reason this is a 4* review instead of 5* is purely based on location and how quiet (aka boring) the hotel was in the evenings. Although our room was high up and gave us views of the beach, we were very far from it. Furthermore, the hotel bar closed very early and there was absolutely no one around in the evening. Waikiki is a fun place and there were lots of bars down the street, but the Ritz was just a littttttle too far to be convenient to either the beach or nightlife. We were young women and it wasn't the most exciting place to stay.

I'd like to especially mention Jaime at the concierge desk who offered amazing recommendations for our drive around the island (the car was organized through the hotel as well!) as well as Mika and Josh at the check-in desk who offered a warm welcome anytime we walked past on our way to our suite in the Diamond Head tower.

679741519,50,Home Sweet Aloha Home :),"Okay, wow. I am on the road a TON and usually never unpack as it's just easier to literally live out of my suitcase. My flight landed around lunch time, I was in an Uber, got checked in, and up to my room efficiently. My plan was to drop my bag, run to the beach, take a swim/float, and get to a late afternoon meeting.    The game changer for me was that I fell in LOVE with my room (original tower, 10th floor, deluxe ocean view, studio, 1 King, sofa bed, balcony). So much so that I unpacked to the point that my suitcase is put away empty.    In Waikiki I have stayed at the Marriott, Courtyard, Embassy Suites, Prince, and Hilton Hawaiian Village -- this property is aces for specific reasons to what I love in a hotel experience. I'm writing this review about 19 hours after checking in and still learning but just had to share how lucky it feels to be experiencing this brand of love so far.    You arrive a level below the front desk check-in. Maria was lovely and was one of several and took me up to registration and handed me over. Mary Jane at the front desk was efficient and attuned to the joy of her ""office"" view. I did notice that cold towels and mini-pink beverages of some sort were being presented to some but it was a bit busy and Mary Jane was pretty swift so I didn't connect to that.    I am attaching photos of the washer/dryer as that was one thing that I had been chirping about to my pals or any one who would listen as the thing i was most curious about. I've been on the road, so after unpacking I did my first wash. So fun!!!  Other reviews have pictures and thoughts on the room so I won't be redundant. I will say that the space/layout is unique and so you might find yourself walking back and forth orienting to the length/size of the room. Also the balcony is one that has privacy. You can be out there without someone from the left or right looking right at you.    I have friends and family on island and usually meet up with them at favorite restaurants. The wonder of this room is that we will likely go to the Dean & DeLuca (7 am to 9 pm) downstairs and takeout so that we can visit in my little living room slice of wonderfulness! Giddy with the fact that I am an ice fan and that the ice maker creates this fun sized ice. Easy turn off button in case the sound of it dropping occasionally would wake you.    Also, regarding the walk to the beach - first, the black bag with two towels is great (thank you Trechnet - I know I am spelling it wrong and blaming it on jet lag :) -- who hipped me to the bag, directions, and well wishes for fun! I will recycle the towels and use a beach bag for day two as it was so handy for day one but think I'll use mine to fit more things. The kiosk at the beach that isn't related to the Ritz but very helpful explained the lounger/umbrella system. It seems like for about $35 ish I could be set up for a good part of the day with a lay down chair and umbrella. There was an outdoor shower and bathroom in the area directly down Saratoga from the hotel.    Finally, others have mentioned Sumin Lee and this expanded review would not be complete without special mention as well! Having someone who I could be in touch with by email before, during, and after is incredibly valuable to me. Travelling solo on this trip and it makes all the difference to have a sense of community.    Globally I have had the beauty of staying at pretty remarkable properties but can easily say that the word that came up for me regarding this property is UNPARALLELED.

From the moment we stumbled out of the taxi to be greeted with leis and a smoothie, this was an incredible property.    They were cheerfully able to accommodate our request for an early check-in. Our residence was spacious and delightfully appointed - my teenage kids found the heated toilet seat and bidet functions particularly enjoyable, lol.    I had the best massage of my life at the spa, including a post-massage serving of sorbet in the “Relaxation Room” and some very kind and helpful ladies at the main desk of the spa.    The pool was GORGEOUS. The room service was fast and delish. And the complimentary beach towels and water bottles at the concierge made our beach visit perfect.    And a very special shout-out to Sumin Lee who helped to coordinate the delivery of some very important prescription drugs for my daughter, and gave me so much peace of mind knowing that this sensitive and crucial aspect of our stay was handled with care and professionalism.

671740570,50,Fantastic property-Best use of Marriott Points ever!,"So a couple of caveats to start the review. I stayed at this property April 29th to May 4th, five nights using 240,000 Marriott Points. As some of you may know, if you book five nights you pay for four nights and get the fifth night free. So even though it costs 60,000 points a night it actually breaks down to 48,000 points a night which is a bargain considering suites go from $500-$800 a night.    The second caveat is that I was there to decompress after a death in the family two months ago and I just needed to get away. I have previously been to Oahu and done all of the tourist things so the main purpose of this trip was to relax and have some good local food.    I travel extensively though I have never stayed at Ritz Carlton property before. After this trip it would be hard to stay anywhere else.    So that being said, I will begin my review in my usual style of Pros and Cons:    PROS    1. The employees. From Tomoko and Josh at the Front Desk, to Robin, Sequoia and Ocean at the pool to Wes in the bar, an outstanding group of individuals. Not only are they always pleasant to the guests, their interaction with each other is unique as well. Never have I been around so many friendly, wonderful outgoing individuals.    2. My Suite. I was on the 22nd floor of the Diamond Tower which is the slightly newer of the two buildings. Traveling by myself I had plenty of room and I could have easily brought two friends and we would all have been comfortable. Two HD TV's, a super comfortable king bed, and separate small living area with a pull out sofa, a stunning bathroom with glass shower, soaking tub, dual sinks, and a bidet.    3. Also included in my suite was a washer/dryer which meant I was able to pack very light. A refrigerator, microwave/oven, dishes, silverware etc, wine glasses; all top quality items. A Nespresso machine and coffee pods which were restocked every day.    4. The lanai was huge and the views of the water every day was pristine.    5. There are two pools, one for adults only. There are only about 30 lounges but there was always one available. There were two hot tubs anchoring the pools.    6. A great fitness center with everything for a great workout (which I did daily). All the equipment was new and in perfect working order.    7. Approximate 10 minute walk to the beach through the park across the street.    8. Even though you are in Waikiki it was very quiet at this hotel.    Additional positives:    At 3 pm each day they serve a (very) small cup of ice cream at the kids pool. The flavor of the day is a locally made Hawaiian ice cream.    From 3 pm-6 pm each day, cocktails, beer, wine, small bites and salads are half price at the pool. For $8.00 you receive an excellent cocktail.    High speed internet is free and available to all guests.    NO RESORT FEE    Additionally, after you book this property you receive an email from customer service asking information about your arrival time and flight information. When I advised them I would not be getting to the hotel until around 9 pm. I was advised they would put a snack in the refrigerator as I might be hungry. That ""snack"" of fruit, cheese, chips, olives, meat and honey took me three days to finish.    When you arrive to check in you get a refreshing tropical beverage.    CONS:    Just to nitpick only a couple.    Strangely, there was no clock in my room. I had to ask twice for one and once they provided it, it didn't glow so if the room was dark you had no idea what time it was.    In the fitness center, in addition to every piece of cardio equipment having a TV, there are two large screen TV's for individuals lifting weights. However, there was no remote control to change the channels. After asking for a remote for a couple of days and not getting one, I would bring one of the two remotes from my suite which worked just fine.    I believe valet parking was $40 a night. I rented a car for one day $42 through Costco and parked on the Ala Wei Canal for free. You really don't need a car in Waikiki and their public transportation system is wonderful $2.75 one way or $5.50 for an all day pass. The transit system goes all over the island and to all the tourist destinations.    I could do a whole separate review on restaurants, but if you need specifics email me and I will let you know. I can tell you that I only ate in local places usually within two miles of the hotel for dirt cheap and wonderful food.    In conclusion two things. If you are a Marriott member, especially using points, this is hands down the best value on the island for the best service imaginable. I saw the other properties and for a few points less I wouldn't waste my time.    Second. Even though it never has occurred to me to spend $500 a night at a hotel, I would do so at this property if I don't have enough points when I come back. It was that remarkable.    Cheers!

671295602,50,Glad We Picked the Ritz,"With the Waikiki Ritz not being on the beach and the pool area being small, it’s not the obvious hotel choice when trying to decide where to stay. However, we were so pleased we picked this hotel and the lack of a beach or large pool was no issue at all.    We spent 4 nights at the Ritz using points. With Waikiki beach so over run with tourists and given that it’s a public beach with no alcohol (so no Mai Tai’s in your beach chair), we didn’t miss the beach at all. However, if you want a beach chair the concierge will set it up for you. We spent a couple of days lounging around the adult pool. And thank goodness for an adult only pool since there were so many families. The service at the pool was top notch- cocktail and food were both fantastic! We never had any issue getting two loungers, even thought the hotel was full since it was a big Japanese holiday week. However, I saw larger groups of 4+ have problems getting chairs since the pool area is small.    The rooms all have great views of the beach, Diamondhead, and the city skyline. The beds are wonderful. Bathrooms are spacious, with great Japanese toilets. We also took advantage of the in-room washer and drier and left at the end of our trip with a bag of clean clothes.    You are easy walking distance to great shopping, the beach, and some of the beachfront hotels and restaurants.    I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Waikiki- especially if you only have a couple of nights in town before moving on to one of the other islands or a cruise.",May 2019,May 2019,Traveled as a couple,,Japan

While we read some reviews from reviewers that didn't like the location a few blocks away from Waikiki beach, my husband and I loved this. You still had amazing ocean and sunset views, but the beach can be really crowded. The Ritz feels like it's an oasis from all of the crowds. It's beautifully designed and the pools are fantastic, as is the service. We were there for our anniversary and we were greeted with a Hawaiian cocktail, leis and a cold towel. Our room had a heart on the bed and flowers everywhere and a very sweet card with a delicious cake in the refrigerator. It was amazing.

All of the employees were professional and helpful and the accommodations were perfect. The suite was spacious with a separate seating and sleeping area and included a kitchen and a washer/dryer. Everything was high end quality and the room was kept spotlessly clean. I especially loved the extra large window above the soaking tub and walk in shower that allows you to enjoy the view of the ocean from inside the bathroom. The outdoor balcony pf my room was complete with chairs for lounging and enjoying the view. Although not located directly on the beach, I liked this location and enjoyed getting in some exercise each day while walking to and from the beach.

664084693,50,Outstanding!,"This hotel has the usual mix of exclusivity, customer service, and high standards that I’ve come to expect at all hotels, yet that only typically get delivered at a Ritz Carlton property.    We stayed at the Marriott Ko Olina earlier this week and despite a great location, were disappointed with the lack of quality. Moving to the ritz before our departure back home to California was a perfect end to the week.    Everything from checkin experience, to upgrade options, to service in dining / bar facilities has been perfect.    The room itself is usually outstanding quality. We had a 2 bed suite which is more than big enough for my wife and I and 2 kids. The kitchen is larger than you’d expect for a hotel, with large living area and dining table in the kitchen. Really well equipped with dishwasher and washing machine and dryer.    To quote my eldest daughter (aged 10), “Now this is more like it Daddy, why didn’t we just stay here all week”.    While location isn’t perfect (a short walk from the beach), i’ll be staying here on future trips to Oahu since you really can’t get this experience in terms of customer service at a Marriott vacation club property.

654716713,50,Outstanding!,"I'm actually quite shocked at people giving this property 3 stars or whatever - they are either too picky or expected a Burj al Arab - that's my view, anyway.    If there's an ideal place to spend your family vacation or an extended business trip in, it's this one. (But you pay the price, obviously). There's not a single aspect of this hotel that could prompt any sort of criticism (on my part - obviously, there are plenty of high-brow critics here, judging by some comments).    Contemporary design everywhere, high class just floating in the air, exceptionally well-trained and welcoming personnel, convenient location, spotless appearance, nice smell everywhere, all the little things like ""oh, we see you are going to the beach, here's a beach bag with towels and water for you"", room service twice a day, etc., etc.    We lived in a KS+retractable sofa room. It was spacious, with a sliding partition converting it into two bedrooms - with individual large-screen TVs in each. The bathroom was spacious, too, stocked with high-quality toiletries of every possible kind, open-space design with toilet separated by a semi-transparent door and equipped with a ""Japanese"" lid (you know, with bells and whistles and remote control). We also had a balcony - big enough to host two chez-longues and a coffee table.    The sleep quality was very good, even the convertible sofa felt like a proper bed. I have no idea what noise some people are complaining about - unless you sleep with the balcony door open, you won't hear traffic.    The room was fully equipped for a long stay: fully stocked kitchen (stove, oven, fridge, appliances, kitchenware - the only thing missing was a microwave), a washer and a dryer (!) and an adequate kitchen top. This was definitely a highlight of our stay because we were not restricted to going out for breakfast or dinner.    They have a decent pool, a spa and a gym. The gym was not as big as I'd expected, but still equipped well: 11 cardio machines, 5 strength machines, a full rack of dumbbells and a HIIT island with pulleys, harnesses, balls and even a punching bag. And, of course, stocked with chilled bottled water, dry and wet towels, disposable earphones, etc.    The place absolutely deserves top marks, without reservation.

A manager came up to check it out and we got switched promptly. A small hiccup to still an awesome stay. They had activities of a mochi making in bottom floor and drum. Nice fitness room and yoga room. Two pools which are clean and nicely attended. Famous sushi omakase need reservation for at hotel also. Also had ice cream at the pool they were giving out when we went.    The location was like a double edged sword. It is basically right on top of the street where all the main stores and shopping areas are for Honolulu and although it is not on the beach, it is walking distance which could be difficult with two small kids. 5 month and a 22 month. They have a bag with towels and water you can get from front desk if you ask.    To sum it up: I have stayed in several places in Honolulu- Hale Koa, Moana Surfrider, turtle beach resort in north shore, and outrigger Waikiki on the beach. Customer service at the ritz here was best overall. Rooms are big and clean. It felt personal and staff members all around remembered us when we came and went. Close enough to walk to the beach but not on the beach. Again another shoutout to Josh at front desk, Andrea, and Christian with engineering, and especially to the room service!

653339587,30,Disappointed Getaway,"I think this is a case where this could be the right hotel for the right person- and that person should rate the hotel higher than I can.    If you are here to explore Oahu, and plan on spending minimal time in the room and don’t mind a pool with a distant ocean view- this is the place for you. If you’re looking for a resort getaway away from city noise- stay somewhere else.    My husband and I were looking for a long weekend getaway to enjoy with a beautiful hotel room, a nice view, a beautiful pool to spend some adult time.    They have a beautiful pool, and an ocean view. However, between you and that beautiful view are a few blocks of Waikiki, which we knew. What we failed to anticipate is that those few blocks were the difference between beach and ocean vs city traffic and noise. We love relaxing on the balcony with a drink to watch the sunset, but if you try that here, the sunset will be accompanied with the loud noise of rush hour traffic and ambulances, fire trucks and construction. We came here to escape the city, not to be confronted by it from our room.    We stayed in the new tower, and though the room was very comfortable- we were surprised that they would build a place with tiny and shallow bathtubs and old shower heads that lacked water pressure. At $600 a night, I feel like that’s a basic ask.    More importantly, if you have a late flight and want to relax at the hotel pool for the day until it’s time to fly out, this isn’t be the best choice hotel. We are platinum elite, so that gives us the extra benefit of having 4 ok checkout when available. Since we had a 4:45 pm reservation nearby for sunset drinks, we asked if we could stay until 4:30 so we could max out on pool time before we leave. They couldn’t accommodate that, which is completely fair. We aren’t entitled to more time. So we said we’d be happy to check out earlier if we can just shower and get cleaned up in the hospitality suite or courtesy room- except... they don’t have one. I’m sorry- but a 5* hotel in a beach town like Honolulu, that doesn’t have a hospitality suite for changing and cleaning up before leaving? I’ve stayed at grand Wailea, four seasons (on multiple islands), all those hotels understand the importance of a hospitality suite for guests who are willing to checkout early but just need a place to cleanup and change out before they head out for a later flight. This is an island vacation, after all. It’s crazy to me that the Ritz doesn’t offer this pretty standard 5* amenity.    Also- they don’t do Bloody Mary’s at the bar. Credit to the bar staff for trying to put together a concoction for me off menu with tomato juice... but... really?!? Again- this feels nitpicky but c’mon I’m not asking for the exotic here, and I’m paying premium for room and drinks.    Last complaint- you have 3 pools. Please designate one as adult only. Recommend the medium size pool with the water lounge chairs, so if adults want to be close to their kids at the slide, they can do that. But other adults can still enjoy their drinks on the water lounge chairs without loud splashing kids spraying chlorine water into their drinks. If they need more room to play games, give them the largest pool by the E bldg. they’re kids. They’re allowed to have fun and enjoy the pool - it’s the best part of a hotel stay for the kids. But leave your adult guests who want a kid free time to have an area where they can be adults without the shrieking and splashing. Four seasons does this. Why is this also such a foreign concept for the Ritz?    3 stars instead of 1 because their pool staff and housekeeping staff is awesome, and their overall customer service is typical of a Ritz Carlton. Beds are also very comfortable.    Unfortunately (or fortunately) we will not be staying here in the future or recommending it to our friends unless it’s their first time in Oahu and they’re here to play tourists, not relax.",Feb 2019,February 2019,Traveled as a couple,,"San Francisco, California"
652889889,30,Rollercoaster ride of a stay,"I really debated with myself what rating to give this property. I finally decided that it would be unfair to other properties to give this one a higher rating, because, even with all the positives, the things the Ritz-Carlton failed at are unfortunately significant and, given the pattern shown, unlikely to be changed.    Let's start from the beginning...    The location is definitely convenient -- especially given the demographic they are going for. Having said that Honolulu is not exactly a big City, and there is one massive downside to the location, which is the constant noise. Construction noise, traffic, noise, etc. Not only the noise cannot be avoided when at the pool or restaurants, the worst part -- and where my first gripe begins -- I can't be avoided in the rooms either; for some inexplicable reason even the newest tower lacks properly soundproofed windows, which is inexcusable for a high end luxury property that was just built.    The result is that even in spite of very comfortable beds, and very modern, silent, central A/C, the street noise just permeates through the rooms -- yes, even in the 25th floor. Even at night. I can't really fathom what they were thinking when they chose to not use Soundproof Sliding Glass Doors.    ... and for me not getting a good night's sleep due to the noise is really an essential component of my rating. So even though the room we got was otherwise brand new, impeccable, beautifully designed and furnished, with high end appliances and everything, the lack of Soundproof Sliding Glass Doors is just to big of a sin to ignore.    ... but unfortunately that's not all.    As I've written in some of my other reviews, one really pics a Ritz-Carlton (or a Fairmont, or a Four Seasons) for the legendary service.    In this trip in particular -- because it was for Valentine's Day -- my expectations for service where extremely high. I contacted the Concierge team way before my stay, and set up several things through them.    I have to say the Concierge team was a delight to work with before my stay -- they were responsive, polite, helpful, professional and extremely resourceful. They are, in fact, why I struggle with giving the RCWB an average rating; if I could rate them separately I would give them 5 starts.    Unfortunately once I arrived the problems started pretty early and quickly.    My first issue was with my bags; even though I was very clear with the front desk staff that I needed my bags brought up quickly and I had one hour before my dinner reservation and needed to shower and change clothes, there were no signs of the bags after me waiting for them for 30 minutes. I called the front desk at that point -- and 20 minutes after that (total wait time: 50 minutes) my bags finally showed up, giving me 10 minutes to shower, change and get to my restaurant. That was not a good way to start the stay.    Now, they did realize they had messed up, and later that night I did get a very nice apology note accompanied by what I swear were the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever had in my life. I almost called downstairs and asked them where they got those cookies -- which actually I almost think were home baked -- so I can buy them every time I come back to Honolulu.    The apology was so good and the cookies so awesome I was willing to forgive them at that point.    But then a pattern began...    The next day -- Valentine's Day -- the flowers I had ordered showed up over an hour late (and timing was important, since we needed to leave). Didn't get an explanation or apology for that. Although I'm willing to accept that it may have been a problem with the vendor, the fact that was zero communication during or after the mishap is highly problematic; I am aware the Concierge was likely not around that morning but in that case they should have made sure somebody on the staff was aware of the request, handling it and communicating with me as we (patiently) waited.    Then later that afternoon they showed up to do special turn down service 2 hours before the time I specifically requested months in advance (because, again, timing was important...). They did make up for that -- after I repeated my request for a specific time for the turndown, the service team did come back at the right time and did a spectacular job with the ""extras"" I had requested for turndown (basically a few special Valentine's Day requests); however the fact that I had to be interrupted to explain to them again a request I had clearly made (and got confirmation of, in writing) is off-putting.    I'm still willing to accept that for two of the mistakes they did make up for it, but for the flowers one the lack of any explanation or apology and the fact that it had such a negative impact on our plans really is the reason I took out another star.    Given how many open positions they are advertising, I suspect they may be a little understaffed.    Also, although I was really impressed with the food at the The Market restaurant (where we had breakfast), the second day was a complete letdown service wise.    Ultimately: although this is still likely the poshest property in Waikiki, there's a tremendous amount of work they need to do to deserve 5 stars from me: one, they need to get those Soundproof Sliding Glass Doors, and two they need to increase the timeliness and consistency of the service, definitely by increasing staff, and potentially working on their communication.    Finally: it's valet only parking but I have to say the valet team was the one team that never, even let me down the whole stay, they are absolutely outstanding.",Feb 2019,February 2019,Traveled as a couple,,"San Francisco, California"

Debbie (Asian girl) answered a lot of our questions the time we checked in. She remembered my wife's birthday and delivered a birthday card, white wine and a piece of cake for celebration. Thanks Debbie!! Others including housekeeper, Valet parking staffs are so nice and efficient.    We definitely will return back next year for longer vacation. If you really want to find some 'faults' in this hotel, what I could say is tap water is 'not drinkable'. I use water meter to measure ppm, it is about 300 - not recommend to drink. So we bought our 4L bottle water every day. But don't worry, an ABC store (convenient store) and Long drugs convenient store are just within 3 minutes of walk.    To conclude, this hotel is the best we stayed so far! We definitely will return back. Hopefully, they could keep this hotel running as nice as it is right now.",Feb 2019,February 2019,Traveled as a couple,Best location! Best utensils! Best staff!,Williams Lake
651352738,50,Unparalleled Luxury in Waikiki,"Most ""timeshare""/residence properties i have stayed at offer the benefits of a larger residence, but lack the amenities and service of a resort. This property did a great job of offering both. Also, the truly luxury options are a little limited in Waikiki (and the few properties that qualify are dated) so this is a great addition to the options here!    Rooms: Booked a studio, was offered an upgrade to a 1BR 2 BA suite for $100 a night which i thought was reasonable. Room was bright and spacious.One of the most comfortable beds i have ever experienced in a hotel.Kitchen was well appointed. Great view towards the Hilton Hawaiian Village which meant an unparalleled view of the fireworks but exposure towards the beach meant intense sunlight in the room in the afternoon. Massive Lanai accomodated both a table for 4 as well as lounge chairs.    Location: Good location in a quieter part of Waikiki, situated a few blocks from Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center.    Amentities: Outstanding fitness center. Beautiful infinity pool with cabanas, 2 full bars.    Service: everyone was outstanding - friendly and efficient without being pretentious.    Other: We stayed in the newer, Diamond Head tower, which was nice, but was a little bit of an out of the way trek to get to.",Feb 2019,February 2019,Traveled with family,,"San Francisco, California"

They made us feel at home. Loke, valet services, always had a smile upon entering the hotel premises. She always checked to make sure the kids either had a little toy in hand, beach bag, or water. Stephanie , in concierge, also was super helpful with all of our questions and needs. Rental car arrangements, driving tour, and Tanaka teppanyaki suggestion was great for the kids for dinner.

646702121,50,Absolutely great!,"I stayed 5 days for business trip with my boss and his wife.  It was a first time to stay the hotel Ritz-Carlton.  As I thought, I was able to have a fulfilling stay with such a wonderful hospitality.  Every staff are very very kind, especially bell staff dude is really gentle.  He always cared and spoke to me.  Room facilities are completely fulfill. There are Washing machine, cloth dryer, dishes, oven, every stuff that need to live. Room keeper clean up perfect every day, and they left little happy surprise.  Gym open 24/7, pool is nice.  View from window are very very great and absolutely hawaii!!  Beautiful sunset at twilight and rainbow after rain.  I want go back again and next time I decide I will go private.  Thank you for every thing they gave me during my stay.  P.S. Japanese staff can't speak English well.  They have to make some deal of effort.    とても素晴らしい滞在でした。リッツに泊るのは初めてでしたが、また是非泊りたいと思う体験ができました。  スタッフの皆さんも気遣い、心遣いがいたるところにあり、やさしく、親切に対応いただきました。  心より感謝いたしております。",Jan 2019,December 2018,Traveled on business,,"Tokyo, Japan"
646639604,50,Perfect location and terrific service and view,"Love Ritz-Carlton properties so was excited to book the residences in Waikiki for our trip. The whole experience was luxurious and the service amazing. Our room faced the ocean and our balcony was awesome to sit on and just soak in the evenings. They did the balconies correctly by making them all glass so no bars to spoil the view. We were in the D tower (which stands for the Diamond Head view) and so had to go up an elevator and then walk a bit and up another elevator. The elevators at this place are very new and you actually have to use your room key and punch in where you are headed before you enter as there are NO buttons inside the elevator. The concierge was conveniently located on our way to our room if we had any needs at all. The outside bar area was really fun and the bartender extremely friendly, nice place for a happy hour. I just felt like they totally took care of us the whole time we were there and our room was quiet and very comfortable. Would definitely recommend it again.

Great concierge service, valet parking is efficient (35 usd per day), rooms are modern, contemporary decor, the washing machine and dryer was so useful, top location.  If I had to find a negative, it would be for the swimming pools which are pretty small even though there are 2 of them, with not enough long chairs during peak hours. Perhaps, Ritz shouldn't keep those spaces for private cabanas rental...

Housekeeping was discreet and came twice a day. The balcony view was great, and offered afternoon sun. The pool service was very nice, but given the number of units it can get busy. Keep in mind that you are in Waikiki, so you have the benefit of being close to the strip of restaurants and stores - downside is you can hear it at night and early in the morning if you keep the balcony door open.

642270114,30,3 star stay with 5 star aspirations,"Pros:    1. New property: We stayed in the Diamond Head Tower which was very clean.    2. Nice Gym: Lots of cardio machines and weights. They supply water bottles, towels, and earbuds.    3. Great Location: Close to luxury row, beach, and multiple dining options    4. Happy hour at hotel from 3-6pm: Delicious food options and generous drinks    5. Every day at 3pm, they hand out ice cream by the pool: flavors include coconut, taro, and pineapple mochi    6. Beautiful view of the sunset every night    Cons:    1. On the day of our departure, they called us at 11:59pm to ""remind"" us it was check out    - As we were zipping up our luggage, they called us to let us know we needed to leave because a guest of the owner is staying in our room after us and they need to get it ready.    2. Understaffed in some areas, overstaffed in others.    There are 2-4 people in the less utilized concierge area, but only 1 staff member in the very busy pool area.    3. All 3 pools are crowded    Although they say that one ""serenity pool"" is for adults only no one actually monitors this. There are children splashing, playing marco polo, and screaming in every pool.    4. Pool side service    Arrived at our Diamond Head Tower pool at 11am and planned to hang out for the day. We ordered food from Shelby. She brought the wrong order, which is fine because it was busy. Immediately upon delivering our correct order, she brought us our check. We never asked for the check and planned to order more food through out the day. We later overheard that she was planning on leaving work early and wanted to close our tab but then she was asked to stay on by the manager. We didn't feel comfortable opening another tab with her so we just walked over to the Horizons Grill each time we wanted to order something.    5. They do tours for certain airline companies, who take pictures of you when you are working our or poolside without asking    6. Strange room design    - Very little closet space, but a huge washer and dryer unit    - Full kitchen which takes up a lot of room in such a small space.    - Bathroom design is not co-inhabitant friendly. It is an open plan with wooden shades that can close off the bathroom from the room itself. There is 1 light switch that lights up the entire bathroom. The toilet is in a separate enclave that has no light, so it is dark in there.    7. The stones on the pools kept coming loose.    During our stay, EMT services was called on 2 separate occasions because patrons would cut themselves on parts of the pool that would fall off.    In sum, the Ritz Carlton Residences is trying very hard to provide a 5 star service. Though its amenities are in line with the Ritz brand, the service is lacking. Its seems like they may have hired some high school students to wait on their guests. At 5 star prices, we expect a bit more hospitality.",Dec 2018,December 2018,Traveled as a couple,,"San Francisco, California"
642141528,50,Best Hotel Experience,"It's been super busy for me for the last three months, I finally find some time to finish this review for The Ritz-Carlton Residences, Waikiki Beach.  I have never written a review for a hotel, even though I've stayed in hundreds of different ones. But this one is special, I could not stop thinking about sharing the fabulous experience I got with every one of you even during my busiest time, as it's simply AMAZING.    My wife and I stayed in this hotel at the end of September for our wedding on Oahu island. Before going there, I spent quite some time looking for where to stay and this hotel stood out due to the great reviews on TripAdvisor, especially for its outstanding service. So I booked a room and wrote an email to tell them the purpose of my stay. They responded promptly and generously offered me a room upgrade. They also thoroughly answered my questions about their SPA service as I wanted my wife to be fully relaxed and refreshed on the wedding day.  The communication made me feel very well treated.   The check-in was smooth, we were warmly welcomed by the front desk and were told our room was upgraded to a suite. We were astonished when we entered the room. The room was well prepared for us! They offered a bottle of sparkling wine with a congrats card and flower peddles around the bucket.  They decorated the room with tons of flowers and candles as you can see from the picture. What you can’t see is there actually was a path made with peddles that lead to the bed from the living room. Everything was so beautiful and romantic. We were so touched when we saw all of those as we could tell they care about us and they wanted us to have the best memories during the stay. When we were still immersed in the feeling of being spoiled, we found a lovely chocolate cake hidden in the fridge which surprised us even more!     The room itself is gorgeous as others already stated. We especially liked the patio which is huge and facing the ocean with splendid view, as you can tell from my photo.     My wife went to the SPA shortly after we checked in. Her words describe the experience is “Absolutely Perfect”. She told me that besides the treatment I ordered, they even offered her a treatment specifically for Bride free of charge!     The bed was extremely comfortable, we both had a great night and rested very well for our big day.     All the staff we met were super friendly and well trained. There is one man we’d like to thank particularly, his name is Josh. I was having difficulties wearing a bow tie, the stylist didn’t know how to wear a self-tie bow tie either, so I called the front desk asking for help. They checked their staff, unfortunately, no one knew how to do it. The photographers were about to arrive, but I didn’t have the bow tie ready, I was in a total panic. Then Josh came. He started learning how to wear a bow tie via YouTube, practiced on himself and worked together with me and successfully put a cute little bow tie on my neck. He saved my day. After everything was done, I was trying to find some cash to tip him, but he told me “It’s OK Xiao, my wife is also from China, we’re family, please keep the money for your wedding.” At that moment, he was like an angle to us.     I will save the words on other nice things that other people have already mentioned in their reviews. All in all, I will recommend the Ritz-Carlton Residences, Waikiki Beach to everyone for its incredibly awesome service.  As for us, we will come back every couple of years as it's no longer a great hotel, it’s part of the best memories of our life.",Dec 2018,September 2018,Traveled as a couple,,
642060998,50,Excellent accommodations in middle of Waikiki,"Due to a strike at the Royal Hawaiian, we changed our reservation to the brandnew Ritz Carlton, and were happy we did.  The location is close to but not on the beach. Beautiful rooftop pool makes up for that. All the excitement of Waikiki is within easy walking distance, whereas the hotel itself is an oasis of peace and quiet.  The suite was beautiful, very clean with comfortable bed, kitchenette, and all the comforts one expects from this brand.  The employees are well-trained, friendly, and seem to take a personal interest in the well-being of their guests.  The place may feel a bit 'sterile' compared to the traditional Hawaiian hotels, which may be due to its new condition. For us not a big deal considering the excellent quality of the suite. I assume that, with time, the hotel will add a finishing touch with a few Hawaiian features here and there.  The pool restaurant is nice and has the usual cocktails and comfort foods.  The second restaurant looks very modern, and did not appeal to us. Plenty of restaurants close by though.  We would definitely return.",Dec 2018,November 2018,Traveled as a couple,,Florida

The beach is a 5-10 minute walk, and the luxury row shops (if you’re into high-end shopping) are 25 steps outside the front door.

Their attention to detail in mundane daily routines like room cleaning and turn-down is just amazing.

639652774,50,An excellent new first class hotel in Honolulu,"Honolulu has so many old beat up hotel properties and seeing a newly built first class property with the quality of the Ritz was quite a treat to stay there using our Marriott points before the amount skyrockets.  We opted for the studio for the two of us and it was more room than we needed. Extremely well planned out and thoughtful considerations for space. We used the kitchen to make minor meals, the refrigerator worked well keeping things cold and we loved the washer and dryer setup. Large bathrooms with a spacious double sink and my favorite Toto toilets which as doubled as a bidet.  Property is quiet and soundproofing very good by Honolulu standards. Coffee pods by nepresso provided.  Staff were always seeking to help in any way and whatever you asked they wanted to help.  The property is two blocks from the beach but there is very little sand left along this part of Waikiki so we hung out at one of two pools or went off to other beaches out of the tourist strip for peace and stunning views.  My only complaint is that their restaurants were disappointing overall and expensive. So after a semi warm breakfast and disappointing pool side snack we just went off property to eat.  Finally, I did not understand why such a premium property did not offer beach chairs like the other hotels do in that star category. Very odd.

637282865,50,Amazing!,"Excellent in every way and exceeded my expectations! From the moment we entered the property until we left, we were given the royal treatment! Smiling, helpful, very professional staff added great value to our experience! As soon as we arrived, the attendants approached us with a smile and offered to take our bags and to escort us up in the elevator to the lobby. I don't think we could have gotten up to the lobby without assistance, though, cause I believe they had to use their keycard in the elevator. We were then greeted by a lovely lady, Moko, who was very welcoming and put lovely lei's on our necks! What a pleasant surprise and very nice touch as she also handed us cool, wet towels and a welcome drink! What a way to greet guests! They nailed it from the beginning to end! Then, Ally, the front desk agent, who checked us in was very kind and had a great demeanor! We were very thankful for the upgrade and early check in! We also were given great assistance at the front desk by Josh and other staff including the operator, during our stay! We did have to change rooms a couple times due to the refrig not working in our first room; the second room didn't have a true king bed, so we were kindly moved to a third room which had a true king bed (instead of two twins pushed together); each room was excellent although I did notice a couple slight differences...one room didn't have a dishwasher... and the sheets in the higher floor room were even nicer, if that is possible! Since the rooms are actually residences with their own respective owners, maybe the owners of each room set the rooms up with varying options. I must mention that the toliets in the rooms were simply amazing! High tech at it's best (heated/nightlight...!). It's nice that the room refrig is stocked with as much water as you like, just advise the concierge or housekeeping. The rooms are fully equipped and is more like a lovely condo! Our room was in the brand new (2 week old) Diamond Head Tower and it was amazing! We were escorted from the main lobby to the pool area to await our room. The infinity pool is simply amazing and everything anyone could wish for in a pool with a great view of the city! Service was great and I do believe the young lady who helped us most was named Ocean. Everyone who assisted us were very kind and thoughtful. One of the corner cabanas which we utilized for the day was a very nice treat which added to the amazing ambiance! The cabana had a mounted tv, stocked mini frig, and very comfy lounge chairs. The cabana structure was cherry wood, I think, and it was very upscale looking! Apples, towels and infused water was available as a courtesy in the pool areas, which was a nice treat, too!  The gym is very nice (new equipment) and I especially liked the punching bag, but, would have liked if they provided boxing gloves. I had to wrap towels around my hands to get in a few hits on the bag! Water, wet/cool towels, earplugs, and apples are provided which is very nice, too!  We ordered lunch while at the pool and it was very good! The price was a bit high as to be expected...they use Waygu beef for the burgers! The bread was good, and the fries were good, too! We also went out on the town for burgers and they didn't even compare to the burgers at The Ritz!  We used points for the first two nights and paid over $600 for the third night! It was very expensive to us, given that it was way outta our normal budget, but, I must admit, it was well worth the memories being made here! I am on the lookout for any future deals at this property or off peak prices, because this is one of my absolute favorites!  I am a bit disappointed that we didn't take advantage of the turndown service. It would be nice if this was shared at checkin. I saw pictures of another person's turndown and their chocolates, and I was sad that I missed this little treat and getting my room refreshed. My fault for not asking for it and for having the do not disturb on my door, though. Next time, though, I'm gonna take advantage of every little treat offered, ijs, lol!  Oh, we stayed a couple nights down the street at the Marriott hotel which is right across the street from the beach; we like staying there which is more in our price range! The Ritz is about a 10-15 walk to the beach but it is near all the high-end shopping spots right near Luxury Row; it's also near a lot of restaurants! The Marriott is an old property and the rooms could use updating but it is very clean and the lobby is a very nice relaxing spot as are the other amenities on the property!  Lastly, I must mention that there was a strike going on from Marriott workers, and, had we known beforehand, we certainly would not have stayed here until after the strike, out of respect. I hope the Marriott brand hotels and the workers (the Union) can come to a fair/good solution for all involved...  I love the Marriott brand of hotels!",Dec 2018,November 2018,,,"Seattle, Washington"
636350222,40,Great!,"I booked this hotel as a package with my airline. Husband and I stayed for 8 days. Upon arrival we were greeted by guest relations who walked us to the front desk and gave us a refreshing welcome drink which was delicious. The reservations staff checked us in and walked us to the new tower where we were staying. We booked a one bedroom deluxe suite and the view was just amazing. It has an open concept living room kitchen, a bedroom with bathroom and to my surprise there was a second bathroom which I ended up using despite having plenty of space in the main bathroom. Bathroom has a powerful hairdryer - bring your own flat iron, ladies! The place is pretty much an apartment which was awesome! Kitchen is all set up with dishes and great coffee. Bed was comfortable. Noise level at night - you can hear some of the street noise ( wear ear plugs if sensitive to noise or use a nature noise app - that is what I did and slept well) - we went to bed early by 10pm - noise was not every night.    Service - Staff provided great customer service. Guest relations took care of all my reqests prior to arrival.    Location - I loved the location. Very lively but upscale. Beach is walking distance. There are high end stores and local shops around. Lots of restaurants. Dean Deluca downstairs was great! The view was lovely and best of all you can watch the Friday fireworks from room while drinking some wine!    Spa- I used the spa. It was nice and the staff was great. The spa feels like a day spa due to décor being bright instead of dark. The locker room is small but it has everything you need and the wet and dry saunas are there. They added a serenity room to wait which was nice but needs a little more décor on some of the walls to make it more zen. The spa carries great products. Massage therapist listen to all my requests - she was lovely!    Pool - Nice but the downside is that the pool has children all over. I didn't use the pool.    Room Service - Ordered breakfast twice - Food was great and service was great. However, some inconsistence with service - One staff did observe do not disturb sign and called instead of knocking. Second time around, staff knocked despite sign. Also, food was missing an item - staff did apologize and returned with item - no big deal just inconsistant service.    Pool Café - Good drinks, however inconsistent service. One bartender gave same drink in a small glass another bartender made it in a tall glass and made it fancier (properly). Food service seemed slow despite no one else seated at café. Food was ok not great/wow - had issue with the temperature of the sashimi which was lukewarm room temperature when it should be cold, the other items (poke and toke) were the right temperature. Needless to say, I didn't eat the sashimi. I think they need to up their game with the pool menu and train the young staff to apply all the upscale service one expects despite being by the pool. My waitress at the café chatting with the bartender and took a while to check on me. I eventually informed front desk about food issue - was informed that they would inform dining manager but I don't know if that took place since we didn't hear from anyone.

Every single person at the Ritz does an incredible job of making you feel welcomed and actively work to make sure you're happy. Whether it was asking us if we needed towels for a beach trip while delivering our car at valet (in a nice bag too), or the suggestions on where to go for beaches, food or entertainment, they were uniformly awesome.    Second, the room. Our bed was incredibly soft and comfortable with clean and perfectly white bedding. Our balcony was spacious and had a great view of the ocean. The TV has Netflix built in. An ensuite washer/dryer. And the bathroom? Oh my the bathroom. Marble throughout, wonderful luxury toiletries, and an awesome shower and standup tub combination. All perfectly clean and sparkling.

I had a deluxe studio with 2 very large screen TVs, fully equipped kitchenette equipped with a 2 burner electric stove and top of the line appliances. The heated toilet seat that washes and dries you is the most unique ever. We loved it. We were there during the hurricane so the bottled waters they provide were limited for a little while. The staff did their best to make sure we had some water on hand even during the times when the port and airport was closed and supplies were at a premium. We always felt welcomed. Service was great. There was only one day out of the six days we were there that our room was serviced late and that was also because of limited staff during the expected hurricane.

615666734,50,One Bedroom Suite / 7 night stay,"Hotel location - Positioned at the ""luxury"" end of the shopping district on Kalakaua Ave, the hotel is in a nice quiet spot even though you are only a few minutes walk to the centre of all the action. Around the corner you can catch the pink trolley which takes you to Ala Moana (the largest shopping mall in Hawaii), and a short walk to the T Galleria you can catch other tourist trolleys to Diamond Head, Pearl Harbor etc.    One Bedroom Suite - we had a lovely, spacious room (see photos attached) on the 28th floor. We had great view of the ocean all the way from Waikiki's Pink Palace to glimpses of the boat harbour at Ala Moana.    The three VERY MINOR things that weren't great about our room was that there was very little pressure in the shower (probably the weakest shower pressure I've ever encountered in a hotel); that there were no hooks to hang our bath towels to dry (I had to drape mine on the toilet door handle, husband would hang his on a coat hanger); and that the pillows were too soft for my liking, and even the ""firm"" ones housekeeping brought up were also very soft. Literally, that was it.    Service - exceptional. I was contacted before our stay about any arrangements that could be made prior to our arrival. Everyone we encountered from checking in/ out at the lobby, the concierge, room service etc were fantastic - every staff member went out of their way to make you feel welcome and that any request was no trouble at all.    Restaurant & cafe - We loved going to Dean & DeLuca in the afternoons for coffee and snacks. They have a great selection of savoury food, cakes and pastries. We ate at the main restaurant twice. The menu is not huge but what we ate was nice and again the service was exceptional (although on both nights the restaurant was awfully quiet, not sure if that is because guests generally choose to eat out or because we went at a quiet time of year...)    Hotel amenities - we didn't use the spa, pool or valet so I cannot comment on those but we regularly used the gym, which had a great selection of machines and equipment.    I haven't stayed in any other hotels in Hawaii so I cannot compare, but this is a great hotel with exceptional service and we would definitely recommend it to others.",Sep 2018,September 2018,Traveled as a couple,,"Sydney, NSW"
614487152,50,Everything You Expect From A Ritz-Carlton,"My husband and I spent 4 nights at this resort and thoroughly enjoyed our stay! I liked that it is located off a quiet side street, making it easier to get in/out (via car) compared to hotels located in the center of the very busy and crowded Kalakaua Ave. Despite being in a quieter section, it was still within very short walking distance to plenty of excellent shops and restaurants. Though the hotel was not directly on the beach, it was maybe 5 minutes walk to the sand (just go straight down Saratoga Rd).    Prior to arrival, I corresponded with Sandy Suzuki from Guest Relations. I initially e-mailed her about reserving dinner at Sushi Sho (highly recommend reserving!!), but soon found her to very helpful in other things, including early check-in, restaurant and activity recommendations and even pre-stocking the refrigerator. She was very responsive and helpful in planning our stay. She was just as nice and helpful when we finally met her in person!    Upon arrival, our entire stay lived up to the Ritz-Carlton name. Service from all the staff we encountered were excellent. Everyone was professional, courteous and responsive to any request or question we had.    We reserved a one bedroom, which was pristine, beautifully decorated and very comfortable. I learned from prior experience in traveling to Hawaii that a washer/dryer and kitchen are 'must haves' in the room. The kitchen was stocked with a sufficient enough of pots/pans, dishes, utensils, etc. for extended stays. The Nespresso machine and the small water bottles (replenished daily) were added bonuses. The only thing missing I would have liked was a bread knife. After coming back from the sandy beach, hiking muddy trails or just being outside in the tropical sun, it was nice to have fresh, clean clothes throughout our stay!    Note: Laundry detergent and dish washing soap & sponges are provided (and replenished, as necessary).    If you rent a car, there is a $35/day valet parking fee (no self parking allowed). The valet attendants were super prompt at having your car ready if you call right before leaving the room. At the valet station, they also hand out tote bags with two towels and water bottles or umbrellas, if needed.    We had dinner at Sushi Sho and highly recommend reserving well in advanced if you want an amazing sushi experience. The Dean & DeLuca is small, but sufficient if you want espresso drinks, light meals/snacks or pastries. We had lunch at their main restaurant once. The food is good enough if you want something to eat while lounging at the pool or too lazy to walk outside. However, there are way more wonderful restaurants to eat within a few minutes walk away which I would encourage to try instead.    With top notch service, accessible location to many amazing restaurants and an in-room kitchen and washer/dryer, I would definitely recommend staying here.

From the second we arrived, I felt as if I were walking on cotton. The service here is absolutely fantastic. We got our room at 10 am, the second one was ready an hour later. My inquiry to the bell boy if he knew about male therapists at their own spa earned me a phone call from their concierge who had made inquiries at other nearby hotels (since the answer was no!) This is anticipating your customer's needs.    The rooms are super spacious, clean and airy and the beds are a dream to sleep in. My son and I spent some time by the pool, where we were welcomed by a super friendly attendant who provided us with a cabana to stay out of the sunshine.    The concierge not only organized my massage, they also got us a great table at a local restaurant for dinner with stunning food. Great work!    Best of all? When we had to leave at 4:45 in the morning to get to our 7 am flight, one of our suitcases broke, ten minutes before our car was due to leave. Panic! Not at the front desk. Within a minute, an engineer was in our room trying to repair the suitcase and when that didn't work, they organized a new suitcase from their lost & found. We quickly repacked and were on our way in time.    My only way to summarize my experience is ""wow!""

As it turns out, the advertised price on their own site was an error and they would not honour it. I know this happens to airlines regularly and they honour the incorrect price. I didn't expect a ""five-star"" chain like the Ritz to not honour a rate. I also spoke with the GM and he confirmed that they could not honour the incorrect rate. Alternative accommodations were arranged but bottom line, they advertised a rate on their own website and then reneged on the rate. This is poor customer service and poor business practice.

605443890,50,The Ritz Carlton Residences Waikiki - Like a Book You Can't Put Down,"Let's back up to our pre-arrival treatment. We had booked the The RItz-Carlton Residences Waikiki and initially there was some confusion around the rate. When this was discovered, the Manager of the Residences, Douglas Chang, reached out to us to apologize and explain what happened. He wanted to ensure we had a great experience and said to let him know if we had any questions prior to our arrival.    Well, a few weeks before we were set to arrive, we received email(s) from the hotel asking what they could do to make our stay more comfortable and if we had any special / specific requests. Already we knew this stay would be special.    When we arrived at the Residences, the first thing we notice is the entrance/motor court. It is like arriving at Fantasy Island. We were greeted by Maria who promptly provided us with traditional Hawaiian necklaces - not your typical flower lei but a necklace crafted from a type of shell or nut (Macadamia I believe) - a definite keepsake. Everyone at the desk greeted us with a smile and a hello. Ahhhhhh our vacation had officially begun.    We were then escorted up to the Check in desk where again we were greeted with very friendly smiles and a pleasant frozen drink. Maria bid us a pleasant evening and we were now ready to check in. I have to say we were a bit distracted as the lobby was very elegant and peaceful. With the wide open floor plan you felt like you were standing in an infinity edge lobby (if that is such a thing). Off the lobby were the pool and the restaurant. I appreciated that it is an intimate property where you do not need to walk too far if you want to have a nice meal and/or go for a swim. The restaurant by the way does provide room service.    We checked in and unfortunately my husband has very sensitive allergies and he said he smelled smoke in the room (cigarette/cigar). While it was late at night and we were tired from working all day and then flying from San Francisco, he wouldn't be able to sleep with the smell. He called down to the desk and explained.    Without another word, they had another suite prepped and cleaned and sent a bellman up to switch our keys and ensure we had what we needed. Understand here that it was late at night and while many other hotels would have let us know that there was no staff available to clean the new room, this issue was never even raised - they took care of us.    Once we arrived to our room, we received a knock on the door and low and behold we were brought snacks for the evening to thank us for staying.    Now the room was heaven. We had a beautiful suite including a large luxurious bathroom with double sinks (yay - no waiting for each other to get ready). Oh and did I mention a built in refrigerator, cooktop, washer and dryer and more.    We quickly settled in and had a wonderful and very restful sleep. The room was quiet, the bed was so comfortable and it was the perfect way to start our week long stay.    Each and every morning we were greeted by the Concierge(s), Laurie and Jamie, always with a smile. I must say that every employee of the Residences, would stop to say hello, smile and make us feel as though we were the only guests there.    As the week went on, we utilized many of the services offered including complimentary shoe shine, gym, pool, and one day we had our family come over (as they were staying at a hotel nearby) to spend time at the pool.    Jamie at the concierge desk arranged a cabana rental for us. The best part about the pool area is that there are only a handful of cabanas and the pool is perfect for laps and is framed on either end by hot tubs. If you do not want to rent a cabana, there are of course chairs around and we never had a problem securing a spot. The Pool staff were wonderful, attentive and so friendly. The minute you walk down the steps to the pool, they are there to help in anyway they can.    Note, to our surprise, there was a safe in the cabana and a small refrigerator stocked with some nice refreshments. In our cabana, the safe had been left locked by the previous guest. I mentioned it to Momo and within seconds, a maintenance person was there to help.    The cabanas have a drape to close for some privacy and to filter the sun. This was great as our niece wanted to take a nap and she had no problem falling asleep. The pool side service was great - the food was delicious and we never waited very long for anything.    Each day, coming and going, we were greeted by the staff who would take a minute and ask how our day was. It was nice to feel so special and welcome. A couple of times we were in our room when housekeeping arrived and they asked if it was okay to clean and while they were cleaning, they engaged in a conversation asking how we were enjoying our stay. Again, perhaps it is the Island way, for everyone to be friendly, but whatever the reason, each staff member went above and beyond.    The Residences are located in an awesome spot. Walking distance to the beach, and the high end shops around, made it even more magical. Right downstairs is a Dean and DeLuca which we really love and I must say, having been to others, we were shocked at the prices - not how high but how reasonable. Great assortment of items - but I will save that for another write up.    As we were winding down our vacation, on the last day at check out, I happened to ask the Concierge if they had an extra note pad as I love the note pads - a light blue and just the right size. Laurie went and found a couple and gave them to me which made me happy to have a nice memory.    Well, a few days after we arrived home, a FedEx showed up. Inside were a bunch of Ritz-Carlton note pads with the sweetest note from Laurie and Jamie.    This was by far one of the most amazing stays we have experienced of any of the hotels we have been, around the World.

The hotel is only a couple of years old, and from what we’ve seen is by far the most modern. The suite is large enough for 2 adults and 2 kids - both 11 years old. The couch is turned into a bed nightly and put away every morning by staff. All the staff from the pool guys, to the valets, waiting staff and concierge are so helpful and kind, it has really made our stay. Nothing is too much trouble. There is a great restaurant in the hotel serving, breakfast, lunch and dinner and the food is great - something I can’t honestly say for a lot of local restaurants. There is also a great little cafe on the ground floor with the best coffee. Oahu itself can be a little dated (other than the fabulous shopping -Luxury Row is literally at the great floor of the hotel), so the Ritz is a welcome addition. Of course perfection is difficult and subjective so...the air con is great in the living room but with no separate control, it’s only around 50% effective in the bedroom. It made sleeping a little uncomfortable for us in the main bedroom as we had to turn off the a/c as it was too cold left on for the kids. The pool is a little small for a family hotel but we never had an issue getting beds or a cabana.

The personalized service at this property puts it in a league of it’s own. It is immaculately clean with every amenity imaginable. The unobstructed views of the ocean & mountains will literally take your breath away. There is no better location for a great view of Diamond Head and Waikiki beach. The property is not right on beach but is a short five minute walk away. They provide beach bags with towels and bottled water every time you leave the property.

During my many stays at Ritz Carlton properties over the years, I have had many memorable experiences and had many staff members go above and beyond to provide great service. However, it was taken to a new level at this property. Our departing flight was cancelled after nearly three hours of sitting on the plane. I immediately called the property to see if we could come back to our original residence. On the phone was the nicest and most helpful staff member I have ever encountered at a Ritz Carlton. His name was Gavin. He not only told us to come back he came and picked up my family of five and nine pieces of baggage in his personal mini van. This was at the end of his shift at 1030 PM. He arrived at the Honolulu Airport just as we walked out with our bags and greeted us with a smile on his face and helped to load all the bags. He took us to the property and personally took the bags to our room and even had our coffee preference in the room for the next morning. He had the room cleaned and all of our preferences in place upon arrival. This is the type of service you can expect from the Ritz Carlton Waikiki Residences and the accommodations are amazing. You will not be disappointed.    A special thanks to Gavin, Cori and Doug for all their hard work and for setting a new standard of service for all future travel.",Jun 2018,May 2018,Traveled with family,,South Carolina

The bathroom is luxurious, with double sinks, a shower integrated within the tub area, and a separate little room for the toilet. The toilet had a heated seat and a washlet.    A negative for us: the location is extremely noisy. During the week, construction of the tower next door begins early in the morning and lasts all day. (We got a reprieve on Saturday and Sunday.) The location is smack dab in the city, so traffic noise adds to the din. Fortunately, the building has good sound-proofing, so when the sliders to the balcony were closed, noise wasn't a problem inside the suite.    Every staff member is cheerful, greeting guests with a sunny “aloha!”    We enjoyed several breakfasts and lunches at BLT on the lobby (8th floor) level. The menu is fairly limited, but food quality is very good.

572510090,50,Delightful for family,"OK, this is my second attempt to review this wonderful hotel. My earlier review was rejected because it had comparisons to another luxury hotel located between this hotel and the beach which shall remain unnamed, however, it had been a family favorite of ours for the last three years for President's week in Feb. With my mother in law and two teenage daughters we rented the two bedroom unit. It was nicely laid out and made efficient use of the space. The kitchen, although compact, had really nice high end appliances. The unit also had an ocean view. The Westin Heavenly beds with the down topper is super comfortable, my daughter who slept on the sofa bed also had one that made it more comfortable so she didn't feel the springs. The property is quiet and luxurious and service level is very good. We had a car and it was always ready and waiting for us when we called for it. The elevators are very fast, the security is good and the algorithms help allocate the fastest one for you. There is very little waiting. The gym is very nice, roomy, well equipped and has nice bright windows. It's a little bit of a walk to Waikiki beach but we used the car to go to local beaches which had good parking. I called a rental company earlier and had umbrellas and chairs delivered to the hotel that we kept in the car for the beach time. The hotel is well situated for the shopping, dining and entertaining evenings on Kalakaua Avenue. It's really become a world class shopping and dining destination over the last five years. If you haven't been there recently you will be pleasantly surprised. It's my family's favorite place to come. My teenage daughter told me she likes it more than Christmas. I am sure we shall return next year.,",Apr 2018,February 2018,,,"Bellevue, Washington"
571786043,50,"Amazing resort, good location and good service (with a twist)","I stayed at the Grand Suite Ocean View on the 25th floor and I was stunned by the beauty of the room and quality of everything (bed, towels, etc). The view was amazing and I could also watch Netflix/Youtube on the television. We also had a mini kitchen and a washing machine. I definitely recommend staying at this room with your loved one and you will feel so romantic!    The ONLY downfall is that the housekeepers kept coming into our room! Instead of ringing the doorbell and then you go out and opening it - they just barge right in! Even after we've already had housekeeping in the morning, they will come in the afternoon (one even came at 9am in the morning wtf). It happened literally everyday during our stay and that was quite annoying. Also, we didn't realize we had to tip the housekeepers (as it's not really a culture thing where I am), but I do recommend you do it or they will be quite rude to you...

570253686,50,Amazing...,"Aloha!! I stayed at the beautiful Ritz Carlton Residences, Waikiki on March 18 - 23. All I can say is ""Wow"" !!    Upon arrival I was greeted with a beautiful lei and was personally escorted to the registration area. I was celebrating a milestone birthday and was treated like royalty.    My room was a Grand, Studio, King bed, Ocean view suite on the 33rd Floor. The Guest Relations staff honored me with a beautiful fresh fruit platter. The fruits were all tropical and exotic and very tasty.    The view was breathtaking. I had a private balcony from which to view the ocean. The King bed was very comfortable and the soaking bath tub was welcome at the end of the day.    I wish to publicly acknowledge Andrea in Guest Relations for her assistance with a request. She went above and beyond to go the extra mile.    It was only a 5-minute quick walk to the beach. The location was perfect for shopping, dining and walking. I even found a yoga studio, Yogaloha, down the street.    The onsite fitness center was perfect. A large selection of free weights, weight machines, and elliptical machines. They provided towels, water and even fresh apples.    The BLT Market and Bar served delicious, fresh food and beverages. I ate several meals there and was never disappointed.    The entire staff was so attentive. It rained very hard one afternoon and they provided large umbrellas to keep me dry. Housekeeping staff cleaned the room each morning and did a turn-down service at night with chocolates on the bedside table.    I cannot say enough about this amazing property. It was so quiet that I never heard other guests above, below or next to me. My room was by the elevator and it was so quiet and not an issue.

569995575,50,Worthy of the all the great reviews!,"As before most of our trips, I did a ton of research on the best hotels in Oahu. What follows is a long and detailed review so read on at your own risk! We considered the Four Seasons at Ko Olina and others before settling on the Ritz Carlton Residences. Reading the reviews for the hotel prior to arrival, I was confident in the choice but had a few concerns. These concerns were the location not being beachside, the size of the pool, and the ongoing construction of the second tower. I'm happy to report that these concerns were unwarranted in my experience.    First, the location was near perfection. Yes, it is not beachside but the beach is just a two block walk away. In fact, we preferred to walk down the beach a few minutes as the beach near the Royal Hawaiian was a little less crowded and nicer. The view from the Ritz was fantastic with a water view over the adjacent park. For me, the location not being beachside was not a detractor as we still visited the beach at Waikiki twice and spent another beach day on the North Shore. Just around the corner from the Ritz was all the high end action of Waikiki with fantastic shops and restaurants.    The pool was not huge but it was big enough for my family with our 14 and 11 year old to have great fun. Yes, it could be a little crowded at the peak of the afternoon but it was more of a ""fun"" crowded than overcrowded. The quality of the pool with an infinity edge and its two hot tubs was excellent as were the staff at the pool. They have cabanas for rent for a very reasonable cost but we never had an issue finding chairs so we chose not to rent a cabana. Bottom line, we loved the pool and went every day!    It looks like the construction of the second tower is nearing completion but it was no issue for us whatsoever. We never heard any construction noise from our room or anywhere else in the hotel with the exception of the spa oddly enough. That said, I had two 50 minute relaxation massages which were very good and there was was no construction noise in the treatment rooms. I do think the completion of the second tower with the big resort pool will be a bonus for the resort.    We stayed in a two bedroom suite which was perfect for our family of four. One bedroom had a king and balcony access while the other had a queen bed. My son chose to sleep on the full/queen size sleeper sofa as opposed to sharing his bed with his sister. All the beds were wonderfully comfortably including the sofa sleeper which was insanely comfy for a pull-out bed. They must put a feather pad or something on it. There was a small kitchenette with a almost full size refrigerator and freezer along with a dining table that sat 6. The balcony was large with access from the living room and the master bedroom. Overall, the suite was perfect for a family of 4 or 5. Pristinely modern and clean. Our room was on the 18th floor (1802) and the view of water was sweet!    The staff were top notch as you would expect from a Ritz Carlton. The valet staff were numerous and couldn't be more helpful whether it be to help you with your car, your bags, or to provide bags with towels and water for a beach trip. The concierges were always ready to advise you on local activities or set them up for you. Tomo, the front desk manager, and his staff were exceptional. Tomo helped me get some business done during my stay and was a consummate professional. The housekeepers seemed omnipresent yet never intrusive and kept our room pristine. The turndown service every night included preparing the sofa bed without our having to ask after the first night. Overall, the staff rocked.    We ate at BLT Market for breakfast and it was wonderful with its open air feel and water view. We didn't get a chance to try Sushi Sho but I hear it is incredible. We did room service one night after a long beach day and it did not disappoint. It arrived quickly and hit the spot.    Overall, the Ritz was a big part of our best Hawaiian vacation ever! There is no doubt it is a five star hotel. I would say it ranks in my top two hotels ever along with the new Fairmont Pacific Rim in Vancouver.

If you want a place that can not fail you and cannot go wrong in any way then this is the place.    I had the pleasure of staying at this hotel last week and I had an amazing stay. The hotel has a very modern, luxurious and clean look to it and so do the rooms. The view from the room was spectacular as you get the beach and partial sunset views. The room we stayed in had a king size bed which was super comfortable and a sofa bed (which was meh). I really enjoyed all the amenities that it included as it made life so much easier (fridge, coffee maker, washer and dryer). Yes, there was a washer and dryer so I was able to do my laundry before I left for home and not have to carry dirty or stinky beach clothes back home. I don't think I have mentioned that the customer service here is on point; from the moment you are greeted, to the lobby, to bell boy, to housekeeping, to valet, to the pool to the gym and back, they are all smiles and if you need anything, just ask, they will take care of you. Don't forget to ask for your beach bags when going out for a beach day. Also, I must say that I specially appreciate the late afternoon/evening housekeeping check ins. Yup, housekeeping does a second round to see if you need anything else that has come up during the day, like more towels, or maybe your sofa bed needs to be set up?

Our room had a welcome fruit plate which was much appreciated! They also had bumpers on the bed for my children. I loved that they emailed me before my stay to gather more information on my stay. Valet was THE best. They had our car ready with beach bags, towels. chairs, umbrellas and water on all our beach days! They were quick and efficient.  The hotel is a short walk to waikiki beach, which we didn't mind. We stayed in a two bedroom suite and it was the perfect amount of space for my family. The view was amazing. Housekeeping was impeccable.  We go to Hawaii 1-2 times a year and we usually switch up the hotel to try out new ones, but I will stick to the ritz Carlton from now on!

556346834,50,"Great resort, taken over the top to wonderful by the staff","Lovely, spacious suite. Great security on the property, and very nice and clean. It still feels like a bit of a work in progress in some areas- the pool area is nice, but very small, and can be a wait to get a lounge chair. The spa area feels like office space that has been converted- Im sort of assuming that the final spa will be in the second building that isn't finished yet. Room service is delicious (its from the restaurant near the pool)! The eggs benedict is perfection. But, what makes this a resort to absolutely visit is the staff. I have never experienced such a delightful staff at any property I have ever visited, including the Ritz Carlton on Maui. Attentive, friendly, helpful- just a lovely, lovely group of individuals.  A few other tips- the gym may look small, but is great! The machines will allow you to get a solid workout in! ( my husband lifts weights very seriously, as do I, although not as heavy obviously)  Dean and Deluca is great for dessert, and some food options- do not miss the lemon tarts (heaven!!), or the uber tarts! Avoid the chicken caesar, and the ahi poke wasn't the best. The veggie lasagna was fabulous! Also, the coffee (espresso) was vile. This is partly personal taste- much of the Honolulu espresso is from a blond, very citrusy blend with a bitter finish. I prefer a cocoa note espresso.  All that said- stay there!

553032640,20,"Fit for Business, NOT a Resort Property","When designing a property owners must always make trade-offs between revenue producing square footage and straight amenity locations, which create the feeling of luxury for guests. Business hotels where guests work late and leave early can error on the side of lower leisure square footage but when guests are coming to enjoy time off they want places to hang out and unfortunately this property is sadly lacking. The pool is postage stamp size and the fact that there are very few lounge chairs makes it even worse. It is so overcrowded that guests sit around the edge of the fireplace waiting for a proper chair. or place on the couch around the fireplace. Their solution? Wait in the pool or your room and we'll call when things open up. In many hotels there would be some green space, gardens or a spacious lobby to wait or enjoy but not here. Once again, they obviously decided that they were not revenue-producing. The staff are friendly and service-oriented, the housekeeping is excellent, the gym is well-equipped and the food is good but these things can't make up for the bad design. The property is not on the beach so they need a better pool as this one had at the minimum 16 crying screaming, splashing kids in it at all times. It was anything but relaxing and there were no rules enforced on the kids. They are opening up a second tower and when they do one pool will be a kids pool and one an adult pool but the new tower will double the occupancy so unless it is 3 times bigger with multiple more lounge chairs it is not going to make this a true luxury property.",Jan 2018,January 2018,Traveled as a couple,,"Toronto, Canada"

542514690,50,Best Hotel in Waikiki Hands Down,"I was looking for 3 things for my 3 day hotel stay in Honolulu (1) A spectacular View (2) not a beaten-up run down place and (3) not in the middle of partyville.    And the R_C wins on all counts. Brand new hotel, everything in lovely condition. Modern and uptodate appliances in the room together with the customary Ritz-Carlton luxury. Its a 10 minute walk to the beach and Waikiki, so close enough without being a hike.    Now, the pool is a little narrow, so if there is a kids swimming, its a challenge to swim lengths, but there are 2 hot tubs and space, so all not lost.    The only odd thing, which is more odd than a negative is the bathroom slippers. The slippers provided are in Japanese lady foot size. And there are a lot of Japanese ladies staying here, and I am sure they are very happy. But I am neither Japanese not a lady and my size 11's, well it was hopeless. So I called own to reception to request a bigger pair and I was declined. Only one size I was told. Whaat? I was also told that they are discussing introducing bigger sizes and it has yet to be decided. Whats to discuss? Its not as if they are monogrammed or super special. Just get bigger slippers.

The unit had it all, but for me it really was all about the view and the balcony. Until we get to the pool. In all my world travels, I have never observed and experienced superior performance like that of three Ritz-Carlton pool personnel. The trio of Momo, Mitch, and Devon are in a class by themselves. They sincerely made us feel like royalty. All three take their responsibilities very seriously and it shows.

Overall, we were very pleased because of the warmth and gracious hospitality of the staff. They are by far the best we have ever encountered. So worth it. We would stay there every time we visit Honolulu because of the genuinely friendly staff and the amenities. The room is cozy but fully loaded. Refrigerator, freezer, dinette, stove, microwave, washer-dryer, balcony, Bidet....it is modern and luxurious. A must for families to want options.

My package included breakfast at BLT (USD130 extra per night as compared with travel agent rate without breakfast). Food quality is good but I was only allowed to order 1 hot dish + 1 coffee/tea + 1 drink (very rare for a 5 star hotel). I then received a revised bill after I checked out charging me breakfast USD95.72 because I had breakfast after the breakfast time (which is not true of course)... Balcony has a view of beach but quite far away. I was told by staff about 20 minutes walk to beach. It was too hot to walk in the daytime and too dark at night time (need to pass through carpark lot without lighting) therefore I ended up went back hotel after 10 minutes walk and have no chance going/seeing the beach. There was noise in the daytime because Phase 2 is under construction. Hotel staff kindly let me checked out after staying 1 night and welcome me to go back when construction is finished. Hotel staff are all very friendly I must say. Decor and hardwares is not the finest, Room is very spacious. Washer/dryer not working.

Yeah Baby!!!,"I found it all very intoxicating & alluring to step out of my taxi to be greeted by the Carlton ritz residences staff by name & what was most impressive was that it was actually MY name! How did they know that it was me when we had arrived 8 hrs before normal check in time & were welcomed with colossal amounts of respect, strange thing to write but that's what it was, respect like I've never had from staff anywhere before! Wow what an outstanding team. I would have to say the staff here are nothing short of incredible, full credit to the CR management for training to such a high level, you truly have an outstanding staff.  Now some things to know about CRR  There is no mini bar, no 24 hr room service which I love, but it is not a hotel, it is residences. Once I got my head around the lack of normal hotel facilities I coped fine.  The apartments are appointed beautifully & nothing is O.T.T is all very understated. Soooo tasteful. So spacious. It is also a block from the beach but you can see it over there & it's only a 5 or so min walk. The resin fences are located in the middle of the Waikiki hype & are literally right in the middle of the Chanel, Prada, Tiffany's & D&G shopping so leaving the foyer is horribly expensive as you walk past all those windows every time you leave the building.  Our rooms were serviced every time we were out actually we didn't see one maid or even one trolley. Turn down service every night, again didn't see anyone doing this but they did it.

We came with young children and were worried that they wouldn't fit in with the sleek decor and cool vibe but they couldn't have been made more welcome. Terrific service by all staff, and generous smiles across the board. Concierge staff couldn't be more helpful.    The other great thing about this hotel is that you're very close to wonderful shopping on the main street but not right in it. You're a little bit removed from the noise. You also have access to a wonderful deli on the ground floor that makes excellent coffee and pastries.    We would have loved to dine in the hotel restaurant more often but kids were a little rowdy. Nevertheless, nearby Californian Pizza Restaurant (which serves a great variety of good quality foods) and Tommy Bahamas upstairs were excellent choices and very kid friendly options.    Waikiki Beach is a little far to walk in the heat but taxis are readily available. I wouldn't take the bus as they're mostly tourist buses. If you can work out when and where it stops, the pink line (orange double decker buses) are ok too.    Otherwise, walking directly to the beach from the hotel through the park is quite quick and the beach there (the Royal Moana) is probably nicer anyway.

Great proximity to shopping and restaurants, it's a 10 minute easy walk to the beach. What blew us away was the level of hospitality at this resort.    It was my first time in Hawaii so we opted for Oahu as opposed to Maui or Kawaii. We spent 7nights/8 days here and didn't want to leave!    The infinity pool is great to lounge around and get the view without sand getting everywhere. Great drinks at BLT, the bar by the pool. We recommend the Mai Tai!    Spa is a bit smaller but has a boutique feel. We did the 80 Minute Deep Tissue massage. Volcanic Hot Stones were a nice upgrade. Hubs enjoyed his scalp massage upgrade as well.    The rooms were large, very clean, and had a small kitchenette with a cold fridge and freezer. We stocked up on drinks and ice cream so we wouldn't have to leave the room. They also come equipped with a washer and dryer which was really great for an extended stay.    Lastly and most importantly, what made this a 5-Star experience was the concierge. Laurie and David helped us book.. no.. they took care of everything! We asked for a rental car, and it was here waiting for us. Sign a few papers and done!

513027710,50,Great service,This was our first time staying at the Ritz-Carlton. We stayed here for our honeymoon and was very pleased with the quality of the hotel and the service we received. Every request that we had was addressed promptly and had no issues during our entire stay. We visited the pool late at night around 11 pm and the staff greeted us with a pair of towels and water bottles. The location of the hotel is less than 5 min walking distance to the malls and very close to the Hard Rock café. It was about 10 minute walk to the beach. It may not be on the beach but our room had a wonderful view of the beach itself. We also had a good view of the fireworks display on Friday night while relaxing with some cocktails by the pool. We highly recommend the Ritz-Carlton due to the professional service from the staff and location/quality of the hotel.,Aug 2017,August 2017,Traveled as a couple,,"Waikiki, United States"

510387888,50,Excellent stay at Ritz-Carlton Residences Waikiki,"We had an eight night stay at the Ritz-Carlton Residences Waikiki recently. It exceeded our expectations & was a wonderful trip. We were greeted with a warm welcome, leis, & frozen pineapple drinks when we arrived. The check in process was quick, & the staff was very friendly. The room was a good size, with nice amenities like a stocked kitchenette & an in room washer & dryer. The housekeeping staff was truly wonderful. The turn down service not only made the bed each night, but also prepped & put away the sleeper sofa for our daughter. Additionally, they provided a surprise piece of birthday cake for our daughter's birthday without even being asked. And when they found that she liked the lemonade that was provided in the lobby, they surprised her with a complimentary pitcher in the fridge when we returned from one of our daily outings. When we went to check out, they provided yet another surprise in the form of a farewell note, balloons for our daughter, & a piece of fresh berry vanilla cake.

507965564,30,Let down by noisy air-conditioning,"This is a luxury hotel about 500 yards from Kahanamoku Beach that is separated from the main Waikiki Beach, but quieter. Facilities include pool, spa but only one main restaurant, used for all meals including breakfast. The room has self-catering facility and a clothes washer & dryer, which is a plus. Breakfast was no better than average, and not buffet. However, the worst feature was a very poorly-designed air-conditioning duct system that was very noisy, came on and off intermittently through the night, and disturbed our sleep both nights we stayed there. As a good sleep is the most important hotel function, this is a big downer for this hotel. It would be a very expensive option for them to fix, I would imagine... clearly a design fault in the building.",Aug 2017,July 2017,Traveled as a couple,Check the noise from the air-con before accepting any room.,"Sydney, Australia"

I used several services at the hotel including the spa, the gym, and the pool. All of them were awesome and I was treated very well in all aspects. I had my own room on the 29th floor and the view was amazing! In fact the room was so clean, it made me not want to leave it. The location is also great...just a few blocks from the beach and close to the main shopping area. If i come back to Waikiki, I cannot imagine staying at another hotel. Just a few minor complaints...the bar closes at 10. I would prefer if it was open later and there are not very many food options in the hotel. There are only 2 restaurants in the hotel and the one I ate at was absolutely excellent but I feel a few more options would be beneficial. Still these are minor complaints on what was an incredible stay. Recommended",Jul 2017,July 2017,Traveled solo,,"Rolling Hills Estates, California"

504994174,50,Simply Wonderful!!!,"My family and I have been Ritz-Carlton guests for over 12 years. It is my pleasure to let you know that the staff at Waikiki exceed our expectations and Ritz-Carlton standards......they embodied the theme of ""Ladies and Gentlemen serving Ladies and Gentlemen"" and went beyond that, as they managed to make us feel as though we were family. Justin, the manager went above and beyond when my son forgot his cell phone in our hotel room. We were at the pier getting ready to board our cruise when we called the hotel in a complete panic to see if they could assist us. Laurie at concierge, along with the front desk, and Justin all worked together and managed to get a driver (Mike) to bring the phone to us at the pier; as a result, we were still able to board the Pride of America on time! Maria and Sandy were the first Ladies of the Ritz @ Waikiki to greet us....and they were so warm, friendly, and generous. Maria knew we were a bit dehydrated so she made certain to get us water and fruit (yum!) ; Sandy was so kind to send us chamomile tea, some local adorable memorabilia, and wrote us a beautiful personalized note. Trevor at the front desk did something that we not only did not expect, but we were overwhelmed with gratitude when we realized the amount time and effort he put into doing a very special project for us. Trevor knew that we were going to be visiting his home island, Kauai. He created a personalized colorful portfolio for us which included detailed maps, instructions, and activities based upon our needs. We were so very impressed and so very grateful for this unsolicited help!! Trevor did an amazing job of anticipating our needs. (THANK YOU TREVOR!!) RJ and Chris at the Garage Level also were wonderful and helpful to us. They not only provided us assistance with cabs and luggage, but also made us reservations at The Cheesecake Factory (which normally does not accept reservations) . I simply cannot say enough about the Ladies and Gentlemen of The Ritz Carlton Waikiki except to say that it truly was our pleasure to be a guest....and we will most certainly return.

When we settled on an island we thought ""Ritz Carlton"" should be perfect, it's our honeymoon after all!    Wrong. So, so wrong.    While the staff was exceptional (friendly and helpful), the hotel itself was terrible. The hotel and decor felt outdated, and it's ridiculously overpriced for the amenities you ""get"". The hotel has one, ONE, option for dining... Which is also overpriced and mediocre at best.    The concierge service did their best to offer outings and assistance, but you are much better off researching and discovering things on your own.    I'm disappointed in my honeymoon, and sad I made the choice of this hotel as a place for my forever memory.

I was shocked to see I was charged with the package when I check out. The hotel insisted to say they told me already and promised me get back to me but FAILED AGAIN to get back to me.

The readings on The Ritz were excellent but my agent said "" hey wait they are a residence "" so service will be reduced. Well I had to try and I can tell you that the Ritz Residences at Oahu along with the GM and his staff are exceptional.

493627099,50,Perfect Waikiki spot!,So we're not exactly Waikiki regulars but this isn't our first rodeo either and I think out of our three visits this is far my favorite location and hotel!! I'm comparing to the big pink Royal Hawaiian and dare I say the Trump Hotel. I'm not focusing on those but will let you know why I think RCR is better.    1. The people and staff!!!- from pulling up the valets were top notch and remembered my name each time even if we were just walking through. Kudos to Ryan my favorite. But everyone will make you feel appreciated and will go out of their way to make you happy.    2. The Location- this hotel is located right across from the park with a flawless view to the ocean. Even though you're not on the beach you are only a block away and if you're like us this is just the first Island before on a many more to come so if this is your shopping stop you have hit the mother load and can do the beach on your next stops. Also great jump off to the highway for great site seeing and North Sea visits. But all and all located on tip of Kalakaua Ave (main drag) so you can throw yourself into the crazy tourist scene or not.    3. The Room- we had a deluxe ocean front studio on a middle level and it was perfect. The room was more than comfortable it was spacious and well pointed. The two highlights are the extremely quiet washer and dryer and the TOTO toilet....you need to go to Japan or go to the RCR and experience the thrill of the TOTO!!    I can't comment on any restaurants since we ate out all four nights nor can I comment on the pool but it looked beautiful but I don't think you will regret staying here and will truly enjoy your stay!,Jun 2017,May 2017,Traveled as a couple,,"Washington DC, District of Columbia"
493578410,50,Deserves more than 5 stars!,"From check-in to check-out, this stay was absolutely wonderful. My family enjoyed our two bedroom ocean-view suite at this beautiful luxury hotel.    The room was perfect, excellent color choices and material palette. The rooms always smelled great, the housekeeping came by twice a day. Anything we wanted would be delivered: extra pots or pans, nail clippers, etc. It was such a lovely room we did not want to leave. The beds were like clouds and we all slept so well every night. The only negative we had was that the showers had no doors and water often got out of the shower area. There were also no shelves for the showering necessities like shampoo and conditioner, and we had to bend down multiple times per shower to use all of that. But that's minor.    The construction noises were a problem only on some mornings, but that cannot be avoided and the hotel staff took care of us.    What really made this trip perfect and this stay at Ritz was the hotel staff. We enjoyed the company of our family from Hawaii, the Ritz staff. They made sure we had everything we needed and helped celebrate a birthday as well as an achievement. When we left the underwater camera in one of the towel bags, it was delivered to us poolside when we had completely forgotten about it! That's what you call service.

I couldn't believe how quickly someone came to help me with my tv at 2am.  The units are nice and spacious, and have good size lanai. The kitchen features a small sub-Z refrigerator, wine fridge, stove and dishwasher, along with anything you will need for your stay. The bedroom is completely separated from the living area, however the bathroom is connected to the bedroom and offers little privacy, should you have a guest.  The bathroom is lovely, with a complete bathtub and separate shower, and heated toto toilet with bidet. The toiletries are wonderful and everything you could possibly need is there.  There is a smaller sized infinity pool and a hot tub on the property. The pool area, while small is very nice. There are private cabanas with tvs and safes if you desire. The pool staff is very attentive and professional. I was very impressed with the service in the pool area.  The hotel sits less than a block from the beach and offers lovely views of Diamondhead and the ocean.

We stayed in a one-bedroom suite that has some view of Waikiki Beach. The suite was nice but a little too muted. My one complaint about the bedroom was that the full length mirror was a bit of a walk from the closet.    This Ritz Carlton is actually an ownership hotel. Unfortunately, it does not participate in the Marriott, the Ritz Carlton, and the SPG rewards programs.    There are three restaurants on site. We ate breakfast at the BLT Market. The menu was a bit boring so we decided not to go back. The second restaurant is actually a branch of Dean & DeLuca. That was a pleasant surprise for me. We had a late brunch at the market and the sandwiches were very good. Dean & DeLuca has wine and cheese in the afternoons. It's a little like a tapas bar, I am guessing. The top floor where the bar is has a wide selection of charcuteries. We weren't able to try it.    The third restaurant is Sushi Sho by Tokyo's famed Chef Nakazawa. For $300 per person, you can be one of the lucky ten diners. That was a bit out of our price range so we opted to eat elsewhere.

And the beach is far enough from the busiest points of Waikiki so that you can actually get an umbrella and beach chair that isn't squeezed into a zillion other chairs. The ocean views aren't cheap but they are spectacular as there is no obstruction. The pool and jacuzzis are great on a hot day. Pool service is amazing.

479390713,50,"All time ""Best Hotel"" for Service and Accommodations!","The staff at the Ritz Carlton Waikiki are exceptional - by far the best service I've ever experienced, and i am a seasoned traveler having visited over 45 different countries and stayed at top notch hotels. My 2nd favorite hotel so far is the W HOTEL - Maldives.    David Nakamura - is a God send and an exceptional concierge staff member! He proactively anticipated and handled all my needs - from scheduling a private car service for my elderly mother who came in hours after my arrival, arranged wheelchair access for her at the airport (arrival and departure - which i never thought of to ask), bought us beach chairs and umbrellas for the beach (which we left at the hotel for other guests to enjoy), made sure our room was high enough and away from any dust from the construction, given my mother's lung tumor diagnosis, and even took time to research where to buy a specific item my mother wanted purchased from Hawaii.    Of course there were other staff members that deserve my praise and gratitude - upon arrival my american ATM card was deactivated (without my knowledge) and i was stuck for 4 days without access to cash to tip the staff for their service. Never once did their exceptional level of service falter, or was it any less than what i would expect had i tipped them well. The staff was very helpful with recommending which restaurants and shows to see, which supermarkets to buy reasonably priced groceries during our stay, and where to go shopping.    ACCOMMODATIONS:  The room was well designed, gorgeous, clean and spacious. The bed was exceptionally comfortable, and felt like a cloud - not too soft, but perfect enough for me after a long flight from HK. It came with a washer and dryer, nespresso coffeemaker and a proper kitchen to cook from if you're traveling with kids or elderly parents who may have restrictive diets. The Smart TV's in the suite, made it easy to log into our HULU, NETFLIX and PANDORA accounts - thank you for that! Oh and did i mention that their is free, high quality WiFi service through out the hotel, without the need to log-in ever- which can be so annoying.    BEACH ACCESS:  The Hotel is about 5 mins away from the beautiful Waikiki beach, exactly 4 streets away - and a very easy walk. My mother is 70 yrs old with bad knees, and the walk wasn't any hassle at all for her. At the beach you can easily find activities to do and places to eat. You can rent 2 beach chairs with umbrella for $25/hr. NOTE: All the vendors can be found directly in front of the entrance to the beach, which is a straight line from the hotel.    SHOPPING & RESTAURANTS:  The hotel is situated at the beginning of the main street where you will find all the best shops and restaurants to visit - KALAKAUA Ave. This avenue is about 2 miles long and the perfect place to sight-see and find things to do during the evening hours.    POOL  The hotel pool is medium sized and gets sun after 12 noon, however it never gets too full, and you can always find a chair and umbrella. There's always a constant supply of fresh towels, flavored water and free fruit to snack on when lounging. The pool staff is very pleasant and attentive, and the hotel's restaurant offers delicious and healthy dishes.    Overall i love this hotel and their staff !! I look forward to visiting Hawaii again, and staying ONLY at this hotel. If i had the money, i would buy one of their hotel suites, as their staff and attention to service is exceptional.

Our only qualm was the price for a jug of coffee sent by room service, (a whopping $25) - even though we ordered it at the bar downstairs and were happy to wait. Overall, however, this is one of the nicest, if not the best hotel in Waikiki - we stayed at the Sheraton Waikiki on our final night and we were in for a shock after our time at the Ritz Carlton.

478297853,50,Great Staff,"I've never actually left a review publicly for anything but I have to share my experience with the Ritz Carlton Waikiki. What really stood out at this property were the staff. From the moment we checked in until the moment we checked out staff were attentive, discrete, thorough, and most of all they just genuinely seem to really enjoy providing the service that they did. My Fiancée and I are admittedly picky when we travel and it is rare that something doesn't meet with at least a less than favourable comment from one of us - I actually remarked to her upon our departure that this was probably the first time I had stayed at any hotel where EVERYTHING met my expectations.    This was thrown into stark contrast when we visited the Four Seasons in Ko'Olina, one of the island's other ""premiere"" properties later in the week. As this is a review of the Ritz I won't elaborate on the Four Seasons here other than to say the difference in the care of the staff was glaring.    The Ritz Waikiki was clean, amenities were great, and in some ways it was nice to be away from the beach - the pool on the (7th?) floor provided a decent view and was staffed well and only moderately busy at most during our stay.

472253644,40,Not Quite Putting On The Ritz,"As one of the newest hotels in Waikiki we were anxious to see what the Ritz Carlton would bring to the recently revived Kuhio Ave. Once you arrive at the grand tower with a second tower under construction next door you are greeted with a fairly mundane driveway as the lobby is located upstairs.    When you arrive at the lobby the view through Fort De Russy is park is breathtaking and you are immediately excited because all the rooms look out onto this captivating view.    We had purchased this package through Luxury Escapes and having stayed at many Ritz Carlton properties throughout Asia, we were expecting a beautiful room. The first thing we did notice was how filthy the pale green carpet was outside the elevator. The room didn't stun on first glance, it was fresh and bright and in a similiar soft green palate to the rest of the hotel.    It was also very compact made to look even more so by the kitchen/washer/dryer that ran along the wall, which resembled a flat pack installation from Ikea.    After a long flight that arrived in the am and a check in that wasn't till 4pm. I wanted a leisurely soak in the bath. The bath tub was a compact Japanese soaker which you sit in. Despite a step I needed a pole vault to get in. My husband anxiously stressed to take care getting out but unfortunately I slipped trying to swivel out and not being able to touch the floor landed on the tiles.    There was no way I was going to spend 7 days enduring that and Olivia at reception very promptly found another room and kindly upgraded us to a normal bath. We also got about 15 extra sq metres which certainly enhanced our stay.    We loved our room and the view but the hotel itself didn't knock our socks off. So much opportunity to do something amazing when so few new hotels are actually built in Waikiki and the Ritz just didn't do it. The staff however were amazing, helpful, eager to please and personable.    We had two amazing facials in the spa and the pool area while compact does boast Honolulu's highest infinity pool. The gym area is fabulous with some of the best equipment we've used in a hotel in a while. It was just a shame that one guest thought it was acceptable to sweat profusely over equipment, windows and the floor. We couldn't use equipment within a metre radius of him without getting sweat flicked on us. Perhaps instructions and sanitiser should be installed to advise guests of proper gym etiquette.    The bedding was also a little bizarre, rather than a normal mattress topper we had a donna under our sheet. We discovered this after running hot all night, housekeeping removed it for us the next day. However the bottom sheet isn't big enough to tuck into the mattress, meaning it balls up and moves during the night.    We were also disappointed with the choice of food. There was the BLT market that did one of the worst Chicken Club Sandwiches I have eaten in a while. Not only didn't it resemble a Club Sandwich it didn't even make it as a passable chicken sandwich. Breakfasts were OK but limited A la Carte choices mean't we went elsewhere for breakfast. Try Bill's for great scrambled eggs.    If you are looking for a new property in Hawaii that boasts a perfect location and amazing view then this is the one for you. Unlike the old and dated Marriotts and Hyatts everything is new and modern and not circa 1970's.    Although if you want something really quirky and fun check out the new Laylow a brand new boutique hotel on Kuhio Ave thats just opened.

We stayed in a 1 bedroom, and it was perfect for our family of 3. Plenty of space, and the room felt very clean, bed was comfortable. We did not cook at all, but it was handy having a full-sized fridge, and microwave if we wanted to heat something up. Also great having a washing machine/dryer. We did a load toward the end of our stay so we didn't pack a suitcase full of dirty clothes going home. Housekeeping always came when we requested, and refilled waters for us.    The restaurant is great. Not amazing, but solid service, and good food. Standouts are the garlic fries, the complimentary Brazilian cheese bread (gluten-free), and the poke. My husband really enjoyed their club sandwich by the pool. I loved their options for kids--they had beyond the ""chicken tenders"" and ""grilled-cheese"" and actually offered balanced meal options for the little ones. My daughter also brought home a few stuffed animals offered by the amazing valet/bellman staff.    We were always able to find seating by the pool. It's not huge, but had 2 hot tubs and was clean. The service by the pool was great too. The location of the hotel is slightly nestled off the end of the strip where it starts to become less busy.    The only reason why I think we would stay somewhere else next time, is that this hotel lacked the ""resort feel"" which, looking back in hindsight, was to be expected. I didn't realize that this building were mostly condos (even though the ""residences"" in the name should have given that away). We missed the ability to choose from multiple restaurants, a breakfast buffet (although I later learned this isn't big in Oahu anyway), happy hour, entertainment, a social area where people gathered each evening, etc. It was slightly sleepier than we wanted. It makes sense since it's residential, so if you know this and are okay with it, you will love the experience here. It lives up to the Ritz standard in every aspect.",Mar 2017,February 2017,Traveled with family,,"San Francisco, California"

This was our 3rd trip to Waikiki and we felt this was the best accommodation onbviuosly at an additional cost as we had 3 adults staying We got email 1 week prior to arrival asking if we had any special requests. We stayed in the 1 bedroom deluxe apartment. When we arrived, we found all our requests had been attended to like extra towels, soft pillows, sofa bed made up in the lounge up for our adult son. Tthere was a glass ranch slider between the lounge and bedroom that we could close for privacy .  Full kitchen facility, turnover service in the evening . Staff were all very friendly and helpful and went out of their way for any requests. Just be aware that the hold on your credit card is for the full amount of accommodation plus $500 usd hence converted to your own currency could be a large hold on the card even though we were going to pay cash on checkout.

460245060,30,Disappointed thus far,"I arrived at the Ritz Carlton Residences last night after midnight, exhausted from a  very long day of air travel, and excited to get into my room, prepaid and confirmed. The night staff were very nice but completely incapable of running a credit card to  cope with ""incidentals"" during my 3 night stay! I was at the desk for at least 45 minutes while they apologised and tried and failed to achieve this. There was NO problem with my card and after finally allowing me into a room, they called me at 1.3O am to tell me they had finally managed it! This got things off to a pretty poor start. I do know that the hotel is relatively new and they are ironing out things but it is far from inexpensive and I have never been treated like that before in any hotel anywhere EVER before.  Ritz Carlton REsidence has no mini bar! Just a fridge which you can fill yourself. Luckily there's an ABC store nearby but really - is that good enough? I don't think so.  There are lots of kids running around screaming and I am going to post a pic of the pool which I took this afternoon. Wall to wall small children no room for adults and who would want to go there anyway?  I ordered breakfast in my room today and the order came promptly. I had to laugh! The sweet girl on the phone asked me what size pot of coffee I would like and I said 4 cup please. Up came the tray with the pot of coffee, four cups and four saucers!!!  Obviously this outfit is very far from professional.  The beds are comfortable, the bathroom great, I have an Ocean View Studio which , is just a room with a kitchen in it. Not a very large room. Adequate at best. Nice  balcony with view of the sea. Not sure I would dream of coming back here.  They claim to offer ""FREE"" Netflix but when you click on it, up comes Netflix offering you a free month's membership in exchange for YOUR credit card details! Which you have to remember to cancel.

459058470,50,This is the best hotel in Waikiki!! They make you feel so welcome!,"I can't stop telling all of my family and friends about how amazing the service at RCRWB is! Both myself and two friends stayed in a Deluxe Ocean View Studio Room for six nights and we did not ever want to go home.    The staff at Ritz-Carlton Waikīkī Beach are what made our stay so special. Our Guest Relations Agent Tomoko Miura was simply amazing, she emailed me in the weeks before our stay to confirm if we needed transport, activities or groceries booked and made sure that our card authorisation was processed without issue. Tomoko was able to upgrade us to a Deluxe Studio Room free of charge which was a lovely birthday gift. She even made sure that a birthday card and beautiful complimentary fruit platter were left in the fridge the occasion!    The concierges Laurie and Jamie were always bubbly meeting us with a big smile and a hug. They were so helpful booking six full days of activities and making us a very clear itinerary so we wouldn't get confused. We also found that the concierge Jordan was very helpful and even personally brought an itinerary up to the room one night when I had lost the original, accompanied by a map he had drawn on how to reach the pickup spot and recommendation on when we needed to depart the next day. Our concierge Laurie went so far as to send a birthday card and some sparkling wine up to our room free of charge for my birthday. You CANNOT find better service than this!    Even our valet Ryan was exceptional, he made sure to ask how our activities went every day, helped us find our way around Waikīkī and brought a range of hot teas to our room when one of our party was sick.    The standard of cleanliness in this hotel is impeccable, our room was serviced TWICE a day and housekeeping took note that we preferred our water room temperature so made sure to leave it out of the fridge. The view from the balcony was outstanding, whilst this is not a beach front hotel you can clearly see the ocean from your room. The hotel is so close to the main strip that as three ladies we felt very safe to venture out until midnight, as the hotel was always within safe distance of shops, bars and restaurants all open until 11pm.    I hope that nothing about RCRWB changes because it is simply perfect. My friends and I all agree that we will never stay anywhere else in Waikīkī again, not even the Halekulani, as the service just does not compare.    The staff made us feel like family and we can't wait to come back and do it again every year.",Feb 2017,February 2017,Traveled with friends,,"Sydney, Australia"

They will give you a beach bag with towels, water bottles ect(there is a 75$ fine if you don't return it before check out, I was told). They also have some nice restaurants/breakfast places within 5 minutes of walking time(Egg and other things, a really good Thai restaurant, IHOP..) Also has a few ABC stores just within 1-2 blocks.

456246748,50,Come Here Once And You Will Want To Come Back Again and Again,"My family and I were vacationing in Waikiki for the second time in nine months and we wanted a different experience. The first time we were in Waikiki for one week before our sons wedding to a Japanese lady on the Island of Maui. Her parents were coming from Japan and her father had never flown on an airplane before and had never been out of the country. We were coming from the east coast and knew that Hawaii was a very Japanese friendly place and a good mid-point for all of us to meet. We also knew that some of the fine dining restaurants had at least one Japanese speaking waiter on staff. Although they did not speak English, and we did not speak Japanese, we all had such wonderful experiences together that we decided to vacation together again.    We received notice that the Ritz Carlton Residences had opened in September and was offering a wonderful promotional discount deal. We decided to take advantage of the offer. Since the three bedroom apartments were all taken, we settled for the one bedroom luxury suite for each of us. Each suite had a balcony that faced the Pacific Ocean, a living room with TV, a bedroom with a king bed and TV, a kitchenette will two burner induction coil stove, regular oven, microwave oven, refrigerator/freezer, silverware, glasses, pots/ pans and dishes, utensils, washer and dryer, and a very big bathroom with a double sink. The bathroom entrance was wide and large enough to accommodate anyone in a wheel chair with a large roll-in shower and a tub, but there were no grab bars for handicap/disable person. The toilet area was separated from the rest of the bathroom by a large frosted glass door and was large enough to fit someone in a wheelchair. The entire bathroom area was separated from the rest of the suite by a large sliding door. We took advantage of the fact that we had a refrigerator and stove and went to the store and bought food for a hardy breakfast and lunch each day. At nights we went out to very nice restaurants for dinner and entertainment. We also took advantage of the washer and dryer, so that we did not have to bring too many changes of clothes.    I was told that each apartment in the hotel is privately owned and the Ritz Carlton manages and rents the apartments when the owners are not using them. The one bedroom suite we were using was approximately 570 sqft and very comfortable. Our son and his wife had arrived a few days before we did and had informed the hotel attendants that we were coming. When we arrived we were very warmly greeted like celebrities by a group of attendants on the ground floor and given an Hawaiian necklace. They unloaded our bags and escorted us up the lobby on the sixth floor. The valet parked the car. After we checked-in we were given a welcome Hawaiian fruit drink by one of the waiters from the BLT Restaurant in from of the lobby registration desk. When we arrived at our room our luggage was placed in our room, then the attendant gave us a tour and explained how each piece of equipment worked in the apartment. From the balcony we could see very clearly the Pacific Ocean, but we were not on the beach. We were approximately a block and a half from the beach. The sunsets and the views from the balcony were absolutely terrific. Directly below the balcony was the infinity pool with a constant water temperature of 81 degrees. We could also see Kalakaua Avenue where all of the high end trendy stores are located.    At the pool the two attendants on duty MoMo and Killian were very attentive and helpful. They brought us towels for the chaise lounge and the head rest and brought us a lemon water drink. There were fresh apples at the side of the pool and they offer us some apples. In addition to the main pool, there was a separate smaller kiddy pool at one end of the pool and a hot tub with lounging area to hangout at the other end. In the gym the equipment was well maintained and there were towels, head phones, water and apples. There were no trainers in the gym, but I saw separate rooms for Yoga and other types of exercise activities. The staff and attendants at this hotel are all young, friendly, energetic and really eager to serve you in anyway they can without expecting any tips or gratuities for their services. The people that came to clean the rooms in the mornings and evenings were also very friendly and eager to serve and address any of our needs, and they all appeared to be foreigners.    Our experiences at this hotel were wonderful. We asked to see several three bedroom apartments on the higher floors and they were absolutely gorgeous. Since the Ritz Carlton is currently building a second tower right next to the current tower, we will return for another family visit. The apartments in the new tower will also be privately owned.    If you stay at this hotel, you will have experiences that you will never forget, because they will all be good.",Jan 2017,January 2017,Traveled with family,If you are a couple get the luxury studio suite.

Having been to Waikiki many times, I decided to splurge this time. The RC residences are in a fantastic location. I had the larger of the 1 bedroom configurations.  The lobby is on the 7th floor. The reception area is small but functional. The pool is adjacent to the lobby and restaurants and has room for about 20 loungers in a narrow space. It felt forced, but I'm sure this will change when the second tower opens.  The residence was brand new and very well equipped. I felt the bedroom could have used a small table other than the small nightstands to leave your pocket stuff at the end of the day.  My bathroom had a 5 foot open wet room adjacent to the bathtub. I did not enjoy staring myself in the mirror while showering and having someone walk by to use the loo while showering is not my idea of luxury. In addition, there is a hand held shower head, but with no barriers in the shower, how do you use it without a flood? There was also no shelf for soap, etc. The narrow ledge around the bathtub is inappropriate for messy soap.  The toilets are the japanese heat and clean your underside type, nice but dirty fingers pushing the ""wash me"" buttons is unappealing to this traveler.

At Trump, the room cleaning service they provided was always very late( usually later than 3 p.m.) and it did cause lots of inconveniences. While, in Ritzcarlton, the cleaning service was quite earlier than before (usuaully around 9 a.m.), and their turn down service was always on time so that we could feel the coziness all the time. (They put little chocolates on the bed all the time!)  They provided beach bags when we went out, and they have some place where we could check our e-mail and print out the documents. Unlike Trump, they did mailing services international ( Not Fedex- Trump told us they could only do Fedex services, not for other international mailing services).  In the room, there were washing machine and dry machine, so it was very convenient to family traveller like us.  There is Dean and Deluca on the first floor, and in the swimming place, there were two jacuzzi, so it was good to relax and watch the sunset while swimming!  If we go to Hawaii again, we will definately go to Ritzcarlton for our stays!",Jan 2017,January 2017,Traveled with family,,"Hong Kong, China"
453245545,50,Welcome to the Ritz Carlton - new gem in Waikiki,"As I was strolling in Waikiki I was greeted by two gentleman.    I was starting a little small chat when I realized I was inside the new Ritz-Carlton.    I feel like Waikiki is transforming itself to bringing in the best companies in hospitality and they've got their gold stamp.    I took a tour inside part of the building and you could feel a sense of the aloha spirit. Every person I met were attentive, smiling and genuine.    I went to visit the lobby on a floor up, met the front desk staff, I learned that this place has recently opened three months ago and the construction that's currently going on is to finish the second tower.    I forgot to take a picture of the pool but it looked incredible. It echoes a very classic resort style look that you would expect from a high class hotel.    I will have to come back one day and stay here to actually experience their world renowned customer experience.    I am happy to have tried a morsel of it through visiting.    :)",Jan 2017,January 2017,Traveled solo,,"Las Vegas, Nevada"

Special thanks and apologies if I get spelling incorrect to Dee dee at the Concierge desk, and Moi-moi at the pool for their impeccable service.    Below were the reasons I gave a 4 review    1. Bed set up wasn't ideal. I have a family of 5 we rented a 2 bedroom and while residence was more than spacious, the 2nd bedroom was small and only contained a single bed so two of my teenagers had to share this bed, my third teenager had the pullout in the lounge, my husband and I the master. The lounge was big enough to have another rollaway but there was too much furniture in the open plan space to put it had this been an option.    2. No bathroom door to close ensuite off from master bedroom. When using the bathroom you felt you had little or no privacy.    3.

449476885,50,Consistently Exceptional Service in a Beautiful Modern Apartment Style Hotel,"I should start by saying that we have fallen hard for Hawaii, and now that we're in Maui, I'm falling even harder still. But first, let's talk about this hotel, our first stop after an awful Jetstar flight that was thoroughly forgettable and a reminder of why we rarely fly with them! Sadly, we were too late for the Qantas flight ...    We arrived in Honolulu tired and grumpy and stiff; despite this, we were immediately charmed and delighted by the staff at this hotel (and that's despite the fact that we didn't get our room until late in the afternoon!). We loved Waikiki, and we loved this hotel. It is new and modern and sparkling clean, but what made it exceptional were the beautiful, friendly, ever-cheerful, forever- helpful staff, for whom precious little was too much trouble (if it was within their power). From the person who greeted you on arrival with those delicious floral leis to the young woman by the pool and from the reception staff to the super-knowledgable staff at the concierge desk, the staff were first class. They were friendly and helpful, without feeling fake or disingenuous (which some hotel staff can't quite pull off). Special mention to David at the Concierge Desk, who was absolutely wonderful and to the very stylish and beautifully groomed man who seemed to be ubiquitous, anticipating your every need before you even knew you had it yourself; seriously. I think he was in charge of the concierge staff and he was exceptional.    Our apartment was very spacious and nicely furnished, and we really appreciated having access to Netflix on the TVs (there were 3 in our 3 bedroom apartment). The views of the ocean were wonderful (and will only improve when the second tower is completed - we looked over the construction site from our room which was a bit ugly but no drama and we weren't at all affected by any noise issues). If I had to make helpful suggestions, I would say the apartment could be better appointed in terms of an electric jug or kettle for boiling water (rather than relying on the hot plate), fresh milk in the fridge, some mugs for tea and coffee (rather than just cups) and a lighter blanket for the beds (in addition to the beautiful comforters) for people who prefer less warm bed covers. The other thing that was a bit perplexing were the lounge chairs without arms (meant you couldn't really ""lounge"" on them!) in the living room (but the sofa was big and nice). Some extra cushions would also be great. Having said that, the beds were super comfy (as good as the Heavenly beds at the Westin!) and it was great having a washer and dryer; we really did love this place.",Jan 2017,December 2016,Traveled with family,,"Sydney, Australia"

449070550,40,One week with family,The 2 bedroom apartment we rented was great. The master bed was large and spacious with the second bedroom being a proper double but no views etc. We were on the corner which meant the living area had views on two walls - really positive. Quality was high as was to be expected with the newish hotel and the service seemed quite personal rather than being part of the masses. Would have been better still if the pool was a little larger so you could do laps and if it was on the beach - but everything is a trade off.

Very close to main street of Waikiki. You can approach Waikiki beach in 5-7 minuets by walk. Also there are lots of stuff you might wanna look at around this area.

Our initial greeting by staff was wonderful (leis, wet towels, drinks and smiles), but for the rest of the stay was more hit and miss. On the last night 5 staff members were having their own little chat/joke on the ground floor desk and didn't even acknowledge us as we walked in. Ryan was one person who was consistently warm & helpful and also the poolside team.    The room was quiet and the bed was divine. The wardrobe was not adequate for a 9 night stay. The only chest of 3 drawers was inside it with the safe on top of the drawers so there wasn't enough space to even hang a shirt without the bottom getting crumpled. The small amount of full length space was shared with the ironing board so most of our clothes were accessed out of suitcases - annoying and disappointing for a 5 star hotel.    The shower was fine but a word of warning about the tub - even with the step provided, I found it challenging to get in/out of and I'm pretty strong and flexible (see pic).    I loved the kitchenette which was well equipped and gave us the freedom to make our own breakfast and snacks. Housekeeping staff didn't always clean the room thoroughly so a dustpan and brush for crumbs etc. would have been helpful. The housekeeping didn't live up to 5 star service, my soap dish wasn't cleaned once in 9 days, some days we had to ask for more shower gel but there would be 3 or 4 shampoos there.

I cannot put into words the amazing service we received at this Hotel.  Every single staff member we interacted with was so friendly and welcoming. From the greeting we received when we first arrived in the entrance and being escorted to the reception on the Lobby level. We were presented with traditional leis on our arrival as well as bottled water  In the lobby we were given welcome drinks with the option to add dark rum if we felt inclined - which we did.  Our room was a studio room on the 9th floor. Our view wasn't the best you could get in this property as we were rather low but we could see the ocean over Fort De Russey Park. We had a lounge area and a nice, very very very comfortable King bed. The bathroom was large with a great shower, double basins and a small bath. The TV was a smart TV with a huge range of channels and you could even log in with your own Netflix account and watch it on the TV. The kitchenette had a sink and a Nespresso machine and other appliances like toaster and microwave, plates, glasses and utensils  The only negatives about our room were that lack of anywhere to put your suitcases so we had to leave them on the floor in the lounge area and as we were on a lower floor right outside our balcony were 2 large air-conditioning fans from the building next door that when they were on the noise meant we couldn't go out on the balcony. This was pretty much all day and into the evening.  The pool area was great. probably not quite big enough for the size of the property but adequate. Jordan and Robyn looked after us really well with towels and water while we relaxed by the pool and the restaurant staff kept us supplied with food and more alcoholic drinks when required.  The Hotel restaurant, BLT Market was excellent with a very good menu. We had the please of meeting Amanda who was the General Manager of BLT Market and we enjoyed several very good meals there. Her hospitality was just so genuine and she was always making sure we were being looked after or enjoying ourselves. Michele in the restaurant was also just outstanding along with all of the wait staff that were there. All of them always made sure we were happy.  From 3-5 each day they had happy hour at the bar with a selection of reduced price drinks and Drew and Melana ( I think it was Melana) were great at making Mai Tai's.  On several mornings I would go for a run out to Diamond Head and back and every time I arrived back they were ready with a bottle of cold water for me. The gym is THE BEST I have seen in a Hotel. All the weights you need, running machines and even a punch/kick bag plus battle ropes.  The day after we arrive a Dean and Deluca opened up at the entrance to the hotel and we had the pleasure of meeting Karrina who was an absolute star.  The hotel is a little way from the beach but it is an easy 10 minute walk (only because you have to wait at 2 sets of lights) to the beach. There you can hire surf boards, loungers and umbrella's. The Hotel even give you beach bags that include towels and water.  Would I stay here again? Definitely.  Thank you to every single staff member there.

Got home yesterday and missing the heat already aha,Sep 2016,September 2016,Traveled with family,,
414039193,50,Excellent Service,"I cannot rave enough about this hotel. The customer service is non stop. Honestly, it makes u feel at home. The view was extraordinary. The room we stayed in do not think anyone had stayed there before. It had a washer and dryer in the room. Literally anything u wanted was available. The security was top notch u couldn't access the elevator without your key card. Very nice",Sep 2016,September 2016,Traveled as a couple,,"Houston, Texas"
412099786,50,A home away from home,"The view from the room is fabulous from the 16th floor. The sky and ocean over green palm trees are symmetric and in harmony. The deluxe one bedroom suite is spacious and I don't need to fold the sofa bed during the day since we still have lot of space for dinning table, office table and another ottoman sofa.The king bed in the bedroom and the sofa bed in the living room have duvet covers, and the heavy ceiling-to-floor glass doors keep the waikiki noise out. This is the most quiet hotel we ever stayed in Hawaii for 10+ vacations. The washlet in the bathroom is a surpise to me and my kids. It is unneccessry to rent a car since the large grocery ""Food Pantry"" is a 7 min walk. As well Long Drugs is across the street. and there are 10+ bus routes and trolleys which have stops beside the hotel.    Walking through the park to the beach would take 5-6 min: but we enjoy the park's tropical plants, (most with a name tag on them) and many different beautiful birds. There are too many other things to mention for my wonderful vacation, but, I have to say that the service from the Ritz-Carlton staff is perfect.",Aug 2016,August 2016,Traveled with family,Ask for west side rooms to avoid noise from vent fans above Gucci store in Luxury row.,"Victoria, Canada"
409511534,50,Best Place being with Family,"New hotel and excellent service by all the employees. Also best place to stay and near to luxury low and shopping centers gave us fantastic memories. Comparing to other hotels, Ritz Carlton is new and its room conditions are just perfect. Must stay again later for sure.",Aug 2016,August 2016,,,"Seoul, South Korea"
408327605,50,Fabulous Stay at this Luxury Property,"We stayed at this newly-opened property for only 3 nights, but wished we had planned to stay longer. The rooms are cleanly decorated, light, airy and super comfortable. The bathrooms are spacious and luxurious. We had a two bedroom suite with kitchen, washer/dryer and living room area. This was perfect for my family of four. My daughter decided to try the pull out sofa (to get away from her teenage brother), and loved it. So, you can easily fit 5-6 people in the residence. The sofa bed was incredibly comfortable -- not your typical sofa bed with a thin, lumpy mattress and springs poking into your back. The staff, was super helpful -- the concierge, the greeters/car parkers on the ground floor, and especially the pool attendants. They were attentive, thoughtful and responsive. Each time we left the hotel, we were offered a bag with beach towels and cold water bottles. Jordan, one of the awesome pool attendants, was especially kind and helpful to the kids at the pool. He went out of his way to find restaurant recommendations for us one evening. Loved our stay here and hope to return someday soon! Highly recommend, especially for families looking for some extra space, and some helpful home amenities like kitchen and washer/dryer.",Aug 2016,August 2016,Traveled with family,,"Washington DC, District of Columbia"

The ocean view is quite good and the staffs are nice and considerate. The only shortcoming is the swimming pool is small.",Jul 2016,July 2016,Traveled with family,,
