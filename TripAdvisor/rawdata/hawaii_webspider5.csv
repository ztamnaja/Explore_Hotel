Excellent customer service.","We stayed here for 1 night upon our arrival and for two nights at the end of the trip. We took advantage of their valet parking which was convenient. Anytime the car was needed it was brought up for us very quickly.   The staff at this resort are super friendly and make this hotel extra special. 

It was nice to have the room ready early upon our arrival and we has a spectacular view from the room on the tale end of the trip.  There are fireworks every Friday at 8pm which you might be able to view from your balcony, but we were out to dinner at the time of the display.   The rooms have a washer and dryer available and they provide soap and dryer sheets for your use.  

The beach is a short 4 minute walk and they provide beach towels for your use.    We dined at the resort for breakfast and also ate at the BLT steakhouse on the last night there.  Both were good. There are plenty of shops and restaurants in a short walk from the hotel which was convenient.  

The beds were very comfortable and the kitchen was well equipped for our stay.  In the first room we had a bathtub/shower combo but in the second we had an open area shower next to the tub.    The bidet toilet was an extra plus for the hotel.  

Would definitely return to this hotel.","Date of stay: September 2022","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Spoiled by the Trump chain of hotels!!","Q: Where can you find a room that will sleep 5 people, in a convenient part of Waikiki, is rated #1 on Tripadvisor for the best hotel in Waikiki, with 5-star service, ocean view w/ dual balconies and a separate room for the in-laws? How about free valet parking, no resort fees, early 12 PM check in and late 6 PM check out for Kama'aina (locals)?

A: You're looking at it!

It was difficult to fit all of these criteria into our budget and what we were looking for. It was either book two separate rooms and pay more, or stay here. Although the Trump line is not associated with budget, compared to booking separate rooms WITHOUT all of the perks above, it would have come out way more expensive. This was actually a deal, believe it or not.

DETAILS:

POOL: You're wondering why I'm writing about the pool first; it's because it seems to be one of the complaints of guests calling it small, and I have no idea why this is a problem. It is the most luxurious pool I've ever soaked in, and small and classy is better than big and brassy! Looking out over the infinity edge, I can see two other hotel's pools and they are a LOT larger but filled with rowdy drunk people and inflatables. Would you rather have a classy pool, or a larger pool in a less fancy setting? I soaked in the pool in the day, and at night (simply magical)! If you get cold, there's a separate jacuzzi. There's poolside cocktail and food service but I didn't use those. Next time I stay here, I'll try to time it with the full moon so I can soak under the moonbeams.

ROOM: Mind blown! We had a suite with one full bedroom, a den and living room, both with pull-out beds, 1120 sq ft, ocean view w/ 2 balconies, 2 full bathrooms, a fully-stocked kitchen (dishes, high-end bar glasses, utensils, knives, 12 cup coffee maker, full sized rice cooker!, wine chiller, pots/pans), microwave, fridge, dishwasher, ovens (Subzero, Wolf, Bosch, Miele). The bathrooms had really nice toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, bar soap, bath gel, bath salts, loofah, cotton swabs, make up pads, hair tie and shower cap, nail files).

The room decor all tastefully done in creams, dark and light wood tones, very clean as well. The trashcans were even made of leather! Impressive! The hotel gave you complimentary hotel slippers you could walk around in, as well as Eco water bottles; heavy bath robes for each guest, tons of fluffy clean towels and twice daily housekeeping. Very quiet, we didn't hear a thing but we also got a room on the side of the elevators separated from other rooms. Four elevators, the fastest elevators we've ever been in...totally insane!

SERVICE: Minds blown again!! This is 5-star service on steroids. I have never heard, in my life of frequenting hotels all across the globe, someone actually SMILING over the phone!! Keiko and Ryuko cheerfully greeted me daily when I called to ask for bottled water (complimentary) or had questions. Housekeeping personnel actually smiling and greeting us warmly was also surprising. Front desk check in and check out, all wonderful! Valet, also great!
Twice daily housekeeping, amazing!!

FOOD: Breakfast at the In-Yo Cafe was not very impressive. It was pricey so the next day we walked over to Duke's Waikiki for buffet breakfast (read my reviews for both). Eggs and Things around the corner but too many people. Dinner at BLT Steakhouse burned a hole into our 401K but my husband said it was the best steak ever (see my review on this one as well). The in-room dining menu seemed impressive, but we didn't use it. You can also walk about 2 short blocks to ABC Stores to get cheap wine and food, and Dole Whip! Giovanni Pastrami is also in the short walk away for take-out food and pizza (we loved the pizza).

CONVENIENT: ABC Stores, restaurants, boutique shops, Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center, International Marketplace all within walking distance. The beach is right across the street, as is the Army Museum, if you're into history.
Drop into Lewer's Lounge at the Halekulani for cocktails/piano music in the evening, but dress nice for that. If you want to drive over to Ala Moana Shopping Center for all-day shopping, it's about a 5 minute drive away.

OTHER: if you're a bird watcher, you're in for a treat if you have a room with the ocean view balcony. Swarms of white tern and Indian Ringneck Parakeets fly in flocks over the trees below and mingle with the pigeons and the lone chicken pecking for food in the grass by the Army Museum.

You can bring your dog with you for $50 more a night, now how many hotels let you do that? Need a crib for your kid? No problem!

If walking to other restaurants, I suggest walking along the beach-side and avoid walking around the hotel on the Ewa (west) side; it wasn't as nice and there was a creepy man checking us out.

PRICE: Your mileage may vary. We locked in at $666 a night (not joking) for local Kama'aina rate and now the rate is $987 for the same room.  

RETURN FACTOR: 120% YES.","Date of stay: May 2022","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We paid over $1000 a night for 16 nights in a 2 bdrm ocean view suite, incl an extra night just so we could check in early. We chose Trump because we wanted a kitchen and laundry this time with our little boy. 

Unfortunately despite the hotel clearly not being full we got stuck with a room on the north east side with at best a partial ocean view. The lanai was too windy and too noisy to enjoy (traffic noise and a nearby roof fan was squealing away like a stuck pig). At check in they tried to upsell us nicer views, south and west facing suites that were premium ocean view only though when we checked out we mentioned this and said we weren’t happy so our resort fee was credited back. So that was good. 

The suite itself was mostly fine. Clean and tidy and well equipped. 

There were various minor maintenance issues with the suite but because we were isolating and didn’t want anyone else in the suite we didn’t say anything until check out but I’m sure it would have been fixed if we’d asked. 

Wi-fi is VERY slow.

We had groceries delivered twice but one time no-one bothered to call our room to tell us they’d arrived so they sat in the heat for 20 mins until by sheer luck I checked my emails and saw one from the store confirming delivery. 

The accounts staff have no idea how to do a hold, they billed us for the entire stay before we arrived, then reversed it, then mucked up the hold again by not putting the right amount on. Then randomly charged us $12k days before we had even checked out. Again this was addressed by crediting the resort fee.

All in all it was a mixed experience and while we weren’t unhappy and our own preferences made it difficult for them to rectify things, I’m not sure that their current ratings are really justified.","Date of stay: September 2022","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

Quiet, clean
Comfortable beds
Pleasant and helpful staff
Fancy toilet/bidet
Kitchenette 
We never saw housekeeping, but our room was always pristine when we came back later in the day. 
Short walk to restaurants and VERY high end shopping and the beach. 

Cons:
Trump name. Honestly, it seemed so quiet and I don’t know how many people were there, so I wondered if the name affects occupancy. We chose the hotel for the reviews, not the name. 
No balcony on regular rooms ( and by regular I mean an ocean view king suite, so not a bargain room by any measure)
Bathtub very hard to get into if you have long legs. There is a piece of glass that covers half the area.  (At least in our room) A nice shower would’ve better, imo.
Not much of a Hawaii feel except in the welcoming spirit, florals, etc.  
not a resort that says “you’re in Hawaii”
Ocean view means you can see the ocean from the room over buildings.
Only ate one meal at the In-Yo cafe - breakfast. It was good and service was excellent. 
Some areas nearby seem a little sketchy and unlit at night, especially on Saratoga just past the hotel. 

If you want quiet, clean and comfortable, away from the crowds of the beach resorts, it’s a good choice.","Date of stay: September 2022","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Rare to find in Waikiki. Super kids friendly!","I have been staying multiple hotels in Waikiki(primarily Royal Hawaiian). Now I have a newborn and I suddenly realize how it restricts my selection now.
The room we stayed is Premium one-bedroom plus Den. The layout really varies but the amendities are the same. The room can easy accomodate 6 adults with the 1 queenbed + 2 sofabeds

The REASONS of choosing Trump Waikiki over the others
- Top tier services provided and Staff are extremely friendly and helpful. Only Ritz and Trump are in this category. Below the resorts but while above all other hotels. 
- Prepared and experienced in helping family with kids.  
   	a.UPPAbaby Minu stroller is provided by the hotel for daily use. I wish I knew it earlier so I didn't need to carry mine. 
      b.A big quality crib provided in room. 
      c.A kids friendly swimming pool. Slim and shallow. No alcohol served by the pool. 
      d.Hotel feels safe and secured by access control. We realized we left something in the swiming pool two days ago and staff done a great job in storage them for someone to claim.
- The washer and dryer in unit are bosch 800 series. Pretty clean and new. And we use them everyday. 
- Our flight departed at 9:30PM. They kindly offered a late checkout after 7pm. 
- Humidity indoor is well controlled. 
- When talking about the full kitchen, they really mean it. You can find Subzero fridge, subzero wine celler, rice cooker, induction stove, double oven, dishwasher, blender.etc almost everything you need. 

Based on the great experience I had this time, I would probably only stay with Trump when visiting Waikiki for family trip.","Date of stay: September 2022","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The room was clean and the staff, for the most part, was friendly enough but the general location of the hotel (I.e. not beach front) and the poor amenities and facilities offered by the hotel did not justify the price for the hotel. Although my 6 night stay included 2 free nights and a room upgrade (through my Amex card), the price still remains high for what we are getting. To be more specific, the size of the pool (despite what is pictured in the advertisements through clever photos) is smaller than most hotels in Waikiki. The gym is also sub-par and the “buffet” breakfast is one of the worst I’ve tried in Waikiki. It was not the best experience for us.","Date of stay: September 2022","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

Doting on your every move . bLT restaurant great! They upgraded us because of Amex platinum to a suite with a washer dryer
That comes in very handy for 3 weeks! Now I think every hotel needs one !

With Amex platinum , you also get free breakfast for two (awesome hot and cold breakfast with 1/2 buffet ) 

Within 5 minutes of Royal Hawaii  and Sheraton boardwalks 

Pool is small infinity pool overlooking city 
Lots of kids by 12/1 

Gym is small but lots of high end equipment and free water bottles

Much classier than Sheraton 

Sheraton: bigger /louder . More Kids /families 
Suites are smaller
The pool is first come first served! Unless you book on a separate website for your 60$-300$ covered chaise or lounger . You cannot get one unless you booked a couple weeks  in advance

They also watch your seat at the pool
You cannot be gone more than 1 hour or they give your chair to someone else !!! 

Stressful a bit

No swim up bar

Lots of average places to eat 
Small beach with 75$ umbrella  service

3-3.5 star at best 

Great hotel with kids -they share a kid pool with royal Hawaiin

Shops are across valet

Middle of shopping district

Sarah from  concierge was so helpful , Aaron from valet/bell, Roxanne, Conner and Camille from the restaurants just to name a few made our stay special.  My young child loved having a kids robe and slippers and special welcome gift.  The infinity pool was nice and relaxing though small.  I loved the fact that they had fitted towel covers for the lounge chairs instead of having to just lay towels over them.  We wish we could have stayed longer!  The breakfast was delicious- my whole family loved it and we loved the sushi at Wa'olu.  I would definitely recommend this as a great place to stay. If I ever go back to hawaii would definitely want to say here again!","Date of stay: June 2022","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

In our room my mother, my two children, and I stayed. Overall the stay was good. Location was convenient, service was good for the most part, and the pool was a bit narrow but clean and refreshing after a day out. Breakfast by the pool was lovely. 
Unfortunately, on the first day the room was cleaned, my favorite apparel disappeared. We keep our room organized and there are no articles of clothing that randomly get tossed in the wrong spot. In fact, I had placed it on top of the dresser before heading out for the day, as I intended on wearing it upon return. Still, we looked everywhere, just in case. But the room does not have many places where something could hide -- the bed doesn't have legs but rather a solid wooden base, and there is literally nowhere in the room for anything to hide. It was clearly missing. That was the only item that disappeared, from the top of the dresser, too. I ended up borrowing something from my mother to wear. This left a very sour taste in my mouth, and we ended up not getting the room cleaned for the rest of our stay. I did not want to risk anything else going missing. I wasn't able to wear my favorite apparel for the rest of the trip, and it was very inconvenient. It was very upsetting. I wish this never happened at such a highly rated hotel. For this reason, I don't think I will return.","Date of stay: June 2022","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_10"

When we arrived we were given a room on the 14th or 15th floor facing East-ish.  It was a little older, kind of musty and a little messy - certainly not what one would expect of a five star hotel so we called down to the front desk who informed us they would send someone up to take a look, clean it up, etc. As soon as they stepped into the room and saw what were describing was true the front desk promptly informed us they could move us to another room, it would only be a few hours.  With the wife a little aggravated I convinced her to switch rooms and are we glad we did.  As with all hotels of this size, they are constantly renovating rooms and the first one we were given just needs to be cycled through/updated.  Once this was behind we absolutely loved the second room.  It was ocean-view, with a big balcony and living room area.  Super clean and super nice (Im picky, so trust me, it was good).  In addition to great accommodations, the service was second to none, we were always greeted by name, the valet was prompt and no one ever seemed bothered to be asked a question or to help.  Pool was a little small but very cool and relaxing - we spent the majority of our daylight time at beach.

The last time I went I didn’t have that great a time mainly because I choose a mediocre hotel. What a difference I had this time in terms of enjoyment. The Trump Waikiki lives up to its high ratings. Every single associate treated me so well whether I had breakfast at the In-Yo Cafe, when I ordered a drink at the pool or had dinner at Wai’Ola Ocean Cuisine.

The ocean view room I had on the 12th floor had a huge bathroom, luxurious bed and a spacious living area. I loved going out onto the balcony to enjoy the picturesque view. The entire room experience was luxurious. Housekeeping did an amazing job replenishing everything and getting everything clean when I would come back later in the day.

I was a little apprehensive about the location, but it is so close to the beach, shopping and action that walking was never inconvenient. The hotel is very quiet at night given that there is a buffer of space between it and the other major Waikiki resorts.

In the future, I would like to see management bring back their breakfast buffet that I saw in a past YouTube video. I enjoyed the American breakfast at the In-Yo Cafe, but I would prefer the greater variety that is offered in a buffet, even if the cost is higher. I actually ventured to the Halekulani one morning to enjoy the House Without a Key’s breakfast buffet and really enjoyed it there.","Date of stay: April 2022","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The location was great as it was only a block to the beach and you can easily walk to many restaurants and shops nearby. The valet parking was very convenient to use. It was great that the concierge provided towels for a beach day on your way out.

If you want to be treated at the 'Best in Class' level, then stay here.   They do everything better than hotels generally associated with Great 6 star service.  We've stayed at Sharngri-La hotels in Singapore, Bangkok & Hong Kong , Intercontinental and Ritz Carelton in Hong Kong, and Four Season on Maui ... and the Trump just does everything a little better,  These are all great hotels, but the Trump richly deserves the 
""best in class"" description.  The people and service attitude of the Staff in Waikiki was just so exemplary.  The Food at the In-Yo Cafe was awesome every day ... we really didn't require to go out for breakfast ( or didn't miss it ).  Our 2 bedroom suite had Sweeping views of Waikiki that was just breathtaking .. and we were a 5 minute walk to a quiet beach.   At the end of the day, we could not wait to return to our suite to have dessert or a drink from our Lanai overlooking Waikiki.  I generally associate great service with many of the Asian hotels in Bangkok and Hong Kong, but at the Trump Waikiki , you are treated with a personal greeting (addressed properly by name, they keep your car close by if they know your going to be only a short stay.  They provide quick advice on travel and several time have literally saved us from exhausting traffic.  The best is that in the Housekeeping and concierge, they take off their Shoes always when entering your suite.  its a small detail, but nobody does this ....  Not going to lie, its expensive , but considering our experience ... worth it.","Date of stay: March 2022","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I believe that you always get what you pay for, but this hotel out-serviced all of the hotels I've been to.  

Service is definitely first class.  

From the valet guys to the front desk clerk to the maid to the restaurant staff, this hotel can't beat anyone.  Not super-imposing, always available when needed, and wants people to be comfortable at all times.  

The value is even way worth it.  I booked this hotel since we got a 'stay for 3 nights, get the 3rd night free' promo.  Our hotel room has a decent view of the ocean, and it overlooks the other buildings and their pools.

The pool area is nice.  It's infinity-style, and there's enough partition's to keep some privacy from other guests.  We stayed and hung out during early November 2021, and there's very little guests around the pool.  

There's ample in-room dining option, we've eaten around the pool, and we also ate with our day guests in the seating area on the way to the pool.  The view is magnificent - - ocean view and the Fort DeRussy grounds.  But nothing tops the view from the pool area during sunset.  We of course, have amazing views from our hotel room as well, morning, noon and night.  

Food options outside is aplenty.  Shopping as well.  We probably frequented at a local dining/bar area around the corner for some pizza and music, and then had a happy hour one night at the beachfront bar named Rum Fire at the Sheraton.  This is still during COVID, so some of the pool areas of the Rum Fire (a favored bar spot I've been to years ago) was not available, but we still enjoyed some view and live music coming out from around the corner.  

The bathtub on our room is one of the best we've ever had.  The toiletries are so beautiful and such a collector's item IMO.  

Note that this is not a beach front hotel, but the public beach access is just across the street.  Beachfront access hotels in Waikiki are a premium, and you get a matchbox-sized room in exchange for that privilege.  If you're okay with walking across the street for your beach time, do yourself a favor and book this hotel.  

It's also a suite, which means we have a normal sized fridge, dishes, etc.  It was super convenient.  And of course, I enjoyed drinking a glass of wine in my ocean-view balcony with my trump slippers and my robe, and my free chocolate bar.

I can go on but one thing you'll always feel when you walk away from this hotel; superb customer service.  All other hotels can claim good customer service.  This one delivers and more.","Date of stay: November 2021","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We were treated like royalty from the moment our valet opened our car doors until our final departure.  We truly enjoyed our deluxe room with a partial ocean view and lanai. The full kitchen was a bonus which we made good use of for preparing Max's meals.  The hotel is adjacent to the walking paths at Fort DeRussy which we enjoyed for our morning and evening strolls with Max.  There are lots of restaurants/cafes within walking distance.  The Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center and the Inernational Marketplace is a short walk from the Hotel.  In my opinion, the Trump International Hotel Waikiki Hotel is on the quieter end of Waikiki.

So we were very pleasantly surprised when we stayed here. The staff is incredible. Very pleasant and accommodating. Its location is also fantastic. 1 block from the beach and a short walk to Ala Moana Mall. It’s also on the quieter side of Waikiki. I know the name might throw some people off.

This place was amazing!  We had a two bedroom suite with full kitchen nice built in fridge and dishwasher too.  When we first walked in the place was immaculate, and a lot larger then we had thought it would be, floor to ceiling views of the beach and Ocean were a huge plus!  There were some areas in the suite that could use some updating, the lighting in the bathroom was the best I had ever had at a hotel, great hot water pressure too.  The pool was nice and private, but really a small area for a hotel of this size.  Walking to beach was easy, and they had towels for you to take downstairs.  They offered free late check out which was truly appreciated.  I did wish that there was a lobby bar, or a place out by the pool that you could walk up and order drinks.  The service at the pool was good though.  The gym was full equipped and I was able to use it each day.  All in all this place was truly a great place to stay in Waikiki.","Date of stay: February 2022","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

If doing it over again I would take advantage of their stay two nights and the third night is free special.  The Trump Hotel is 1/2 a block off the main strip but on a direct road right to Waikiki Beach so one is able to avoid the mobs of tourists wandering around and all their noise and also have direct access to the beach.  The area is very secure as it borders the US military resort hotel.  The breakfast/lunch restaurant by the pool was fantastic but the dinner restaurant left something to be desired due to the price and small portions.   My only complaint is that we went there with a gift card and the hotel personnel had a lot of difficulty using it and they spent an inordinate amount of time trying to apply the funds.  Do not let the Trump name scare you away.  This hotel employs locals and everything goes back into the local economy.

Booked via Amex Travel through the centurion /platinum program so was awarded $60 breakfast per day, $100 onsite credit for food or spa, and automatic late check out. No upgrades, since this was the highest ranking booked room (according to the front desk)
Traveling with a family of 7 (toddler that is 16 months) Trump made it easy.
They prepped the room with baby bumpers, provided Uppa Baby stroller, humidifier, diaper trash bin, baby monitor, and more. 

Rooms were spacious and clean

View was amazing, they placed us on the 30th floor.

Valet team- everyone was generally nice and courteous. Dean was a standout, great service and super easy to talk with. 

Concierge team was outstanding!

Reasons for missing 5 stars:
1. Appliances in kitchen were outdated. Water boiler showed signs of rusting. The stove heated up quite slowly for a Wolf. The vent was extremely loud.

2. Uppababy stroller was a bonus..except we realized one piece had broken off, so we couldn’t adjust the back piece

3. In-yo cafe breakfast, you can’t call in your order and pick up or else you’ll be subject to the 18% service fee. One day I ordered at the cafe, and they didn’t charge the 18% fee for take out, the next day I tried to do the same, and they said they’re too busy for takeout, so call room service and then I can pick it up. This didn’t make sense since it’s all coming from the same kitchen. The third day, I called in the order because I figure I’ll pay the 18% to have it delivered, 30 mins pass, I call back and because I asked for it to be boxed up for take out, they assume I was going to pick it up.. so I did, and they still charged the 18%. I do not mind tipping or being charged the service charge, if there was actually a service provided. 

Overall I would come back to Trump.","Date of stay: February 2022","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

We also did a lot of walking and seeing different hotels and how well or unmaintained they were. Trump Hotel was definitely on the nicer side. Even though it’s seen better days it still was our better stay. Service is hands down the best. The areas for improvement would be keeping up with the times. Removing a DVD player from the room. Updating the cell phone charger set up by the bedsides, which is usually the first thing guests look for when they get to the room. The infinity pool area was nice but could use a replacement of the infinity windows they look a little dated when you look up close. Also better drink service by pool area I’m not saying they didn’t have someone their running drinks but there was no evident place to go if you want to order food or drink. You have to wait for service to come to you. I think the hotel all around was a little dated but still cleaned well even the flower arrangements were being updated by outside florist while we were leaving. Service definitely shined from check in to valet. We didn’t ask for much but we know the answer would be yes if we asked.

We also enjoyed the restaurants in walking distance near by and walking at night after dinner.  
We were a block from the beach and across the street from the U.S. Army Museum.  The museum was a former Gun Battery to protect the island from the early 1900s and was a great story lesson.

Our room category was ""Premium One-Bedroom Plus Den Prime Ocean View Suite.""  There were two balconies, one off the living room and one off the bedroom.  Both views were beautiful, unobstructed ocean views.  We noticed many of the hotels in Waikiki are right on top of each other (most of their ocean views are probably partially-obstructed, in my opinion), so it was nice that this hotel had a park on one side, with the views facing over the park to the ocean.  Great location, two thumbs up.  It's one block (across the street) from the beach, with the Fort DeRussey park beach right in front of you.  We went to this beach on the first day and never returned.  When you're in the ocean, the bottom is rocky along that entire part of the beach.  Not nice.  We walked one direction up to Hilton's beach, and it wasn't much better, ocean bottom still very rocky.  So the next day we went in the opposite direction to the beach in front of the Sheraton/Royal Hawaiian, and that stretch was perfect.  Soft sand on the beach, soft sand in the ocean, no seaweed, crystal clear water.  Just know that this stretch of beach can get very crowded, so we tended to stay on the edge closest to the Sheraton.  (To-go beach chairs and umbrellas are not provided by the front desk at Trump, like at most other Waikiki hotels, but beach towels are provided.)  Beach chairs can be rented on this stretch of the beach for an outrageous price, or you can just buy your own chairs from any nearby ABC store or the Longs Drugs/CVS nearby for like $25 each.  The walk from Trump hotel to this stretch of beach is like 5 minutes, no biggie.  The only thing I would recommend about Fort DeRussey beach is the Steak Shack food stand.  Many days we would get food to-go and eat it on the beach for lunch.  Two thumbs up for Steak Shack, and their price are right too.  Even though these things are not directly related to Trump Waikiki, I read many reviews before booking this hotel and didn't see any of this information.  It would have been nice to know ahead of time that Fort DeRussey's beach has a rocky ocean bottom and that Hilton's beach bottom isn't much better, so to walk in the opposite direction towards the Sheraton/Royal Hawaiian stretch.  Hope that helps.

Now back to the actual hotel.  Housekeeping gets two thumbs up.  Lots of towels replenished daily, bath products too, and they even ran the dishwasher for us if they noticed any dirty dishes.  Water bottles (mini ones) were also replenished daily, and they will give you more if you ask for them.  These hardworking housekeeping folks definitely deserve your generous tips.  The hotel was spotlessly clean and it just felt like a super comfortable apartment with everything we needed.  The master bathroom was beautiful and modern, and the tub was just the right size.  Not too wide or too long that you feel like you were drowning, lol.  My husband also enjoyed the bidet.  

All staff at the front desk were incredibly nice, warm, and welcoming, in particular all the ladies we encountered.  One lady I spoke to a couple times happened to be a manager, and she was exceptional.  The gentlemen were all very nice too, but the ladies in particular were exceptional.  Wish I could remember their names, but this review is coming a little late.  All interaction with staff was above and beyond.     

Now that I have lavished this hotel with praise, it's time for your medicine.  I hope management or whoever makes these decisions will take this next part VERY seriously, because it WILL influence whether or not we return to this hotel again.  As I mentioned before, we stayed for 2 weeks in a ""Premium One-Bedroom Plus Den Prime Ocean View Suite.""  Check Trump's prices online and you will see how costly their suites are.  Without a doubt, if you book ANY SUITE, breakfast SHOULD be included in your basic room rate, not at an additional charge.  It should have absolutely been included to incentivize booking this costly room category for a 2-week stay.  We went to breakfast 2 or 3 times at Yolo, and the prices there were outrageous.  $37 per person for the Ohana breakfast, so with two people plus tip you're looking at almost $90..... for breakfast, people!  And the Ohana breakfast was actually the best bang for your buck, when you consider the other prices on the menu.  And coffee from the machine (lattes, etc) is an additional charge not included in the Ohana breakfast price.  We felt really nickel-and-dimed by that.  Why isn't breakfast included with this suite, or at least a breakfast credit for 2 people?  Believe me, many more people would book suites if they saw breakfast was included in the base rate!  What are you loosing by including it?  Absolutely nothing if someone is staying in a suite for 2 weeks!  In our extensive travels it has been our experience that when you book a higher room category (like a suite) at a 5-star hotel for a lengthy stay that basic perks are included, like breakfast at a minimum.  We would absolutely return to Trump Waikiki if this policy was changed for their suites.  We would not return if it wasn't changed.  That simple.  There are many other hotels (which I won't mention here) that are similarly placed 1 block across the street from Waikiki beach that cost much less (for their more expensive room categories) with breakfast automatically included in their room rate.  So if you're staying in Waikiki for a week, or any extended period of time, and this is important to you, then shop around.  Plenty of fish in the sea.....  On top of that, during our stay we noticed that Yolo was completely empty each time we went there, besides people at literally one or two other tables.  The restaurant is quite large and was almost empty.  Each time there were more servers than guests.  Even the coffee machine in the corner on the left looked like it hadn't been used in ages (I don't mean old, I mean un-used).  So what harm would it do to include breakfast in the room rate for people with suites?

That being said, we may return to Waikiki in 2022 and would absolutely stay at Trump Waikiki again if the suites had breakfast included in the lowest rate (or at least a decent $60 breakfast credit for 2 people), without having to book it at an additional charge on the website.  

Happy travels, folks!","Date of stay: October 2021","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

There is not a better location in Waikiki. The facilities are the most Hawaiian and best quality at a very strong value proposition. The staff at the Trump stands out the most. They are exceptional! Most of your needs are anticipated and every interaction is friendly, enthusiastic and caring. Can not recommend more highly. One expert tip is to ask for a room on the Fort Derussy side as it is significantly better than the city facing ones ( no AC drone).","Date of stay: November 2021","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Personalized, thoughtful service, the most immaculate housekeeping on a daily basis, and your utmost comfort and safety always at top of mind from staff. We really have no complaints about this place. 

We had written in our reservation notes that we were celebrating our anniversary, and a nice card with a chilled bottle of champagne with 2 flutes awaited us in our room when we checked in. They knew we had our young daughter with us, and 2 stuffed dolphins were sitting on the bed, much to her delight. After just one day, the staff all knew and remembered us by name - we felt like VIPs here (even though we most certainly are not). There are water filling stations everywhere, so you don't need to buy water if you don't want to - they even provide canteens for you. Such a great idea!

My only suggestion is to perhaps add a stop and go cafe where guests can pick up bakery and coffee items in the morning on the go. That would be so convenient! Oh, and something else to bear in mind - the pool is very small, and nothing to write home about - this may be important to you if you have young kids. Other than that - perfection. And I see it's been mentioned before, but the MAI TAIs are the best here - and I've tried mai tais from just about everywhere. They are so, so good!","Date of stay: August 2021","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

It was very spacious and clean.  They had the bed made up in the den for us.  I loved having a full kitchen (there was a blender , toaster, and rice cooker!) and washer/dryer (they provided detergent and bounce dryer sheets) in our condo.  We only went to the Waikiki beach one time.  It was a short 5 minute walk however the beach is small and the sand has a lot of small rocks/pebbles.  We rented a car and drove to the North Shore and East part of the island which I thought was much prettier and fun.  I liked the location of our hotel for accessibility to restaurants and shops.  The staff was awesome and had great customer service.  Every time I called down to request an item (extra pillows, laundry detergent, soap, etc) they brought the items up promptly and with a smile.  The valet service was also quick.  Often they would offer us cold bottled water.  If they forgot to offer it, I would ask and they would get it for my quickly.  They also have a big stack of beach towels at our disposal with reuse-able bags to put your beach things in.  The concierge was also helpful and had lots of ideas for us.  The swimming pool and hot tub were ok.  They weren't as large as I would have liked but every time I went to use it, it wasn't too crowded.  The gym was pretty good.  Our son went to work out almost everyday of our trip.  Overall, I would recommend this hotel and look forward to the next time I can stay at the property.","Date of stay: November 2021","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Needless to say, we made the best choice of all the hotel options available in Waikiki.  From pre-arrival to final check-out we felt like family because of the fine professionals that we came into contact with.  During pre-arrival we would like to thank Carol and Lisa for helping us select the proper suite and arrange for the best package possible for our stay.  Thanks again Carol and Lisa for your personal touches with arrangements.  Next, we want to thank Tim and Zen for an incredible check-in and check-out experience.  Your professional, courteous, and personable service was over the top!  Thanks again.  As for our 6 night stay we had the honor to work with folks like Keith who provided us outstanding service during our first night dining experience in Wai-Olu.  Keith helped us kick off our 49th Wedding Anniversary celebration.  Great job Keith!  Then there was Ryan!  What can we say other than Ryan seem to be the one person who does it all from providing outstanding pool service to being up bright and early each morning to service us for breakfast in the In Yo Restaurant.  Ryan, you are a true example for others to follow and we know the Trump Hotel Waikiki must be very proud that you are part of their team.  Finally, Briana always greeted us with a friendly and personal smile each morning when we arrive for breakfast in the In Yo Restaurant.  Briana, you are definitely a bright and shiny star who is a true ambassador for the Trump Hotel Waikiki,  Thanks again for your impeccably professional customer service.  Overall, as you can see from the above comments that outstanding customer service is the true bench mark for a great hotel.  This was definitely the case during our stay.  The hotel itself is well maintained along with having outstanding restaurants for their guest to choose from.  Our one bedroom suite with den was just perfect allowing us some of the must beautiful views of Waikiki Beach and some wonderful breathtaking sunsets and rainbows everyday.  In short, there were no shortfalls with this Forbes 5 Star hotel.  It's definitely the best bang for the buck in Waikiki and we are glad to have been part of the Trump Hotel Family for 5 glorious nights!  Thanks again to the entire staff for a job well done.  We will be back soon.  Lee and Shelley Tompkins","Date of stay: August 2021","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Premium One-Bedroom plus Den Prime Ocean View Suite.  Perfect for our family of 4. Ultra clean room with carpets having been shampooed before each arrival.  Service was first rate pre-arrival from everyone at concierge desk, at checkin, and throughout our stay including at the pool which our kids surprisingly loved given its relatively small size.  Kepa was responsible for pool food and drinks when we were there, has been there 4 years as i recall he said, and no surprise is a credit to the property.  Just about everyone I talked to had worked there a while.  I am not a fan of Trump politics but after this stay am definitely a fan of Trump hotels.  Especially given staffing challenges in Hawaii particularly this summer (we experienced them at the Montage at Kapalua the prior week), our expectations were hugely exceeded.  Food was excellent.

Central to everywhere but this also means that the problems of an urban location such as Waikiki are never too far away.

I am glad to be back here! My family and I genuinely enjoyed our stay (and visit to Oahu)!

As always, the wonderful team made our stay extremely enjoyable. They obliged to my advance request for a late check out (had a evening redeye flight back home), and didn't even flinch when we unexpectedly arrived early (flight schedule change) to check in. Likewise, it was great to experience the usual Ohana attitude from all the team members. I was ecstatic to run into Hisashi (front desk, previously door man) who brought our luggage to our room after check-in. He and I looked at each other, and after a pause, he broke the ice and said, ""you look familiar!"" We had our energetic greeting and spent some time reconnecting since our last interaction (2017). I love that!! Sadly, this was our one and only encounter with Hisashi for the duration of our stay (presumably since he was busy). Won't lie, I tried to look for my ""brotha""!

We also made new friends as well! Dean (door man?) was always VERY friendly and helpful giving tips. He gave us pointers on where to stay/park in the North Shore, and had driving recs when we lamented how it took us almost 2 hours to drive back from Makapu'u Beach (due to water main leak that shut down lanes). We also met Keanu and another evening valet member (who I sadly didn't catch his name) who were equally awesome and exuded ohana spirit to everyone, including my rambunctious son :). [Akiko, please message me for more details regarding the evening shift valet team] 

While we had a lovely stay, I am disappointed to learn (among other cuts) that the guest ambassadors are unavailable.  My family miss the lei greeting and their interactions in the ground floor! Back in 2017, Julia (ambassador) treated my daughter like a Queen! (Note to Akiko/management: PLEASE bring back the ambassador team and full valet staff). 

I am pleased and blessed to have stayed at this location again. My family and I look forward to visiting again (hopefully soon) when we decide to visit another island and use Oahu as home base. :)","Date of stay: August 2021","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Unbelievable cleanliness, amenities (I mean, wine cooler in kitchenette?) genuinely friendly, detail oriented staff, impeccable housekeeping which saw to every request!! Trump should have stuck to building brilliant hotels — everyone would’ve loved him:)) But seriously, location was exclusive, entrance was oddly unimpressive but our Suite was crazy impressive — we loved that imbalance! Let me not forget, the 6th floor hotel staff allowed us a 7:30PM checkout since we were catching a red eye — I mean, that’s like a free day!! See why we loved this hotel? I think we did catch the final week (May 16-23, 2021) before the hordes descend from pent up demand but you won’t regret staying here. Oh, and my poolside drinks were nice and strong! This is easily a 6-7 star hotel rated as a 4/5 depending on the booking site. Can’t recommend it enough — we had very high expectations (celebrating our 2019 (25th) wedding anniversary, my remission from 2019 cancer, my husband who’s a physician (2020’s Covid19)...even our politically left daughters loved this place and easily rate it their favorite!","Date of stay: May 2021","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Unfortunately, our experience failed to meet the same level of excellence as that of our previous visit, and was subpar. What sets a luxury resort (we've also stayed at the Ritz Waikiki & the Four Seasons Ko Olina) apart from another resort is the service provided, with the staff being genuinely warm and helpful.

The building corners a relatively quiet section of Waikiki but it is only one street away from the Kalakaua which is the highly active area, this made it like a perfect get away from the hustle and bustle while keeping us close enough to walk entertainment and restaurants.

It was a most unusual hotel experience.  I always feel as though most brands try to nickle and dime you.  Overpriced minibars, telephone and internet fees, parking, etc.  This room was a huge studio.  It had a full fitchen and no mini bar.  It felt as though the hotel made a conscious effort to encourage us to provide our own snacks and beverages if that is what we wished to do.  The main reason I will return is the flawless service.

Great for visitors AND local residents.","March and April 2021 Stay: 

We have stayed at the Trump twice in the last two months and we would highly recommend it to anyone heading to Waikiki!

We are residents of Hawaii, so we are very picky where we “staycation” when we head to Waikiki.  

Important things to us are:
Location:  We want to be close to beaches and top-notch restaurants:  The Trump is at the beginning part of Waikiki with easy access to the beach.  Amazing sunset views!  It is also located just blocks from some of the best restaurants and shopping in Waikiki. BLT Steakhouse is in the Trump and very very good!   You can literally take a short walk and get anything you need.  Once we park at The Trump, we don’t drive anywhere.  Walking is close and easy.

Parking:  We love that Trump has continued to have valet parking only. Most places in Waikiki stopped it because of Covid.  I love not having to circle circle circle up parking garages then hauling our stuff to and from each floor.  NOT the case at The Trump.  The valet crew, top notch!  I can’t say enough about how great those guys are and how easy and quick are car was always available.

Crowds:  We are not fans of large hotel chains with long lines and huge crowds.  The Trump is perfect.  Everyone will great you by your name and not once did we have to wait for anything.  Everyone, from Scott to Jay to Dean to EVERYONE else that works there are simply the best.

Room Size:  We tend not to stay in regular hotel rooms. We like to have a kitchen and living room area.  The Trump has many options from regular hotel rooms to 1-3 bedroom condos to the amazing Penthouse with its own hot tub and swimming pool.  Whatever your budget is, you can find something at The Trump.  I love that you can also bring your pet if you have one! 

Hawaii Residents:  If you live in Hawaii, The Trump has some amazing specials for local residents!  Make sure you ask about the specials.

If you are not from Hawaii:  Stay at The Trump!  If you have a family, you will love their suites and their personalized service. I even think the kids get a little gift upon arrival. So fun!

Once we checked in, anytime we needed something the staff were always there to help us out. 

I think we tried EVERY item on their room service menu.  We are very happy with everything we had and they were so quick!  We always had our food delivered within 20-30 minutes. 

Pool side food and bar service were also great.

Staying in a suite with a full kitchen also gave us more dishes and cleaning to do but NOT TO WORRY!  The housekeeping crew were amazing.  They did all dishes, towels, bedding.. everything. It was great.

We also liked the gym.  We understand hotels can have very small gyms with limited items. We love free weights and The Trump has a great selection of light to heavy free weights!  It was never crowded so you can get in and get your work out done easily and quickly!

We would highly recommend staying at this property and we certainly will return!","Date of stay: March 2021","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

COVID precautions felt fair but there were some small (and fair) differences to expectations from previous reviews.

-Beach towels available but no beach bag

The rooms needs to be refreshed. It is still the best in Honolulu, considering the competition is made of 1980's style properties.

The staff is extremely rude, in fact unbelievably rude. It is appalling. It is evident the this Trump property is running short of liquidity. Even the hot water is not working.

The prize for the rudest staff member goes to: Mr. Hiroshi Kanzaki (front Office manager - small m). He begs for the resort fee although there is no resort itself. He shares that even if most of the facilities are closed the Customer MUST help with the pool's up-keeping and the grass cutting.

I book the hotel using Amex FHR and get room-upgrade to a larger studio as well as a bottle of Champagne and some sweets.

I choose the hotel as it's newer comparing to some other hotels closer to the beach and it has a kitchen, which will be useful for making simple kid's meal.

The location is very good, close to beaches, shops and restaurants.

The only problem I have is the room's mattress is too soft for me at the beginning and cause my neck pain. But the hotel quickly replaces it with a firm mattress after I talk to front desk.

I chose this hotel because I trusted the Trump brand of hotels and the reviews were glowing.

It was a perfect setup for us.  The hotel graciously placed a complimentary bottle of champagne in the refrigerator upon our arrival in recognition of my wife's 40th birthday and our wedding anniversary. They also provided plush toys for the kids.  The pool on floor six was great.  Initially, it appears small, but it runs about 100 feet  - so it's quite sizable in square footage.  The location was really great - its next to a beautiful park and restaurants and shops are a block away.  The beach is also a short walk away.  The service was above my expectations - from the porter delivering our luggage, the room service and front desk folks were extremely kind and helpful.

If we had travel questions they helped with those also. I wish I knew the names of the omelet chefs, the omelets were delicious! We utilized the concierge department also. Yuki and everyone there were always ready to assist us. Yuki gave us maps and great ideas for places not to miss. We enjoyed a few happy hours and dinners in the Wai’olu restaurant and had great servers. The Pool & Fitness Center were always clean and staffed with great people as well. 
We had a partial-ocean view room. It is 500 sq. Feet. Very comfortable with a kitchen as well. The housekeeping staff is phenomenal. We just called each day when we were going out and our room was spotlessly cleaned right away. Bottled water is always stocked. We were celebrating our Anniversary, sparking wine and Honolulu cookies awaited us in our room also.

So a lot of amenities are a bit outdated. Some of the ocean view rooms are also blocked by other hotels. We lived on 21st floor at the corner closest to the ocean, but we can only see two hotel buildings in front of us, cant see all the coast and beaches. We’re also a bit disappointed at the very small infinity pool. Compared to many other hotels, the pool is way too small, and you can only see surrounding hotels from the pool. The breakfast buffet is also a bit lacking. We only have the basic things, and there aren’t as many choices. 
The good thing is the room service. The service is fantastic, and the front desk is very helpful. Room is cleaned many times a day, the staff is detailed-oriented (draw all the curtains for you, cover all the open cups, etc.), and all our questions and requests are addressed excellently.

It helped when we got a good deal through Hotwire's Mystery Hotel booking. They give you clues to guess the hotel and by taking a chance you can save big money. The whole experience was exceptional. For example, I've never before used valet parking, but did this time partly because parking is so expensive anywhere in Waikiki. Driving a new white convertible made it like a scene out of a movie. On check in we were asked if this was a special occasion. I answered no but it was my wife's birthday the previous week.To our surprise and delight after we got into the room there was a knock on the door and a staff member handed us a complimentary bottle of real French champagne. Not Dom Perignon or Moet Chandon but also it wasn't Cook's. (Our favourite inexpensive ABC Store bubbly). What a great start to our evening. Naturally, the room was superb. We had a great breakfast there the next morning. They provided a beach kit that included towels, bottled water and a bagged lunch. My wife enjoyed her award winning mai tai that evening. Everything about our stay was luxurious. We even had a large balcony with ocean view. If only we could afford to stay a week, never mind a month. Nonetheless, our two days were magnificent.","Date of stay: December 2019","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We were looking for a 5-star near the beach, and Trump didn't disappoint. We booked a 3 bedroom premium suite. It was amazing. Each one of us had a room, our own bathroom, and the views were breath-taking. Everyone on staff is so friendly, and they go out of their way to make sure your stay is excellent. Their buffet breakfast is the best I've ever had (especially their muffins). It's huge and there's something for everyone. They are about a block from the beach and they give you a beach bag with water, towels and fruit. Several people complained because it's not right on the beach, but you can be there in about 5 mins. There's really only one down-side, and that is  it's valet parking only so you have to wait for your car every time you leave. They do have one of the best valet rates per night of many hotels in Waikiki ($37/night). Also, the valet can be slow if they are busy, so just allow yourself plenty of time. Another down-side is you need to make sure you understand what room you are booking. Their description of the 3 bedroom suites doesn't tell you there are 2 possible floorplans. I happened to email them, and that's how I found out. One floor plan has 2.5 bathrooms and the other has 3.5 bathrooms. It depends on how much space you want or if you care about the floorplan. We wanted a specific floorplan and they were able to accommodate us. If there is anything you need during your stay, just ask and they will do the best they can to accommodate you. We are so glad we chose to stay here rather than the Ritz. If we come back to Honolulu we will definitely give Trump International another try.","Date of stay: December 2019","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The rooms are great and I would recommend one with an ocean view. If you go to the beach, they give you a beach bag that you rent free of charge and then return it after you are finished. The hotel is right down the street from the beach and is a short walk. They even have water bottles in the rooms that are free and can be restocked at any time.

The concierge team which included Gemma, Goro, Sarah and Mele were excellent and tended to all our requests.  They recommended and set up a great island island tour as well as para sailing.  Each and every restaurant recommendation was spot on and the meals were incredible.  

The breakfast buffet is one of the best and a great value not to be missed.  Sean was one of the servers in the main restaurant where we enjoyed lunch.  He was so extraordinary that I asked to speak to his manager, Rand, to inform him of the great service who showed great appreciation for the compliment.

Unfortunately, O'ahu recently passed an ordinance limiting the neighborhoods where short term rentals are allowed:  Waikīkī, Ko Olina (leeward side) and the North Shore.  The prices in Ko Olina are higher vs what I want to spend (more than $1 million), and North Shore is far.  So I focused my efforts on condotels in Waikīkī.  Trump was fairly new, and in my price range:  I gave it a test drive.

Pros:  Excellent customer service.  Brent checked us in and the bags were up to our room before we arrived (we stopped by to check out the gym);  Max 5 min walk to the beach; Good size room (500 sf) w/ large shower/tub space and dual sinks;  Kitchenette w/ two burner stove, small fridge & micro; Toto washlet to keep you fresh; Spa and fancy restaurant on site; Nice gym; Close to Ala Moana Mall, Foodland, Zippys, and the strip (Kalakāuā); Close to plenty of reasonably priced restaurants; Close to public transportation;

Cons:  Bed is too soft for my liking; Infinity pool is small, and so is the lounge area by the pool; Famed mai tais are okay.  I prefer the mai tais at the Moana or Royal better; No washer/dryer in room; The table next to the TV, and the dresser were pilau.  The maid didn't dust the furniture; At this price point I would expect mouthwash;

In summary, the pros far outweigh the cons.  I'm doing to math to see if a unit can generate sufficient cash flow for me.  Nonetheless, at $610/night (Nov), Trump is a very nice place to stay in luxury.","Date of stay: November 2019","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Upon arrival I was greeted with a beautiful Hawaiian Lei. Much appreciated it.

All staff was kind, cincere, always smiling, always willing to fulfilled all my requests. Very caring, no attitude. No rushing and sense of calm. 

I tried both restaurants at hotel and was extremely satisfied not just with the quality but also with the foods generosity, large portions, elegant and classy presentation. I also tried breakfast. Great variety of selections for all taste buds. 

Overall I was extremely satisfied about my stay, would definitely come back, hopefully in the near future. 

Thank you again Team Trump International Waikiki for making my two nights stay relaxing and feeling at home. Your hard work, dedication and professionalism is clearly visible.

Our first impression was the staff was so friendly and very kind.. They help us right away with our bags and assist us to the check in lobby.. We did not feel any awkwardness and it feels like the staffs are our one of our closest friend..

The staff that greets you on arrival was perfect.  The property is located in a great part of Waikiki (is there a bad part?).  It is one row back from the ocean/beach.  However, it is a really short walk to the DeRussy Beach Park which is nice and long.  We had a one bedroom suite with a full kitchen -which made for a comfortable apartment like stay more than a hotel room -- but many levels nicer than something like a Residence Inn.  The room was perfect.  The bathroom was probably the best bathroom I have seen in a hotel -- very large, 2 vanity sink, a standalone bathtub and a separate large open shower and then there is the full service toilet (the ones with the lighted bowl, heated seat and remote operated bidet and blow dryer.)  I know this seems minor, but the elevators travel faster than most -- which is a good thing because you really zip up and down quickly.  There is a nice infinity pool on the 6th floor -- its outside -- and its fairly small with limited seating -- so if a big pool with lots of lounge chairs is a must, then you might want to stay somewhere else.  Other than that it should be perfect for everyone.  The 6th Floor lounge area and restaurant are great with a great view too.  It also is a short walk to all the best shopping and restaurants at Waikiki.  I highly recommend this place.","Date of stay: August 2019","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We were a party of 12 traveling to Oahu for my in-laws 50th anniversary.  I was in charge of putting together the trip and did a lot of research on places to stay.  As with any time you are traveling - you truly do not know what to expect until you get there - what we experienced at the Trump Hotel was beyond anything I was expecting or could have imagined to have expected.  The staff from the bell service, front desk, concierge, to even the wait staff by the pool, restaurants, and cleaning staff were so amazingly professional, nice, and knowledgeable!  They knew us by name and were so genuine with their greetings, conversations, and willingness to assist.  We had an amazing experience and if you are trying to decide where to stay - I can say Trump International should be a place to consider.  It's worth every penny you are going to spend if you are looking to be pampered and treated like you are the only people there.

They were always pleasant and helpful while providing great service. The rooms were tidied twice daily with replenishment of thick bath towels and too-notch toiletries. The bathroom was beautifully appointed and conveniently laid out. The bedroom decor was just OK but the mattress and bedding were cloud-like. No gift shop other than a very small one tucked away near the spa. It carries very few items. No coffee shop.  No poolside restaurants. We found ourselves at other hotels a lot. Fortunately, the hotel is conveniently located near other hotels and walking distance to the shopping and entertainment area. The hotel is not on the beach.  There is a short walk to get there.  Very, very disappointing was the pool. It is minuscule. The pool area has only 6 chairs in the sun. No umbrellas. The other approx 30 chairs are all under a rooftop and basically on top of each other. It is difficult to come by an open one, let alone enough in a row for a family.

Even before arrival, the staff (concierge) was helpful with tips and accommodations (dinner reservations, spa reservation, parking/shuttle info, room request, etc.).  After arrival, every staff member was polite, friendly, and helpful -- each going out of his or her way to help with any need.

Room: Superb.  We requested an ocean-view room with lanai (deluxe ocean view room) and were upgraded to a suite.  The room was amazingly large, clean, and upscale -- more like a modern apartment than a hotel room.  The bed was very comfortable with many pillows, the bath rooms (two!) were nicely designed and roomy, the kitchen was HUGE with Wolf appliances and stocked with every ""gadget"" you would need, and the living area/TV were very comfortable & roomy.

Room Service: Prompt and Very Good.  We don't like ""plastic room machine coffee"", so we ordered coffee (a large pot) every day and enjoyed it on the lanai; it was delivered quickly and was very fresh / hot / tasty.  We ate breakfast in-room one day to eat on the lanai; we ordered eggs Benedict, and they were amazingly good.  The housekeeping staff made the room spotless during the afternoon, and they offered a turn-down service in the evening (fresh towels, arrange bed & lighting for when we came back from the evening out).

Location:  It's not on the waterfront, but only one building away, so a very easy & short walk through Ft. DeRussy park to the beach -- maybe 2 minutes?  The rooms on the west side have a nice view of the park, ocean, and skyline.  It's an easy walk to many restaurants and shops -- we walked around often after sunset and the area is active.

Grounds: Well-Kept and Upscale.  The gym, library, and reception area are well-kept and serene - very peaceful ambiance.  The pool is nice, and there were some children, but it was not a typical resort pool for kids (not a lot of shouting and water sports, but a more relaxed atmosphere).

Summary: Although it's more pricey than some locations, you will be rewarded for the extra cost.  The entire experience was memorable and comfortable -- a truly exceptional & peaceful hotel among many expensive ""tourist"" hotels along the beaches of Waikiki.","Date of stay: June 2019","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Your stay starts with valet and everyone in your family is greeted with leis.  Valet is always so friendly and helpful.  And I don't know how they memorize everyone's names (last name) during their stay but all of them always great you by name whenever you pass by.  That's pretty impressive.  I also think its pretty impressive that the staff has been pretty consistent every year.  It's nice to see familiar faces every year and that they remember you year to year.  Check in is always quick.  We've never had to wait for our room to be ready.  Bell hop is also very quick when bringing your luggage to your room.  In fact, while we were walking to our room, they were already there waiting outside the door!  What I love most about this hotel and maybe this just has to do with the service they provide loyal customers, however, every year we've stayed here, we've always received an upgraded room which is awesome!  Even in a non upgraded room, the rooms are huge and extremely comfortable.  Housekeeping is very thorough and our room was always immaculate with all toiletries refilled daily.  I love that this hotel is on the ""quieter"" end of the strip and even while hanging out on the lanai its not too noisy at all.  The hotel in general is not noisy.  Rarely will you hear your neighbors.

Again, I love staying at this hotel and the service they provide!  My youngest even told me the other day that its the only other ""home"" we're allowed to stay at when we're on vacation!  She's 4, LOL!","Date of stay: June 2019","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

After a hectic 18 day cruise, we checked into the Trump Waikiki and found:
Flawless service---all staff greeted us by name from the moment we checked in. Employees were very friendly, personable, and helpful.
Our hotel room was pristine and view (even though it was a city view) was marvelous. Any ammenities we could possibly need were available.
We tried all the restaurants on the property---although each was different, each was exceptional.  We especially liked the Hawaiian version of nachos as an afternnoon snack.
The hotel location is a couple of blocks away from all the noise of some of the more ""touristy""  places and we enjoyed the chance to get away from the crowded areas.  Even for a quick nap, we were able to sleep without interruption.
The doorman (Dean) was both funny and a fountain of knowledge about both Honolulu and Hawaii.  His suggestions were very helpful.

Welcome area was very busy when we arrived and I was surprised to have to queue to check-in. We were on the 36 floor, so good views but unfortunately South East side so very noisy despite high floor. The sound from the street and venues below seemed to be reflected against the walls of adjacent buildings straight into our bedroom. Being this side also meant no view of the fireworks. The apartment was well furnished and generally well equipped, but only a filter coffee machine (no Nespresso or plunger) and no Netflix in 2019? Really? The water is Honolulu tasted pretty flat and metallic, but even trying the filter coffee with bottled water was not able to address this issue. Charging US$22 including tax for a film on top of a room rate of over US$1000 is really gouging. Some additional penny pinching with no small sun tan lotion in beach bags. Pool remains too small for such a large hotel and tended to put us off using it. Room service food quality average.Gym moderate size but nothing had been changed or updated since we were last there and again was really in need of an update. Overall I though extremely expensive for what was currently on offer and would not stay again.","Date of stay: February 2019","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

From the minute we checked in (Jason was excellent) til the time we left we were very pleased with our stay.  I hired a car which I probably didn’t need to because Waikiki is walkabout but we did drive to North Shore and hiked Diamond head one day. The first morning my rental had a flat tire which the valet staff went and got filled but was very helpful with trying to help sort problem, the concierge ( forgot his name but he was awesome) even called to try to switch our car out in Waikiki which we couldn’t but they were amazing.  Breakfast Buffet was very good and staff very friendly.  Rooms were clean and housekeeping staff friendly and extremely attentive.  We got upgraded to a studio with kitchenette which was perfect.  Very spacious rooms with partial views of ocean and diamond head.  Only two negatives are the pools rather small and it’s not on the beach.

This is at the edge of the Hale Koa Hotel which means house of the Warriors the objective of all of the islands leaders who defended the islands at all walks of Hawaiian History since its existence since the mid 1700s when Capitan Cook settled on these islands.  

The Trump Hotel features five star dining in its primary ground floor grand dining room and on the sixth level overlook light meal dining.  These feature mainly lunch and dinner open to the general public and hotel guests with reservations suggested for dinner at the main ground floor restaurant.  There are also courtyards on the sixth level overlooking the ocean front activities and the general city skyline of very tall skyscrapers past the 50th floor.  The Trump hotel is at least to the 35th floor much higher than many of the Wakiki Hotels including Hilton Hawaiian eight Towers at present.  Trump hotel also features apartment rentals at very high rental rates due to its class of residence life which is high luxury style.

Based on the nightly rate (mid $400’s at the cheapest at the time of my stay) I expect a great deal more. Location left much to be desired- a block in from the ocean, despite them selling it as very close and getting in and out of the hotel is a nightmare. Room was on the small side and we found to be not very clean despite the price. Staff was friendly and great but you can tell policies are very cheap and meant to maximize profit over customer service/comfort. An example is the minimal replenishment of toiletries and the enforced policy of “Only registered guests are allowed in the guestrooms”, to which the staff seems required to uphold ridiculously (having several friends on island- this hotel made them, and us, feel very unwelcome. Also, the exorbitant additional rates for valet (listed as $37/day but charged more at checkout) and resort fee (which was difficult to find a rate for before being charged it on checkout). The policies are no doubt from the too and ruin the experience.

As an FYI, I'm a weekly business traveler with a lot of hotel time but have never stayed at a Trump hotel. With all row 1 hotel ocean views sold out when I booked, I started looking at Row 2 and am so thankful I did.  We received a wonderful greeting upon arrival with a necklace, a cold towel and watermelon water. The location was perfect.  It is a very close walk to the beach, 3-4 minutes. You can pick up a complimentary beach bag that has towels, water and fruit. Once on the beach, they have an arrangement with a beach vendor that allows you to charge to your room.  The room was fantastic. Comfortable beds and furniture, large balconies (we could see the beach fireworks), large tubs and separate showers, bidets, robes/slippers, washer/dryer and an amazing kitchen.  Housekeeping in is top notch.  My two favorite meals in Waikiki were both at the hotel. A late night dinner on the 6th floor Wai'Olu restaurant which was amazing.  It is an open air restaurant and at 9pm they had a happy hour with lower prices on most of the menu.  The city views, evening breeze and great food made it a favorite.  The service was exceptional. Also don't miss the breakfast buffet; another open air restaurant near the pool with fresh morning air and a great variety of multicultural breakfast options. The location is perfect. In addition to the easy beach access, walkability is perfect with restaurants and shopping just steps away. One close dining option that we really enjoyed was the Tommy Bahama restaurant.  We hated to leave and when we return, this is where we will always stay.

The premium two-bedroom prime ocean view suite was very nicely appointed with a gorgeous full kitchen.  We never used the kitchen, but the coffee maker worked very well!  Both rooms were furnished well and the beds were comfortable.  The ""master"" suite had an en-suite bath and the other room had an attached bathroom that also opened up near the kitchen.  The views were absolutely incredible!

Check-in and check-out both took over 30 minutes - but this is due to the personalized service provided to each customer.  It became a bit frustrating when a simple question needed to be asked to the front desk and you ended up waiting for 30+ minutes, but the fact that the service otherwise was so good that the wait was not a big issue.

Yes, the pool is (very) small but the pool service is swift and the drinks are strong.  There is no need for a large pool when the beach is a block away.  The overhang of the hotel makes tanning a bit difficult, but, again, the beach is a block away.

The location of the hotel is fantastic - with high end shopping a couple of blocks away and the beach one block away.  It's all walkable, which is an added bonus.

Overall, a pleasant stay in a high end hotel met the needs of the anniversary celebration.  Thank you, Trump Waikiki!","Date of stay: June 2018","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

It was a total fail on every one of our requirements and within 15 mins I was on the phone with the Trump hotel, having enjoyed the property in 2012.  We were fortunate to find a one bedroom partial ocean view on the 20th floor for $100 more a night than the disaster we had originally booked.  What a steal.  For that extra $100 a night we got a brand new looking one bedroom condo with fully equipped full size kitchen, full living/dining room, marble bath (tub and shower), balcony and washer/dryer with detergent and fabric sheets. We struggled for the entire week trying to figure out what a full ocean view that was different from our partial view, since we had 180 degree view of nothing but blue skies and ocean!

The staff are amazing and earn their tips.  The breakfast buffet was mediocre and the one thing that could afford a step up. This is a minor complaint as there are tons of other options in the area. 

I feel so lucky that the Trump had room for us at the last minute. Thanks for coming to our rescue and delivering top notch quality.  

Thanks for the veterans discount, too. Very much appreciated.","Date of stay: December 2018","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I am a lifetime platinum elite with Marriot.  We were booked at another hotel in the Marriott chain here in Waikiki. When I read about the Marriott strike, I decided to look for another option.  We decided on Trump as it offered the amenities we were look for.  Having said that we were honestly hesitant to stay at a Trump hotel for obvious political  reasons.  I can't begin to say how happy we are here.  The service is beyond 5 star. The staff is exceptional.  We gave up a nicer room at a Marriott hotel to stay here. The suites here are well equipped and lovely. Our check in experience after about 24 hours of traveling was excellent and better than anything I have ever experienced from a Marriot.....even Ritz Carlton, where I usually stay.  My husband wasn't feeling well at dinner in the restaurant and the staff went above and beyond to assist. Even the night Manager called to check in on him.  I truly never thought I would say this, but I am now hooked on this hotel and look forward to not only our return, but to trying out others in the chain.  To all my lifetime Platinum Elites reading this and not sure what to do because of the strike.....book this hotel.  I am giving up A LOT of Marriott points to stay here and it is worth it! The pic is a view from our suit.  It isn't oceanfront, as it is a block away from the beach, but I will trade that for the customer service!

But now I regret not staying at the Trump sooner. 

On the map, the Trump Hotel does not appear to be close to the beach, or offer good views, but in reality, the views are better than some of seaside hotels we have visited. The rooms on the park side which overlook the Army museum are quieter, and have a great ocean view. 

Checking in to the Trump Hotel was simplicity itself. The baggage handlers and front desk staff were remarkably friendly and efficient, a staff member was on hand to give us a quick tour of the hotel and it's facilities. We were given a comfortable place to sit, and drinks to enjoy as our room was prepared. 

We had booked our reservation with an early check in option, so our room was to be ready by 11am. As the room was not ready on time, we were upgraded to a suite with an ocean view. 

The room itself was quite amazing, the largest hotel room we have yet enjoyed on our Hawaiian visits. The suite had two bedrooms, a full kitchen, spacious tub, and two toilets. The Trump Hotel will stock your refrigerator with anything you may need, all you need to do is ask. 

Towels, soaps, shampoo, and and other amenities were plentiful. The hotel has a turn-down service, the housekeepers brought candy, and a stuffed animal toy for our daughter to play with. Bottled water is complimentary, the refrigerator is stocked with it, and the staff at the entrance will give you water to carry with you when you leave the hotel. 

Though the hotel doesn't have direct beach access, there is a path to the beach, and it takes only 5 minutes to get there. If you are going to the beach, the hotel kindly offers a beach bag, which includes towels, bottled water, and snacks. 

A good thing about the hotel is that is is located not far from the Royal Hawaiian Center, and a nice shopping and eating district with good stores and restaurants. Across the way is an ABC mart, a 7-11, and a large Long Drugs store, which is the cheapest place to get snacks, drinks, and necessities. 

The lounge and restaurants at the hotel are very good. Prices are fair (we are from Tokyo, so ""fair"" is a relative term), portions are very large. Surprisingly, the Trump Hotel is very kid-friendly. The restaurant has a good child's menu with deserts, and the staff are very friendly to children. 

We enjoyed the breakfast buffet every morning, it had a good selection of dishes, and you can also order ala carte. The coffee is Hawaiian, and very good. 

The hotel has a pool which is comfortably heated. There is a shallow section where small children can play, the pool is not very large, but is long enough to swim in. The poolside lounge chairs are comfortable, food and beverages are served poolside. 

Overall the Trump Hotel offers everything one could want, large rooms, excellent service, good food, and excellent amenities. We will definitely stay there again in the future.","Date of stay: October 2018","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

You might get lower rates, but at the same time you become a ""second category"" guest, when any trouble/issue you have with the hotel is sorted out in a very complicated way (ie. not directly by the hotel, but rather by a third party provider). So if you ask for 2 beds or a high floor room, they say ""no"", because you booked the king bed room and all rooms in the inventory of the third party provider are sold out. No matter that the hotel actually has 2 beds or a high floor rooms available!!! With booing at such expensive property you might also be offered to sleep on the sofa(!) if you are in the need of second bed. I would never expect this could happen at 5* start ""luxury"" resort. 

As to the property itself, its location is perfect, as you are close to the Waikiki and the streets around are full of various shops and fast foods/coffee shops. From the hotel you might have a very nice view over the Waikiki. On the other hand, there is a noise from the street (especially from buses).

Rooms are nice, but not very large. Beds are very low and mattresses too soft. So sleeping is not comfortable. Bathroom is large and nice. 

The hotel serves breakfast, but it is quite expensive, definitely you might have better options just across the street at Starbucks or Beach Cafe.

The hotel offers just ""valet parking"", which however worked efficiently and the staff around the concierge was nice and helpful.

Net net, this is not such a luxury property as one could expect. And I was really surprised that the Trump hotel accepts that some of its guests are treated with less respect than the others. Not sure if they realize that in fact any issues during the stay at Trump hotel just give bad reputation to the facility itself. So it is rather unlikely that I would stay here again.","Date of stay: September 2018","Trip type: Traveled with friends","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Check in - aloha is a state of mind at the trump. Everything was perfect. I felt the weight of the world fall off my shoulders. 

Room - 2 bedroom, 3 bathroom apartment. Best view of Waikiki (and the fireworks). Huge kitchen, 2 terraces, really amazing place. 

Pool - outstanding. Amazing view and a great place to spend a few hours (or a day!)

Gym - sufficient but if could do with some more free weights, bench press, pull up bars or an adjustable rig. I’m nit picking! 

Restaurants - amazing. All of them. Try the 9 - 11 pm happy hours and the mai tais! 

I travel a lot, and rarely review unless it’s outstanding or the opposite. Trump international Waikiki is the best on the island, bar none.","Date of stay: October 2018","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Pros:

-Service is excellent. People smile everywhere always checking if I am ok. Job well done!
- Facility is generally well maintained. Glass wall around the pool area needs some work but overall is good
- Location

Cons:

- blankets in my bedrooms are WAY too thick. I sweated every night before I had my blankets switched out
- bed in my master bedroom squeaks when I move. I complained to front desk, I was told someone was going to take a look into it, and it wasn’t fixed when I last left the building
- bed bugs. What can I say? I got bitten.

At this price point there are options in the area. This is my second stay and I think I need to try something else.","Date of stay: September 2018","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

Our initial room (2 bedroom ocean view prime) had some maintenance issues and the hotel staff had no hesitation in moving us to a 2 bedroom plus den ocean view prime room.  

The room is massive.  The kitchen / lounge area is large enough for 4 adults to comfortable relax without being on top of each other.  The bedrooms are massive and incredibly comfortable.  There were 3 full bathrooms, a laundry and 2 balconies.  Ample staff for us all.

The room was immaculately clean and housekeeping were fantastic, always restocking our amenities / water etc.

The location of the hotel is great - a 2 minute walk to the beach and right behind the beachwalk where there is an abundance of restaurants.

The only negative is the pool which is quite small and because of it's location, can be incredibly windy.  The glass around the pool was very dirty so we sadly couldn't see much of a view.  There were always lounges available and no issue in getting poolside service.  Would also be great if there was an adults only pool.

What really sets this hotel apart is the service.  From the moment we arrived, we were greeted warmly and treated like royalty.  Nothing was ever too much trouble. This is the only hotel where I have ever experienced true 5 star service.  Thank you to all of the staff we encountered during our stay, you made it truly pleasurable.

Valet staff are all very friendly; you can ask for bottled water when you get the car. Hotel also provides complimentary beach bag with towels, water and some fruits. 
Room is nice size with balcony. Kitchen is well-stocked with all the tools you could possibly need, including a rice cooker. One thing I especially appreciated is the abundant towels in the room. In Hawaii climate and with beach trips we generally shower twice per day so having 6 bath towels comes very handy. We stayed in other hotels in this trip and had to constantly call to ask for more towels. 
Hotel is conveniently located within 1 block from beach and 2 blocks from the shopping area. But the nearest beach is not the best part of Waikiki beach; the bottom is pretty rocky. We had to walk a while through 2 other hotels to use the better beach (in front of Sheraton and Royal Hawaiian). Many great restaurants in the neighborhood (Roy's, Tonkatsu Ginza). 
There were two things we didn't like though...Pool is tiny and all lounge chairs were occupied when we went after lunch. Also, I'd suggest to move the breakfast area to the west side of the building. In-Yo cafe was extremely hot in the morning and we couldn't enjoy our breakfast.","Date of stay: September 2018","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Bar and restaurant choices were very limited.  Pool was exceptionally small and mostly in the shade.  Of the three rooms that our travelling group stayed in over four days, the air conditioning was definately not up the the job.  None of the rooms would go below about 72 degrees Fahrenheit despite a setting of 65 degrees.  The air constantly felt a bit muggy in all rooms as a result.  The bathrooms in all suites didn't have a proper shower, but rather a tiled area next to tub which was out in the open.  Two of the three rooms had no doors between master bath and master bedroom.  Kitchens in all rooms were very well fitted with top-notch appliances.  Furniture and carpet in rooms was varied - from worn and cramped to neat, depending on the room.  

The highlights of the hotel - concierge and staff.  I've rarely encountered a more friendly staff at a hotel.  Service levels were generally good to high standard.  The concierge was especially  helpful with activity planning.

Public areas of hotel are very average in the space and finish-out.   Four elevators which are used both by staff and guests creates wait times in excess of five minutes during peak periods.  The five star rating by Forbes doesn't compare to a four star rating by the industry standards.  I give this hotel 3.5 stars due to limitations of services, restaurants, public space and room finish out.","Date of stay: August 2018","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

Everyone at the hotel greeted us with smiles and seemed genuinely interested in our plans for the day.  We really enjoy our stay at the Trump Hotel.  The only knock I have against the hotel is the small infinity pool.  Had to use it because my 2 years old son wanted to swim in the pool and it was pretty packed.  Very small for the hotel size.

I booked a deluxe ocean view two bedroom suit with Amex’s Fine Resort & Hotels, and was upgraded to a premium two bedroom suite with a den.

Our check-in process was smooth with cold towels and beverage offered for the short 5 minutes wait, then a lovely lady at the front desk escorted us to our suite, and explain all the amenities offered on the hotel.  Very welcoming!

Our suite was clean, spacious, and has all the top end amenities that my three teens, my husband and I are used to at our home.  Because what is the point of staying in a hotel, if your home is more comfortable and has better furniture and amenities - unless its a business trip.  The full kitchen with the surprise addition of a wine cooler, bowls and chopsticks, are very useful.  

All staff are friendly and accommodating.  Sarah is so nice.  Sarah made hard to obtain last minute dinner reservations for us, booked daily car rental for us when we needed it, and gave us directions to points of interest for us to navigate the island on our own. So helpful!

The remainder of the days went without a hitch.  Trump has private  rooms for guests to with late flights and this came in extremely handy as I had a late departure.

In addition if you stay on this side of the hotel you can catch the firework spectacular  every Friday evening whilst lounging on the Lanai.The twice daily room servicing means you always have an endless supply of big fluffy towels  and top grade appliances in the kitchenette are just begging to be used. All in all a wonderful experience with nothing too much bother for the staff.","Date of stay: June 2018","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Only a short 5 walk to centre of the town and 2 minute to beach. Staff were friendly but didn’t find the service to be any different to other accommodations we’ve previously booked.  Complementary beach bags given with towels, water and fruit on the way out was a great idea.  Beautiful pool and smallish hot spa. Was a little busy at times but always had a chair with plenty of towels available. Didn’t have breakfast so can’t comment on that.

From the minute we arrived the service difference was like comparing fine dining (trump) and mcdonalds (all the other hotels).  Trump staff are very polished, unobtrusive and an absolute asset to the Trump brand.  We only stayed at the trump for a bit of a laugh and we were actually blown away.  The suite was huge, with a full kitchen, washer/dryer, living area x2 and a dining table that sat about 8 from memory. two bathrooms and a huge bedroom. We arrived with champagne and a fruit platter on the table. The bath products were luxury compared to the bog standard stuff at other 5 star hotels. The balcony has an amazing views across the beach and up to diamond head.  there were only 8 suites on our floor so very spacious indeed. 

We had dinner in Wai-olu and was actually speechless at the quality and preparation of the sea food. The japanese chef was a master of his profession and every piece of sushi was mouth watering. The barman (a Hawaiian born man) was just perfect for the clientele. He engaged with us at the right time and without wanting to offend anyone, he was quiet when talking. There wasn't the typical shouty american 'look at me everyone' going on.  We also tried room service, we had a steak and more seafood and it was top quality.

The pool is fine, but we didn't use it. The beach is only a block away.  

Trump Hotel Waikiki absolutely beats the Hilton Village (ali and rainbow tower stayed four times), Sheraton (stayed twice) and Outrigger (stayed once).  We went there as a joke but the jokes on us as we had no idea how amazing it would be.  We will book Trump in future.","Date of stay: April 2018","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I've stayed here several times and can attest to the quality of the people. 

My only issue is that there's a blimp of a woman who ""swims"" here every morning. I think she lives in the building. Technically she walks in the water in slow motion, but she constantly annoys people who are trying to swim. She doesn't want to get wet and given her size, she takes up a lot of the pool's width. What a clown. Her husband seems nice; I feel bad for him.

Otherwise, would highly recommend staying here. Great people, modern hotel. Close to all the shopping.","Date of stay: December 2017","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I honestly was really hesitant to stay here again this trip just because of all the politics involved, but I've never had better service at any other hotel before so decided to just go for it again!  So glad we did!  Valet and housekeeping were excellent as always.  Was so happy to get upgraded to a 1 bedroom with den.  The size was perfect with my 2 young kids since they took naps during the day because of the time difference from home.  Having the kitchen is so convenient when you get tired of eating out every day and just want a simple meal.  For example, by the end of the trip the kids just wanted PB&J sandwiches.  Instead of searching all over the place for one, we just made it in our room. 

Really, the reason why we keep coming back is because the service just can't be beat here.  You are treated so well and all the employees are just so nice and friendly.

We loved the gorgeous views from our room. We could see the full beachside fireworks on Friday from our balcony. We also had a view of the ocean and the other 2 hotel pools next to us. 

We ordered some in-room dining and Mai Tais on Friday evening. After 30 mins, the hotel called to apologize that there’s been a mix up and our food got delayed. The delay really wasn’t very long. The food arrived after another 15 mins. To our pleasant surprise, the hotel waived the charges for our food & cocktails.

Check in was very pleasant. The reception staff very kindly let us check in early at 10am. He provided us good rates for our room upgrade & accompanied us around the hotel to view 3-4 rooms before we decided on one. 

We loved that Conceirge provided a very nice complimentary beach bag with towels, water & fruits. And the Conceirge staff were very helpful with directions & car rental. 

We didn’t like that despite booking our car rental with Trump, we had to walk to Enterprise at Outrigger across the road and queue for 30 mins to pick it up. It would have been nice to have the car driven over to us. 

Considering that we were on our honeymoon, it would have been nice if the hotel had provided a complimentary room upgrade. 

The reception staff did try very hard to sell us a room upgrade at check it. However, it was handled very tactfully and pleasantly.

When you arrive you instantly realise this hotel is a cut above, the greeting by the staff makes you feel so welcome. The check in isn’t until 4pm which is a bit late I feel but it's quick and efficient and you’re in your room followed swiftly by your bags. 

We had a Ocean View room with a balcony, and WOW what a view.  Overlooking Waikiki beach and the harbour and facing directly at the sunset every night. Bonus was the Hilton’s firework display every Friday. 
The room had a kitchenette, lounge area, a large bathroom. 
The kitchenette is very useful for breakfasts and keeping your 'sundowners on the balcony' booze cold! You don’t even have to wash the dishes, housekeeping will do this. Oh, and please remember to leave a gratuity every day for them, this is the USA and the tipping culture still prevails. 
  
First gripe, and it’s been said on many reviews, is the pool is so small it’s almost non existent. We couldn’t get a lounger by the pool in the 13 days we were there. However, they have addressed this issue by supplying beach bags containing towels, water and fruit. The hotel is a short walk to the beach so we used this service when we weren’t away sightseeing and it worked really well. Even my wife, who doesn’t normally like to sunbathe on the sand, enjoyed it here.
 
Second Gripe is the drinks happy hour. This is prolifically advertised but it’s not a happy hour that really cuts the mustard. If you’re expecting something like 2 for1 cocktails or discounted drinks as is the norm, you’ll be disappointed. The discounts only apply to 3 lines on the extensive drinks menu and it’s not much of a discount at that, and none of the drinks we wanted were on there. We went somewhere else.
But these are small irritants in an otherwise fantastic hotel.

On to the plus points 
Room, excellent, clean, tidy, never short of high class toiletries or towels. The shower is a wet room type and the bath is very deep, this might be an issue if you’re slightly infirm though as the sides are quite high.
  It had a toilet from Star Trek. It had its own remote control. Obviously aimed at the Japanese market as I’ve never seen these in Europe. A fascinating experience is all I can say!
We washed some swimwear and left it over the side of the bath, when we came back they’d put a drying rack in the bathroom which stayed there throughout our stay. Those are the little attentions to detail that make you realise this is no ordinary hotel. 
There’s a turn down service every night when they will restock your room with toiletries, tea, coffee etc.

Gym. There’s a small but perfectly adequate gym on the same floor as the Spa. The equipment is of a high standard an looks fairly new. Running machines, Cross Trainers that double up as steppers (they’re called Vario machines) Cable weight machines, free weights and a couple of benches. Yoga mats and core training equipment. There’s water and towels and everything even free in ear headphones for you to take. Never seen that before. 

Dining. We only ate once in the hotel and that was in the WAI'OLU Restaurant. They do a brilliant half price deal after 9 o’clock. We’d got back late from an excursion and decided not to venture out and the waitress told us about the deal. Food was really good too. 

There’s free Wi-fi which is of a good speed. The hotel is situated within easy walking distance of Honolulu’s shops, bars and restaurants and about a 30 min walk to the Ala Moana mall.

We really loved it here, it was never noisy or overcrowded and the staff made you feel so special. Antione on the concierge desk is so helpful but having said that they all are. 
I wish I could remember the name of gentleman with the hat that looked like the senior guy in  the lobby, always greeted you with a fantastic smile and just made you feel so welcome when you returned. 

This was our second time in Honolulu but the first time in Trump, if we ever come back it would be to this hotel. Definitely!

My husband and I had previously stayed at this property 6 years ago and it was just as outstanding as we remembered. We booked a 9 night stay in a deluxe partial ocean view room for ourselves and our 4 year old daughter. On arrival our room was not ready (our flight arrived very early) but the staff were very good about keeping us informed of progress and were also very apologetic. On a side note, my Dad travelled with us and our request for our rooms to be located on the same floor was met without any issue at all. Our room was very spacious, even with the rollaway bed for our daughter, well appointed, perfectly clean and we loved having the lounge area and the full kitchen (even though we didn't make use of it because lets be honest who wants to cook on holidays).The hotel is perfectly located, close to shopping and dining on Kalakaua Ave, a 2 minute walk to the beach and a short bus or pink line shuttle trip to Ala Moana. Every staff member we encountered was polite, courteous and went over and above to make us feel welcome and to ensure that we enjoyed every minute of our holiday. A special mention to Julia in the Lobby area who made our daughter feel like a superstar every time she walked through the lobby (and who gave her a mountain of shell lei's to bring home). Also, a special mention to Akiko who has gone above and beyond for us even now we are home. The concierge staff were so helpful to us on multiple occasions, helping us to book a character breakfast at Aulani (which I am led to believe is near impossible) and helping me to locate my handbag when I left it in a restaurant. The pool area is beautiful, we never struggled to find a pool chair (for all 4 of us) and the food and cocktails were delicious. We also love the convenience of the beach bag, stocked with towels, fresh fruit and water and also made use of the umbrellas on more than one occasion. They really have thought of everything that you could need to make your stay wonderful and provided it. We enthusiastically recommend this hotel to our family and friends and we hope to return really soon.
A perfect example of the level of customer service to finish: I completed the survey the hotel sent once we had checked out and mentioned in passing that my daughter had not received her welcome gift - no harm done but just mentioned it.The following day I received an email with a sincere apology to my daughter and an offer to send the welcome gift to our home address in Australia. I thought it was a lovely offer but due to the expense of shipping didn't really imagine that it would arrive. Less than a week later I received an SMS notification that I had a parcel arriving from FedEx and a package addressed to my daughter arrived containing a super cute soft toy whale with a delightful letter to my daughter. Thank you Akiko, 'WhaleWhale' goes everywhere with my daughter since he arrived including to Kindergarten and to bed. He is very loved.","Date of stay: March 2018","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Always remembering our names & always happy to help with any reservation or detail. The rooms were spacious & well laid out with a bathroom that is happy to blow smoke up your butt.... as it’s one of those self cleaning toilets - an excellent little surprise when using the toilet. The hotel is very generous as it provides excellent beach bags to use during your stay with towels already packed in for you as well as some fruit and water bottles. The hotel was happy to provide complimentary water as part of the stay during the entire time. The only qualm we had is the pool sucks! It’s very small and doesn’t really accomodate the hotel guests. 

Overall these touches made us feel special appreciated and living in luxury all at a reasonable price tag! 

I would definitely stay here again over many other hotels including the Sheraton which is outdated and overly populated.

Besides the high quality of everything and the attention to detail (we requested the WSJ which was delivered to our room each day), the hotel managed to be in the the center of things--shopping, restaurants, steps to the beach, ocean views, parks--but without the crowds. Since our time was limited we wanted to be able to do a few things and still have time to relax.  Their spa was amazing and we dined twice at BLT which was excellent.  Although they bill themselves as a steak restaurant there was plenty for the pescatarian in our party to choose from. The breakfast buffet at In-yo Cafe was excellent and the waiting staff very friendly and helpful. The lounge billed their mai-tai as world famous and we simply had to try it. Absolutely delicious. The housekeeping staff is among the best.  They always seemed to know when we were out to service our rooms and they came twice daily so that everything was always pristine.

A large amount of planning went into this trip as I proposed to my now Fiancé hiking up Diamond Head crater. 
The whole concierge and front office staff where amazingly helpful as I had to get the ring sent to the hotel 3 days before our arrival as there was no time to get it sent to Aus before our trip. 

Naturally being a bit nervous about sending something of such high monetary and emotional value, after talking with Hiroshi and Sarah through many emails and phone calls I was very rest assured and confident of it’s safe arrival and it being secure. And as they assured me, it was there safe and secure when I needed to retrieve it so a special thank you to you both on your amazing help and service!!

We got upgraded to a suite and the room was spectacular, looking over the beach and having a perfect view of the fireworks. The room was clean and spacious and we felt comfortable the whole duration of our stay. 
The hotel being in such a great location close to the beach and shopping/eating districts was a massive plus for us. It was also super convenient that a car hire place was right around the corner which the front desk helped us with which was greatly appreciated. 

Staff were all super friendly and helpful at all times and genuinely seemed very happy with their jobs which shone through with their excellent service. 

Easily the best hotel we have stayed at out of anywhere we’ve been in Asia, Aus, mainland USA and NZ. 

We will definitely be back! If we could rate it higher than excellent we would!

This is definitely a five star hotel and at the top of my list for properties in Hawaii. From check-in to check-out everything was 5 star! 

We were personally escorted to our rooms by the main marketing and relations managers. The flowers throughout the hotel were freshly prepared and gave off a wonder ful tropical ambience. 

The fitness center was fully equipped and the hotel offered complimentary Under Armor shoes, shorts, shirts, for working out! This is great as we don't need to carry sweaty gym clothes back into our luggage.

The pool was amazing, relaxing, and offered ocean views. They offer poolside dining and service.

The restaurant options were plentiful in the area and within the hotel. I had a chance to try out the Wai‘olu Ocean Cuisine and the in-room dining. Both were tasty and I definitely recommend the sushi. 

The rooms itself were outstanding and exceptional. The beds were plush, the showers were large and the walk-in closets were a great surprise. 

The location is nearby everything and walking distance to the beach. It has one of the best locations in Waikiki.

The den area had a pull-out sofa-lounge which was made up to a double bed for our little 2 year old, there was a 3rd smaller bathroom with a shower over bath, single vanity (all 3 bathrooms had own toilets), amenities Natura Bisse, which was lovely . Each Bed area plus the lounge room had a Television, 4 in total. 
In suite washing machine/dryer with washing powder replenished daily. 
Spacious Kitchen/dining/lounge area with a balcony housing an outdoor table & 4 chairs. Full kitchen with all appliances required & coffee/teas/bottled water replenished daily. 
View from both balconies spectacular, overlooking Waikiki Beach which is a short 2 minute walk away. Trump Hotel is located right in the city which is convenient for shopping & restaurants, so we walked everywhere as it was so easy.
The Pool area is quite small but when we were there it was hardly ever crowded, an infinity lap pool with a small hot tub on the side, excellent poolside service.
Excellent service from all the staff we met, so very courteous, friendly & helpful.
We went to Happy Hour in the Wai'olu Ocean View Lounge most evenings & Troy was our main man who was there most nights, he was always happy & friendly & his service to us was excellent. The lounge area is a quiet & relaxing atmosphere.
The food at Trump is simply amazing, we voted their Chicken wings as the best we have ever tasted & their Mai Tai is voted Best in the World & we totally agree.
The service from all staff was excellent, our rooms were beautifully cleaned daily & if we could rate this Hotel better we would.
We would love to come back & stay here in the future.","Date of stay: February 2018","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The suites are the best I've stayed in but the main reason we keep coming back is the way we are treated by the staff. Stepping out of the taxi on arrival and being greeted so warmly by Dean & the rest of the bell staff and welcomed back is a great start. The shell lei you are greeted with is lovely & a great souvenir. The check-in process is a very pleasant experience as you are greeted with hand towels and an iced drink while checking in. A special thank you to Mr Hiroshi Kanzaki for all his care, even before we arrived and then for looking after us so well. Our suite was very spacious and well stocked with amenities and had a wonderful view of the ocean. I was travelling with my sister and really appreciated the extra bedroom so that we both were comfortable. Staff go out of their way to make sure you enjoy your stay so don't hesitate to ask if you need something. We stayed for seven nights and loved every moment. Afternoons by the pool were a great way to relax after a morning spent shopping or sightseeing. One afternoon we were pleasantly surprised with complimentary mango daiquiris, a lovely touch. 

I can't recommend this hotel more highly. I've stayed at other hotels in the area and felt like I was just a number, but here you really feel valued and welcome.","Date of stay: January 2018","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I agree with other reviewers, not really a resort but I would classify more as a hotel. My two teenagers loved the free smoothies at hotel pool.

Two bizarre events occurred during our stay though... we washed our smalls (socks, jocks and underwear) and laid them flat on seat of outdoor chair on balcony only to return to find all our ladies underwear missing. Other socks and men’s underwear remained. Remaining items had not moved from their place with a gap remaining where the ladies underwear previously sat. There was no breeze/wind, and chairs were against the building wall away from balcony glass fence. Only access to balcony was from interior door.  Can not explain where they disappeared ... our room had been serviced upon our return.
Also, every night routinely 20-30 mins after getting into bed I received an allergic reaction (extensive hot, itchy body rash - gradually worsened after every night) due to what can only be assumed to be the bedding or chemicals/detergents/starches the bedding was washed in. I’ve never had a reaction like this before in any other hotel I’ve stayed at after extensive travel throughout Europe/Asia and Australia. Luckily I had antihistamines packed that I was able to take during our stay, symptoms settled after taking tablets until the next night the same occurred. I have never experienced a reaction like this before and used my own toiletries during our stay so the bedding was the only thing we could pinpoint as contributing factor of rash.  Our diet was unchanged and not different to what we’d normally have at home. 

Even though we had a pleasant stay, due to the two bizarre events mentioned above, they are enough for us to question if we would return.","Date of stay: December 2017","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

If you are with the kinds, you would enjoy it but if you are looking for a quiet relaxing time lounging by the pool with cocktails, you will be very disappointed as it just becomes kinds pool during the holiday seasons.  

We understand that it was one of the busiest time when many Japanese celebrities and their families stay there so the guest relations are fully occupied for VIPs. Bell boys never recognize our faces and we often were asked if we were checking in when we drove back to the hotel during our 8(eight) days of our stay(we used valet parking 2-3/day and of course tipped them normally). We have stayed at several resorts in many countries that make you feel like you are home and so welcomed. Obviously this hotel was not one of them.

Service at the Wailou was terrible. Very slow and food was cold as they seemed like they were shorthanded.

Staff was friendly and professional and service was great. Location is a quick walk to the beach. They give out beach bags to take with towel, water and snack which was very thoughtful. Valet service was always quick. Suite was spacious with high-end appliances and clean. Hair dryer and coffee maker was bit underwhelming considering the luxurious touches this suite had, but that's a very minor complaint. We found the pool and hot tub to be small. Hotel was considerate in letting us check out late b/c of our late night flight which our elderly parents appreciated very much.

The amenities in the room are of high standards , having the little kitchen was great we didn't use it but was well stocked. They do offer beach bags for the beach with towels and water check at the concierge for it. The views from the hotel are great nice pool . Good restaurants in the hotel. We found it felt more like living in your own Condo , the housekeeping staff are like ninjas you don't seem them, but our room was always clean and night turn down service.

Very lovely staff who were professional and friendly. The hotel was new'ish (I believe the second newest in Waikiki) and everything was clean and well maintained.  The rooms were very comfortable and I was surprised how close to the beach we were - only across the road and down a lane way.  We had great views of the fireworks (fireworks happen every Friday night). There was a small lap pool which was great and plenty of room to cool off.  
The breakfast was lovely - good range of food and again the wait staff was very lovely.
Both room and bathroom were lovely and big and the balcony was a good size.  Our particular balcony had a glass floor which wasn't great for my hubby who doesn't like heights - If this is a concern for you, ask for another room is my advice.   

Note: Nothing to do with the Trump tower but what is it with whipped butter in the US... asked for butter with breakfast and received this very light, 'white' butter - very strange tasting butter for this Aussie girl :) 

While there is nothing I could fault with the hotel there was also nothing that overly wowed me given the cost... but I would stay again.","Date of stay: October 2017","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

This kitchenette was the best appointed ever - a SubZero refrigerator with an ice maker and wine shelf, all of the dishes, pans, coffee maker and necessary items to either snack or eat in. Every employee was friendly, helpful and kind. They have done a great job of finding employees who love their jobs.

Every need is covered from the moment you arrive. 

We had a rental car which was promptly whisked away by the valet as our bags were taken up to our room. On check in we were given a cool drink and beautiful shell leis, just a hint at the service Trump International Hotel Waikiki would provide. 

Upon arriving at our room, it felt like arriving home. We had a full kitchenette with everything we could need (including a blender and mixer - just in case we felt like a smoothie or cupcakes!) and the most comfortable bed. 

Each morning we enjoyed a quick swim at the beach - just a stones throw away - picking up our complimentary beach bags at the concierge desk, complete with bottled water, fruit and towel and most days were spent wandering and shopping around the area with Waikiki's Ala Wai Boulevard and surrounding streets full of incredible shopping. 

If you're looking for nearby activities, Atlantis Submarines is just around the corner, the Friday Fireworks are a must see and Steak Shack just across the road is one of the most unsuspecting and delicious eateries on the island.

I would recommend this hotel to anyone who needs a little pampering. There is a Spa and Fitness Center, as well as a Library with three computers, a printer and newspapers. There are even some books left by other guests.

We were upgraded to a one-bedroom suite with two baths, a full gourmet kitchen, with everything you would need to cook some meals at ""home"". The best thing about it is that the staff will do the dishes, even though there is a dishwasher. I did the coffee cups one day and the next time we saw the two staff members who came in they said I didn't have to do that, it's part of their job. After that I didn't do the dishes, although I felt guilty!

There are morning staff members and there are two who come in the evening for turn down service. If anything needs to be replaced such as water, coffee, cream and sugar, it will happen both times. That's great for coffee fiends. The staff always works in pairs.

Request a high floor for best views. If possible, get a room facing Fort DeRussey where you can see the Friday night fireworks from the Hilton Hawaiian Village beach.

Parking is Valet only. I don't know how much since we were able to park in Fort DeRussey since we are retired veterans.","Date of stay: November 2017","Trip type: Traveled on business","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Stayed ten nights in the deluxe 'full ocean view' suite. 

Firstly, the staff were great. Very friendly and welcoming, and happy to help where they could. They did an amazing job.

All the food we ate there was delicious, prepared quickly and more or less, reasonably priced.

Location was great for the tourism side of Waikiki, but was not ideal for quiet relaxation. It is so centralised that you feel on top of everyone and everything, and there was constant traffic noise (given I was there for my honeymoon I would have preferred to have the quiet- but this is my fault for not researching it fully). 

When we checked in we were given a free upgrade and offered a discounted upgrade on top of that. We took the discounted upgrade and had a huge room that had everything you could want/need. Poor points about the room is that it was sold to us as ""full ocean view"" but 2/3's of the views from the two baloneys were of the city (which is partly to blame for all the traffic noise). It was still an amazing view, but not what I would have considered ""full ocean views"". The furniture in the room looked ten years old and dated, and the televisions looked fifteen. The bed and pillows were too uncomfortable to get a good nights sleep.

I wish is didn't take the upgrade.

Upon checkin we were told that we would be given complementary champagne and a surprise. We never received the champagne and the surprise was two packaged biscuits, around 4cm long...

I found someone else's top in the washing machine in the room- but everything else was very clean.

The pool...I understand that this is a beach resort..but for the cost of the rooms, and considering it's a 5 star hotel, the pool was tiny. It was less than half the size you would expect, was very shallow, and constantly filled with splashing kids (no issues with the kids wanting to have fun- but issues with the pool being too small to allow it).","Date of stay: October 2017","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

From the moment we arrived we were all treated like royalty.  The service area took our luggage for us and told us that they would bring it up to our room.  Went to the Lobby on the 2nd floor and the desk was very helpful and explained everything-no issues checking in.  When we got up to our room-2 bedroom plus den we were pleasantly surprised on how spacious it was-Room 1 had 2 twin beds that were quickly turned into a King when we called down for them to change it.  Huge bathroom-shower and bathtub, walking closet, and a great size bedroom, 2nd bedroom had a queen bed with nice size bathroom-shower,  There was also a 3rd bathroom with shower in main area.  Rooms were on different sides of the room so couples could have privacy.  The living room was spacious and the den had a sofa and separate area.  The Kitchen was well equipped with bottled water in fridge and cream for coffee.  They always replenished coffee and tea.  Towel service was at 7:00 pm and they put fresh towels.  It was very clean and we were totally impressed.  They had 2 bottles of champagne for us to celebrate our 30th Anniversary, plus a tin of cookies.  It was simply wonderful.  If you wanted to cook you could-we just bought breakfast items at the ABC Stores-located on every corner.  
The Concierge Service was the best we have ever experienced -Crystal Nichols, Yuki Saito and Christie were unbelievably helpful, from restaurant suggestions, to reservations to just making us feel so welcomed-they should be commended for their exceptional service!  Every morning they created us by name and they asked if there was anything they could do for us.  We need help with a car rental and before you knew it, car was reserved. Before we left to return home Yuki saw us sitting in the waiting area and brought us cold water as it was really hot--wonderful, wonderful service When staying at the Trump you walk across the street to go to the beach-they provided a beach bag with towels, cold water and fruit.  Trump Hotel has a spot on the beach to rent umbrellas and Chairs at a $25.00/hour cost but they gave it to us for 2 hours at no extra charge.  
Trump Hotel is really in a great spot-short walk to all the shops, beach and restaurants.

Shower design and kitchen can't be even better. We got a good deal as we were there beginning of October and know we were very lucky to be in a hotel like this. When we're flying out at 11pm at night and there, check out is 12pm so we asked the front desk a day before to see if we can stay later they told us our room is booked but they will provide us a hospitality room. When we got to the room it was amazing and nice. We really appreciate every moment we were there. We liked the clean hotel environment and how it wasn't stuffy and pool was great. The view was fabulous. I could really go on and on how great it was but I will stop here. Thank you everyone at TRUMP HOTEL FOR ALL YOUR SERVICE.   I love you Donald Trump everything that has your. Ame is fabulous and great. Thank you for being our president. God Bless you.","Date of stay: October 2017","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Comparing to others, Trump Waikiki is more suitable for a couple, a family with infant, or adults.
Pool located on 6th fl. is an infinite-type but narrow and small kind, not for children's water play at all. 
Hotel's in pretty nice location, easy access to major shopping/eatery points in minutes.
At this time my family stayed in Suite, totally recommend to whom is a party of more than 4, or with youngster children.
Space is huge. Equipped with 2 rest rooms and 2 balconies, 3 TVs, and a kitchen with all cook wares (great for fixing  snacks at any time) and laundry /dryer (we loved it!)

Hotel service is in high standard, however, somewhat different by occasion..  Front & Reception:5✩  Superb. So much helpful. Attache services: 4✩ Very friendly and supportive and FAST. Garage: 3✩ Prompt and fast,  well mannered. Housekeeping: Hmmmm.. I don't know, 1 ✩ maybe..?pretty not much of prompt nor perfect ( missing somethings to be replaced and refilled, but not that serious though. You always can ask via calling Attache services. )
In overall, great hotel of course.","Date of stay: October 2017","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

The bathrooms were stocked up with extra towels and toiletries which makes a huge difference compared to other hotels. The turn down service was exceptional as when I returned from the beach I didn't realise how much sand you can hide within yourself so I accidentally left a lot of sand in the bathroom however this was cleaned up on the evening turn down service (I didn't even request this) the toilets were amazing also.

Greeted by the valet staff with leis, water and hand towels. They helped with our belongings up to our room while we checked in. Staff was excellent and super responsive to our needs. They kept checking on us if we were ok or we needed this or that. Super awesome! 
Opened the door to our two bedroom suite and was just in awe of the scenery and surroundings of Waikiki, and very much pleased with the design and decor of the room. We checked in on a Friday night, which we had a free fireworks show from our two balconys. We then made dinner for all eight of us in that beautiful gourmet kitchen stocked with every appliance needed. Maid service then came in to turn down for us which was an extra bonus. They made our sofa beds and checked on anything else we needed. We had three bathrooms very beautiful. Enough to accommodate my eight family members. Bedrooms were awesome, especially my master bed/bath, with walk in closet walk in shower and a huge separate bath tub. We were living the life I tell you! I can't wait to go back.

I originally booked my family through Costco Travel, and to be honest I had a lot of apprehension staying here due to all the publicity associated with the name (good and bad). All that unnecessary worrying disappeared as soon as we pulled up and we're greeted by the valet and concierge. First impressions last a lifetime, and the VIP treatment we received from Hisashi, valet, and Julia, concierge, led me to believe that I made the right decision in booking our stay here. 

Our concierge patiently introduced us to the amenities, eventually taking us to the 6th floor lobby, where I met with Brent who efficiently checked us in. Despite myself politely declining an offer to upgrade to a larger 2 bedroom/2 bath suite (in lieu of the 1 bed/2bath+extended den executive I reserved), Brent still upgraded me to the larger suite, **with no additional charge** :). Much credit to Brent for providing a totally awesome upgrade!!!!!! Moreover, we had an early flight into the island, so while we were several hours early from the standard 4pm checkin, Brent secured us a recently cleaned room asap!!

Our upgraded unit was only on the 9th floor (room #903) but provided beautiful views of Waikiki Beach and Honolulu high rises/hills on the other (our particular stay had 2 balconies). The service staff are so efficient at minimizing interruptions that I hardly saw them; and that's on top of the twice daily cleanings they performed on our unit!! 

The hotel is near the tail end of Waikiki Beach, and although it isn't directly on the beach, concierge will gladly provide you a bag filled with towels, suntan lotion, and water free of charge. On evenings, you can make a quick stroll to some of the shopping boutiques a few blocks north of the hotel; that my wife and mom definitely appreciated lol. Plenty of dining/food options are also within a 10min walk from here as well. 

What sold me was the great service and interaction every staff member provides to guests here. Hisashi (the evening valet) was quite personable to us that I see him as a new friend. In fact, he interacted so well with my 4 year old daughter that to this day she still asks about him! And then there's Julia (concierge), who was quite bubbly that she would play games and talk to my daughter while we waited for our car. And finally, there was Antoine, who despite my error, made sure I got to try their world famous Mai Tai late at night, despite bar/room service closing shortly. 

Simply put, Trump Intl Waikiki left a lasting impression on us. Please do not let the name and politics skew your opinion of this hotel; it certainly hasn't for us as we are planning to return here again for our next vacation!!!!","Date of stay: September 2017","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

All the staff from Valet, concierge, front desk, housekeeping.. the people at the bar... to security are just FANTASTIC. I really can't put into words what a great quality group that runs the hotel. 

Special shoutout to Dean from Valet... Julia...Hiryoshy (?)... Leo from security.

I've stayed at The Modern Honolulu... The Moana... and the Royal Hawaiian upon previous visits and the Trump
hotel definitely stands out amongst them all.

The amenities in the room are the most modern I've seen throughout Waikiki. The Kitchenette was fully loaded and they refill it with water daily if you request it. Theirs a stove.. silverware.. plating... and cups/glasses if your desire is to cook during your stay. Theirs to huge closets to accommodate 2 people comfortable. Ironing board. Mini living room. Great bed with UNREAL comfortable pillows. The balcony was a nice touch. Great way to drink your morning coffee or have your evening nightcap. 

I'm a huge fan of beautiful hotel bathrooms and this one came close. Suggestion... revamp your blowdryers to include diffusers! It's 2017 and you are a five star hotel. 

Housekeeping is beyond on top of it my room always felt made up with fresh towels! Wonderful!

I did try the Mai Tai at the bar because it was rated the best in 2011..and I must say I thought it was the best in Waikiki for 2017. I did spend the trip exploring the different Mai Tai's at ""Duke's""...the ""Bar leather apron"" ( award winning for 2015) BUT the one at the hotel really did blow me away! A MUST!

I got to experience a massage at the spa which was great! I would have enjoyed better relaxing music and the bed to be warm upon laying in it but those are just suggestions. You're greeted with a tasty treat and tea and then your feet are washed before they take you in for your treatment! It was really a treat!

As other people have stated the pool is unfortunately mediocre and taken over by kids which is a bit annoying. As an adult with no children it would be nice to stay at such a luxurious resort with a Adults Only Pool area. The beach is SO close so I'm guessing that's why the hotel
Didn't invest in creating such a pool! Don't forget to grab your beach bag from Concierge which includes towels, 2 mini waters, and fruit!

Time sure flies, when my wife and I reflect back on our last visit here in 2011. This visit did not disappoint and it was just as good, if not better. The Service was on par in all facets. When you check-in, you are greeted with professionalism and treated like a VIP. Special mention goes out to Bell Desk Attendant, Timothy. Throughout our stay here, he always took the time to stop what he was doing, greet us with a genuine smile and ask us how was our stay going.

The 500 square foot deluxe suite is perfect luxury for a weekend getaway, The kitchenette is well-equipped to prepare meals and the compact refrigerator is large enough to store your leftover restaurant meals. The furniture and carpeting is showing a little wear & tear, but nothing in the crisis mode. The Housekeeping teams on the 14th floor was professional, discreet and efficient in performing their duties for the morning service and the nightly turn-down service. Parking is valet only, at $34 a night, which is pretty reasonable as compared to other valet service by the surrounding hotel valets.

All in all, we can't say enough good things about this property. The Service here is top-notch 1st class all the way and worthy of their 5-star rating. Tip: Even numbered rooms face the Embassy Suites with some partial ocean view. While the Odd numbered rooms face the Fort Derussy park and clear sight lines of the ocean.","Date of stay: September 2017","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We had extremely nice and professional servers and all the staff at reception and concierge especially Crystal. 

We had a very nice room kitchenette and balcony ( beware not all rooms have a balcony). The sea is a block away (the hotel is not directly on the seafront) and the concierge have an arrangement which allows for the rental of a deckchair and an umbrella. Very partial sea view. The only disappointment was the very small size of the pool and the adjoining area. Also, while I didn't use it I was told by my daughter that the gym was small.

You will always be greeted with a smiling face and everyone there genuinely cares about you and the comfort of your stay. Some of my favorite staff members are Deen in bell services and Yuki in concierge. But I have had a wonderful experience with everyone there! They treat you like family!

This hotel is perfect for families or business travelers or anyone seeking a bit more than the average room in town. They have full kitchen amenities so you can reheat food, keep drinks stocked and even cook on a stove top if that is your thing.

The things I enjoy the most are the level of comfort, beautiful peaceful hotel, excellent location and just all the details they get right every single time! I love coming into the room and hearing beautiful Hawaiian music playing and having fresh complimentary water, beach bags, and beach towels. Some units even have washer and dryer which was perfect for my prior family stay.

I also got to take advantage of the spa and the massage I had was great after the long flight there. The spa is intimate and peaceful and again everyone there is all about service.

It is a good location, and reasonable good breakfast. 

Giving what is going on, we are seems the only American there, 99% people are Japanese. I appreciate the people working there, and they are helpful.

The hotel has a very small pool and bit walk to ocean, which is what we were looking for since our daughter has a cast on her arm after she broke her arm in playground. 

To me, the best part is its location, easy walk to everywhere, food truck, ABC store, coffee shop, and a beach.","Date of stay: August 2017","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Whilst not on the beach, it literally is opposite the beach. Also nearby are some boutique shops, Starbucks, Subway, ice cream place etc. A slightly longer Q1 minute walk and you are near loads of shops and restaurants.

The concierge is fantastic and had booked all the activities we wanted to do ( I had emailed them before we arrived). If you go on the beach, the hotel provides a bag with towels, water and fruit.

The breakfast buffet is amazing. Three different types of juices, Asian food, toast, pancakes, bacon, sausages, salad, muffins, yogurt, cereal, fresh fruit and freshly made eggs.

The room is a good size, with a small kitchen area and is kind of ocean facing. (View partially obliterated by building) but this didn't bother us too much.

The rooms are very clean and are serviced twice a day with all the amenities replaced.

All the staff are very polite and work hard to achieve a very good level of customer service.

Whilst the pool is a little small, I guess it's ok as most people go to the beach.

We loved this hotel, and I would definitely stay here again, the location and the lovely employees makes this a wonderful place for a holiday.","Date of stay: August 2017","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The concierge desk provided us with daily beach bags that included towels, water bottles and fresh fruit--we took advantage of this daily.  We did not eat in any of the hotel restaurants but did order room service which was promptly delivered, was hot upon arrival and was of excellent quality.

Modern and clean :) we stayed on Level 22 in an ocean view king bed suite with kitchenette. 
Perfect location for those who like to be close to the beach and shops, but not so close to the crazy busy part of Waikiki. We walked or trolley'd it to Ala Moana shops alot, as we preferred it to the main strip of shops. 

All staff said Aloha every time, housekeeping was excellent (I spotted a small patch of mould in the shower and it was cleaned up promptly), we were able to get a free early check-in when we landed at 5:20am, and the room was always super clean. The charger port by the bed was a great help to charge phones and gopro, the bathtub was nice and big so an actual adult could take a good ol' bubblebath, and the kitchenette was very useful. The pool was great but got crowded on some days. The yummy mojitos by the pool made it better :P The mai tai at the restaurant by the concierge is also delicious. 
The only thing that could make the room better would be international sockets like some other 4/5 star hotels have. Also I know alot of honeymooners come to Hawaii, but it would have been nice to get more than a bottle of champagne. Sounds a little selfish but considering what our friends' got in closeby competitor hotels, it was a bit disappointing especially for the price we paid. 
In the end, we did enjoy our stay :)","Date of stay: July 2017","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

It is 2 blocks max from the beach where you have access to rentals of all kinds: umbrellas, paddle boards, surf boards, floats, etc.  The beach is not extremely wide at this point but it opens up more the farther down you walk and there are not big waves so it is kid friendly.  There is a lot of surfing on smaller waves out a few hundred yards. There are lots of small shops around to get whatever you may have forgotten to bring and lots of food shops. 

The concierge provides you with a beach bag, towels and water as you head to the beach.  Just return it when you get back. 

The staff at the hotel were incredibly friendly from the greeters at the front to the concierge and restaurants. The concierge was spot on when asked for guidance to top beaches, luaus, restaurants, etc.  we never had a bad recommendation. 

The hotel is right in the  middle of all of the high end shops (2-4 blocks max) and several huge malls with many restaurants all around. Many times the best restaurants are the smaller holes in the wall types (Eggs N Things (Breakfast), Side Street Inn (Dinner)).

I don't think I can say enough good things about the Trump Waikiki.
We arrived at 9:30pm after travelling for more than 24 hours from London and were greeted with cold towels and fruit-infused water.
Our bags were taken off to our room, which was very kindly upgraded by the friendly staff member at the front desk. 

We were staying in a 1-bedroom suite on the 8th floor, looking towards the Pacific Ocean and Hilton Hawaiian Village (good view for the Friday night fireworks). 
Our suite included 2 bathrooms, 2 balconies, a walk-in wardrobe, a kitchen with a number of appliances, dining room and sitting room.

A tin of Honolulu Cookie's was waiting for us, and we were surprised with a bottle of champagne and chocolates the following day. 

Our room was cleaned daily to a very high standard, and we were offered a turn down service every day. The housekeeping staff were very attentive and friendly. 

Throughout the hotel, we were greeted with smiles and staff always willing to help, whether that was by the pool or when going out to the beach or on a tour. 

The buffet breakfast is superb. At around $70 for the two of us it was not cheap, but the sheer range of choice was fantastic, and we particularly liked the option of choosing our omelette. 

The infinity pool looks towards the Ocean but is relatively small. If you are looking to have a proper swim, I found early morning or sunset to be the quietest time. 

We also stayed at the Andaz Maui and Grand Hyatt Kauai on our honeymoon, but neither hotel came close to the service we were given at the Trump International Waikiki. 

We will definitely be returning in the future.

The hotel gives u the feel that u r in ur own home with full kitchen , great space n more . The breakfast is good with limited choices but worth . The pool is small but very clean which the best part in this hotel . The gym is good . The reception guys are amazing.  When ever u leave for beach the hotel gives u a bag with towels , water and fruit which is complimentary . The wifi is also good . There are lot of Restarant's just behind the hotel and 7eleven also located with more options . The partial room and ocean view room are similar just the difference is view . I always suggest to take room on the higher floor .above 30 minimum . The rooms are very clean . Toiletries are of very good quality . The hotel should work on the pressure of water in the bath area. Guys u must take this hotel . 
Well would like to thank the hotel for giving  a bottle of champagne complimentary . 

Otherwise the hotel staff is very helpful .

We stayed in a Deluxe Room-City View. The room was huge, with air-conditioning, a full kitchen and a balcony. The bathroom was large, with a soaking tub and walk-in shower. Our room was located on the side of the building, so we actually had a view of the ocean and a view of the city. We only ate breakfast at the hotel restaurant, but it was an extensive buffet and very good. The hotel is 1 block from the beach, with beach access directly in front. If you are going to the beach, stop at the Concierge to pick up a beach bag with towels, fruit, and water on your way out. The staff was extremely polite and helpful. The maid service is amazing and the room was very clean. The valet parking service is good and well worth the convenience in downtown Waikiki. The hotel is located in a little quieter spot than many hotels in Waikiki. It is also a little easier to get in and out of town from this location, which is convenient for getting out of town and driving to the north shore or doing other sightseeing by car. You can walk to as much dining, shopping, and entertainment as you could possibly want.

The apartment was great, really comfortable and a nice outlook with contemporary fixtures. The hotel one street back from the beach. The hotel staff were a stand our. Super helpful and friendly. A few things that could be better... the pool area is really small and gets very windy. Not ideal if you have kids that want to spend all day in the pool. The gym is pretty pathetic. Few cardio machines and very limited weights and machines. For a hotel of this grade I think they could do a lot better. WIFI was slow and in some areas like the pool difficult to get a signal.

We stayed 4 nights at Disney Aulani prior to moving to this hotel & were concerned about how it would compare to our suite at Disney. Honestly, this hotel far surpassed our room at Aulani (and was $400 a night cheaper!)  We were greeted with leis, glasses of ice water, warm wash cloths and smoothies at check in. The room was amazing.  Loved having 2 bathrooms, 3 tv's, a washer/dryer and fully equipped kitchen. The view was awesome & worth the extra money.  Every staff member we encountered was so helpful. One day, we took the car out to drive to Pearl Harbor.  It was a hot day and without asking, the valet guys brought us bottled water for the drive.  Another day, we took a walk on the beach in the morning and it started to rain.  They noticed we were wet when we got to the valet area & gave us towels. Much appreciated.  Didn't eat at the restaurants or use the pool, so I can't comment on those.

Pros:
- Suite is spacious with full set kitchen, washer and dryer, and amenities
- Staff is friendly and helpful
- Great location to the Waikiki beach, even though not direct access

Cons:
- The room I stayed in had a moldy smell in the living room, akin to that smell when a room has not been occupied for a long time.
- Bathroom and carpet could have been cleaner.
- Master bathroom did not have a door, the shower area did not have a door, so it was always drafty after a shower.

When we went up to check in they asked if we were celebrating anything special.  My husband told them we had never been to Hawaai, and we were celebrating our 33rd Wedding anniversary.  They were so kind, they upgraded us to a suite.  When we walked in, it was breathtaking.  It was a fully loaded condo.  Best of everything including washer and dryer.

I felt safe, and spoiled.  Dean and the staff made this our best vacation we have ever had.  Thank all of the staff and Dean for the royal treatment.

We were delighted to be upgraded to a lovely 2-bedroom suite on the 34th floor with the most incredible views of the ocean and cityscape.  There was a fully equipped kitchen (including a wine fridge!), dining room, living room, two full baths, washer/dryer and more than enough room for the four of us!  

Like our previous trip, we received wonderful service from the valet and greeters, to reception and concierge.  It's apparent that management wants to please their guests, and takes all reviews seriously.  I mentioned in my previous review two years ago that we requested a pillow top for our mattress and a roll away bed to replace the sleeper sofa.  As we were checking in this year, the receptionist noted (without my asking) that our two beds were pillow top and the sleeper sofa was memory foam.  Wow, that's attention to detail!

We stayed a total of 8 nights and enjoyed every moment.  This year, we decided to spend more time at the beach than the pool, and it was just a quick stroll across one street and down a short walkway.  We discovered Steak Shack, which is a really delicious and inexpensive lunch located at the end of that walkway.  (Tip: Be sure to take cash for Steak Shack, and their lunch is usually under $10 per person.)  

You can rent chairs right there if you'd like and sit on the beach.  However, we preferred to make a right turn and walk a little way to find a grassy area with palm trees and lovely views of the ocean. With the towels, waters and fruit Trump Hotel provides, we could spend hours in or out of shade watching all the paddle boarders.  It's a lot of fun, if you've never tried it!  You can rent paddle boards, kayaks, etc., and there are stands where you can order a beer and/or mai tai to enjoy as you relax.  When you head back to the hotel, be sure to use the shower / sprayer directly on the hotel's property.  It's a little hidden in the shrubbery next to the drive, but super convenient!

The location of the Trump Hotel is awesome with every convenience you could need nearby - Starbucks, ABC store, casual and upscale restaurants and shopping.  You can easily walk all over Waikiki, and we did!  As a last note, we called the reception desk the morning we were to check out to let them know we had a late flight - 9pm.  They allowed us to stay in our room until 6pm so we could enjoy our last day and shower before heading to the airport.

The BLT steakhouse is by a landslide the best restaurant in all of Waikiki. The only criticism I can really think of for this hotel would probably be a bigger pool and hot tub.

They made me feel so special from the moment we got out of our car.  They greeted us with leis made from island shells.  They were beautiful!  Then they gave us water fused with fruit and a washcloth was brought to us on a silver platter that was dipped in lemongrass to freshen up with.  It felt so good and smelled wonderful!  We were greeted that evening with a knock at the door and were presented with a box of cookies that were shaped in pineapple and made in Hawaii.  They were very good!  We were celebrating a 50th birthday and a 65th wedding anniversary.  The Anniversary couple were presented with a bottle of champagne and chocolates.  The birthday girl was given a small cake.  They had made a mistake on her birthday card and put 60 instead of 50.  When she called to let them know they gave her 2 boxes of those yummy pineapple shaped cookies.  The hotel had everything stocked that we could dream of from toiletries (including sugar scrub and body butter that was wonderful!)  We also were stocked every night with ""trump"" water and whenever we would leave for a trip the valet people would always give us water for the road.  My mother, who is 88 and uses a walker, was given a room that was handicape  access but she still could not get up from the toilet.  When we let them know, they sent an engineer right away and he switched out the toilet for her!! How amazing is that? Our suite was wonderful and stocked with a full size kitchen.  After cooking breakfast, we left and when we returned, our kitchen was cleaned including the dishes and they were put away! I did not want to leave this place.  I would highly  recommend this place to everyone.  The infinity pool is small but very relaxing and the help came around with coconut sorbet to try and it was soo refreshing.  The hotel is close to everything but just away enough from the hustle.  You can be there but get away too.  Beautiful park and beach right outside the door.

We'd stayed in the Maldives a few holidays ago and have since found ourselves searching for that 'next level' experience, to no avail.  Enter Trump waikiki. 

How?  Personal service (you're always addressed by your name), guest comes first mentality and nothing is too much trouble. 

You're greeted with valet parking, leis and a hostess with chilled and scented face towels, just a taste of what's to come.  You check in.  If they can upgrade you, check you in early.....  no need to ask, they'll do it.  They want to exceed your expectations. 

Your hostess will then give you a short tour of the hotel, after which you're escorted to your room.  The amenities are explained and i love that they emphasise, if you need anything, don't hesitate.  They even told us not to wash the dishes, house keeping will take care of that. 

Our children were made to feel special with mini robes, slippers, toiletries and a take home teddy. 

The rooms themselves are excellent. Our two bedroom suite had ocean views, a lovely kitchen with wine fridge, two lavish marble bathrooms, luxury toiletries (bath salts, sugar scrub etc).

The hotel pool is an infinity pool, and while on the smaller side, its perched over the street with views of the beach, worlds away from anywhere. 

The gym is adequate, with special little touches like cold towels, lemon water and free fruit. 

For trips to the beach, stop at the concierge for a beach bag with towels, water and a snack.  They also have boogie boards and surf boards for guest use. 

We did not try breakfast, as this is at an additional cost and there are many restaurants within walking distance.  We did indulge in a 9pm dinner one night.  It was one of our best meals in Hawaii and what's more, everything is half price after 9. 

So does the hotel have any shortcomings? The location is excellent, but not beachfront.  Parking is valet only.  The hair dryers are awful.  No mini bar, the pool could be bigger, the gym could have a better view and the accommodation could have be cheaper.  

Nonetheless, the everything else is so positive that these small imperfections are inconsequential. Furthermore, the things that made our stay special could be easily replicated elsewhere, with little expense.  We've stayed in similarly priced hotels that just don't compare. 

So, if travelling to waikiki, put this place on your 'must stay' list, not just a hotel, it's an experience.","Date of stay: June 2017","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Everything went fine until the day we checked out.  We had some time before our departing flight so we down to the cafe for their buffet breakfast.  About 20 minutes into the breakfast, while our family was still eating, the server put down the bill and said ""whenever you're ready.""  I looked around to see if there might be a lot of people waiting for a table, but I didn't see anyone waiting, and there were 4-5 vacant tables so I just put the bill aside and continued to eat.  

After we finished our plate of food, the server took away both the plates and the silverware but didn't replace with another set.  I had to ask the server twice to get another set of silverware.  I felt that the server was rushing us to leave but with a few empty tables around us I wasn't sure why.  

When we were still eating, the server came again and asked if we had signed the bill and if he could take it.  I confronted him and asked him if there was a reason for him to rush us like that.

Thanks to this level of service, our family vacation ended on such unhappy note.  With so many other hotel options in Honolulu, I will advise my friends going to Honolulu to opt for other hotels.","Date of stay: June 2017","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_20"

I've stayed in numerous hotels in Waikiki and so far, nothing beats the Trump.  Once you arrive, it'll feel like your little home away from home.  Every staff member we encountered was always so friendly and willing to help in any way.  They really make you feel like family and it was nice to know that every year the staff always remembers our family.  I love that every room, even the studios, has a kitchenette or full kitchen.  So very convenient for all the leftovers from eating out every day and when you have a young family with you, all the snacks you need to keep for the kids.  The hotel is perfect for both couples and families.  All the times we've stayed I've never heard a peep from any of our neighbors.  The rooms are always so clean and housekeeping is always so friendly.  This is one of the few hotels I let my kids walk barefoot in!  I do have to say that during this most recent stay the lanai furniture was pretty dirty which was unexpected.  My daughter loved sitting out on the lanai and would always come back inside the room with her clothes covered in black dirt.  Other than that, our latest stay was still perfect.  There's not many hotels in Waikiki with no resort fees, gives free beach bags daily, free wifi, free use of the computers in the business center, free water upon request, the list goes on!  I can't wait to come back again next year!","Date of stay: June 2017","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The second I found out I forgot the wallet, I immediately made a phone call to the hotel. Housekeeping was friendly and said they would look for me and email me once they find it. After 6 hours when I landed in LA, there was no Email and so I called again. Housekeeping then told me THEY DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING in my room 2207, which is unbelievable. I clearly remember I placed the shopping bag inside which is a brand new Chanel wallet on the couch. I am pretty sure the shopping bag is BIG enough and it CAN'T BE POSSIBLY IGNORED!

Whoever is in charge of the staff training at this hotel is to be commended. Also, one of the things I appreciated MOST about my stay was their offer to let us use a “hospitality room” after we checked out, because we had a late flight out of Honolulu. So, we checked out of our suite at the appointed time, but we were able to move to a small room where my family members could take a shower after being at the beach all morning. What an AWESOME gesture. Thank you and THANK YOU. Will definitely come back and will recommend to everyone. The only TINY thing that I didn’t like is that the pool is tiny. Tiny!

After spending 3 nights at the Kahala my husband and I were very excited to move to Trump International Waikiki, a place that was once very special to us. 

Upon check in, we were told that because there is such a low occupancy in the owners suites managed by the hotel, they would like to offer a one bedroom ocean view suite to us for $50 a night plus taxes. My husband I found it really odd and confusing at this point. Usually front desk upsell does not happen at a 5 star hotel and if it has to be done, it's usually done in a tasteful manner, not telling your guests that the hotel is not doing very well and ask them if they would like to pay more for an empty room. That's tacky.

We had originally booked a partial ocean view studio directly through Trump's website and thought we could use the washer and dryer in the suite so we took the upgrade. After entering the suite, there is no usual amenities like the welcome card and cookies. The room seemed strangely empty, like we've entered an airbnb, not a hotel room. Then we noticed the extremely worn out carpet in the bedroom and the water stains. We thought to ourselves, maybe it's just normal wear and tear. When we spoke to the guest relations manager, she insisted  that the hotel is fully booked right now and she has no idea why we were told it is quite empty at check in. She had no interest in finding out what happened or do any followups. She came up to the room, gave us 2 breakfast vouchers as apology and called it a day. 

On our last night at around midnight, the bathroom ceiling in the bedroom started leaking water. At first there was a lot of water coming out so the bathroom is flooded with water. Called the front desk right away and they sent maintenance people up. After 15 min they decided that it's the broken tub with overflowing water on the unit right above us that caused the leak and we were asked to move to another room past midnight. I'm sure this is not the first time it has happened given the water stain on the carpet and how damaged it is. 

Seems to me like the hotel is totally comfortable on upselling  their repeat customers rooms that can't be sold with problems. And then brush you off when there is a problem. It's really a shame because we used to love this hotel a lot but from now on I will be taking my business to the new RC.","Date of stay: June 2017","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_20"

They call you by name each time you approach the desk, room was immaculately clean, and EVERYONE smiled and acknowledged your existence. This was our second stay at the Trump, and it was even better than the first time.

Reviews that were not so favorable,  I thought, were due to just people's regular complaints.  I really wanted to believe that we were coming to a great five star hotel....   
Well, a five star hotel should not be telling the guest that they should upgrade the room for $160 a night, if we need handicap accessible room.
A five star hotel should not have a mildew smell every  you walk into your room.
A five star hotel should not have a washer in the room that smell so bad( the hotel could not resolve the issue, so it had to do our laundry for us).
A five star hotel should not bring a shower chair that is so dirty with molds.
A five star hotel should not have a closet with 8 hangers and no drawers for a room that is advertised to sleep 5 people.
A five star hotel should not have sofa beds that are so thin and lumpy.
A five star hotel should not hire workers who can't smile.
The list can go on for a while but many other reviews have mentioned them so I am going to stop here.
All in all, I can't say it was a pleasant experience to be at this hotel.
I am also glad that I was able to go to Montage in Maui after Trump, Now, that was a real five star hotel!

Valet parking very efficient but expensive (as was the case with most hotels in the area). The highlight had to be the staff who were geared to help at all times and were proactive. My wife left her sunglasses at the pool and Todd in the pool service area managed to track us down and return them. This was typical.  I would have to say, of all the hotels I have ever stayed at, this one was the winner in terms of service.

Only negative I can come up with was the small size of the pool if the kids are teens. It is perfect for young kids as there are shallow areas for them. My wife did manage to swim laps but I could see it getting crowded at times.

Hotel room is very spacious and the washroom size and layout is super. Customer service is exceptional and very prompt. Kitchen is fully stocked and ideal for traveling with kids. We typically had breakfast in the hotel.

Great location with 5 minute walk from the beach and Fort DeRussy Beach Park where there is paved boardwalk towards the Hilton Hawaiian Village Hotel. Also close to restaurants on beach walk (We tried Arancino, Shingen, Ginza Bairin, Henry's place (ice cream/sorbet), food trucks)

Some recommendations/FYIs:
- Go to the larger ABC store by Denny's on Lewer's Street
- bottled water is complimentary and no limits
- Grab a beach bag at the concierge before heading to the beach, sand toys are available for kids
- Catch the sunset or sunrise at the hotel pool
- Walk to the beach on Friday nights for the Hilton Hawaiian Village Fireworks (starts at 7:45pm)
- Late checkout is available and complimentary and we notified the front desk early on so they could accommodate

The hotel pool is small but I found it sufficient for us and never crowded. There is also a small Jacuzzi.","Date of stay: May 2017","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Location is absolutely outstanding, and the hotel itself is rather new and immaculately kept and maintained. Our room was excellent - slightly smaller than what I would normally expect from a 5* hotel however I gather this is not particularly uncommon in Honolulu. 

The infinity pool was on the small side, but the view is outstanding and the pool bar offers delicious cocktails - the Mai Tai in particular was the best we found anywhere in Honolulu.

The real star of the show was the service - particularly the concierge desk. Every staff member we dealt with from arrival to departure were consummately professional, incredibly friendly and helpful to a fault.

Breakfast was awful, swimming pool was small you don't feel like you are in a 5 star hotel at all ! 
Location not Great either , there was a night we ordered in room Dinning believe it or not when the food arrived the French fried was cold and soft ( ew) the cake we ordered smell the smell like that you have left in the fridge for weeks ( fridge smell ) not fresh ! So I rang ask them to change OMG the second time nothing better so we left the food in the front door! 
We walked  around look at other hotels we were so Regret stayed at Trump ! The worse 5 star hotel we have never been ! 
Am sorry but I couldn't say anything great about Trump hotel ! 
One thing not too bad for us was quite ( because we don't have kids ) I guessed  the reason the hotel was quiet because it's a boring hotel not in good location either , So people won't bring their family there ! 

I recommend Moana Hotel or Halekuni hotel ! We went to both hotel for lunch dinners and afternoon tea was perfect !

The general 5 star standard of this property is above anywhere else we stay.

Travelling with kids, we always end up meeting lovely families from all parts of the globe around the pool. 

Our special thanks will always go to Julia, who will always greet you with a welcoming, aloha and warm smile, and also to Dean, who seems to take such pride in his position, treating us very warmly as well. 

Our 9 year old daughter is always made to feel like she is extra special! 

Thanks Trump Waikiki! Wouldn't consider anywhere else in Waikiki","Date of stay: April 2017","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The hotel is directly behind Outrigger Reef. 

On arrival we were greeted by staff and checked in, very nice and smooth check in, the staff were very helpful and friendly. We had a basic ocean on the 13th floor with views overlooking the park and the public beach. The room has a small kitchenette with fridge, Microwave oven, sink. Large ensuite with tub and separate shower, its a single room with a very comfy king bed, TV and sofa lounge, with a smallish balcony. It ticks all the boxes. 

The pool area is smalish with a very nice edge pool, there are a few nice restaurants, steak, Sushi and breakfast area next to the pool. 
This hotel can be very suited for the family traveller who want to buy their food to save on eating out, the hotel also offers the shopping service to stock your unit for all the items you need. 

The service is by far the best we have experienced in Hawaii, most larger Hotels in Waikiki the service is fairly average, they are normally very busy where sometimes you feel like your a number, where this hotel is more like the better mainland hotels and they go out of their way to help or assist. 

The Pros on this Hotel is the service and self contained type of room, its still fairly central to the shopping, restaurants, and a few minutes walking distance to the beach. 
Cons, you are not right on the beach, with the overlooking the sand and sound you may want to experience if you stay in Waikiki.","Date of stay: April 2017","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Not on the beach but very close and very central for all the good restaurants in the area with a starbucks opposite. The Hotel provides you with a cooler bag with water, fruit and a towel each trip to the beach for free.

The only negative i have is the pool is extremely small and generally swamped by small children. And breakfast is on the expensive side.

Most everyone you'll meet working at this hotel is a genuinely nice person; which is really saying something because in the hospitality industry many people are nice only because they are looking after their own interests and avoiding trouble. For instance, I had feedback for the concierge regarding a tour recommendation. The concierge heard me out and I expected that to be the end of it, as it was at so many other places I've stayed. Instead I had a letter delivered to my room referencing points I had made in the conversation and stating that the team was going to discuss and improve certain tour recommendations for future guests based on my feedback. In another instance I had made a request of the hotel and there was a bit of a delay before the request was fulfilled. I had presumed that the hotel had just been unusually busy at the time and made no further inquiry of it; however a manager, unasked, had reviewed the hotel's internal records and found the delay unsatisfactory. Again I had a letter delivered apologizing along with a generous compensation for any inconvenience. My advice to travelers is to recognize the wealth of insight that each person working at the hotel will have as I had questions for nearly everyone there. When you are also friendly and engaging your own experience will be immeasurably enhanced, as you are the one who must invite the dialog. There were guests who routinely treated the people here like they treat apps, here's what I want and let me know when it is ready. One cannot help but feel sorry for these people as they have tripped over their own shoelaces without knowing it... Aesthetically Trump Waikiki is gorgeously designed and the spaces are inviting along with pleasant use of color. The beds are just right and unlike at most hotels where it takes a night or two to get used to the bed, I had no trouble falling asleep. Having both a shower and tub along with dual sinks is also a nice touch. Room with a balcony and at least a partial-ocean view is recommended. Space is adequate for living in and luggage. The air-conditioner is well balanced, enough to keep you cool but also not so much that you'll wake up dehydrated at night. Transportation from and around the hotel is easy and it's five minutes or less to the beach. The buffet at In-Yo in the mornings is not to be missed, and the Mai Tai at Wai'olu Lounge is truly as is claimed, the world's best. Make your reservations now and you'll thank me for this advice later.","Date of stay: March 2017","Trip type: Traveled with friends","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We reserved a two bedroom oceanfront suite, which featured expansive views of the ocean, as well as the Honolulu skyline. Service was excellent throughout; when we requested the king bed to be split into two twins for my children, they were happy and graciously willing to accommodate my request. A late checkout of 3 pm was also given, of which I was really pleased, as well as impressed with the service. Breakfast at the In-Yo cafe was wonderful, with a variety of offerings on the buffet and the a-la-carte menu. We stayed at the Trump Waikiki for one night in order to have a ""home base"" per say, while we enjoyed many of the attractions in the Honolulu Area, including Pearl Harbor and the Diamond Head Hike (we were staying on the other side of the island). However, I would not recommend booking this property for more than 2-3 days. It is a hotel, not a resort, and therefore does not have sprawling grounds and lush gardens. It does not have direct beach access, and the pool (while very pretty) is quite small.

If this is number one the others must be awful. I actually have stayed in 'the modern' and found it much better and staff way more attentive.

The trump hotel is very much geared for the Japanese tourism market it seems - down to fancy electronic loo seats and deep baths to a very japanese inspired menu. That's all well and good but many of the staff struggled to understand us speaking English - I mean really isn't Hawaii an English speaking country. We had problems communicating to staff.

We also had to call to get our room cleaned because service was so slack. It's like they had forgotten us.

Also the first room we got out in had a shower over a very deep bath that was difficult to get into with out hitching your leg right up. I had a double hip replacement 8 months ago and thus is not easy for me and is something I would only expect  from a very low star hotel not a five star. To be fair when I raised this they did move me to a better room but we're going to charge for the privilege had we not emphasised my disability and this not being of the expected standard.

We had just come from 'four seasons' in Ko Olina which is superior on every level - customer service, rooms, staff, ambience and facilities. 

I felt the trump hotel was more of a business mans hotel - somewhere just to lay your head for the night - not somewhere to have a holiday experience.  I suggest the management could do with checking into the four seasons for a few days to pick up some much needed tips.

My sister got married on March 25th (off property) so we decided to go all out and make it memorable for her special day. We decided to book a Premium 3 Bedroom - Ocean Front Suite for ONE-night so that the bridal party could all get ready on her big day. From Friday night to Saturday afternoon, it was truly amazing and my family and i want to thank the entire trump ohana for making this possible. From front service to room service to front desk to housekeeping, everything was just simply luxurious. All we had to do was worry about getting ready, our make-up/hair dressers, valet and front service took care of them and sent them up right away, our photographers same thing. This room was PERFECT to get ready in, the VIEW was breathtaking so of course we took wedding photos here. 

As we left the hotel we stopped at front desk so that my sister could take a few photos and the employees just offered so much help. Leaving the hotel we didnt get to thank each person who had helped us in making my sisters' day that much special.

We were celebrating my anniversary , my mom's 70th and daughter's 18th birthdays and were pleasantly surprised at check in with an upgrade to an oceanview (instead of the city view) 1 bed room suite which gave us so much more room than I expected.  My room was 2908 and had a great view of the ocean and gave us an extra full bath and extra sitting area with a second pull out sofa so all five of us had PLENTY of room to spread out.  The housekeeping staff was great, accommodating what we asked for quickly.   I could go on forever so here is what I really enjoyed :

-friendly and professional staff all around every department.  
-the free insulated beach bag stocked with water bottles, fruit, and towels for use of the day .  no need to bring your bulky beach bag from home.
-washer and dryer in the room with detergent and Bounce ready for you
-full size kitchen if you choose to cook and a dining table and an island with bar stools
-location is perfect to me: close to great shopping, restaurants and the fun festivals that take place in waikiki.  
-it's not a hectic hotel like others.  It's big but does not feel like a zoo when you come and go out the front door
-I'm telling everyone about how pampered we were and the staff of the hotel made my trip to Oahu one of the best  experiences ever on vacation.
-do the comparison.  For a little more than some chain hotels, you will get a lot more!  I was hesitant about visiting Oahu but my stay here was perfect and I'd go to other islands only if there was a Trump Hotel there.","Date of stay: March 2017","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

They could however do better with the bedsheets. They did feel a bit like sandpaper and not the most comfortable sheets that we are used to at other hotels. 

Service is excellent and unparalleled. Housekeeping is on point and we've never have to ask or call for anything except for to go coffee cups. From the moment we arrived to when we left, we were given the utmost attention. 

It is centrally located and we were able to walk everywhere. Even though we had a rental car, we preferred walking. Driving was a bear!

What we liked: the staff was friendly and helpful, but not any more so than you would expect for the price.  The location is good, probably primarily for locals who aren't so interested in going to Waikiki beach, which is quite a bit of a hike.

What we didn't like:  there were a lot of small flaws, which listed individually would sound like nitpicking, but collectively very much detracted from the experience.

We were fortunate to receive an upgraded partial ocean view one bedroom suite on a high floor.  Partial ocean view meant a good ocean view not just a peek and we were delighted.  We love the quiet privacy and the beautiful rooms, the fully featured Toto automatic toilet, great well equipped kitchen and the views of course.  Housekeeping service twice a day is really appreciated.  We needed to have access to a computer, printer, and scan services for work and all were easily accessible at no charge.  Small but important things.  The bellmen were prompt with retrieving the car and the phones were always answered on the first ring.  We enjoyed the pool and the In Yo breakfast buffet.  Only a block from the beach and close to world class retail and restaurants, this place is hard to beat for location.  Waikiki is undergoing a tremendous transformation to a world class destination.  It's one of our family's favorite places to stay and we look forward to returning.","Date of stay: February 2017","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Our intent was to have a special trip for my elderly mother whose mobility is now limited and cannot travel much.

Location – Close to the heart of Waikiki.  We were worried about the distance to the beach and ability to get there with a wheelchair.  The walk to the beach was very easy and it was actually similar in distance to the beach compared to some of the Towers at the Hilton Hawaiian which are portrayed as beachfront.  Tip – rental for umbrella  and 2 lounge chairs at beach is $30 for the entire day if you go pay before 9 am (look for the yellow ones, best priced).

Service – Every single staff member is well trained in guest service.  All five of us were impressed with the level of service and support.  We did have one issue which was crucial to us.  The lift for the pool area was not working due to a storm the evening before we arrived.  After a few days, we expressed our disappointment and frustration with the length of time to get it repaired.  Chris Slorez from the restaurant and pool area went out of his way to push building engineering to get it fixed same day and also advised management of the undue delay.  We received an apology call the next day directly from the Hotel Manager Scott Dirks.  It was not just lip service, the empathy expressed was very genuine, a real class act!  He went out of his way to make amends for our lost pleasure time (likely the first and last trip for my elderly mother to Hawaii).  The positive actions taken by Scott made it all ok in the end.  I have travelled around the world (Barcelona, Lisbon, Dubai, London, Venice, Madrid, Caribbean, Mumbai, Nairobi) and I can state confidently that the service at Trump Waikiki was second-to none and certainly much better than other Waikiki hotels we have stayed at before.  This hotel stands out as a five star due to the exceptional service.

Amenities – Pool was about 10ft by 90 ft, warm with a decent size hot tub.  Perfect for adults and toddlers maybe a bit small for kids in their teens.  Pool area is fully accessible with a special lift. Great restaurant and SPA as well.  High quality beach bag filled with towels, cold water bottles and an apple and orange available at anytime through the day which we found to be extremely helpful.  No issues in getting extra supplies unlike other hotels.  Concierge is very helpful and knowledgeable.  We worked with Crystal Nichols and she would go out of her way to make additional calls or look into alternatives to get us the most optimum solutions, extremely professional and very approachable!

Room – Superb, very spacious, could easily sleep six and more if you wish to ask for a cot.  Quality all around, kitchen was fully equipped and they added specific utensils we asked for, walk in showers were great and properly accessible per our needs, good view of beach area with a lounge chair and table/chairs on two balconies, free wifi which worked well with no issues at all.

We will gladly stay here again.","Date of stay: February 2017","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The check-in time is 4pm, a little frustrating when you are coming from Australia and land early morning but the desk does their best to get you in beforehand.    I had room 2301 which I loved.  The room was large facing the city and had a great bathroom and kitchenette.  The bed was really comfortable, there is a pillow menu so you can sleep more comfortably and the air conditioning worked well.  My room was always cleaned well by very friendly housekeepers and the extra amenities were everything I appreciate in a good 5 star hotel (Mouthwash, complimentary water, toothbrushes).  The shower was great, it had good pressure and you can just walk in it rather than it sitting over a bath tub.  The bath tub itself looked deep and a lot of fun but I am not really a bath person.  All the staff were lovely, attentive and an asset to the hotel.

We decided on this property because of the comments others have shared. We arrived on Jan.20 at 10 pm for 2 weeks and was greeted by Sierra at the front desk. Amazing attitude and personality she had and made us feel special as guests. ( Thanks Sierra ) We were upgraded to a 1 bedroom partial ocean view room # 2908. The room was awesome and had all amenities plus extras. Having a full kitchen including washer and dryer does have its benefits. Room was cleaned twice a day including kitchen centre. The view was awesome to wake up to every morning.  The staff always greeted us with smiles and were always making sure we were taken care off or if we needed anything.This property is impeccable and well located. Beach is minutes away and shops are the same. Pricing is on the high side but you get what you pay for and its Waikiki... everything is expensive. Little things like beach bag filled with fruit and water or refreshments served at the pool just to list a few all complementary. We also asked for a late checkout since our flight was leaving late in the evening and they accommodated us more than expected. Thanks again Sierra.

It not directly on the beach however a 5 minute walk (300mm) and you are right at the public beach.  Beach it's self is well maintained safe with friendly guests, however it's nothing to compare what Island has to offer. So if you are looking for a ideal beach hotel this is not it. 

However what we did love about the hotels is overall quality and experience.  Transportation was provided from airport to hotel and we were greeted by friendly staff. Our room wasn't ready yet since we came before the check in time, however all of our luggage was secured and we were escorted to a bar/restaurant with an amazing view and free drinks were provided. 

Our room was absolute perfection which can be compared to luxury 1 bedroom apartment. Also to keep in mind stay was $600 per night however given it's honeymoon, peak season and the best view, perfection was meet. 

Location was ideal since it was located near all restaurants, beach, and ideal nigh time walkway where everything is happening at once.  Price does seem high however quality is there and if you are looking for a memory that will last without any negative neglects I would recommend this hotel. 

Ideal for couples, honeymoon and kids.","Date of stay: September 2016","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

When we expressed interest in extending our stay they were most gracious in finding ways to make it affordable. 
At every turn, it was hello Mr. and Mrs. Layman, may we help you with anything. Timothy, at the front desk, went out of his way several times for us.

The service was of a level that you rarely experience these days, regardless of how much you pay.  The concierge desk in particular were outstanding.  Nothing was ever too much trouble.

The only downside is you are not right on Waikiki beach - it is only a block walk, but then you don't get to the best part of the beach.  However, that is something I would willingly sacrifice for the quality of the rooms and the service that you get at this hotel.","Date of stay: January 2017","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We looked at renting a house, but couldn't find one w/o stairs available on our dates.  Then talked to both this hotel as well as the Outrigger across the street about multi-bedroom suite options & this hotel's 3 bedroom suite seemed our best bet, so we went with it.  For what we paid, however, the hotel did not live up to its reputation.  It's very nice & the staff certainly are wonderful, but there were too many little things that added up to a way over-priced stay.  BTW-it's also important to note that this is one of those properties that is paying Donald Trump for the use of his name; despite what he has claimed publicly, he does NOT 'own' it.

Upon arrival the guest is greeted by staff with a lei (my first, after all my trips to Honolulu) of either yellow shells (women) or kukui nuts (men) & then escorted up to the lobby check-in which is actually on the 6th floor.  Bags were delivered promptly by staff, though just placed inside the door vs. into the bedroom-bellman clearly wanted a tip, but sorry pal-if I have to shlep them into the bedroom, the tip stays in my pocket.

We were on the 30th floor, so very little road noise, unless we had the doors or windows open.  Very little noise from the hall, either, but that could be because we were at the end of the hall & our entry way served as a buffer.

Beds were a huge disappointment-beds at a Marriott or Renaissance or even across the street at the Embassy Suites are much better, in our opinion.  To their credit, staff did actually switch out the mattress' in 2 of the rooms (albeit the wrong mattress in one of the rooms, but that's a different issue), but still a disappointment & still very uncomfortable.

Bathrooms are lovely, but as others have pointed out, showers lack doors/curtains which means water does go everywhere.  Interestingly, not a single towel rack or hook in sight (other than one over the toilet for a hand towel), though there is certainly room for it.  Wonderful, giant (huuuge, as someone would say!) bath sheets, but ended up hanging it over the bathroom door as there was nowhere else to hang it.  Shower head & caddy are very nice, but definitely aimed at someone verrrrry tall & this from a person who is 5'7.  Hotel branded toiletries are clearly geared towards men-took one whiff & closed the bottle back up; made me glad I had brought my own things! Tubs looks very inviting, but since none of us were 12 years old, or had the agility of a 12 year old, we didn't attempt to use them, especially since there were no grab bars or step stool to get in/out of them anywhere.  Same w/the showers-not a single grab bar in sight which is a problem for anyone w/even the slightest mobility or balance issue.

Upon arrival we discovered that the AC for the suite wasn't working properly-had several hotel engineers up multiple times & eventually they got it straightened out.  However, while closing the drapes in the living room, to help keep the sun out, discovered a very large tear in one of the shears.  Showed it to the housekeeping supervisor who came up to check on things & while she said she'd have it replaced the next day, it was still there a week later when we left.  Very surprising, not a single ceiling fan in the place & this is Honolulu where there are ceiling fans just about everywhere!  Would have certainly helped w/air circulation.  Coffee pot provided didn't work well w/the coffee packets provided-hotel staff promptly switched it out for another, albeit noisier, model that we were able to make work.  Fixtures & fittings in the kitchen very nice, otherwise-certainly higher caliber than one would expect to find in a hotel, at least for the cutlery, dishes were Corel ware, which was also surprising.

Since there were only 3 beds in the suite, we ended up asking for a rollaway for one of our party.  Noisiest mattress we have ever heard!  Not sure what it's made of, but there has to be something better out there!  

Housekeeping comes twice/day, including turn down service at night (no chocolates, though, unlike several Westin's I have been in).  They are absolutely wonderful people-can't say enough good things about them!

Pool is verrrrrry small &, as others have noted, easily over-run due to the size.  Hot tub is actually surprisingly large or maybe just looks that way next to the small pool.

Wifi, while complimentary, is verrrrrry sloooooow & very annoying in that every device has to be reconnected every time you return to the hotel or wake up the device-and I thought Hilton's wifi was bad!

Did go to the spa for a massage (see commentary above re: poor beds-perhaps it's intentional to drive business to the spa?) & would absolutely go back, even if not staying at this property.  

Would we come back?  For the service, absolutely, & for the location, absolutely, but not sure about the rest, especially the beds.  We are just not willing to spend that kind of money & not be able to get a good night's sleep, especially when there are other options available.","Date of stay: January 2017","Trip type: Traveled on business","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

My husband and I stayed at the hotel in January with our 3.5 month old son. We selected this hotel based on other reviews touting it as a kid friendly hotel. I would have to agree. Upon arrival (which was past our son's bed time), we were able to check in right away and were pleasantly surprised to see that the room already had a wooden crib ready to go. The hotel also provided a baby bathtub (which is the exact same bathtub we have at home) and some J&J baby products (which we did not use). We also had a small fridge, a full sized sink (with dish soap), a tea maker - all of which came in handy to store, clean and warm up our son's bottles. The hotel needs a refresher on safe sleeping for infants as the crib came with bumpers resulting in a delay in getting our son to sleep while I tried to quickly untie the bumpers. On the day we checked out, we requested a hospitality room as our flight was not until the evening. We were provided a fresh new room, once again equipped with a crib, which was a very nice touch since we didn't want our son napping in a car seat or at the airport all day. The only downside was that the mattress in this crib did not meet the safe sleeping standards (it was way too small for the crib); however, we made do since we could keep an eye on him while he napped. 

We were also impressed by the staff (everyone from housekeeping to front desk, concierge and valet), which was always exceptionally friendly, efficient and ready to assist. The room was also very spacious and clean. The bidet was a nice touch. 

We tried using the pool a few times, but it's pretty much a bust. As other reviewers have mentioned, it is small, in the shade, full of rowdy little kids and overlooking an old building. So you don't have a view, it got a little cold at times and was not a great place to relax. However, we were more than fine heading to the beach which was just a short walk away. 

Overall, we were very happy with the hotel and would recommend it to others.","Date of stay: January 2017","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Three were my children and they are 5, 7 and 12 years old. We stayed at a premium two bedroom + den ocean view suite.  The room was a perfect size to accommodate all of us. There were bathrobes and slippers for us as well – yes including the children! The rooms are very clean and it came with a “full kitchen” – even with a rice cooker!!! And I sure did utilize the kitchen.  The beach is a 5 minute walk from the hotel. Before walking to the beach, my husband stopped by the Concierge who offered us beach bags filled with towels, water and fruit. The rooms and waking up every morning with the view of the ocean is amazing.
I found the hotel staff and the accommodation first class. The staff addressed us by last name every time they saw us. Everyone from the Doorman, Front Desk, Concierge, to the Servers of the restaurants, and Housekeeping were very attentive, extremely helpful, friendly and overall quality of service offered to us was definitely living up to the Trump Brand.  I wish I could remember everyone’s name!   I myself work at a hotel in guest services; providing the best quality of guest services is very important to me and I was very impressed by this hotel.

But the bed was too soft for either of our liking and we ended up sleeping on the sofa almost every night. Shower/tub combo wasn't very practical to get in and out of, but looking at other hotel photos, it seems they have other options based on the room selection. Valet pricing also a little steep. Overall it was a nice stay but I'm not sure that we'd return based on our personal preferences.","Date of stay: December 2016","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Never before have I taken the time to rave about a hotel on this site, but this one deserves it!! The staff, luxury suites, location, food & amenities - perfect! For those thinking about a Honolulu trip, I can't recommend this hotel enough.  If you're new to Honolulu, the beach front at other hotels is often busy-busy, and noise from the city core can often be heard...Not at Trump.  Their beach is just a block away and pristine.  It's also a short walk from the heart of Waikiki's shopping and dining area.  No car needed.  As for food and amenities, I enjoyed the most fantastic poke bowl one eve, followed with a buffet breakfast that was off the charts for freshness and variety.  Last, I enjoyed a 90-minute massage in the Spa.  Maria, my therapist, was SO good, I'd fly back just for her magic!! I could go on and on about this hotel.  And why I'll be going back next year indeed!","Date of stay: December 2016","Trip type: Traveled solo","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We took three apartments between the 10 of us and were all upgraded to ocean view rooms. The kitchens were really well fitted out with plates and cutlery for 10 people and a dining table for 6. (With the outdoor table added on, we sat 10 comfortably.)
The apartments had well appointed laundries with Bosch appliances, though the dryer was very slow to dry the clothes.
The bed was very soft for my liking, but I was happy with the pillow menu and arranged for a neck friendly pillow to be delivered to the room.
My only other gripe was the shower. The water pressure was very low.
Concierge was outstanding, recommending and booking restaurants and a private tour of the north shore. They were also extremely helpful and patient with our elderly parents.
We ate at the breakfast buffet most mornings. I loved how Danny, who worked the pans, remembered my order each morning, and our itinerary from the day before. (""How was the north shore?"") He was full of humour added a lot to the ambience of the restaurant.
Trump International is one block from the beach, so it is easy enough to walk down there and rent a chair and umbrella, but I did miss that I couldn't just wander down to a hotel beach and read my book in the shade.
The are too many restaurants to count in the blocks near the hotel, but having bills sydney 3 minutes walk away was a blessed relief. (Green breakfast bowl and a picollo latte anyone? And hubby was so happy to have sweetcorn fritters in Hawaii!)
The restaurant and bar at Tommy Bahamas is also a great place for a light fresh meal and just a few minutes away.","Date of stay: December 2016","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We headed to Trump International Towers and went to the bar area wich also has quite a great menu. 
Troy was our server, he greeted us warmly and engaged in conversation easily asking us if we had been here long or just arrived. we told him we just came in this was our first stop. He took our drink order and brought them to us in a very efficient time and brought us nuts. Brought us not only the bar menu but also the restaurant menu and we looked and made our choice. The food options were great. The edamame is great and so were the quesadillas. I think Troy was most engaging and very detail oriented and kind. We wound up going back our last night in Honolulu the 19th and once again he was working and when we walked in....what blew my mind and was most impressive was that he rememberd us by saying....Hi Olson's...welcome back, but it gets better, he said, Mrs. Olson...your stoli blue and club tall with lemon and water, Mr Olson, your longboard.....and I'll grab you some nuts....WOW.....thats excellent customer service and this is why, Trump Towers is our first stop when we get to Hawaii and our last stop before heading home....HIGLY IMPRESSIVE...We love too, the people who work there truly seem to like their jobs and have the utmost respect for anyone coming into that property, whether as a guest staying at the hotel or just coming for drinks and dinner....way to go Trump Towers and way to go Troy!","Date of stay: November 2016","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Big letdown. 

Although the staff is awesome, the hotel itself was not up to par. In our room we promptly reported the bathroom light that kept shorting out and wouldn't stay on. No one fixed it all 10 days. The tv cabinet had one part that wouldn't stay closed. My husband had to stick a piece of paper towel in it to keep it closed. 

The pool area must have been an after thought. Very small. Over 5 people and it was crowded. There is also no nighly entertainment as with the other hotels. We sat on the balcony and listened to the music the other hotels provided.

This hotel has no laundry facilities unless you upgraded to a suite at $150+ per night. To send your laundry out would have been the cost of an entirely new wardrobe. They did provide a beach bag with towels, water and fruit, but the bag needed to be returned.

The shower setup here was most unusual. No doors so water flies everywhere. We had at least 5 towels on floor with every shower. They do provide good toiletries daily.

As stated, the staff was awesome. The hotel was not. This was a once in a lifetime event for us.","Date of stay: October 2016","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Secondly, as good as the house keeping service was I found myself constantly saying can you come back in half an hour as it seemed as though they weren't leaving us alone for 5 minutes. I then ended up ringing down to reception to say please can you send them once a day only. The last thing would have been the trump protest which was held out the front of the hotel on 2 of the 3 nights I was staying there.

Room service arrived in under 15 minutes.

Concierge delivered what I needed in 10 mins maybe less.

All the staff were extremely helpful.

Beach coolers, towels, fruits and water were perfect to keep us happy on the beach of Waikiki.

Everyone is very nice and helpful.  Professionalism at its greatest!  The room we had was perfect.  Perfect sized kitchen with everything you need for a quick meal.  Comfortable bed, great shower and bath....  The location is in the heart of everything...  Easy beach access as well as walking distance to Starbucks, Roy's and fairly good size grocery store that you can buy anything you could imagine.   Bottom line is that EVERYTHING is within walking distance.  The Hotel also gives you a beach bag with water towel and an apple.  The hotel doesn't have any special areas reserved on the beach (like other posts referred to).  The best idea is to rent chairs and umbrella for $30.  The rental places are on the beach, the umbrella chair and table will have number or you put a reserved tag that they give you on the umbrella.  There is only Valet Parking available $30 a day if I recall.  I don't think there is any available ""free"" parking anywhere Waikiki.  To me this seemed more a business hotel.  If you are looking for a ""Hawaii resort"" type feel this isn't your hotel.  The pool is nice, sort of small and only a few chairs are actually in the sun. Very quiet atmosphere.  There is attentive service that can get you a drink or any food that you may want.  They have some type of Award Winning drink that they sell...  Wow.. its so good!  No swim up pool bar of any sort.  Again, its not that sort of hotel.  We stayed a full week at this hotel in October.  I just wish it had more of a Hawaii / Hawaiian feel.","Date of stay: October 2016","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

My wife chose the Trump. We had other members of the family staying at the Hilton. So we had a point of reference. The rooms 1 bedroom suite with den was absolutely brilliant and made what could have been a trying holiday, with young children, into a success. We all comfortably had enough space when needed to relax at the end of what were often long days. The rooms were incredibly comfortable and well appointed. Granted the pool is small, but hey your in Hawaii, it adequately served the purposed for a quick dip at the end of the day (the Beach was a two minute walkaway, albeit it was better to swim outside the Hilton because of the breakwater).

There are countless hotels that provide amazing amenities and have impressive design, but genuinely caring attitude and warm smile from the Trump associates are what completely separates this hotel from the rest. 

The lobby, being uniquely on the second floor with an open terrace is incredibly welcoming and 'private'. 

I had not seen such an impressive breakfast option (combination of Western & Japanese) outside of Asia and South America. While many hotels are cost conscious, it looks like Trump Waikiki puts guest experience at the forefront.

Nothing was too much trouble, the staff were friendly and always smiling.  Tim, who checked us in, greeted us by name each time he saw us (now that is a great memory!)  The Concierge staff were fantastic!  Being our first time in Hawaii, we asked them a lot of questions and nothing was too much trouble for them.

The room was AMAZING!  We got upgraded to a partial ocean view suite and it was just beautiful!  Beds were super comfortable, room was serviced twice a day, water delivered whenever you wanted it and we got a bottle of champagne for our honeymoon.

The location was perfect!  It is at the top of 'luxury row' so a very easy walk to the main shopping strip and still close to the beach.

When heading to the beach, concierge provided a bag with towels, fruit and water to take down there.

We had a sunset drink and dinner at the Wai'olu Ocean View Lounge.  According to their drinks menu they serve the Worlds Best Mai Tai, and I can attest to the fact that it really is!!  The food was also really great.

Overall, I would highly recommend staying at Trump International.","Date of stay: October 2016","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I've stayed at every 4-5 star hotel in Waikiki and for the money, the Trump beats all.  The rooms are the largest and newest.  The restaurants are the best and their staff is top notch.

By the second day everyone called me by name and went out of their way to provide service above what was expected.

On the last night I needed something beside a table at a resturant and another great meal so they allowed me to just camp out on the lounge sofa where the kitchen made a special pizza for me to have with a great bottle of wine.

Nothing is cheap in Honolulu and neither is any good hotel, but similar rooms at the others are more, the rooms are smaller and older and the service is one notch less.

There they pointed out some further amenities (pool, lounge, Lanai, etc) before dropping us off at reception. Check is was smooth and we were quickly on our way to our floor on the 23rd floor. On thing we noticed in the elevator is that a tone sounds as you pass each floor. I did not notice at first until my wife pointed it out, and if you're sensitive to that kind of thing, it might be annoying.

Our room was great and very spacious with a fully loaded kitchen that included everything you would need if cooking & dining is on your list of activities. They will even pre-stock your room if you so desire. There was a large sitting area with a comfortable couch and chair, and we had a king bed that looked out towards the balcony. The sliding door leading to the balcony is very heavy which I guess is out of necessity given the height of the floor and to avoid any accidents. We had a great combination of views that included the city, mountains and ocean. If not for the other buildings, we would have had a spectacular view of Diamond Head. 

The bathroom was highly appointed with a granite twin sink vanity, a deep soaking tub, tile shower and a lot of Trump spa products. The shower and tub are combined in the same area and there are no doors on the shower which I have never experienced before and I thought it was an interesting quark.

Even though the Trump is on the edge of Waikiki, the locating is really excellent. It is a very short walk to great shopping and dining on Beach Walk, Lewers St and Kalakaua Ave. Much of Waikiki is very crowded and congested, and to me the Trump seemed like a respite from all of that. We walked by/in/through several other properties in the area and they all were much more hectic then the Trump and I very much appreciated that. 

It is also a short walk to the beach, and that particular section was less crowded than the main portion of Waikiki. While the sand was great, the bottom in the water was very rocky.  The Trump offers very cool beach bags with towels, fruit and water which we took advantage of on multiple occasions. 

Like everyone else mentions, the pool and spa are small, but there is plenty of sun or shade to lounge in and the view is not bad. It is a nice setting, and I think because it is small it lends itself to a more laid-back atmosphere.

Overall, we really enjoyed our stay at the Trump and we will definitely stay again on our next trip to Honolulu.","Date of stay: September 2016","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The room was beautiful and spacious and easily accomodated 7 adults and 3 babies. The hotel itself is a pretty standard 5 star hotel, but what set the place apart were the staff and the service. View was magnificent. The maids came and serviced our room 3-4 times per day, and even helped with the dishes, leaving the place impeccable every time. The hotel amenities including unlimited bottled water and baby supplies including soap, wipes, etc. We foolishly bought 4 30 packs of water and hardly used any of it. The full kitchen and the laundry room were also invaluable over the course of a week. They also helped us organize mobility scooters for the disabled that traveled with us.

There were a few people that made our stay exceptional. Michiko the manager did everything in her power and truly went above and beyond to ensure our stay was excellent. Dean Y. (in the valet area) gave us several invaluable tips on how best to travel the island and saved us from making a few disastrous mistakes. Ron O. and the other bellman helped us back and forth throughout the week with our luggage and bags, and with our repeated assembly and disassembly of mobility scooters after two of our party got injured. Rarely have I met staff with such a genuine desire to make our stay the best it could possibly be.

The only lacking thing about the hotel may have been the pool. It's a bit small, view is slightly occluded by the outrigger. Although it's an infinity pool, there is a large glass barrier removing the ""effect."" If our kids were older we would've preferred a different pool.

That being said the wonderful things about our stay far outweighed that issue.

Heading to the beach, don't forget to collect your beach bag with towels, complimentary water and fruit. Hotel is situated within close walking distance to the beach, eateries and shops. If you fancy a walk before hitting Ala Moana shopping centre for some retail therapy, it takes about 15 mins. Looking for a good steakhouse, you only have to travel down the lift to BLT Steak where the food was delicious and the service was absolutely top notch! Thanks for a great stay - will definitely be back and hopefully for more than two days!","Date of stay: September 2016","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Extremely excellent service from the moment we stepped out of the taxi to check out of hotel. 

Very clean, spacious and modern hotel. We stayed in an ocean view suite which had a small kitchen which was handy for simple food prep for our two year old.

This hotel is a very short walk to Waikiki beach, through Sheraton hotel. It was nice that they provided beach bags, however they didn't tell us about this, we found this info on tripadvisor! We found the pool to be very small relative to the size of the hotel. 

The ONLY negative is that on our last morning we ordered a glass of milk for or toddler, as we had ran out of our milk from 7/11. They charged us $11USD for this ($7+$4 room service delivery and taxes). This is  ridiculously expensive and unnecessary. 

Fantastic hotel otherwise, a very modern, welcoming with a high level of service.","Date of stay: September 2016","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

After much researching, I decided on the Trump hotel for my husband's birthday. 
We were greeted with leis made with beautiful shells and escorted to the 6th floor lobby for check-in. (Yes, their lobby is on the 6th floor- a bit out of the ordinary but it was still convenient and functional). While we were checking in, I was complaining about the intense heat and how thirsty I was from sitting in the long shuttle ride, in horrific traffic from the airport. Moments later, the hostess provided us both with fruit infused ice cold water (it's the little things like this that make me happy). The check in process was seamless and we even received a complimentary upgrade to our room! 
Overall, we were both extremely satisfied with our stay at the Trump hotel. The room was beautiful, we had a partial ocean view, great room amenities and modern, sleek furniture. The kitchen even came in handy. Our fridge was fully stocked with drinks and snacks we purchased at local convenience stores and there was an ice maker built into the fridge. We spent a lot of times outdoors but we also appreciated being indoors on occasion, to just lounge around in the room and relax. 
We ate at all three onsite restaurants. Wai'olu has great food (especially sushi) and cocktails (gotta try their Mai Tai!), BLT steak was awesome (I had lamb chops, husband had steak), In-Yo cafe had a variety of breakfast food with heavy Asian/Japanese influence (I had two bowls of delicious rice porridge, then ate pancakes, LOL!)
The hotel is a quick one block stroll to Waikiki Beach. Restaurants surround the hotel from every angle...there's even a Starbucks across the street (Yay!) The staff at the hotel are so attentive, polite and nice. They really go out of their way to make guests feel welcome and special. The service is exceptional. Thank you to the Trump hotel for providing my husband with a complimentary birthday cake and for making our first trip to Hawaii a memorable and enjoyable one.

After searching like a maniac through all reviews and pictures, we settled for Trump but after our stay I realized it was one of the best decisions we made for and on this trip to Hawaii.

From the moment I pulled into the property, the service was spectacular. The valet and bell service we consistent throughout our week long visit with exceptional service. At times it would be very busy but they were willing to chat with us while we waited for our car to be brought around. 

Once we arrived, we were greeted with leis, freshing cool flavored water and a cold towel. The front desk were very kind and upgraded us to one bedroom with balcony and told us we had an hour wait till our room was ready. While we did not want to wait (who does?) within 5-10 minutes of waiting, the front desk attendant approached us and said our room was ready. 

The room was clean (#1 factor), modern and the bathroom was the best. I loved the double sinks and my mom loved the deep and large tub she soaked in every night after a long day of being on her feet from sightseeing. However, the best part was obviously the view. The balcony had partial ocean view which we loved because not only did we see the ocean but was also able to view the city lights at night. 

Kitchen was not used besides the microwave and fridge. The gym was small but had everything one needs to stay fit during vacation. The location was perfect because it was on Waikiki but since it was a block away from the beach it felt less touristy.

Overall, a great stay and I would highly highly recommend.","Date of stay: July 2016","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Pros
* Interior is great, rooms are clean, fresh, and modern
* Staff is excellent - from the reception, to the bar staff, to the breakfast staff. They were all helpful and professional.
* Service is great

Cons
* Pool is tiny - the view from the pool is lovely, but it is too small to sit at. Once you have 2/3 people in it, it is full. 
* There is no bottled water in the room...  There is a message that you can ask for it - but that's just extra hassle that you don't need (so we did not - but it urked us)
* The lanai furniture wasn't very comfortable. No lounge chairs or even seat cushions. Just chairs and a table for you to sit out and eat. 
* The view from our partial ocean view - was partial ocean - but mostly the hotel next door
* Its off the oceanfront, in the middle of busy roads - therefore its quite noisy (inside the room I felt like I was in New York not Hawaii). 

My guess is that the interior of this hotel is the best in the area, but I think that I would go for an ocean front, cheaper hotel in future.","Date of stay: July 2016","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Let me echo the other reviews by saying the customer service is superb.  I wasn't happy with the view for the first room we were given and I was permitted to move up to a higher floor without an additional cost. Aside from that, my pros are:
* I love the suites.  We had a Deluxe Suite, 1 Bedroom, Partial Ocean View which came with a full kitchen and a washer/dryer and our view, once we moved, was amazing (see pic attached).  The price of food in Oahu is ridiculous so this allowed us to cook a lot of our meals.  Mind you, the grocery store food is high as well but not nearly as high as the restaurants.
*  Location was great.  We were surrounded by shops, across from the beach and really close to the larger ABC store which provided all of our last minute needs.
*  This was the first hotel that provided EVERY toiletry item that I needed.  It came with a toothbrush/toothpaste and mouthwash, shower sponge and body wash, sewing kit, qtips, etc.  Great job in that area.
*  Hotel food was good.  We only ate at the breakfast buffet which was extremely pricey, but good.

Now for the cons, which for me outweighed the pros:
*  Pool was incredibly small.  Not really made for much lounging and relaxing so we left it for the kids.  What's funny is that you can see 2 other larger pools from other resorts from your view, and then once you look down at ours, its disappointing.
*  No entertainment.  There wasn't really a social entertainment area.  No outdoor live music like several of the other hotels provide, no guest contests, etc.  It's like its strictly made for eating and sleeping.  Any entertainment requires you to leave the hotel.
*  It's missing the Hawaiian atmosphere.  Aside from the lei we received when we arrived, there is nothing really there that echos Hawaii.  No Hawaiian music playing in the lobby or hallways, no Hawaiian decor throughout the resort, etc.  Again, you had to leave to feel like your in Hawaii.
*  The furniture in the suite was a bit outdated.  Not very comfortable at all and it was more of a golden corduroy material.
*  Long wait for elevators and no air conditioning in the hallways or elevators
*  The lanai furniture wasn't very comfortable.  No lounge chairs or even seat cushions.  Just chairs and a table for you to sit out and eat. 
*  Limited television selection.  If you want to spend a day indoors, your very disappointed with your entertainment options.  We had to go to redbox to rent movies as there was only one movie channel and it wasn't even a good one.
*  Turn-down service was pointless.  Typically you receive water by your bed, hotel slippers placed on either side of the bed and chocolates or some form of snack by or on the bed for turn-down.  Here they just turn down the covers and put the trump literature on your bed.
*  Having to ask for water.  They don't put bottled water in the rooms to conserve so you have to ask for it.  Those that drink bottled water are going to request it so why not have it in the room?  The waste is the same.  Speaking of that, there should be a way to recycle in the hotel.  Be it a separate recycling can in the room or at least a place to drop recyclables in the lobby.

If we had it to do over, we would have stayed somewhere else that offered a bit more on the premises.  This hotel was great for what it provided, but my main thing was the lack of entertainment and feeling that you were in Hawaii.  Ok other than that.","Date of stay: August 2016","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

When we got into our room, it felt really warm. We lowered the thermostat from 70 or so to 65, and it wouldn't go any lower.  We waited 24 hours, giving it time to cool down.  I know the room never actually reached 65, because at home, I keep my thermostat at 69-71 in the summer, and I get really cold if it goes to 68.  We called downstairs, and someone came up immediately, and explained that they lock the thermostat out at 65 to ""save energy"" (or money?), but that they would lower it to 60 for us.  We kept it on 60 for the rest of our stay, but I don't think the room ever got below 70.  We left Trump go to go a hotel on Maui, where the room was kept so chilly I actually turned the thermostat up a bit.  

Other than that, the room was fine.  We stayed in a studio.  It's worth it to book the Deluxe category rather than the Superior category, as the bathrooms in Deluxe are amazing.We booked city-view, and the view was lovely, we could see the ocean and part of Diamond Head.  

The staff here are really 5 stars.  They were all amazing.  Seriously.  World-class.  Everyone from the front desk staff to the restaurant staff to the valets.  Dean at the valet was especially helpful.  Everyday he asked us where we were going, and he immediately knew the best way to get there and provided additional information on the places we were visiting.  

While the hotel itself never felt crowded, the pool was a different story.  The pool was too small to accommodate all of the families who were there.  

I would recommend this hotel to couples on a romantic trip, during the OFF season.","Date of stay: July 2016","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

We were greeted by the gorgeous Julia and her serene hula sway. We were seated in the lobby and with warm Hawaiian style hospitality adorned with a shell lei. I am pretty sure there was a ukulele there somewhere. It was delightful with a chilled Island vibe. This set the tone and after a long trans Pacific flight (no, not US but Australia) this put us in holiday mode. 

We were advised to have lunch in the restaurant on site - our room was not ready. The food here was just okay. I strongly recommend walking and exploring the area and you will find some excellent choices. 

By 5pm our room was still not ready and after a long flight and unbearable jet lag, this was becoming a disappointment. We were given the use of a room but honestly this is not how I like to spend my holiday.

Trump towers is comfortable and fairly stylish. I would not say chic but modern in a generic way. The location is brilliant if you wish to shop and be near some of the best restaurants and generally walk with ease around Waikiki. It is a very short walk to the beach.

Rooms and bathrooms are spacious. Trump branded cosmetics made suitable for the huge bath tub are a nice touch. Beach bags complete with towels, water, fruit and sunscreen made our trip to Hanauma Bay very pleasant. 

This post is written a 14 months since our visit; I have had several holidays in the last 12 months or so. 

In hindsight, the apartment (aka condo or suite) was a huge overspend. Very likely you will end up with a kitchen, dining and living area that is simply not used. 

Furthermore the large scale furniture that was forced into the small areas was cramped and inconvenient and after a week was just plain irritating.

Would I stay here again? Probably not given the huge expense and some of the minor irritations. But, in fairness, you could not fault the staff. Trump is easy but for me it was missing the wow factor.","Date of stay: August 2015","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

So we moved here.  We booked a 1 bedroom with Den Ocean side....and we were told that the hotel was booked, and we got a free upgrade to a 2 bedroom corner suite ocean side.  OK...i guess i can live with that. :D
I chose Trump because most of the hotels i was looking at were mostly Old hotels that were refurbished....and Trump is one of the few hotels that was built from scratch and new.  I dont think you can find a similar space with the amenities and layout like the trump in Waikiki.  The only place i can suspect might compete will be the new ritz carlton that just opened this month.

PROS:
1) Amazing room- LARGE!  the space is very comfortable...from bathrooms, bedrooms, kitchen, living room and dining room...everything was enough space to move around.  The only missing thing is a bbq grill in the lanai. The hotel is also not that big...so you dont end up walking a mile of hallways just to go to the elevator, and ride 2 sets of elevators just to go down to ground level.  Its well designed. 
2) Quality - polished travertine floors, carpeting in living spaces, granite countertops, wood cabinets, full luxury appliances (viking), WINE fridge!  really well furnished.
3) TOTO toilets- these are the millenium falcon of toilets....highend control bar and sensors.  I wish every toilet is like this.
4) Free internet wifi that's actually fast.
5) comfortable beds and pillows- great mattress and comforters. very high quality you'd expect.
6) bathroom amenities - soap bar, full set of conditioner, shampoo, lotion, body gel, body sponge, sewing kit, ear buds, facial cleaning set, nail filer, shower cap, bathtube salt, toothbrush and toothpaste set ...the works!
7) professional lighting and tasteful interior design - it really feels well done....which most people dont realize...lighting helps your mood.
8) in-room washing machine and dryer....full size and highend.
9) TV in every room...decent channel selection....and paid programs for everything you want. ;P
10) SERVICE - excellent from everyone...very polite and helpful. Friendly and thoughtful.  You can borrow umbrellas, they have a beach bag with towels, water and fruits packed up and ready to go.  check in was fast and easy.  There is a complimentary business room, where you can use computers (macs) with big screens and print for free.  
11) They also have free bottled water available upon request and of any amount.
12) Location - although not exactly the best (not ocean side)...and not exactly at the center of the waikiki strip...its not that bad...and it has some very good selection of restaruants around and walkable.  its 1 block from the beach....not a bad walk at all...and its in front of the lame army museum.   They have a few chairs that you can charge to your room...about $40 for half day i think. But the beach itself gets pretty rocky a few steps in. ( not a great beach area)  Restaurant wise- its next to a great italian restaruant....Arancino, and tonkotsu place...Ginza Barin...a few food trucks, and Roy's.  Theres more on the strip but this location is pretty good in terms of shopping and food.
13) Concierge, Valet were very helpful and polite.

CONS:
1) Beach was rocky - althought i know this is not the fault of the hotel...we stayed where they had rented seats...and the beach in front of that was really rocky.  We did not try the area to the west...or further where there looks like a lagoon...but the area where they told us to go, sucked.
2) Food- we did not try the food in the hotel, but i am sure it is over priced. (nothing shocking about this though and not their fault)
3) Pool sucked....it might as well be a coy pond....its the most pathetic luxury pool ive seen.  Granted its a city hotel....so, real estate must be tight...but the pool area here was really small and crammed.  Sure theres a big beach outside....but still.

OVERALL- really nitpicking on the cons....but maybe the POOL was the only bad thing.  This place is great....cant really go wrong. Would go back if i can afford it again in the future.  I dont agree with most of his politics...But Trump did it right on this one.","Date of stay: July 2016","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Aside from the large bedrooms and flat screen TVs, the view was magical. I was even able to see the sun turn blue (at least in my eyes) at sunset. The room rate was a special and well worth the expense for luxury away from home. The concierge were extremely friendly and helped me order lei's to ship home.

We were greeted with bright smiles from everyone. 
After being presented with beautiful leis, we were escorted, via elevator, to the Hotel's Registration Desk on the 6th floor, where the kindness continued. We were offered cool towels and water to drink while we went through the registration process. Unfortunately, because we had arrived slightly early, our room was not quite ready. So we opted to sit, have a drink and a bite to eat, while taking in the gourgeous ocean view from our table on the lenai at Wai'olu. When our room was ready, someone came directly to our table in the restaurant to let us know. Our room was very nice. Clean, cool, well appointed, and best of all... That amazing ocean view!!! Our luggage was already there waiting for us, as was a bottle of sparkeling wine, chilled in an ice bucket. After unpacking, we went down to the Concierge Desk, where we met Mele. Since this was our first visit to Oahu, she helped us navigate around the island like pros. We were there for an entire week, and it seemed like each and every time we went by the concierge desk, there was Mele, always greeting us with a smile. The bell desk did an amazing job with our valet service as well. A quick call from our room to let them know we needed the car brought around, and no sooner did we step out of the elevator and into the lobby, and there was our car, waiting for us. Dean was always so kind to open and close the car door, and send us off with a big aloha and a smile. 
With all the political craziness surrounding our Presidential Election, we were given a hard time when we told people we were staying at the ""Trump"". Some of the comments were not very kind. But the reality is, this was our vacation! There's no room for politics when you're on vacation! 
Trump International Hotel Waikiki made our vacation a dream. 
We wouldn't hesitate to stay with them the next time we are in Waikiki!!!
 So to the entire staff that made our stay so wonderful, ALOHA and a big MAHALO!","Date of stay: June 2016","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The location and the interior of this hotel was fantastic. It was close to shopping and also the beautiful beach. All the staff that we've encountered at the hotel were both friendly and helpful. When we had checked-in, the young asian gentleman that had helped us, had offered to upgrade us to the one bedroom suite instead of the studio that we had booked. We loved the suite layout and also the ocean views.

The moment your car door opens, you will be pampered. Beautiful leis were placed around our necks and we certainly felt the Aloha-spirit.  The staff were very polite and extremely helpful.  We were given a quick tour on our way to the six floor lobby, where we were immediately greeted with a cooled lemongrass towel and water.  Very refreshing after a long flight and hot afternoon!  Our spacious room was on the 11th floor. This is not your typical room.  It includes a fairly elaborate kitchen, sitting area, desk, lanai, and large bathroom.  Numerous other amenities make your stay even more comfortable. A fitness area is located on the 7th floor which we used daily. It includes several pieces of cardio equipment (treadmills, elliptical, upright, recumbent and spin bikes -- with personal tvs.), a chest press and lat pull down selectorized resistance machines, dumbbells and several miscellaneous items (physio-balls, yoga mats, ab wheel).  The outdoor pool and hot tub are located on the 6th floor.  While a bit smaller than some other top-notched resorts, the design is very elegant, the staff is superb and the view is spectacular.  The little touches, such as refreshing fruit-inspired water and sunscreen keep you feeling pampered.  We most enjoy no pool towel ""limit"".  Sometimes one per person is just not enough, especially if you frequent the pool. The hotel has Trump kids and teen programs to help the kids have even more fun; something we did not use. With the hotel located on the south end of Saratoga Road, you are within walking distance of so many shops and restaurants. The hotel is a perfect stay for families or couples looking for that special occasion.  We will definitely return.

We're scheduled to spend one week here, and next week (starting Sunday) at the Fairmont in Maui. When booking our honeymoon, we decided to spurge and booked really nice hotels in both Oahu and Maui - it is our honeymoon after all! Overall, although we are really enjoying the Trump (it's beautiful), I think I was expecting more given the reviews and price. We booked a Superior ocean view room, instead of splurging for the 1 bedroom, which I think was a mistake. Here's a breakdown of what we've liked and haven't liked. 

Pro's 
- The staff have been lovely. We haven't encountered anyone who has been anything but 1000% friendly!
- The kitchenette in our room is a nice touch and has been really convenient for storing snacks!
- The location is great! It's only a 30 second walk to the beach and right next to TONNES of shopping! There is also easy access to the trolleys.
- The resort is absolutely beautiful!
- The resort has a a spa and restaurant. Although we haven't used them yet, it's great to have such east access should be choose too! 
- The rooms are fairly big given that it's a standard room. They also have two sinks, which is convenient.
- The view from our room is beautiful!!! I highly recommend requesting a high floor as them have the best views.
- Free wifi

Cons
- No walk-in shower. I had seen them in trip advisor reviews. I'm not sure if it's the type of room we booked or just bad luck that we didn't get one. 
- There are regular noises above us. It kind of sounds like someone is moving furniture around both during the day and at night. We called the front desk about this. Although it seems to have reduced, it's still happening (in fact I can hear in right now). The front desk said that it might be the wind blowing the furniture, so I'd avoid room 2021 in the future. 
- The pool is incredibly small. I know that past reviewers have said that it's small, but it's REALLY small. Given the price of this hotel (and that we're in Hawaii) I'd have expected a bigger pool.
- Although we did get a bottle of champagne, I think I assumed that our honeymoon would be celebrated more... maybe flowers in our room? Maybe my expectations are too high.
- Upon check in we asked for the cost of upgrading to a 1 bedroom suite. Given that it was midnight, we were told that they would let us know the next day (perfect!). However, we still haven't heard anything.","Date of stay: June 2016","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

But when we checked in, they offered the premium suite, which was larger by 15 sqm because of an additional den with its own sofa bed, a vanity nook, and an extra T&B - for only an additional $100 per night (usually $200-300 additional). It was actually good for eight - but since we were only five, we had lots of space and the kids enjoyed having their own bed each. 

The lobby is actually on the 6th floor. The ground floor is only for receiving guests, a lounge area for guest waiting for tour pick-ups, and for picking up towels and fruits on the way to the beach (and depositing same afterwards). Guests all get ku-kua nut necklaces when they arrive, then are ushered to the 6th floor where they check in. The 6th floor lobby is open air with a great view of the beach and ocean. It leads to the infinity pool and one of the outlets. From there, guests go up to their rooms. 

The suite is - huge! The living room has the best view of the ocean with a great balcony where my wife and I spent a couple of late nights drinking red wine from the nearby ABC store. The living room sofa set has a sofa bed which housekeeping will turn down if they know that it's been used the first night. When you leave the sliding door to the balcony ajar even the slightest, the ac turns off- which I've seen in only a few hotels. 

There are two bedrooms - one has a king and the other a queen. The king bedroom has a huge walk-in wardrobe area which has the safe. It also has the larger T&B, with a fully enclosed toilet area but a completely open shower area adjacent to the tub, which was a bit odd. I was very impressed wit the Trump brand toiletries - packaging was very well done. And non-fog mirrors which we appreciated. The cabinetry in the bedrooms were extremely well-executed, demonstrating exceptional craftsmanship. And both bedrooms had exceptional floor-to-ceiling views of the ocean as well. For some reason, it was the bigger bedroom that didn't have its own balcony - the smaller bedroom with the queen bed had one. 

The so-called den was actually a large alcove that seemed like a decent-sized bedroom - except that it only had three walls. My youngest son claimed it first and enjoyed the sort-of-private sort-of-exposed nature of the space. It had a sofa bed, side-night tables, coffee table, and TV on top of a credenza. The only downside was that it's T&B was a further walk down, near where the washer and dryer were. Talking about TVs, there were four LCD TVs in the suite and they could all be operated using the remotes from the other rooms, something I appreciated. 

But my wife was most impressed, actually, we all were, with the kitchen. There was a tabletop stove with four burners, a microwave, a ref, freezer, coffee maker, dishwasher, a sink on the kitchen island, plus all the equipment you would need to cook - pots, pans, covers, spatulas, etc. Cutlery and chinaware was similarly complete, as were the glassware. And the best part was - no matter how large a mess you made when cooking and eating, you just left everything in the kitchen island top and housekeeping would clean and tidy up so you were ready to cook again the next night and morning. The kitchen cabinetry was, like the bedroom woodwork, superb. The dining tabletop was heavily wax-coated so it could take a lot of abuse. 

The hotel is at the northwestern tip of Waikiki, with a short 100m walk to the sand. Bunched up beside it on the east side are other hotels, like the Outrigger Reef, which makes for a lovely late-afternoon-evening atmosphere on the streets between them. And with all the cooking-heating finery, it made sense to have several ABC grocery stores nearby. For example, my son on spur of the moment decided to do spaghetti so he got pasta, tuna, cheese, and sausages from the store and whipped up pasta for everyone. 

Although popular, I was surprised that for one of the Viator tours we contracted, Trump was not one of the pick-up stops so we had to walk to Outrigger Reef close by. 

It's the small touches that count when you're competing at the top tier and Trump International Waikiki delivers.","Date of stay: June 2016","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We were guests for 2 nights and had 2 rooms. The location of the hotel is perfect for access to the beach, restaurants and shopping. You enter on the ground floor and are personally greeted with shell necklaces. The attendant is aware of your arrival and escorts you to the second floor lobby for check in. We received an upgrade to a one bedroom city view which had a great view of Waikiki. We were on the 17th floor. The other room in our party had the same room on the 10th floor and the height definitely made a difference with the view You could still see the ocean from the 10th floor, but it is not as good.  Complimentary snacks were delivered to the room after we arrived--popcorn, 2 kinds of chocolate and cookies--all were delicious. 

The staff was very friendly. Room service was delivered quickly and it was fantastic. The buffet breakfast was very good as well.  They offer a good variety of choices, Japanese breakfast and omelet station.

Our flight was not until 7:30 p,m and they were able to extend a late check out in one of our rooms until the time of our departure which we appreciated very much and made it possible for us to fully enjoy our last day.

The rooms are well appointed and the beds are very comfortable with Frette linens. There are tons of amenities in the bathroom--they took up quite a bit of the counterspace, but we just moved them to the drawers. There was a full kitchen in the unit with high end appliances and dining table. We did not utilize them, but would be an asset if you are staying longer than 2 nights. 

For the money and the quality of our stay, I would say there is not a better value in Waikiki. I would definitely recommend it to anyone traveling to Honolulu.","Date of stay: June 2016","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We loved the pool area, but when it gets crowded, way too small. You cannot swim side by side up the pool, it is too narrow. No more than 6' wide. It has a pleasant outlook, but if you are going to have glass around the infinity pool, it needs to be cleaned regularly. The service around the pools was satisfactory. The food was not overly expensive, as you may expect. Give the location, the modern spacious apartments, we would recommend this place to families.

Faultless. The rooms are easily among the largest in Hawaii. We paid for a room upgrade to a suit so you have the seperate living area + balcony, marble bathroom and large kitchenette. The whole suite was so accommodating and convenient. We could get take away and use the kitchen facilties and eat in the dining area. The bathroom and bath were spacey and luxurious. The aircon is nice and not noisey and we got a 'partial view' room and the view was stunning!! 

We didnt get the full ocean view but what we had we couldnt fault. Part city/ hillside view and part ocean in full landscape really made us feel like we were waking up in Hawaii every day. 

The breakfast buffet is really good, quality and fresh and a great variety of cold and hot food. 

Hotel easily located across the road from the beach and a couple streets back from the main strip of shops we just couldn't fault the location either!!

The only problem we had was upon checkin they put us in a room that was overlooking the pool. Not their own pool, but a gross looking pool from a neighbouring hotel. It was SO LOUD we heard the kids screaming and playing in the pool from before we stepped out on the balcony. We requested another room but staff were quite unaccommodating saying that we could only pay for an upgrade, which is how we ended up in the partial view room. Plus side is was so quiet, no noise at all -but it did cost us an extra unexpected $500. I was quite surprised the hotel did not offer this upgrade for free to be honest. 

But overall amazing hotel, would definitely return and recommend to all.","Date of stay: April 2016","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

I find “location” to be one of the top options when choosing a hotel becomes the issue. Trump at Waikiki is an extraordinary option, three minutes walking distance from the beach, having the advantage to stay a bit “away” from the crowd. Lovely service, extremely clean, modern rooms, and those facing the beach, upper level, heaven. But if you want to pay a bit less, stay in whichever side. After all, you will stay “outdoors” in Honolulu… why bather about view … comfort comes first.

i'm not sure why this hotel has kitchen with stove, sink, etc, but i certainly did not go to hawaii, stay at a US$400+ room and cook any meals for myself, quite a waste of space

He used credit card points to stay here (plus some extra cash) and when we checked in Brent, at the desk, said our room (ocean front one-bedroom) was unavailable so they were upgrading us to a two bedroom ocean front suite. The place was huge with two ""living areas"" with sofas and magnificent ocean views, two bathrooms with Canadian-made Trump branded toiletries, two bedrooms, a big dining room, a granite-topped kitchen with Wolf appliances and gorgeous wood (black walnut?) paneling, and a lanai that comfortably sat two (but had a table and seating for four). 

The staff at this hotel was first rate. Everyone was friendly and helpful but not pushy or trying too hard. 

The location of the hotel is at the far end of Waikiki, across from the Army Museum (free to the public) and some beautiful beaches that are not as crowded as those further down the stretch of sand in front of the big chain hotel resorts. 

Our room had a thank you note from management in it with a tin of Honolulu cookies and the front desk staff sent up a slice of cake with Happy Birthday written in chocolate on the plate. 

I didn't want to support the Trump name or brand but I'm so happy my husband listened to TripAdvisor and booked here. I've stayed at many hotels in Honolulu but this one was definitely the best and deserves its 5-star rating.

I questioned staff about why it was rated number one on Trip Advisor and the reply was Service. During my stay I had a reasonable amount of contact with staff  and had no issues and in fact found them courteous and helpful. Check in was handled very well although I find a 3pm check in rather late and annoying. Putting that aside the staff were as good as most other good Hotels I have visited around the world but there was nothing exceptional.The toiletries were in my opinion average with the packages appearing on the cheap side. Our room was quite good with many extras like a wine fridge & fancy toilet control if that is what you fancy. Clean, fresh nice with all the extras you may wish for but like the rest of the Hotel uninspiring. I looked at several rooms and found that  to achieve a reasonable view over a building in front you needed to be around or over the 19 floor. Some Someone outside commented to me it was popular because it was the new boy on the block ( I dont know if that is true or not). If i was doing bussiness there I think I would be happy but as some one who has travelled over 70 countries around the world it lacked any bang for dollar factor for a holiday, especially once you left your room. It is my opinion that you would find better value with a hotel with more charisma. The infinity pool area in particular  appears sterile and is boring. I thank the staff for their good service and my comments are in no way derogatory toward them. There are many great Hotels around the world that people will remember  sadly this will not be one of those for me.","Date of stay: May 2016","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

We spent 10 days here and enjoyed everyone moment of it. Just across the road from the beach, great views and sensational service.

The rooms are spacious, with fabulous bathrooms and a kitchen with everything you could need. 

The property is right in the middle of everything an easy walk to the Ala Moana shopping centre and right in the middle of Waikiki. The fabulous Bills restaurant at the top of the street, Food Trucks a couple of hundred metres away and Starbucks at your doorstep.

The hotel provides a beach bag when you head to the beach, towels, water and fruit a shame that they have removed the sunscreen since our last visit.

My only suggestion would be they need to amp up the rooms again, soft furnishings need a bit of a update, its looking a bit bland and lifeless. The common areas also need a bit of a restyling to freshen everything up.

We were there for a 4-night family vacation and I had booked the hotel through American Express Platinum Travel Services to get the perk of 2 free breakfasts daily, in addition to the 4th night free deal offered by Trump Hotel itself. When we checked in, it turned out that I had booked with the wrong offer code through AmEx, meaning I don't get the free breakfasts. In order to get the package that I was expecting, that means I had to cancel my trip and rebook with AmEx. 

So there I was in the lobby, on the phone with AmEx while the Trump front desk (a superb gentleman named Doug) was going back and forth between AmEx and Trump booking desk, trying to work out the deal that I had wanted. I was there for 2 hours!!

Needless to say, I felt like the worst petty customer that all hotels hate.  Even though the process was long and tedious, Doug always had a smile and patiently spoke to AmEx and his booking desk.  In the end, he not only got the original deal for us, but he also upgraded our room for a discounted price so our family can stay together in a 2-bedroom instead of 2 separate rooms. Wow, the thoughtfulness. 

As if this wasn't enough, they asked for our kids ages and when we got to the room, all the kids had their own mini robes, mini slippers, and a stuffed turtle friend! Other than this, we also borrowed some board games for the kids to play, at no extra charge. There is also Wii console and games if you wanted as well. 

Overall, the experience was quite incredible and it has completely changed my expectation of a Trump Hotel. We will surely be back. Thank you, Doug!","Date of stay: February 2016","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

But we're thrilled we did and it's really worth the extra cost. The staff was amazing from the moment we drove in - they got us out of our car, led us to checkin and our bags were immediately brought to our room without us having to do a thing. 

The hotel provides beach bags stashed with towels (we completely forgot our's), a snack, and some water for when you're heading out. We never had to wait around for very long but everytime we waited, we were offered water (it's really important to me because I get dehydrated easily) and the staff was always polite and attentive. 

The rooms are comfortable and very well cleaned and they provide robes and slippers for lounging about. The beds are so nice and soft and I had some of my best sleep in a while when staying here. It's been possibly one of the best experiences I've had in a while staying at a hotel.

We usually stay at The Kahala but because our trip was short we wanted to be in Waikiki.  Every encounter at every turn and every level was met with friendliness, professionalism and ease.  We were fortunate to have Amber check us in, she was delightful and made our first impression all the more memorable.  We were given a beautiful suite and immediately applauded housekeeping for their efforts as the room was spotless.  There wasn't anything to find fault over.  The bathroom was wonderfully spacious, bath was welcome as were the amenities and bath gel bubbled up beautifully!  The Toto Toilet is the ultimate detail to luxury in the bathroom!  We are going to buy Toto Toilets for our house.  A comfortable bed, little kitchenette, desk and living area with big windows made the room a welcome retreat from the bustle of Waikiki.  The proximity to shops and restaurants is the reason we chose the hotel for our stay this visit knowing that the comfort of the hotel would be a pleasant respite.  We stay in top hotels when we travel and truly, without hesitation or question, this stay was flawless.  The bell desk was so friendly and supplied us with waters as we awaited our car service to the airport.  Clearly a hand picked team reflecting excellence at every level.  Again, can't say enough about how refreshing it was to find every detail checked.  It felt as though we were staying in someones home as guests and they had attended to every possible detail of our stay.  It was wonderful.

So its full priced but worth it for Waikiki central location. The apartments are well proportioned, well fitted-out and well maintained; the public areas, the same. The pool, while small is very clean and rarely crowded, which in our experience is a big plus with smaller children. Other large hotels in Oahu have older and less maintained pools, and frankly many where we have stayed in 5 star hotels get very murky and dirty by 4~5pm. So I would go so far as to say a lower likelihood of getting sick from the pool in Trump relative to most other bulge bracket 5 star hotels (eg. childrens' ear infections, tummy bugs etc.).

The staff and service at Trump are great. I don't know if this is a Hawaii thing or if the management looks after their staff well, but it seems to me staff turnover is very low. That is a good sign.

If you are spending US$700~1,000 per night incl. all taxes and parking for a high-end apart-hotel experience in Oahu, this is definitely the best option we have found. Since the Ritz Carllton is the same developer and basically the same concept as Trump, time will tell, but Im confident Trump will stay competitive.","Date of stay: April 2016","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

This was a gift from my family on my retirement and I enjoyed my stay here.
My family had a corner suite which overlooked the Park and looked out to the ocean, then on the Friday night we all got to see a grandstand vista of the fireworks over the road.
It had 2 bedrooms and a granite kitchen with everything you could wish for.  The suite had a washing machine and non functioning dryer.

My room overlooked the Parc pool and Modern Hotel, with a nice view of the ocean in the distance.

The bed was so comfortable and it came with 6 fluffy pillows, just the thing when returning from the long walk to the shopping precincts!
The most novel item in my room was the heated toilet (seat). It had a sensor that predicted when you were about to use the facility and lit up and self flushed!  Astounding.  I did not like the shower set up: the tap system was difficult to work and the shower head was just a handheld one, but the accessories were just beautiful, including the shampoo and conditioner.
Kauai coffee and plenty of bottled water were delivered daily and the room was very spacious, enough for me.

The wonderful doorman, Dean, made us feel very special when we returned from our days out.  He is a real treasure.
The infinity pool is lovely too, with an area for children to splash around, although the paving was a little slippery.

The location is a little away, but that bodes well for getting around without the crowds.","Date of stay: March 2016","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

While parents have a oceanfront view bedroom to themselves, I have some private space in the den with my own bed, and my brother took the bigger sofa bed in the living room with breathtaking view. They pull out the sofa bed every night for us, so we can have the usage of a regular living room during daytime. I was pretty happy with two bathrooms. The master room bathroom is open space area that can be opened in Oder to have a oceanfront view while taking bath. The kitchen was stocked completely with everything you need to cook. We had a dinner on the lanai while enjoying the Hilton Friday fireworks. It was the best spot for firework watching!!! The laundry washer and dryer were very handy, we used it at least every other day if not everyday. The Waikiki beach is every sandy and rocky, a quick wash for swim wears is a must. The front desk, concierge and housekeeping were friendly, even though I think they forgot to offer the cool drinks and the hand towels upon our arrival, but it was ok because the hospitality room before our red eye flight was really generous. It felt nice to be able to rest and to take showers before a late night flight, and it was very convenient. The beach bags were really handy to have with cold water bottle and towels plus an apple and orange for a day at the beach. The concierge suggested many local foodie spots and we enjoyed them all. The location is great as it is really close to main shopping street and food stands plus restaurants. We did not get to use the swim pool and fitness gym as we were too busy at the beach, but they looked decent and well prepared with lemon water and apples. If you need late night snacks, you can find them everywhere within minute walking distance (7/11, longs drugstore, and tons of abc stores). It's almost perfect except that the beach closest to the hotel is quite rocky and sandy. If you are looking for a beach to spend the whole day- go to hanauma bay instead!!! Oh, I forgot to mention that I joined the trump cards before arriving, it was great! The room is set up the way I like it - temperature, pillow type and higher floors. I mentioned that it was a trip to celebrate my mom's birthday, they actually gave her a plate of delicious cake. She was really surprised and happy. Plus, a box of Honolulu cookies was a nice touch to start the vacation. Thank you for many great memories.","Date of stay: March 2016","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We had a city view one bedroom suite, but still had a partial ocean view. We chose to stay here since we needed the space of a suite, and we weren't disappointed. 
The entire staff was extremely friendly, welcoming, and helpful, but never overbearing. When we called before our arrival to arrange a shuttle to Pearl Harbor and ask about transportation to Diamond Head, the concierge was so kind and helpful and never seemed rushed. 

The location is great for getting to everything, and the beach is across the street. The complimentary insulated beach bags with beach towels, bottled water, and fruit were appreciated and the concierge had them readily available. No resort fee, free wifi, and free bottled water daily. You do have to request turndown service if you are using the sofa bed. 
The heated infinity pool was my daughter's favorite part, not to mention the Trump Kids program, which included a welcome letter, stuffed animal, Hawaii-specific coloring book and crayons, and kid sized robe and slippers. They also left her a bag of Hurricane popcorn - a local snack with nori bits (yum!) - and Honolulu Cookie Co. cookies.

Since it is the Trump, the bathroom is covered in marble, there was a Toto toilet, the appliances were Subzero and Bosch, and EVERY. Single. Thing has ""Trump"" on it. The locally produced coffee and bottled water and the extensive toiletry selection in the bathroom (they provided enough of everything for all four of us) all bear the Trump logo.

I arrived a little earlier than the normal 4pm check-in time, but Doug from the front desk was able to accomodate my family with an early check-in.  Upon arriving to my room, there was a birthday dessert placed on the kitchen table along with a personal message from the General Manager of the hotel. The surprise gesture was very heart warming. Jason from the bell staff was very friendly and informative upon delivering all my luggage. It was a Friday evening and at 7:45pm, I had an amazing view of a firework show from the 18th floor. My room overlooked the beach and Fort DeRussy park which was very therapeutic. The next morning, my daughter and I enjoyed the breakfast buffet on the 6th floor. The wait staff were very sweet. We then got pampered at the Trump Spa. I choose a 60 minute massage and a 60 minute facial. Ryoko did an amazing job! I felt so relaxed after. The housekeeping staff at this hotel is top notch. Every time I used a towel or an amenity, it was replenished immediately. I felt as if it was impossible to keep my room messy. They are like ninjas and were always servicing our room whether it be turn down service or just simply restocking our pantry. Every time I returned to my room, it was nice and neat again although I was just gone for a short amount of time. They just come out of the wood work and you can't help but just smile when you experience their enthusiasm. The hotel was just a hop and a skip away from numerous restaurants and stores. We enjoyed a meal at Tommy Bahama's, Roy's and Yardhouse just to name a few. The valet team here is very quick and personable! On my last day, I inquired about a later check out since reality was setting in as my vacation was coming to an end. I did not want to leave. The front desk agent Judy was able to extend my stay for an extra 4 hours. She mentioned the next guest wasn't checking into this room until much later in the day so I could enjoy my room a little longer. I had done some shopping and ended up with double the amount of luggage than when I arrived. I asked the bell staff if they could help me ""move house"" to the front entrance. If I can remember correctly, I believe their names were Keanu and Kawika. I will always remember these gentlemen as they made me feel so welcomed!

We ended up with an ocean view room and it included a lanai which is a must with the view.

And being a newer hotel we figured there would be less deferred maintenance issues and it was a solid choice.

The Trump did not miss.  We were treated to an upgrade which only enhanced the experience.  They are 5 star and it really shows in the service and how you are treated.  Twice a day room service and top notch restaurant experiences ( at all three restaurants) were nice treats.  Washer and dryer in our unit made laundry a cinch.

All staff was incredibly pleasant and accommodating.  Valet car service was always zippy, 3-5 min.

The reviews are correct that the pool is small but many of the hotels have smaller pools because oh that's right there is Waikiki beach 300 feet away!  They give you beach bags and towels every day and there are beach chairs and umbrellas that can be set up for you at the beach.

The hotel is not right on the beach but the walk us about 3 min and the 6th floor pool and lounge view is stellar !

The place is pricey but you get what you pay for and if you want some luxury this is the place to enjoy some!

Recommend getting set up with Trump loyalty program so you can let them know how you like your stay to roll.

You may not like the Don's hair, but his hotels are second to none!","Date of stay: March 2016","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Loved it ! Very comfortable the service is like no other ... Always enjoyed coming home each night to relax in room . Our teenage daughters loved the room layout with kitchen , pool and felt very comfortable on their own around property. Great views for the fireworks , ocean and city.
Beach bag is always very nice to have with towels and water ...will definitely recommend this property to others . Nice to see familiar faces from our last visit 5 yrs ago especially Dean in valet.. Always a pleasure to chat with . 
Pool service was always top notch .

Twin beds were a bit on the small size and parking was a bit high but no other complaints . Hope to return again . Mahalo","Date of stay: March 2016","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Here's a list of the pro's and VERY few cons that we noticed:

Pros: 
Room was clean and comfortable
Every little thing was offered - toothbrush, toothpaste, sewing kit, shoe mitt, shoe horn, q-tips, notepad, letterhead and envelopes, bottled water numerous times throughout the day, turn down service, etc...
Location, location, location!

Valet parking
Great food

Great view from the 6th floor pool of sunset

Cons:
Pool was wonderful but tiny - we never noticed a huge crowd though
Overnight parking - $35 (eesh!)
Breakfast buffet - AWESOME but $40 per person (eesh!)
Shower - great, deep soaking tub but no curtain or sliding glass door (felt like I was going to spray the entire bathroom with the handheld shower head every time I took a shower)","Date of stay: March 2016","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The front desk staff was very accommodating, upon arrival (close to noon) we were greeted with a lei greeting, a cool drink, early check in and a free upgrade. When we got to our room, there was a bottle of sparkling wine waiting for us in the fridge.

There was a notable difference in service and general upkeep of the hotel this trip.  It seems clear that now that the developer is working on and selling out the Ritz Carlton project that they have basically given up on the Trump property.  

The hotel and amenities are nice but not what they once were.  Waikiki really has no 5 star property for those that expect that level of service.  

The free wifi is basically unusable and measured .78mbs when I complained I was told that I couldn't expect more than 1.0 anyway.  Well when my cell phone was getting 10mbs on LTE that made the wifi worthless.  

We tried to order drinks at the lobby bar and sit on the balcony and watch the fireworks but was told the seats were all reserved.  So while we stood at the end the 14 seats went unused !  One other guest asked again after the fireworks why she'd not been allowed to sit down and watch and the staff pretended to be unclear and said ""Oh, did you want to sit down?""  

I will give credit where credit is due however.  The valets were wonderful , friendly and helpful at every encounter.  The shining star on the staff is the pool attendant Kai who was amazing!  He was helpful, friendly, attentive without being intrusive.  He belongs at a world class resort.  He made every afternoon at the pool a pleasure.  

So for a nice room with a kitchen and good location and solid 4 star rating this is a good option.  The nightly turn down service is nice and the room is kept very clean so kudos to the housekeeping staff.  

Overall, the Trump Waikiki is not what it once was but its still better than virtually any other hotel experience in the area.  

Shame on other hotel groups like Starwood for rating their properties higher based on location with no concern for the hotel condition or actual service provided.","Date of stay: February 2016","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Well, this hotel was even better than we anticipated it would be! The staff is extraordinary! Every employee we spoke to was very friendly, very happy and genuinely concerned about our stay and did their best to accommodate all of our requests. I was hesitant since it's not located right on the beach, but I also wanted to be within walking distance to restaurants so we weren't stuck at the resort eating the same foods every day. This didn't end up being a problem whatsoever though, the beach is literally right across the street and the concierge supplies you with an insulated beach bag, towels and sand toys for your kiddos if needed (you also get bottled water and fruit).  The pools may seem small, but it gets the job done! We always were able to have chairs and there was plenty of room for our baby to splash around and have a great time without disturbing other guests. The pool staff, like all other employees, are wonderful people who want you to enjoy your stay. If you are traveling with a baby, swim diapers are also provided at the pool area, so you never have to worry about remembering to bring extras to the pool with you.  Since we were traveling with our baby, we reserved a crib for the room. The cribs are very nice, much better than the cheap metal cribs most hotels provide. Our bathroom was even stocked with a diaper genie that was changed twice a day! The location is also great and conveniently located next to shopping and tons of restaurant options all within walking distance. If we decide to return to O'ahu, we will definitely be return guests. I am so happy that we decided to book the Trump and I don't have one complaint about our entire stay!","Date of stay: March 2016","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The room was very clean and very well maintained. It had everything we needed. Whenever we need to go out to the beach, we were given (upon request) a beach bag with towels, water and snacks.

WAI'OLU Ocean View Lounge offers a lot of choices. Wait staff and bartender were all great.

I also arranged a private chef as part of our stay and it did not disappoint. The dinner we had was prepared fresh right inside our room.

We stayed in a deluxe suite with a city view and a partial ocean view. We were not happy with the first room on the 8th floor we were given because although it was bigger, it had no balcony and the noise from the technical floor right below made it hard to sleep. We were glad when the hotel manager offered us a free upgrade to a room in the 23rd floor with a balcony and wonderful views. The hotel room is very well equipped, it has a lovely kitchenette with all amenities so we opted out of hotel breakfast buffet which is pricy but had our breakfast in the room instead. The hotel gives complimentary water bottles every day which us very convenient. The bathrooms are super with a very deep bath tub, a separate walk-in shower, double basin and a heated and remote- controlled self-cleaning WC with full pampering service ( bottom shower and dryer). The concierge service is exceptional, they made our stay and entertainment very easy and comfortable. Although the hotel stays in the second row from the ocean it is a plus because the beach is only 200 m away but you do not see crowds in front of your window. The hotel offers a free beach cool bag with a towel, water and a fruit pack for staying guests. We also found that you as a Trump guest you can have the sun lounger at the beach fee ($ 25 for 2 hours) be charged directly to your room. The shopping area in Waikiki is 300 m away, the hop-on Waikiki trolley stops right outside the hotel ( we had to buy a 7 day ticket for $65 per person although some hotels offer complimentary shuttle tickets for their guests).

We were greeted by Case with leis, spa water, and cool towels. We checked in with Matthew who upgraded us to a partial ocean view room and was so accommodating to our needs with a toddler. Hi Matthew!

Our room on the 22nd floor was beautiful and spacious and smelled so nice right when we walked in. We had a fully stocked kitchenette, king bed, pull out couch, and a crib with baby toiletries, baby wipes and a baby blanket. The bathroom was also fully stocked and the bidet was life changing (lol!). Our lanai faced the Embassy Suites lanais and the ocean was directly to our right. Such a beautiful view!

Housekeeping did a spectacular job taking care of our room and they also offered turn down service. One night our daughter got sick and we needed a change of sheets.

After debating back and forth about our little vacation, we were finally convinced that this hotel would be the perfect fit for our specific needs.  I had made the hotel aware of my recent diagnosis with breast cancer, and that i had many limitations on what I could be exposed to while going through treatments.  Upon check-in, I was informed that they had made us a hypoallergenic room...one of the Executive Staff members had instructed the housekeeping staff to clean the room with non-toxic products, and had made sure that everything was sterilized. Because of my low immune system due to chemotherapy, I was so thankful for this! I also made the hotel aware of my daughter's dairy/peanut allergies prior to check-in, so instead of a Welcome platter of cookies and chocolates, they had made a platter of fresh fruits for her beautifully set on the kitchen counter of the room! Being aware of our wedding anniversary as well, we were also given a bouquet or flowers!  We loved the attention to detail when it came to our children. There were coloring books and crayons set on the dining table for them, along with a cute stuffed animal!  But the absolute best was the ""Trump Kids"" bath robes and comfy slippers! We were surprised how fully equipped the kitchen was...this really made it feel like ""home"".  The hotel staff was impeccable, they really made us feel like family to them! We absolutely loved that there were organic food options at Waiolu Lounge...hopefully they'll be able to bring on more of an array of organic items in the future.

For me the only down side to this is the breakfast caters more towards the japanese market and not of an international traveller.

Location is prime though not directly on the beach...but walking distance to most of Waikiki main streets and the beach itself. The service was excellent throughout our 7 night stay. I loved that there was an endless supply of fresh towels in our bathroom throughout the day. The room was spotless and our maid was, we joked, perhaps a little OCD and particular about the details...which we enjoyed nonetheless. We also enjoyed the daily beach bag which included towels, water and an apple and orange and the 4 hours of free valet parking which was great for our visiting friends who came into Waikiki to have dinner with us. 

I would have rated Trump a 5 star if the beds were a little more comfortable. We found the beds too soft (body would sink into it) and didn't have enough support. At first we thought the pillows were too soft too but later found out that they have a pillow service where you can choose your own pillow. Thank goodness for that service. With the upgraded pillow we slept a bit better. However there were still some twisting and turning because of the softness of the beds.

Anyway, I would still recommend staying here. Looking at many of the older hotels in the area...I would say that I would definitely prefer modern and classy boutique (what the Trump is) over touristy mega villages.","Date of stay: February 2016","Trip type: Traveled with friends","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Flight was early so we arrived to do the checkin, paid extra money to get an ocean view  room which was REALLY worth trying!
Room is spacious and equipped with kitchen stuff, feel like home. We could see the breath-taking view of the ocean direct from the balcony, undescribable! There are lots of Japanese guests stay here so part of the hotel staff are bilingual, also attentive. Special mention to the staff on the ground floor,they are helpful and willing to solve any of your problem.
Impeccable facility. I've read some reviews about the small swimming pool, well it's a bit crowded during peak hours. It doesn't influence the hotel quality of TOP class, GYM is 24/7 with a room key, towels, iced-water and fruit are prepared aside for guests. Concierge has a free beach bag to borrow, it has 2 bottles of water, towels, some snacks inside, very thoughtful.

He offered to have our things taken up to our room. I believe Troy (valet) took care of the car as I informed him we would be back shortly. He made sure the car was here in the front. Excellent service! And that's not it, Case gave us a warm welcome with leis for myself, my son, and all his friends who were there to stay over. The front desk check in was simple and smooth. We walked into our 3 bedroom suite, which had panoramic views from diamond head to the west side of the island. Spectacular ocean front view, welcome amenities for myself and the kids as well as a personal card addressed to my son from the GM. Emilio and Kawika (bellman) had already set all of our luggage in the room, as well as put all the drinks and food in the fridge. Housekeeping does a wonderful job making sure the room is perfect. Ben from room service came up and delivered a bottle of sparkling apple cider for the kids to enjoy. All I can say is that this is by far and away the best hotel I have ever stayed at. Yes, it was in part of the beautiful hotel itself, but more so the staff that makes you feel like you're coming home. I will be back!

The hotel is nicely located just off the main strip and very close to all the good restaurants in Waikiki. The hotel would be a fantastic property for a business trip however does not have the beach holiday feel to it that other properties like the Outrigger or Moana Surfrider have. We had an ocean view room that was a wonderful spacious room with kitchenette however the view was over fort du russey and not the glamourous Waikiki beach and diamond head side. The hotel is more of a glorified serviced apartment and not a glamourous 5 star hotel - the entrance is simple and minimal and the no frills lobby is located on the 6th floor (which is inconvenient when you are in a rush to check out). The buffet breakfast is average and nothing special with non existent views (looking straight into the neighbouring embassy suites property).

Ever.","I had such a wonderful stay here in September that I decided to return in January, with my sister, niece and nephew, during our school holidays.  The stay was everything I'd hoped it would be and there are now three more fans of this incomparable hotel.  

Everything went so smoothly, from initially enquiring about the accommodation options, through the actual booking process and especially when we arrived, tired from our overnight flight from Australia.  From the moment you drive up, you are greeted by the kind and friendly staff, who seem genuinely pleased to meet you or welcome you back.  I believe that the tone of a stay is set from the moment you arrive and that was true for this stay.  We arrived early but that wasn't a problem when we checked in.  I had been dealing with Hiroshi Kanzaki and he was on hand to greet us and it felt like meeting an old friend.  He was so friendly and helpful and to my utter delight, he upgraded us to a three bedroom apartment with an incredible view.  We couldn't believe how lucky we were to be staying there.  The view made us feel like we were on a ship as there were ocean views wherever you looked.  

The apartment was very spacious, with balconies off two bedrooms and the lounge area as well, and we enjoyed sunset ""cocktails"" on this lanai every afternoon.  And we had a front row seat for the Hilton Friday night fireworks! The full kitchen was a welcome amenity on those mornings we wanted to stay in for breakfast, and it has everything.  Dishwasher, four burner stove, oven, huge fridge, tea towels, dishwasher, wine glasses, crockery etc. etc. and even a rice cooker!  The apartment didn't have any visible signs of wear and tear, so it is very well looked after.  The housekeeping staff do an amazing job of keeping it looking immaculate.

The amenities here are just a level above every other place I've stayed in Hawaii, and having that space to relax really made the trip for us.  As did the staff - I cannot speak more highly of the people who work here.  Every single person is there just for you, or so it seems.  It's the little things that make a hotel great, things like being greeted with a friendly ""Welcome back"" by Dean the doorman every time you came back to the hotel, which made us feel like old friends.  Because of that, we are now planning our next visit to this fabulous oasis and we can't wait to return.","Date of stay: January 2016","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

They held the doors open for my husband, myself and both my 4 and 5 year old, and made my kids feel very comfortable. The ladies greeted us with leis and friendly smiles while we had someone take care of all our luggage and brought us up the elevator. 

When we arrived in the room, we were surprised to see some treats and welcomed with a few things to help us start our stay. The room was tidy, perfect temperature, and very well maintained. We had to call front desk service for assistance (wi-fi, extra blankets, and dining recommendations) and they were very prompt and responsive.

Our two days at the Trump Waikiki was such an amazing experience, they truly treat their guests with VIP service and with such professionalism. Every employee we've interacted with treated us with warm aloha and a friendly smile-it really shows how strong customer service is and how genuine the employees are.

I must say, the employees on the ground level made a huge impact with my family visiting and attending our dinner.. The housekeeping staff continuously kept our room(s) looking immaculate and they were just the friendliest people.

We were first given a warm and welcoming greetings from the staff at the entrance with leis, and were also given a refreshing fruit infused water and cold towels once we arrived to the Front Desk. Everyone at the Front Desk looked up and smiled at us, which made us feel really special because it's hard to get that warm feeling elsewhere. The room was very beautiful and spacious, and the view of the ocean from our room was spectacular! Every time we walk out of the hotel, the we were also greeted with a warm ""Aloha"", and overall the hotel staff provided exceptional service.

As a luxury travel advisor I am privileged to stay at 5 star properties around the world, and I can honestly say that nowhere else on earth have I felt a more genuine warmth.

In the upper echelons of hospitality, ratings move from square footage and bath products to the finest details, beyond thread count and smart lighting, to that elusive quality that transforms a personal touch into a feeling that stays with you days, months, even years later.

Luxury properties actively seek to inspire this feeling in many ways, from a front desk agent knowing your name whom you know you've never met, to housekeeping setting the temperature to where you last left it... Not just yesterday, but 2 years ago. 

This is luxury, but no matter how many details are remembered or anticipated, it takes real human compassion, real care to create that special feeling and no one does it quite like Trump Waikiki- their staff truly embodies the Aloha spirit.

As for the property itself, it is stunning, with maximum use of indoor/outdoor space which is key for me in any tropical locale where the point is to luxuriate in balmy delight. I stayed in the deluxe ocean view king room where I could literally see the sea from the bed. 

A large balcony allowed for premium views with a lovely sitting area inside, essentially a junior suite configuration. The bathroom was the show stopper comprised entirely of blue-veined white marble, a deep soaking tub large enough for 2 (possibly more!) and a ""bath bar"" featuring deluxe products such as salts, scrubs, loofahs, the works.

I was most surprised at the kitchen, however. It was beautifully made in dark wood and stainless steel with a stove top, microwave, pots, pans, mini-fridge, ice maker, I could honestly live there!

The hotel is in an incredibly convenient location within walking distance to most of Waikiki. Everything about this property is excellent, I can't wait to return!","Date of stay: November 2015","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We were across the street from the beach and just a short block off the main drag.  This was a quiet location which is appreciated as it can get loud in Waikiki.  The valet parking was a separate charge but the car was brought out front very quickly and the valets were helpful in moving our roof up and down, adjusting the seats for us.  The hotel provides complimentary beach bags each time you go to the beach and each has a bottle of water, two pieces of fruit and a beach towel.  Much appreciated!

We arrived after the red eye from Tokyo and were tired--it was 8:30 am and we were able to check in and get some much-needed rest!  Most Honolulu hotels are relatively strict on check-in time from my experience, so this was unexpected and welcome.

The room was great--bed was comfortable, room was well-equipped if you wanted to whip up a snack (I didn't), bathroom had luxury finishes, and the balcony was large with a very tiny ocean view from the 11th floor.  Nice touches like cookies and nightly turndown.  Everything felt new and fresh, which is unusual in many Waikiki hotels...

Staff was friendly and helpful.  They supply a beach bag for beach time with towels, water, fruit, and a bag.  Didn't eat at the restaurants, so can't comment there.  Pool is pretty small for the size of the hotel, but I'd rather spend time on the beach while in Waikiki.

Although pricey, if you can catch a deal (I ended up getting a good one online at the last minute) it's definitely in the top 3 for hotels on Waikiki.","Date of stay: January 2016","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We stayed in a 2 bedroom/3 bathroom/full kitchen/two balcony plus den suite during late December and will definitely be returning every time we stay in Oahu.  Our family party of 7 arrived early in the morning and very conscious that our 4 year old Duke and 6 month old Daisy would need a day sleep following the overnight flight from Sydney.  We had spoken with the hotel in the week leading up to our stay and had requested an early check in (normally 3pm) or at least use of their arrival suite.  We had also received an email from the hotel prior to our arrival enquiring about the ages of Duke and Daisy.  We were so impressed by what we discovered – reception apologised that we would have to wait 15 minutes (we expected hours) for the room to be made available.  When we were shown to our MAGNIFICENT suite at 10.30am (at no extra charge) was wonderful.  The kids had personalised amenities – Duke had his own perfectly fitting Trump bathrobe and slippers.  Daisy had her own very high quality crib (rather than a fold out porta-cot) that we were able to wheel into the oversized walk-in robe and use for her bedroom during our stay.  The bedrooms huge.  The beds high-end quality.  The bathrooms better than most hotels around the world (two bathrooms ensuite with tubs).  The living area huge (two pull out beds).  The kitchen would be an upgrade in most homes around the world.  EVERYTHING surpassed expectations.  Around the hotel, the detail and facilities were high quality.  The infinity pool, the restaurants (great breakfast), room service as well as the location were all great. 
 
Whilst the service was impeccable from everyone at the hotel, we wanted to single out Dean on the concierge desk.  He was fantastic every day, from organising cars, planning our trip to the north of Oahu, providing hints on restaurants along the way, giving valuable advice on our day trip to Hanauma Bay or organising our luggage to be walked across to our next hotel – all with a smile and enthusiasm.  Thanks Dean.
 
Duke’s view: the shallow part of the pool was my favourite and I liked the lady coming up to give me a towel every time I was finished; I liked sleeping in the den and I had 4 TVs to watch, even though I didn’t because the beach was so close that we spent lots of our time there; Mummy was very happy because her favourite breakfast place (Bill’s) was just around the corner and her favourite shops only two blocks away.","Date of stay: December 2015","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I had a chance to dine at the in-house steak house ""BLT"" in which I was not impressed. Bad service and average food but pricey.

The accommodations and service are first class.  Condo type accommodations are spacious and reasonably priced for suite type accommodations.  The beach is a very short walk across the street - a few hundred yards. The concierge will call ahead and beach chairs and an umbrella will be waiting for you on the beach ($50. a day rental for two lounge chairs and an umbrella or $30. For a half day.).  They will also supply a beach bag with towels, water and fruit at no charge. If you prefer the pool to the beach the hotels infinity pool is very nice but it is small and not a resort type pool.  The level of service at the pool is excellent - plenty of deck chairs,  food and drink is available etc... The hotel does not offer resort type activities but will direct you to places that offer them.  
The hotels breakfast buffet is very good as was BLT steak.  
In summary, an excellent hotel with a very high level of service.","Date of stay: January 2016","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

But the hotel is entirely underserving of trip advisor's number 1 ranking in Honolulu.  This is genuinely bewildering as to why guests would rave so much.  While perfectly clean and furnished to good standards, it is not beach front and does not have resort facilities, rooms come with a view of other high rises in front of the beach, the pool is so small that 3 people equate to overcrowding. Nothing about the hotel induces relaxation... The staff were well trained and helpful, but again, there is nothing that makes this property stand out over others in the area. Given the sycophantic reviews my partner and I were rather disappointed that this property did not leave up to the experience promised.

The lanai was nice, but very windy. , Unfortunately, the building itself is cold and has a corporate feel and is really, really not a resort. The beach is a solid block from the hotel, although they make up for this with the very convenient beach bag service. There is a concession stand on the beach that allow you to bill chair and other beach rentals to your room. The pool was especially weak - small and befitting a business hotel, not a vacation hotel. Structurally, this is really a business hotel that should be in NY or LA or Chicago or downtown Honolulu, not on Waikiki Beach. On the other hand, the service was extraordinary - warm, personal, accommodating in every way. The bellman and doormen are so nice. The maids are wonderful, attentive yet mindful of guest privacy. The staff really seems to value the guests and especially children. Honolulu is very nice, but is no Maui.

Looked at many deals being offered on the Internet. The most attractive deal was a 1-night stay at the Trump International Hotel. An ocean view studio room with a fully stocked kitchenette, king size bed, and sofa sleeper sufficient for 4. Free wi-fi. The bathroom had a walk-in shower with a separate deep soaking tub. A set of plush bath robes and bedroom slippers with the Trump insignia were put to good use. We understand why this hotel has a 5-star rating. From the moment we checked into the hotel, we were given the royal treatment having someone escort us to the front desk and then offering us ice cold  water served in a glass with cold hand towels. After checking us in, another staff member gave us a brief tour of the hotel facilities and then escorted is to the elevator. Told us that if we wanted to go to the beach, they will provide us with a tote bag filled with fresh fruit, water and beach towel. While the family used the infinity pool and jacuzzi, I used the 24 hour gym with free weights, universal weights , stationary bikes, elliptical, and treadmill set. Free bottled water. The hotel is centrally located with many restaurants around the corner and the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center 2 streets away. The hotel staff told us to make sure we watched the evening firework display from our room. The fireworks are set off every Friday at the nearby Hilton Hawaiian Village. We had a birds eye view of the spectacular fireworks. We left our balcony door open for most of the evening. We were surprised at how quiet the noise level was from our floor. No hotels on opposite side of street. Check-out time is 12 noon. The hotel staff mentioned that if we wanted to stay on property and use their facilities after check-out , wasn't a problem. Our plan is to hang around a bit longer to make use of the pool. Couldn't have asked for a better place to stay than Trump International. It has lived up to its 5-star rating. Would highly recommend.","Date of stay: December 2015","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The rooms and hotel are exceptionally modern and clean, the restaurants are top calibre. While we did not use or view the amenities, there was a very pleasant pool near the bar (not all the top hotels have a pool) and was very close to the beach.

The leading hotel chain offerings have made a number of sacrifices to quality given their location on Waikiki beach.

Our room was a 1 bedroom + den oceanview suite which had a full size kitchen and washer/dryer.  *Remember only suites come with fullsize kitchens and washer/dryers. We arrived late so the housekeeping team performed turndown service prior to checking in.  The suite was so spacious and could sleep 4 easily and with privacy--there is a sofa bed in the den.  

We enjoyed dinner at Waiolu--the Firecracker Roll, kalbi, loco moco, and pork shumai were all delicious.  The Pualani and the Maui Mule cocktails were refreshing, tasty, and freshly made!  The live entertainment didn't hurt either!  

We went to InYo for breakfast and the selection was great!  The buffet is a must as ala carte items on the menu are also included.  

Thank you Trump Waikiki for an amazing stay!","Date of stay: December 2015","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

But the main flaw is housekeeping, for two days straight they came into the room without knocking, and on the third day we had do not disturb sign on until 2:30, then we were gone until around 8pm, when we came back our room was still as is.  They came to do a quick clean up, but the garbage was not cleaned, and the bed set (which they were supposed to change on the third day) was not changed.

It was more like a luxury apartment than a hotel room. Absolutely amazing. Excellent service from a very warm and friendly staff. Even housekeeping staff in elevators were engaging.

We enjoy heading to Honolulu for the Pearl Harbor Day festivities.  This time we stayed in a great suite on the 23rd floor with wonderful views.  The layout of the suite was excellent, and having a full kitchen was a real treat.  As usual, the staff were absolutely outstanding -- courteous, friendly, and helpful.  The food was excellent.  Only one problem that is difficult to understand: the mattresses are as hard as a rock.  As a result, I had a very broken sleep each night.  I cannot understand why a luxury property like this would have mattresses like that.  I stay in fine hotels all over the world, and the beds in most fine hotels are far better.

The first two days (prior to the cruise) we stayed at the Marriott, and my review of that hotel is already on this site.

The final three days, after a week at Turtle Bay, we spent at Trump International. Frankly, the difference between the Marriott and Trump International, is light years apart even taking account of the price differential. 

From the moment we were greeted at the first floor lobby to the moment the chauffeur picked us up to drive us to the airport, our experience at Trump International was truly outstanding. The suite was elegantly decorated, contained a small kitchen should one choose to fend for themselves, and was immaculate in presentation.

Importantly, the staff were quite outstanding which was diametrically opposed to our first two nights in Honolulu.

Trump International is above the mid price-point range, but whether you regular choice is five star hotels, or you just want to spoil yourself, then you'll not go far wrong at Trump International.","Date of stay: January 2015","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

-	The lobby on the 1st floor smells like garbage, especially in the morning
-	Some room amenities that they used to offer were no longer in the room such as Honolulu cookies as welcome gift, bath salt and loofah
-	We didn’t receive our turn down service on the 1st night and housekeeping didn’t replace the empty shampoo/showerl gel bottles with new ones (I hate it when hotels are being stingy with bath products)
-	We booked the deluxe ocean view studio thinking all ocean view studio should face Fort DeRussy (At least that’s what the layout on their website looks like.)  However, when we checked into our room, we were given a room on the opposite side with ocean view partially blocked by Halekulani.  We called the front desk and was told the room we received is categorized as deluxe ocean view as well.  I explained we were here back in June of this year and stayed in a partial ocean studio and had the exact same view.  The lady told us she will look for other availability and call us back ASAP.  After 10 minutes wait, she moved us to a room facing Fort DeRussy on the 12th floor. 

The good things are…
-	They gave us a complimentary bottle of sparkling wine for our anniversary
-	They honored our late check-out request and gave us a 9pm late check out…I don’t think you can find this kind of service anywhere else
-	The staff are super friendly and helpful, especially people working at bell desk and concierge.

I will definitely come back to stay here again for all the good things that I’ve mentioned but my experience here used to be so perfect with nothing to fault at all and this has changed.","Date of stay: November 2015","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

We stayed in a Deluxe Room with Ocean View and it was perfect! Beautiful breath taking views with plenty of space for more than 2. Maid service and turn down service were very attentive and did not disturbed.

We last stayed here as a couple last year and have now come back with our baby. During this trip we have also stayed at another 'luxury' hotel in Waikiki and we are so glad to have changed to Trump! 

Amazing service here is the key to their success in providing a seamless experience to their guests. Nothing is too much here when it comes to your wants and needs. From valet to housekeeping to reception everyone is friendly, happy, approachable and willing to help. 

Food is great with a well-presented breakfast buffet with a wide array of options. In-room dining is exceptional and delivered in good time.

Another positive thing is that it doesn't feel as though there are too many people staying here yet it isn't isolated either. For example there were guests at the pool this morning but no more than 10 which was good for us with the baby.

While we were upgraded for this stay, even the regular studio guest room is luxurious (in which we stayed last year) with a giant marble bathroom and modern furnishing. Our suite this time has a separate bedroom and a full kitchen, laundry and second bathroom. They have thought of everything!

If you are looking for a luxurious stay in the heart of Waikiki just one block back from the beach, Trump is it! It may not be right on the beachfront but the complimentary cute black beach bag filled with towels, cold water and fruit makes the short walk worth it!

Not much of a ""wow"" factor entering lobby.
Deluxe studio room was nice but again missing the ""wow.""
Unpleasant letter left on desk warning of a possible wake up to a 8-11am bug spray down following morning for our floor/rooms, (who wants to worry about being waking up to a knock or visit on vacation?!) -glad to know they are on top of it, but it gave me a ""buzz kill"" in paradise even thinking about bugs in my room.
Pool was a bit small more of a wading pool, but nice views, the service was a bit slow for drinks etc..

Pros-
Most comfortable bed award.
Room service breakfast was prompt and good (although organic eggs would have been a nice touch over the cheap yellow yolk).
Everyone was friendly.
""Best mai tai"" really was that at the pool area. Mmmmm sorbet float!

However, the buses and tracks were so noisy when we opened a window.

It met my needs brilliantly when flying back from USA to drop 2 boys with their father for a holiday and then continue on to OZ. I wanted a place that I felt safe while alone and not surrounded by families with kids.

 I wanted to be close to the beach and with a lovely pool to sit by and offers great service and food . Although the pool doesn't have a beach view it does offer you a view of the park to the right but the direct view is the back of other hotels. The side view from the pool and seating area is better with park and city views because you have a feeling of space and openness. That would be where you would have a drink and enjoy the sunset. For me the pool worked as I just wanted to chill, read and listen to music and it was very relaxing with very few kids.

I loved my room as was given a partial ocean view that I was very grateful to receive. The room was beautifully presented in every way and all the bathroom amenities were there. The hairdryer was powerful enough to dry long hair. The shampoo and conditioner were of quality and didn't leave my hair like straw which is unusual for hotel products. I adored the kitchenette which was fully stocked for actual eating and cooking food which is super so I didn't have to sit alone in a restaurant. The only thing that was annoying was the wardrobe door and bathroom door continually bumped into each other because of the room layout. the wardrobe was too small but I did book the night before and I am sure obtained a great rate so I wont be too picky.

The beach bag process was great although a bit tricky to understand. Yes it is free everyday and you obtain it from the Concierge  then return it post beach. It contains 2 towels (not really beach towels) water, fruit and sunscreen. I loved it but the sign at the desk says you can buy it for $25, paid to charity (bit confusing as I really didn't want to buy it as it was large and labeled), this is if you want to take it home, just like buying a bath robe.

The bus stop to take you to the Ala Moana shopping center was just up the road at a cost of $2 a trip. All other shops were in easy walking distance.

The Army museum was 100 meters away and free to cruise through which was really interesting and worth a walk around if you didn't have time to go on a long tourist bus trip.

So I had a super stay alone in Hawaii and all my needs were met by the hotel and their lovely staff.","Date of stay: September 2015","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We got a great rate on Wotif. The room was spacious . The parents had a seperate bedroom/ bathroom/ balcony. Both my kids had a fold out double  bed in the living area, with another balcony/ kitchen/ bathroom. Everyone was happy!
Having a kitchen and laundry facilities was a god send with the Aussie Dollar.
The food at breakfast was good, staff very attentive, cleaners thorough, and steak restaurant also good.
Only negative that it wasn't on Waikiki beach( short walk) and the air con wasn't quite cool enough on the coolest setting( plus the air con must have been a bit dusty ) as both my husband and I suffered from sinus while we stayed there and are allergic to dust.

Hats off to the concierge desk (Gemma could not help enough).

Unfortunately on check-in our room was not available (as we arrived in the morning). We were told it would not be available until 2pm (5 hours away), however for $100 per night plus tax we could upgrade. We were very tired and just wanted to rest, so we felt like this was the only option, no other solution was provided. We found out that other guests had the same problem and it left a bad taste with us. Maybe the policy is to clean the premium rooms first or simply make more money out of guests? 

We chatted to our travel agent on our return and they said that they had received the same feedback that Trump always pushes the upgrades at check-in when rooms are not ready. 

I just felt cheated as we paid thousands of dollars to stay here, I wish I had checked in at 2pm and this review would have been 5 star","Date of stay: October 2015","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

Service
The service is phenomenal. It is some of the best service we have ever received anywhere in the world. Book all your tours through concierge. They are sincere, diligent and professional. They know their stuff and most importantly they are focused on the best fit for you and making sure you have a good time. They are not just focused on the sale. They send you confirmation letters so you can plan it all out and you do not need to rely on your memory. 

We received exceptional service from Mai and Gemma. In fact we can't speak highly enough of Mia. She took all the mystery and stress out of the process and she ensured we had all the information and checked in with is after our tours to see how things went. 

Food
The food is great. In Yo is very nice, try the spring rolls. BLT is a phenomenal steak place. We had one of the best steak meals we've ever had there and we've tried most of the great steak restaurants in the U.S. 

Rooms
They are small! Surprisingly small. They are luxurious and well equipped but small. If you want space you should call ahead and request a descriptor of the rooms. We reserved a suite. As it was our honeymoon we got an upgrade. The room we ended up in was an average sized hotel room with a kitchen. I would hate to have seen what we paid for before the upgrade. 

Breakfast
It's a bit overpriced but it is convenient. The staff don't seem to have the knack of accommodating the needs of all guests. They will seat a couple on their honeymoon and then seat a family with small restless children right next to them. In fact that was one core observation. If we wanted to have a romantic meal or drink we had to go elsewhere. The hotel was full of young families and the staff did not seem to be able think about the desire couples might have to be away from small children. It seemed to us to be more of a family hotel. We probably wouldn't return as they don't cater well for couples. Even when you ask for some consideration someone will seat kids who would rather be at McDonalds right next to you. It's a shame because the service is otherwise brilliant. In fact the service was so good it left us unprepared for the service we revived outside the hotel. 

The Beach
The beach is a short walk and there is a service provider call Aqualina that services the Trump guests. It is not obvious and is a bit hard to find and there are no signs. We found the guy behind the desk Melvino to be rude, patronizing and condescending so be prepared for that. If you are expecting the same courteous and professional service you get at the hotel you are going to be shocked. The beach is not good for swimming as it is very rocky. I suggest you go further east.","Date of stay: October 2015","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

There are 1000 tiny things that make a hotel great.  Trump has all 1000!  I will list a bunch for my review based on my stay in a suite. 

1.  Location: close to the beach and close to the shops and main area of Waikiki
2.  The check-in was seamless
3.  The hotel hallways are carpeted to keep down the noise
4.  The bathroom is large with every amenity 
5.  Toto Washlet Toilet. 
6.  The room is large. 
7.  The balcony has heavy sliding doors with thick glass to keep out noise
8.  The kitchen sink is deep. 
9.  The bar sized fridge makes ice
10.  The beds are very comfortable and high quality as is all of the furniture and linens.
11.  Impeccable service with a smile
12. The Mai Tai at the pool
13.  BLT steakhouse is downstairs
14. beach bag, towel, and fruit provided for your trip to the beach.
15.  Even the hotel-provided toiletries are top notch and not offensive in scent. 

So I decided to stop at 15. 

Just book it and enjoy.","Date of stay: September 2015","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

What a treat it was!  From the moment I arrived and was welcomed back by Dean the Door Man to the moment I reluctantly left, the staff could not do enough to ensure my stay was five star.  My room was superb and the view over Fort de Russy to the ocean was everything I'd hoped it would be. Seeing the fireworks on Friday night was just a lovely touch, and the staff laughed when I thanked them for putting those on to celebrate my birthday.

What I love about staying there (apart from the staff) are the room amenities.  My room had a full kitchen, so I could stay in if I chose.  Bottled water appeared every morning and evening during the turn down service.  And the hotel itself is an absolute oasis.  The pool may be a bit on the small side, but nothing beats the view from there.

While I was there, I enquired about staying in January and was shown different suites by Crystal & Mitchiko, who were both happy to assist me.  As a result of that, I've booked a 7 night stay in one of the superb two bedroom suites and I couldn't be happier that I'll be back there soon, to celebrate my niece graduating high school.

Their ability to make you feel so welcome & remember your name/room is super impressive. Special mention to the staff poolside too, always making sure we had cocktails but never felt like we were being watched. And BLT steak on the final night...one of the highlights of the trip!

Booked a 2 brm suite and got upgraded to the premium suite facing the beach and Hilton.  Location is great.  The beach is so close and the main shopping street is just a couple of blocks away.

The room was very spacious and we had everything we needed.  From dishwashing liquid to washing powder and fabric softener sheets.  We travelled with our 2 boys (3y and 4m) they even prepared a toy each for them, colouring books, baby bath products and wipes, kids size bath robe and slippers.  What impressed me the most was they even prepared a stepping stool for our toddler so he can reach the tab to wash his hands.  How thoughtful!!!  Staff were friendly and helpful, just what you would expect from a 5 star hotel.

There were 2 air conditioning controls but the main vent was located at the guest bedroom, where our boys were staying.  It could be very cold in there while it's still warm in the lounge.  Pay a bit more attention if you're travelling with kids.

There's only 1 small infinity pool.  It's not a family resort type accommodation but we visited during low season (I think) so it was not very crowded.  Our 3year boy loved it!  Breakfast was OK, they had all the standard choices available.  Room service was not bad our boy loved the kids meals.

From even before we left NY when I contacted the concierge with some questions until we left after a 5 night stay, there was not one person working for the hotel who did not make us feel like we were special and that it was their pleasure to get us what we needed. The hotel was full when we arrived, so we could not be upgraded until our fourth night, but both rooms, a partial ocean view and an ocean view were wonderful in every way.

Our first stay was for a week in 2013 with our eldest daughter who was nearly 2 at the time. The online concierge to tailor your stay even before you arrive is a welcome bonus.  We were upgraded to a 2 bedroom suite on arrival, which set the tone for our entire stay. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff were about the most attentive and friendly of any I have experienced. The room and amenities were fantastic and the attention to detail the icing on the cake. The beds are super comfortable (choose your preferred pillow from a menu) and the bathrooms superb with deep, deep soaking tubs in the main.

Our second stay was about 17 Months later in 2014 when my eldest daughter was 3 and our second daughter only 11 Months.  It was a shorter stay of only 4 nights and we booked a 2 bedroom suite.  When we arrived from our previous hotel, our room wasn't quite ready to check into and so we were given a smaller room to relax in while ours was being prepared. 30 minutes later, our room was ready and they arrived with the keys and our bags to be delivered to the room.  Unfortunately we had a hurricane pass through while we were there but if there is a good place to be holed up in for a few days in Honolulu, then this isn't a bad option.  

Having your own kitchen and food deliveries available is definitely handy when you have young kids!  If it lacks anything from a family perspective, it is a child friendly pool or resort style area. If you can live without that (given you are 2 mins from the beach), even if only for a few days, I highly recommend you treat yourself a stint there.

We love staying at the Trump Waikiki.  My wife jokes that I am in love with it.  She's right, just a little bit...","Date of stay: October 2014","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The Trump Waikiki is an excellent hotel. Yes, it’s not on the beach front and it’s not a resort hotel, but the beach is across the road and as a couple with no children we did not want a resort (we wanted a home from home and that’s what we got). What makes this hotel special is the high level of customer service and the quality of the rooms, this has resulted in us booking another stay at the Tump in 2015.

Arrival – a warm welcome from the staff and clear explanation of the facilities etc.

Food – the hotel food options are good , BLT (steak) is amazing. Great quality food. However, Waikiki has myraids of places to eat hence, you don’t have to dine at the hotel.

Pool– small pool but who needs a pool when the beach is across the road.

Room – phenomenal. We have stated in the one bed room suite and the good points were;
•	Rom size
•	Nice sea view
•	Washer dryer – excellent for us as we came from the UK and were on a three / four week trip
•	Kitchen – we enjoy cooking hence, it was nice to be able to cook for ourselves using local products.
•	Clean
•	Modern

We have not stayed in the smaller non beach view rooms hence, we cant compare these.

Excursions  / trips – we only booked surfing lessons via the hotel. The hotel made an excellent selection of recommending Ty gurney surf school as they were attentive and we ended up booking morning lessons every day for each of our stays. 

Would we recommend this hotel  - yes, in a heartbeat and we are hoping that our 2015 stay is just as good. If it was not for the hospitality of the staff at the Trump and the enchanting island of Oahu we would not be making a point of re-visiting the island year after year.","Date of stay: June 2015","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We were personally greeted on arrival and ushered straight to check in.  No waiting at all, and we were upgraded to a spectacular larger suite than the one we had booked.  We were shown to our room immediately, our bags were delivered promptly and then the porter took the time to show us the features of the suite.  We then received a welcome phone call from the manager, along with a welcome gift of Honolulu cookies.  Amazing service and hospitality.  The suite was absolutely divine and had everything you needed and more.  Complimentary wifi and endless bottles of water left in the fridge were much appreciated.  Housekeeping came in twice a day, addressed us by name every single time, serviced the room to a perfect standard - towels and linen were refreshed constantly.  The beach bags with towels, water, fruit and sunscreen are very much appreciated, and the pool side staff are wonderful providing fresh towels and offering drinks and snacks.  Pool area is gorgeous, but a little small when it gets busy.  The tour desk staff are incredibly helpful and were quick to make and confirm arrangements.  Hotel is in a fab location - out the door is an endless array of shopping & restaurants and the beach is right across the road.  Overall a wonderful stay and we can't wait to go back.","Date of stay: June 2015","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Our room, which included a kitchen, a washer/dryer, two baths, a living room with balcony and two bedrooms, was routinely cleaned and refreshed with towels and linens by late afternoon.  On the 32nd floor, our eastern facing windows just managed to look over the massive Sheraton two blocks away for a cropped upper view of Diamond Head and the surfers, paddle boarders and catamarans off of Waikiki Beach far below.  

In general, the decor is condominium-like with high-end fixtures and ""durable"" furnishings all under a relatively low ceiling, which was probably a function of squeezing in as many floors as possible under a restrictive height limit.  We tried to make dinner in the room one evening but found that the burners would not produce enough heat to boil water after a 45 minute test of patience.  We did not call room service to fix this problem since it was very late and we were more interested in Plan B, which was a meal out nearby.

The Wai’Olu Lounge on the reception level, six floors above the street (parking fills the first five floors) offered small plates and cocktails with sunset views and, on Fridays, a comfortable location from which to watch the weekly fireworks at the Hilton Hawaiian Village just beyond Fort Derussy Park.  Our meal here was our only dining experience at the hotel, but it was perfect for our first night after a long day of travel.  The inventive, tapas-like entrees are fun to share – especially the flatbreads and any fish-centered dish - and the live music enjoyable and unobtrusive.

Although the beach is a 250-yard walk away and across a moderately busy street, the hotel will provide you with a pre-packaged beach bag with towels, water and a snack.   The beaches here are very crowded and, as can be expected in an urban setting, far from anyone’s vision of a tropical experience.  However, the water is warm and shallow, the waves gentle and the diverse population of locals and tourists entertaining.  An evening stroll west to the Hilton or east to the Moana Surfrider is a treat with a back-stage glimpse of each property’s nightly waterfront show.

Honolulu has come a long way with its restaurant selections, offering a variety of trendy, adventurous and Pacific regional cuisines in many different neighborhoods.  We had an excellent lunch at the Vietnamese-styled Pig and the Lady in Chinatown, reserved for us by the concierge.  We recommend taking a morning off and visiting the Art Museum, which also offers an intimate tour of Doris Duke’s estate on the east side of Diamond Head (tickets online).  The Byodo-In Temple, on the north side of the island is also a beautiful and contemplative place to enjoy a garden break from the frenetic pace of the city.  

The Trump is a centrally located and luxurious base from which to explore these many attractions.","Date of stay: August 2015","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I have been to many international hotels of five star around the world, but I will not rank this hotel as 5 star.

Yes, hotel was clean, customer service was good, but the following points I want to highlight:

1. The windows are not double glazed. So if your sleep is light, then you will have difficulty. We were on the 15th floor but noises of the car, people were heard in the room.

2. There was not much of a view, so you are facing an ugly building.

3. The slippers in the room stink. Literally stink!!! When you open the slippers plastic it is like a rotten fish. You will get unconscious from the terrible smell.

4. At the reception they told us we got a complimentary upgrade from a king size bed to a twin room. We were 2 friends and we had requested a twin room. If you see the photos of the twin room, the bed will not fit if you are tall or if you are fat. Looked more like a coffin bed.

5. Next to the bed there was a huge electricity board inbuilt into the wall. So if you are an engineer and have free time, you can enjoy your time playing with the box before going to bed.

The hotel has a plaque at the reception from forbes, one of the finest hotels in the world. To me it is not even near one of the finest. It is overrated.","Date of stay: August 2015","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

But five stars are about the details...","First off, I will preface by saying I'm a tough reviewer.   I have experience traveling and have stayed at some of the best hotels and some of the worst (Four seasons down to a motel 6).  So five stars to me is when everything is absolutely perfect.  1 star is downright horrible.  

Second preface:  I won't comment on Trump the person.   I'm dissociating this from his political views.  I'm not going to go into that in detail.

Pros:  The hotel itself is beautiful.  It doesn't do the Hawaii tourist thing - where everything is set up to look like a hut in the middle of an Island.  The decor is wonderful and modern.  The lobby is located on a higher floor near the pool and a restaurant.  This lobby/pool/restaurant is amazing - as it looks out onto Waikiki beach and the ocean.  

The service is impeccable.  I would say one of the best service experiences I have ever had, even close to the St. Regis in Manhattan.  An example - my girlfriend lost her passport and the concierge/security/manager spent an amazing amount of time working with Hawaii Police and eventually tracked it down.  They searched every beach bag.  Speaking of beach bags - they provided us with a beach bag everytime we went to the beach.  This included water, sunscreen, and beach towels.   Perfect.

The food is great as well.  Both restaurants we sampled were wonderful. BLT Steak is a 4.25/5 star restaurant for me.  5 star being French Laundry/Baume that we have in SF.  

Locale is good - its near the beach and near a lot of shopping.  So getting to both was easy.

Cons:
My big con - the internet.  This kept me from giving Trump 5 stars.  I know I'm on vacation, but I still have work to get done.  To save time between going to the beach and restaurants and driving to the North Shore, I need to quickly access work and do what I need to do quickly.  

The problem is that they have a complimentary wifi service, which nets you about a 1mps download speeds... which isn't enough in this day and age.  I called and complained, and lo and behold, they have a ""upgraded internet"" that they never tell you about and charge an extra 14.95 a day.  This upgraded interent allows only 1 person to log on to it.  So I couldn't run any other laptops/devices on it.

Even the ""upgraded"" showed significant slowing depending on traffic in/out of the hotel.  It was a nuisance.  When I complained twice, all I got was, well it is what it is.  In addition, on checkout I complained about it and the guy just looked at me blankly.

Another issue is the workout facility.  Completely small and inadequate for a place this size and catering to the clientele it wants to.  I depend on hotel gyms for my fitness/health on my travels and this was 2/5 stars.  They're not alone, the Ritz in LA is about the same.  I'm not sure why super nice hotels don't have equivalent nice fitness centers.

Other con:  It's not ""on the beach.""  You have to walk through another hotel to get to the beach, but that was a minor con.  I wouldn't say it was a big issue.  

In conclusion, the Trump is a great hotel.  However, it's not a five star.  I reserve five star hotels for something like the St. Regis in NYC.   It was close, but not quite there but I still recommend it for people going to Waikiki.","Date of stay: August 2015","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

We had booked a two bed ocean view suite with den but on checking in, we were delighted with an upgrade to a three bedrooms ocean front suite on the 28th floor.  That put an end to the battle between my son and daughter as to who was getting the bedroom and who was getting the den!

The suite was huge and we thoroughly enjoyed the space, layout and wonderful vista.

We have stayed at the Trump previously and out main reason for returning was the standard of the service at the hotel and we were as pleased with it this time, as we were last.  

We enjoyed the pool, waiting until a little later in the evening meant that it was quieter and we could watch the sunset.  The lounge is excellent - try the bento box for lunch if you get a chance!  We had cocktails there a few times too, which were excellent.  

Room service was a bit weaker than expected with the pasta dishes we ordered being very heavy and cloying. That was the only minor issue with our whole stay.  

Beach bags are excellent, water availability very good, with water left during the day in the fridge and at night at the bedside, and also available from the valet too if leaving for the day.

Valet service was efficient.  

We have reached that stage in life where one feels that holidays with our children are numbered as they will soon be off travelling independently of us and so it is important to us that we get quality holiday experiences with them now and the Trump certainly helped to deliver that in abundance!

All in all, a fabulous stay; thank you to all the Trump staff!","Date of stay: July 2015","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Beautiful, serene, with understated but over the top service if that conundrum makes any sense.  I've stayed a few times at the Outrigger Reef which is literally across the street.  While also nice, and on the beach, it isn't as upscale as the Trump and sometimes the rates are virtually identical.  I guess the nicest other hotel I've stayed at has been the JW Marriott Ihilani on the Western side of Oahu.

Trump hotel and staff seem to have thought ahead of time about what you would need and the nice touches abound everywhere.  I'm here for my 39th birthday and the property manager sent up a fruit plate which was excellent and very thoughtful.  I believe we also got upgraded to a deluxe studio with a supposed 'city view' on the 14th floor but if your neck has a turning radius of at least 30 degrees you have a pretty good ocean view!  Room 1410.

Every staff member i've contacted is very nice, smiling, and offers to assist with anything to make you happy.  Turn down service occurs every night.  I'd like to give shout outs to Dean in the valet department and Auhaki a pool attendant.  I noticed a small 'ding' in my rental car which I did not notice at time of pick up and I pointed it out to Dean who asked to see our rental car contract and then wrote a note on it for us and said if we have any issues to have them contact him!  Great and friendly service!  Auhaki was very pleasant to chat with and welcomed me back to the pool daily and put a towel cover on my lounge chair.

The other fine details abound.  I also found the prices for food to be very reasonable and it didn't feel like the hotel was trying to nickle and dime you for everything.  Plenty of water bottles abound at no charge and if you visit one of the bathrooms near the lobby they are stocked with nice shaving razors and mouthwash!  I got a free razor that would have been like $4 at the ABC store.  Pretty cool.

This place is spotlessly clean and flawlessly managed.  I can't wait to come back and stay again.  Aloha.","Date of stay: August 2015","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Big highlight was the beach service from Melvino and Logan who looked after us like guests, ensuring we had the best spots, giving us local insights and helping us with our activities eg the lovely Holokai boat trip.
The room was beautiful, overlooking the beach. A balcony would be nice next time. It would also be good to have a full length mirror in the room, the only one is in the bathroom. Loved the little kitchen. And we absolutely LOVED the turndown service!!!! Felt very spoilt.

I decided to book the in-house Wai'olo Ocean View Lounge for a view of the fireworks, your staff put us in the best spot in the restaurant to view the fireworks, then the food, it is mostly a tapas menu but it was absolutely delicious , once dinner was finished we asked to see a dessert menu, while waiting the chef brought out a slice of dessert on a board with Happy Anniversary written in chocolate. That wasn't the only good service we were given, the staff at concierge were all so friendly and helpful, they gave us bottles of water anytime of day, booked tours for us! I can't wait for my next stay at a Trump Hotel.","Date of stay: August 2015","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I am voting for Trump!","We checked in on 8-2  and from the second we pulled up the the entrance we were greeted with nothing but professionalism!!! The staff was unbelievable! So nice to be treated like family.  Our room was beautiful with an ocean view to die for. We were so pleased with it, we extended our stay. The staff at the pool, Nichole and Aukaihi, ready to be at your service, we're very helpful with making sure we had everything we needed to have a nice pool stay, the drinks were perfect . The breakfast at In-Yo was just as good. Our wait help was the best. Cathy remembered exactly how I liked my coffee, eggs and extras from our day before eating with them.  Then we hade dinner at BLT. Chris was our waiter. He really we the extra mile, I forgot my reading glasses, and he came back to the table with A little light with magnifier reader! Saved the day!! One thing at the end of my comments that I would like to say is that the pool was very overcrowded and unregulated by security, kids were running around jumping splashing swimming and took over the whole pool. It was so bad one little boy slipped and fell down and hit his head and the parents didn't even know. They were all Asian family's with no regard for anyone else at the pool. Overall I would give it a five star rating love the property. It was not the staffs fault, my recommendation is divide the pool in half or make a kid friendly zone!","Date of stay: August 2015","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Stayed here twice in July, the first time I was bumped heavily up to a huge suite with ocean views. Fully equipped with huge lounge, two bathrooms and fully fitted kitchen with luxury white goods. Also a full washing machine and dryer which came in very useful. Staff were wonderful and the room was spotless and kept brilliantly clean and tidy even though we were less than tidy.

As the hotel is more of a tower than a resort there is not a lot of room for the bar or pool so they feel slightly shoe horned onto the property. Oddly they wont let you order drinks from the lounge area though you can drink there, you just have to order your own drinks. 

The hotel is not beach front but is a short walk away. They provide a fantastic beach bag with towels, water and fruit and even sun cream. Valet parking is courteous and efficient but it is expensive at $35 a day.","Date of stay: July 2015","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The views out to the ocean and down to the park (complete with Army Museum) below were great from our balcony & separate bedroom.  The apartment was very well equipped and beautifully furnished, with lots of little extras & treats to enjoy - fresh ground coffee & water bottles every day.  The Trump is very conveniently located, but not in the noisiest/busiest part of Waikiki so we were not kept awake by all the nightly dance music and street noise.  We could walk easily to the shops, beach, bus, cafes and restaurants and even the large Ala Moana Shopping Complex was about a 20-30 minute walk away.  The welcome we received was lovely after our long flight and we felt right at home from the moment we arrived till we checked out a week later.  The path to the beach is just across the road and the tours that we went on, picked us up on the opposite side at the Outrigger on the Reef Hotel as it's a regular pick-up location for tours.

I arrived at the hotel very early in the morning without notice and the staff was able to give me access to my room by 9 AM and upgrade me for no additional charge. The room was spacious and clean. The bathroom was very nice if not a little unusual. (Want to shower in an open layout in front of a giant mirror?) The spa was small but the service was excellent. The breakfast buffet and room service were very good if not overpriced but its expected at a hotel like this.

On the negative side, the elevator key access was unreliable. Several times I had to use the fire escape stairs to get to my room after being stuck in the elevator for five minutes. The Wifi was so slow as to be unusable. I had to use cell tethering. Finally, I wouldn't be comfortable staying here again given the recent comments made by Mr. Trump on minorities. They are certainly not reflective of the wonderful and diverse staff at this property.

Its contemporary, sleek, stylish interiors created a luxurious atmosphere.  We received warm, attentive service from the bell staff and front desk.  The lobby is up on the sixth floor – a bit odd but the good news is that you get views overlooking the park to the ocean from the outdoor patio.  Our studio room was spacious with floor to ceiling glass, marble bathrooms and luxurious Trump bathroom potions and lotions.  I’m guessing the larger suites and condos are fantastic and have no peer in Waikiki.  Since we were at the end of the hall, our room looked directly at the Outrigger across the street which made us feel less than private.  There were lots of cool appliances but I could’ve used a manual to operate some of them.  The hallways felt narrower and more plain than you’d expect from a Trump hotel.  We ate dinner at the BLT steakhouse on the ground floor – very good though not excellent and definitely not cheap (though their oversized hot gruyere popovers were out of this world and reason alone to eat there).  You’re not on the beach here, and the several block walk drops you off at a sea wall section of Waikiki, not the world class sands to the east.  Personally, I prefer to spend less and stay at the historic Moana Surfrider high up in their oceanfront tower with panoramic views and a picturesque garden terrace directly on the sand, but staying at the Trump ain’t bad, and being newer definitely has its advantages.","Date of stay: July 2015","Trip type: Traveled on business","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

The bathrooms and amenities are 5 star.  The staff are friendly and accommodating - nothing is too much trouble. Our room on the 30th floor had lovely views of the ocean and Waikiki. The best part about staying in the hotel is their concierge/beach bag service.  Collect your beach bag containing towels, sunscreen, water and fruit before you head to the beach then return the sandy towels and bag on your way back to the room.  Bliss!  This hotel is pricey but you get what you pay for.  The restaurant/bar on the lobby level has a great happy hour and delicious food.  You must try their Mai Tai - voted best in the world.

We spent 12 nights at this fabulous hotel. The hotel is located a very short distance away from the main shopping strip, restaurants and other major, well known hotels. It is much smaller as well which has advantages. In the first 48 hours of our stay however, after visiting other hotels for lunch, drinks and generally exploring, we wondered if Trump was the best hotel for us, mainly because the other hotels looked luxurious with stunning decor, impeccable tropical landscaping, were located right on the beach, had an upbeat holiday atmosphere and a lower tariff! As our stay progressed though we found these other hotels lacked the class, personalised service and attention to detail that Trump provided. At Trump we were always addressed by name & we felt as if the staff were there only for our benefit!
Our ocean view suite was located on the 11th floor. It was large, had two balconies and was beautifully appointed with a twice daily maid service. The rooms are immaculately clean. Unfortunately traffic noise was noticeable so our balcony doors remained closed.
The pool is small, but again this has advantages because though busy, it never really became overcrowded. The pool service was exceptional especially from Kodai who was always willing to provide service with efficiency and a beaming smile. This young man fulfils his role with such exemplary dedication, he is a great asset to the business.

The greeting was so warm with each of us receiving a shell lei, cold water and cool face washers. We had a deluxe ocean view studio suite with a king bed and queen sofa bed. The room was big, the bathroom huge and the kitchen state of the art with cooktop, big bar fridge and microwave as well as all the utensils, pots and pan you would need. The deep soaking tub was very relaxing and the bathroom products beautiful. Two sinks was very handy for a family! The view from our balcony of the ocean was spectacular and sitting at the chairs and table out there for breakfast made it worth it to have a deluxe suite with the balcony rather than just windows. The service was so friendly without being over the top. Housekeeping, the concierge and pool attendants and just everyone we came across was so friendly and asked about your day etc. we spent at least a couple of hours each day at the pool. It did get crowded sometimes but early in the day or late afternoon seemed to be quieter. The pool attendants were great and we ate and I had a mai tai by the pool a couple of times. The food was just yummy, well beyond simple pool snacks. The Thai style children wings were the best. I think because you could see Waikiki beach and the ocean from the pool, it didn't feel like we were wasting time because we were still very  clearly in Hawaii. We absolutely loved our stay at trump and found it family friendly with the kitchen to make breakfast in and trump kids activities available though we didn't do these. There is an ABC store 200 meters away and Starbucks across  the road for coffee. The beach is maybe 300 meters away. We were sad to leave trump and would love to go back someday.

Developmental points first: Arriving off a late night flight from Auckland with two young children we were looking forward to the welcome everyone has written about.... While friendly, the staff could have been a little more efficient with check in, a glass of water and showing us to our room. The washing machine proved extremely problematic, four visits over four days to get it working properly, that all got a little tiresome. 

OK - the good bits, and there were plenty of them... The rooms are very well appointed, the kitchen area is the best I have experienced. Great for families who want to self cater. The laundry, when the washing machine worked, was a bonus - anyone travelling with kids will really appreciate this. Bathrooms were very well appointed and restocked a couple of times a day. The staff were very helpful, and attentive - Mahalo to the concierge team, always making sure we had water and beach bags (what a great idea!).

We had traveled some time and when we arrived at 10 am thought we would have the whole day but we were told our room was not ready yet and was being cleaned. We were told we would be called but after 4 hours there was no phone call and when I did call I was told the room was not ready. When I finally returned to the lobby I was told the room had ""just"" become available. We waited until 3 pm wasting our whole day to get a room. Surely a 5 star hotel could have found us a single room or offered a hospitality suite to at least change or freshen up. That was a bad start and it was followed by a broken toilet for which the manager did graciously upgrade our room and he was very good and made up for the check in lady's lack of concern for getting our room in the first place. The room was stunning though with a gorgeous view of the ocean and made the stay worth it since the beach was a walk. The drinks were bad and over priced and the pool entirely inappropriate for a 5 star hotel. U have to walk to the beach about 5 minutes and at the end of the day it was not worth staying there. I would recommend the Royal Hawaiian which is directly on the beach and has beautiful grounds and pool. The concierge and manager were very great, checked in with us to make sure the rest of our stay was good and did make up for the bad start and because of them the stay was pleasant. That being said, Mr Trump's recent remarks on television will prohibit me and my friends from staying at any Trump property in the future which is a shame considering the staff at the hotel other than our check in lady were wonderful and very helpful.","Date of stay: May 2015","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

Concierge very helpful, accurate information - Mai, Jennifer, Gemma, Kim, and everyone there. Very friendly, excellent advice. They made our trip very fruitful with their valuable and accurate information. 

Will definitely recommend the Trump to our friends, and will stay with you when we next come to Hawaii.","Date of stay: June 2015","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

BEST.IDEA.EVER.!!  Outstanding service by all employees, convenient location to great restaurants, shopping and most important, the beach.  The staff was so welcoming and went beyond our expectations to ensure our stay was perfect.  While the rooms are a bit pricier than most hotels in the area, it was worth every penny of what we paid.  We choose this hotel mainly because EVERY hotel on the island had extra charges/fees for everything from valet service, daily resort fees, beach chair fees, towel fees, extra person fees...and Trump did NOT.  We paid a fee for our car valet service which we had no issue with ($17 per day seemed fair in comparison to other hotels).  Our room was very comfortable with a great kitchen and plenty of room for the 5 of us.  We will for sure stay here again and highly recommend!","Date of stay: June 2015","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The staff working at the hotel is exceptional and will go out of their way to satisfy the guests.

Only negative part of the stay was that we could buy break fast vouchers while  checking in ($ 33 per adult ) but if not used the hotel would not adjust against any other expense except related to breakfast which i believe should be reviewed .
Special mention to Irena at the restaurant and Mai and Jennifer at the concierge desk for making our stay special.

I know check in is not until 4:00pm so I had my fingers crossed I could get an early check in.  Not only did I get checked in early, but I got upgraded to a 3 bedroom, ocean front room on the 27th floor.  The service at this hotel is top notch, if you even hint or look like you need something when walking through the lobby, there is someone assisting you.  Very polite and sincere staff.  Beds were comfy, and rooms were clean and bright.  Short walk to the beach, and at the concierge desk, they give you a beach bag that has towels, fruit, water and sunscreen in it.

We arrived at the hotel very early in the morning and Matthew at the font desk took very good care of us. He provided us a temporary room so we could get some sleep after the red eye from Tahiti. My wife wasn't feeling to good and she called down to reception to see if there were any doctor's locally. she provided my wife with some names and 20 minutes later she delivered a cup of hot water with tea and honey for my wife with a get well soon card. Very impressive and have never seen this type of attention to detail and customer service from any other hotel. 
Once our room was ready they took our bags and got us checked in. We ended up in room 3001 and it was spectacular.
A corner unit with views of wakiki, the city and diamond head. truly amazing. It was a 2 bedroom 2 bath apartment with dining room and full kitchen with all high end appliances. I felt as though we could have just moved in. Truly amazing. 
Concierge was able to get us reservations at a nice Italian restaurant. The breakfast was phenomenal especially eating outdoors with the ocean breeze. 
Because it was our 25th anniversary we received a nice card and a bottle of champagne which we thoroughly enjoyed on our deck overlooking wakiki and watching a rainbow.
This is definitely a first class hotel with a 5 star staff. Looking forward to visiting again.

This year, we decided to bring our two teenagers with us.  The Trump Waikiki was our choice due to the location and size of the 1-bedroom suite with extra den (1 King and 2 foldout sofas).  It was the perfect choice!  We thought the property was beautiful and our suite was outstanding with gorgeous ocean views from our living area and master bedroom and bath!  The only negative of the room would be that the sun is so hot during the day that we had to keep our blinds closed when we were gone in order to keep the room cool.  It turned out not to be a big problem, and we did have gorgeous sunsets from our balcony.  However, we spent most evenings watching the sunset from the beach or at the lounge on the 5th floor.

The suite had two bathrooms, which was very convenient, and was equipped with a full kitchen with Wolf appliances.  There was also a stackable washer/dryer in the Master Bedroom walk-in closet that came in very handy.  We were able to wash workout clothes during our stay and before heading home, which was SO nice.

We were greeted with leis as we dropped off our car, and were brought to the Lobby on the 5th floor.  We were offered fruit-infused water and a cold washcloth to freshen up.  After check-in we headed upstairs to find a ""Happy Birthday"" dessert waiting for us along with a box of shortbread from the Honolulu Cookie Company and popcorn for the kids. Kona Coffee, herbal teas and bottled water were replenished daily.  There was regular housekeeping service along with turndown service, where the upscale toiletries (i.e., sugar scrub, body butter and bath salts, etc.) were generously replenished.

I cannot go on enough about the impeccable service! The valet knew our name the 1st time we returned to the hotel, and were always so friendly. Housekeeping, without question, exchanged one of our sleeper sofas for a rollaway and replaced our Master mattress with a pillow top with one phone call!  We mentioned the way our room wouldn't cool down and an engineer appeared, who overrode the thermostat controls to lower the temperature for us.  

Gemma, from concierge, was extremely patient and helpful in planning a Catamaran tour at the last minute, which we loved!  (It was a boat called ""Island Magic"" and we were 3 of only 4 passengers who got to spend 2.5 hours swimming with the Sea Turtles at Turtle Canyon!)   Each time we headed to the beach, or to the car to drive to Kailua or the North Shore, we were given a bag filled with towels, waters, sunscreen and fruit.  Even as we went out for our daily walk we were offered water and sunscreen!

I know several reviews were not positive about the pool area, but I have to disagree.  We were at the hotel from 5/29-6/6, and only once had an experience when it was overly crowded.  And, that only lasted a few hours.  We didn't mind the shade at all, because the infiniti pool was in the sun.  There were also chaises in full sun available on the terraces to the side of the pool.  My teenagers and I could find 3 chairs together every time we visited, which was almost daily.  

I must single out Kodai, who worked at the pool.  He was the friendliest and most welcoming of all the employees we encountered at the Trump, and that's saying a lot!  He always used our name to welcome and thank us for our visit.  I must say I was astonished to find he had only started working at the hotel 1 day prior to our arrival!  Whatever you are doing to attract and train your staff, keep it up!  

The restaurants are very good, if a bit pricey.  We had a wonderful dinner at BLT and several small plates at WAI-OLU Lounge.  They have pretty sunset views and good prices on menu items from 3-6pm.  Breakfast at In-Yo cafe was very good, although we had breakfast in our room most days, since we had a full kitchen.  We were walking distance to so many good restaurants for lunch and dinner.  And, my daughter loved the shopping!

I would go back in a heartbeat!","Date of stay: May 2015","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

But then maybe this is what makes it such a unique one, cause only excellence is what we got! From the very beginning of our stay until the very end. 

Everyone went out of their way to help us and be of service, their rooms were nicely furnished and well equipped, their breakfast was lovely and absolutely delish, their Mai Tai was just perfect (not too strong not to bland) and their BLT Steak fine dining restaurant's food was superb, their whole fried fish a must have!!!

This was our first overseas trip with a baby and we felt very well looked after. We upgraded to a one bedroom suite which included a washing machine and dryer. Laundry detergent was also provided. While we had our own travel cot and therefore did not request one, the hotel had one set up in our suite anyway which came in handy as a playpen. We also found a baby amenities pack and packets of baby wipes. Additional packets of wipes were provided gratis upon request. We used the small but well equipped kitchen for cooking simple meals and heating up food for our baby. Even though we had a partial ocean view suite, we still had a great view of the beach from our lanai.

The room was very clean and quiet, and the staff were unfailingly friendly and courteous. Wifi was complimentary and the welcome box of cookies from Honolulu Cookie Company was a very nice touch.

The bathroom had two sinks, a shower and a bath with an assortment of towels.  The shower did not have a shower door so we had to be a bit careful to make sure water did not go all over the bathroom!

The hotel was in a good location - just a few minutes' walk from the beach and close to the shops and restaurants.  There was a trolley stop a few steps away to take you directly to the Ala Moana shopping centre on the pink line (for just $2 - you must have the right change).  When you go to the beach, you can pick up a beach bag with beach towels, bottles of water, sun cream and fresh fruit inside - very handy!  We did not spend any time at the pool - this was not very big and seemed to be quite crowded.  It was not really necessary anyway given the proximity to the beach.

About the distance to the beach, are 245 steps, 150 meters (492 feet), 3 minutes walking slowly, is not a problem to me.
They gave to us a room upgrade and a late check-late without charge.
Definitely will be my choice next time in Hawaii or where the Trump hotel is available.
The problem is:
You must go inside the tub to get a shower, is high, without curtain, with a short piece of glass to avoid water splash, but even taking care the floor will be awash. Very dangerous for old people.","Date of stay: May 2015","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

A lovely surprise, (although we were there in early May at a slower time) we appreciated the extra space and the gorgeous decor of the room that matched our taste.  This is the perfect base camp for travelers who want gentility and unassuming direction from a gracious staff. My spa visit was one of the most relaxing events of the week.  We wanted a classically sophisticated experience to celebrate our 20th Anniversary, and we got it. Surf lessons, car rentals, water, towels and dinner reservations were all happily attended to by the concierge staff, along with detailed helpful itineraries to explore the island.

The service from beginning to end was PERFECT. We were greeted with cold towels and a refreshing drink. I cannot fault this hotel apart from the size of the pool.  We stayed in a 3 bedroom Oceanfront apartment (high floor) which gave us great views. The hotel itself is situated a little further back from the beach but its only a 5 minute walk to the beach  The pool for such a big hotel is a little underwhelming. I cannot imagine what it would be like during the peak period. Don't like your chances in getting seating/sun beds, unless you turned up very early. Just not enough room around this area. The beach out the front is very rocky. A little further up looked better. The hotel provides free beach bags, supplied with towels, water, sun lotion & fruit which made going to the beach so very easy. Our overall experience was wonderful and I would definitely stay here again. An ABC shop is just around the corner so getting your supplies is excellent.

Never needed to rent a car and used UBER  and the bus service as needed.  The pool is not as luxurious as one would expect for the Trump.  Most of the lounges are under shade.  The room itself is well appointed with a desk, table and kitchenette.  They have a pillow menu but don't mention it to you.  I found out by reading online.  We asked for more coffee each day and it seems like if they were paying attention, they would just leave extra packets.  When we arrived a nice welcome gift was brought by, but should have been in the room when we checked in, as it was an interruption when it was delivered.  We had a nice terrace that overlooked the neighboring hotel.  It was very loud with the doors open but the Trump did a great job with a noise reduction for that area.  However, the door was extremely heavy and difficult to shut.  The buffet breakfast is overpriced and unimpressive.  It was traditional breakfast items such as pancakes, eggs, bacon, bagels, fruit with Asian options.  
The staff at the Trump is the reason to come back.  They are ALL friendly, professional and caring.  They greeted us from the we arrived and everyday thereafter.  They always had a smile on their faces and were very willing to help you with anything you need.  
Overall, I would stay at the Trump again if the price was right.  Would I advise Adults w/children to stay there? No Couples? yes.  People who want a nightlife at their hotel? No.  It's best suited for those who enjoy quiet luxury.","Date of stay: April 2015","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

(He is a huge reason for my 5 star review) Someone takes you up to the lobby where they give you cold towels to refresh and some fruit infused water. A perfect way to freshen up after a long plane ride. 

Our room was excellent.  Love having the comforts of home in a hotel room.  Stovetop, refrigerator, blender all at your fingertips.  Gorgeous bathroom and breathtaking views of the ocean. 

The service is top notch.  Caring, wonderful people who understand what luxury service is about.  Two days into our trip they knew our names, knew our likes and dislikes and were totally on point.  

If I was gonna give an area for improvement I would say the pool is just ok.  It's not large, it's not great for kids and the view is not great.  However, we are beach folks and everyday our beach bag filled with water, fresh fruit, sunscreen and towels made for perfect days. They even loaned us beach toys and an umbrella for my son!

I've never bothered to review any hotel before, but I feel the need to recommend this to anyone travelling with small children. 

We were holidaying with our almost 2 year old daughter, which in itself could be a daunting task! However the hotel was perfectly set up to accommodate us. 

We stayed in a Deluxe Studio Ocean View room, which has a large bedroom/lounge area, balcony, hallway leading onto a small but amply equipped kitchen area and large family bathroom. The large living area meant that we didn't feel cramped in to one room with our daughter's cot - there was plenty of space and it was very comfortable.

Having the kitchenette made a real difference. It meant that we could store and prepare milk and food for our daughter, and eat breakfast/lunch in our room when required so that our toddler could nap/and also to save us a little money on dining out.

The location of the hotel is excellent, close to the beach and main street for dining/shopping, and we had a fantastic ocean view that I could have stared at forever. 

They will also make you up a beach bag before you leave with towels, water, fruit and suncream. This is an excellent service and means that your room isn't constantly full of wet towels and sand. 

Excellent service as you would expect, kind and friendly staff and an all round brilliant holiday.

Yes it’s on the high end, but you truly get what you pay for. 

Service was top notch with all of the staff being friendly yet ultra-respectful and helpful from the bellboys, valet, front desk and housekeepers.   

Amenities such as beach bags, umbrellas when the tropical showers begin, bottled water, etc all add to the experience.   All our concerns were addressed by management immediately which is what one would expect…. Service is paramount! 

Bathrooms in deluxe studios and above are worth the splurge as they are large and uber luxurious with a tremendous soaking tub and shower area. 

Two items to take into consideration, but should not deter you from staying here. One downside is as a high rise property there is a small, yet beautiful infinity pool instead of the larger pools at neighboring resorts with sprawling properties.  The other is the size and equipment available in the gym, not what we were expecting from property of this caliber

It came with a beautiful light colored décor, super comfortable beds and bedding, a completely stocked kitchen with pots and pans and a washer/dryer combo.  The hotel toiletries went beyond the regular shampoo, conditioner and lotion.  Among other things, they included a sugar scrub, body butter and bath crystals.  Loved the soak tub!! And loved the beautiful white shell lei presented upon arriving. 

Saturday morning we went to the beach, which was one short block away.  Trump sent us off with a beach bag with towels, water, sunscreen and fruit! Who does that?!

Service was exceptional.","Truly enjoyed our stay at this property. We had a two bedroom suite which was extremely comfortable and perfect for our family. Of the suites, I believe we had the smallest floorplan with supposedly the least favorable view of what they offer, and we felt the suite was one of the most spacious we have ever stayed in and the panoramic view of Waikiki beach and the Honolulu skyline really lovely. The toiletries in the room were plentiful and thoughtful such as the bath crystals, sugar scrubs, body butter etc. The beach bags the concierge packed for us were fantastic.  Even though the hotel is not directly on the beach, in my opinion this doesn't matter in the slightest because the beach is directly across the street and is such a short walk. The service, rooms and vibe of this property more than make up for that. The staff is extremely well trained in hospitality and every single one I encountered were exceptionally pleasant and accommodating. I believe this property is proof that this type of professional hospitality staff trained at the highest of levels actually exists. The one small critique I have of the property is that the pool is small and smaller than I would have expected for the size of the hotel.

We ended up staying here somewhat accidentally at the last minute due to flight changes, but I would definitely stay here again if I return to Honolulu. Our reception agent was incredibly helpful and accommodating and readily dealt with our sudden arrival, and also allowed us a late departure.","Date of stay: April 2015","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The rooms are beautifully appointed with free water, coffee, the refrigerators perfect with amazing ice makers. The kitchen is appointed with every pot and pan and dish plus microwave, toaster etc. My daughter wanted to play WII and board games which Trump provided for our stay. The pool was immaculate and breakfast buffet absolutely perfect. This is not an inexpensive hotel but it truly felt so because it was by far the best value I have seen in Hawaii in years. For many years we stayed at a Five Star property on Oahu and the service of Trump International surpassed it by miles. 

Thank you to all at Trump International starting from the top Mr. Trump and all for truly making us feel like family and providing us with a place to regroup and vacation without a care.

From the moment you get out of your ride to the hotel until the moment you leave, you feel taken care of. They have thought out every little detail.  All the way from providing you with a beach bag, towels, fresh fruit and even sun block.  The service is impeccable.  The rooms are kept very clean and the amenities are excellent.  The kitchen is fully loaded with everything you can possibly need during your stay. This hotel is truly made for frequent travelers who appreciate being pampered. The personalized attention the concierge provided was out of this world.  They took care of reservations to restaurants in the area, found a specific car we wanted o rent, arranged a tour and was very knowledgable about the details on visiting Pearl Harbor, how to get tickets and when to visit the site. Spending time at this hotel made me feel I had spent my money at the right place.  It was an incredible trip for my kids on their first visit to Hawaii and definitely  one that they will never forget. Being steps form the beach was exactly the thing we needed. This place was perfect to start our Hawaii trip. I can not say the same about our stay on the next island.  But that is another story.

I loved that!  Our room was nice, the view was amazing.  The bathroom was a completely different story - first off I am 5'9"" so pretty tall.  To get in and out of the shower/tub I had to stretch my legs to get over the side and into the shower.  I have bruises still from hitting it a bunch of times.  The second terrible thing about the shower is that there is only a half wall covering it, no curtain or door so the floor was soaked each time we showered.  Third we didn't care for the lack of a bathing suit line or extra rack to dry them on or to place the towels.  I didn't need my towels exchanged daily but had no place to put them so they were taken daily.  

The pool is very small which is fine because the ocean is right there.  However the chairs are filled up quickly so get there early.  Also, I sat at the pool one day for over 2 1/2 hours and was not offered a drink - not even once.  That to me is not the service you would expect from a 5 star hotel.

We went to breakfast once at the hotel and it was horrible.  I ordered pancakes not once, not twice but three times before I had to ask a manager to please bring them to me.  It took well over 25 minutes for buffet pancakes.  When we went to pay we did not want to charge to the room but to use our CC.  I handed it to the waiter and he brought it back telling me it was declined.  My husband used his and the same thing - waiter said it was declined with some odd code.  I called my bank while at the table and they did not see a charge attempt being made.  I asked the waiter to try again while I was on the phone and the bank still couldn't see a charge attempt and he told us it was not going through.  We charged to our room and went on our way to figure out why the bank couldnt see the charges.  

Later we tried to use my husbands card at another location and it wouldn't go through.  We called the bank and apparently the waiter was hand pressing the numbers and kept entering an incorrect exp date or 3 digit code so he locked the card and it was marked stolen.  We were able to get that resolved.  

That night we were awoken by a fire alarm at 0330.  We walked down the stairs only to be told we could immediately enter the building.  We noticed an elevator had water pouring down, so I am not sure if a fire was put out or not.  It would have been nice to receive a note telling us that it was a false alarm or indeed a fire and that the hotel managed it appropriately.  Something explaining why I was running down 12 flights of stairs at 3 am in a robe would have been nice. 

Lastly, the staff at the front desk were very helpful.  They extended my checkout until my flight - which was very late.  I appreciate that - it was a very nice feature of your resort.","Date of stay: March 2015","Trip type: Traveled on business","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

I simply loved this hotel and was a little afraid that it would not be as good the second time round. Wrong!! It was marvellous in every way. The welcome and check in was friendly and efficient. As I was being escorted to my ""Deluxe Studio Ocean view "" room I asked about an upgrade to a ""Superior Studio"" if I was not completely satisfied. I had booked my accommodation through Hawaii Five -O and not with the hotel so this may not have been an easy upgrade to make. It was not necessary. My room (8th Floor) was great!! Huge bathroom, fluffy robes,superior products and linen. Comfortable bed and pillows, more than adequate kitchenette with modern appliances. An iron (that was clean and actually worked) and ironing board tucked away proved helpful and the lounge area was spacious, spotless and comfortable. This Hotel is truly 5 star. Everyone is smiling and happy to assist. The pool is a perfect place to relax and escape the crowds that can be at the beach opposite. However, if the beach is more your thing then  you are sent off with a tote bag, towel, water etc compliments of the Hotel.
You are not pestered in any way yet staff are there for anything you may need to make your stay more enjoyable. The bars and restaurants are amazing. I have celebrated my birthday 2 years running now in BLT on the ground floor, (a little on the expensive side but well worth it)
From check in to check out, from the view from your private lanai to the steaming hot, strong shower, decadent linen and pampering, this Hotel,, in the heart of Waikiki is worth every cent you will pay.","Date of stay: March 2015","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Service Can Be Better and More Considerate in Some Areas.","This is a very decent hotel with an excellent location and proximity to shopping, the beach, restaurants, etc. Excellent ocean view rooms yet you still hear the traffic. The service can be better. For example, we started with 3 kitchen towels but what used were never replaced. Also, the cream and sugar provided in the room are for one time use only - again not replenished. Was told that used dishes and tableware can be placed in the sink and housekeeping would take care of them. They were placed back into the drawer and cabinets but they were not cleaned. My lipstick was still on the coffee mugs. I forgot to load the egg into the pot with cold water and placed them into the boiling water so one egg cracked as soon as it hit the hot water. That egg white marking in the pot was still there when I tried to used the same pot again to make hard boiled egg the next day. The phone on the desk and other furniture were covered with dust. With such bright sun you can't avoid seeing the dust all over the place. The sink stopper was also disgusting. There isn't any shelving for toiletry such as body wash and shampoo inside the shower stall. You have to leave them on the floor but at the end all the bottles were filled with water. One would think it's very basic need for a hotel shower stall. First time ever I have been to a hotel I don't know where to place the body wash and shampoo, not to even mention about being ergonomic. Guess the idea is to exercise your back and knees while you shower! I would expect a hotel in this category to have hand-held shower but it's definitely not very friendly for any pug size guests. 

This is a hotel for kids. Both in-room and at its restaurants kids are provided with activity books with lots of stickers. A stepping stool, kids size bathrobe and  slipper were provided in the ensuite bathroom making the kids feel so special and spoiled. 

During our stay there was a fire alarm malfunction, all guests were evacuated at 3:30 am. When you close your bedroom door to sleep one could hardly hear the speaker in the hallway off the room door. When the guests were rushing down the metal staircase, the announcement/broadcast from the hotel cannot be heard over the echoing metal noise.  There was an apology letter sent to every room the next day by housekeeping but I thought the hotel could have done a little more than just that! After all, guests from a few months old to in the 80s were all woken up for the hotel's own mistakes.","Date of stay: March 2015","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

There were 6 of us, 4 adults and 2 boys, 2 and 4. From the minute we arrived we were made to feel welcome and very comfortable, it was almost as if we were royalty.

We had a booked a 2 bedroom and a Den suite however when we arrived we were informed that we had been upgraded to a Premium3 bedroom Ocean front Suite which was amazing .  It was so spacious and well equipped and the view was to die for. It was really hard to leave the room as it was so comfortable the suites are exactly the same as they are pictured on the website.

When we arrived we were directed to sit in the Wai’olu Ocean View Lounge where we were given cold towels to freshen up with, followed by a drink of watermelon infused water which was really refreshing. When the paper work was in order we were shown to our room where there was a box of Honolulu Cookies waiting for us, soft toys with Trump Kids embroidered on them for the kids as well as Trump colouring in books and pencils which was a nice touch. There were even kid’s robes and slippers for the boys.
The pool was great not huge but adequate and very nice to swim in. The pool area was very well equipped with ice drinking water, towels, towels for the lounges, plenty of lounges; sunscreen and even baby swim nappies. There were plenty of staff around the pool for bar and food service and to clean up as soon as someone left the pool area.
The staff very so friendly and accommodating from the bell boys to the housekeepers they were all great. What I thought was great, was that once the staff heard our boys names they called them by name all the time. Whenever we went through the foyer we were asked did we require anything like water or beach bags or even umbrellas if the weather was a bit unsure.
The beach bags were a nice touch as well, stocked with towels, water, sunscreen and fruit very handy when heading to the beach.

The Maitais were excellent actually everything was excellent.

Our reservation was handled by Genevieve Lemire-Dunbar who was a pleasure to deal with from start to finish.

We had the journey from hell to get to Hawaii from Vermont and due to weather related flight delays, arrived 24 hours late. Genevieve was very accommodating and we are very grateful that she happily changed the dates of our reservation due to the circumstances. It was this flexibility and helpful attitude that really made the difference. 

The room and facilities were great. 

The Hotel is also surprisingly good value. Being able to cook some meals in ones room rather than being forced to eat out every time, soon saves a lot of money. Also one does not get nickled and dimed with 'resort fees', 'mandatory gratuities' and 'internet charges' as one does at so many of their competitors. Again unlike their competitors they were totally upfront about the parking charge. These add-ons are a pet peeve of mine and it was a pleasure to have no surprises at check out.  They were totally straightforward and one felt that what one is quoted is what one pays.

I am such a princess when it comes to accomodation as I am very fussy about cleanliness, and I was very happy at Trump. We had a suite with den so lots of space, and we were able to cook meals and bring drinks back to put in the fridge.

The staff were just amazing, and so helpful, reliable and friendly.

We loved the beach bags that you grab from the lobby on the way out with water, sunscreen fruit etc. The pool area is small, but lovely. We didnt love the food choice, except breakfast, which was great to get delivered to our room.

When we were there, our child woke in the middle of the night in agony and was taken to emergency, and the staff were so helpful and even came to visit the next day with a little get well juice.... she felt very special after that.

The location was away from the hustle and bustle, but close enough to be able to walk every where, and you can get the trolley from out the front.

There are plenty of ABC shops nearby which were great for any little things you needed from the shop....

I cannot put into words how much I loved this holiday. I generally dont like being away from home, but after 10 days I didnt want to leave and I will be going back one day... hopefully in the next couple of years.....

While the hotel is not directly on the beach, it is a short walk through a beautiful park and so location is not a big deal. The hotel provides a beach bag with all the little amenities that make for a great day, which is a very nice touch.

The lobby is incredible, overlooking a beautiful park with the city skyline as the backdrop. The staff are all incredibly helpful and friendly, from the valet to the porters and the reservations desk.

The location of the Trump is fantastic, affording nearby access to the central shopping district, some really great restaurants like Nobu, and of course, the beach.

The infinity pool is incredible and I've spent many evenings watching the sunset from there. Their drinks are well made and in the mornings the breakfast is quite delicious.

The rooms are great, well appointed, and the balcony views are lovely. They are a little on the small side for the category, though.

I used few services as I have my routine and generally dine at Roys which is right around the corner.  In future I'll be torn. For nonbusiness I'll likely stay with Halekulani. For business ... will definitely consider Trump. One of my hold backs on Trump is the overt Trumpness with the Trump channel, etc. The best way to distinguish halekulani and trump is to use a phrase Momma used ... ""new money."" I believe old money will prefer the halekulani.","Date of stay: February 2015","Trip type: Traveled on business","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

This was our first trip to Hawaii and staying at this location made our vacation much more enjoyable. Everything we needed was within walking distance. Beaches, restaurants, shops and parks were easily accessible. Bus stops were just across the street as well. We used the public transportation for our visit to the USS Arizona Memorial. 

Everything about our stay at the Trump really exceeded all our expectations. The customer service was par excellence! The front desk was readily available to answer all our questions and requests. Never a frown and always ready to please. Very well dressed personnel - everyone!

Our room was ready when we arrived - no waiting at all. Nice, clean and fresh...just the way to make our long trip all the worthwhile. The bed was very comfortable as were all the chairs, etc. We were situated on the 23rd. floor with an ocean view. I must say that it's not completely an ocean view as there were several other hotels nearby. This blocked off a complete view. I'll post some pics. Nothing negative, just an observation. I wouldn't hesitate to book similar rooms in the near future. 

All said and done, for us, everything was picture perfect for our stay at the Trump.","Date of stay: February 2015","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The remarkable high quality of service at this establishment, was apparent right away as we were greeted with beautiful leis, and the luggage was taken care of without having to even ask about it. We were given an upgrade to a deluxe partial ocean view room which came with its own private lanai. The bed was supposed to be king size with a queen sleeper sofa. Frankly, the king bed seemed more like a queen to me, and I mentioned the same to the front desk after a day. They spoke to housekeeping, and lo and behold, the housekeeping manager actually replaced the entire mattress for me!! He and his staff also made sure to stop by and inquire if the new bedding was to our satisfaction, all of this with smiles, we were truly blown away with this level of service! In fact, I noted all the staff here would always greet guests with alohas, give up elevators to guests, meet all requests promptly and politely; even the bellmen remembered simple things like us having taken a taxi to a restaurant earlier in the evening asking us how the dinner was later that night...in short, everyone tried to go above and beyond as much as possible. Oh, did I mention the Hawaiian cookies and popcorn in our room upon arrival and special fruit plate for my son on his birthday?

As far as the room itself, everything (apart from the bed as mentioned above) was simply perfect. The room size was quite large with two small closets, so we could essentially keep our beach/outdoor things separate which I like to do. The kitchenette was well equipped with everything even for a fair amount of cooking, though I did not really cook there. Having a fridge, microwave, toaster, stove-top etc does help though, to at least heat up and eat left overs from restaurant dinners and/or make simple breakfast, since dining in Hawaii can get pretty expensive. There is an ABC store at walking distance to bring in grocery items, or you can have the attache service do it for you. I loved the coffee-maker, it was actually brewing hot coffee, versus other ones in hotels that barely eke out luke warm concoctions. Coming to the bathroom, there was a sumptuous tub for long baths that my son enjoyed, a separate shower, double sink and all Trump products. The bathrobes in the room were absolutely amazing, so cozy, I could live in them, wish I could have brought one home! Sitting on the lanai, looking out to the ocean was priceless.

Before booking, I had doubts about property not being on the beach, but it really is a very short walk, so I am extremely glad I went for this rather than Hilton Village or Outrigger, which were my other choices. The beach bags that they provide were great, and you can easily rent chairs on the beach. Pool at the hotel is small, they do have chairs around it and at another level below and you can get partial ocean views from there. There is free wi-fi in the rooms, a library with 3 computers, gym and spa are at same level as the library. 
Wai-'olu their lounge, serves an award winning mai-tai, it was really really good, so was the non-alcoholic cocktail my son had. The tapas style food there though is quite over-priced for the serving size. In-'yo cafe for breakfast, great spread of food and beverages, but again high price. 

Lastly, our flight out of HNL was delayed, so we had to switch it to an entirely different one, they allowed us an extended stay in our room for few hours after which due to another guest arriving there we were moved to their hospitality room which was a city view studio I think all at no extra charge which was wonderful since we got to enjoy the few extra hours on Waikiki beach and come back to the hotel for a shower and meal before heading back to the airport. 

Easily one of the best vacations we have had, and we will be certainly staying at Trump facilities in the future. Ranks up there for me, vying for #1 spot with the Taj Exotica Goa...you have totally converted my son Mr. Trump...now if your food equalled that at the Taj, you would completely convert me too!!","Date of stay: February 2015","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I didn't know what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised from the moment our taxi pulled up into the driveway, and was devastated when we had to leave. The service at the Trump Waikiki was prompt, unique and delivered with importance by the excellent staff working here. When we checked in we were given a complimentary upgrade to our room, which included a bigger room altogether and a larger balcony. The room was the one that the hotel sells as their Studio Apartments for those who want to buy. The room was big, included a pull out couch, a bathtub and shower, a microwave, gas range, moderately sized safe, coffee maker with complimentary Kona coffee mini fridge with a freezer section and a wide variety of kitchen utensils (some of which I don't have in my own home) including plates, bowls, silver cutlery and glasses. Water bottles were complimentary as well throughout our stay. We were able to get a partial ocean view on the 20th floor in room 2016, which was outstanding. All of the staff, whether they were the maids, maintenance, concierge, waiter, etc. always greeted us no matter where they saw us on the hotel property and asked us how our day was. They were truly nice and were definitely concerned for our well being and comfort. The elevator had a scanning system in which you had to scan your card first before choosing a floor and you could only select the floor you were staying at to maintain privacy for the guests. The hotel was less than a quarter mile walk from the main area of Waikiki beach (it was literally across the street), and was also across the street from a Starbucks, small convenient store and an awesome gelato place. The shops surrounding the hotel are very upscale (Coach, Louis Vuitton, Prada, etc.) and there is also a mall nearby with many shops and restaurants as well as a two story food court. Also the bathtub in the room was huge!

On the second day, my mom was suspicious that they had given us a queen bed instead of a king sized bed. I expected the hotel to say there was nothing they could do about it, and it was in fact a kind bed. I was the wrongest I have ever been and completely blown away when the bought a brand new California king bed exclusively for us (it still had the tag on it), and installed it in the room at no extra charge and without complaint the next day. Words fail to describe how amazed I was.

The concierge desk gave us a beach bag for free every time we asked for one that included water bottles, towels, and fruit (the oranges were especially sweet). 

On my birthday we ate at their restaurant and lounge, Wai'olu, which was just as outstanding as the rest of the hotel. The drinks (I ordered nonalcoholic) were distinct to the hotel and were, needless to say, really good. The food was amazing, but the only issue I had was that the serving sizes were too small for the prices they charged , ranging anywhere from $14 for a plate of plantain chips (which were fortunately worth the price) to $32 for meat heavy dishes. Other than this, the service combined with the unique, tropical taste of the food lead to a wonderful experience. For my birthday and because we were a part of the Trump Attache service, they gave us a fruit plate and a few Hawaiian drinks and snacks. 

We had the hotel breakfast buffet at their In-Yo Cafe twice at our stay. The $33 fee was definitely worth it. There was a large variety of food, and a lot of it was Japanese. This did not bother me as they had and omelette station, cereal, french toast, waffles, and a bakery section out of which the chocolate croissant was my favorite along with the ""doughnut on a stick"". They also had a wide selection of danishes and muffins, as well as scrambled eggs, potatoes, bacon, and other items that you would expect to find at any continental buffet, the exception was that at the Trump the food was phenomenal. They also had many juices such as pineapple, guava, orange and tomato. 

At one point I wanted to take a bath and I couldn't find any bath products in the bathroom, which my mom thought was odd since they had such a wide variety of beauty/spa and personal hygiene products such as a facial bar, body bar, mouthwash, bathrobes, slippers, dental kit, etc. We went to the spa to maybe buy a bath product as we did not want to complain because of how amazing our stay had been so far. At the spa we discovered that housekeeping had forgotten to give us complimentary bath salts, which they were very apologetic about and sent up immediately. They smelled just as unique and upscale as the rest of the bath and beauty products (all of which were Trump branded and had an exclusive smell). 

I ordered room service twice from the trump, and both times it was just as amazing as the rest of the food there. Their fries were truly crispy, and the food was delivered promptly and was brought to our room covered with brand new sealed, personal glass bottles of ketchup. They were more than happy to give us a glass with ice to put our own drinks from the local ABC store (convenient store) in and when they forgot something they apologized, bringing back what we wanted in less than two minutes every time (it only happened twice). 

Overall, the service from all the employees was outstanding. Housekeeping always accommodated our desires as to when they should service our room. The valet service people held our doors when we got in a cab, and always asked how our dinner was when we went out to eat (even when I didn't remember myself that we had gone to dinner)

All in all I strongly recommend the Trump Waikiki. There is so much more I can say about this hotel, but I don't want this review to be too long (I'm pretty sure it already is). The staff is helpful, and caring, and the food and rooms are amazing. Hawaii is a very exotic, exceptional, culturally focused and upscale place. You should match these qualities with a hotel that compliments and harmonizes with the beauty that is Hawaii. There is no hotel that does this job better than the Trump Waikiki. You will not regret staying here.","Date of stay: February 2015","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

There were many things that made this hotel special, for instance we received beautiful leis when we checked in.  We also received a delicious box of cookies and a box of chocolates too.  The soaps and shampoos were plentiful and high quality.  The room was upgraded to an ocean view studio (thanks to American Express Platinum) and it was a good sized, well appointed room.  The buffet breakfast was better than adequate but not the type of breakfast that one should expect at a 5-star facility.  The staff was super-nice and very helpful and we enjoyed our stay.  So why does the Trump Int'l not receive a top review?  The shower in the bathroom was accessible only by climbing into a high tub ... the breakfast was buffet only ... the carpet could use an upgrade .. the linens were good, not great ... the free wifi was very slow.

We had a deluxe studio ocean view.  We were in Room 1605.
This overlooked Fort Derussey Park, the Hilton Hawaiian Village and the ocean.  Although you are across from a park the road that runs around the park and across the front of the hotel (directly below your balcony) is a busy one with several bus lines and the trolley.  So there is a fair bit of road noise coming from that.  The door opening onto the lanai is quite heavy, so they've tried to soundproof the room as best they can.  The lanai is a decent size with two chairs and a small table.  If you are eating in at all, this will be your dining table as otherwise there's just the coffee table in front of the sofa.
The galley kitchen is well stocked.  They have plates, cups, glasses, wine glasses, pots and pans, serving bowls, platters, you name it.  Lots of cooking utensils and silverware.  There is also a tea kettle, a toaster, a rice cooker (I think that's what it was), and a coffee maker. They provide paper towels, and some soap and dish towels if you choose to do your dishes.  I did the one night when we reheated our restaurant leftovers, but the breakfast bowls and wine glasses that I left in the sink were always all washed up and put away when we came back to the room.  The fridge is a decent size, but beware.  The bottom gets very cold.  I put a beer bottle down there, and it froze.  Didn't realize it would do that since it wasn't a separate compartment. There's a microwave and stove top.  Didn't use the stove top, and the microwave didn't work, but when I reported it, they were up in a flash and provided us a counter-top replacement. 
The bathroom is HUGE with a tub.  There was always lots of hot water and the hotel bathroom amenities were top notch.  They provide lots of towels and two bathrobes and sets of slippers.  There was also a shower cap, sewing kit, toothbrush as well as the usual ""stuff"".  The bed was a dream, lovely sheets and pillows.  I did find the duvet made me quite warm, so bring light sleepwear.
There were plenty of plugs to plug in electronics, and there was a radio that you could put your ipod into and an in-room safe.  The couches and chair were comfortable, and the flat screen tv was decent.  There is one closet and one set of drawers to put your things in. 
The staff were all very nice to deal with and always had smiles for you.  We used the valet parking which was a bit expensive but very convenient.  Whenever we called for our car, it was always there within 5 minutes of us calling.  The beach bag with towels, water and fruit was absolutely the best.
Some have complained that the hotel isn't right on the beach, but you can literally walk out the door and be at the beach in under one minute.  We didn't use the spa, gym or eat at the restaurants, so I can't comment on those.  We did go to the pool, and the pool staff was very efficient.  The pool itself is small, and it has a hot tub, but it was sufficient for our needs.  There were always chairs, and it wasn't always hot enough to go in the pool, so the pool area wasn't very crowded.  It can get a bit windy on the pool deck, but down the stairs there is a more wind shielded area with chairs that you can sit at.
All in all, this is a very nice place to stay.  It has a new, clean feel to it, which is something in Waikiki.  This is why I chose to stay here even though it was on the pricier side.","Date of stay: January 2015","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

The Trump is in a fabulous location in Wakiki with easy access to the bars and restaurants on the strip.

We had a beautiful 1 bedroom apartment on the 21st floor with ocean views. The bathroom and bed were huge and the kitchen had all we needed and more.

Also, I filled the form that Attaché emailed me. They have you fill a questionnaire in order to make sure you have s comfortable stay such as room temp, any extra items in the kitchen, and so on. We requested to have a coffee press. When we got to our room, it was nowhere to be found. We had to call for that as well. Why bother filling out the form if you have to ask for it anyways. I really appreciate them trying to recover from that by giving us chocolates, cookies, and a certificate for free sparkling wine at the bar. 

The bed is a little hard for what we prefer. The kitchen was great to use! I loved all the high end appliances.

We really wanted to enjoy our stay but that rough start put a damper on it all. Afterwards, we extended our celebration at the Kahala Resort to end things right!","Date of stay: January 2015","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

I wanted to stay on the beach and after a recommendation from a friend I booked an ocean suite at the Outrigger Waikiki Beach Resort. 
Just before Christmas I realised  there was a big rate increase at the Outrigger on my 3rd night and at the same time there was a good special at the Trump. After reading all the reviews I decided to book 4 nights to see if the hype was true!
Unfortunately my son was rushed to hospital on our second night in Waikiki with a burst appendix.
The next day I quickly moved our luggage to the Trump and went on to hospital.
My husband and I returned to the Trump that evening tired and exhausted after a long day with our son.
On checking in we were given an upgrade to a 1 bed Suite with 2 bathrooms on 31 floor! It was fabulous, a massive suite with ocean views and 2 balconies.the kitchen was better equipped than my kitchen at home!  We then received a call from Jeff on the front desk. They had heard about our son and offered us a complementary meal from room service and any further assistance. It was just the tonic we needed after a long day.
The next couple of days were spent at the hospital but each evening we were offered assistance to make our stay easier. 
I loved this hotel, all the staff were fantastic. A special mention must go to Dean and his staff on the bell Desk. Dean was so friendly, an amazing guy. Nothing was too much trouble and he bent over backwards to give us great service and tips on our days out.
We decided to extend our stay for another 4 days once my son was out of hospital.
The pool is small, but I loved the whole area. Great view of the ocean and sunsets, it was very relaxing. As mentioned previously, the beach bags are a nice touch too.
The location is great, lots of restaurants and shopping within a few minutes and I thought  the area was much nicer than the full on bustle at the outrigger.

Now I expect you may think that this review is fake as I really could not fault the Trump. I had read the forum many times before my trip and some comments seemed to be a bit negative towards the hotel suggesting it had no Hawaiian feel and it was too corporate. Well in my opinion if, like me, you like a modern, spacious, well equipped hotel with fantastic service then choose the Trump. It was $200 a night cheaper than the Outrigger and in a totally different league. 

I hope to return again ..... Soon!","Date of stay: January 2015","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

There were two adults, my 16 year-old daughter and my 12 year-old son. The staff were absolutely wonderful, always saying “aloha” and “mahalo”. We had a 1-bedroom suite with a fold-out couch. The bathroom was enormous, which was a bit odd. The room was beautifully cleaned each day and the fold-out made and put away for us.

The location of the hotel was great. There were plenty of restaurants and shops in easy walking distance. The beach near the hotel wasn’t that great, but it was easy enough to head down to the Waikiki beach on the trolley. Trolleys were great and cheap. You just need to make sure you get a lot of $1 notes.

The Sunset Bar at the hotel was beautiful and we saw some great sunsets from there.

The kids enjoyed the stay and gave the free wi-fi a good work out.

The hotel is a little be corporate, so not really a resort style. There are no big open spaces like some of the hotels in the area. But it was immaculately presented.

Worked hard to get the Trump as it was sold out when we originally booked our trip but were able to snatch a premium one bedroom ocean view plus den suite a few weeks before leaving. 

The reason we wanted the Trump is that we like upscale hotels that offer suites large enough to accommodate our family of 4, and we always try and stay in newer properties. And there aren't a lot of those in Waikiki.

We were quite pleased with the resort. Though it seems to be a more common occurence in Hawaii than elsewhere, I do need to say that the staff was extremely efficient and friendly. Concierge, front desk, maintenance, everyone was just so darn friendly! And management had a few gifts for us. Not sure if it was only for the holidays but we got lollipop cakes at check in and cookies on New Year's eve as well celebratory gear (hats, etc.). Nice touch.

The room was very large, extremely clean and well equipped with premium kitchen appliances, 3 TVs, marble bathrooms, etc. We especially appreciated having a den (which was more of an extension of the living room and fully open) because it gave each of our 2 kids a separate sofa bed and TV. And even though the Trump is not directly on the beach, it is a block away and views are nice. 

Speaking of location, the Trump is really only steps away from all the action. Beyond the very close beach, we liked being steps away from all the restaurants and upscale shops. Gives you lots to do within walking distance. Want some fun in the sun? No problem. The beach is 5 minutes away. Had too much sun? No problem. You can walk to shops and activities. 

And to close off on the positives, the pool area is really nice. Though it seems small at first, it was never really crowded, even as the hotel was sold out for the holidays. And the view in that infinity pool that overlooks Fort De Russy and the beach, WOW!

Now, there has to be things that weren't so great... 

1) Our room was right by a service elevator. While we really only heard it while in the master bath, I continue to be puzzled there isn't a way to avoid that. Would it be that big of a deal or cost to build some buffer between a $1400/night room and an elevator? And for the record, we did ask to change rooms and were offered an alternative but chose to forego as it was (or felt) smaller and on a lower floor. Not a deal breaker. We slept fine. Just a tiny annoyance.

2) Hot water was scarce and we had to take a few lukewarm showers. We even got a letter from management explaining it had to do with the cooler weather and full hotel and asking us to try and not use too much hot water. Again, a small annoyance, but really? This is a luxury, $1400/night hotel. Hot water in my mind is kind of basic. I can live with it happening once but this continued for the last two days.

3) Sofa beds mattresses were not the most comfy. While they never really are but in these, you really felt the springs. 

That being said, these were small annoyances. This was our first stay in a Trump and it will not be the last, whether in Waikiki or elsewhere. We loved it. We will return!","Date of stay: December 2014","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

It is still the best hotel to stay in Waikiki.  Since I am a return visitor, they upgraded me to the premium 3 bedroom suite.  My room unit 3310 had a spectacular Southeast view over the pacific ocean and Diamond head.  We were celebrating my mom's 77th birthday and the room just made the occasion so much more special.  We know our way around Honolulu fairly well, so didn't need that much help from the staff, but their valet, housekeeping and the concierge staff are very well trained.  

I was very satisfied with our suite, but I could see a little wear and tear on kitchen furnishings: pots and pans need replacement, and the kitchen faucet was a little wobbly.  Nothing the management cannot fix if it were brought to their attention.  At departure, I was going to refresh right after we were all loaded, and couple of staff laid suitcases of a tour group along the corridor and refused to let me in the restroom.  They were the least apologetic and instructed to let me go to the restroom 8 floors up.  Really?!  My otherwise satisfactory experience was tainted at the end, but when I brought it to the management's attention, they were very apologetic.","Date of stay: January 2015","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

My stay here for 3 nights was no exception; in fact, it is the reason why I have returned each year for the 3rd time in succession. It is evident that no request is too small or inconvenient. Staff and management across all departments excel at anticipating your needs, which is a key ingredient to making a hotel stay memorable.

I would like to ask management what has happened to the presentation of their award winning Mai Tai. The uploaded picture shows how the drink was presented back in Oct 2013. During our recent January stay, the drink was presented in a plastic cup without garnish or flare (sorry I can’t provide a picture). This is by no means a complaint but am interested to find out why considering that my wife and I delicately sip (…or more likely guzzle) them poolside (and I’m not joking about the tag for the drink – it has won awards it is that good!).

Again Trump Waikiki, thank you for making another vacation to Hawaii memorable. If you are prepared to pay extra for this hotel, it’s one of the best on the Island.","Date of stay: January 2015","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

When I Waikiki, I will not stay at any hotel but the Trump. There - I said it! I have stayed at 3 other hotels in Waikiki but have never been back since my first stay at the Trump.

Firstly, flights from Australia often arrive early in the morning well before the stated check in time. We arrived at the hotel at approx 8am and were in an upgraded room with beautiful views by 10am overlooking the ocean!

I had advised the staff that I had recently been engaged and in my room on our arrival was a congratulatory piece of cake and bottle of champagne! In addition, a seperate note and cake was delivered for my birthday which was a few weeks earlier - completely unexpected and a lovely touch.

The team at Trump were helpful at every turn, even taking delivery of my wedding dress and delivering to my room. I simply cannot fault the Trump, their beautiful rooms, calm poolside and INCREDIBLE service.

As soon as we arrived, we were greeted by friendly staff with necklaces. Due to our flight arriving at 6am in the morning, we were not able to check in straight away, but the staff had arranged for storage of our belongings and gave us a ring when the room was ready at 1045am. 

The room was well sized, clean, well equipped kitchen with miniature oven/microwave, and complimentary waters everyday. The bathroom was huge with his and hers vanity area. The bath itself was quite large in size. 

Location is fantastic, close to the beach, a block away from the luxury shopping areas, not far to Ala Moana for more shopping. 

We had breakfast buffet which had good selection of food and a lovely barista made coffee, which are hard to come by in America. 

Their infinity pool is rather small for the size of the hotel, but when the beach is so close by, the use of pool is rather unnecessary. 

Rental of umbrella was an ease, we didn't have to give them our room numbers. They have enough faith in the customers so that who ever needs one takes one, and returns at their own leisure, which is easy. 

They had an express check out service which made checking out convenient, as we had to leave to the big island at 5am in the morning.

Only one block from the beach, the location is central, with easy walking distance to the shopping centres and buses. The only bad aspect is the narrow small swimming pool and spa. The pool is not ideal for children who would like to spend hours in the pool, and I wonder if the pool size was a deliberate choice to deter hoards of noisy children  however many adults (like me) love to have a reasonable sized pool to swim in.

While Trump's offer of hardware is not without regrets(eg. not beach front, smallish pool and gym), its customer service is second to none, absolutely top notch around the world. We visit Waikiki yearly, sometimes twice a year, and the Trump has stayed #1 on tripadivsor for 5 years straight. I have no doubt its astonishing success is entirely due to its outstanding and consistent customer service. I only wish all hotels are like this. 

We just got back this morning in fact. We stayed for 7 days over the holidays, in supposedly one of the smaller studios. Upon checkin we were surprised with an upgrade to a fairly sizeable suite(still ""studio""). It's beautifully appointed, double sink bathroom, marble tub, seperate shower area. Very functional kitchen with all the utensils you need. We made breakfast everyday. They have an attache service that allows you to dictate how you like your room daily -how many towels, room temperature, amongst many many things you can detail. There is no need to repeat a request, it's done the first time you asked for it. Staff is exceedingly friendly - and not just friendly but genuine. 

One of the reasons we love the Trump is because we travel with our dog - their pet program is fantastic. The manager ran into us in the lobby and he even showed us a picture of his puppy. He told us he's reviewed history of my dog's stay at the Trump. At first I was skeptical but he called out my dog's name without hesitation! The amount of attention to detail is baffling. A staff member also gave us tips on where to take my dog for NYE fireworks so my dog is not frightened by the noise. The overall experience is beyond exceptional. I would loathe staying at one of those multi-towered hotels where you become just another guest. 

I can go on and on about how great this hotel is and I am sure I won't be the last. If you want great service and an an exceptional stay at Waikiki, Trump Waikiki is undoubtedly your best choice. Yes they are not an inexpensive hotel, but it's worth every cent. The pool - it's small but we have found it to be very comfortable and relaxing. It's heated and has a hot whirl pool on the side too. I often wondered why they couldn't make the pool and gym areas bigger. Yes the gym is sadly quite crammed(they really should extend it to another room). But who goes to the gym while in Hawaii right? :)

It is a great hotel - book early for busy seasons. We booked 6M ahead so we can have a selection of room types to fit our budget. 

I made a small complaint about the pool being under staffed - and I was almost sorry I did because the overwhelming recourse made me feel so bad I made them feel bad. Next day - boom, we saw an additional pool staff standing by, along with a personal call from management to assure their service standard. Just like that. They take their guests seriously. Their consistent insistence on guest experience is outstanding.

We were six adults and four kids in three deluxe studio rooms. Kids were 2.5, 5, 7, and 10. Arrival and check-in went smoothly - what you would expect from a high-end property. Lei greeting upon arrival, luggage promptly taken care of, cold towels and drinks, etc. Also, we were celebrating one adult and two children's birthdays during out stay - welcomed by a gorgeous and very tasty chocolate cake in our room. We also received treats for the kids, and pineapple-shaped cookies - I don't think this was birthday-specific.

Room was spacious and met our needs. We didn't need a full kitchen for our three-night stay, but could see how useful it could be for longer stays (note: fridge is not full-size, but there's a cooktop, microwave, pots/pans, dishes, glasses, etc. Bathroom spacious too though our second sink was right where the door opens into so it practically made it a not useable (probably won't be the case if you have less people staying in the room whereas we were two adults and two kids). Enjoyed time on the balcony with a view of the ocean. WiFi worked well.

Gorgeous views of the ocean from the lobby lounge, partial ocean views from the pool. We found the pool just right for our needs. Many lounge chairs, many chairs in the sun and many in the shade. No it's not a resort-style pool. but I would not consider this a resort hotel so not a problem for me. This upscale, centrally-located hotel is a very short walk to the beach. Loved that the hotel provides beach bags with towels, bottled water, fruit and sunscreen. We took beach bags to Waikiki Beach and also on a trip to Hanauma Bay. Super handy!

FYI - Valet parking is the only parking option. It was efficient and we never waited long for our car. We went in and out a lot! Valet made sure AC was running and that we were always well-stocked with bottled water in the car.

Wish we could've stayed longer, but we were greedy and also packed in Disney Aulani in the same week! Hope to return in the future.","Date of stay: October 2014","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

It's not a huge hotel so you can't camp out there, but everything was excellent quality with a lot of attention paid to detail. Pool area was nice if petite, somehow there weren't swarms of kids so it was relaxing, and the only tiny disappointment was that it sat a row behind the beachfront hotels so not a full but a partial view of the sea.

The hotel is new and beautiful, certainly unlike others on Waikiki, the rooms are nice - very much like a beautiful custom apartment. And as others have written, the service is second to none, living up to the name.

My issue with hotel was certainly not the service (again amazing). It was the location. Understand that the hotel is not on the beach. Its a block inland and you have to walk to a very crowded spot in Waikiki.  If you want to get chairs on the beach, its $50 a day to rent from the locals. For what you are paying for the room, I think amenities such as this should be included. In addition, while there is a pool at the hotel, its on the 6th floor, its small, and faces a building (partial ocean view). Other hotels, while older and nowhere near as nice, are at least on the beach. 

If you love having a gorgeous condo and amazing service, but don't mind walking back and forth to the public beach, this is for you!","Date of stay: December 2014","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

The espresso is good at the hotel (not easy in Honolulu!). I will confirm everybody's comment about the kind, responsive and always caring staff. If you like meat, go to the steak house that is perfect. When you need a tip for going around (shops, restaurants) the hotel will know, do reservations for you. My wife felt somewhat sick one evening, a few minutes later she had the relevant medicine, and the day after we found some tea and a message ""get well soon!""...touching, then another call to kindly check if everything was ok, any other need, well this gives an idea of how exceptional they are.

Last year we were completely overwhelmed and blown away by the standard of the hotel, the warmth of the staff and the attention to detail.  Every interaction with the staff was full of suprises and fantastic customer focus.  As soon as we alighted from our transport we were greeted by a charming young lady wearing a beautiful, flattering torquise dress who handed us each a lei and looked into our eyes to say “Welcome” with a warm smile.  She got down on one knee to be on the same level as our toddler children and they were thrilled to have this gorgeous adult having a little joke with them.  Move on then to the reception staff who swifly processed our check in with an upgrade.  Another lady came around with glasses of cool water and little packets of Hawaiian Pineapple shaped biscuits for the kids.  Then onto our magnificent room where more treats awaited.  

What changed this year?  The hotel felt like the staff did not have same high morale as last time around, and the service was at times rather sloppy.  We had just arrived buoyant from 3 weeks in paradise and were on our return trip.  The first thing I noticed was the uniforms had changed to a grey, probably very classy but rather somber and I though out of place in this tropical paradise.  The greeting lady was not the same, but then I would have been amazed if that wonderful young woman from last year was still handing out leis.  The reception staff provided a superb upgrade, wonderful.  

We arrived too early for the room so waited in the restaurant located just behind the reception desk.  I was surprised to see 4 staff congregating around the entrance reservation book but no one was working the tables despite there only being 3 parties at the tables.  It took a while to get noticed, a while to get served.  The floor was dirty, and food from a previous party was still strewn on the floor.  The food and drink, when it came, was good, up to the usual good standard of Trump.  Really, the rest of the stay was fine, but the experience at this hotel restaurant dampened my view of the establishment.  Later when we considered dinner, we decided to eat in rather than endure standing on fried chicken legs and chasing restaurant staff again.  

The pool is delightful, warm and fun with little hot tubs, complimentary swim diapers for the little ones, lots of towels.  The wind was howling through the area so no one could stay for long.  The pool could do with a redesign to add wind baffles around the side of the hotel and above the pool to redirect the wind away from the top of the pool.  

There were some highlights though.  The fantastic Ben, who we remembered from last year, left the food in our room and left us a note stating we had not been in when he arrived.  We got back in and dinner was waiting, still covered and warm, excellent.  The lady at the activities desk on the ground floor packed us a nice complimentary beach bag complete with towels, sunscreen, fruit and water so we went and had a swim on Waikiki beach.  

We will stay again.","Date of stay: November 2014","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Stayed in a one bedroom plus den, there was 4 of us and a baby and there was enough space for everyone.  Had ocean view and also over looking for the pool at embassy.  Free Wifi was included as well.  Having two bathrooms was also a big plus and the full kitchen was put to good use.  One of the reasons we stayed at Trump was for the full kitchen because lots of other higher end hotels in Waikiki don't provide that.  We were able to to buy some groceries and make a few breakfasts, lunches and dinners which was good because when you stay for that long, gets tiring eating out all the time. 

 The staff at the Trump was amazing, I never passed an employee without them saying Aloha or asking how everything was.  Location can't be beat, 100 feet to the beach and close to shopping, restaurants, etc.  Used the gym a few times, a little small but when ever I used it I was the only one there so it was fine.  The pool is also small but you are able to relax and enjoy it if you want to and lets get real, you don't come to Hawaii to sit by a pool everyday when the beach is a stone's throw away.

The service, location, room size, and staff is the reason Trump is rated at the top, I would come back for sure to stay here.","Date of stay: December 2014","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The high-level, oceanfront rooms have great views. Good wifi (speed, coverage). But, in price of pricing, this is no '6-star' hotel. It is a Trump, and not a Four Seasons, Mandarin Oriental or Peninsula; it's more a chromed-up Grand Hyatt than a Park Hyatt, more a souped-up Sheraton rather than a St Regis. It is more about over- than understatement. There is a wine storage unit in the apartments, but no welcoming fruits in the room; no chocolate at night; no ceiling shower head; no bedside master light control console. The gym is small and only has basic weight equipment; no sauna or steam room. There is an infinity pool, but it is ridiculously minuscule. There is much fanfare about the spa, but the facilities and menu are extremely basic compared to say, a Banyan Tree spa.

It had a master bedroom with bathroom and massive walk in robe.  It had a full kitchen, dining table, lounge area and a second open area with a sofa bed.  The lounge and the master bedroom had balconies allowing you to view the incredible sunsets.  It is on a busy corner but the traffic noise wasn't bad and ear plugs certainly blocked it out.

Although it is not on the beach it is only literally across the road and about a 2 minute walk.  If you want to go to the beach get a tote bag from the concierge.  It has towels, bottled water and fruit so you don't have to take your own towels and worry about trying to dry them.  They will also offer sunscreen.

There is a trolley stop outside the hotel and one across the road just up a little.  Great for getting the Ala Moana shopping mall and just $2 each way if you don't have a day pass.  The main shopping street is just a block up.

Very genuine and personal service, we felt that great service were provided not because they want your tips but for the brand rather. 10/10 bed great sleeps! Amazing coffee and teas! Housekeeping even do your dishes! just leave them in the sink! 

They even provide free beach bags everyday when you go to the beach, which include beach towel, sunscreen, water and fruits. No deposit needed, just go and grab one on your way out from the ground floor service desk and return it when you come back. Very thoughtful. 

About 2 mins walk to the beach,  5 mins walk to the main shopping street, 7-11 convenience store, lots of good cafes and restaurants around. We like it a lot because it's not as noisy as the hotels right at the centre of Waikiki beach, more privacy here. Lovely infinity pool and spa up at level 6! you get to see sunset there as well.

Last but not least, they do not charge the ridiculous daily resort fees like most of the hotels do there, and you also get free wifi in the room, unlike many other hotels, you will need to pay to use wifi in your room.

It is my favourite hotel. Anywhere. Ever. I can't stay anywhere else now.

Yes it's pricey but this hotel will take your vacation to the next level. The service is unparalleled, the rooms gorgeous and the ocean views are stunning.

Having a full kitchen is such a bonus when you have kids. The lanais are large and very useful. 

Our current room has a perfect view of the HHV fireworks. 

The pool is beautiful, calm and well looked after and not to sound like a snob, the class of people staying at this hotel (compared to the HHV for example) give it a quiet, relaxing resort feel.","Date of stay: December 2014","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Staff were very friendly and attentive.  They even allowed us to extend our check out time as we had an evening flight at no extra charge.

It is the best mix of luxury and space. Studios are 400-500 sq feet which is bigger than equivalent competition and this makes a big difference to comfort and enjoyment when you are staying for a few days. The one bedrooms are even bigger at 700-800 sq feet but pricier.  Our studio was spacious with lanai, divine bed with luxurious linen, two wardrobes, huge marble bathroom and usable kitchenette. The staff left lovely surprises on two occasions of cookies and chocolates to welcome us and thank us for our patronage. In terms of dining we love the Wai'olu ocean view lounge bar, it is a great place for lunch, dinner or a sunset cocktail.  We also like dining at BLT.   Service everywhere is friendly and attentive. 
One point to note is Trump card points are not earned unless you book direct. We booked a Hawaiian Air package on a whim and were not aware of this.

I arrived by foot. However when I returned a few days later via car to check in...WOW!!! I was met by Dean the bell captain and I was personally escorted to the Front Desk by another team member. The room was not quite ready but I was promised it was being expedited and I received a follow up call within 15 minutes to advise it was ready.  I received a complimentary upgrade to a spacious room equipped with a mini fridge, stovetop, microwave. The room was immaculately cleaned. The pillows are heavenly. The housekeeping staff are so sweet and caring. When i declined turndown, the staff were so eager to ensure I was comfortable asking if I even needed more water. The mere reason I didn't rate this property as excellent is simply that the furnishings in the room do not exude luxury.
HIGHLIGHT OF MY STAY....
Dean was simply outstanding. He was attentive and recalled and used my name every time he saw me. He is constantly surveying the drive and the entry to ensure anyone approaching is greeted and offered assistance. He is proactively moving swiftly to open the door, ascertain the purpose of your visit and guide you accordingly. He is sincere in his engagement with you. He is undoubtedly the BEST!! 

The majority of the staff are friendly and really do strive to provide outstanding service (though at breakfast I was not initially impressed...but rectified in a few minutes). The night prior to departure a courtesy call was placed inquiring how I enjoyed my stay, thanking me for my patronage and offering a wake up call, transportation for departure and luggage assistance. I have no doubt that if any concerns are brought to the attention of the staff while you are there, that prompt assistance and attention will be provided.","Date of stay: November 2014","Trip type: Traveled solo","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Our first impressions and experience at the hotel was great. The staff were all very friendly, helpful, welcoming and great employees. The hotel is beautiful, the room was a nice size, and the location was convenient. It was great being close to the trolley lines and slightly off the main Waikiki beach drag, the quiet area was perfect. 
The trouble started our third night. We went out for dinner around 8pm and our room hadnt been made up yet. We came back after ten and the turndown service had just been done and the bed made up. After changing I noticed something crawling across the bed, and caught it and killed it in a tissue and realized it was a bedbug. I called the front desk and 2 staff came and took the bug. I got a call back and asked if we wanted to change rooms since they confirmed it was a bed bug, of course we said yes. We had to pack up all of our stuff, and we were moved to a ""sleeper room"" (a temporary room just for that night) by this time it was 1am. We were settling in and I unfolded a pair of shorts that was sitting on the bed in the first room (1006) and another bed bug crawls out! I catch it (photograph it) and call the front desk again. 2 staff came up and retrieved the bug. At this point I am in total panic and feeling disgusted. Now that 2 have been found, I decided to pack up ALL of our clothes and luggage and have them taken away. Our luggage along with new clothing we'd bought had been sitting in the previous room for 2 days, I had no idea if there were more bugs that could have crawled into our luggage or not. As it was the middle of the night there wasnt much more to be done. I tried to sleep but the thought of bed bugs and bringing them home kept me awake most of the night. 

In the morning I talked to the night manager (Akimi) and told her I wanted all of our clothing and luggage cleaned and treated. I was informed that the previous room (1006) was checked for more bugs and the room came back negative for signs of bed bugs. She was apologetic and of course nice, but when I asked her simple questions about how our clothes and luggage would be treated for bed bugs she could not answer right away and had to call house cleaning. After a sleepless night and morning spent looking up treatments for bed bugs I found out that high temperatures, pesticides, freezing temperatures and dry cleaning were effective methods for killing bed bugs and their eggs. I was told that our luggage and delicate clothing (wool sweaters) had been treated with a water based pesticide and the remaining items were washed and dried. But they did not spray the inside of our luggage with the pesticide since they did not want it to stain our luggage...which I didnt really understand since they supposedly sprayed our clothing with it. They brought our luggage and things back but as I am someone who wants to be extra sure and careful I packed up our clothing and requested that our luggage be put in the freezer overnight, which they did. 
We were upgraded to another room for our last 2 nights and were given free breakfast vouchers and laundering for the remainder of our trip. I tried to enjoy the last few days of our trip but the bed bug issue and lack of sleep really put a damper on our honeymoon and my peace of mind. 

I asked to have Jet Luxuries call me about this situation but after 2 days no one called me from their headquarters. So I called them (after being on hold for 15 min) and spoke to Amanda, who was unhelpful and spent the phone call trying to wipe her hands clean of the situation, putting the issue of compensation on the hotel. Infuriating. 

The day of our check out, Jeff O. (another manager) came up to our room and apologized again for our bad experience and gave us a 2 night voucher for an ocean view room, if we ever come back again. All in all a refund for our night of hell and sour second half of our honeymoon would have been more of a compensation, but the hotel did try their best to make us happy and restore our peace of mind, we did appreciate that effort. 

In the end we learned a lot from this trip and will never book through a second agent again, especially not Jet Luxury! It wasn't worth the small savings. Would we stay at the Trump Waikiki again? I think we would, but directly through the hotel. After learning a lot about bed bugs and reading about how they spread I think this situation was bad luck. With the thousands of people coming through these hotels daily from around the world and from neighboring hotels and restaurants it is easy to see how bed bugs could be found in even a 5 star clean hotel. 

We really did like the hotel and the staff, but gave a 2 due to this experience alone. I hope others who read this will pack smart when going on vacation. Keep clothes in plastic bags and off the bed, furniture and floors. I will never travel the same way again...","Date of stay: November 2014","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_20"

We were there for a week and were very impressed with the hotel overall. The staff were very friendly, especially those who valeted our vehicle - every time we collected/returned the vehicle we were greeted by name and asked if they could help with anything. Even if returning from a walk you would always get an ""Aloha!"". 
The room was very nice and was of a good size - the bed was amazingly comfortable with a decent sized bathroom (with 2 sinks). Downside was probably the shower over the bath. The view was nice but only in one direction as blocked by the Sheraton in the other direction. The room didn't have a patio however if we'd paid more we could have had one. A great little kitchenette with most things you'd need. 
Loved the pool however probably not as big as we'd expected. Was fine for the number of people in it while we were there. Location was brilliant for shopping and beach and you can catch the pink trolley to get to Ala Moana shopping mall.

The hotel is one of the best hotels in the world ranging from customer service to the quality of the rooms.
We have stayed at many upscale hotels throughout the United States and Australia (our home country) and even in Hawaii and Trump Waikiki rates as the best.

The friendly customer service really stands out and is evident from the moment you arrive at the hotel.

A special mention must be given to Tony at the omelette station in the breakfast buffet (In Yo). He was very friendly and genuine and gave us lots of tips of what to do in Oahu and the surrounding islands. He even went out of his way to write everything down.

The housekeeping is the best I have experienced at any hotel, it is seamless and non intrusive and there is even a nightly turn down service.

If you have the means, definitely stay at Trump Waikiki. It's probably not the hotel for party goers, but more for a relaxing and luxurious time.

The service at the hotel is exceptional. From the start, when we arrived at the hotel, everyone was super nice. I have stayed in other top hotels but this was different. I almost felt like the hostesses the front desk people, valet, concierge and especially the bell boys treat you like you are someone they know, like a friend they haven't seen for a while. They also very helpful. For example, I had a motorcycle and didn't want to park it in the garage every time. The valet let me park right by the main entrance, so its there when I need it. The room was nice, spacious bathroom, with deep bath tub. There was a refrigerator and small kitchen area which was convenient. We had the city/ mountain view. Very nice! The room was clean. The hotel doesn't seem new but it's very well maintained. It smells good. The room service twice a day, great. Nice touches by them, like putting the Hawaiian necklace in shape of a hart on our bed. The hotel's pool is small. Not a real endless pool. But it was never to crowded. The restaurant and bar on the lobby floor is a great place to have a drink and enjoy the sunset. The Trump hotel is just a short walk to the beach through a nice park., it is located close to everything. Shopping, dining you are right there. You are in Honolulu Waikiki Beach Walk. 
After our stay at the Trump we moved to Maui and stayed at the Ritz-Karlton Kapalua (which I have written a review of). The Trump spoiled us and despite the Ritz-Carlton really tried, it could not match the experience. One mishap from the hotel. My cc was charged for $1200. I called the Trump hotel and it was their mistake. I wasn't to happy about it, but the Trump emailed me gift certificate for $100.

My husband and I just came back from Hawaii last week and we stayed at this property for our 10th anniversary.  We actually got married at the hotel last year so it brought back a lot of memories.  Everything was perfect from the minute we arrived until departure.  When we got out of the cab, a nice gentleman from the bell desk took our luggage right away and asked if we were celebrating any special occasion so we told him about our anniversary.  We saw this gentleman numerous times during our 3 night stay and every time he saw us he'd checked on us and wished us happy anniversary.  Check in was very efficient and I can tell there were a lot of notes in the system because the lady knew about our anniversary and our wedding last year.  We were originally booked in a deluxe partial ocean view studio and they upgraded us to a partial ocean view one bedroom suite and the view from this room was stunning.  There were also a nice note from the hotel wishing us happy anniversary and they had a bottle of sparkling wine waiting for us downstairs at the lounge.  Attache team called to check if everything's okay and if transportation will needed for departure after we checked in and the day before we checked out. The last day, because we had a late flight out, I put in a request for a late check out at 9pm at the time of check in.  The front desk called us the day before and told us unfortunately they will be needing our room for other guests but they will move us to another room on the same floor and we can have that room until 9pm.  I've never stayed at any other hotel that offers nice gesture like this.  After we checked out and moved to a different room, I noticed I left my curling iron in the old room so I called the front desk.  Amber at the front desk called the housekeeping team and they were able to locate it right away and my curling iron was returned back to me in no less than 5 minutes.  After our flawless stay last year, we were worried that when we return this year, something will go wrong and we won't like it as much.  However, the hotel proved itself again and it is somewhere that we will come back every year.  We just love the Trump brand so much that we can't wait to try other hotels under the brand.  We will be staying at their central park location for Valentine's and we can only hope it will be as nice as the Waikiki one.","Date of stay: November 2014","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

House keeping were excellent, cleaning the room twice a day and were generally very responsive to any requests. The location is excellent allowing easy access to all facilities in the Waikiki area.

Only ordinary element was the lobby, which is essentially not much more than a reception desk. Not much opportunity to sit and chat with people from other rooms in the hotel. Hotel is good for privacy, but the set-up does not promote mixing with other guests.","Date of stay: October 2014","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Trump International is perfect for couples.","There is a perfect ambience in the Trump. There is no traditional Hawaiian influence, however, it is a perfect destination for busy couples looking for a relaxed holiday in a sophisticated luxury hotel. The Staff in all areas are exemplary and highly professional. The deluxe studio was modern, well appointed and the views even in the ""partial ocean view"" category were breathtaking. The general comments about the size of the pool are accurate, however there was always plenty of room on lounges and in the pool for all the guests.  Only a short distance to Waikiki and the central shopping area.

This was and still remains one of my favorite hotels but there were a couple issues on this last visit. We arrived late and we're placed in a two bedroom suite which was an upgrade from the one bedroom we reserved. I think the upgrade was related to availability but cannot be sure. Two bedroom was lovely except for very windy balcony. Balcony was on northwest corner of building which offered no protection from wind. We tried to tolerate it but after second night we could not enjoy the sunset because of wind.  It's important to note this wasn't a windy evening in Waikiki. 

We spoke to front desk and we're moved to middle of building on 13 the floor in one bedroom suite.   I noticed bed in two bedroom was more comfy but not markedly. So for the next two mornings we were woken by the sound of garbage truck at 630 am.   The first morning it may have been delivery truck but second morning I got up and looked and it was garbage truck. I was so irritated I called front desk and complained but call was disconnected. I didn't call back because I knew hotel likely did not have control over garbage trucks.

We had a message waiting for us when we returned from manager. He offered to move us to the trump level in a two bedroom suite. Initially I declined since we only had one night remaining in our five night stay but my husband  convinced me so we moved. Needless to say it was spectacular and again bed was super comfy. 

I was very happy with the hotels response to our concerns. This was our second stay and our room on first visit was perfect so we were a little discouraged. We are normally slow to complain but in Hawaii in a 5 star hotel I do feel it should be near perfect.  We will stay again.","Date of stay: October 2014","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Everyone was angelic and met everyone of our needs and requests with smiles and went above and beyond.  The restaurant near the lobby was really wonderful.  We try to avoid hotel restaurants but too tired to venture out.  So pleased we were.  Room was very comfortable, clean and quiet.  Loved the beach bag availability with snack, towels and sunscreen.

Personalised service all the way. Everyone greets you by your name and box of chocolates midway thru our stay. Plus a box of cookies at the start.

We were graciously upgraded from a studio to a 1 bedroom with den - ocean view - which made our trip that much more amazing. The ocean and city views from the 16th floor were spectacular. We loved absolutely everything about this hotel. 

The hotel is a very short walk to the beach and just a few city blocks from world class shopping.

I agree with other reviews that the staff set this hotel apart - they are welcoming and attentive without being the least bit intrusive. From the moment we stepped onto the property to the moment we left, we received personal, friendly service. The hotel itself is sleek and elegant and the rooms are supplied with everything you could possibly need. We ate exclusively on the property - 3 restaurants and room service - and all of our meals were exceptional.

Instantly from the time we arrived until we left we were treated like family.  As others have mentioned you are greeted with a smile and a lei and escorted to the lobby where they give you a cold towel and flavored water (a very welcome refreshment after a long day of travel).  We were upgraded from a partial ocean view suite to a full ocean view suite with a den (quite common practice from the reviews I've read-- not expected by any means but still very nice). Our room was amazing.  Far more than what we could expect or need.  Full kitchen with high-end appliances. More than adequate for anyone who wants to save a little $ and cook.  I suppose now that I'm talking about money, I can mention it as the only possible drawback of the hotel... the price.  But as the saying goes, you get what you pay for.  You will certainly get first class service and an amazing location.  I found the fact that it’s not directly on the beach to be no problem at all.  It was literally a few minutes walk away.  Its proximity to great restaurants and Kalakaua Ave were excellent.  Twice a day housekeeping was a nice touch although our schedule was a bit hectic and it was probably difficult for them to anticipate when we were away.  The pool is on the small size but more than adequate and I never found it to be crowded.  I absolutely recommend sitting on the pool loungers and watching the sunset... AMAZING.  Wish I had done that every day.  Valet service was always quick and the staff extremely friendly (always offering you a water or offering directions).  The complimentary beach bag service was a nice touch too.  I'm rambling a bit so it’s time to wrap it up. If you have the means, I highly recommend staying here.","Date of stay: October 2014","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Honestly the service at this hotel was second to none.
We stayed here with our 16month old, booked a 1bed apartment with a den. The room has everything you could need and more.. We cooked dinner a few times and there was nothing missing in the kitchen to do so. It really felt like a home away from home.
The room was beautifully presented, had a lovely outlook to the water and had great amenities.
The staff were very helpful and so lovely. Despite it being a 400+room hotel they would remember our sons name and greet him each time. 
The hotel also offer you a beach bag with towels, sunscreen and fresh apples so you don't have to worry about taking your own.
We swam at the pool a couple of times and there was always a seat, whether next to the pool or on the terrace adjacent. 
Concierge were also very helpful offering tips on hire cars, travel routes and which day to go to the outlet centre.

They could not be more helpful. They were able to book trips and surf lessons with minimal fuss. They provide beach bags with towels and sunscreen as well as beach toys for the children. They even managed to retrieve a pair of swimming trunks from a palm tree for me!  And everything is done with a smile and a genuine warmth. As I travelled alone with my two children, it was lovely to feel that there was always someone to help.

The spa is understated but the treatments are excellent.  The swimming pool area is fairly small but as we were so close to the beach we didn't use it much.

I loved having a huge kitchen (which had every conceivable gadget) as it meant we could have lazy breakfasts in our pyjamas or late night snacks. 

Hotel is in a good location for the beach and Waikiki town centre. 

It should be noted that there is not much 'going on' i.e. no entertainment, group exercise classes, children's clubs etc but this did mean that it was lovely and relaxing, as well as quiet.  

I would say that I found the restaurant a disappointment, as it seemed to be overpriced and lacked options for vegetarians.  The portions were very small by Hawaii standards.  However, there is so much choice nearby, it is really not a problem.","Date of stay: October 2014","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Our expectations were met with staff on arrival very welcoming and making the check in process after a long flight fabulous. Our room was on the 23rd floor with side views to the beach. We had dinner twice in the veranda restaurant and have no hesitation in recommending it. Good food and I believe good value. Staff again made us feel like we were the only people in the restaurant. The only reason I didn't give this hotel five stars was due to housekeeping. My partner doesn't drink coffee but loves to have tea. Each day we asked for more tea and each day we arrived back to find one tea bag and lots of coffee. The same applied to shampoo and conditioner. Absolutely impossible to get a refill of these products. I went out and purchased some as I was sick of asking. I would think that the tariff would allow some extra tea bags and toiletries. There was also a lack of stationery, we had one A4sheet of paper and three pieces of paper in the note pad by the bedside table. Little things I know but spoils the overall experience. In saying this the night time housekeepers did provide us tea bags when asked and were lovely.

When I arrived, I had been traveling all day due to delays. I got there about nine hours later than I should have. I was eee exhausted. Thankfully, room service is 24-hours. The property is in the heart of everything. A three minute walk through the Outrigger lobby across the street puts you dead on the beach. The first desk to the right is Trump Beach Services which opens at 8:00AM. If you want to spend a good bit of time here,this is where you can rent lounge chairs. Bruno and Melvino are absolute angels. They are friendly, knowledgeable, and welcoming. Steps away is Subway and other little eateries housed in the same building. Convenience is not a problem.Showers are close enough to simply look over your shoulder.The shopping district is amazing and also within walking distance of the property. Just be wary of sales associates on the sidewalks being overly friendly when they greet you. They're usually trying to sucker you in to sitting through a vacation sales pitch for a couple of hours with the promise of some kind of free hot ticket electronic item or a fancy dinner. It's probably legit,but if you're on vacation who wants to sit through a two hour presentation on one? Tell them you'll be back and take a different way around.
 The Trump Hotel staff is accommodating to a fault and they are the real jewels in the crown. Here's an example: Coming back from a tour,I got caught in a downpour on the way back to the hotel. One of the valets (I hate myself for not remembering his name) had a towel waiting for me before I ever saw him. He held my bags and purse while I dried off and encouraged me to relax and take my time. Management can't train you to be that sweet. The rooms were beautiful and the kitchenette was incredibly well appointed. It had every utensil,dish, pot and pan you could think of with a smooth top stove and lovely refrigerator. Maid and turndown services were good, but sometimes after being out most of the morning and in to the afternoon,the room still hadn't been made up.For all else that they do, that is easily forgivable.My only regret in staying here is that I had to leave.","Date of stay: October 2014","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We are a family of four with two teenagers aged 13 and 17 years. We rented a one bedroom ocean view + den and this was ample room for us. We were pleasantly surprised to see that the den had a proper bed in it and was able to be shut off from the rest of the living space. A fully equipped kitchen with more than you could possibly need, we often ate our breakfast on one of the two ocean view balcony's. The master bedroom was a great private space for the adults with its own private balcony and a large bathroom plus walk in wardrobe. I could highly recommend this type of room for a family of four. The children were very excited that a wii was on offer and this provided some much needed down time in an air conditioned room. One of the biggest features of this hotel is the location, close to the beach, shops and restaurants but the best feature is the staff. They are exceptionally friendly and helpful and nothing is ever a problem.

While it's not beachfront property, really none of the hotels are truly beachfront anymore due to all the erosion of Waikiki. The nearby Sheraton and Halekulani really have no beach in front of them and are just seawalls next to the ocean. The Trump on the other hand is just a 100ft walk from the best beach in Waikiki, which is the part next to Fort DeRussy Park. The beach in this location is wide, not crowded at all, and safe with Military MP's patrolling from the Hale Koa. 

Since there is a short walk to the beach, the Trump provides free beach bags with towels, water, and fruit that are very convenient. 

Another big plus about this hotel is there is no nickel-and-diming. I am so tired of going to hotels and being forced to pay surprise resort fees. The folks at the Trump do none of this. Wifi, bottled water, beach bags, little bottles of sunscreen, specialty pillows, etc. are all included in the room charge. They even have complimentary late check out, if space is available. The only extra fee was $33/night valet, which I guess is to be expected.

Also while most hotel staff in Hawaii are friendly, the staff at Trump go above and beyond. They are always looking for ways to make your stay better. For example, I mentioned that I liked the tea bags provided in the room to a staff member and for the rest of my stay, there were always extra tea bags when I returned to my room.  

I have nothing really negative to say about the place, other than the Trump branding is a little cheesy. But the hotel doesn't have any kind of pretentious NYC vibe to it, and definitely keeps things Hawaiian. Also, this is probably not the best hotel for families with kids as the pool is on the smaller side and mostly for lounging. Overall, excellent property and great stay!","Date of stay: October 2014","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The staff went out of their way to make our stay as pleasant as possible. 
The insulated beach bags with towels, water, sunscreen and fruit were great and made a trip to the beach easy. On the beach you could rent paddle boards, loungers and umbrellas and have it charged back to your room. With the insulated bag we found we didn't need to take any cash over. The pool was an enjoyable place to relax, with water flavoured with fruit on tap. Reading material provided to read and a very comfortable sun lounger. 
The room was clean, comfortable and very well serviced. The kitchen was well equipped with everything we needed and more. We didn't use the rice cooker. 
Shampoo, body lotion and all bathroom products provided were really nice, and I must also mention the beds and pillows, they were extremely comfortable.

if you rent a moped and explore everything.

Trump hotel is clean...""not moldy"" which is a huge
problem with almost evry other hotel in Waikiki.

Most of the hotels need to be remodeled and all
that old carpet and dated bathrooms be repaired
but money is what motivates the hotel owners so
98% of waikiki hotels suck....and cater to japanese
and americans who they can rip off. Trump is in a
class all by itself...even Sheraton can't match and
Embassy too...Hilton barely makes the grade in this
location....so i prefer Trump....and willingly pay more
cause i like Hawaii and this beach and the food...

Kauai is a different story...very nice but deals on a
trip there are harder to find.  Just be warned...most 
hotels in waikiki need to be upgraded badly....so
stay here and have a great time.","Date of stay: January 2014","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

We stayed here for 5 days last year and from the moment we drove up to the hotel we were greeted with impeccable service. As we checked in, I told the friendly staff my boyfriend's parents were celebrating their 30th anniversary and ask if there were any upgrades available since we had 5 people and we booked a 2 bedroom suite. The friendly front desk staff offered to upgrade us to a 2 bedroom suite w/ a den on the trump floor. They even gave us a complimentary bottle of champagne for my boyfriend's parents' anniversary. When we walked into the room we were amazed with the sheer size of the suite and the full kitchen had everything from a rice cooker to baking sheets. We had an amazing view of the ocean and a front row seat to the fireworks show on Fridays . During the entire length of our stay the hotel staff was friendly and helpful. They even offer beach bags with sunscreen, towels, water, and fruits. They truly made my boyfriend's parents anniversary very special and memorable and I can't thank them enough for that. 

We will be going to Honolulu again in a few days and of course we will be staying at the Trump again and I hope we will have the same amazing experience as we did last time. We loved the Trump so much that we convinced our friends to book their room at the Trump as well.

My husband and I arrived on 9/25 thru 9/30.  From the time we got off the shuttle we were greeted with leis and such a warm welcome.  The staff, bell men, concierge, house keeping and front desk all went out of their way to make our stay the best.  We stayed in the studio deluxe with partial ocean view and it was exceptional.  We had maid service twice a day.  A five minute walk to the beach where we rented chairs and umbrella from the Trump booth along with they give you beach bags with sun block, towels, water and fruit in it.  This was by far the best vacation I have ever been on.  I'm very picky about where I stay and the Trump was like being at home.  It was very clean and the bathroom had a big soaking tub and the shower was wide open next to tub.  If you like luxury and care about where you stay this is the place for you.  If i ever go back this will be my choice again.  To all of the Trump employees you should all be commended on the job you have done and are doing.  Keep up the good work.

The attitude of the staff was pleasant and check in and check out were quick and seamless.  The concierge was helpful and quickly organized a surf lesson for us.  A great touch the hotel offered, for no charge, were these beach bags they would give when you went surfing or to the beach -- the bag itself was durable, the towels very good, sun screen was in the bag, as well as water and an apple/orange.  The location of the hotel is very good -- maybe 400 yards from the front doors to the ocean. The room itself was nice but the hotel is showing a few signs of being close to the beach -- just a little beat up and not truly high end 5 star.

An example of some basic 5 star components that I thought were missing given we were in Waikiki : (1) small infinity pool -- this is the only pool in the hotel and it is small and not made for having a swim, super disappointing; (2) odd and poorly located gym -- again small with basic equipment -- view is poor and just not well set up; (3) due to the heat and my activity level I was quickly using up the shampoo, conditioner, and body lotion which was not replaced upon the room being cleaned -- I tend to blame management for this type of failure because you can just drill into everyone's head to make sure this stuff is full and plentiful before leaving the room on cleaning.

The hotel is priced at 5 star rates but just does not deliver -- still this may be the best Waikiki has to offer.","Date of stay: September 2014","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

We can't recommend Trump enough. This time we stayed 11 nights and loved every second of it. Highly recommend the Fort De Russy side of the hotel which has views over the ocean and Waikiki Beach. We were able to watch the weekly Friday night Hilton Fireworks from our balcony. It was awesome.

The room itself is wonderful. We stayed in a one bedroom plus den. Very spacious and having the kitchen and a washer/dryer just made it so economical. 

The staff - from the cleaners to concierge the staff cant do enough for you. In particular our cleaner Jena, Dean the doorman and Gemma at concierge.

I'm not a fan of Oahu (too crazy and touristy), but the Trump is a piece of serenity that is available amidst the chaos.  Both times I've been here the majority of guests were not Americans so it seems to be a hidden jewel for well heeled international tourists.  

The staff is what makes this place exceptional and the customer service experience from start to finish has been top notch during both of my stays.  They are very attentive and genuinely nice.  From the lobby lounge/restaurant to the valets, housekeeping, and concierge, everyone is more than willing to ensure you have a wonderful stay.  There were a couple people in the lounge I remembered from my first trip so this must be a nice place to work! 

The rooms are very nicely done and were originally meant to be condos.  I very much appreciated the kitchen with fridge, stovetop, microwave, and a host of utensils!  With a patio room it is an incentive to stay in the room and relax.  The bed is one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in and there is a cozy feeling that provides an oasis from the tourists. 

The bathroom is my major complaint. The lighting is horrible (and non-adjustable) and the mirrors are awkwardly placed so check your body image issues at the door.  The shower is lame and awkwardly open.  If there's anything they should re-do at this hotel it is the bathrooms as I do not like them at all.

The Wai'olu Lounge is one of the treasures of the Trump.  The happy hour specials (3pm - 6pm) are surprisingly reasonable and delicious.  Kona beer for $3!  The Crispy Thai wings and nachos are amazing!  If you don't like seafood, there aren't a whole lot of options but if you do like it you will find plenty of choices.  I could have eaten every meal at the lounge as going outside of it is nothing but tourist traps and annoyances.  During my first trip I did the breakfast buffet and it was excellent but definitely caters to Japanese tourists so if you like Japanese food it is an added bonus for you.  

The beach is across the street and you can get a bag to take with you.  Lovely idea but I find the beach unimpressive and kind of trashy.  I would much rather spend my time by the small, but lovely infinity pool where I can look at the ocean from a distance. The pool can get a bit crowded but I didn't have any problems getting a chair during my visit.  The pool is a great place to watch the sunset (as is the lounge).  

Parking (valet only) is a stiff $33 a night but I got a rental car so cheap that it was worth it.  There are no silly wifi or ""resort"" fees here so this was my major expense besides eating and drinking in the lounge.  

Donald Trump is known for his lofty statements of grandeur but with this property he is right when he says ""the best.""  I can't imagine a better experience in Waikiki.  I don't have any intention to return to Oahu anytime soon as I do not like it and feel like I've done everything.  Waikiki is like Orlando on a beach so if that fits your style, you will love it.  However, if I ever did come back, the Trump is the only place I would stay.

Read me for details!","First: if you want the opinion of someone who is very picky and quick to point out fault read further. 

The Trump International is phenomenal!

My wife and I stayed here for 8 days for our 1 year anniversary.

The service is above and beyond any thing I could have hoped for. 
From the minute we got there until we left nothing but A+ service.

The concierge was exceptional!!! 
I called them no less than 20  times during the stay. All my questions/request were addressed and accommodations made.

Ocean view suite:The room was magnificent! We had a great unobstructed view of Waikiki beach. 

One bed 2 bathrooms, den, full kitchen and living room. This place rocked. All updated appliances subzero wolf.  This was great because we ate at someplace different each time and always had extra to take home. Coffee/tea maker even a juicer. All plates glasses cups silver wear were included in the room.

Even a dishwasher!

In Trump fashion these were designed as condos were you may choose to live, so it felt very comfy. Not small and closed in at all.

The infinity pool was great. We never used it during the day but at night there were very few people there and the water was warm as was the jacuzzi. Great views at night highly recommend. Open until 10pm

There are 3 places to eat on the hotel and we tried all of them.  There were all very good and convenient but there are a lot of place to get out and try so don't stay inside the hotel all day.

Room service is available 24/7.
Although we didn't use it. It was nice know we could.

Rules: 
If you want an inexpensive hotel and plan on doing nothing but staying on beach all day everyday, This is not the place to go. 

If you demand upscale quality and service all the convinces of home yet the beach tourist attractions and lots of shopping and dinning are at your fingertips this is the place. 

This is also a family friendly place I saw quite a few children in the hotel but it's not the feeling you get when you see kids running all over the hotel without parents sand on their feet tracking it everywhere yelling and screaming. At least in 8 days I never was that.

This is also not a hotel I would recommend if you are on a tight budget.  The only reason I mention this is because I think an upgrade to an ocean view suite is a must at minimum. Any of the poor reviews you read were likely people who stayed in a studio without a view... Spend the extra money it's worth it.

On Friday night there is a fireworks show that you can actually see from your room so once agin spend the extra money if you can.

Experiencing things in Hawaii is more than going to the beach. Many of us can do that without traveling quite as far. It's a great opportunity to experience the Hawaiian   culture and the beauty of the country.  

My point is as nice as the hotel was we spent 70% of the day out doing things on other parts of the island or out side of our room. But it was great to come back to such a lovely place at the end of our day.  We will be back for another stay soon!!

Hope this helps clear up any polluted views.","Date of stay: September 2014","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I found it to be a little cold with not much ambiance. Other hotels have live music with places to get a coffee or ice cream but this hotel has none of that. The pool is unbelievably  small and the lounge area around the pool is also tight. Most of the pool area faces a huge condo building.  It's not a resort style hotel so if you're looking for something on the small side, then this for you. I would probably stay at one of the larger hotels on the beach next time,  so I'd have more options under one roof.
  The staff is wonderful and always looking to help. Our room was on a high floor and we had partial ocean view, very nice. We had massages at the spa which were good but I asked the receptionist, if after my massage, I could take a bath instead of a shower, both were in the same room as my massage. She said the shower was fine but if I took a bath, she'd have to charge me an additional 20$ per person!

They have quite comfortable room with nice view and all the staffs are very helpful and polite; they cooked chicken noodles for me when I was sick and gave me loads and loads of water (the cleaning lady insisted that I drink them all) 
The hotel is very close to Waikiki beach, It takes less than 3 minutes to walk there. They also have those cool bags you can bring to the beach, just ask the concierge. And around the corner is a wonderful Gelato.

We had a very nice view of Fort Russell and the ocean beyond. Trump is far from the cheapest hotel on Waikiki Beach so I expected to get a clean, well lit contemporary room with a decent bathroom and furniture. My expectations in this respect were met. Maid service and bell service were also very attentive. There is free WiFi.

The studio room comes with a studio kitchen. While most people paying top dollar to stay at Trump won't be self-catering to save money, allow me to suggest that using the kitchen for a light breakfast and perhaps one other meal a day saves you a LOT of unhealthy American restaurant calories, as going out for 3 meals a day can get excessive after a couple of days. My decision to prepare our own breakfast and dinner (we had lunches out) was not to save money but to eat well. (Cheesecake Factory, P.F. Changs, many sushi houses and steak restaurants of varying quality are within walking distance and you can get a huge meal anytime you want.) Appliances are:  glass stovetop (with a fan), microwave, kettle, toaster, rice cooker, steamer, coffee machine, egg beater (NO OVEN). The kitchen is fully stocked with pots/pans, dishes, utensils and flatware. The only thing you can't do is bake. There are many ABC convenience stores on every corner of Waikiki Beach and these have dairy (milk, yogurt, eggs), fresh produce, a deli and a frozen section. For fresh meat and fish you will have to go to a real grocery store but that is not hard to do.

The infinity pool is on the 6th floor and is an extension of the open-air lobby and lounge/restaurant. Water was warm and easy to get into. It's more of an quiet adult relaxation pool than a kids' recreational pool -- no loud Marco Polo games, no diving, depth maxes out at 4 feet, cocktails served poolside until 6pm. But you can swim short laps or lounge in the pool looking over the ocean and watching the sunset. We really enjoyed the pool and went every evening.

I cannot speak for the hotel restaurants because we never ate there, but I do recommend going to the 6th floor open lounge to have a cocktail at sunset or in the evening. The view is beautiful and the cocktails are well made.

If we ever go back to Waikiki, we would definitely stay here again.","Date of stay: September 2014","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We were not disappointed as it was a low key, but luxurious hotel.  We originally booked a deluxe ocean view room and at check-in were upgraded to a 2 bedroom ocean view suite which was a nice surprise. The suite was at the end of the hallway. It was a huge space with 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a full kitchen (complete with a wine chiller), dining room, living room and sweeping view from mauka to makai.  The room was well appointed and spotless. The bedtime turn down service included a chilled bottle of water which was nice.

Upon check-in the staff is very welcoming and friendly.  We had the breakfast buffet at In-Yo which provided a good variety of American and Asian foods.  The staff was very attentive.  The buffet includes a variety of made to order smoothies - the Lilikoi & Guava was delicious!  

The hotel is within walking distance to many Waikiki restaurants and shops. 

The one small downside is that the pool is rather small and there is not much space to lounge poolside.  On the plus side, the hotel is right across the street from the beach (there is a beach access walkway between two hotels) and the concierge will provide beach towels, water and sunscreen to take with you.","Date of stay: August 2014","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We asked the concierge for help with rental cars and tours of Pearl Harbor and all worked out well.  The breakfast buffet and room service were wonderful.  We have eaten in BLT restaurants in both Puerto Rico and New York and found the food here good, but overpriced ( as it is all over Hawaii).  Our only caution in recommending this hotel is that it isn't a great location for anyone wanting to be right on the beach.  Even though the beach was only 1 block away, it wasn't the main section of Waikiki and we found it too rocky for swimming and rediculously narrow.

Made to feel special from the moment we arrived.  Bit of an issue with the room not being ready as our agent had booked the wrong bed combo but we finally got our sea view suite and it was worth waiting for,
Waikiki will not be to everyone's taste.  Very busy, lots of high rise hotels etc.  Reminded me of Benidorm with higher class shopping.  Therefore car hire is essential as you can use the hotel as a base and explore the island at will and very easily.  Watch for traffic at peak times as traffic jams appear to be the norm. 
Returning to the hotel in the evening was always a treat however and great location for popping out for restaurants etc.
On the down side the pool area was taken over by younger children who presumably were too young for the sea which is a stones throw away and pool service stops at 6pm.  Otherwise fantastic with a special mention for the staff including Michael in the restaurant who really new his stuff.","Date of stay: August 2014","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

I was in Waikiki on a 24 hour lay over and my hostel wouldn't let me check in until 2 and I landed at 8 am and had nowhere to go.  I was really exhausted after an uncomfortable 9 hour overnight flight from Australia when I crossed paths with Melvino when walking through the area that they rent out beach equipment.
Nonetheless, I think that he is a walking example of that hospitable, welcoming, laid back, hawaiian attitude that locals are known for. I felt totally spoiled and relaxed as I took a nap on one of their chairs and took a swim with their blow up turtle. I was totally taken care of there. I didn't have any American cash on me as I had just landed from Australia so I felt really bad that I didn't have anything to tip him with so I thought it is the VERY LEAST I could do to refer others to him.

We chose this hotel based on the excellent TripAdvisor reviews and they were spot on. This is a classy hotel full of excellent amenities. You can read about them in detail in the other reviews. 
The jewel in the crown of this hotel is the staff. Nothing is too much trouble and their manners are impeccable. We checked in really late and we were so tired! The staff made the experience fast and pleasant, a gift as we saw people queuing to check into other hotels nearby. Our studio was upgraded on arrival and we got an ocean view. As you can imagine, facilities in the hotel are expensive so, if you are on a budget, maybe pick one treat per day from the hotel as we did. The fact that the studio had a kitchen meant that we could stock up and not just rely on the hotel for food. We also discovered a fantastic website called room service in paradise which delivered food to the hotel from over 50 local restaurants. We had quite the culinary adventure without having to leave our room. 
We received a welcome gift on arrival - gorgeous cookies. Then, after a few nights, another gift- chocolates! Personal touches like that makes this hotel stand out. 
We stayed here as two hurricanes threatened the islands. The staff were absolutely superb! They explained everything to us and kept us up to date on the news as they kept the hotel running like clockwork during what must have been a stressful time. Luckily the hurricanes didn't hit Oahu in the end. 
A special thanks to the housekeeping staff who worked around our schedule in cleaning the room and keeping us supplied with anything we needed. 
On our final day we were given a late check out time of 7pm to facilitate our late night flight. Nothing was too much trouble. 
This hotel has a lot of Japanese guests. It was lovely to learn more about the Japanese culture as we talked to fellow guests and tried the Japanese food served at the hotel. Little tip when ordering dishes in the hotel: ask if the dish is cooked or raw and what size the portion is. The staff are lovely and happy to help. 
Overall, I can't praise this hotel enough. It was a special place to stay and got our honeymoon off to the best possible start. It was worth the 30+ hours travel time from Ireland when this hotel is waiting at the other end! While you expect excellent facilities in such a hotel, it really is the staff that makes it special. My only negative feeling was the sadness of leaving after 9 wonderful nights.","Date of stay: August 2014","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

After requesting twin beds in one bedroom, I was disappointed to find a king bed and to be told there were no other rooms available with twin beds - not a great end to a holiday for a teenage boy & girl. Eventually we were offered a rollaway bed which was a compromise but had to be folded away during the day due to lack of room.
On the plus side, the rest of the room features were great and the staff fantastic. Great position, great dining and the weather turned out to be fantastic as well.","Date of stay: September 2013","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

The rooms (suites) are amazing, the food is delicious and there really isn't much to be said in terms of what I didn't enjoy.

Sure, the shower in our master bathroom sat on the wrong wall, and the hose was so stiff that the water splashed out onto the bathroom floor rather than staying inside the shower. That's what happens when interior designers are let loose without any common sense making sure it will work in real life… 

Sure, the so called ""Attaché"" program is a joke (they call you to make sure you're okay, but in terms of actually adding value? Naaah, they told us to go out shopping ourselves or to call the concierge. right…)

The real achilles heel of this hotel is their staff. Some are absolutely amazing, like the hostess Julia who welcomed us with a warm smile and who sent us home with a hug. People like that are hard to find. Stunning. Most of the people at the Trump are like that. 

Then there are some of the staff who seem to be mentally somewhere else. We met most of them at the In-Yo, the breakfast place. There were days when the service was so bad you had to almost go drag someone to help you out, and the hostesses smiled about one out of ten times we saw them.

I've also used their spa services and they are really good. I mean for all the draping and tucking they do to preserve your 'dignity', the massage was actually really good, and Abraham put me to sleep within seconds. Highly recommended.

Upon arriving at the hotel we were given a room upgrade which was a nice way to start the trip. The hotel is very well maintained with helpful and friendly staff. 

This is very much a hotel and not a resort. The hotel is just off the beginning of the main strip of Waikiki, about 5 min walk to the beach. They have a small pool with a few loungers but the main attraction is the beach. The hotel will provide you with a fully stocked beach bag as you leave, and you drop it back on your way in for it to be filled again. It includes towels, water. suncream and a snack....very thoughtful and convenient. 

The location is perfect as the shops are all in walking distance but you are not right in the middle of the hustle and bustle. If walking seems to much there is a direct bus route and you can purchase a travel pass which lasts for three days. Also, don't through your bus ticket away. If you keep your ticket you can use it again for another bus trip within two hours!

Every friday there are fireworks on the beach - don't miss it.

They provide complimentary beach bags on the ground floor complete with fluffy beach towels, chilled Trump water, sun lotion and fresh fruit.

There were three staff that stood out and made our trip extra special. Julia or Julie, downstairs concierge helped us with everything! So genuine and kind.

One went out of his way to get us directions to the Best Buys (To get the GoPro cameras) and the other was always on hand helping with bags and directions (Younger, with really amazing eyes).

HOWEVER, if you are looking for a property with amazing customer service and comfortable stay then this is where you need to visit. 

I came here on a family holiday with my wife and parents. We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite and had a wonderful stay.  They provide complimentary towels, water, sunscreen and fruit when visiting the beach.  Moreover, any complaint you have, they make it a priority to make sure you are happy. We received food after a long wait and when we got it, it was cold (this was poolside). The manager came out and made sure they recooked the food and made all items (food and drinks) on the house.

We wanted a suite higher up in the building - they called us daily to move us up. 

We had a late flight out (ie 10:40pm) - they accommodated us in another room for free until 8pm in the evening.

I travel worldwide and have never considered hotels in the US to have decent (not even good) customer service.  However, at the Trump Waikiki you see the eastern hospitality in action. They don't leave any stone unturned to make sure you leave happy.

I just wish the hotel was on the beach itself but the 1 minute walk to the beach is no competition for the amazing customer service.  Additionally, the pool is a bit small and is flooded with children in the afternoons.

It'll be hard to consider another location when visiting Waikiki next time.","Date of stay: July 2014","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Surrounded with trump style, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. 
The service was extraordinary! 

Our towels were replaced perfectly with extras every single day - the place was always immaculate after housekeeping and they left us a wonderful welcome present upon our arrival. 

Pure luxury, the complimentary toiletries are amazing! I particularly loved the sugar scrub the most. The kitchen was beautiful with a hidden cupboard fridge, wine cooler too. However there was no drying rack for dishes and not enough tea bags haha! 

We dined at the in hotel lobby cafe many times - it was wonderful - reasonably priced but well worth it. 

Try the fish and chips if your hungry! Or the turkey wrap for something light and healthy - and don't go past a strawberry piña colada - my favourite. 

The pool is also really really nice, smallish but with plenty of tanning space! The gym is very very small but there's enough space there - the complimentary infused water is definitely a bonus!

In this regard, the Waikiki property aligned with the brand.  Each employee, from the front desk to the room cleaners presented a professional, warm manner, much like the gracious hosts they were.  We remained on the property for seven nights, allowing for a long-term perspective of the workings of the property.  Located on busy Waikiki beach, it was an easy walk to great restaurants, shopping, public transportation and the beach itself.  
The hotel had several unique features.  When guests used the beach, upon entering the beach area, a Trump employee provided a free of charge bag with sunblock, towel, and a bottle of water.  This same bag was given each time we left the property for a day trip. The hotel also provides for twice daily room cleaning which given the active lifestyle most guests engage in, was a valued offering.  Following the second cleaning, the water bottles were replaced, all linens changed and toiletries added.  Finally, each room had some type of kitchen or kitchenette. We were therefore able to stock the refrigerator with groceries and do some cooking with a two burner stove and microwave.  The larger suites allow for in room washer and dryer- a gift to travelling  families.
Our initial room did not have an ocean view.  After contacting the front desk for an available alternative, one was quickly offered that provided the desired view, a larger room and lanai for approximately $100 more per day, a discount off of the $175 standard charge.
The only concern with the property relates to the height of the ceilings- lower than standard on each hallway and room. It did not detract from the quality of the room itself, but presented a somewhat claustrophobic feel in the hallways that were not as well air conditioned as the rooms and therefore contributed to the tight feeling.
While we traveled with multiple people including a family with children, all of whom enjoyed the property, the hotel is more adult friendly than child friendly.  For example, the pool was fairly small for the size of the hotel and had a limited number of chaises and chairs surrounding it.  The better options would be to  use the beach or visit any one of a number of memorable Honolulu sites.","Date of stay: June 2014","Trip type: Traveled on business","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The pool is a bit odd, very small but still we loved it and we loved the international crowd that we met at the pool each day.  Truly an amazing family vacation!","Date of stay: June 2014","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

We booked via the American Express Fine Hotels & Resorts program and received all of the benefits associated with the program including upgrade to a 1bdr with den, spa credit, breakfast buffet for two, and early/late check in and check out (which was beneficial since our flight home left late in the evening and we were able to keep our room through 6pm on the departure day. 

Every-Every-Everything in the reviews is true about the Trump from arrival to departure we were treated with the highest customer service by every employee we encountered. The room was kept clean (2 x day) by a very nice housekeeping crew. My wife enjoyed the full size hair dryer. The restaurants were especially welcoming and well ran. I would like to send a special thanks to the Wai’olu Ocean view Lounge! We had reservations for the 4th (recommended by the Attache Manager Ms. Sato) at 6:30 which allowed for us to both watch the sunset and the Ala Moana Fireworks display. Michael, the head server, could not have been more pleasant and accommodating. He and the rest of the staff were very helpful and made the evening (also an anniversary celebration) wonderful. We actually came back the next day to take advantage of the sunset menu/happy hour and had an equally excellent experience. Yes we ate other places (though we didn’t make it to BLT) but definitely enjoyed the hospitality of the Trump restaurants. 

We chose the beach rather than the pool (it seemed nice just not our thing) and please head down to the concierge in the morning and ask them to reserve an umbrella and chairs at the beach ahead of time. The Trump has a desk outside the Outrigger for Trump guests and when we showed up each day the staff had a set of chairs/umbrella and table with our name on it (all billable to your room). The beach desk crew was helpful as well, though expect a sales pitch on Maui Jim sunglasses. We did not have our kids with us but the hotel leaves a welcome gift, champagne on our anniversary, and note from the manager. And while there were plenty of families on the property it did not seem as chaotic as other hotels in Honolulu that we have stayed at in the past.","Date of stay: July 2014","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

A big thank you to all the staff at the Trump International for making our holiday special, we would definitely return to Honolulu and our first choice would be to stay at the Trump as the staff go above and beyond to make you feel welcome. We stayed in a 1 Bedroom Premium Ocean View suite with den, it was very spacious however the sofa beds are not great for adults to sleep on as the mattress was quite thin however one call to housekeeping and this was immediately resolved as they changed them both to double bed mattresses.. If we were to go again we would probably upgrade to a Two Bedroom with den to give us more space. The pool area is quite small but we never found it a problem to find a sunbed and it was very relaxing and peaceful, after looking at other hotels on the beach front we were really glad we did not go to any of these hotels as the pool areas were very busy and noisy and would suit families with children.

The staff are exceptional from the moment you arrive you transported to a place that weary travellers had long thought disappeared. That is a place where the guest comes first, second, third and any other place they care to choose. When Dean greets you in the driveway his warms smile and confident handshake lets you know you have made the right choice! Julia speeds you through the check-in process and no-one delivers your luggage the way Rob does! His manner is exceptional! 

Once inside the room the Wii has been set up for the vacation evenings when going out is too much to think of. The rooms are luxurious and fresh and clean and warm. They are where you want to be. The beach is a short stroll and the staff at the concierge desk pack a beach bag of fresh fruit, water, towels and sunscreen. Their knowledge of the local attractions is wonderful.

And a great pool area!","My partner and I stayed at The Trump for a week in June and endorse every superlative that has already been written of the hotel

It is the attention to detail that raises the Trump to another level from other hotels - 12 towels of every size in the bathroom, 8 pillows plus a pillow menu if one of those doesn't suit, washing up that magically disappears in the twice daily servicing and more bottles of water stocked in the fridge than we could possibly drink.
Having a kitchen made the hotel great value as well as it feeling like a home away from home. Breakfast or lunch or even staying in and cooking one or two nights using the fresh Hawaiian produce available from the super mart was a pleasure

A very special thank you to the attaché who upgraded us to a deluxe studio on a high floor with a partial ocean view that stretched from the ocean to the mountains. Also to the the housekeeping staff who worked their schedule around my rest times once they realised I had been ill. 
Mahalo. I am very grateful. Your thoughtfulness was much appreciated.

I would just like to write a little about the pool which was one of the reasons I chose The Trump:

- the pool is on the sixth floor so there is no chaos from people tramping through the hotel
- it is an infinity pool. It was wonderful to float on the edge and look out over the ocean of Waikiki 
- the pool looks deceptively 'small' because of its long narrow shape. It is almost the width of the hotel. If you could change the shape it would be relatively the same area as many of the beachfront hotels. I was able to do laps of the pool in comfort
- the pool is in the sun all day and the temperature of the water is warm but refreshing with a bubbling hot spa attached.
- there are lounges on two sides of the pool deck, one of which is on a lower split level
- iced, fruit infused water, magazines and mountains of towels are provided. Service staff are attentive but not intrusive
- the loungers were thick and comfortable and plentiful, and staff fitted them with covers before use
- from the deck I could look down on two other hotels' pool areas. The Outrigger Reef pool is not large and only received sun for the middle of the day because of the tall buildings on either side. As a result the loungers were mainly stacked three deep towards one end where the sun reaches. On the other side was the Embassy Suites which does have a large pool. However, I guess because it caters to families the pool was usually busy, noisy and crowded. One afternoon I counted 34 people, mainly children, in the pool, and a further six in the hot tub - plus inflatable mattresses, pool rings and balls. The size of a pool is always relative!!

I loved my stay at The Trump. I came home with a tan, a novel finally read, too much shopping(!), relaxed and with the biggest smile.
Thank you. I hope to see you again soon.","Date of stay: June 2014","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The fridge is large with two freezers, not sure why we would need freezers except for ice and both have auto ice makers.

This time my husband and I stayed for 5 nights.  We were upgraded to a room on the 31st floor with ocean views and kitchen. The room was spacious, the bathroom luxurious and the kitchen well equipped.  The thing we loved was being able to open all the windows and have the beautiful sea breezes day and night (there was a quite a bit of street noise but this didn't disturb us). The service from hotel staff was, without exception, efficient and courteous. This is a great hotel in a great location with easy access to shopping, restaurants, beach and transport.

I stay in a lot of hotels for work and very rarely can I say the people, service, accomodation, food and beverage and amenities were perfect but in this case they were.  I visited with my family to celebrate a birthday and the Trump made the holiday.  The room we stayed in (Ocean view, 2 bed suite) was better than a home away from home.  The little touches like a gift for my daughter and a birthday cake were unexpected and welcome.  The ease of check in - and yes, having a room ready without fuss four hours early helps ease the fatigue from a 14 hour journey from Australia.  The pool is small but all you need if you are happy to spend time on the beach - just a short walk away and easy to tackle with the Trump beach bag of supplies.

Absolutely the best! Love it!","This is our 2nd time to Honolulu and last time we only stayed for one night then we were on the cruise.This time we stayed few nights at Aulani Disney Resort then 3 nights at Trump. We have never stayed at Trump before but after reading lots of positive reviews, we've decided to give it a try. I did have some expectation before arriving after reading the reviews, people getting upgraded to a better room, getting all kinds of different gifts, etc. 

We arrived around noon but our room was not ready, the staff at check-in saw we're with 2 young kids so she offered us a hospitality room to rest while waiting for our room. How nice! Our room was ready at 3pm, and just before dinner time someone brought us a cake (for my husband's birthday), some cake pops (for the kids), and a box of Honolulu Cookies (for me)!! What a surprise! I didn't even remember if I've mentioned my husband's birthday when I booked my room but I have registered for the Trump Card and it is beyond my expectation that they did look into small details and sent us the gifts. After we came back from dinner we saw some plush toys and coloring books/crayons for the kids. They were so excited!

The only comment I have is with the sofa bed, it is quite soft especially compared to the king size bed. So maybe next time we'll need to book a room with 2 beds and no sofa bed. Also we stayed at the 18th floor facing Lewers Street, there are lots of bars and restaurants so it could be noisy once you open up the balcony door. 

I could just go on and on about all the great services we've received during our 3 nights stay. They got us a limo taxi to go to the zoo, gave us the beach bag filled with towels, water, sunscreen, fruits, and sand toys. Last but not least, we had a 10pm departure flight and we were offered a late check-out at 8pm with no extra charge. How can we not like Trump Waikiki!!??","Date of stay: June 2014","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

While not directly on the beach, it is literally a stone's throw stroll, and you'll be pampered with your own beach towels (as many as you like), sunscreen, water, and an insulated beach bag.  Once there, we were fortunate to make the acquaintance of the Trump Beach Walk's Beach Assistant named Al'li who took an interest in activities we had planned and gave us some great advice.  We are 'ocean' people so the fact that the pool was not massive didn't matter to us.

We love it! Nothing is too much trouble for the lovely staff and they go out of their way to be attentive to your every need. On this visit, we were upgraded to a one bedroom with a den overlooking Fort DeRussy and the beach, so we could watch the Hilton fireworks from our balcony. The beach view is stunning as are the sunset views. There was even a beautiful ""Welcome Back"" floral arrangement on the dining table! Rooms at Trump are spacious and well appointed and the bathrooms are stocked with good range of toiletries.  I love the thick dressing gowns! One of the reasons that we like this hotel so much is that they have really thought about what people need when they are on holiday. For example, an  insulated bag with two towels, two bottles of water, an apple, an orange and sunscreen are provided for you when you go to the beach. Complimentary bottles of water each day are also great when you are going out for a walk.

Trump has set new standard of quality and customer service.","After reading amazing reviews of the Trump Waikiki I planned a 3 day stay at this property with my wife and two kids as part of a 10 day trip to Hawaii (Oahu and Kauai). As soon as we arrived at the hotel we were taken to the lobby and were offered cold towels and flavored water before check in as well Hawaiian necklaces as part of welcome reception.  We had booked a one bedroom studio ocean view and were upgraded to a two bedroom studio ocean view. When we arrived at the room we were speechless with the quality, size and attention to details of the room. Simply amazing!!! The room was gigantic with two full bathrooms, full high end size kitchen, two balconies, two sofa beds, dinning table and laundry. There was a box of local shortbread cookies and many free bottles of water. However, the attention to our kids was amazing. There were two stuffed animals (whales), cake pops, bath robes and slippers, coloring books and crayons as well as an envelop in the name of each of my kids with a welcoming letter and information about free kids movies and video games they could order in the room. Remember, all free. That is where Trump puts itself in a category above other luxury hotels. I say that because we already paid more than $600 per night for the room so Trump does an amazing job in not charging extras for small details that makes your stay very special. Most hotels charge you for everything but I prefer to pay more for my rate but be pampered without having to pay extra for everything. Also, the toiletries products were amazing and they thought about every luxury product we could ever need. In the bathroom there was a little plastic bench so the kids could reach the faucet. Again, small details that amazed us. Next day we went for breakfast which was included for 2 under my Fine Hotels and Resorts package and the quality and selection was amazing. There was an American and a Japanese buffet which you could get anything. Also, they had a menu of other options you could order at no charge. Again, great quality at no extra fees. My kids ordered fresh made pancakes,  waffles and fruit smoothies. We got cold milk chocolate and one of the best cappuccinos I had in many years. Then we asked for our car to head to the beaches. By the time we got downstairs the concierge ladies were phenomenal. They packed a beach bag for us with beach towels, sunscreen, cold water and fresh fruits and provided personalized maps and attractions depending on what area of the island we wanted to visit. Once more the attention to details was jaw dropping. In sum, we had an amazing stay at the Trump and we are already planning our next trip back to Honolulu next year or I should probably say our trip back to Trump Waikiki next year. If you are looking for luxurious accommodations and likes to be treated like royalty this is the place to stay. I never stayed at a Trump hotel before but if all the properties that carry the Trump name have the same customer service as the one in Waikiki I will become a loyal customer from now on.","Date of stay: June 2014","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We have been going to Hawaii every other year for the past decades and have tried many different hotels in Waikiki.  We must admit, this is absolutely the best place to stay in Honolulu.  When you arrive (by car) you are immediately greeted at the valet area on the ground floor and escorted to the lobby (6th floor) where everything is taken care of.  The room we got on the 33rd floor - rm 3301 (2 bd suite) had a fantastic view of Waikiki Beach, the lagoon area of Hilton, and Kalakuau area.  In my opinion, the best view possible.  A little bonus, on Friday evening (and I think Tuesday also), just pull up a chair at the balcony and get the best view of the fireworks display at Hilton without being there.  The location at Trump is a couple of blocks away from the hustle and bustle of Kalakaua Rd itself, so you get a little peace and quiet.  Plus there is a park across the street which gives you a nice contrast to the concrete building littering Waikiki.

The room was spacious and comfortable.  There is a fully stocked kitchen (Wolf appliance!!), washer-dryer which was helpful as we just came in from Lanai, 2 full luxuriously decorated bathroom, DVD player and a Wii for the kids (to keep them occupied at night as we are winding down).  Twice a day housekeeping service with telepathy (they seem to know when we were leaving, clean up the rooms, and completed by the time we return from breakfast or dinner).  The room was spotless, credit to the housekeeping team.

We did not enjoy any of the restaurants in the hotel since we made plans at our regular hang out places, but next time, we will make it a point to try it.  Room service for breakfast was very good.  Plenty of fully ripened tropical fruits and good pastries.  (We found a local fruit store just downstairs on Beachwalk Blvd that sold pre-cut fresh fruits for a fraction of the price....I think its called Henry's Place...).

Any negatives at all?  Well, the pool is a little on the small side on the 6th floor (we skipped it).  The master bedroom shower had no doors (minor irritation), the valet area can get congested during checkout/dinner time (but wait time was no more than 5 minutes or so - enough time for them to unload luggages mainly from airport shuttles and buses), and phone system that had to be reset twice (second time, we just unplugged the phone and replugged it after 30 seconds - no big deal).  All these inconveniences and very minor.

Therefore, without hesitation, the absolute best place I've stayed in Hawaii.  Fantastic guest services.  The price can be a little expensive, but there is always some good deals so check on the Trump website.  We were able to change our reservation 2X as better packages and deals became available.  We finally got the room at a price that was quite reasonable.  It does cost a little more than the surrounding condo/hotels (ie 2 bedrooms, full kitchen full service), but nothing in its price range (or any price range) can beat the combination of service, location, convenience, and comfort (including The Halekulani).  In the end, if its a memorable stay, then its worth it.","Date of stay: June 2014","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

If going to the beach you collect your complimentary beach bag with towels, water and snacks from concierge.
The restaurant on the lobby level had tasty dishes which changed at lunch and dinner, good cocktails and was about the price of other restaurants around town. Easy walk to beach, Waikiki shopping, restaurants and nightlife. Do the beach walk up past all the beachfront hotels. You can stop for a drink in any of their beachfront bars.

It was my 20th wedding anniversary and they not only gave us an upgrade to the huge one bedroom suite overlooking Pacific Ocean but also a voucher for a bottle of champagne in the suite.  

At first I was concerned about not being on the beach but very quickly I realized that you do not want to hang out in Waikiki beach.  We drove every day to other beautiful beaches such as SAndy beach or Turtle Bay with the beach bag they provided, and the help of concierge and very courteous bell staff.  Thank God we decided to rent a car. 

We only ate breakfast there and it was adequate.  I was most impressed by complimentary champagne they provided.  When I turned in the voucher to the bar staff, I was fully expecting a bottle of cava of some sort, and surprise, they brought out Tattinger.  Trump did it with style. 

I was not impressed with the pool (although beautiful, it was very small, I would think twice about staying here if I had little children), spa or workout facility.  The decor is not as luxurious as other Trump properties that I stayed before (New York and Chicago).  It was not a grand resort filled with all kinds of things to do but more intimate and quiet place to base your vacation on and that's just what I needed.    

What this hotel stands out is in ""service"".  They did something well with the staff.  Everyone that I encountered in the hotel was courteous, pleasant, and willing to help as much as possible.  I found new respect for the Trump brand.

Nom Nom Nom.  The service was outstanding.  The food was fantastic.  The location is good too, for the most part...  by that I mean its perfect for walking around Waikiki.  The beach is just across the street, one of the better ABC stores on Lewers, love the shops on Lewers and Beach Walk, however... that comes with a price and that price is no self-parking!  Its valet ONLY which really twists my pretzel.  I like to come and go throughout the day which means you have to constantly make sure you have tip $$ on you and that adds up fast too.

We have stayed in a number of hotels and this is definitely the best by far. We arrived early and our room was not ready. Our car and baggage were taken care of, and we were offered the beach bags right away. The leis for the five of us, our 3 grown children came along, was a nice touch. We were called while on the beach that our room was ready. We were upgraded and it was a really nice room. My wife and I were celebrating our 30th anniversary which we had mentioned in the pre registration form we filled out a few days before. A nice flower arrangement, accompanied with chocolate and a voucher for a bottle of sparking wine was delivered as well as a gift from the spa. It was very unexpected but a lovely surprise. All off the staff we encountered were brilliant but special thanks to Dean, Julie, Amber and Fusae for going that extra mile to really make it even better.

The room was immaculate every day. The bed was so comfortable; it felt like sleeping on clouds.. The WiFi was great. The elevator experience was great. The newspaper on the door, the welcoming sounds of Hawaiian music in the evening when we entered the room. The breakfast experience was great. The Infinity pool was a highlight as well. Although a small pool and kind of hard to get sun depending which side you choose, the views were amazing. I loved every minute of my stay there. I was surprised to read in fine print in one of the hotel's brochure that the hotel is not actually owned or build by Trump. It operates as a franchise however, it withheld the Trump standards without a doubt. Location of the hotel is fantastic, just walking distance to the beach if you want to go for a walk; in the heart of shops, restaurants, etc. The beach bags exceeded my expectations and they came in very handy and the umbrella service was fantastic.

He doesn't own it, but licensed his name to the property and if the license is terminated the name Trump must be removed. Perhaps that is why they didn't go for the gold tower with TRUMP emblazoned on the top.

Spent 4 nights at the Trump International in Waikiki and had bed bugs on the first night there. Woke up in the morning with bites on my arms and legs and my husband had bites too but not as many as me. I believe that they are bed bugs because the bites were in a line. We told the reception about it and they had the housekeeping to come and check and they could not find anything. But then bed bugs can't be seen with naked eyes. I don't know if it's because the hotel is pet friendly. They eventually changed the room to a higher level with better view. 
Excluding this incident, I can't vouch enough for the friendliness and the service that the hotel provides. They even provide a beach bag packed with water bottles, sunscreen, towels and fruits. The room is spacious with a kitchenette. The bathroom has a huge bath tub and also a shower. As for the pool it is not huge but long enough to do laps. It is a 2 min walk to Waikiki beach and to the mall. Great hotel, amazing service.

Our room was ready within hours and our suite was just amazing, with unobstructed ocean views, full kitchen, huge marble bath and very handy laundry with washer and dryer. The little extras like the truffles and Hawaiian cookies were also appreciated. Wherever we went in the resort the staff were amazing and went out of their way to help us.

We opened the door to our room and we were in awe....we had a gorgeous living room , a seperate den area  with sofa bed, the kitchen had built in oven and convection oven, stovetop stove, wine cooler fridge and everything that you could imagine in a fully equipped kitchen. We had 2 balconies with lounge furniture on them so we could watch the fireworks on the Friday night from our balcony over the ocean from Hilton . Our bathroom had 2 showers, whirlpool, lighted makeup mirror, beautiful spa amenities and ribbon wrapped around our Toilet paper. It was our anniversary so a nice card and some Hawaiian shortbread cookies were waiting for us to enjoy! The service was spectacular and the staff were so kind and full of Aloha greetings and smiles. We did not get to enjoy the pool as we were a bit tired coming on 2 time changes from the East on Ontario but it looked beautiful. It was about a 5 minute walk across the street and at the Concierge they give you a beach bag(insulated) fruit, water, and a beach towel to take with you to enjoy the beach along the grounds of Hilton Hawaiian Village. I know this is a bit pricier than most hotels but after this experience we will NEVER stay anywhere else when we return to Hawaii...

Slight hiccup at check-in but recovery was supreme.  Cant speak highly enough of the driveway attendants and the concierge in the downstairs foyer.  

Deluxe partial ocean view studio was perfect for the two of us.  We normally book a suite but we didn't need it in this case, the room was huge.  Tastefully modern, awesome bathroom and the kitchenette provides perfectly for breakfast and snacks- we would rather go out for other meals.  The room was very clean and showed no signs of wear and tear. 

The buffet was ok but with the kitchenette we preferred to eat in our room.  The bar was terrific at night with live music and hands down the best mocktail I have ever had by the pool with basil and strawberries! 

I was surprised by the pool.  Big enough, always has 2 beds together and after reading reviews I thought this may not be a place for children but I noticed they supplied swim nappies and there were quite a few little ones.

They offered diapers, baby shampoo, wash, lotion, bibs, a nice crib. And for beach going they had their beach bags with water, fruits, towel, sunblock, but they also had beach umbrellas for you and a floatie for the baby. The staff was amazing! Treated you like family and were always ready to help you and made sure you were well provisioned for your outings. We spent more time at the pool than the beach because the beach area nearest the Trump was not very swim friendly. The beach near the hotel was too rocky, making it difficult to even swim out to get past the rocks. More swim friendly areas were a short distance away but we didn't want to make the trek with our little one. The pool was nice and heated. The pool attendant, Justin, is so nice!

The only con is the amount of time it takes for you to get your room. We arrived at 3pm and had to wait till 4pm  - we had flown all morning so were so tired & just wanted to shower so it was a little disappointing that we couldn't just get to our room... However in saying all that, the foyer & eateries were fantastic and it wasn't that much trouble to set and enjoy the views/atmosphere (although the bartender was loud!!!). I understand that sometimes rooms aren't ready until 'check in time' but because we were sick & had to leave at 7am the next morning it was disappointing we didn't get to spend more time in our room (overnight stopover).","Date of stay: May 2014","Trip type: Traveled with friends","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

From the moment we arrived, we were made to feel at home.  Of course, the hotel was luxurious, as one would expect of a Trump-managed property, but it is the service, that makes the hotel and stand out.  As one of several examples, the front desk staff went so far as to have chicken soup sent up to our room, unsolicited, when they learned that my wife was feeling under the weather.  As if that were not gracious enough, they checked in on her regularly to see how she was feeling!

But in the end decided to take the plunge and splurge at one of the best rated hotels in Waikiki.  

Being close to the beach was definitely plus, but being able to navigate around the strip was really important too.  We didn't have access to a car everyday so being able to walk and shop was great.  I was traveling with three of my sisters, my brother-in-law and my two nieces during our six day stay. 

A few days leading up to our trip I received a couple of emails providing excursions, dining suggestions and a other services provided by the Trump.  What I liked best was the pillow menu where we could select the pillows we wanted - never have I ever had this option at the hotels I've stayed at before.  

The day we arrived we were greeted by a bunch of friendly hotel staff as we pulled up in our taxi.  We were each given a lovely shell leis and our bags were quickly tagged and wheeled off by the staff.  Next stop was to the Lobby to check in.   We decided on the deluxe partial ocean view studio.  Three of us to a room.  We were given RM 1912.  

A nice box of Hawaiian goodies greeted us as we walked in. Luggage arrived shortly after.  Our studio was equipped with a king bed and a queen pull-out, flat screen tv, dvd player, kitchenette , in our bathroom: double vanity sinks, big soaker tub and open shower.  

I am going to include now the pros and cons in point form.

PROS:
-location
-friendly/very courteous staff
-wifi
-pillow selection
-beach towel/sunscreen/water/fruit provided upon request
-pool area (not huge, but sufficient)
-kitchenette 
(didn't do any cooking, but was able to use utensils, bowls, kettle to boil water for coffee and tea.  Having a microwave, toaster, fridge/freezer was a plus too, as we had gone to Walmart to buy the essentials to make breakfast)

CONS:

1)  requested for closer room to the other party we were travelling with, but they were on the opposite side of the elevators (they were left of the set of elevators down the end of the hallway, we were on the right)
2)  requested room away from elevator, but room was just separated by a storage room/housekeeping room.
3)  limited storage space (three girls to a room... did not have enough drawer space. had to leave our suitcases lying on the floor to hold items we couldn't put away)
4)  closet space quite small. 
5)  lanai was nice, but only had two chairs...there were three of us.
6)  stocking of bathroom amenities were not consistent.  Had a tub, but no bath salts, loofah.  
I had to call or ask housekeeping staff for it.  Things would magically appear ie, body butter, sugar scrub, which we didn't have before at check in.  Sometimes we would get more of one thing and not enough of the other.  

**would've been nice to have had the complete set of bath products well stocked and complete for each person so no one is left out.

Overall, we had a very nice stay at the Trump.  Door/Valet/concierge/housekeeping staff were superb, they were so nice!   Oh...I should mention the Wai'olu lounge.  Had a late dinner there one night.  food was superb, waiter was awesome too!  In-house musician was great.  

Other than the small suggestion to have housekeeping be a little more meticulous in keeping bath items well stocked.   We much enjoyed our time spent here.  We would stay again in a heartbeat!","Date of stay: April 2014","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

This hotel is a bit on the expensive side for us, but we really wanted to make her celebration special. As soon as we arrived I got the feeling that we had made the right decision about choosing this hotel, and things just got better and better. When we arrived, we were greated by name and were presented with beautiful shell leis. Our luggage was taken care of before we even had time to ask for it and we were escorted to the reception area where we were given cool towels to freshen up hands and faces. We also got ice cold scented water. What a difference from standing in line, waiting to check in! Beforehand, we had asked for a room high up in the building (for the view and to get away from the noise of the streets) on the Fort DeRussy side of the hotel. Our wishes were perfectly fulfilled and we can recommend the 31st floor to anyone who whould like a nice sea view. The lady in the reception also wished our mother a happy birthday, a very nice touch. She offered to give us a full tour of the hotel, but as it was late at night and we had travelled for >24 hrs, we preferred to get up to the room quickly. When we arrived in our room, we were surprised to see a beautiful chocolate cake and a happy birthday card. We also recived a box of Honolulu cookies in a cute box. A little while after we had reached the room, the lady in the reception telephoned to check if the room was alright. She was so nice to us! We had a 2 bedroom suite with two lanais and a corner balcony. The suite was huge! We almost got lost! Everything was perfectly clean and seemed quite new. The bathrooms were equipped with ""The Spa at Trump"" amenities which were replenished every day. Using the sugar scrub and the body butter after a long day's sightseeing and hiking was pure luxury. We had masses of towels and lovely bathrobes (we bought bathrobes to take home, to keep some of the Trump feeling). We used the kitchen alot. It contained everything imaginabile (more things than my kichen at home). For us, having a kitchen on vacation means freedom. You don't need to make dinner reservations every night, and if you are delayed, the kitchen is there waiting for you, unlike your dinner table at a restaurant. The kitchen had stove, oven, microwave, rice cooker, water kettle, coffee maker (coffee and tea were replenished twice a day), dishwasher, fridge, freezer, glasses (both real glass and plastic for kids or outings), cutlery, plates of every size and lots more. We even baked our own muffins in the muffin tray! The suite had a proper dinner table with space for 6 persons (so many hotel rooms, even those with kitchen, have not). The beds were very comfortable. We also had our own washer and dryer, a real help when you are staying for two weeks. That washer and dryer enabled our family to travel with hand luggage only and avoided getting the vacation ruined by lost luggage. So, the suite as perfect in every way, but the best thing about staying at the Trump was the staff. Everyone was curteous, helpful and really seemed to care about making our stay enjoyable. The housekeeping staff always helped out if we needed extra coffee and went through a lot of trouble to get us a new glass bowl when we had happened to break one (for all the world, you would have thought it was their fault it was broken, which it was not). The people at Attache really were angels. We requested 3 travel fit kits to our room (shoes, shorts, sports bra, t-shirt and yoga mat), and everything we needed was different sizes. They didn't only find the right things for us, but did it in an instant. Those travel fit kits really saved the day when we hiked up Koko head. It is a steep climb, and without workout gear, I think we would have melted. The doormen were forever helpful. They found us taxis at all hours, got us water when we were leaving for an outing and were always ready with a joke and a smile. Everytime we got back, they greated us and asked us about our day! The concierge service at ground floor was always ready to give us towels, bottled water, fruit and sunscreen whenever we went to the beach. When we returned to the hotel, we just handed back the bag with used towels and got a new one next time. It was so convenient never having to buy heavy water bottles. When I asked them about the way, they didn't only tell me where to go, but got out a map, drew the most convenient route and made sure I knew what direction I was going before leaving me. One day when we got back to our room, we found a box of truffles waiting för us on the counter. That kind of surprises makes your day! We never visited the spa, so I can't review that, but we visited the pool area quite often. No, the pool isn't huge, but it is very beautiful. We were always there in the morning or late at night, so it was never crowded. It consisted of a rectangular pool with comfortable water temperature, perhaps best fitted for swimming, and a smaller, hotter bubble pool. There were sun loungers by the pool, water and some magazines. The pool was flanked by greenery on one side, and on the other side you could glimpse the sea. We also visited the library to print boarding passes. There was two computers with a printer already stocked with paper and working at the first attempt (up til now, I never knew a working hotel printer). We also visited the gym which had all the usual gear. The location of the hotel is very close to the beach, we never felt inconvenienced by it not being a beachfront property. You can walk to the beach in 2 minutes and that is to the nicest part of Waikiki beach in my opinion. We could usually sit under a tree in the Fort DeRussy park. By doing so, we avoided direct sunlight during daytime and didn't get sand in all our bags, clothes etc. This part of Waikiki beach is less crowded and you have more room to spread out. All in all, the best hotel stay we've had so far. The attention to detail and the will to make your stay perfect really matters, and the Trump knows how it is done! Thank you for your kindness, we will be back!","Date of stay: April 2014","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

From the minute you arrive to the minute you leave, front desk, Attache, room service, maids, everyone was amazing. We stayed 6 nights and did not encounter one staff member at the Trump who was polite and offer a service beyond what was expected. 
We had a 2 Bedroom ocean front and wow, what a view. We made sure we were in the room every night to watch the sunset. The ocean front is definitely worth the money. 
This was our second visit to the Trump Waikiki and we will definitely be back. In fact, we will endeavor to stay at any Trump hotels we come across.

Stay. Ever.","My family had 3 and a half days in Hawaii and decided to splurge by booking the Trump's Diamond Head Penthouse. We just had stayed at an amazing hotel in Vegas, but this was really in a class of its own.

POSITIVES
- Before arriving I requested an extra pull out bed. They measured the room, made sure it fit, installed it before we arrived (even though we checked in early) and provided it free of cost.
- So the penthouse is one of those modern interior design situations where the bathrooms are all glass, and so the toilets/showers can be seen from the bedroom. I sent an email to the staff requesting if they had anything to help with privacy, within a few hours they had measured the walls, gone out, purchased and installed curtains to meet our request. Amazing level of service.
- Great ceiling heights and floor to ceiling windows
- The views from this room are insane. I have attached some pictures of these. You can see both sunrise and sunset.
- Had a bunch of goodies upon check in. Some insane chocolate chip cookies that I really shouldn't of finished but I did.
- Room service was incredibly quick, and was tasty (at least for the two times we ordered something small)
- I think they scour the island to find the friendliest check in, concierge and entrance staff. Always extremely hospitable and willing to strike up a conversation.
- Our flight arrived at 5am and checkin was only at 2pm, but they graciously allowed us to check in early (luckily our room hadn't been booked the night before), which was a massive relief after an uncomfortable overnight flight. Also upon checkin someone comes and gives you wet towelettes to freshen up (which was very nice!)
- The robes ... honestly the best robes I have ever experienced.
- Trump spa was also amazing. They were booked out when I tried to have a walk-in appointment, so need to book in advance (which is normal).
- There is a rooftop hot tub with crazy views across Honolulu. Very easy to operate (water was always warm). Attached some photos of this as well.
- Internet was free and worked well
- Bathroom supplies were amazing and all branded from the Trump Spa (I took some of the scrub and body butter home =p)
- Washer and dryer in the room which is useful
- Some great restaurants and shops within walking distance (as well as the beach). Try Roy's for dinner one day, was amazing food!

NEGATIVES (Nothing major / within the staff's control)
- I wasn't a huge fan of the buffet breakfast at the In-Yo cafe. Pretty standard buffet for what is charged. Recommend trying to find somewhere else. We had 1 breakfast on a food tour, 2 at the Trump, and one down the road at another place which was just average, so unfortunately don't have a recommendations.
- Can get pretty windy outside (I think we were there at an especially bad time as the deck furniture of one of our neighbours nearly blew off the roof, so they had to come and secure ours). But just be aware of this if you plan to spend most of your time on the roof/deck or host an event for some reason (we were happily indoors for most of the time except when using the hot tub).
- The hotel transfer the attache tried to organise for us was very expensive ($165 for a sedan to $215 for a limo). If you google for cheap transfers you can find a van for a fixed fee of $35 (so we used that instead).
- The storage space is a little small in the room, so you will most likely end up having suitcases that can't fit in the wardrobes (.... we are shopaholics so this was probably inevitable anyway)

Also it's not a positive or a negative, but just an expectation setting. There are about 5 or 6 other penthouse apartments on this floor (I think maybe owned by private individuals, none of whom seemed to be there during our stay). This particular room faces towards the city/mountains (you can see the sea from both sides of the apartment, but its not directly facing it). The view is equally breathtaking (of the Ko‘olau mountains / city), but don't expect to be facing the beach directly.

Overall I am really happy that I had the chance to experience Honolulu from the Trump penthouse. It really feels like you are sitting on top of the city and it's a great vantage point to explore the city. Good luck with your booking choice!

We arrived after a 10 hour flight overnight and had not had any sleep - the staff quickly got our room ready 4 hours early, & provided us with a room upgrade.  
The room was comfortable, relaxing, and had a beautiful view off the balcony.  Our towels were changed daily & we were given new bath amenities each day.  The room had a beautiful big bathtub and overall was very modern.

I have read other reviews about the pool being too small - I thought the pool was amazing!  Plenty of deck chairs to lay by the pool and amazing views from the pool deck and from in the pool.  
The Ocean View bar has a fantastic atmosphere & is great at happy hour & for tapas food!

The beach is a 2 minute walk and the lovely staff at Trump provide packed bags with towels, suncream, fruit and water to take to the beach - this was a fantastic service.

Finally, the staff were so friendly and helpful.  From arriving at Trump to departing we were extremely pleased with the assistance we received and we wish we were back there right now!!

Cannot ask for anything more.","Those travelling with kids understand how there is very small margin for error in selecting ideal hotel accommodations.  My wife and I travel to Hawaii frequently and our most recent trip included our 5-year old and a 1-year old.  This was our first stay at the Trump Waikiki and will definitely not be our last as we were quite pleasantly surprised.  We've stayed in other hotels in the area on previous trips and were never quite 100% satisfied in particular as kids carry unique needs.  After a very positive experience this past week, I have to admit you really need to reach to find anything to complain about.

Before arriving we received several emails advising of services available as well as a pre-check-in option to select specific requirements (i.e. groceries, type of pillows, excursions, etc).  The hotel is located right in the heart of the Waikiki strip and is centrally located.  Most importantly it is across the street from beach access.  When we arrived we were greeted by a hostess and escorted to the lobby one floor up where we were again greeted by hostesses offering wet towels and drinks.  Check-in was very fast and simple.  We were escorted to our room where our bags were already waiting.  After a long stressful plane ride with 2 young ones, it was very nice to get unloaded and settled into our room so efficiently.  

Our first impression of the room was a collective grin on our faces.  Right away you admire how clean, modern, and spacious the suite is.  We ordered a partial ocean view 1-bedroom suite however the view from our room (#1922) was essentially unencumbered wraparound with clear views of the ocean.  Gourmet kitchen was fully stocked and equipped to address all our kids' eating needs.  It was my wife's birthday so a freshly chilled chocolate cake was awaiting on the counter with a nice birthday greeting card.  They thought of everything for our kids - bottle warmer, kids robe + slippers, step stool for sink, diaper genie, etc).  The bathroom is large with double sinks and a large soaker tub (an open shower area that is not enclosed).  Wi-fi was free but bandwidth a little weak.  2 LCD TVs that featured open HDMI slots so I was easily able to connect my MacBook for the kids to watch their stored movies.  

The bedroom is a bit tight as most of it is taken up by the king bed.  We did not request a full-size crib and managed to squeeze a smaller wooden crib in next to the bed.  Our older daughter slept with us in the large bed rather than outside on the pull-out sofa.  We switched to contoured pillows free of charge as the synthetic pillows were a bit flat for our liking.  Our biggest complaint would be the lack of storage space.  There is one dresser in the bedroom with only 4 full drawers and then the closet.  For a family of 4 staying for 1 week, you will be living out of some suitcases.  Washer and dryer is a small condo-sized version that did an adequate job and simply required more frequent cycles.  Noise levels were fairly good but cannot be avoided altogether given the location of the building (i.e. we did not have any challenges falling asleep).

The staff throughout the hotel was extremely helpful and friendly - you could not pass a hotel staff member without a smile and an ""aloha"".  Our room was serviced twice a day so always well stocked.  The gym is a bit tight but contained all the essentials including treadmills, ellipticals, dumbbells to max 55 lbs + 2 machines (chest + shoulder press), and drinks.  We did not find there to be a lot of kid activities but could be because we did not ask or seek them out.  I read some complaints about the small infinity pool - honestly for 2 younger kids and unless you are looking to swim laps, we found the pool area relaxing and refreshingly quiet (probably because it is not big enough for diving, beach balls, etc).  We did not get a chance to dine in the hotels' restaurants opting for some more economical local alternatives and/or simply cooking meals on our own.

All-said, the Trump was one of the best accommodations we have experienced anywhere and worthy of the accolades it receives.  It is not the cheapest option but you definitely get your money's worth if you are a demanding traveller as we are and concerned about your kids' needs as well.  We will not be staying anywhere else on future visits and would highly recommend for any of our friends and families.","Date of stay: April 2014","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

From the first call to book our vacation, to the follow up with us before we arrived, to the attention to detail... it was all very impressive. And consistent... our stay was met with the same kind of personal, special service from the moment we drove up to the front entrance . Attache and concierge services were superb and when they didn't get it quite right, they immediately fixed things. The lobby tapas lounge serves wonderfully prepared food with great service . We made sure we went back before we checked out, for the best kona coffee we sampled anywhere. We did not want the crowds of beachfront hotels particularly just before Xmas and yet the Trump hotel is just a short walk away and they send you off with a beach bag of fruit, water and suntan lotion. We were upgraded from a 2 bedroom to a 3 bedroom suite, likely because we were celebrating an anniversary and it was much appreciated as we ended up on the 31 floor with a sensational view. The room needed some attention... phone not working properly, washer /dryer/dishwasher needing some tweeking but it was all taken care of promptly. And speaking of prompt, when we out for dinner one night, the crown on one of my teeth came off.  We walked back to the Trump , spoke with the concierge and I was in a dentist's chair at 9 a.m. the next morning.

If you want a five star experience then this is the hotel to stay at. I applaud all the employees of this hotel.  

We stayed in room 1402 from 14-22 April. The room was large, bright, airy and exceptionally clean and housekeeping saw to it that it stayed that way twice daily. You will feel pampered at this hotel, and your every request will be catered for, with genuine pleasure.

Welcome gifts of cookies arrive for you once you've settled in (we were welcomed into our room at 8:00 am free of charge! After a long overnight flight it was bliss).
Throughout the week further gifts were left for us (truffles, chocolates etc) with messages from the hotel saying that they hoped we were enjoying our stay.

Choose your type of mattress (firm, soft, medium etc), choose your pillow type from their pillow menu and you will have the soundest of sleeps. Noise blockout windows and doors and well insulated walls will ensure you never hear your neighbors. Choose your new release movie of a night (prices range between $10-17) and enjoy it on their comfortable couch or sofa bed (which the nightly turn down service prepares for you).

The pool whilst on the small size is still perfect. The view is out to the beach through palm trees, the loungers always available with the poolside attendants preparing it for you with your own slipcover and towels (no tacky towel cards required here!!) and your lunch and cocktail menu awaits. You do not have to lift a finger. You don't even need to bring sunscreen or water, they have that for you as well.

Common areas are beautifully maintained. The gym was one of the cleanest I've ever been too. Antibacterial wipes, towels and water provided there as well.

If you are reading this and have not yet understood that this hotel spoils and pampers you, then I assure you this is exactly what it does.
Whatever it costs for the type of room or suite you have chosen (we were in a one bedroom apartment with a full kitchen) I cannot stress enough that you will not be disappointed. In fact it has set my expectations so high that I'm afraid no other hotel I stay in, in other parts of the world will quite match up to it!

This was my second time to Waikiki. I love the vibe, the shopping, the food, the views and beaches. I just wish that I had stayed at the Trump the first time. When I return again and again there is no doubt whatsoever that the Trump is the only hotel u will stay at.

Thank you to all staff for my wonderful stay at your remarkable hotel!","Date of stay: April 2014","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We could sit on our couch and view sunrises and sunsets for five days We were sent flowers and fruit on our arrival, I had a minor health issue and the consierge sent up ice immediately.

Our family of three had a two bedroom suite overlooking the beach.  Check in was nice, they whisked us up to our room quickly.  Our initial overall impressions of the room were fine, two bedrooms and bathrooms, great large windows.  The main sitting area was comfortable, there was also a smaller sitting area, that would have been better as a small office or a different type of space.  The rooms seemed a little worn, like the hotel is ready for a refresh, the carpets didn't seem fresh, pulling up from where they meet the tile.  Even with the large windows, the room has a dark feeling to it.  They are on odd configuration and I'm not sure if that can be remedied without a major gut remodel.  Having stayed at other Trump properties, this location had a more generic feel.  

The breakfast and bar areas of the hotel were comfortable,  the pool area is too small.  There was no attendant to clean up after guests had left, so it was a guessing game if chairs were used or not.  

All in all, we would stay again.  Service was good, the extra space was nice, but nothing that stood out as spectacular.  I would recommend the hotel to families who need two bedroom suites and who are looking for a good location near Waikiki Beach,","Date of stay: March 2014","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

We stayed at a different location for the first 5 nights before heading to Las Vegas to see Elton John, then returned to have some relaxation and Hawaiian hospitality before returning home.  It was a fabulous way to complete the holiday, with everything from the genuine friendliness of each and every staff member we encountered, to the standard of accomodation, and facilities of the establishment. After so many people had stated in their reviews they had received upgrades, we were hopeful but not fortunate to have one, but nonetheless happy with out room. The daily beach bags were a nice touch, the twice daily housekeeping, and good quality toiletries and linen/towels added to the experience - to me it's these small things that count towards a hotel being one that is good, and one that is great. We didn't use the cooking facilities of the well appointed kitchenette, but was great to have cutlery and crockery to use for breakfast which we ate most days on the lanai. The bed would have to have been the most comfortable I have ever slept on - was like floating on a cloud without being too soft.  Standout features for us were the acknowledgement that it was our anniversary the month we were there (from the details provided on joining the Trump card) with the complimentary box of cookies and bottle of bubbly, and the way the staff on the concierge desk handled the an issue when a tour booking went wrong. They went over and above what we would have expected them to do to manage the situation - well done ladies! We were concerned about the pool following previous reviews in regard to size but actually didn't find it as bad as expected, could always get a sun lounge and were appreciative that some parents were mindful of keeping their children in one section of the pool so that there was an area that child-free holidaymakers could plunge in peace. Poolside food service was reasonably priced and good quality. Only patronised the Wai'olo Lounge once, and there was a wedding on that evening, but were accommodated in the foyer area adjacent - food was fabulous.  Great location in regard to proximity to Lewers St for restaurants and a quieter part of town.

The hotel itself is located within walking distance to the beach and Kalakaua Ave, where they have lots of shopping and restaurants. I thought valet parking was pretty pricey, but I don't know how much other hotels in area charge.

The room itself was immaculate and spacious with a separate living room, dining room, kitchen, and a balcony with wonderful views. Room also had a washer/dryer, which was really convenient for after the beach, and they also provide bottled water for the length of your stay.

We booked a ocean studio but with the Trump card program we were upgraded to a 1 bed + Den Ocean view suite which was outstanding. The apartment was super clean and the bed was very comfortable. The room had great ocean views and we also got a spectacular fireworks view on Friday night from our balcony. Loved the clean new look and didn't hear any other guests whilst in our room. Trump is a little bit out of the middle of Waikiki which suited us as we like it a bit quieter and it's only a 5 to 10 min walk to anything you need. WIFI worked perfectly the whole time we were there and the pool was more than enough for us. The beach is only a short walk away and everyday concierge will give you a beach bag with towels, sunscreen & fruit .Our daughter became sick in the middle of the night so we called front desk and they said it would be best to go to hospital and they had a taxi waiting for us when we got downstairs. I can't thank the staff enough on how caring they were as they followed up the next day with a phone call and a lady came to our room with a surprise for our daughter that cheered her up. 
Just one small thing I can think of is that they could do with an air dryer in the room for clothes. I had just bought a $70 shirt in Waikiki and didn't want it in the dryer so I put it over the chair on balcony and ended up with a huge stain across the back and it was completely ruined. 
Yes you could stay somewhere closer to the beach but you can't beat Trump for service & cleanliness.","Date of stay: April 2014","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We normally don't pay this much for a room, but, I'm so glad we did - it was so worth it!  There were 4 adults in our party and they upgraded us from a one bedroom with a den to a two bedroom - what an awesome way to start!  The staff was great - right from the start to the very end.  We didn't have any children in our group - so the pool was not an issue for us, in fact, we enjoyed the smaller pool - not so busy and noisy - very relaxing.  We went to the WaiOlu bar which is on the 6th floor behind the registration desk, and the bartenders really made us feel welcome - they gave us good information about what to see in the area - they were pleasant and fun to visit with - great staff!!   The housekeeping service was also great - it was so nice to have our refrigerator filled with bottled water when we got back to the room.

We have stayed in Sheraton Waikiki and Royal Sheraton previously but chose Trump this time based on the good reviews.  What a disappointment!  The staff is friendly and courteous.  However, the hotel pool and the luxury beach service are both like jokes.  The pool is extremely small and was jammed with kids of all ages.  There is no beach service apart of supplying a beach bag with towels, sun screen and a bag of an apple and an orange.  You need to walk for a block to the beach and there is a guy on the beach who has a contract with Trump from whom you can rent chairs and umbrellas for $15/hour fee.  I forgot my reading glasses at the hotel after we checked out.  Fortunately the housekeeping found them and the hotel was gladly to send it back to me as long as I pay for the shipping charges.   Now,  Trump Hotel management, here is something you can learn from other luxury hotel with good service: When my husband left his tie in the room at the Peninsula Chicago, not only the hotel mailed the tie back, it was dry cleaned and pressed, folded nicely in a box, free of charge.  I always consider Trump a luxury hotel.

When we head to the beach, we just stop by the concierge to grab a beach bag filled with ice cold bottled water, fruits and sunscreen.  They also have sand toys for the kids.  We love how the hotel isn't trying to nickel and dime us over every bottle of water or small condiments.

Trump International did not disappoint and in fact exceeded our already high expectations in every way.
We had a room on the beach walk side, which we found very noisy in the afternoon. A quick call to the wonderful attaché service and the front desk soon had us in an ocean view room facing Saratoga Road. We didn't have to lift a finger and were soon enjoying one of the best rooms we have ever stayed in. Trump Las Vegas was another.
We stayed in and cooked breakfast every morning because nothing could compare to the view from our balcony. Needless to ay it was also the perfect place for sunset drinks.
Every staff member from front desk, concierge, housekeeping, restaurant and pool staff went out of their way to do any thing possible to help. No staff member ever went past without acknowledging us or asking how our day was.
Every feature of the room oozes high quality and every thing you can think of is supplied to make your stay more enjoyable. One day a box of the best truffles I have ever tasted, was left to thank us for making Trump, home for our holiday. 
The location is second to none, with the beach across the road, the restaurants of Beach Walk around the corner and all the retail shops a short stroll away.

Their happy hour is great and the bartenders are friendly and go out of the way to make you feel welcome. One night we came back just before they closed and my wife asked for a hot chocolate. I doubt that comes up often in Honolulu but the barman went out of his way to make her a great one with whipped cream and all. Many places would have just said- no we don't have that on the menu.
We used the spa one day during our stay and here as well the customer service was exemplary. 
Our room was a small apartment with a nice living room , full kitchen and 2 balconies from which we could see the fireworks at the nearby Hilton on Friday and watch the sunsets each night. Everything in the room was clean and in good working order. 
The Breakfast buffet is a bit expensive but that's par for Hawaii and the food and service there were equally first rate.
The valet parking guys also deserve mention because they were always quick and efficient whenever we needed to get our car and greeted us warmly whenever we returned.

Is it because a hotel like this (as in expensive) attracts people in a certain socio-economic class? - I think so.  There was a fair smattering of the ""my dogs bigger than your dog"" loud people and  tight lipped haughty mutes. ... auch well.....
But to continue, we came to terms with this, and yes did enjoy our stay and should we return to Oahu, would choose to stop here again, given the very fantastic staff and location,","Date of stay: January 2014","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The rooms are spacious and have a fully-equipped high-end kitchen. 
The most oustanding point however is the absolutly perfect service: My girlfriend bought her wedding dress in Honolulu and wanted to transport it as hand luggage. One of the hotel's staff saw this and offered us a suitcase to better transport the dress. This was very attentive from her and highly appreciated. As a plus, the hotel has also a turn-down service. 
The hotel offers no self-parking possibility. The cost for valet parking is USD 33 per night. Just on the other side of the street is a big public parking, but the prices are not much lower there.","Date of stay: March 2014","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

A huge bathroom with full bath, luxurious toiletries and fluffy white towls.
A selection of pillow styles and lighter weight blankets available and promptly delivered.
A reasonable size balcony for breakfast and to enjoy the sea view, watch the sunset and Friday night fireworks.

We've previously gone to Maui, Kauai, and the Big Island.  We thought that this urban retreat might be a fun change.

Having selected this hotel from TripAdvisor reviewers like you set our expectations pretty high.  Everything we read about his place is pretty accurate so I won't repeat it.  Let me tell you about some of the things that really set this place apart from the competition and some things we didn't expect.  From the second you arrive you are greeted at the driveway with a  warm welcome with a sense of urgency and high energy.  Upstairs on the 5th floor lobby, the check in is serene and calm but highly efficient.  Things I loved:  the big room and bathroom, the quietness, the frequent housekeeping, great security, free wifi and tasteful décor. Not to mention the huge fluffy towels and large bottles of shampoo and large bars of soap.   The refrigerator had a super cold freezer so we could buy our favorite ice cream treats at the ABC store down the street and bring it back.  All the bottled water you needed at no charge.  Loved the way the phone was answered before the first ring finished and how I never waited in line for service.  Anytime you entered a public space with a puzzled look on your face, someone was there asking if you needed help.  The beach bags were great.  Some folks complain about the lack of a large outdoor pool.  Well, for us not having the big resort pool meant not having to deal with tons of folks fighting over some lounge chairs with towels with lots of kids running noisily around.  The long infinity pool is really beautiful and peaceful, lots of roomy comfy loungers and our two daughters loved it.  Easy walk to the beach and we did it often.  Thought the breakfast buffet at In-Yo was pricey at $33 for adults ($25 if you pre buy it) and $16 for kids ($13 if you pre buy it) but after the first time, it was so nice we went back again.  Beautiful layout of freshness and lots of selection.   Check out my pictures.

Things that might have been a bit disappointing:  the sofa pull out bed wasn't that comfortable, you could feel the springs.  For kids it's fine if they are light because the springs wouldn't be felt through the bedding and mattress but it might be uncomfortable for an adult.  Drawers are a bit small but lots of closet space.  could use some more towel racks or hooks in the bathroom.

But it was the hundreds of other details that we appreciated and voted the best Hawaiian experience by our entire family.  We'll most likely return here next year.","Date of stay: February 2014","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The Trump has everything you need for a Hawaiian vacation and more.  I’d bet my Tripadvisor reviewer reputation that you’ll be as happy as we were.

I travel throughout the year and have the opportunity to stay in 1-2 hotels a week, at the minimum.  I’ve stayed at everything from Best Western to Four Seasons and look very much forward to sharing my balanced review of the Trump Waikiki.  They say you can’t be all things to all people, but somehow the Trump managed to pull this off.  

For travelling families:
My wife and I have a 3-month old and this was his first vacation.  We were looking for a place we wouldn’t be nickeled-and-dimed and would be family friendly.  Ivanka Trump did a fantastic job creating a Trump kids program that provides everything for the travelling family.  Oh, did I mention it’s all complimentary as well?  I’m talking about a solid wooden crib, bottle sterilizers, baby shampoo, diaper pail, diapers, etc.  If you look around your baby nursery or kid’s room, I’m sure they have it available at the Trump if you forgot it.

For couples without kids:
The rooms are huge and very private.  We stayed on the 20th floor with an amazing ocean view.  We didn’t hear ANY of our neighbors, but always managed to see them in the hallway.  This told me the hotel was built solid.  

For single folks:
One of the best aspects about this hotel is the appeal to the vibrant nightlife.  They have several events throughout the month from Happy Hours, to black tie parties, making it easy to meet people.  Even with a kid, we met so many people as we lounged at the pool or any of the restaurants in the hotel.  The nightlife is vibrant and it’s super-close to other hotels/restaurants if you want to keep the party going.

The rooms:
We stayed in two different rooms during our 9 night stay.  The first room was on the 12th floor and faced the Embassy suites hotel.  The room was amazing and I’ve never felt so good laying down and sleeping in a bed before, as I did in that room.  Even with a crib and all our baby stuff, the room had ample space.  Each room in the hotel has a kitchen (galley style) which has everything you need to cook.  As a former chef in my past life, the kitchen was stocked with all the kitchen utensils to cook a five-star meal.  The bathrooms were huge and pretty much all marble.  Each bathroom has two (jack-and-jill) sinks, a large soaking tub and a strange but appealing Japanese-style shower.  I simply asked if another room with a better view bight be available and the front desk totally took care of us, moving us to the 20th floor with an amazing view of the ocean….AND THE FIREWORKS AT HILTON HAWAIIAN VILLAGE.
If you stay at the Trump, be sure to ask for a room above the 9th floor, facing the Hilton side, so you can sit on your lanai (balcony) and watch the fireworks show.

Housekeeping:
The folks will bring you everything you need from extra bottled-water to coffee creamers.  I always made sure to give them a few dollars as we called them 2-3 a day for extra stuff.  They were fast, friendly and provided flawless service.

The pool:
The pool is amazing, although it seemed small it was fantastic and we never felt crowded.  Linden, the pool manager and restaurant manager was fantastic.  As a manager, he made his rounds on the regular and we were always happy to talk with him.  Such a positive guy with the island vibe.

The restaurants:
When you check in, you arrive at valet on the 1st floor and take an elevator to the 6th floor, which is the lobby.  They have two restaurants on the 6th floor and one down on the first floor.  If you want a burger that will change your life, go to BLT and order their burger.  It’s $22, but totally worth it!  The restaurant behind the reception desk has a decent happy hour, with lots of loungy-type seating, which was fantastic.  They always managed to have the best fresh Poke (island staple) in all the hotels we’ve stayed at on the island.

Money-saving tips:
With a 3-month old, I’m always trying to find ways to save money.  Overall, we didn’t really need to go anywhere to save money, as the Trump had so much that was complimentary.  Valet was the only thing I thought was a little pricey.  In truth, they do have the best parking/valet rates in Waikiki, but I felt okay about parking my own car and saving $33/day.  While the guys down in valet do a fantastic job, you can also go across the street and park in the fort derussy parking lot for less.  If you’re staying longer than 5 nights, head across the street (from valet) to the fort derussy parking lot and the lot attendant will tell you were to buy a parking pass ($160/month) to save you money.  If you’re familiar with the area, the place to buy the parking pass is on the first floor of the Hale Koa parking garage.  It’s a 3 –story garage across the park from the fort derussy parking lot.  If you prefer to cook versus dining-out, head to the Whole Foods in Kahala to stock-up on everything you need.  If you don’t have a rental car, you can go across the street from the trump (lewers street) to the ABC store to stock-up on stuff.  The hotel has such an amazing location and close to everything

The beach:
While Trump isn’t officially on the beach, it’s a 2 minute walk (I mean 2 minutes literally) from valet to the sand.  The Trump has it’s own spot on the beach.  If you’re there, you’ll probably run into Vino.  He’s a great guy and totally hooked us up with everything we needed for a fun day in the sun.

We had four nights here in room 1101, one of the cheaper rates at the back of the building. The hotel has more of an apartment atmosphere than the other out and out hotels on Waikiki, but we actually liked this. 

The service is fantastic, the rooms modern and clean, the pool is a bit small but the space is well designed and a great place to spend an afternoon. The location is down one end of Waikiki, but it doesn't feel like you're away from the action, and it's a just a few steps to the beach. I love how they give you a beach pack with towels, sunscreen and fruit if you tell the concierge you're heading down to the beach.

Only quibble is that the lower rooms get some noise in the early hours of the morning from beeping reversing trucks in the hotel's loading dock and from the streets below. If you can afford to splash out on a room up higher and facing the beach, you can't go wrong with this hotel.","Date of stay: February 2014","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We also ate dinner at BLT Steakhouse Waikiki which is located on the ground floor of the Trump and it was very good (I wrote a separate review for that). One small caveat to staying at the Trump is that you are not right on the beach. You are, however, a short 2 min walk down the beach path to the beach. It is still a great location but some rooms are afforded a better view than others. I would stay at this hotel again and I would recommend it to my family and friends.

I may be off by one or two either way, but this was around my fiftieth time. Which brings me to the first time at the Trump International having wanted to stay here the last couple of trips in. What can I say, from the hotels I have stayed at, the Trump simply was as advertised and exactly as I had hoped for. 
We arrived early evening to be greeting with leis and quickly on our way to reception 6 floors up. The check in was swift, polished and professional. For a seven night stay and a NEW member of the Trump card, we were offered an upgrade which set the tone; originally a city without balcony reservation became a balcony and oh what a treat for seven days and nights. Just a note for budget conscious travellers; there is a $100 per day hold on your credit card for incidentals... My preference is better disclosure at time of reservation. But, at least it was disclosed at check in and naturally I expected it but something hotels have a long way to go yet what they are swiping your card for...
Back to the good stuff! Yes, the rating as having the best Mai Tai in Honolulu (or is it Hawaii) is probably on the mark. It was excellent and our first drink that night, along with fantastic appies in the lounge. 
The room was excellently laid out and beautifully appointed. Although we only did toast and coffee in the morning, the kitchen was fully stocked, top name appliances and all the flatware, plates and tools you need. 
Loved the bathroom and the open shower! Reminded me where I was every morning. 
Ate at BLT twice and once on the pool lounge during the Super Bowl. My only dislike was the less than perfect execution for setting up a Super Bowl viewing. The bar TV was locked on closed caption so we had to see the visual translation which was annoying and I'm not sure what drink specials were available (as advertised to all the rooms on a turn down sheet the night before) but none were offered. It was OK but honestly, since we're not there with anyone, and having to work the unknown of getting into a bar, we left at halftime and watched the second half from the room over drinks and the balcony door open. I'm not sure why the TV set up could not be in the lobby lounge instead. 
Departure was again excellent and efficient. No complaints from me, rather accolades and compliments.
We will both return to TRUMP on our next visit.","Date of stay: February 2014","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

It was incredible experience of comfort, luxury and freedom from all concerns. And two old ladies are not easy to satisfy, believe me! We were cooking for ourselves due to digestive problems, and kitchen was adequately equipped for a week of home-cooking. Grocery stores (not ABC!!!) were a bit far: we used Food Pantry and Walmart. My mother does not trust anybody to purchase our groceries, so we had a bit of gorgeous walking, istead of ordering it through the concierge. Beach, closest to the hotel, is not very good and bottom of the Ocean is a bit rocky,  but a very short distance towards Royal Hawaiian, beach is becoming really nice. Our plane was departing really late in the evening, so we were offered complimentary Hospitality Suite for half a day. Hotel employees quickly noticed our problem with bad memories and helped us navigate through guided tours and other appointments, though they didn't have to. Just a nice touch to come up, check my booking papers, verify that I was wrong about the date of our tour, while we were waiting for a bus at the drive-through area. And we didn't even ask for help, at least not yet. Thanks, guys and gals for looking after old ladies! Anyway, my mother is extremely spoiled now: she will not go to any other place, but back to the Waikiki Trump, even if we have to wait a little longer and match the budget.

The rooms are rarely ready upon arrival, but they let you roam nearby and call you when it is finished.  The brunch buffet is one of the best on the island for variety and freshness.  Anything from scrambled eggs to sushi, they have you covered.  The facilities are very nice, including multiple pools on-site.  

As I stated in the title, this hotel has everything but a good view of the water, but it's one of the best hotels on the island with easy access to the waterfront.","Date of stay: February 2013","Trip type: Traveled on business","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

We were staying here for our 10 year wedding anniversary and from the moment we pulled up we were treated like we were the only people they were looking after. Even before we arrived their services was fantastic we booked a few activities before arriving and picking up the confirmations and directions was a smooth process.

On arrival we were greeted with beautiful leis and sent up to reception where check in was smooth and easy we were also surprised to be offered a upgrade to a suite. In all our travelling we have never ever had an upgrade we went up to the suite and were blown away by how big it was King Bed, Lounge area Kitchen it was almost as big as our house back home. We had a view of the Ocean and the City. Awaiting were a box of Honolulu Cookie Company cookies and a note saying happy 10 year anniversary with a bottle of wine to have when ever we wanted it during our stay. The bed was super comfortable it was just like we were at home.

That night exhausted after arriving from Maui we ate at Wai'ola Lounge the food was beautiful cooked perfect. The view was beautiful took my breath away. 

During our stay there was a fire and we were woken around 12.30am to the alarm blaring and had to evacuate the building the walk down from the 18th floor was exhausting and once we were down we were told that the fire had been contained and we could return to our rooms as soon as possible as pretty much the entire hotel were in the foyer and surrounds we decided to sit back and wait to use the elevator the staff gave us a drink of water while we waited. The next morning we awoke to a letter under our door apologising for the inconvenience.

We used the pool a few times the temperature was beautiful and it was really peaceful during the times we used it.

We loved our stay here and would recommend it to everyone. Its a block back from the beach they supply you with a beach back with towels fruit water and sunscreen when every you need to use one. We were given one on our trip to Koala Ranch I thought initially unnecessary but it was insisted we take one incase we got muddy thankfully we did have it as were were covered in mud after our ATV ride of the ranch. They were also kind enough to give us children's leis for our kids even though they were back in Australia. Oh and after checkin we commented on how lovely the pens were to write with in seconds we were both given one to which I still use.

The hotel was having a special event at the pool the night we checked in and unfortunately our rooms as above the pool and it was very noisy.  I called to ask to switch rooms and they moved us to an upgraded room  and comped us one night for the inconvenience.  Great way to fix a mistake.  

Loved the beach bag service as well with anything we needed.

Upon reflection the experience started before we even arrived! We received an email asking us to complete a form to ensure the hotel was prepared to make us as comfortable as possible. In this form we were asked to supply detail of any special event - noting that it was our wedding anniversary we received complimentary champagne and chocolates in our suite.

We were upgraded to a 2 bedroom suite with extensive views of the ocean, city and mountains. The suite was equipped with a kitchen that had every imaginable item. After two weeks of travelling in the States and having restaurant meals it was great to cook a few meals ourselves and enjoy the incredible view.

Attention to detail is an understatement at Trump Waikiki. The bathrooms are stocked with everything you require including spa products that were fabulous!

Our room was was spotlessly cleaned every day and we could even nominate what time each day it would suit us for this service to be completed!

Another amazing feature was the washer and dryer, after traveling for two weeks it was a welcome relief to take clean clothes home without huge expense. (Tip here though - perhaps the inclusion of a clothes rack for those of us that don't like using the dryer.) 

The provision of a beach bag with towels, fresh fruit, sunscreen and water was unexpected and so thoughtful.

My husband had become ill one morning and after asking and receiving directions to a local doctor we received a voice mail the next day enquiring about his health - I mean seriously have you ever heard of such consideration!

All the staff were so lovely, it was so refreshing to sit at the bar enjoy a cocktail (which were exquisite) and chat to the staff about what was happening in Waikiki and generally enjoying their company.

An amazing location, amazing facilities, staff that appear to absolutely love their jobs - I've been spoilt as I don't think I'll ever be able to replicate this experience again....

We had booked a 1 bed + den ocean view suite but we were given a complimentary upgrade to a 2 bedroom + den suite on the Trump Floor. 

As we didn't get to see our original room so I can't really say whether staying on the Trump floors are worth the added expense, but what I can tell you is that the furnishings and amenities on the Trump Floor were top notch. I think the most wonderful part of the experience had to be the breathtaking view that we were treated to from every window though - it really did add to the experience. 

A highlight for us (particularly since we were travelling with small children) was the wonderfully stocked kitchen. I've never stayed in an apartment style hotel where something I needed wasn't missing but this didn't happen at the Trump Waikiki. We were even able to cook a full Thanksgiving meal with all the trimmings from scratch without having to scrounge around for a ladle or grater etc. The in room laundry was also put to good use during our stay.

The Trump Kids programme provided some great amenities for our children including a lovely whale soft toy, Hawaiian colouring books and a welcome treat. Our room was also stocked with a crib, diapers and kids toiletries all of which we greatly appreciated. 

As other have mentioned the service was a standout feature of this hotel. Everyone from the housekeeping staff to management seemed to go out of their way to be helpful and kind. 

We used the pool and it was quiet and small but perfectly adequate for a hotel in the middle of Waikiki. We also had a few meals and drinks pools side and some drinks and light meals in the bar. The staff here definitely know how to make a fantastic MaiTai. 

Location wise the hotel is very well placed for getting to the main strip of Waikiki and Ala Moana. The walk to beach is very short so we didn't feel that we missed out by not staying on the beach. Honestly, I am not a huge fan of Waikiki beach anyway - it is quite crowded. If you are a true beach lover it is probably worth experiencing some ocean front serenity on the North Shore or one of the islands. 

Next time we are in Waikiki we won't hesitate to stay here again.","Date of stay: November 2013","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The room was spacious, the bathroom was spectacular and that bed! The sheets are so soft and the pillows and mattress are so comfortable!

The standard of cleaning is beyond belief, I believe the housekeepers come in several times a day to do touch-ups, provide water and make sure everything is in order. Each evening they would leave the radio on in our room so we would return to Hawaiian music – such a nice touch.

The Trump should be commended on its employee’s, their standard of customer service is exceptional. I have never stayed at any hotel that had such high attention to detail, it feels as though the Trump has thought of everything and no question we asked the concierge was too hard, they always answered with a smile. Kristy from the concierge was very helpful and booked us several tours, giving us several options and explaining the pro’s and con’s of each.

Above all things the service is genuine, my partner felt unwell one day and I left him at the hotel while I hit the shops (a girl has to shop). In the afternoon the housekeeping department called to ask if everything was okay and when he would like the room cleaned – he told them he was just resting as he wasn't feeling the best. A moment later he has another call from the manager this time (housekeeping had advised the manager that he wasn't feeling well) offering to get a doctor or bring him up some tea – the level of care they show guests is touching.

Prior to arrival I had an email from Trump’s attaché service asking about any special requirements or celebrations (it was my birthday and thanksgiving) and they also confirmed the two restaurant bookings we had made on-line.
We were welcomed at arrival with necklaces and drinks.
This year we had a deluxe room, slightly larger than last year’s room and we certainly enjoyed having the extra bit of space (and partial ocean view). The fully equipped kitchen is a bonus and a rarity for the main hotel chains in Waikiki.
Two slices of cake, on a plate iced with ‘Happy Birthday Nicholas’, were delivered on our first evening, a very nice and appreciated touch.
We have always found the service at Trump impeccable, with staff welcoming, friendly and engaging.
I was a bit apprehensive before our first stay with its location being at the end of the main strip but that apprehension didn’t last long given the service and quality of the hotel.
The gym is pretty good. Beach bags with water, fruit, sunblock and towels for the beach are readily available from the ground floor desk. Rooms are serviced twice daily. Beds are large and comfortable.

Somebody gave us a short tour while a bell boy took our luggage that would make it to our room.  We were offered refreshing cucumber water while we quickly checked in.
The room was beautiful.  The kitchen had everything we needed to make meals.  The only weird thing was that the shower didn't have any kind of curtain.
The staff is excellent.  Everyone is so friendly and helpful.  Housekeeping was super attentive.  The people at the concierge desk helped us out when we needed.  They took care of mailing a post card for us amongst other things.  We were celebrating our 10th anniversary and were given some complimentary goodies.
The exercise room is a little small, but has everything you need for a short work out (including water and apples).  The computers are in the library if you need to print something out.
It was a great place to stay for a romantic trip.  I chose this hotel specifically because it didn't really have a family vibe from other reviews and their website.  There were some families with small children there, but it wasn't like you would hear kids crying through walls or running up and down the hallways.  If we go again, we would probably only stay here a couple of nights then switch to a hotel that's a little less expensive, but it was a great place to be.

The service is among the best I've encountered in Hawaii, and the location puts you right in the middle of all the Waikiki action.  Of course no hotel is perfect, and Trump Waikiki has a few flaws – some easily corrected, some not; that said, I’d stay here again if/ when I am in Honolulu again.  

Where Trump really shines though is in their service.  Everyone from the valets, restaurant servers, concierge, and front desk team work in sync to make sure all requests are worked through as efficiently and easily as possible.  In addition, the concierge desk has a service I’ve never seen anywhere else before.  Specifically, when you are heading to the beach they give you a Trump Waikiki beach bag filled with complimentary towels, bottled water, fruit, and sunscreen.  When you’re finished at the beach (or wherever else you want to take the bag), you give the dirty bag to the concierge on your way into the hotel, they clean it, and give you a fresh one the next day on your way out.  This was an awesome service that every 5-star hotel in Hawaii should do.

The room I stayed in was a Superior Partial Ocean View Studio.  At roughly 400 square feet it was appointed beautifully (a super comfortable bed, furnished lanai, fully stocked kitchen, marble bathroom); and though it wasn't small, it was not overly spacious either.  This was fine for my trip since I was the only one staying in the room, but things could get tight if two or more people were in my room for more than a couple of days.  I also noticed a few other strange things about the room, specifically: there was only one phone (by the desk), so wake-up calls were a bit of a pain; there weren't any electrical outlets near the bed; the closet was extremely small (again, fine for one person, more than one, might get tough); and while it was nice to have a kitchenette area, it would have been nicer if the bathroom and/ or living area were a bit larger, taking over some of that space.

As for the rest of the hotel, it’s definitely appointed to the 5-star level that one would expect from the hotel.  Specifically, the lobby, Wai’Olu bar, pool area, and spa are all very pretty, and well maintained.  If one were to nitpick though, the pool area is small (though very pretty, and more than adequate for dipping into when coming back from a day at the beach), the gym is extremely small, and the spa is really just 4 massage rooms (there isn't any kind of “spa area” with a steam room or showers – instead each massage room has its own private shower, but that’s it for the facilities).  

Overall though, Trump Waikiki is a great hotel, and easily one of the top choices in Waikiki.  The location can’t be beat, and neither can the service.","Date of stay: January 2014","Trip type: Traveled with friends","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

They provide beach bags for all guests and it was a quick 5 minute walk to the beach. Location-wise, its near the beginning of the waikiki shopping area, probably a 10 min walk and you'll be surrounded by tonnes of stores.

this is a great hotel, and the location isn't bad; but, the location isn't great for people who want easy access to the heart of waikiki's beach scene.  if one walks along either kalia road or the beach to access waikiki beach, the path is blocked by the sheraton and royal hawaiian; but, using kalakaua avenue one block north of the hotel will get you there.  there was so much to do on oahu (rental car recommended), that i didn't mind being off waikiki beach -in fact, it was nice to be away from the crowd of (other) tourists.  when i discovered breakfast at orchids restaurant at the halekulani (the second hotel up kalia road), i ate there every day; it's beach-front, elegant, and heavenly.  but back to trump: on balance, the multiple positives outweigh the small negatives.","Date of stay: September 2013","Trip type: Traveled solo","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We were staying on floor 25 at room 2502 it was basically a apartment with two bedrooms. It wasn't a ocean view room but still had a pretty amazing view of the ocean from the master bedroom. Nothing was ever too much to for the front of house either they were great. The converges were great they even recommended restaurants in other hotels which were good. The free wifi was great and worked everywhere and was not to slow. The gym was good small but everything was very modern. The one thing that let this hotel down is the small pool but it's not that bad. The tubs in the rooms were pretty amazing! After reading other reviews about not being beach front like its basically a two minute work across the road and down alley way.

We were greeted with warm smiles, friendly aloha's and lovely lei's. We stayed here for 7 nites in October and were not disappointed. A surprise upgrade put us into a gorgeous room with a large lanai facing out towards the ocean. It also gave us a super vantage point to watch the Friday night fireworks and superb sunsets! Our room was wonderfully appointed and so spacious, with a well stocked kitchenette with a fridge, coffee maker and organic teas. It was also very quiet. The bathroom had a huge shower, deep bath, double sinks, and plenty of fluffy towels - stocked up regularly. It also had ample supply of quality toiletries. The bed was super comfortable and having it turned down each night was such a nice 'homely' touch! After a few nights here we received a lovely gift - a nice surprise! The staff were always friendly - no matter where we encountered them. The concierge was helpful and accommodating. Being able to collect towels, cold water (with some fresh fruit) each time you went out to the beach was a great extra bonus. Location of this hotel is an easy walking distance to plenty of eating places, shopping and links for buses and trolleys. This hotel may cost slightly more than others, but after staying at other places in Hawaii, we will definitely return and base ourselves here.

It is a very nice hotel and has many good points but I wished we had stayed in the Halekulani Hotel down the road and would when we come back.

This is a smart hotel and the studio rooms are very nice. A good kitchen with everything you'd want and nice toiletries. The common parts are good but small with limited facilities. It really is an upmarket apartment block with a small bar, a small lap pool and a smallish restaurant. The staff are very friendly and nice  but it doesn't feel like a premier league luxury hotel. The concierge did what we asked but had to be chased on a few things and certainly didn't surprise and delight. The breakfast service was disorganised and lacked management. 

The hotel was very busy as is honolulu at this time, everywhere is packed out. But we are residents and at times couldn't get a seat in our hotel bar. There is no preference given to residents. This would never happen at a Mandarin Oriental or Shangri La. There was a New Years event in the hotel yet to get tickets we were told we had to go online and book ourselves. This would never happen in a really good hotel. In the end the event was a shambles and we couldn't get in. 

You pay an awful lot of money to stay here, particularly at this time of year. It was a real splurge for us and didn't feel special. it's a good 4 star but doesn't make it beyond that. The furnishings are all traditional with no real design sharpness and it is a good block from the beach. There are other hotels right on the beach that do better than Trump. 

I enjoyed the stay. The hotel is nice, there's nothing wrong with it,  but it doesn't have any real tropical beach vibe and it isn't special. Don't be taken in by the Tripadviser reviews, it feels like a good city business hotel. If you are on business great; if you are on holiday stay somewhere on the beach with more facilities.

Everything that's been said here is correct. The rooms are very clean and spacious, most of the staff are courteous and polite. This was a ""splurge"" for me, as i tend to err on the side of practicality and am very budget-conscious, but it was a milestone birthday so I said, what the heck. They sent me a slice of cake on my birthday -- an upgrade would be nice but that didn't happen. The room had a city view overlooking Saratoga St, and was looking into another hotel's poolside (Embassy Suites?).  There was a partial ""peek"" into the ocean.  Received a food credit to use anywhere in the hotel and used it for breakfast, which as expected of a 5-star hotel, was on the pricey side. But the variety of food available was very good.

Cleanliness is very important to me and this hotel is well-kept and very clean.  You really do get what you pay for. The beach bags with towels, water, and a fruit are a nice touch. Location is good, a nice walk to the beach, restaurants, or the main shopping street (Kalakua?).   You will have to walk through a dimly-lit street at night with not a lot of foot traffic coming back from Kalakua, so keep this in mind if you are a woman travelling alone. 

Overall, it was a wonderful stay and I would not hesitate to stay here again if I had the extra $$$, and I would definitely recommend it for a ""foolproof"", wonderful vacation.  I am going back to Waikiki next month and will stay at a cheaper hotel, will be writing a review for comparison.","Date of stay: January 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

She led us to reception where we were given water and moist towels while we checked in.  Our room was beautiful with ocean views, a wonderful comfortable bed with a choice of pillows and the quietest hotel room I have every been in.  They think of everything at the Trump, even having beach bags for use supplied with towels, sunscreen, waters and fresh fruit.  Even though the Trump is off beach front, it doesn't matter.  Waikiki beach is just steps away and you can enjoy a swim or sun bathe.  My suggestion is to stop by an ABC store and buy an inexpensive float ($2.00) for the ocean. It is the little touches that make this a world class hotel, when we came back from dinner our bed was turned down, soft music playing and the shell leis were formed into hearts.

The view is fantastic and panoramic  - directly onto the ocean.  Be aware though that the hotel is set back one block from the beach itself, and there is an ugly apartment block between the hotel and the beach which could block the view from lower floors.  Rooms are quite traditionally furnished but spotlessly clean and with a very well-equipped kitchen area (pots, pans, implements -even a rice cooker).  Only drip filter coffee though, a common problem in US hotels.  The shower is over a deep bath with a high rim which could be an issue for anyone less agile.  Pillows and bedlinen excellent, but the bed a bit too firm for my liking.  WiFi speedy and consistent.  Without a doubt, as others have said, the standout factor is the attitude and professionalism of the staff from the welcome at the door onwards, and it is that that would bring me back to this hotel.

The rooms. Incredibly unattractive and cramped. I would have to spend a great deal more money to get something with a better view or slightly more space and maybe, just maybe it'll be worth it.

The Spa was great and I enjoyed the breakfast buffet.

I'll try again but after recently visiting Maui for the first time, it might only be for a short visit.

*If you can afford the Trump Floor, great views as it's above the Halekulani and Outrigger Reef. The Sheraton does block some of the view if you are in the XX10 room layout, but the XX09 layout is my favorite as it takes advantage of the corner facing Fort DeRussy which has nothing blocking the view.

*Highly recommend the use of the Trump Attaché program -- nice to have the refrigerator stocked with grocery items we use at home. $25 fee for the service, but if you are going to buy these items when you get here, save yourself the trouble and utilize the service.

*Used the Trump Spa this time around -- very friendly staff who went out of their way to fit all of our request services into a progressive schedule. They even called the Halekulani Spa to set up a haircut for me since they don't have the capability internally!

Beautiful apartment and the most amazing views of both beach by day and city skyline at night.
We always stay in aparments when we travel, as I have Coeliac's. It was the best equipped kitchen we have ever come across, everything you need. Plenty of china, wine glasses, champagne flutes, plastic ware for the balcony, bake ware, blender, hand mixer and even a rice cooker. As I love to cook, it was even better getting a meal ready and having amazing views from our kitchen, for me it doesn't get better that this!
Dean and Julia greeted us on arrival, a beautiful warm welcome, and throughout our stay it was the same, our two boys adored them. Then we had gorgeous Dennis, he took care of all our tours, car hire, and booking, nothing was too much trouble. Joanna in housekeeping was great.
Jeff in managmeent and Marion in attaché made sure all our needs were meet, ( we had a little concussion at check in with misspelt name, but all was resolved immediately). They could not do enough for us, making sure our stay was a wonder experience.
Our room was a beautiful tranquil space, spectacular views and well decked out. Bathrooms had lots of towels and toiletries, our ensuite has a washer and dryer, come in handy as we were there for two weeks.
When you went to the beach, you would collect a beach bag at concierge with towels, sun screen, cold water and fruit, fantastic.
The weather was perfect, averaged about 28 each day. It was sad to leave, but we have something to look forward to, as we will be back soon!
We would like to pass on our sincere gratitude to all staff and managment at Trump Wakiki, your care, concern, and hospitality was immensely appreciated.

At so many levels the hotel exceeds your expectations and then some - 
The staff are to be awarded the friendliest most helpful people in Hawaii award - always catching your eye to be courteous - ask if you need help - seek you out for follow up to an enquiry - amazing 
The location is perfect across the road from the beach, parkway and close to the main shopping 
The hotel has a small but practical Gym - functional 
Our rooms were serviced well and clean - balcony was gorgeous
We used the hotel restaurant and Michael, lindsay and crew were great - to be commended - always serving professionally 
You wont go wrong if you are looking for a place that will provide you with a sanctuary after a long day soaking up the sun and shopping
Its quietly understated and away from the hustle and bustle of Hawaii 
Ok enough - I highly recommend this place ad hope I get the chance to stay again

It seems everyone just wants you to experience the best.  We stayed in an ocean view studio, which was perfect for us.   We don't typically spend much time in our room, so decided not to get the 1 BR.   The hotel is not on the beach, but it is only a 3 minute walk.  There are chairs and umbrellas for rental on the beach.  My only complaint would be the size of the pool, and the number of babies in it.   Would be nice if there were an adult only pool and a family pool.   

There are many restaurants, bars and lots of shopping within a block of the hotel.  We would definitely stay here again.  We actually booked our room through Hawaii5-0 vacation rentals.   Got a great price, and since no one was booked for the day we checked out, we were able to have a very late check out, which worked great with our night flight home.","Date of stay: November 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We were greeted with lei's when we exited our car. Our bags were taken to our room while we headed to check in. At check in, the lady already knew our names and we were offered something to drink. When we entered our room, the radio was on with hawaiian music, the curtains closed and the bed opened. We were celebrating our ten year anniversary and there was a special card and small gift for us. Everyday our room was made twice, in the morning and in the evening. Our room was spacious, with a sofa and kitchenette. There is privacy because you cannot hear any noise from other rooms or the hallway. The hotel is in a nice area, close to waikiki beach and the main street in Honolulu. I thought the location was great. At night you can walk on the main street and safely return.

The restaurants provided similarly high levels of service but the food was good rather than great. The restaurant prices were a bit steep.

As for the location, it is very good but I was under the mistaken impression that the hotel was literally on the water's edge which is not the case. Still, it is a reasonably short walk.

We were upgraded to a two bedroom ocean view suite on the 30th floor. The room occult not have been more fabulous. Gorgeous views of both the ocean and the mountains. Full kitchen (way beyond a kitchenette) with full refrigerator, range, dishwasher. The master bath was my favorite part. Clean white walls with white/gray marble. Open shower, big tub, two sinks and a W.C. The toiletries were fantastic. They smelled great, and had goodies you don't typically see like bath salts and sugar scrub.

I was very surprised by how small the pool was. I'm only 5'4"" and was able to touch both sides when I turned sideways. And the ocean view is obstructed by an ugly condo building. It is also not beach front. Probably a seven minute walk to the beach, and there aren't any Trump chairs to sit in or anything (that I saw).

You are very close (5 min walk) to great shopping. Both high end and local beachwear and souvenirs. Plenty of restaurants too.","Date of stay: November 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

We stayed here after an amazing experience at the SoHo location and were not disappointed.

We originally booked a city view superior studio, but were upgraded to a city view deluxe studio, which was greatly appreciated. We were celebrating our first anniversary and were pleasantly surprised to find that in addition to the complimentary Honolulu cookies (which are amazing - we bought these for gifts for coworkers/family at the numerous Honolulu Cookies stores nearby) we had a certificate for a bottle of champagne in the Wai 'Olu Lounge.

We had dinner in the Wai'Olu Lounge on a Friday evening. I'd recommend a reservation for a weekend. We did not plan ahead (though the hotel was great about asking us if we wanted assistance with reservations), but were able to get an inside table as a walk in. There is entertainment in the Lounge on most evenings. The musician on Friday evenings is fantastic. The food was good and our waiter, a local college student, was extremely attentive. 

The room itself was amazing and everything you'd expect of the Trump International brand. The bathroom included both a shower and deep tub. Some other reviewers complained about having to mop up water from the shower, since it does not have a door. We did not have this experience. In fact, housekeeping ensured that we had no less than 3 towel bath mats in the bathroom at a time, so we never had an issue. 

The bed was extremely comfortable, especially given the fact that this hotel has a pillow bar. We were able to order neck and body pillows to the room throughout the stay. Housekeeping was extremely attentive. It is probably the best of any hotel I've stayed, especially given the fact that there is a kitchen in each room. 

The only hiccup during our stay was a spa experience. The hotel took care of this for me, so I can only give the staff, again, high marks. I did expect the spa to have a more luxurious feel to it, given the location and price of the treatments. To be fair, think I was only expecting more since the Trump Soho spa is so picturesque! I wouldn't deter you from trying the spa here, the staff was extremely attentive and polite. Everyone knows mistakes happen and this hotel chain more than makes up for it when they do!

The pool has flavored water each day, great towel service, 30 spf sunscreen, and pool side service, that is laid back/not at all aggressive. Greatly appreciated!! The pool is small, but was never overly crowded. Granted, we did stay during mid-November when many children are in school. The beach bags each day included water, towels, fruit, and sunscreen. What's not to love? If I we return, I won't even pack sunscreen. Its available in both the bags and the pool. 

As far as the location, spending time on the BUSY beach, I was happy to not be beachfront. You're only a block away and being next to DeRussy Park is an excellent, quieter location. 

Kudos to the Trump Hotel staff!! We had a late flight and the front desk staff more than accomodated us with a late check out. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and are excited to explore other Trump properties.","Date of stay: November 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The people are extremely welcoming and friendly.  This is a nice place to stay if you want to stay in Waikiki (traffic is terrible).  

The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because of the internet (or lack thereof).  The internet is quite choppy -- often unavailable, often extremely slow.  They give you free internet, I have an Apple iPad and just had problems.  Given this is a trump hotel, would Donald Trump allow this to be the case?

The hotel was very serene and the service was top notch. The attaché service was definitely 5 star service. Any time we requested something, it was always followed up on in timely fashion. We couldn't remember the name of the older gentleman who first greeted us when we pulled our car in but he was very attentive and helpful in directing us. We even checked in couple hours early!

 We were pleasantly surprised when the front desk offered complimentary upgrade to one bedroom ocean view suite with den (we were originally booked for 1 bedroom partial ocean view).

I don't mean next day followup calls but within 5 minutes after their service staff completed their work.

The room has some amazing feature such as AC is controlled by censor, so AC won't work if the patio door is open or when you leave the room. 

Swimming pool is bit small but it is outdoor heated pool. There are many young families who travel with young children, and it's thoughtful of the hotel to provide diapers at pool area. Swimming pool is located on 6th floor so it's very relaxing to swim there while you also get some view of Wakiki beach. If you want to go to beach, they provide you a beach bag including towel, water, fruits and sunscreen.

We had a late flight, and the hotel was very accommodating to let us check out late. We really enjoyed our stay with Trump International Hotel Wakiki Beach, and staff make us feel special.

The cons
not a good location. not on the beach cant see the beach.  so so decor.  
the valet was a cluster.  no one knew who was coming or going. not organized 
the spa?  was an absolute joke.  I have been to 5 star spas all over the world and they claim this is a high top spa with high top prices.  the most I have ever spent at for manicure and pedicure which was no big deal.  they had to carry the hot water in for your pedicure.   no tub no sauna no steam no changing room.

Minor issue is that the shower does not have a door, so water leak out to the bathroom, so you have to mop it with your towels.

I already deal w/traffic at home in the Bay Area. We generally do not hit Honolulu when we visit the islands since it's pretty much another urban area but we had not been there in years and wanted to visit friends as well.     The Trump hotel is great, expensive, in the center of the touristy area; walkable to everything.   We were on the 33rd floor w/a great view of the ocean and toward Diamond Head but if you're into the wkly fireworks show on Fridays at the Hilton Village, ask for that side of the hotel.   Other than that we loved the place, also rec'd an upgrade w/out asking even though we went thru a 3rd party, nice surprise.  Also rec'd a box of Honolulu Cookies upon our arrival-LOVE those cookies!  Bottles of water in the car, in the bedrooms, all over the place-it was great service and especially the valet team and doormen, so gracious.","Date of stay: September 2013","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Overall hotel was very comfortable.  Rooms were nice - no cold water in the fridge though nor any bottles of water?  Restaurant was a let down - it was quite informal and was expecting better views.  The hotel is smaller and you don't feel like it is a bed factory.  We stayed at the Sheraton Waikiki and that was terrible - too large and poor service.

It was a nice hotel but in comparison to other hotels stayed at around the world - quite expensive and nothing that has the WOW factor.","Date of stay: October 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

As usual the rooms are lovely - they are pretty much identical no matter which floor you stay on. 

Our 5 person family stays in a 2 bedroom and the only thing I would say is a two bedroom with den is better - the living spaces are very much smaller in a straight two bedroom. 

The staff at Trump are impeccable - especially Dean! Never fails to be helpful and friendly especially to our small children. 

They have closed in the concierge area slightly which I am not sure I like - it was lovely to drive up to an open and welcoming area but I do understand the motive behind it. 

Poolside beverages and food services are excellent, the only slight complaint our kids had was the pool was almost too hot!","Date of stay: October 2013","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

On the first occasion the employees could not do enough to be nice.  This time, not so. Just going through the day to day things that they have to do.  We had room service and it came promptly, but the food was sub par.  The first time the hotel gave a nice size box of Honolulu Cookie Company cookies--yum!  This time I asked where they were and I got a small box on day two.  The first time they agreed to include breakfast.  This time they refused.  We were told they had a package and could have the buffet for $28 a day each.  Food is not their strong suit to we went to local places. Otherwise it is a nice place, but we will try somewhere else the next time.

When we pulled up we were immediately greeted by the valet and someone that welcomed us with a very unique lei and escorted us up to check in. Once we reached the check in desk we were offered flavored water and just felt like we were the only people they were concerned about.  

We reserved a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom oceanfront suite plus den and ended up on the 22nd floor overlooking Fort DeRussy park. Since we arrived on a Tuesday we had a great view for the fireworks done by the Hilton Hawaiian Village on Tuesday and Friday nights. Everything you could think of is in your condo, even a rice cooker. One thing I liked that I've never experienced at any other hotel is that before you arrive they allow you to create a list of groceries that will be in the room when you arrive. Since we had a 10 hour flight and didn't get into the room until about 6pm it was a very nice touch.

We did order room service two of the nights we were there, and other than being out of one of the dishes we wanted, it was amazing and very prompt service. Others have mentioned that they never saw housekeeping, but we seemed to run into them every time we came back to the hotel. It became like a joke to us as we were approaching the door. We would just go out, sit on the balcony and stare at the ocean until they were finished. They also offer a turn down service a little after 7pm which was great. I loved the bed in the room and thought it was a great balance of soft and firm.

If you can, take advantage of the spa! It was amazing. I surprised my mom with the trip to Hawaii for her birthday/Mother's Day present which included the spa visit. We did the Reflexology massage, a facial and manicure and pedicure. The attendant that did my mom's massage could tell by a knot on her foot that she has stomach problems. Very relaxing.

The bottom line is that we would stay here again in a heartbeat! When we come back to Honolulu its the only place we will stay from now on.","Date of stay: October 2013","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We are not wealthy, so it was a bit of a splurge for us, but turned out to be TOTALLY worth it.

The best thing I can say about the Trump Waikiki is the staff. I experienced nothing but the most friendly people working at this hotel. From the moment we arrived, we were treated like royalty. Upon checking in we were brought cold wash cloths and melon infused cold water, along with some nice look black and white leis. The bagman brought our luggage up and refused my help with anything.

Room cleaning services were wonderful. Room service was timely and delicious. Our room was a studio suite, which is among the simpler rooms the Trump has to offer. Even so, it was probably the nicest room I have stayed in at a hotel. Spacious, modern, clean. I couldn't have been happier.

The hotel does not have parking, only valet. The cost is something like $30/night. So if you are renting a car be prepared for that (in addition to tipping a valet quite a bit). But they were always friendly. We rented a car, and it was easy to just call down to have my car brought around, before going down to the lobby. So convenient.

This hotel thinks of everything. The bathroom has every amenity you can think of: obviously soap and shampoo, but also conditioner, shower caps, sewing kit, toothbrush, toothpaste, mouthwash, lotion, q-tips, nail files... You name it, the Trump already had it for you.

Our kitchenette was fully stocker with dishes and silverware. We were also pleased to find just about every extra we would have needed, had we decided to cook more: blender, hand mixer, rice cooker, toaster, an awesome coffee maker, pots, pans, and so much more. It was all neatly stored. After dirtying dishes, house keeping washed them and put them away for us each day.

Our room had an ocean view balcony (called a lanai in Hawaii). The view was absolutely beatiful. We also had a very nice view of the weekly fireworks shot off by another nearby hotel.

I could go on and on about this hotel. The bottom line for me is this: This hotel is worth every penny. If you want to be treated amazingly and feel like royalty for a week, stay at the Trump.","Date of stay: October 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The Position is excellent behind just a 110 yard walk across the road to a family friendly stretch sandy beach which is shared by the busy and bustling Outrigger Reef and the stylish old world luxury charm of the Halekulani Hotel. Within walking distance of the hotel,, ie 100-500 yards is a multitude of restaurants, shops, convenience stores, bars, ext, so boredom will not set in for most types of travellers.
The check in courteous and efficient with a peaceful outdoor lounge available for arriving guests to get comfortable after a long flight from the US mainland, Australia and Asia. The rooms are modern, clean and spacious, with many equipped with a kitchen that was serviced and cleaned daily by the obliging and friendly housekeeping staff. Room service and requests were promptly catered to with a smile, with most requests that a young family ( 2 adults and 2 kids of 4 & 6) would require such as ice, milk, assistance on how to use the room, ect. The outlook of the rooms  were superior on the parkside as they did not receive the noise of adjoining hotel which seemed to have noisy family orientated loud music every night in the July holidays, which did not seem to bother us to much as the guests seemed to enjoy themselves. 
The facilities of the hotel cater well to the 5 star traveller, with the main gripe being as mentioned by many other fellow travellers and even the management humbly acknowledge the fault....the small pool. Now Mr Trump, you should have been less greedy in trying to fit as many apartments & rooms in the hotel and allowed for a larger pool that caters for the large amounts of guests who dont all want to go the sandy crowded beach. The pool is about 50ft x 10ft, and is more of a glorified lap pool that has to cope with the demands of hyperactive children seeking energy expansion, sun worshipping couples, parents entertaining the kids and the odd mature couple observing the chaos. The small spa is very cosy and quite social as we all packed in there to get some warmth when the deck area had no sun ( it only has sun the afternoon due to its orientation). The next facility that was less than desired was the gym. It was an afterthought by the developer, it seems like an unwanted office space was converted into a tiny indoor gym, but at least they offered you one. 
The food offerings at breakfast which was served in outdoor cafe on the pool floor, was not large, but the quality was very decent for the region. The advantage of the Trump was the attachment of the franchised BLT steak and seafood restaurant which offered a world class standard of meat and seafood grill dishes with excellent service. We found this place excellent and very accommodating for a family seeking quality food ( expect to pay for it though!). We tried the nearby famous restaurant of Roy's, which was too noisy, crowded and vibrant for my liking with the food somewhat quite average for the price. Stick to the classy BLT in my opinion for a all round experience and even Nobu ( 100 yards away). 
Overall the experience in comparison to the other 5 star hotels was excellent, with only the much pricier Halekulani being superior in food offerings and ambience, but more suitable to well heeled conservative travellers seeking peace in the epicentre of Waikiki. The Trump probably offers the best value in the Waikiki in terms of luxury, position, service and price, however it would receive five stars from me only if the developer was not so greedy and constructed a larger pool and a proper spacious gym with sauna.","Date of stay: August 2013","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Of course the service and quality exceeds that of a 5 star hotel.  We stayed 9 days and things we find annoying at other hotels are covered here.  There are enough towels to last two days if ever needed.  Your room is serviced immediately on request, so when you return you can relax.  The evening turn down service is available if you need it.  We had a full kitchen if you have a cook in the family!! Located on the edge of the Waikiki hotels it's quiet at night and you don't hear your neighbours.  The pool is suitable for a dip but if your kids want to have water fights perhaps a resort would be best suited. Once you've had your dip the pool staff will look after you with drinks, food, sunscreen,  or anything else your heart desires.   The hotel is not on Waikiki beach front but is a hop skip and a jump away...and not an issue.  Maybe Trump will purchase the outrigger in front of the hotel and build a walkway between the two.....   Be sure to try BLT it's just like the Melbourne Rockpool.

It's a great hotel and worth the money you pay, we had a room on the 18th floor with a great view of Waikiki beach, so very happy with everything, except, and this is the really sad part, because it happened the night before we were due to leave.  I had an Armani shirt stolen from my room by one of the house keeping staff. The shirt still had the tags on and was hung in the wardrobe. I only noticed it missing when we were packing to leave. I've stayed at many hotels around the world and this is the first time I've ever had an article of clothing stolen. 

We notified the hotel management and they were very good in dealing with our issue, they even reimbursed me for the cost of the shirt, as I had the original purchase tags with me,so no complaints there. But i really would have expected more from the house keeping staff, and not what I expected from a hotel of this class.

Management said they would follow up with us on our return and to date no further follow up from them, disappointing.  

If you do stay here, keep an eye on your possessions including clothing and do not ever leave anything in your room that is of any value.

The location is not directly on Waikiki beach, but it is across the street, less than a five minute walk.  

The hotel itself is luxury class.  We had a partial beach view and I have to say that the view of the ocean was worth it. We spent a lot of time on the patio drinking wine and watching the sunset.  All the rooms have a kitchen area equipped with a stove, refrigerator, microwave and plates/cooking ware.    

The bathroom was well appointed with luxury toiletries (Bvlgari) which is a nice touch in a hotel like the Trump.  The bed was amazing - very soft and comfortable.

The hotel has a gym which my husband used every day we were on vacation.  It was well appointed to and was convenient to locate.  

The hotel pool is quite small compared to the other hotels on Waikiki.  This pool is really meant to lounge and possibly swim a few laps, but this is not your typical resort type of pool which sprawls out and has a party scene.  Very relaxing pool area with bar service, but quiet and serene (which was what i was looking for on this trip).

The hotel location allows you to reach many fine restaurants and shops within minutes.  The location is a definite five stars.   

Just in case you have not been to Waikiki beach, it is not the best beach on this island.  It is quite crowded and is not as clean as I had imagined it would be. My husband and I rented a car for the day (which you can set up through the concierge) and took a drive to the other parts of the island where the beaches were quiet and perfect.

HUGE beautiful room and awesome bed, HUGE marble bathroom, FANTASTIC private view of the park and beach/ocean, and AMAZING service throughout the hotel. It is the little things that make a difference, and Trump has these all covered from service from arrival to cleanliness of rooms/gym, pool/beach packs with water/fruit/sunscreen/towels, and friendly Concierge and staff around the hotel. Check in and out also made special, and whilst a big hotel they have managed to make it feel intimate the the hotel rarely felt crowded (and balcony private also due to building design). Only setback (if only minor) was the hotel only having 4 lifts and one broken during our stay leading to some longer waits at times given 38 floors. Eggs and Things on same road, and main restaurants 5-10 minute walk. Beach is directly across the road, and located on the quieter end from main strip with better surf waves. Overall another great stay and we would definitely stay again and recommend to others......","Date of stay: September 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

In-room amenities are very thoughtful - cotton pads, cotton swaps, slippers, bath ropes, nail filer, toothbrush, very good iron and iron board etc. They even have plenty of utensils, glasses and plates for our use in kitchen's cabinet.

This was our fifth visit to the islands and we have stayed at many different hotels in Hawaii as well as worldwide.  The family all concurred that this visit to the Trump was the best hotel that we have ever stayed at.       

The facility is very well designed and the cleanest hotel we have encountered and the staff works very hard at keeping it that way.  Speaking of the staff, and I mean EVERY staff member we came in contact with, was very friendly and helpful.  They were truly interested in your every need, even if not in their immediate job function and they all went out of their way to make sure you enjoyed your stay.

We stayed in a two bedroom plus den suite.  This hotel was very well designed, the living spaces were large and top notch and it made you feel as if you were staying at a fine home, instead of a hotel room.  We have all decided that on our next visit to Hawaii, the Trump will be out first choice for a repeat visit.","Date of stay: September 2013","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

It almost controls my life I spend most time cleaning so when I go anyplace I do so much homework on the accomodations it is sick.  You cant know anything until you get there so this time I went with Trump.  Yeah hotels can be all alike and good but this one was what you would hope a hotel to be in every way.  
DETAILS-from the moment you pull up staff greats you at the car(valet) you wont have a question that they haven't thought of and before you get confused about what you need to do or where you need to go they are right there leading you around. (talk about leave your worries on your doorstep) The staff is the ultimate staff.  They remember everything.  ROOMS-now I can't speak for every room but I spent time looking for something wrong.(i know thats not good) but I couldn't believe it. Every time we left the room it seemed they waited and went back in to clean.  If we looked for something it suddenly appeared(creepy but good) THE SPOT-The location is on point.  it is not directly on the beach so you don't have the walkers but i had ocean front view which is one small small path from water.(across from hotel) these hotels are conveniently wrapped around in a circle so that you can take the main streets on foot to all the shops, music and restaurants or walk the beach to them.  You can go behind the hotels to the shops too to avoid car traffic. Im not a walker and I walked everywhere.  note: I gave an average for the breakfast in hotel room service because I think that the selection for the price of what is an ""American Breakfast"" could have more. So hit the streets for the local foods to fill up for a good price especially if you have kids or teens.  better yet the kitchenette has so much in it you can cook  up a meal(No i didn't say that too all the Moms out there sorry-it is vacation time)","Date of stay: September 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The service is second to none. You can grab a beach bag on the way out with cold water, towels and sunscreen, they delivered us some water to the room after about 3 hours and also gave us some Hawaiian cookies with personalised notes. The rooms are excellent, top views and everything you could need and more including mouth wash!

The concierge booked a number of things for us without needing to wait and recommended a couple of great local restaurants.

The pool is small but the area itself is very nice with ocean and sunset views along with bar service including the best mai Thai I've tasted

Breakfast was fantastic, huge range and great omelettes made in front of you, smoothies ordered as your seat too!

Lunch in the on site restaurant was good but pricey.

We went to another island after 2 days and they offered to store our bags for free. Upon our return here they greeted us as 'returning customers' which we loved. Our only gripe was the time you have to wait for the lifts!!

The staff are very friendly and all seemed keen to please.
The rooms are exceptional with great décor, views and space.
Location of the hotel is good - you can walk to most places around Waikiki easily.
Restaurants are ok but possibly not up to the standards of the rest of the hotel. (see my separate review of BLT which is on the ground floor of the hotel).

The major issue - bedding.
The hotel offers two types of mattress  -  one type which is very soft and another firmer mattress. Neither of them were suitable - the hotel uses Serta mattresses. The soft one was so soft that you got very little support, whilst the firm one was so firm that it was uncomfortable.
Unfortunately, the problem was so bad that we ended up checking out early.

I had emailed in a few weeks prior, to request the early check in, but it was really nice to get it along with the upgrade. We had a partial ocean view one bedroom apartment. It was very spacious, the kitchen daws and cupboard with every possible item of cookware you can think of. You could literally have had a dinner party in there. There is a separate lounge area and then the bedroom.  The Bathroom can be accessed via the entrance hall, or th bedroom.  They also had a full washer and dryer and free soap powder. Sounds really sad, but I was so happy to have that facility, we had already been on hols for 12 days so running out of clean stuff. It's nice to have the option to wash your stuff without paying large laundry charges! 

The apartment was so clean, modern, really nice, could not fault it. I was a little reserved, but the photos don't do it justice at all.  The view from our small balconty was nice, especially in the night when it had a lovely breeze!  The hotel give out 'cool' bags with bottled water, fruit, towels and suncream. The beach is so close and nice. Yes it's quite busy, but it's Waikiki beach. There is enough room for everyone, and they have areas more suited to kids too, so adults can pick other areas to have more peace.  

Waikiki itself is great. It's very clean and modern. It has every shop you can want and every food place you need, from cheap tiny noodle bars, to Nobu. It's much more built up in this area. We stayed in Maui also, and it's totally opposite (maui is low buildings, Waikiki is a city place)

You must hike up Diamond Head - I am very unfit, but even I could walk it. The views are amazing. We also did Pearl Harbour as we have an interest in History and Military. It was incredible. 

Overall, Waikiki is great for a couple of days - I advise twinning it with one of the other islands, as we did to get the 'city' for a few days and then a realxing beach place on a quieter island.

I'd definitely stay in this hotel again if I go back to Waikiki.","Date of stay: August 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The service (with rare exception ) and rooms themselves are second to none. We were upgraded from one bedroom with den to 2 bedroom with den  upon arrival. Had 3 luxurious bathrooms, , 2 huge bedrooms, 2 sofabeds, 2 balconies(with gorgeous views of the beach), washer/drier, floor to ceiling windows, full modern kitchen.  In truth have traveled all over and never had this kind of room(better than four seasons suite  as well!!). Words really don't give the room and view justice. People said you lose the Hawaii feel  at the corporate trump but I would disagree .Also   the 4th lobby is beautiful and the suites are  just astounding.
Breakfast buffet at the hotel..around 30$ pp while expensive was outstanding.
The negatives..only 4 elevators in the building could be annoying but once on the elevators were very fast. We had one issue with room service  where we had to call (as they requested) to have  room service plates /food removed..We called 2x  and finally after more than an hour put the plates in the hallway ourselves. Had one problem with an elevator that lead to a stressful morning and almost missing an excursion on the North Shore that was upsetting but management handled expertly. We found all the staff from bellboys,valet, checkin , housekeeping to be remarkable. the hotel had Had free wii games ..initially called asking for a game that wasnt in stock but they delivered to my kids as soon as it was returned to them. 
Other negative as noted is pool while beautiful is way too small..we rarely used it as the beach is a short walk away . Initially I was concerned that we were a block off the beach but given our gorgeous unobstructed ocean view (ask for Fort DeRussy side, the fort btw is worth a short visit), and half block walk to the beach it is  non issue. They give you towels, fruit, water in a bag whenever you leave for the beach or an excursion( if you have an early am excursion they will  happily give you the beach bags the night before).
the place is expensive and out of our budget for the most part but was actually worth it.Our kids are spoiled for life.....
My highest recommendation.
BTW... given the level of treatment we received here, we  plan to try the Trump in NYC for our anniversary","Date of stay: August 2013","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

View from the 23rd floor is lovely from the balcony during the day and stunning at night. Service is excellent and the staff very obliging.  The housekeeping is wonderful.  The pool is a little small, but the service compensates and and the shaded areas provide some protection from the very hot sun.  The Bar service from the In-Yo Cafe is friendly and cheerful.  Nothing is too much trouble.  

What really was the icing on the cake was the provision of a hospitality room, as our flight was not until 11 pm.  This made the last day very memorable and we can only express our gratitude for such a service.

The housekeeping staff were the best we have ever had in a hotel, with the room promptly cleaned each day to the very highest standard and all the dishes washed as well.  Everyone went out of their way to assist.  The bed and pillows were great, so much so I had to investigate the Pillow brand and buy one on my return home
My only negative is the infinity pool.  It is way too small for the numbers at this hotel and was crowded beyond belief many days.
Free WiFi throughout the building was superb, especially in these days of multiple gadgets needing to be connected from the one room.  The Wai'ola lounge is extremely nice for a happy hour cocktail and tapas.  
The interesting thing, was we made the booking through Jetluxuryresorts.com and not direct to the Hotel.  I assume this was a privately owned room we were using, but it was a seamless integration and we were treated exactly as a Trump Hotel guest.  This doesn't always happen in such similar set-ups in other countries.

The valet and bell captain were extremely helpful and called us by name after the first day.

The Bell Men were so helpful when we needed help and even a slight whisper from my son that he would like to go in a Limo was fulfilled to our surprise when we requested a Taxi and the guy moved mountains to get my son to experience a Limo ride back to the airport.

It was our first time. However, the hotel experiences here were poor. The Trump at best was ordinary for a 5-star luxury hotel in Hawaii. There is no class for the money that we invested (~$550/day) in it. And, this rate was without a view; there offer no complimentary upgrades even if their hotel is empty; this is pretty typical of policy in Oahu. (I did ask anyway at the counter; they refused.) The Trump, as an independent, could do better to please their guests. In all, we did not feel rested here.

To make matters worse, I will cite 11 examples of where the staff was too low class, business minded and at times penny-pinching: 1), I choose this hotel so that my mother would have all the courtesies and be treated well. She asked for cream, halfandhalf in the room, for her daily coffee. Unfortunately, she became irate with the service when she had to argue with the service to get more than one or two packets for the entire week;  2) the lotion and shampoo bottles in the bathroom are being recycled after opened by other guests; several of them were in fact leaking; 3) I have the worst experience in the spa as a big Hawaiian woman hurt my back instead of massaging me; she was more of an average mom doing massage in a supposedly refined atmosphere. She wasn't even deterred to look at my private parts upon roller over; the other therapist pressured us to purchase products; the receptionist pressured me to put a 20% tip for the therapists. I returned to the spa at the Sheraton thereafter; they are more professional there; 4) I also choose this hotel, because I was drawn by the unique duck with the bathrobe that I saw online in an bathroom; however I had to go through the manager to get a couple of ducks without a fee. I wanted the duck with the bathrobe; so I purchased one at one own expense for $7 after spending $400 on services; 5) My mom asked for butter to be brought to the room, and the maid refused; what's up with room service?!!; 6) We were not treated that well at lunch on their terrance; 7) the concierge allowed us to borrow tape; he gave us an practically empty roll and asked us to return it afterwards; 8) everyday I was on the phone endlessly trying to get the WIFI service rebooted. (See other reviews here. This is not an isolated problem.)  If it wasn't the WIFI, the concierge put me on hold instead of calling back to confirm various tickets; I was put on hold most of the time. What a waste of my time and energy; 9) Dinner suggestions by the hotel were less than good and perhaps tainted by kickback. We in fact walked out of Alan Wong's restaurant; 10) The corridor smelled very strongly of fish; 11) the fire alarm went off; this must happen often as another reviewer just wrote about a similar happening.

Money, money, money, ...., an artificial and business-like attitude pervaded this hotel as most of the local culture in Waikiki. I sent a message to the manager, vested time in their survey, and even wrote a message to Mr. Trump himself on fb. But no one returned my emails to respond to my concerns. This hotel offers their units to be sold, or offered as time-shares. Don't come here thinking it is a refined hotel. There are none in Oahu. Most of the hotels (Mona Surfrider, Sheraton, Royal Hawaiian, and a few others) on the beach are owned by a single company, and all staff share a fundamental jaded attitude toward their guests. If you have to go here, save your money and stay at the Sheraton on the beach as long as you can get it for around $200/night. They're not refined and youngsters make too much noise. The staff can be rude. And, they offer no Leis (Hawaiian flowers) upon arrival. But at least you're on the beach, save money, and are in a vibrant area. The Sheraton is fine for family with children who want to get wet. The Trump is ok if you want a stocked kitchen and bring home your leftovers to make up the few hundred extra in room cost. But you're away from the vibrant area in Waikiki.","Date of stay: August 2013","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_20"

The ocean view deluxe studio we had was very nice, the view was fantastic,  for the price I was expecting a 1 bedroom condo, but it was all open with a King bed and sofa bed for the kids, with a kitchenette and a bathroom.    The hotel is situated across the street of the beach and the walk way to the beach is not very chic,    The pool at the hotel is very disappointing and small its about 10 ft wide by and more a design look than practical for people to swim....but it looked good!!!    The BLT resto on the ground floor was exceptional in service and the food was delicious....if you have kids, maybe not the best of hotels to stay at if you are looking for a pool, but if you like to walk to beach and like a kitchenette to cook then its a good place for the amenities!!

It's expensive.  It's five-star rated.  So, why was I amazed by the customer service at Trump Tower Waikiki?

The ""room"" was more of a well-equipped apartment with spa tub, laundry facility, and fully-equipped kitchen with wine refrigerator. There were two balconies.  The on-premises restaurant was excellent with successful fusion-style menu and informed, friendly staff.  You have to try the award-winning Mai Tai which was beyond delicious in its uniqueness.  The view from our room was virtually panoramic and included the city, park and beach.  To make a day at the beach that much easier, you can pick up a ""beach bag"" at the front desk that contains a towel, bottled water and fresh fruit.  No matter what you need, from an additional luxurious robe to help scheduling any activity, the staff is approachable and happy to meet your needs.  I only wish there were Trump hotels in more cities, so I could stay with them whenever I travel.  I didn't use the on-premises, full-service spa, but it looked top notch.

This was a room on the 21st floor but unfortunately with a limited ocean view, and facing directly towards the Embassy Suites across the road (with some very loud music on some nights). We immediately asked could we be moved to a room on the other side of the hotel with a more open aspect and with the Waikiki skyline in the distance rather than directly across the road! This is obviously the nicest side of the hotel as it is the one featured in the hotel's own promotion channel! We were told however that a comparable room was not available, but that a note would be made and that we could be offered to move during our 4-night stay. Such an offer was not made. 

However, the room itself was very luxurious with a kitchen area and balcony. This was one of the nicest hotel rooms we have ever stayed in. 

The location of the hotel is excellent - directly between the beach and the main shopping area. 

As other reviewers have noted, the infinity swimming pool is very small and narrow and was always crowded with children. However, we spent most afternoons on the loungers in the quiet area of the pool. Unfortunately, the pool area was closed at 4 pm during one of the days of our stay due to a wedding, which I feel to be rather unfair for paying guests. 

The only meal we ate at the hotel was at the Wai'olu Lounge overlooking the Waikiki skyline. This was a tapas-type meal and very enjoyable. As part of our package we had a $50 discount against any food or beverages. 

Since we had a late night flight, we asked was there a hospitality room available for use during our last day, but were told that would depend on availability on the day. We were very grateful to be told on the last morning that a room was available for our use until our flight at no extra cost. 

The Trump International Waikiki Beach is certainly a first class hotel, and all the staff we came across were extremely friendly and enthusiastic. Unfortunately for us, we regarded our suite to be more of a 'partly ocean view' rather than the 'ocean view' which we had purposefully booked. We were not convinced that the upgrade was an improvement, in particular regarding this 'ocean view' aspect. Being on the beach facing side of the hotel would have made an enjoyable stay into a memorable one.","Date of stay: August 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Easy to check in and get bags to the room.

Room was great,serviced twice daily and had a small kitchen area with a fridge. Water bottles left after visits, along with toiletries.

We were on the 15th floor on the east side of the hotel, and it is somewhat noisy.  After 3 flights lasting 27 hrs, badly needed sleep.  Fridge had an ice machine which only works in auto, so noise of ice being made interupted sleep, as did traffic noise outside.

The pool is very small, if you pace your feet on one side, you can touch the opposite side easily. Not really a pool for a lot of people.  There were a lot of families there, so lot of kids with rubber rings that really were too big for the pool,  the jacuzzi part basically becomes a kids private pool as loungers for parents right next to it.

The pool area has loungers under the eaves with shade or on the terrace with no shade. So not easy to get away from the sun if you need to.

On two occasions of the stay, the pool area was closed from 4pm due to events, so s
Resting on that days cut short.

Hotel gives you a bag with towels, water, fruit and sun cream for the beach, great touch. Although loungers and parasol for a pair is about £50/day.

Hotel concierge booked trips for us and that was easy and great. 

As this was and anniversary trip, the hotel gave us a card for a bottle of wine, however on both attempts we tried to get a table in the bar, they were full, so never actually got the wine.

The hotel is mins from the beach, great shopping and transport stops.

In all enjoyed the stay, woul probably book another hotel next Tim with a bigger pool area and away from noise.  The biggest issue for useas noise levels.","Date of stay: July 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The beach was a super short walk and they offered us a beach bag filled with towels, bottled water and sunscreen everyday of our stay if needed.

Here she turned us over to the person behind the desk, and then she came back with drinks and a cold washcloth to wash our hands.

This hotel is a great location to shopping. The beach walk is beautiful and no shortage of shops.
I think the only thing I would say a little negative about this property is the concierge.  There did always seem to be a little wait to talk to someone. When I asked about different things, they pretty much handed me a brochure and said decide what you want and we can call.  I just expected to hear a little more input of why to use a certain tour over another. They were able to book us a helicopter ride when the company was full already.

Although the stay was mostly fine, I think given the price, you would have expected better service and amenities.
First off, the wifi in the room was appalling. The strongest reception seem to be in the toilets.
At the concierge, there seem to be a long line of people and whenever we waited for the beach bag, it took a long time.
The showers in the main bedroom were poor. I mean to have aircon in the bathroom blowing wasn't cool. Also, the shower pressure was poor, a dribble rather than a power shower.
The swimming pool was so small we didn't bother.
The fold our sofa beds were so uncomfortable it was impossible to sleep - you could feel the springs.
On the plus side, we did get a great ocean view, saw the fireworks across the Hilton, the washing machine/dryer were a boon and room service food was quite decent.
Next time, I would try another hotel closer to the beach.","Date of stay: July 2013","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

The location is a block back from the beach but the hotel does have a wonderful outlook away from Diamond Head. It is very close to all the shops and to the trolley stops.
We were staying in a 2 bedroom suite, which had one of the worst layouts I have ever stayed in. The 2nd bedroom was on the other side of the suite away from the bathroom. Neither bathroom had a towel rail .... there was no where in the whole apartment to hang a towel or wet swimwear. The only small rail was over the toilet where they hung the hand towels and face cloths?!
The beds were very uncomfortable ... in the master it was 2 beds pushed together to make a king with a flimsy cover over it, so it was 2 beds with dips and then a hard ridge running around them. All of our party complained of the uncomfortable beds. The 2nd bedroom was a queen ( very small so maybe really only a double) and so we had to sleep others on the sofa bed, which again was not good.
There was no where to unpack in the master - they have a huge walk in closet but no drawers or shelves, and in the 2nd room, once the suitcase was out there was not enough room to walk around the bed on any side. 
The air conditioning was not coping while we were there. The building heats up with the afternoon sun and then has trouble cooling down.We had lunch in one of the restaurants which was okay, but reasonably priced. They do make excellent Mai Tai""s.
The pool area is very small, as is the pool. The gym was adequate but very small. Very little floor space.The ceiling heights in the hotel are very low and this was most noticeable in the gym when using the equipment.
The concierges were excellent and all their recommendations were very good.
For such an expensive property, it falls short of the luxury market and does not fit the 5star profile.","Date of stay: July 2013","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

And it in no way reflects the professionalism, industriousness and courtesy of the staff – all of whom I would give a ten star rating if I could.

The property is well located in amongst the buzzing environment of the Waikiki Beach Walk at the north end of the beach. This is a great place to be. Views from the “ocean view” side are simply stellar. Do not pay the extra for “ocean front”. It isn’t worth it. 

The in-house eating establishments are both very high quality – and actually pretty reasonably priced, given the premium price bracket of the property overall
. 
There are other nice touches, like free gifts popping up in your room, free beach bags with towels, sunscreen and water from the concierges. And as I said above, there simply aren’t enough superlatives to describe how wonderful all the staff are.

But – for what this place costs – there are a few physical downsides. The pool, and pool area are both ridiculously small. The room décor, while clean and modern was not “fabulous”- and for the price, it should have been. Parking should not cost $33 per night. The fact that the arrivals area is separate from the reception area is cumbersome – and  makes for a distinctly underwhelming arrivals experience. The concierges, who work tirelessly booking restaurants, tours, giving advice and handing out beach gear are cramped behind a small un-airconditioned desk in the arrivals bay.
 
Notwithstanding the above, a fantastic time was had and we would probably stay again. If this property cost two thirds of what it actually does I would have no hesitation in giving it a five star rating.","Date of stay: July 2013","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

Hawaiian's seem nice in general but they seemed extremely nice at the Trump hotel. They were very accommodating and work very quickly with anything that you request.  They are always smiling too. We had a rental car and drove practically all around the big island. When we were back from our drive they gave us beach bags and free bottle water so we can head out to the beach which is maybe 1/4 block away (walking distance).  At the end of the trip I asked about which pillows they used in the rooms because they felt really good and it was time for me to get new pillows at home... so they allowed me to purchase them! Yes, I had the option to purchase the room pillows at a major discounted price and since they had one in stock that was brand new, they sold that to me too!  It goes without saying that no request is too big here at this hotel. Seriously, try buying anything in the room, they will either sell it to you or give you the contact information of their supplier.","Date of stay: July 2013","Trip type: Traveled with friends","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

As mentioned in other reviews the service was excellent - some nice touches included Hawaiian Cookie company biscuits on the first night and the beach bag was awesome. Staff are very friendly. 

The location itself is also spectacular and has some great views.

The rooms however were a let down. 

They are clean and modern, but a little soulless - not a hip, clinical, Wallpaper kind of soulless (we love that!), more a recently built Novotel soulless. They do feature a full kitchen area, which would be useful if you had a family, but call me crazy when I stay at 5-star hotels I'm not really that interested in cooking.

For me they needed a little more bling, perhaps some electric blinds, digital lighting, illuminated wardrobes or a Nespresso machine. Instead for some reason the fuse box was in prime position in the lounge area and there was only one telephone not located near the bed. There were also no additional power plugs near the bed so you had to unplug the clock radio. Yeah I know this is totally nitpicking but really if they are the number one hotel in HNL I would have expected this to be sorted.

The infinity pool is nice, but the other reviewers who said this was an adult hotel obviously didn't stay in early July. Pool was full of kids and they even had water proof diapers available. This  together with the kitchen makes me think this is very geared towards families (albeit wealthy ones).

Perhaps we came here with too high expectations, but ultimately I think we could forego the cookies, beach bag and kitchen and get the same standard of room elsewhere for less.","Date of stay: July 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

international Hotel in Waikiki (Honolulu) during June.  We could not
have made a better choice.

When we arrived we were greeted by a courteous valet who took our bags
and escorted us to the elevator to the lobby.  A very friendly,
enthusiastic clerk greeted us and as we checked-in provided us with
pineapple infused water and a moistened towel. Feeling quickly
refreshed after travel, I knew already that we had made a great
decision to stay at the Trump. My five day stay confirmed this
prediction.

Hotel
The hotel is located across the street from Waikiki Beach -- literally
a 2 minute walk from the hotel lobby. The eager to please staff is
quick to offer their daily complimentary ""beach bag"" that includes
towels, cold bottled water, fruit, and suntan lotion!  You were able
to wander across the road -- fully prepared with your beach bag -- and
enjoy the world famous beach.  The balcony of the ocean view rooms
provides a perfect view of the exquisite shoreline. Every morning I
sat and soaked in the view with a cup of coffee From the 25th floor
balcony -- and was compelled to look out every time I passed the
balcony window. Currently,  a picture of this view is the wallpaper on
my iPhone so I can hold onto this memory a bit longer.

Room
We had a two bedroom suite that was incredibly roomy.  It included a
full kitchen. We did not cook as there are too many excellent
restaurants in the area but it was nice to be able to make a cup of
coffee in the morning or have a quick breakfast or snack in the room.
The room was spotless. Large, modern bathrooms were stocked with a
full array of toiletries.  There were four televisions in the room
which were never turned on because we were busy looking at the balcony
views.

Staff
Perhaps the most impressive aspect of the Trump Hotel was the staff. I
have stayed at many four star hotels throughout my life and can
honestly say that this hotel provided the best staff and service I
have experienced to date.  Everyone from the desk clerk to the
concierge to the bellman to the parking valet were exceedingly
courteous and friendly.  Their aim was to make your stay as
comfortable and enjoyable as possible. Several staff members would ask
about my plans for the day and then follow-up later on, genuinely
interested in my experience.  Several times we needed an amenity
(e.g., toothbrush) and would simply call and it was brought to our
room almost immediately.  Perhaps the best illustration of the quality
of the staff follows:  I was asking where the business room was to
print my boarding pass.  Typically staff at hotels would provide
directions.  At the Trump the bellman literally walked me to the room,
used his key to let me in, and sat me at the computer (which was fully
functional including printer stocked with paper).

Bottom line:  The Trump Waikiki is an extraordinary building located
in a perfect spot and the staff has thought of everything to make your
stay a world class experience.  This was my first stay at a Trump
Hotel and I am looking forward to staying at their other locations.","Date of stay: June 2013","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We were pleasantly surprised by the Trump in Chicago and decided to stay at the Trump in Waikiki and we're very glad we did.  (Our friends that also attended the wedding including the bride and groom stayed at the Westin and they had absolutely nothing nice to say about the service at that hotel).  

We got upgraded when we got there for free and had a magnificent full sea-view 1-bedroom.  We accidentally only booked for 4 nights and only realized it on the 4th night, but they were gracious to add another night to our booking at the same rate as our original booking, which was less than US$400.  Our room must have been at least double that price.  The location was fantastic, right next to a run-down, but efficient rental car dealer.  

The only downside was the mundane breakfast (and the no-view-breakfast area) that didn't change once during our 5 night stay there.  We could order hot food from the kitchen (included in the breakfast coupon that came with the room), but even then, it was average at best.  

We usually stay at our time share in Ko O'lina, but if we go back to Waikiki, we will definitely stay at the Trump.

We booked our room through Jet Luxury Resorts for a much lower price than booking through the hotel directly.  At first I was concerned it was a scam because I never heard of the company, but it is in fact legit and we saved about 50%.

Upon our arrival at the Trump International Hotel Waikiki Beach Walk. we had 2 people run over to grab our bags and a greeter came over to welcome our group and give us shell based Lei's.  She escorted us up to the lobby to help us check-in and also provided us with watermelon infused waters and cool wet clothes for our foreheads while we checked in.

After receiving our room key card, we got into the fastest elevator I've ever been in.  It zoomed us up to our floor where our room was waiting.  As we entered the room, there was some Hawaiian music playing in the background and we received a free gift of some gourmet cookies.  At this point, our bags arrived up to the room and we were given a tour of the room.  The staff person made a point to mention to us to avoid tripping when going out to the balcony and showed us how to turn on the stove.

Pro's:

+Maid service is twice daily.
+The room is absolutely gorgeous and spacious
+The level of service is far beyond anything I've ever received at any other hotel
+42"" flat screen HDTV with digital programming
+Free WiFi Internet
+iPod docking station for music (uses the old 30 pin style connection, not iPhone 5)
+HUGE tub if you like bath's
+Massaging shower head in the shower
+Refrigerator, Stove, Microwave, Coffee Maker, and basically a full kitchen
+Great outdoor views from balcony or seating area on 6th floor lobby
+Walking distance to public transportation bus stop ($2.50 per rider)
+Walking distance to beach and lively downtown area
+Beautifully landscaped property with gas torches light up at night
+Extremely comfortable beds and pillows with a pillow menu to order something different if you want

Con's:

-Expensive nightly rate
-$100 PER NIGHT credit card hold for incidentals (refunded if you don't buy anything)
-The two restaurants are extremely expensive ($52 for a steak w/no sides for example)
-The infinity pool is too small (narrow and only 4' deep)

Have to walk across the street to the beach but a very short walk. The hotel provides a beach bag with water, towels, sunscreen and fruit, all with a smile!  Lots of good high end shopping nearby.

I love Hawaii and wanted my family to love it as much as I do. Well Trump helped make this happen. We spent an amazing 9 nights in room 2020 which we booked through Hawaii 5-0 Vacation Rentals (fantastic people to deal with). 

From our arrival to departure we were made to feel special! Trump is the newest kid on the block and that shows in the clean and modern feel of the hotel. Cleanliness is my biggest gripe with hotels, I'm extremely fussy (a little OCD perhaps!) well Trump didn't let me down. They offer the most outstanding customer service I have ever received in any hotel I have stayed in. My young daughter was treated like a princess, the staff would come down to her level to talk to her, clapped when she sang or danced for them and offered her cold bottled water whenever she walked past the desk.

There are so many positive points with this hotel, e.g. The size of the rooms and layouts, huge marble bathrooms, fully functioning kitchens, twice daily housekeeping, beautiful views, free wifi, great pool area, complimentary beach bags, boogie boards, bottled water, umbrellas. The list could go on....if you are looking for a hotel to stay at in Waikiki - this hotel is number 1 on tripadvisor for a reason. Do yourself a favour and book a room!

Thank you Trump for making our holiday an amazing one, we will see you again in 2014!","Date of stay: June 2013","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We were greeted with a refreshing drink and floral lei on arrival and taken to our room immediately (despite arriving at 9am).  We had a deluxe ocean view room which was very spacious with a large kitchen and lounge area and a modern shower-room style bathroom.  

The facilities are great, however we were disappointed with the pool area, being located on level 4. You couldn't see the beach from there - only the old outdated hotels directly opposite, where people sit on their balconies staring down at you.  Unfortunately this hotel has no tropical or Hawaiian atmosphere to it, it really could be located in Anywhere, USA, and it would feel exactly the same.  The beach is just a short walk across the road, but again, this part of the beach has none of the atmosphere you expect of Waikiki.

This is a good quality, good value hotel, but if you're after more of a ""beachy"" holiday, try Halekulani or Royal Hawaiian, merely for their better location and atmosphere.","Date of stay: March 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

We had an early flight in from Japan and arrived at the hotel at 10:00 a.m. but check-in was not until 4:00 p.m. I believe. What to do? We were tired and our 11 year old son wanted to change and go to the beach. Not to worry, Tomomi checked us in and made an extra effort to find us a room within an hour and with an upgrade to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary. Thank you Tomomi (Front Reception), Dean (the guy who takes cares of you when you pull-up to The Trump...just a sweet guy and runs a tight crew) and Maria (Housekeeping) for making this a great trip. 

We stayed at the Royal Hawaiian last year after reading it was ""the best"" place in Waikiki. What a joke that was. The Trump Waikiki is ""THE BEST"" hotel in Hawaii. Royal Hawaiian had old feeling rooms, worthless staff,  small (unbelievably small) bathrooms and noise from the mall and the bars ruined that stay. DO NOT STAY there. Stay at The Trump. No noise at all. Super new and clean rooms. If you are lucky enough to get an ocean view from the 23rd floor like we had you will appreciate Hawaii's beauty all the more. Spacious everything. The bathroom alone is the size of a small child's bedroom. Equipped with a Japanese made Euro-style washlet toilet and two sinks and a shower where water can go everywhere and noone will care. Room service came twice a day and sometimes more to clean up. They clean your dishes if you cook, like we did a few times, as well as your entire room. The washer and dryer were a great convenience. The only inconveniences were false fire alarms but that happens. Location is awesome because just out the backside on Beachwalk is Henry's which has awesome sorbet and ice cream priced extremely reasonably. The sandwiches are great there too. Back to the Trump. The pool is small as we expected before booking but it is all you need because you will spend you time at the beach. The hot tub or jacuzzi was nice while my son swam and the pool view is wonderful especially when the stars are out at night. No complaints about the pool. Stay at the The Trump Waikiki and you will not regret it. We will be back next year.","Date of stay: June 2013","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The checkin procedure was very smooth and professional, great staff. The suite was well appointed with full kitchen facilities, a large fridge and freezer with ice on demand, the rooms were spotless, 2 bathrooms roomy with lots of towels great water pressure from the showers. Good views of the beach from 2 balconies.
The pool area although small was well kept, plenty of towels and an attendant on call.
Didn't get chance to sample the breakfast or any of the restaurants but I'm sure they will match the property.
Trump Waikiki is about the service, superb in all areas, going to the beach or a day trip? Here's a bag sir, with towels, water, fruit and sun screen, just return when you get back.
The hotel is positioned nicely a short walk to both the beach and the shopping areas.
All in all, a very good hotel, up there in my top 10, it deserves its rating on Tripadvisor I'm sure, but would need to stay in a few more in the area to compare.

- Location:  It is on quieter part of Waikiki and very close to the premium outlet shopping stores.  Any closer into Waikiki it would have been too noisey.  The only issue I had with noise was at the start of our stay we were on the Waikiki side of the hotel and from 7 - 9 the adjacent hotel played loud 80s rock music (Bon Jovi etc) which kept us from awake and ruined some of the romance.  We complained to staff and were upgraded to a suite on facing the park.  No noise and we were fortunate to get a perfect view of the fireworks at the Hilton.

- Room Size: The suites are very roomy with full size kitchen.  I was also impressed with the large bathroom.  We loved the individual shower heads :)

- The complimentary Hawaiian chocolates and coffee

- Buffet Breakfast: Our package included the buffet breakfast which was overall very good.  I was a big fan of the smoothies (my fav. mango & banana :).  The omelettes were also very good.

- BLT Steak:  Very expensive but I would go again.  The Popovers were exceptional!

- Trump Bathrobes are so soft.

- Happy hour beer, Californian rolls and spicy chicken wings at Wai'olu Bar

What could have improved:

- Although staff are very friendly and the service good, it could have improved.  In particular the staff at Wai'olu bar spent most of the time talking to eachother instead of servicing us.

Overall the experience was very good and the hotel provides a very good staff at a reasonable price.","Date of stay: April 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

I do not remember why they do this since my husband was the one who checked us in. Just be aware of this charge since we weren’t expecting it at all. The gym was nice I just would rather see the ocean or the city rather than a wall. It is conveniently located near a lot of restaurants and shops.

We only used the refrigerator for snacks, but if a person wanted to cook, just everything is there.  There is a wonderful ABC store close that has all of the essentials.  The only way I could fault this hotel is the fact that we wanted to make future reservations and the desk clerk was vague, and unwilling to give our travel agent credit for the reservations.

We had spent some time last August at Trump and decided to stay there again for 5 nights and then next 4 nights at the Kahala Resort.

I love staying at Trump Waikiki. It is a unique property. The people who work there are always friendly and make you feel like you belong there. Although not on the water, it is a a short block away and in the heart of the Beach Walk area. We had a car and it was relatively easy (to get around the island) and back to hotel as compared to the more traffic congested central hotel area.

We did use the pool more than our stay last time. Although small it was never crowded and with plenty of shade to sit it was an opportunity to read books and newspapers, take a dip, absorb the sights and sounds of the area from the sixth floor pool area.

While at the Kahala I did miss the convenience of the Trump location to just walk outside and get anything you wanted easily....ABC store, gelato, restaurants, people watching. 

One area which the Kahala won hands down was its breakfast buffet. The food quality, presentation, and service were definitely a notch above Trump.

The hotel was absolutely wonderful; you could not ask for a better experience in Waikiki. However, it was not exactly right for us.

To be completely objective and rate the hotel on its own, it is the most wonderful hotel that I've ever visited.

STAFF:
The entire staff was friendly and helpful from the moment we arrived until the moment we left. There was one gentleman that assisted with valet parking (I wish that I knew his name), but he was particularly helpful. Anytime you left, he was there smiling and ready to assist you in any way possible including route recommendations. When we went to see Iolani Palace, he even provided us quarters for parking (which was great since we didn't know that we would need them).

HOUSEKEEPING:
As I've seen noted in previous posts, I rarely saw a housekeeping cart. I did see housekeepers fairly often on my floor as there was a linen cupboard near my room. It seemed almost as if they were avoiding the guests, as if they shouldn't even be seen. Let me be clear: they were never, ever rude. It just seemed as if they felt like it was best if they did their jobs without a guest ever having to see a housekeeper. I am not used to this, but they did a superb job. Our room was immaculate when we checked in. I can't comment as to the daily service. My husband and I greatly value our privacy while we are on vacation and we are fairly tidy, so we left the Do Not Disturb sign on our door for the entire week. Housekeeping respected our choice for no service and we even got a call from housekeeping to verify that this was not a mistake. They were very thorough!

POOL:
The pool area was very nice. I felt that the water was somewhat chilly except for the late afternoon after the sun has warmed it. My husband thought that it was the perfect temperature, so I suppose it's just a matter of preference. Similarly, the hot tub was the perfect temperature for me but too hot for my husband. 

DINING:
I personally felt that the prices were a little steep. The buffet breakfast was $33.00 per person. There was some variety, but it was not extensive. It was also not particularly good. The eggs were not great (even the omelet left something to be desired). There were only two meat offerings. They also offered a potato option (that day's was boiled baby potatoes sprinkled with some sort of course salt). They had small waffles as well. The rest of the menu seemed to be catered toward their Asian guests and I did not try these items. I ended up trying a few things and ended up with a salad (which was oddly enough also offered on the breakfast buffet). We did not try the restaurant downstairs, as I feared the same sort of disappointment.

LOCATION:
I don't think that you could really beat the location of this hotel. The beach was directly across the street and there were stalls set up for activities rentals. There was a main shopping strip not even a two minute walk from the hotel. Although the term ""shopping strip"" probably doesn't do it justice. There were many stores and restaurants (most are upscale) in this area that really made it so that you didn't have to leave the area if you didn't want to do so.  

The downside of this hotel is really our fault. It was apparent that we did not belong there. If you are visiting Waikiki to shop at upscale stores, visit the oceanfront, and be pampered, this hotel is ideal. We spent most of our time hiking, exploring the island, and searching for some good local foods (there aren't many to be had, FYI). Half the time we came back to the hotel dirty and exhausted, a look that many of the other guests did not have. If you're a young couple going to Oahu for the first time, do yourself a favor and stay on the West Shore near Ko'Olina. It has the most beautiful beach that we saw the entire week and you don't have to fight the traffic to get back to your hotel after a long day.","Date of stay: May 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Even when I changed a couple of things, it was no problem, they took care of it for me.  As a solo traveler, they were very helpful and honest about different spots and made me feel all the more comfortable to be moving about the area on my own.

Couldn't be better!","I have stayed at quite a few high end, luxury 5 star hotels and my Trump experience easily takes first place. We stayed here last year and was highly impressed (hence our decision to come back again, although there were a few less expensive options we were considering for this return trip). Our decision to return was probably the best we made! After 5 days in Maui at the Westin (by all means a decent hotel), it was immediately apparent the difference between the two and I couldn't help comparing the two hotels. I felt bad since the Westin Maui really wasn't all that bad, but having the Trump follow our experience maybe wasn't all that fair to Westin Maui? 

My review below is just a mix of everything we experienced. It could probably be better organized but I'm still on vacation mode and a little lazy :) 

STAFF and SERVICE:
The staff at Trump was BEYOND accommodating and friendly. I have never had such a welcoming staff. I think what stood out was that EVERY staff was this way. There have been other hotels where one unfriendly or unhelpful staff ruin it all for the entire team. Not only were they friendly, every staff member- from the concierge staff to bellhops to housekeeping- were REALLY REALLY friendly and helpful. They always had a smile on their face and often remembered our names! I was deeply impressed with their attentiveness and quickness to respond. For example, one of the night bellhops literally RAN to get our car from the valet parking lot. Of course we wanted our car with as little wait time as possible but we never expected the valet staff to sprint to get our car! I wish I had gotten his name so I could properly thank him! We were delighted to see a familiar face. My husband met Dean last year who gave us so many recommendations on where to eat. We appreciated the recs from a local and loved every one of his recommendations! We were so happy to see him and he remembered us! The only person who we thought could be a little friendlier was one of the servers at the In-Yo cafe. Perhaps because everyone else was SO nice, this server stood out a little. He wasn't very friendly and didn't look like he wanted to be there. When we asked for juice a few times, he didn't respond so we weren't sure if he had heard us or not. He had: he brought our drinks right away but it would have been nice if he had acknowledged our request. 

CHECK-IN:
We were given a free upgrade without us even asking! We got a slightly larger room with a slightly better view. Before arriving we were notified via email that there would be some light construction in the building and we might hear some minor noise during the day (when most people would be out and about anyway). For this minor inconvenience we were offered $100 food and beverage credit for each of the 3 (out of 5) days of our stay. When we arrived to check-in, they gave us the good news that the construction days had been shifted and would only be affected for 2 days. But since they had already offered us $100 for 3 days, they kept the offer and gave us all $300 in credit. And we didn't hear a thing! I can't even tell you when the 2 days of construction took place. We really enjoyed spending the credit on breakfast buffet and room service and drinks and snacks by the pool! $300 (actually $350 because we booked a deal where we were given $50 in food and beverage credit).

ROOM:
The room itself is spacious and I loved the fully stocked, state of the art kitchen. One of the reasons we chose the Trump was that it offered a kitchen. It's nice to have the option of making our own breakfast or snack. The bathroom is huge and offers a double sink. There is a HUGE soaking tub. HUGE! Although I only used it twice, the water pressure is serious and fills the huge tub very quickly. The balcony is designed so that you can avoid any of those awkward moments with your next door neighbors. It is designed so that you can't see into your neighbor's balcony (and they into yours) and can have absolute privacy. There is a small table with 2 chairs. The chairs could be a little more comfortable though. It would be lovely to have some cushioning. I loved sitting out there looking down at the Beachwalk or beyond to the beach but each time I had to come back into the room because the chairs would dig in. The JW has actual sofas in their balcony. How awesome would that be?!?

CLEANLINESS, AMENITIES:
One of the reasons why I would pay extra for a 5 star luxury hotel room is the cleanliness of the room and the amenities it offers. Of course I love the service! But above all, I NEED a clean room. The Trump was beyond meticulous. Every faucet in the bathroom sparkled, beds and tables flawlessly made. The bed... THE BED! We had just spent 5 nights in the Westin where they boast their Heavenly beds. But the Trump bed was the best I have ever slept on! It was just firm as I liked and the sheets were the softest! Getting into bed each night was another indulgent experience. I want to buy the sheets they use. The Westin offers to sell their linens, robes and even beds they use in their rooms. Does the Trump do that? 

The bottles of toiletries was very nice. Most hotels give you the teeniest bottles of shampoo and conditioner. I use a lot of shampoo and by the time I finish with my shower, there's only the teeniest bit left for my husband. And if we decide to take a second shower before housekeeping replenishes our stash, we are in trouble and sometimes have to call down to bring us up a few more bottles. But this was never a problem at the Trump. Their toiletry sizes were generous (probably 2-3 times as large as other hotels!) and generously replenished the next day. I know this may seem minor, but these little attentions to details is what makes the Trump stand out! Also, I rarely saw the housekeeping carts in the hallways. We were in and out of our hotel rooms quite frequently throughout our stay, but now that I think about it, I don't remember seeing the housekeeping cart except 1-2 times. And they even do the rounds twice a day since they offer a turndown service. How do they do it? Amazing! The housekeeping staff is FANTASTIC! I've left dishes in our sink a few times, and when I get back, not a dish in sight. All cleaned and dried and put away. Making the beds and cleaning up after us is a given- all done so well. But again, attention to detail- we left our leis they gave us at check in carelessly tossed on our coffee table. When we got back to our room, we were tickled to see that they had rearranged them into heart shapes. So cute! 

As soon as we walked into our room, we found a bottle of champagne in a bucket of ice (how did they know we were coming? The ice looked fresh!) welcoming and thanking us and congratulating us on our wedding anniversary. Such a nice touch! 

INTERNET:
The hotel offers free wi-fi for their guests. This was the only very minor point of complaint I had. The wi-fi signal worked but was weak so my internet connection was weak and disconnected a few times. I had to use my phone to access the internet a few times because my iPad's internet connection wasn't working too well. 

IN-YO CAFE/ ROOM-SERVICE FOOD:
The breakfast buffet at $34 was a little steep but not unexpected for a hotel dining experience. It was decent. It offered everything that would be expected at a breakfast buffet- hash browns, scrambled eggs, sausage links, fresh fruit, cereal, granola, baked goods, etc. They offered omelets you order as you like as well as a variety of juices, coffee and even smoothies! You also can order oatmeal. I like my oatmeal a little on the mushy side so I had to add more more water to mine when they brought it out. I think they used steel-cut oatmeal because it was still chunky. The baked goods (muffins, croissants, etc) were just ok. Nothing to write home about. The fruit- the papayas were excellent. The others- could be better. They had some Asian inspired stuff like somen, rice porridge and pickled vegetables. The menu seemed to be exactly the same as last year. I think it could use a little variety and change. 

Room-service food was surprisingly good! We ordered it twice. Though the late night dining menu was limited, the two kinds of burgers they offered were excellent. The chocolate mousse crunch cake was probably one of the best I've had!The food was delivered super quick too! From the moment we called in the order to delivery took less than 20 minutes! We normally don't order room service because the price is a little outlandish, but we were able to take advantage of the credit we had. It sure came in handy!

Overall, this second Hawaii Trump experience (and one Chicago Trump experience which was amazing as well) made me a lifelong Trump fan. If the rooms and service are anything like this at the other Trump properties, I know I can rest assured and can expect the best.","Date of stay: May 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

It was a fine stay. Admittedly we arrived mid afternoon and left very very early in the morning the next day so we didnt spend too much time in the hotel. But of the limited time that we did spend in the hotel it was great. 

The staff were wonderful, the room was great too. It was basically like a serviced apartment, so it was very spacious with a bedroom, a kitchen and great sized bathroom. So it was very spacious and if you were going to stay somewhere for maybe a week and didnt want to eat out every night and just wanted to chill in your own room, i think it would be great. I would want a room with a view so it would be enjoyable being in the room on one of the higher floors. I think we were on the 22nd floor. Not sure if all the rooms are the same, you would have to check this out. The pool area was average and the cafe bar area was ok, nothing particularly special.

But the staff were great, room was modern and very clean.

It is a different style of stay. We also stayed at the Halekulani for 3 nights. The Trump is really a  high rise building type accommodation, while the Halekulani is more spacious surrounds around the resort with gardens and pool and several restaurants. So depending on the type of stay you would like, pick one or the other.

I think the Trump hotel was well priced for what we got and also happy to stay here again in the future.","Date of stay: May 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Room was ready before lunch and we were given a free upgrade-the size of the room was huge, also great having cooking facilities in room, the view was amazing.

All the staff were so friendly and helpful that we almost  felt like royality.
We had a very early check in and a very late check out at no extra cost.  They also gave us a free upgrade from a one bedroom premium suite to a two bedroom suite.  Two bedrooms, three bathrooms, three balconies with wonderful views of both diamond head and the ocean.  The suite was very spacious, and equipped with everything to complete a perfect holiday.  Having a washing machine and dryer was a nice bonus, especially after been on holiday for a few weeks.
The trump supply so many little extras that there are two many too mention. 
I have never experienced such wonderful customer service before, not only from one or two exceptional staff but from all the staff.
There is a good gymn with modern equipment.  The pool would be considered small, but has the advantage of length, giving you the rare opportunity to do laps.  It has a lovely ambience to it with lovely views.
The location is nice and quiet, yet just around the corner from shops and across the road from the beach.  There is also a trolley stop outside the hotel which will take you to the main shopping centre for just $2.00.  A taxi will cost around $10.00, tip included.

We arrived late at night after a long, long journey but they made us feel unbelievably welcome and were just so nice. They knew it was a special occasion and without asking they had left some treats in the room which was a nice touch. The room itself (Deluxe Studio Ocean View) was exactly as described and was a great room, just the right size with everything you need, if not more. The internet was free....other big hotel chains should take note! The concierge was helpful with directions and advice and generally all of the staff were amazing. The location is perfect, not on the beach but within seconds walk to it plus the hotel will give you a bag to take to the beach with water, towels, sun cream and fruit - again, a nice touch and typical of the little things you expect from this brand,
We loved it and wouldn't hesitate to stay in this or any Trump again. Worth every penny and I'm sure it's not even that much more expensive than other chain hotels in Waikiki.","Date of stay: May 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Staying here is totally amazing. Shops and restaurants nearby, everybody is genuinely nice. Bottled water everyday on turn down service (we made a mistake of buying 2 liters of water at the ABC store thinking the bottled water is available only on the first night).

You can also ask for super cold bottled water from the concierge before you leave the hotel to wherever you're going.

Concierge and valet welcomes you warmly.

Beach kit is a welcome treat as well.

Sheets and the bedding are the softest.  They send you an email asking for your pillow preference before you arrive too.

We arrived in the morning and was elated to have checked in at that time and ecstatic when we found out we got a fantastic upgrade!

Asked if we were celebrating something on this trip. I said no but my son's birthday is this month.

When we returned on the next day there was a very good chocolate cake waiting for us! Along with a box of Honolulu Cookie Company treats and even popcorn for my teens!!!

Will definitely stay here next time and will definitely recommend to friends. I don't think I can even stay anywhere else!

We only stayed one night, but we are already planning a return visit.

The check-in was fast, warm and friendly.  Almost as on perfect cue, the sun was setting as we checked in.  I can now understand why the lobby is on the 5th floor.  The view is spectacular.

The room was great, with everything you could ask for. We booked the most basic studio level, but received an upgrade to a partial ocean view on a high floor.  We were impressed with the kitchen set up. Even travel mugs and an ice machine. Bathroom was nice with lots of little extra amenities you don’t seem at most hotels, but had some issues with water leaking from shower, and the cleanliness was not perfect.  Tub didn't look sparking enough to take a bath vs. shower, and several large dark long hairs on the white floor.  Yuck! This may seem picky, but this now gets me concerned with cleanliness of rest of room. Everything else seemed fine.

The bed was extremely comfortable (although soft) and the linens were superbly soft and inviting!   Upon arrival we called down for extra bottled water and it was delivered almost immediately (no charge).  

Early the next morning went for a swim in the refreshing lap pool - so memorable. Not sure why people complain about this pool, I thought it was awesome.  Great views. Long and thin, but perfect for early morning laps.  Watched the morning get brighter, and a rainbow, yes, a rainbow appeared.  This doesn't get any better.

On check-out I stopped at the concierge to get some ideas for a colleague that is coming to Waikiki in June.  Even though it wasn't for me, and she wasn't staying at the hotel, I left with a handful of brochures, and the offer that she could call for assistance.  What an amazing service attitude. Valet guys were great too!

The perfect honeymoon!","My husband and I stayed at this hotel for our honeymoon for 2 weeks and I hope this review does it justice as it was absolutely perfect in every possible way. 

From start to finish we were made to feel like VIPs, the staff could not do enough for us. Upon arrival we were greeted with leis, fruit infused water and towels to freshen up. We were also upgraded to a deluxe sea view room. The room itself was great. It was large, clean and so well equipped. Including a coffee maker, blender, rice cooker, etc. We were given sparkling wine, cookies and chocolates throughout our stay. 

I recommend eating at Wai'olu on a Friday night, the food is tapas style and the sushi is some of the best we've had. On Friday's you can watch the fireworks (from another hotel) from this terrace and the live music is fantastic. 

It's the little things that really make this hotel stand out as a cut above the rest. After turn down the radio is always on with Hawaiian music playing, every member of staff greets you with a smile, the beach bags which other reviewers have mentioned, the concierge service is superb, lifts are always ready waiting on the ground floor, more fruit infused water by the pool...

The room was big - we stayed in a deluxe partial ocean view studio, which had its own kitchen. This is a massive drawcard as we could have an amazing self made breakfast on our balcony whenever we woke. The staff were great with our daughter, bringing her some little treats when we arrived and certainly making us feel very special and welcome after a long and tiring flight.

It was a super location for shopping and although it's not on the beach, it was an easy walk and we had a great view of Diamond Head.

I can't speak highly enough of the service, quality and the ""little extras"" that has Trump at the top of the Waikiki Hotel ratings.

Although checkin is at 4pm, our room was ready at noon. The only slight glitch was that, although it was on the 20th floor, it seemed to be a Partial Deluxe Ocean view room (the view was impeded by the ocean front hotels), not the full Ocean view that I had booked. I made a quick call to reception, and we were moved a couple of hours later to a room on the Saratoga side, which had a much better view and was a little larger ... a lot better for the 3 of us. 

Every staff member who we came in contact with had a friendly Aloha, and everything from checkin to checkout was super efficient. The little extras were also a nice touch ... the beach bag, the welcome cake pops and cookies for our daughter, the call from reception 10 minutes after we moved rooms to make sure everything was OK with the new room, the call from the attaché to welcome us to the Hotel, the complimentary Trump beach area and umbrellas  ... these are the type of things that set the Trump apart.

On arrival we were upgraded to 1 bdrm suite with partial ocean view up high, which had nice view South (away from Diamond Head). We were up about 20 floors and higher floors are recommended. 

The room was beautiful, large, and very clean and well looked after. Bathroom and bed were some of the larger we had seen, and additional extras (including bottle of champagne on arrival) all welcomed nd extra touches. The Trump branded everything in the room also was amusing but all products top quality.

Hotel itself is a 10-15 minute stroll from the main restaurants (and maybe 25 minute walk to Ala Moana shopping centre if you fancy it, 5 mins by cab or 10 minute shuttle bus). The distance was handy as after all of the big servings you get it was nice to walk some of it off (the starter at least). Located rIght on the beach also on a quieter spot, and being at the quieter side has its benefits given crowds further up at the main hotels. Plenty of abc stores on doorstop of the hotel.

Concierge and staff were all professional and friendly, and went out of their way to help (with complimentary towels and water to beach, and snack pack etc). 

Breakfast at the hotel was okay if not a bit overpriced (same as spa, however it is a hotel so somewhat expected). Westin, Hilton and Sofitel breakfast buffet have it over Trump in this respect. Gym is fantastic and good equipment, and bar lovely with sunset views and nice ambience. A tip for visitors would be 'eggs n things' which is on the same road as Trump hotel and very local and ridiculous meals, and affordable (12 egg omelette anyone? Think man vs food but very nice).

The only main issue would be price. We got a reasonable rate for our stay from an online website, and given it was a special occassion were happy to pay a little extra. That said, looking at the rates today to plan a trip back in September this year we were shocked - at over $350 a night for basic rates it seems overpriced (and this said having stayed at many similar level hotels around the world). Curiously, when we stayed the hotel was practically empty - we would have put it at 40% capacity at best being generous. It was a ghost town most of the time we were there which we found surprising for such a beautiful hotel. Whilst not giving the place away I am sure there is room on the price to bring more people in.

It is a lovely hotel and we would recommend to others provided you can find a decent rate ($300 or under for studio room with views feels right).","Date of stay: May 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Service is Exceptional","We had made two bookings for our holiday - one at the Halekulani and the other at Trump.  The only reason we were not certain about the Trump hotel was the fact that the hotel is not on the beach.  We decided to go with the Trump booking and cancel the Halekulani and we were very pleased with our decision.  The Trump is practically on the beach and the other aspects of this hotel definitely make up for the perceived advantage some of its competitors may enjoy by being located directly on the beach.  Those on-the-beach hotels were consistently packed with both hotel and non-hotel guests - way too busy to relax - the Trump was less busy and had much more of a relaxing feel to it.

The pre-arrival information from the hotel was useful and allowed us to have some restaurants and tours booked prior to our arrival.  The hotel also organised our airport transfers - we had the same driver for both transfers and he too was very friendly and helpful.

As everyone notes, the service at this hotel is what sets it apart.  Nothing is too much trouble for the staff at this hotel.  The hotel arranged a number of dinner bookings for us at very short notice and also arranged a great morning of snorkelling at Hanauma Bay (highly recommended), again at very short notice.

The service at Trump is probably the best we have experienced from any hotel we have stayed in the world.  It is friendly, relaxed and efficient.  The words ""can't"" ""no"" and ""sorry"" are not part of the vocabulary of the staff at this hotel.  I am sure there must be some sort of capital punishment applied if any member of staff is heard to be using any of those words!  Every staff member we encountered demonstrated initiative in everything they did.

We stayed in a two bedroom suite with den.  The suite was spacious and very well appointed.  Everything we came to need during our stay was there - everything from an ice-cream scoop to a wine stopper!  We had an uninterrupted  view of the ocean from our suite located on the Hilton side and it was brilliant - this is the case for all rooms facing this direction as there is only a park adjacent to the hotel on that side.  As a bonus, you can also enjoy the fireworks display (courtesy of the Hilton hotel) from your deck every Friday night. I think the views from the rooms on the Diamond Head side may be impaired by the many buildings on that side of the hotel unless perhaps you were staying on the very top floors.

The beach bags (with towel, bottled water and fruit) provided each day as you headed off to the beach were great.  Just drop the bags off at the Concierge desk upon your return - no worries.

We also discovered a great little Italian restaurant, Arancino - at 255 Beachwalk Avenue, just across the street from the Hotel on the Daimond Head side - convenient and great food.   

The only minor negative was that there was often a long wait for the elevators and a congestion of guests accumulating in the lobby as a result.

If we returned to Waikiki, I am sure we would not stay anywhere else but the Trump.  The Trump deserves its Number 1 ranking on TripAdvisor.","Date of stay: March 2013","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

From the minute we arrived everything was perfect.  First we got upgraded.  I admit this certainly improves your mood at any hotel but the room was more than we needed and we would have been happy with the room we originally booked.  Room was clean with comfortable bed, great hot water pressure and lots of towels and toiletries. Service was excellent. 

For anyone worried that this is not on the beach I would not let that deter you.  After walking by many of the very crowded hotels on the beach I really appreciated the peace and quiet you find at the trump.  When we went to the beach, which we did often, it is a short walk across the street.  The trump gives you a great bag everyday with towels and a few extras to use on the beach.  And like all the other guest in Waikiki, weather your hotel is on the beach or not, you have to rent chairs and umbrella for the day.

I do recommend walking down to the Hale Koa beach to rent chairs instead of the desk provided by Trump.  The hotel is for military guest but anyone can rent chairs/umbrellas and sit on the beach.  There are fewer hotels on this side and there is more space to spread out. 

We are already planning our return trip this summer.  This time we will be bringing the kids and the trump has several rooms with pull out couches that will be perfect for our children.","Date of stay: April 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We went up to our room to find champaign, chocolates and a letter congratulating us on our marriage. The room was big and beautiful with a kitchen, and a big bathroom (one day I want to renovate my house to have this bathroom). It also had a balcony with the view of Waikiki Beach. As I recall on Friday nights there is a lovely fireworks show that we watched from the balcony it was a perfect spot. We were given a bag of goodies to take to the beach which consisted of towels and fruit which was a nice touch. The staff provided exceptional service even gave us a call to check if we needed anything a couple of hours after check in. When we were leaving they hired a limousine to take us to the airport.

I'd like to say something about the service in this hotel.  From the valet to the front desk to the bellman to the maid service to the bartenders to the restaurant managers and staff we have never encountered more professional and friendly service.

As soon as you get off the cab on the property you are welcomed with friendly smiles, alohas and leis. A staff then personally takes you up to check-in floor. Our room wasn't ready when we checked in so we decided to check out the spa inside the hotel. Keep in mind, like everything else at the Trump, the spa services are quite pricy. (I think it's around $230US for an hour massage per person!)

After our massages, we were informed that our room was ready, and I was blown away when we checked in to our suite. It was very spacious and open, fully equipped kitchen, nice furnishings, spacious living room area, huge bathroom in the bedroom with bath tub, separate shower, and toilet in a closed space, and a separate bathroom behind the kitchen.
Our friends came arrived after us and I realized the difference when I saw their room. It was small, very basic one bed, one bath no kitchen or living room. Sometimes it's worth the extra for extra comfort.

Every interaction with a staff member at the Trump was a pleasant one, they are very friendly and accommodating. Just come across as they love their job. Which is always nice to see.
We went to the beach during the day and when we got back, the room was spotless with plate of delicious chocolate covered strawberries and pineapple shaped cookies. Not sure if every room gets that but it definitely was a pleasant surprise!

The waikiki beach is not right there from the Trump (unlike the Hilton hotel down the street from the Trump), so from the Trump you have to cross the street then walk down for 2 minutes to reach the beach. It's not that far so no biggie. But if you want chairs you can pay for it by the hour at the Trump booth on the beach. Not sure how much they are..  Anyway the sand and water is absolutely beautiful. It was bit windy the 5 days I was there.. but plenty enough sun for us to get a bit of a tan.

The Trump is also only couple blocks away from the shopping area, so we would take a nice stroll in the evenings and check out the shops and restaurants. There are many restaurants on that strip so don't settle for room service or expensive (ex. $16 for a california roll) food at the Trump. I can't remember all of the restaurants we ate at but the Wolfgangs, Gyu Japanese and the Vietnamese restaurant experience was really good. (will do reviews on the restaurants after)

We also went to the Polynesian Cultural Centre, ate the Luau, watched the show and I would say if you have the time, definitely check it out! It's a bit of a drive so if you want something closer, check out the magic show down couple blocks from the Trump (the front desk will help you make reservations). We watched both shows and they were definitely worth it!

Anyway to summarize, nothing is cheap at the Trump, but you definitely get what you pay for. Which is exceptional service. The Trump is an excellent hotel and I can't wait to go back!","Date of stay: March 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Upon check-in we were upgraded to the Trump Floor which has nicer furnishings and just a higher level of finish. The room was truly breathtaking in it's luxury. A full kitchen with very nice cookware, full sized appliances and enough plates and stemware to entertain a good sized party. The staff are probably the nicest, most accommodating people I've ever had the pleasure to meet. Everyone from the desk staff to the small army of individuals who come in for the turn-down service are polite, say hello, and appear to really like their job. Room service was quick and when we were ready to leave (an early flight) the front desk arranged our transportation and had it waiting and had our bags picked up from our room exactly when we asked them to.
The bed were very comfortable, even the fold out couch was comfortable. The master bathroom is palatial and the toilet has a built-in bidet--a  nice, welcome touch.

We arrived the day before but was raining but the hotel was so comfortable that I could just let it be and slept like a baby.  My husband walked to ABC store and grabbed food and drinks for the week.  We heated up the food in the kitchen.  It felt like home.  So relaxing!!!  The sunset and fireworks next day were breathtaking.  It was so romantic.  Then, we walked around Kalakaua, shopped ;), and watched some street artists performed.  All in our flip-flops and shorts.  I wish I could just stay forever.  We really indulged for our anniversary but there was room even if I had brought my family of 5.  I wish this hotel was here when my kids were small, they have washer and dryer inside the unit.  I wouldn't have had to carry all those luggage.  Besides, again the kitchen for the baby food and formulas.

I was told the nearby hotel is also highly rated but I looked.  no comparison because top bucks, we would have gotten a room and not a full apartment.  It's a full fledge apartment setup.

I couldn't have possibly stayed for rest a relaxation beyond the 2 days we were there. Originally we had planned to stop in Maui for 7 nights but decided to break this up so that we could visit Pearl Harbor which is why we booked into the Trump.

A nice greeting complete with Lei's and refreshments was welcomed although I was slightly underwhelmed with the lobby if I'm honest. The room was really nice and spacious, the kitchen was a nice touch but seriously will anyone ever use this beyond the microwave and fridge? A lovely deep bath was good but the walk in shower had issues. There was a faint smell of drains before the scent of soap kicked in and the shower head kept spinning to the side. I left it running whilst in the other room and came back to a swimming floor of water. All the mats and towels were soaking! It took me several minutes to balance the shower head so the direction of water went into the booth rather than out!

There was a discount available on check-in for breakfasts which was worth doing. A fairly nice buffet with great smoothies.

The pool area was ok but could get windy as its located fairly high up. There were no apparent parasols to hide from the sun but you could find shade by moving your chairs around. There was a dedicated person available to help with all requests though along with a chilled water dispenser.

We only tried the breakfast restaurant and the other Japanese themed one on the same floor which I personally didn't rate too highly but the setting was lovely.

The concierge service was very good and they offered a nice beach bag facility full of goodies if you wanted to take the 5 min trip to the beach. We walked down there to take a look and thought it looked a bit crowded and slightly too noisy for our liking.

The location of this hotel is the best reason to stay. It's right in the middle of things and therefore short walks get you to most places you would like to visit.

All in all as I said in my title this hotel is great for short stays, impeccable service but let down by lack of amenities for a R&R long stay vacation.","Date of stay: April 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

There are 4 elevators for the entire hotel (462 rooms, 35 stories) so you are constantly battling to get on elevators.  You are not only competing with other guests but the staff too.  Bellman with full carts, house keepers and office staff use the same elevators.  I was never in an elevator without a staff person present.  They were very friendly of course, but the elevator would stop to let them off or stop to let them on.  When I asked about service elevators for the staff, I was told there was one service elevator which was too crowded and this elevator was ""easier"" for staff to move about the hotel.  I stayed for 10 days in the hotel in room 2310 and it was a very nice room with a partial ocean view.  The hotel is very nice and the room was very quiet.

As expected to Trump standards, top-notch service through out the hotel, from the bellman to the spa etc.  However, I must say, it does not match the service at the Chicago Trump.  I think one of the reasons was that the “Lobby/Concierge” was one floor up from Ground Level, so there was not a lot of personal, frequent interaction.  

The room:
We originally reserved the one bedroom oceanview suite but got upgraded to one bedroom and den oceanview suite.  We had complimentary, famous Honolulu cookies waiting for us (and so the addiction began!) and were welcomed with an amazingly beautiful view from floor 18.  It was wonderful to see the ocean in the morning with my coffee and see the sunset in the evening with a glass of wine.

However, keep in mind that the Trump is ONE BLOCK away from the beach, so our view also had a busy (and noisy) road, a tennis court and a parking lot (with alarms that did not want to turn off sometimes) in view as well that you can see if you are standing on the balcony.  But, it is what it is, if you want the spaciousness, luxury and service of the Trump, the location is a factor you will have to make the most of.  We were not interested in the other non-five star hotels located closer to the beach.
* The kitchen had everything, right down to a toaster and a juicer!
* The shower was okay.
* The in-room dining was tasty, especially the flatbread!
 
Other:
* The gym was not “state-of-the-art”.  It has like 5 treadmills, 4 ellipticals, a couple of bikes and some free weights, but overall, small and view-less, however, it was hardly busy with patrons, so it got the job done.
* After walking through our “second-choice”, the Halekulanai, I did like their “Hawaiian feel” with the dinner buffet, live singing and dancing, I realized that the Trump was definitely more of a “business” hotel without a “resort” feel.

And while there is no official way for me to keep the tally, it is definitely an ""I know it when I see it"" evaluation.  Without hesitation, I can affirm what other reviewers have already indicated and that is that this property excels in all areas.  The property itself if perfectly situation just off the beach but next to a park so that there are unobstructed views to the west/northwest which makes for great sunset viewing.  The location is close to lots of restaurants/shopping and is right on a trolley line if you want to venture farther out from the main tourist district.  The rooms are tastefully decorated and spacious with all of the modern amenities you would expect from condo-style units.  Housekeeping did an excellent job, including providing fresh toiletries, extra towels (my group always seems to use double the norm) and evening turn-down service without request.  The lobby level restaurant had great pu-pus and made a mai-tai that is the best I have tasted on four continents (yes- it was really that good).  And the cherry on top is the excellent service exhibited by everyone from the valet, to concierge, to front desk personnel, to wait staff.  Everyone was very friendly (without being overly so) and helpful with any needs that arose.  Whomever has trained the staff has obviously put a premium on guest service and it truly shows in the conduct of the employees.  
The only drawbacks I could find is that the bathroom set-up was somewhat awkward with a lack of doors/windows in the shower area.  And to be clear, this is a hotel really designed for adults.  It is not as though the hotel cannot accommodate children (the hotels boasts a kids program and even thoughtfully provided snacks and a welcome letter to the teenager in my group).  If you are looking for a grand pool with lots of deck space for sunbathing and expansive water fun, then you are going to be disappointed.  The pool/pool area is small; think two lane lap pool, but not as long.  I know beautiful Waikiki beach is steps away, but sometimes a little sand-free time at the pool is nice especially with complimentary wi-fi throughout the property.  You can literally see the very large pool at the Embassy Suites next door while you are on the pool deck of the Trump.  If you are a pool person, then be ready to face the disappointment.  Also, contrary to some other reviewers' experiences, I heard a lot of street traffic noise in my 11th floor room.  But, notwithstanding what I would consider minor issues, this hotel is a great choice from tip to tail.  When returning to Waikiki, I would not even look for another hotel. I would simply book my room at Trump Waikiki and know that I would be making the correct decision without question.","Date of stay: March 2013","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

It is true that you get the beach bag with water, sunblock towels and fruit each day and the beach is literally across the street. Don't listen to anyone who says the beach is not convenient. You could stay at the hotel across the street and be on the back side of it and be just as far from the beach as we were and the one across the street is a beachfront property. I can assure you that those guests are not treated like TRUMP guests. If I'm ever in Honolulu again this will be my first choice is a hotel stay... Thanks for making our trip memorable..

The city is filled by 70s type of hotels and decorum, so trust me-- this is the best hotel on the island.  Apparently the TRUMP was originally intended to be condos, but were converted to hotel rooms when the real estate market soften.  

It's staff is very friend and unpretentious.  We had a wonderful suite that had a large, comfortable (1) bedroom with two large bathrooms on opposite sides of the room.  The best feature was probably the kitchen, not a kitchenette, but a true kitchen with Wolf appliances, granite countertops and fully stocked cabinets of silverware, plates and glasses.  Most people would be proud to have this type of kitchen in one's own house.  It came in handy on days when we didn't feel like going to eat dinner.  The high end refrigerator was very appreciated.  There is a Whole's Food grocery story (not walking distance though).

We stayed on a high floor and the views were great (see the associated pictures).  

The location is great.  You can walk to the beach in about 5 minutes or your can walk to the end shopping in about 5-8 minutes too.

A great restaurant option is the Ocean Club (5 minutes walk from the hotel) and it is on the beach.

Again, you can't go wrong with this hotel.  To give you my standard, I define ""nice"" as the Ritz in Wash DC, the Grand Del Mar in San Diego or Lowes Hotel in Atlanta.","Date of stay: March 2013","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

One of the best city hotel experiences I've had in a long time.

Booked a 2-bedroom unit directly from one of the residential unit owners.

Huge rooms, meticulously appointed and maintained, great views, friendly and thorough service. Little bathrobes and little slippers for the kids. Nice beach totes for excursions.

I don't agree with the ""They have no sense of place"" commentary. Being a new property it sure doesn't reflect the Don Ho Waikiki, but I think it represents the modern, cosmopolitan, pan-Pacific version of Waikiki with a great Aloha spirit. All of the staff members we met were from in-state, sharing their school memories as they greeted our ukulele-carrying kid. Compares very well to the other large hotels in the area, which are often staffed by folks from the Mainland.

For a taste of old, pre-highrise Waikiki, though, head out the back of the hotel onto Beachwalk for fruits and homemade ice cream at Henry's Place. You won't regret it.","Date of stay: April 2012","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

This hotel is planted a small beach walk hop to the beach, as mentioned, the hotel provides an equipped beach bag.  The beach segment that you land on is next to the Outrigger Reef (fun and affordable beach options), a park,  a shave ice stand, beach rental stand (chairs umbrellas, etc $35 a day), and affordable food options (a wonderful 6.99 made to order steak lunch plate for an example).  
   Trump is located in the heart of of it all.  Walk out the door left, beach, right, high end shopping, a block over (Lewers St.) a plethora of restaurants from a Dennys and Subway to mid range and higher end options.  There is an ABC a short walk away for affordable snack options, beach mats (2.99) and sundries.  Since Trump comes with little kitchens, this ABC came in handy.  I'm happy in the morning with coffee and toast, happier if I'm not paying room service prices for it.
   Worth mentioning, Trump has a Mai Tai that won first place in THE international Mai Tai contest.  It's $15 in the lovely park side/ocean view lounge.  It's worth every penny.   This is where you spluge.  There is also a happy hour at this location with amazing bar food options at a great price.  The Mai Tai does not get marked down with happy hour, doesn't matter, go for it.
   Again, I won't gush about the hotel, enough have already.  It's the service that makes the place, and simply, this what a high end hotel should be.   The hotel did not disappoint one bit. 
   The pool is small, yes, however elegant and we enjoyed a relaxing afternoon by it.   While you're in the infinity pool you're hanging high gazing over the Pacific.  Sunscreen, magazines, fruit infused water all complimentary.  Life is good here.

Had dinner at BLT & was a little disappointed. The lobster was so small. After 3 mouthfuls it was gone. The pannacotta tasted very grainy but the flavour was good. 
as other reviewers have said the staff are excellent. We booked a few tours through concierge. I would recommend the shopping outlets. Had some good sales on whilst we were there. 
Try to arrange a time for housekeeping to suite you as our cleaner was usually knocking on the door around 9am, usually just when we were getting dressed. I figure when on holidays it's my time to sleep in.

We reserved a one bedroom suite with a partial ocean view.  The hotel is located on one end of waikiki across the street from the Embassy Suites, Outrigger Reef and close to the Sheraton and the Hilton Hawaiian Village.  The hotel is 2 blocks from Kalakaua Ave (the Rodeo Drive of waikiki) and boasts many high end stores such as Gucci, Coach, Louis Vuitton, etc in addition to many many restaurants.
Upon arriving at the hotel we were greeted with leis and escorted to the lobby located on the 6th floor.  At check in we were provided fruit infused water and cold towels to freshen up.  Our hotel room was absolutely breathtaking.  The suite was spacious, comfortable and had a fully stocked kitchen.
The Trump Attache service called to check in to make sure everything was ok with our room and reminded us to give them a call if we needed anything.  Shortly upon getting to the room our luggages were brought up in addition to a box of honolulu cookies as a welcome gift.
Housekeeping comes twice a day once in the early afternoon to clean the room and once in the evening for turn down service and provides water bottles at bedside.
The concierge service provides complimentary beach bags filled with towels, sunscreen, water bottles, and fruits for a trip to the beach.  
Every employee we interacted with during our stay was stellar and did their utmost to ensure we were well looked after.
As far as attractions, there are many to choose from and convenient to get to from waikiki.  The 23 bus takes you from right in front of the hotel to Diamond Head for a hike up to the top.  I also suggest booking some tours to see Pearl Harbor and the numerous natural bays, historical sites, and lookout points.
There are 90 hotels in waikiki so I can imagine the intimidation when deciding on a hotel, however this is by far the best hotel we have ever said at and have become trump loyals.

WRONG!  We had a fabulous time!","Reading some reviews after booking the hotel for our recent trip, I nearly canceled the reservation thinking it wasn't fit for families.  So glad we decided to stick with it because Trump Waikiki and staff goes above and beyond to make children feel welcomed.  By now you've read that upon arrival, you are greeted with leis and shell necklaces, then on the lobby floor, with water and cold towel.  Excellent touch.  As everyone else shared, beach bags stocked with water and fruit were also extremely appreciated.  What I want to focus this review on is the ""little things"" they did to pre-empt your asks and make your stay even better!  

First, my son loved the seal stuffed animal and activity set upon arrival in the room.  The fruit plate was also very much appreciated.  He loved having his own robe and slipper (adorable touch!) along with mommy and daddy's.  What was most impressive was that they even gave us a stool in the bathroom to help him reach the sink...not even Disney Aulani did that!

The pool is not your typical large, resort pool, but it actually was quite well designed for kids, with plenty of shallow ""landing"" areas for young ones to soak their bodies.  The fact that it wasn't a deep or large pool make it easy for you to stay close to your children, whether you're next to the pool, or in the hot tub.  Very few guests were in the pool when we were there (most were tanning) so our son and other kids enjoyed their time in there.

Every time we got inside the car, every door was held open, and everyone offered to help with directions.  When it was pouring, we were given very nice umbrellas to carry along, and they also made sure to cover us while we walked to the car.  The staff members all stopped to say hi whenever my son wanted to chat with them. 

The hotel is just a few steps from Eggs n' Things and several delicious Japanese restaurants (through back alley).  And 2 blocks away, you'll find yourself in the heart of Waikiki with tons of shops, restaurants and tourists.  The beach immediately in front of the hotel (cross the street) is a bit rocky but make a left turn, walk a bit more, you'll find yourself in much softer sand.  For us, that wasn't a big deal at all to walk in the water a bit!  Why would it be? The weather is gorgeous!

As a family, we had to stock up on milk, snacks, cereal, juices, etc.  The kitchenettes came in SO handy!!  We loved having a kitchen in a luxury hotel (versus having to rent an old condo).  Balconies were huge too which made it easy for my husband and I to sneak out and enjoy some wine while our kid sleeps.  The housekeeping was meticulous-- twice a day, and anything you used in the kitchen, is washed immediately or refilled.

If you need reservations for dining, don't even hesitate to use the Attache service.  They truly take care of you! They also installed a Wii in our room since we have a little guy.

It was a fantastic stay! The staff here are remarkably friendly, and very attentive to every need. The hotel itself while not on the beach, is only a couple minute walk to the beach. One of the nice surprises was that the hotel provides a beach bag that has sunblock, towels, water and fruit. My wife and I did rent a car, but in retrospect it probably wasn't needed. Even when we went to the Polynesian cultural Center and North Shore area, we took a a shuttle tour that was available directly through the PCC. I highly recommend that by the way. The valet fee is a little excessive, I actually prefer to park my own car, but it was nice not have to look for parking in the busy Waikiki Beach area. 

For anybody looking to stay at the Trump Hotel, I can definitely say you will not be disappointed. It did feel just a bit formal for a beach vacation though. I think next time we may try the Outrigger, or even the Royal Hawaiian.

We've been staying at the Hale Koa since I retired but this year we hadn't planned to go to Hawaii.  Then schedules changed so I went shopping for an alternative (you schedule a year ahead at the Hale Koa).  I was surprised when shopping that the Trump was price competitive with some of the other well known properties we've stayed at in the past.  We had watched it being built.  As many have noted, the service - housekeeping, restaurants, pool and on - was outstanding.  I don't recall as many people who seemed to be happy, not only to help, but to be working there.

We had a very nice room.  Very nice to have a kitchenette since we usually end up with leftovers and it made it easy to take care of them.  Very nice bath - probably the best we've seen since a trip long ago to Bali.  Our city view room had as good a view of the ocean as many of the partial-ocean views elsewhere.

The lobby/lounge area on the 6th floor is very nice.  We enjoyed the happy hour specials.  If you are there on Friday, at 7:45 PM there's a fireworks display over at the Hawaiian Village.  The lounge/restaurant provides a view, probably better than on-site.

The location is great if you want access to a (relatively) quieter part of the beach.  It's close to Lewers street with restaurants and of course the host of shops in Waikiki.

All that said, this is a condotel, not a resort.  That means it doesn't have a massive pool area, it isn't on the beach, it doesn't have a sweeping lobby, it doesn't have shops.  It also doesn't have resort fees.","Date of stay: March 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

When we first arrived, we were promptly greeted by the valet attendant, bellmen, and a welcome receptionist. It felt like a red carpet treatment as they gave us a rundown of the hotel services. From there, everything else was smooth sailing. Service at this hotel was excellent. Everyone was on their A game and we were promptly greeted by all members of the staff. 

We were given a deluxe studio room, and it were generously sized. There was a small kitchen with supplies if we wanted to stay in and cook. The bed was one of the most comfortable beds that I have slept on. An infinity pool with a city view was a great feature. It wasn't too crowded, so we were able to swim without running into other people. Overall, I can see why this hotel is rated #1 on TripAdvisor. 

My only complaint would be breakfast at In-Yo. For $32 breakfast buffet per person, it was so-so. The food was limited and did not feel like a 5 star breakfast. Even though the price is much less than other 5 star buffets, I expected more from a 5 star hotel. This is the only reason I give the hotel 4.5 stars. I would have paid more for better food options & quality. 

Definitely recommended.","Date of stay: March 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I prepaid the Deluxe Studio ocean view for a 5-night stay, but when we arrived, we had been upgraded to a 1 bed room ocean view suite.  The suite was well appointed and had a superior refrigerator-freezer.   My Lady really enjoyed the suite, as did I.

Trump provides all of the services I could expect, and excels at it.  Overall, the staff at this hotel is exceptionally well trained; probably the best that I’ve encountered to-date. 
 
Unfortunately, we encountered a plumbing problem … our toilet was making a disturbing noise which was reported.  A maintenance person came to repair it and replaced the flapper valve.  Within 24 hours, we were experiencing the same disturbing noises.  We reported it again as we were about to check out.  Hopefully, the next guests didn’t have our problem. 

The fact that the toilet plumbing issue, which was disturbing, was not resolved with the first repair attempt is why Trump International did not earn a 5 star rating from this reviewer.

We had an oceanfront balcony room that was a highlight each morning and evening, to start the day or end the day, I would highly recommend budgeting for an oceanfront balcony, after all you have spent to go to Hawaii and travelled all this way, why not spend that small difference, it will be worth it in the end.

I would highly recommend this hotel to any and all friends.  It is 1 block off the beach, very quiet at night in the hotel as well as the street around it.

This is my husband and my second time staying at the Trump with the first being our honeymoon. This time around we decided to bring our parents and sibling along on both sides for a relaxing and memorable experience in this wonderful island to share with them the great memories we had during our first time here. We can't say it enough, the Trump did not disappoint! from the smooth check-in where we immediately got pampered by cold towels and refreshing drink, I learned from front desk that the room where my husband and I were staying in was upgraded from a partial ocean view deluxe room to a TWO BEDROOM SUITE! I was pretty happy about this because I actually told my husband at the plane that from all the places where we've traveled so far, we have never experienced being upgraded so to me, this was a big deal and a very ""suite"" deal at that (forgive the pun). With that aside, the whole family felt like we were all cared for and treated well. The staff really shines with the service they provide. We even got home one night to find a box of Honolulu cookie company on the counter with a note of thanks for choosing to stay at this hotel again. To me, if we have found a great place from the first time, we don't hesitate to come back the second time around as we tend to remain loyal to the hotel based on the wonderful experience we had. I cannot say enough about the impeccable service this place provided along with a stunning accommodation that left us feeling the need to come back once again. It was as if all the driving and sightseeing we did for the day was met with the most comfortable and luxurious atmosphere back to our rooms. It was an oasis really, of soft, personalized pillows, the softest bed, and the little touches such as a cool bottled water and slippers ready to tuck you in after a long day being tourists. Yes, as most reviews had mentioned about the place being on the expensive end, with that said however, it is always the quality of the service and the accommodation that should be considered. For the price one pays to stay at this place is equally met with the great satisfaction of experiencing being treated like a welcomed and valued guest. Please keep on doing what you do Trump Waikiki! You have once again given us yet another reason to return someday. Mahalo and Aloha!","Date of stay: February 2013","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We very much enjoyed the Wai'olo Ocean View Lounge and came here for drinks and hors d'oeuvres several times during our stay. We also loved that the hotel has as part of its free services a ""beach/tourist"" bag for each guest every time you go somewhere, that includes cold water, fruit, beach towels, and sunscreen- it is much needed for any touring or beach visits. The rooms are incredible, we stayed in a one bedroom condo which had plenty of room to accommodate at least two couples and had two full baths, a washer/dryer, three flat screen tv's a ""desk/lounge"" area with a sofa bed, in addition to a full living room and fully equipped kitchen, plus balconies and seating areas off both living room and master bedroom. Also I should note that the main bedroom area has a door which separates it and one of the bathrooms plus laundry area from the rest of the condo, and that provides a lot of privacy if more than one couple is staying there. All in all the living area is one of the most beautiful I have experienced.
The hotel is located just a block from the main shopping area, and you could lose yourself there for more than a day, just experiencing all the stores and shopping. There are a ton of restaurants as well. We really love Japanese food so we went to several of the katsu restaurants very near by to the hotel. Several reviews have mentioned the eggs n things restaurant and I think you have to go there at least once just because it is a great exerience and a treat to get the pancakes and an omelette. After that, we went to Denny's which is pretty much next door, as we are low key breakfast people. Denny's is also wonderful, really nice people and great breakfast food.
I have to agree with the people who said this feels more like a business hotel given its location in Waikiki. We went to the nearby beach one time and we were pretty shocked at just how small, crowded, and overall junky it is. If you plan on going there, have a backup plan for when you decide to leave 10 minutes later. When we were there, the rocks and gritty sand in the water hurt our feet a lot, not to mention the cigarette butts and other debris floating around us. There is hardly a free patch of sand and people are right up next to each other. Plus if you want to rent an umbrella, it is very expensive. Also there are people walking around with exotic birds that you can take your picture with- I found this tacky and cruel. 
We had most fun when we picked up our car rental and could drive around the island and enjoy the beaches on the other side. We made sure to go to the shrimp trucks and we managed to see the filming of an episode of Hawaii Five-0 which was pretty fabulous. You have to go to Leonard's bakery for the malasadas. We walked there but it took an hour each way so plan on driving lol. We enjoyed Mike's Huli huli chicken and a smoothie that was out of this world. There are tons of good reviews about the food so I will go back to the hotel review :-).
We found the pricing for room cleanup, hotel food, in-room movies, somewhat prohibitive. If you are not very wealthy, don't come here. As soon as we got the car we went to the grocery store and bought food. This made it possible for us to do a lot more, but still we missed being able to eat out as much as we wanted. I had been to the Kahala Hilton in Diamond Head years ago and back then I felt it was expensive. When we came here I thought ""it won't be like last time, now I have money."" Let me tell you, it isn't about having money, it is about the value in return for your money. 
On to the last part, which is the hotel pool. My husband and I were mystified as to why a hotel that does not have any kind of reasonable beach, would put in such a tiny pool and sunbathing area. I strongly feel the hotel needs to reconsider this and do SOMETHING to make it better. The pool area is several floors up, and its location also causes it to experience severe tradewinds which make sunbathing difficult at various times of the year. A lot of people complained about children in the pool, I did not experience any problems with this. It is simply that the entire pool is about the size of two half-laps and seating is both very limited, and only on one side. 
I definitely agree that coming here does not give one the feeling of a ""Hawaii"" experience. It is much more akin to being in Chicago and going to Oak Street Beach, as it has such a large city feel. We found that at the end of the day we had city-grit in our hair and on our faces. Of course we were there in early December and there were indeed tradewinds. I recommend to anyone visiting here, to do a lot of research before deciding to come, and make sure this is a good fit for your idea of a Hawaii vacation. 
Having said all this, I must emphasize that the hotel staff are incredible, the hotel itself is incredible (not counting the pool), and if you are looking for a big-city type experience where you enjoy a lot of people traffic, high end shopping etc. then this is the place for you. While we enjoyed our stay, I would choose the Big Island next time just because that is a better fit for me and my husband. 
Finally, I am giving the hotel three stars instead of four because I believe the price is too high for the value in return. I would give it four stars if the pricing were just a little bit more reasonable. This is not a place where you will feel comfortable ordering drinks and food at the pool every day unless you have money to burn.","Date of stay: December 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

I liked how they brought refreshments to you when you checked in along with beautiful shell leis for the females/girls and kukui nut leis for the males/boys.
The hotel has a sleek, modern feel that is quite unlike many of the hotels in Waikiki. In our rooms there was a lovely stuffed seal for each of the kids along with two cake pops and an activity book and a personalized card welcoming them. They loved this! We enjoyed the Hononluly cookies and chocolates. The beds were comfortable and had very nice linens. We didn't use the kitchenette but it seemed well-equipped. We were given restaurant vouchers to use at the onsite restaurants during our stay. It made for a very reasonably priced brunch for 8 people the next morning. I thought the pool was going to be a disappointment for my kids because it isn't the big sprawling resort pool that they might have imagined however they loved that it was a few stories up and they could look down to the streets below. The other thing I really liked were the beach bags that you could get to take to the beach that included sunscreen, towel, water, and fruit. That was a lovely little perk! Since we had a late flight, they accommodated us with a room to use until about 7pm so we could leave our bags in there and freshen up after going to the beach and pool.

We had the least expensive room, the ""Vacation like a Trump"" special, and it was lovely.  We requested a kitchen and lanai, if available, and we got a lovely room with a partial ocean view.  Everything was tasteful: lovely art, attractive bathroom and kitchen cabinets and handles,  marble floor in the bathroom.  The bed was delightfully comfortable with delicious sheets, a great reward after a long flight.
The hotel provides a ""beach bag"" of  towels, sunscreen, fruit and water to take to the beach.  At the pool, there is always a decanter of water lightly flavored with  the fruit that is in the container. Also sunscreen available at pool along with the nice thick towels.
The concierge was incredibly helpful, particularly helping us get to the wonderful Honolulu Museum of Art.
Only had one light meal at the attractive, open air restaurant-lounge on the lobby level.  Extremely pleasant and delicious shrimp tacos with good salsa verde.  Inexpensively priced wine during cocktail hour.
Finally, the last best thing, which was really just luck:  On the day we left we had a 9:30 PM flight to New Zealand.  They let us stay in our room until 7:00 PM.

With that being said it was an amazing deal.  However, I know most people are booking straight with the hotel and that's my only concern.

The studio was average - 400 sq ft..  We have a partial ocean-view which was nice.  Couldn't cook anything in the kitchen as the smallest studio doesn't have a stove top.  But you can utilize the fridge and microwave.  The decor was ok.  I've stayed in many nice properties and I didn't really feel like I was staying in luxury but look at the pictures and decide for yourself.  I think that's a personal choice.  

I deducted one point for the bathroom.  It only had one sink so it was hard to place your toiletries.  There is only one bar for towels which contain your big towels to dry off with so you don't have a spot to put your hand towel after you've washed your hands.  The shower doesn't have a curtain but a half slab of glass so we had to use a big towel on the floor to catch the water which meant we always had to call housekeeping for more towels.  

My favorite thing was the bed.  Bed felt heavenly and I slept like an angel every time!

The staff was really friendly.  Drinks didn't knock my socks off and food was pretty good.  Location is great and they give  you a beach bag with  towels, water, apples and suntan lotion which is very nice and helpful.  If you can go through Jet Luxuries go for it! 

Not a bad property just isn't worth the normal price tag and didn't feel all that luxurious to me.  I thought Trump would know better!

The staff - from the concierge to the lounge to the cleaning staff - make you feel welcome and are happy to help out.  Our room was impeccably cleaned, with twice daily service.  

As noted in the other reviews, the hotel is located about a block off the beach and has a very small pool.  However, we found it quite relaxing and quiet.  Definitely not hectic like some of the other Waikiki hotels I have stayed in (Hilton, Surfrider, etc.).  The hotel is, however, well located and you can easily access the beach to the east and west.  It was nice not to be fixed at one end of the beach.  There are also lots of amenities nearby - stores, car rental, shopping and restaurants.   

Our room, a studio with partial ocean view, was comfortable and had lots of space.  My only criticism is that there is not much drawer space to unpack, but the rest of the suite was luxurious.  The kitchenette was well stocked and easy to use - very practical if (when) you get tired of eating out in restaurants all week.  We headed out to the Whole Foods and picked up great breakfast and snack food to enjoy on our patio.  The twice-daily room attendants even help with the dishes!

Beach bags are available at the concierge before heading out and were a nice touch - towels, sunscreen, water and fruit.","Date of stay: January 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The concierge, house keeping, bellman and even the Attache team who called us in the room to make sure we are enjoying our stay. They even took note of my wife's birthday and sent chocolate and flowers toi the room. They make you feel welcome from the get go. If you like the option of cooking your own meals this hotel is for you, with rooms coming with spacious kitchens,
My family and I booked a 2 bd suite with ocean view, this was upgraded upon arrival and the room was fantastic. Yes, the pool is small and there is only a couple of restaurants on site compare to the other resorts in waikikki. But you're in Hawaii to sit on a beach not spend your days there by the pool, also the location of this hotel is central to many decent restaurants and shops. The concierge even pack a complimentary beach bag with towels, sunscreen, water and fruit for you day at the beach. Now thats service.
One thing I love about this hotel is they don't charge you wifi access unlike many other 5star hotels. this is conveniant especially if you want to maintain contact with home overseas.

I like to think that when she got a little older (and wiser), she decamped to the Trump in Waikiki.  If I could live anywhere, this would be the place!  We just completed our third stay at this amazing hotel in Waikiki, and cannot say enough about our consistently incredible experiences there. To a person, day or night, from the valet to reception to housekeeping, the staff was genuine, welcoming and thoughtful.  They attended to every detail, from the delivery of bags to our suite to the bottle of water sitting at our nightstands to helping us find a local restaurant, the name of which we could not recall.  The one bedroom/den suite still takes my breath away.  A gorgeous, meticulously-outiftted kitchen....down to a rice cooker!  Coffee, teas, Honolulu Cookie Company shortbread cookies and a sweet welcoming note from the property's manager.  An enormous Carrera marble shower, bath and double vanity with the best-smelling bath products, and a constantly replenished supply of white towels in every size, including huge bath sheets.  A much, much welcomed stackable washer and dryer so that we did not go home with suitcases full of dirty clothes.  Two (TWO!) balconies with stunning Waikiki beach views, including a fireworks display this trip.  The Trump is walking distance to stunning beaches, fantastic restaurants, and world class shopping.  We have traveled and stayed around the world, but the Trump Waikiki is a standout - posh, peaceful, and pleasurable.  We emphatically recommend it and are already plotting our 2014 return.","Date of stay: February 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We spent 5 nights here and were truly sad to leave. 

The location is slightly away from the main Waikiki hotels located on the beach, but in a way that is nice to be slightly removed from the hectic atmosphere of that area.

The room (Deluxe studio with ocean views) was spacious with its own kitchen which was handy for breakfasts and lunch when you don't want to head out.

The staff at the concierge were terrific in helping arrange tours and rental cars etc, they exceeded expectation in every way. In general the staff are the friendliest and most welcoming at any hotel I have stayed at.

The beach bags available at the concierge were a nice addition as it's often hard to pack beach towels in already packed suitcases. The day spa and the restaurants were all of high quality. Thinking back on it, there is really nothing I can fault about this hotel.

So why not five stars?

1. The lifts are infuriatingly slow.
2. The breakfast buffet is very average and the restaurant area is cold and uninviting.
3. The pool is laughably small.
4. The gym is too small.
5. The spa is very basic.

It seems that the developers of this property, in trying to squeeze every last square metre into the rooms, skimped badly on the space they allocated to guest amenities. 

That said, I'll probably visit Trump Waikiki again.  Waikiki is sadly lacking in great hotels, and its really nice to have a spacious apartment, with kitchen facilities when I'm on an extended holiday.","Date of stay: January 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

I enjoyed it so much that I'm heading back there again in 4 weeks from now. 

It started with us arriving quite early and the hotel staff giving us a 'temporary room' for a few hours until our room was ready. I was sad to leave the temporary room as I thought we'd surely be stepping down ... how I was wrong. We were upgraded, without request or any notice, to one of the biggest hotel rooms I've stayed in. It was the 2br suite with ocean views and den. For a first time guest I was very lucky. The kitchen is exceptionally good for a hotel. Clearly they don't discourage people from bringing in heaps of food as the fridges we saw were very big. The wholefoods market is a cab ride away but great for setting yourself up for the week with some nice eat-in meals (if that's what you want).

The facilities are all great; the hotel's cleanliness is faultless. The poolside service is also quite good. 

This time around I even booked the same type of room we were upgraded to just because I know how good it was. The pricing is justifiable for the quality of the hotel and services.

All in all a wonderful stay, hence the return trip.","Date of stay: March 2012","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I've traveled a lot on business and leisure. The bed is luxurious. Location is perfect. Not by the water so that not too noisy. Staff is courteous. There's a kitchenette with all utensils so that u can prepare your own food. Hall ways are so clean and smell so nice and refreshing. Wifi is fast. There is a mini library. Amenities in the room are excellent. It is nothing but luxury. You can ask a beach bag with water, fruits and towels plus sun screen whenever you go out to beach. 
My only complaint is house keeping. 
I stayed there for five nights. I washed my hair and I have left over shampoo. I didn't throw away the half used shampoo since I hate wasting. It is almost done and housekeeping could see it. I thought they'd put second bottles as many girls do. I had to shampoo my hair on day 5 wih left over which is not enough for my hair. I am not crazy about hotel shampoos since I use Aveda(r) at home. But ...lack of refills by housekeeping ruined the day with not so clean hair.

We decided to book this hotel after researching many hotels in the Waikiki area.  We could not have made a better choice!  

Upon arrival, we were greeted by the valet staff, Dean (the main Bellman), and Julia (hostess).  The luggage from our rental car was taken out and tagged immediately to be sent to our room.  We were given beautiful leis and were escorted to the check in desk.  While checking in, we were given pineapple infused water and cool towels to freshen up.  

We stayed on the 14th floor in a one bedroom studio.  Although the room was the smaller and simpler room type, we were amazed by the ""basic"" amenities it included.  Hawaiian music was playing in the room once we opened the door, and a box of Honolulu Cookie Company cookies were on the desk to welcome us.  

The kitchen appliances included: refrigerator (with ice maker), microwave, touch screen stove, and stainless steel sink.  The kitchen accessories were endless: coffee cups, wine glasses, champagne glasses, plastic cups, short glass cups, tall glass cups, small plates, medium plates, large plates, small bowls, large bowls, food storage containers, coffee maker, forks, spoons, knives, blender, rice cooker, pots, pans, measuring cups, glass pitcher, hand mixer....... everything you could possibly need in a kitchen!

The bathroom was amazing.  All marble flooring and counter tops.  We really enjoyed the deep tub and shower. 

Housekeeping was top notch.  There are two services per day.  First service to clean the room and replenish any items/towels needed.  Second service as a bed turn down service around dinner time to remove extra pillows and turn out the sheets to get you ready for bed.  Each night, they provided us complimentary bottled water by the bed as well.  

The staff really made our experience the the Trump wonderful.  Julia would greet us by name, and Dean would always make a point to ask us what we were doing each day while we got our car from valet.  He was always happy to provide directions and suggestions.  The whole valet staff and hotel staff were also very friendly and helpful.

The day before leaving Waikiki, we informed the hotel our flight would not leave until 11 at night.  We inquired about having the hotel hold our bags.  They immediately offered a late check out for us.  Typically, late check out would be 1 or 2 in the afternoon.  They actually set up the late check out for 9 at night!

Honolulu is heaven on earth and The Trump is the perfect place to stay!

Hotel arrival
Entrance is beautiful. Reception is on the sixth floor. When we arrived, weekly Friday night fireworks were about to start. We grabbed a cocktail, and stayed on the balcony for the perfect view. Friendly and quick check in, great service

Room
We booked a studio room city view through Jet Luxury resorts and got an awesome deal. The room is not huge but it had everything we could want - comfortable bed with all white sheets, balcony with partial ocean view, tv with DVD, iPod/iPhone docking station, kitchenette with fridge, microwave, coffee maker and dishes! Beautiful shower and sink. Modern and simple very clean. We even arrived to a box of Hawaiian short bread cookies which I will definitely be bringing back for friends and family. Perfect room for us!

Pool
Much smaller than anticipated....BUT it's on the sixth floor so no ransoms from other hotels nth is is huge because as you walk through other hotels in Waikiki you find you can just walk into their pools and there's aren't really that much bigger. I found that although our pool was small most the time you want to be at the beach so it's a small sacrifice for such a modern hotel. 

Location 
Is PERFECT! You are in the heart of everything. We walked to breakfast just around the corner from shopping and the park. Quick walk to the beach. Across for. The Halekulani for brunch. It's right in the heart of it all without being too chaotic like some of the other hotels.

All in all this is a great hotel and I will be back! Honolulu is the ideal marriage of beach and city , relaxation and fun, nature and luxury. I'm sold on the Trump!","Date of stay: January 2013","Trip type: Traveled with friends","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Actually, it was even more perfect than the year before. I booked a standard room with ocean view  and got a free upgrade to a studio room with ocean view, it was a very good surprise after 20 hours traveling from Europe.

The location is very convenient, not on the beach but within walking distance. It's close to every attractions in Waikiki.

The most amazing point was about employees, they were always very helpful and polite. That really made the difference.

The valet service was very efficient, no matter when you ask for your car, it was always there in less than 5 minutes. A bit pricey (30$/day) but it did worth it. 

My return flight was at 09pm and the check out was at 11am. I explained to the concierge and he allowed me to keep the room until 7pm, that was a real late check out!!

Yes, the pool is obnoxiously small, the reception area and lobby are not grandiose or overly austentatious. Where the Trump truly shines is the employees and their attention to detail and focus on serving the customer. 

When we arrived, our room was not yet ready as the previous tenants were having some sort of medical issue and were late checking out. The front desk took our bags and sent us to the bar for a complimentary cocktail and hors d'oeuvre while we waited. We had reserved an ocean view suite for 10 days starting the Friday of Memorial Day weekend, so the hotel was fully booked and very busy. After our cocktails and snack, the room was still not done. They graciously put us in a temporary room to shower, change, and take a nap until our room was ready. Throughout our stay the employees exhibited the same high level of customer service. While waiting for our room, I asked the reception agent if our room had a wine cellar, since I had brought a couple bottles of wine that were in the $150 range when purchased 10-12 years ago. Some rooms did have this feature but ours did not, so he offered to store them for me in their cellar gratis. Each and every day at least one person working for the hotel did something to shine.

Service is fantastic, housekeeping is seriously one of the best I have experienced, towels are changed day & evening and our room is always tidy and clean. Going to the beach we are supplied with beach bag, towels, water, sunscreen & fruit. Bed so comfy but not so much the sofa beds!

Price isn't cheap but we felt it was worth it. During our stay we had an evacuation at 1am in the morning due to a broken water valve, we all descended down the stairs but there wasn't any direction from staff and was not informed  when we could go back to our rooms, we basically just followed the crowd when it was over. I think lesson learnt they need some sought of authority during these emergencies.

Trump is closer to the nicer part of Waikiki beach near the Hilton Hawaiian Lagoon, the beach is wider, cleaner and less crowded with many restaurants and bars along the beach walk. There's also a large grass area to hang out if you don't want sand.

The hotel is very clean, friendly and deserves its 5*. 

When we arrived we were greated with Handmade necklaces and taken to reception for check in. It was easy and quick and were then escorted to our room. 

Upon arrival we had a bottle of wine courtesy of the hotel as we were celebrating our anniversairy, this was a special touch which we really appreciated. 

The housemaides regulary cleaned our room well and provided new towels etc and would always come of an evening for turn down service. 

The concierge service was very good and they recommend some shopping malls, places to see and helped us with any queries we had. They also provide the beach bag which comes complete with Towels, suncream, fruit and water, perfect for if you dont want to bring your own.

The pool and Jacuzzi at the hotel was clean and you have a fabulous view of the other hotels and sea. It does become very windy up there which is great if you want to sit in the sun and get a great tan. The beds are comfortable and water is available at anytime.

The bar is great, wasnt too busy when we went of an evening, I would say the cocktails were a little pricey for what you got but I expected this of a hotel chain such as Trump. 

The location is great, 5 Mins from the beach, 2 mins from the shopping strip which has plenty of places to eat at.

At that price i expected a better quality hotel. it is constructed with all the hallmarks of building efficiencies rather than luxury finishes. The ground and lobby areas are constrained and cramped. Corridor sizes are tight and ceilings low, and the pool is tiny and not very appealing and is certainly not kid friendly. The lifts are too small and there is not enough of them necessitating long waits at times for service. 
added to that some of the smaller additional charges can be annoying such as paying $17 to watch a movie, and $30 per day for the hire car we rented
 - if i'm paying $12,000 for five days, I expect to able able park my car and watch a movie in my room and put one on for the kids without feeling you're getting tickled up again.

Since it's only an annual event, we like to pamper ourselves with 5star & luxury when we travel.

We have researched many hotels in Waikiki for 3months before travelling and decided to book 3 different hotels throughout our 2 weeks stay just so we are not stuck with one hotel in case we do not like it. Also, it's nice to book different budget/themed hotels just to experience how they are like.

We selected lower budget Hyatt Place Waikiki (turn out to be the best value), medium budget Outrigger Reef on the Beach (worst value, we moved out after one night) and highest budget JW Marriott Ko Olina (worst value as well and a ripoff). Read my reviews on these 3 hotels on TripAdvisor to find out more.

After one intolerable night at Outrigger, we decided to look for another hotel and Trump International was the natural solution, it being the number 1 hotel on Tripadvisor and we wanted to check out what the fuss was about.

As we were already in Waikiki, we decided to view the rooms personally before booking as we do not want to fall into the same trap as Outrigger, where it was rated ""4 star"" or more by Tripadvisor reviewers but when we personally experience it, was more of a ""tourist class"" hotel, rooms were badly outdated, bad soundproofing and noisy. 

We were shown 2 different rooms at Trump and straight away, we knew we have found the 5star standard we were after.

Trump is about 3yrs of age, hence, all facilities still look brand new, including rooms, pool, carpet, business center, etc. There is a kitchenette in all guest rooms and though we did not need to use it, it comes in very handy for those who wants to save and cook instead of dining out. The kitchenette is fully equipped with everything, you do not need to bring any extras.

The bathroom is a good size though we would prefer the toilet to be separated from the shower so others can use when one is showering. 

There is a lap pool at the Lobby plus Spa, which was great.

The most ""Wow"" experience for us was their ""Spectacular"" Customer Service, which was personalised, cheerful, customer focused and going the extra mile, unlike other hotels which claim they are luxury/5star, eg JW Marriott Ko Olina, but provide robotic service if any!

We lost our belongings at a Luau and due to travel Insurance claims purposes, we are required to lodge a police report. The manager, Jeff, went the extra mile to help us out, contacted the police to come to the Hotel so we can lodge the report, gave us a private spot at the breakfast lounge to do this and even stayed with us during the police report just in case we need anything! 

Now, We have travelled all over the world including Europe, Asia, USA, Australia, NZ, you name it, and stayed in all sorts of hotels, we have never had such personalised service!

Also, the day before we check out, we received a call from the Hotel thanking us for staying with them and asking us if there is any assistance we require for checking out eg wake up call, luggage, transportation, etc. None of the other Hotels do this. 

Our flight back to Australia was 10am and have to checkout by 7am, the bills were all ready when I step in front of the Reception unlike other Hotels, when you call them from the room asking them to prepare the Invoice, you still need to wait when you reached Reception. The bellman was also on the way up to the room collecting our luggage and our rental car was already parked out front, all as requested the night before and without any reminders! I call this ""Customer Service""!

Cons:-
1. The shampoo/bath gel/conditioner smelt horrible though and could be improved.
2. The buffet breakfast cost $35++, and lack variety, definitely not worth the value as Denny's Restaurant is just across the street and on Waikiki Beach Walk, there is another restaurant offering cooked breakfast for less than $10.
3. Could have separate toilet and shower.","Date of stay: January 2013","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

The staff was beyond helpful...even sending a bell hop up to our room the night before we were checking out to weigh our luggage (we had done some Christmas shopping).  When we checked in we were instantly upgraded to a full ocean view room, where a box of cookies (Honolulu Cookie Company) and a bottle of champagne greeted us!  The valet gave us great tips on where to go on the North Shore, down to which shrimp trucks were the best to stop at (we were not disappointed).  Before we even checked in we had contacted the concierge to help with dinner reservations at Alan Wong's, which he secured without a problem.  He also let them know we were celebrating our honeymoon, which resulted in being greeted with congratulations from the hostess and a personalized menu singed by Alan Wong and his staff.

First of all - location cannot be better - just next to everything important - but not directly on the beach so you save yourself all the mess of dirty public areas and too many people in public areas...

The hotel is really high style - rooms are huge and room showers are very large and comfortable. Beds are among the best I ever slept on!!

Hotel audience is mixed - 50%+ are Japanese, and ages are mixed between young families and couples.

The hotel is well managed and service was impeccable - anything we needed was addressed immediately and at best quality.

Public areas are a bit small - pool is beautiful with amazing direct Waikiki views - but size is a bit small. only 1 small Jacuzzi that can be packed at times, and no sauna.

Although hotel is not directly on beach - they provide you with beach bag with everything you need every time you want to go to the beach, and you can rent beds and umbrella for $40 / day (a bit overpriced but at least you have the option!).

Bottom line - I would highly recommend this hotel for its location, service, and room quality.","Date of stay: December 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

For the most part, it is a great addition to the Waikiki strip - great location, modern, luxurious, and with excellent staff. Highly recommended...
   The hotel is not right on Waikiki Beach but it is only a block away, just across the street from the Outrigger Reef. This is the perfect place to be close to all the action, both on the beach and in the restaurants and shops. You couldn't have a better location unless you want to be near Diamond Head or the zoo.
My room was a deluxe studio ocean view, and it was very nice. Unlike The Donald, the room is surprisingly muted. The bathroom is almost completely white, with marble floors and counters and white walls with no pictures. A bit bland, and I didn't like the faucet taps or the fact there was only one towel hook. It also has an open room shower, which might put some people off but I didn't mind.
   The living quarters were also conservatively decorated but much nicer with some tasteful art and furnishings. A very well equiped kitchen, large living room and private lanai with a nice view completed the picture. All in all, very nice.
    The hotel had three restaurants, one for breakfast/lunch, Wai'Olu for dinner and drinks, plus a steakhouse which I didn't try. Wai'Olu is surprisingly affordable for a Trump property restaurant. It's more of a small plate, tapas style restaurant but the food was very good, and you HAVE to try their Mai Tai, which apparantly won a world's best award and I can see why, it was outstanding.
   Nearby excellent restaurants include Nobu, Roy's, Ocean House and others in high end properties Halekalani and Royal Hawaiian. Starbucks is across the street at the Outrigger, and EggsNThings is just up the road for breakfast (very busy!). And there are tons of casual eateries nearby as well. Certainly no lacking for choice!
  The hotel itself doesn't have any shops, but you are only a block off the main strip.
Service throughout was top notch and friendly in the warm Hawaiian way, this is not a formal city so hawaiian shirts and shorts are perfectly acceptable. You will love your time in Honolulu!","Date of stay: December 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Staff is some of the friendliest we've encountered in 20+ years of visiting Hawaii. The valets especially are very helpful and genuinely nice people. My husband and I had some treatments at the spa and found our therapists to be very good.

One weird detail: I could touch the ceiling of our bathroom and I'm 5ft 4in so I'm guessing the ceiling was only 7ft. The ceiling popped up a bit in the bedroom and sitting area, but overall the feeling it gave was still a little bit claustrophobic. Taller people might not be comfortable in this setting.

Even though this is not a beach-front hotel, in the public areas such as the lobby bar the designers did a wonderful job of capitalizing on views over the treetops of the neighboring park. The hotel does give off a big city, Manhattan type of vibe but that's in keeping with the Trump brand. In my opinion the architects did the absolute best they could with this piece of property, to maximize views and minimize the impact of other buildings. 

Is this the #1 hotel in all of Honolulu? Personally I would put it at #3 behind the Halekulani and the Kahala, but that is based on my love of those two properties and not anything particularly wrong with the Trump. It is definitely one of the best hotels in Honolulu.","Date of stay: December 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The staff where very accommodating. Location wise, the hotel is well placed and in walking distance to good shops and restaurants.

From the time we arrived until we left, we experienced exemplary service by the staff.  Everyone was so very warm and friendly. Concierge was super helpful with every request.  As others have experienced, we were also upgraded from a deluxe studio to a 1 bedroom suite.  Gorgeous room, my DH did not want to leave.  Food in the lounge was wonderful and the mai tai really was the best I had, after sampling many on three islands.  We also liked the location, Waikiki is only steps away.  You are also very close to Roy's, the Halekulani's restaurants and Duke's.   
The only quibble with this magnificent hotel is that housekeeping was not quite up to the rest of the wonderful service at the hotel.

It was our first trip to Hawaii so we did not know what exactly to expect. We booked online several months in advance and were in touch with a hotel concierge beforehand who was very helpful in suggesting activities and accommodating our room request. We arrived and were greeted to a nice welcome from a friendly staff. We booked a studio room but were upgraded to a 1 bedroom suite overlooking the beach. 

The room was really nice and far exceeded our expectations. The full kitchen was incredible. The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was beautiful and it also had a washer and dryer which was really nice. The only downside to the room was noise from the street which we could hear fairly easily even up on the 18th floor. This did not bother us at all and it was just average background street noise. The room gets 5 stars from us. 

The food all around was great. We ate breakfast at the hotel every day, once getting room service and the other days at the buffet downstairs. Both were outstanding. We also got room service for dinner one night and a late night snack another time. The room service overall was tasty and reasonable priced for what you get. They did confuse our orders with another room on two occasions but otherwise the service was respectable. We also had a few drinks at the bar downstairs where they offer the ""world's best mai tai."" It is not your average mai tai and I thought it was excellent. The bar overall was nice. The food gets 5 stars from us.

As should be the case with any 5 star hotel, the service is what makes this hotel great. There were small glitches here and there such as with the room service but overall there were no problems at all. Everyone went out of their way to be friendly and helpful. Julia and Dean were the two most helpful and made our stay truly memorable. The next time we are in Honolulu, I don't think there's any question about where we'll stay. This is a great hotel.","Date of stay: June 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

This being my third year in a row staying at the Trump Waikiki during the December holiday season, I can say they have upheld their quality of service which reflects their top position on Trip Advisor for hotels on Oahu.

NEGATIVE: Not a big one, but you can see the wear of the carpets in the rooms. When I first stayed here, they were a bit more lush and brighter. 

POSITIVE: The welcome/bell service/check-in were impressive as always with lei's and infused water and hand towels. Welcome back cards in the kitchen in both suites -- one with a complimentary birthday dessert and the other with complimentary champagne for an anniversay celebration. The two-bedroom suites are not ocean front, but still a very good view. The 3-bedroom suite have the true ocean front and are breathtaking -- sunset from the room is absolutely beautiful (see picture). The Trump Floor is naturally on the top floors of the hotel and do have a richer decor -- ours came with a whole slew of island snacks, fruit baskets, and stocked fridge of freshly squeezed oj, canned drinks, and bottled water.","Date of stay: December 2012","Trip type: Traveled with friends","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I always thought if I typed a review it would be to warn people about a bad experience but the Trump Waikiki impressed me so much, that my first review is to compliment the awesome staff at Trump.  We traveled with our two daughters (7&9) and they loved the one bedroom suite with ocean view.  We returned every night to find there separate pull out beds completely made with there favorite bears already tucked in and a remote control beside them, a bottle of Hawaiin artisan water at there bedside.  Complimentary beach bags, boogie boards etc are handed to you with a smile every day as you head out to the beach (just across the street).  Room service delivered delicious hot meals literally within ten minutes and I still don't know how they can do that!? The infinity pool is certainly not a resort style pool but our girls still loved it, and we enjoyed the hot tub on a rare cool rainy day.  They offer you kindles, IPods etc. with the pool side service (another extra nice touch).  I recommend the ocean view room, beautiful views and front row seats to the Friday night fireworks show from your balcony.  To summarize, you will find the Trump to be more expensive than nearby hotels, but worth every penny.

This seems to be a better hotel for business travel. 

The staff is extremely friendly and everyone is helpful with giving you recommendations of places to go and where to eat. We were greated with leis when we arrived and there were Honolulu cookies in our room when we arrived. 

Our room was nice and spacious with a fully stocked mini kitchenette, which we didnt use much but I can see it being a nice option if you are with family and looking to save. My only complaint would be that there is NO real counter space in the bathroom to put your necessities. 

Housekeeping is OK. They did the basic - make the bed, put new towels - but I dont feel like they vacuumed and wiped everything down on a regular basis. I'm an extremely neat person and I noticed this,

We didnt eat much at the hotel as there are so many great restaurants on the island. They were however helpful in making reservations for us. I would recommend Azure and Roys which are all walking distance from the hotel and the food is amazing. For breakfast we ate at the hotel once and it was over prices and not that great. We ended up walking up the block each morning to Eggs n Things and while there is a wait if you dont get there early, the food is great and inexpensive.

The pool was disappointing as it was small and on most days it didnt catch the sun until later in the afternoon. They were also doing maintainence work on the floors above so sections of the pool were closed off each day. The beach is walking distance right across the street and it is really nice that the hotel provides a beach bag with towels, sunscreen, water, and fruit.

Overall I felt that this was lacking the 'romance' factor that I was expecting to feel at the hotel. We did Maui after this and you could feel the difference.

We searched extensively for a hotel that could comfortably accommodate our family of 4 and nearly all hotels offered us their only option of 2 x hotel rooms. This is both a very expensive option and i wanted to spend time with my family. I wanted all of us to be together but a room big enough that gave us some space. Thankfully, I found the Trump and booked an Oceanview 1 bedroom +den. On arrival we were warmly greeted and made to feel at home. We were upgraded to a 2 bedroom Oceanview room and all I can say is that this place is stunning. The room is spectacular, the staff are very  friendly, earnest to help but not intrusive and they try to accommodate every need. We are only part way through our stay ( still have a few more days left) and I can confidently say that I would not stay anywhere else. 13 years ago we stayed in a very popular, well renowned beach front hotel and disliked the experience so much I vowed I would never return to Hawaii, fortunately, I changed my mind. Ok,the beach is across the road but  it took all of 2 minutes to find a fabulous spot on the beach. The pool here is not big and is not as fancy as some of the other hotels but it is still perfectly fine. The staff are absolutely incredible and go out of their way to help you. The location is brilliant if you want to go shopping, go to the beach or catch a local bus to anywhere. Most people rave about this place and now I know why. This is recommended for couples, business etc but I would also recommend this for families as well - it is the perfect option for families, and I will recommend it to everyone I know. We walked to the beach today and the Concierge desk handed us a gorgeous bag with beach towels, water, sunscreen and fresh fruit; whoever thought of that idea is a real gem, well done! We were asked to give a time for the room to be serviced in the morning and in the evening and they have honoured that.

I loved every second of my stay at Trump.  I was treated like a celebrity from the moment I stepped out of the cab.  Not only were we upgraded to an ocean view room but Trump is celebrating by giving everyone a $50 voucher to spend in the hotel.  We spent it at Wai-olu Lounge and had an incredible meal - the poke is to die for!  We were also given a complimentary bottle of champagne as they noticed it was my husband and my 5th anniversary.  No detail went unnoticed and we were pampered and respected as individuals with unique tastes and preferences.  Trump is in a much nicer part of Waikiki than some of the other hotels.  It is about a 2 minute walk to the beach and it is a more private section of the beach; more like a haven than swarming with tourists.  When you have a beach like this - I'm not sure why people are so concerned about the swimming pool, which we loved at night with the lights and spa, but we were at the beach during the day!  The beach bag that the concierge gives patrons is an excellent idea and means that you have a fresh towel, water, fruit and a gorgeous bag to take to the beach - even on the spur of the moment.  The beds are the best beds in the world and the open air dining and sumptuous breakfasts are nothing short of stellar.  I was in no way disappointed and it was worth every cent.  You get what you pay for - there are some decidedly shabby hotels in Hawaii that look good on the website - but don't be enticed.  If you want to feel like a star - stay at Trump!

On another day, they had mistakenly given a new guest a key to our room, walking in on us!  That was terribly awkward and ridiculous.

The infinity pool was a disappointment. Very small and crowded. Watch out for Ocean View or Ocean Front lingo. The ""Ocean View"" room was a side view and was surrounded by other high rise hotels. This is a concrete jungle and not a relaxing holiday. The hotel is not on the beach. The beach is across the street and down a block. The good about the Trump is the staff. All of the staff was great but that is normal for most hotels in Waikiki. Definitely not worth 300 to 500 a night.","Date of stay: November 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

I couldn't have made a better decision for my family.  I am a very selective traveler when it comes to nice hotel, good location, exceptional service, superior comfort and cleanliness for my 2 young children and my reviews reflect these points.
 
THE LOCATION:  Across the street (Kalia) from the beach (2-3 minute safe crossing/pleasant view walking).  Anchor at the quiet end of Beach Walk with restaurants and stores behind it.  Within walking distance (1mile) to over 250 restaurants.  Great ocean view from 20th floor up, better/non obstructed view in corner rooms (Saratoga and Kalia).  Starbucks is across Kalia street at the front entrance of Outrigger hotel.  The nearest 2 ABC stores are around the corners (turn left on Kalia/then left on Beach walk and 200 ft down the street on the right is the smaller ABC; turn left on Kalia, then left on Lewers, 200 ft down the street is the bigger ABC).  Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center, International Market, all the shops are within walking distance.   

THE BUILDING:  37 floors and penthouse modern looking building.  The ground level is beautiful.  Valet/Bell service and Concierge are on this level.  The lobby/check in area is on the 6th floor.  The open concept lobby has a wonderful and airy view outside.  Key card is needed every time you go up to your floor.  Many people think that this building looks like a condo/apartment building and doesn’t have the look and feel of Hawaii.  It is personal taste.  I personally loved the building and its grand entrance and modern look.  In no way that Trump building is compatible to Aston Waikiki Beach Tower or Outrigger Regency on Beach Walk.  It is far more superior, in my opinion.   

THE ROOM:  We got upgraded from premium 1 bedroom/1 den ocean view (1120 sft) to premium 2 bedroom/1den/2 bath corner room (1625 sft) with beautiful view from each and every floor to ceiling window.  The furniture was simple, modern and clean.  It was fully furnished with sub-zero refrigerator/freezer, microwave, oven, stove top, wine cooler and EVERYTHING you need to prepare, cook, serve and eat.  Our room had a dining area with table and chairs; a stack up washer/dryer, 4 TVs and a DVD player.  The beds could be hit and miss.  One of the beds was firm and the other was soft but overall was comfortable enough for a good night sleep.  The bathroom has almost everything you need:  exclusive Trump bath products (to include spa products such as salt, body butter…), mouthwash, Q-tips, nail files, dental kit (and shaving kit per request), scale.  The towels were soft, plush and of good quality. The whole room was acceptably clean (slightly below my cleanliness standard but I am a freak).  From the balcony, we could relax and inhale the breath taking view and ocean breeze.  Overall, it was exceptionally comfortable for our family.  My kids actually called it “home”, the first of many of our destinations.       

THE HOTEL ANENITIES:  3 restaurants and 24/7 room service, a Spa (small but adequate), an infinity pool (small, not a good choice for kids), a gym with refreshment and towels available, a library (with books, computer and printer), kids DVDs are available for check out and FREE WIFI in every room and all over the hotel.
  
THE SERVICE:  This is the highlight of Trump’s.  We couldn’t have appreciated the Attache’ service more.  They bought groceries and ALL the items we need (from 3 different stores) and have them arranged in the room prior to our arrival.  Everyone seem genuinely pleasant from speaking on the phone to responding to email.  We were greeted with shell lei upon arrival then escorted to the lobby for checking in.  In the mean time, we were handed cold towels and lei (or jasmine) infused water.  These are particularly welcome after a long trip.  Our luggage was delivered to the room within a few minutes.  Via Attache’s they knew my kids’ names and the special occasion we were here to celebrate.  Within 20 minutes of us arriving to our room, they brought welcoming snacks (Honolulu company cookie box and chocolate covered strawberries). The kids got their own welcoming cards with their names on it and each got their own cake pops.  Stuffed animals, color books and crayons were left on each of their beds.  The Attache’ manager called to welcome us.  Housekeeping service was another strong point.  I observed that they have enough employees to provide timely housekeeping and turn down service twice daily.  We are back to a clean and well made room everyday.  They meticulously left a bottle of water on each night stand.  Their attention to details was impaccable.  All requests were promptly handled.  The housekeeping staffs are extremely nice, polite and helpful.  Another highlight of Trump service/amenity was the beach bags that were available for your trip to the beach.  Each bag came with sun blocks, water bottle, small apple and orange and a towel.  Just stop by the concierge desk to pick it up and return the bag on your way back.  The day before our departure, the Attache’ manager called to check on our stay, scheduled luggage pick up and wake up call.  To me, the service at this hotel was amazing, friendly, helpful and non-pretentious.  We were pampered and spoiled.

THE FOOD:  We only ate breakfast at In Yo café a few times and had room service once at Trump’s.  The full breakfast buffet (cost $32) consist of pastries, smoked salmon, Chinese cha siu (Chinese BBQ) steam buns, scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, miso soup, waffle, potato, steamed vegetable, salad, Japanese cold noodle, rice porridge (a Chinese rice soup with all the toppings such as egg, green onion, ginger, fried cake on the side), many types of freshfruits, cheese, homemade strawberry yogurt, cereal, juices and coffee.  Also, eggs (all styles such as omelets…), oatmeal, smoothies are included in the buffet but only available on request.  Overall, food is decent and focuses on quality vs. quantity.  The service at the restaurant was average.  Servers weren’t all over you or were overly chatty.  They gave us rooms for eating and refill/remove dishes as needed.  Room service was on time and the food was decent.  The price was high for the room service menu but was totally expected for a 5* hotel.  

OVERALL:  Trump is truly a five star property paired with five star service.  It is not a Grand Dame of Waikiki like HaleKulani or Royal Hawaiian.  It is not a resort type (but if you are looking for a resort type for kids, no place better to stay at than Hilton Hawaiian Village).  It is a new kid on the block (a few year old) that is not only classy and elegant but hip and modern.  It is a great choice for couple but a better choice for family.  We would cross that street to go to the beach over staying at one of the properties on the beach and cramping into a tiny hotel room.  Before going to Hawaii, we were wondering if we’ve made the right decision staying at Trump.  After leaving Hawaii, we were wondering if we would stay at any other hotels beside Trump.  The answer is no.    

TIPS/RECOMMENDATION:  
1.	Request corner room on higher floor for better ocean view 
2.	Communicate to Attache’ service of your needs/requests.  They are extremely helpful
3.	The beach across the street is a bit rocky at the bottom, wear beach/water shoes instead of barefoot
4.	 Lower price breakfast buffet would be across the street at Outrigger Reef Hotel-Shore Bird restaurant ($14) but poorer quality (see my separate review).  They also have lunch buffet ($14) and a la cart; Happy hour dinner or a la cart dinner at more reasonable price.  Or, walk about 200 ft on Saratoga to Eggs and Things.  I personally like breakfast buffet at House Without a Key better (across the street in Halekulani hotel) 
5.	Good lunch/dinner spots around Trump’s:  Arancino Beach walk (200ft walk after turning left on Beach Walk from Kalia)-Great Italian food.  La Mer (in 
Halekulani)-Good French food, not good for kids.  Ramen Nakamura (left on Beachwalk and go about 300 ft.  Turn left on Kalakaua and it is on your left)-Very good Ramen, kids are welcome.  Have kid and looking for American food?  Try The Yard House restaurant around the corner on Lewers or Cheesecake Factory (from Lewers, turn right on Kalakaua and go another 300ft)
6.	There is a Luau at Hale Koa hotel across the street on the beach that is much smaller, family friendly, great show and decent foods.  Don’t have to travel on the 
Bus to the much bigger Luau outside Waikiki.  Make reservation on ntheir website and select your table.  You don't have to be military family to go to this Luau 
      7.   Download the Aloha 2 Go app to your smart phone and order from tons of restaurants in Waikiki area for delivery.  The service fee is reasonable (half price at 
            $4.99 for ordering between 2-4pm).  You can view the menu and price and it is FAR MORE less expensive than the restaurants around.","Date of stay: November 2012","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Exceptional service.  I will be a returning guest, likely every time I come to Honolulu.  You will not regret staying here.

1.  Friendly.  Everyone greeted us, the front desk remembered us...one gal in particular, Julia, was so sweet to our baby boy.  She always greeted us with a smile and warm words.

2.  EXCEPTIONAL SERVICE (this should be #1).  My husband left his backpack in the cab as we were dropped off at the airport returning to California.  Of course I noticed about 5 minutes after the cab had left that the backpack was missing.  Luckily we had the cab driver's name...one would think that United Taxi would be able to locate its own cab driver.  Nope.  Apparently not.  Unbelievable.  I told my husband to play his wild card and call the Trump.  He did.  Troy answered the phone.  My husband told him what happened, the cab driver's name, & Troy said ""oh yeah, I think I know who that is"".  Again, WOW.  Troy got a hold of him, called us back and told us he would be returning to our terminal with our backpack.  Now that, people, is SERVICE.  Troy could easily have said ""I'm sorry, we can't help you""...which most (even the taxi company itself) would do...but that extra step, that extra bit is what sets this hotel apart from others.

3.  Hotel itself is immaculate.  You can read about the beach bags they hand out, the restaurant(s) service & food (all wonderful), but our room was clean every day even with a 1 year old baby boy running around.

It may not be the cheapest hotel around, but it's actually priced VERY well for what you get.  I was very, very pleased.  If you have kids, I would suggest going for the 1 BR suite...you have extra room, a washer/dryer, and a full kitchen...all very useful.

It's not on the beach, but it's a short walk back and forth.

Had the Signature massage...I wish I remembered the masseuse's name...she is Japanese, her name starts with a ""K""..sorry, not very helpful.  I normally NEVER go to hotel spas...I feel like you spend a lot of money and get a very fair massage.  This gal did not disappoint.  My husband booked it as a surprise for me, and I rate it a 5.  Front desk gal was not very friendly, but the massage itself was fantastic.  For $250, it better be!

Eggs n Things is a few blocks up from the hotel, very yummy breakfasts.  Doraku Sushi in the mall close by also very good...happy hour was really good, and a very good deal.  Nico's on Pier 38...try it!

We arrived in Waikiki on our honeymoon. We were greeted warmly and with a Lei and taken to our room on the 21st floor - a 1 br suite. The bathroom was amazing - a wetroom type shower and a deep soaking tub, king size bed that was SO comfortable with an amazing doona and sumptious pillows. We had a partial ocean view, looking towards diamond head. The staff are very focused on how YOU are. We were disappointed that as a honeymoon couple, we were not recognised as such - our travel agent did put this in the booking and suggested we take our wedding certificate as proof for upgrade options and welcome champagne - neither of which we got. However, having been here for a week we realised that it did not matter. We did get Honolulu cookie company biscuits that are yummy, you get a great beach bag daily with 2 pcs fruit, 2 drinks, sunscreen and towels and it is a short walk to the beach. The pool was small and there were lots of people, but as we are so close to the beach, it did not matter. The beach nearby is rocky, going closer to Diamond head you dont get the rocks. We shopped at ABC and ate brekkie at Outrigger (which offers a discount when you go back). Dinner at the hotel (not BLT) was expensive and the meal yummy but small. We hired a car and took advantage of the great Valet service. The valet staff and concierge staff are fantastic. we would definitely stay again!

The staff remember your name, there are all very friendly and the location is excellent for exploring Waikiki. We've been to Oahu many times before and this time decided to stay in a top end resort, we chose the Trump due to the many top reviews the hotel gets and believe me they deserve it. 

Our room was a small studio overlooking Beachwalk, we had room number 916. If you get chance to book this room go for it, you can see the water from the balcony and the room is gorgeous, plenty of room and comes equipped with a kitchen so you can cook your own meals if you desire.

Within walking distance are numerous restaurants, so you'll be spoilt for choice.

The pool is not the biggest you've ever seen, but the staff bring around fruit and little nibbles for you as you sit around the pool, all free, they also layout your towels for you and make sure the area is clean and spotless, all done with a smile. 

Check in was easy as is check out, we arrived on an early morning Jet Star flight from Sydney, arriving very tired, but that's another review for later. We got to the Trump well before check in time, like 9am in the morning, but the hotel were kind enough to give us a room so we could freshen up and have a sleep and a cup of coffee until our room was ready, free of charge.

Tell me any other hotel that provides that service for you?

You get what you pay for and we were not disappointed.
We (4 adults and one child) spent 8 nights in a 2 br + den ocean view appartment.  We were upgraded from a 2 bedroom (without asking, nice surprise) and it made such a difference as the apartments are not huge.  We were on the 18th floor and had sensational views.
We travelled with a young child and we were worried about taking him to Trump, but they made such a fuss of him with toys, books, videos, chocolates - he was spoilt rotten.
The service is impecable, so very attentive.  Tipping is appreciated but they don't hang around waiting for it.  Twice daily room service (including turndown), dishes are done, towels and sheets changed (were done daily for us but they say every second day), fridge stocked with bottled water, like walking into a new room every day.
The pool is on the small side, but perfect for lounging and getting lost in the view.  Also perfect to watch the Friday night fireworks from the pool deck.
It's no problem walking 2 minutes to the beach, I'd suggest turning right and walk up towards the Hilton, there is a jetty and a sort of cove / inlet there, the sand is free of rocks and much nicer underfoot.
Take advantage of the beach bags - sunscreen, water, towels and fruit, compimentary and very convenient.
We didn't eat at the restaurant as it didn't really look family firendly - more intimate and sophisticated than we were up for!
My only criticisms (if you can call them that) is that there is absolutely no where to hang a towel in the bathrooms and they take a ""small"" $200ish per day charge on your credit card to cover incidentals  - in addition to the total room amount up front.  This can be a bit of a surprise if you're not expecting it (adds up over 8 nights).  It does drop of day by day if not used but still worth knowing about.

Because I traveled with my 3-year-old daughter, I will focus mostly on the service and amenities that catered to her.

We ate at the In-Yo cafe for breakfast buffet one morning. She was free of charge, and there was plenty for her to eat (she is vegetarian). They offered her a place mat with stickers to keep her occupied. She loved all the guava/passion fruit juices and kept asking for more.

They provided a welcome gift for her, as well as cake pops and a card welcoming her with her name on it! Her favorite feature in the hotel, however, had to be the pool. Yes, it is not the largest pool on the block, as some reviewers mentioned. However, for us it was perfect. There are 3 wading areas leading into the pool (that were just 6"" deep), which was the PERFECT area for my 3-year-old to play in, without fear of her falling into the deeper area. Then (I was so surprised by this), we discovered that they supplied swim diapers next to the pool area, in 3 different sizes. I came prepared with my own swim diapers, but we definitely made use of this when we were @ the pool and it was more convenient. In addition, they pool staff provided my daughter with inner tubes to play in in the pool, when they were stocked with them. I brought a life vest for her, but she enjoyed the security of both the vest and inner tube. We ordered lunch and smoothies @ the pool, and we enjoyed the smoothies very much. They even had a kids' menu, and we ordered her a PB & J sandwich with fries. 

We stayed 6 days, and my sister and I were so sad to leave by the week's end. We had gone to Honolulu to celebrate my sister's 30th birthday, and they went above and beyond expectations to make her feel special. Little things such as a call from the Attache department, as well as sending up a dessert on her birthday, made her birthday that much more memorable. The staff was so personal and genuinely hospitable, that my sister & I felt as though we were leaving friends.

The hotel provided a beach bag with towels, water and sunscreen for our day at the beach, then let us have a very late check-out to shower and clean up before we caught our flight back to the mainland.  The breakfast buffet was an international affair, with a heavy Asian influence plus American favorites.  The flatbreads at the bar/restaurant provided a yummy, reasonably-priced and filling dinner before check-out.  Although this hotel is not on the beach, it is a one-block walk through a park to the best section of Waikiki beach.  Other hotels that are ""on-the-beach"" really have no beach, so this location was great!  We really enjoyed this hotel and would not hesitate to return.","Date of stay: November 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

This is not a high roller resort style hotel with a vast number of restaurants and special features, but everything is done very well and the staff are right up there with the very best.  At some places you get the irksome impression that the staff are overly nice because they are worried about supervisors, cameras or other staff members so that there shmoozy inquiries into your health and well being become annoying.  The Trump staff are caring very willing to help without you feeling like your skin is crawling.

The rooms are very well presented, but perhaps not at fine five star level.  The couple of restaurants in the hotel are very expensive when you consider you can walk down the road and have equal quality food for less than half the price.  

The concierge staff were knowledgeable and always willing to assist, without it seeming like a chore or with them being over the top.

If you want a resort type hotel, with all of the attending bling, then this is not the hotel for you.  If you like to feel very well looked after and fell as if you have uncovered something a bit different with a touch of being 'special', then this is a very good option","Date of stay: September 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

The service was near perfect, all staff are friendly and helpful. The only little glitches were a one-off lapse of service at the Wai'oulu Bar where we were a bit forgotten about. The other two times we dined here we had excellent service especially from Jaime. Would recommend the Wai'oulu for its really good Tapas food, and it has great views of the ocean.

The pool is excellent with amazing views. The size of the pool is relatively small compared to some other hotels but works well. The pool service is attentive and friendly especially from Angie. One of our pet peeves is screaming kids and we found this hotel to be pretty much kid free especially when compared to other places like the Embassy Suites which is over the road.

The hotel's breakfast restaurant In Yo is in a beautiful setting and has a good range of food including continental meats, cooked breakfast, fruits, and Japanese style food. We found it expensive at $33 + tax + tip per person. There are many good and cheaper options just a moments walk away.

The room (we were on level 12 room #1214) was very well presented. It had the mini kitchen was well appointed (full range of cooking equipment). A great bathroom with twin basins. This room also had a balcony (Lanai). TV is large, bed is good. The view was city which overlooked the pool of another hotel which was fine. If you do want a view of the ocean go for ""ocean view"". You will overlook a park through to the ocean. The sunsets are beautiful and the night view is also  good with the lit up buildings across the park. 

The Hilton lets off fireworks every Friday at 7:45pm so if you are in a room on the park side (the Bar and pool also see this) you'll get a brilliant display! We went to the beach and watched from there which is also excellent.

Overall we would definitely go back to the Trump Hotel.","Date of stay: November 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We knew when we arrived at the airport and told the taxi dispatcher that we were staying at the Trump and she said, ""ooh, wow, nice"" that we were in for something special!  We arrived and were given a shell lei, a cool towel, and a drink.  The big airy check-in on the 6th floor is delightful, and the staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome!

From there, we were shown our room, a wonderful partial ocean view one bedroom.  We had an immense foyer, a washer and dryer, a full kitchen, an enormous bathroom, a decent sized bedroom, and a wonderful living area to rest in.  I was shocked to find not only a box of Honolulu Company cookies, but also a piece of birthday cake with a personal message!  Really thoughtful.  

It truly doesn't get better than this.  The pool was really nice and relaxing, great views of the sunset and absolute amazing pool side staff that were super nice and helped me get rid of my vog headache!  They give you a beach bag to take to the beach with you with towels, bottles of water, sunscreen, and fruit.  Everything you could ever need!  We asked for extra towels and were given them no problem.  The concierge helped us book tours and delivered the vouchers right to our room. The nightly turn down service was delightful and it was great coming home to a clean room every night after our afternoon showers from being at the beach all day.

We stayed there October 26-30, 2012. We booked a one-bedroom city view and were given a complimentary upgrage to a one-bedroom plus den (two full bathrooms) with a full oceanview along with a $50 meal voucher. My 6 year old's comment when she flopped into bed after watching the Friday night fireworks from our room summed it up the best: Ahhh, home sweet hotel! Even our 9 month old was comfy in the full crib (not a pack and play)! The only problem that we had was that our refrigerator must have stopped working in the middle of the night of our second night and most of our groceries had to be thrown out. They were VERY prompt about fixing it--the fan had to be replaced and it was fixed and back to normal refrigerator temperature within 4 hours of my phone call notifying them that it was not working. I was a little sad they didn't offer to replace our groceries, and I am sure they would if I had asked, but I was too sheepish to ask--the value that we got with the room, the service, and the extras such as the complimentary upgrade and meal voucher, stuffed animal, cakepops and Wii for the kiddo, fully stocked beachbags whenever we wanted, etc. surely surpassed the $50 lost in groceries! I would stay there again in a heartbeat if we returned to Oahu and Trump hotels will be first on my list if we travel to any other city where there is one. We stayed at three different hotels during our trip to Hawaii--one in Maui that felt like a normal hotel, the Trump which I wished I could have stayed in longer because it felt like a vacation home, and a third on in Oahu that made me ready to go back to my own home in Minnesota. I guess my only ""complaint"" is of our own doing--this is now the standard of service my family will want to compare everything else to!","Date of stay: October 2012","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Trump was recommended by a friend of a friend. So glad we took her advice! We stayed for 4 nights in a Superior Studio with partial Ocean View. Whilst our friends stayed in a Deluxe Studio with an Ocean View. Our room had everything you needed and it was quite spacious. The deluxe was larger & complete with sofa & coffee table, the extra space came in handy as we were ordered back to our rooms for a night due to a Tsunami warning. The deluxe room comfortably housed the 4 of us for room service and TV watching. I really can't fault Trump International. The service was impeccable! From the moment we exited our cab we were greeted with warm smiles and eager staff ready to assist. We were given Lei's and at check in watermelon infused water and a cool hand towel to clean our hands. We were given early check in and a room on a high floor. The rooms were extremely clean, the bed was divine, house cleaning was always very thorough. The location was good - only one block back from the beach ( we had stayed at Sheraton Waikiki at the beginning of our trip which was right on the beach) so I did find myself comparing a little regarding the distance. The Wai'Olu bar had tasty light meals and lovely drinks. We always made a point to try and have a drink at sunset before we headed off for dinner. This hotel has it all, yes the inifinity pool is small but never had a problem with pool crowding and we weren't at Waikik primarily to swim in the pool.

The concierge at this level is very helpful with supplies of beach bags containing towels water fruit and suntan lotion all of which is complimentary. 
Our room was facing over the city, as we expected, but was well appointed, with spacious room with every convenience and adjacent kitchenette . The only downside was the limited wardrobe space.
Wifi is complementary in all areas and contrary to other guests I found the speed perfectly acceptable.
The pool is more of a plunge pool but is perfectly adequate. The jacuzzi is a great relaxer.
Breakfast in the In Yo Restaurant Is either buffet which is international and excellent or a la carte, both of which we used.
The Lounge Floor restaurant has an extensive menu, some areas on the balcony are a little too dark and would benefit from added lighting. There is the flagship BLT Restaurant on the street level which we did not try as we wanted to widen our experience in the short  3 night stay.
The staff were incredibly efficient, polite and available.

The condition of the suite was a good size overall but the carpet needs to be changed.

But were not welcomed with the towel or drink which many of the previous hotel guests have mentioned.Not that it mattered.
The staff at the front desk do not look professional and it was quite a surprise for a hotel of this level.
We have stayed in many hotels of this level all over US and overseas and were very surprised at the front desk staff at this particular Trump hotel.Some of them do not seem to know much and have given out worng information.Some were not friendly esp one particular girl.
We wonder whether they are in training as they look young and their 'uniforms' did not look well ironed.
Perhaps, we expected more after reading the numerous wonderful reviews.

Ever","We had an amazing time in Hawaii and it has a lot to do with Trump being our hotel choice in Honolulu. The concierges were the highlight of the hotel - they went above and beyond their call of duty to help us enjoy every second of our honeymoon. The hotel room itself was super modern and beautiful. The pool was a little small, but being right there in front of Waikiki beach, there really wasn't any reason to complain. I've never stayed at a Trump hotel before, but if this is what it's like across their hotel chain, then this definitely won't be my last time at a Trump. We're by no means wealthy people and the pricing was actually competitive. Of course we splurged for our honeymoon, but we could have spent a lot more than we did and got a lot less if we went elsewhere. It didn't feel like a fake and boring resort ... It instead felt real and modern. My wife and I actually miss the concierges after spending 8 days with them :) we miss Hawaii in general and that's thanks to our experience at the Trump, 5 stars for sure.","Date of stay: September 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We had a suite that was not ocean view, but since it was so large with so many windows, we actually could catch a view of the ocean on one side.     The hotel is immaculate and our room was very spacious.   My only wish was that the actual bedroom was a bit larger, the kitchen and main living room area was so spacious, would have loved a foot or two more in the bedroom.

We were so impressed by the service.  The staff were very attentive which would be expected at a 5 star hotel.  As mentioned in many of the reviews, we loved the complimentary beach bags filled with towels, snacks, water, and sunblock.  The best part about our experience was the hospitality room they provided us on the last day.  Our flight was not until 10:30 p.m. so I asked for a late check out. Unfortunately, the owner of our room (I guess it is a timeshare), was coming in later that day, so they couldn't give us a late-check out.  Instead, they moved us to another suite so we could stay there until we had to catch our flight in the evening.  They called it a hospitality suite, but it was pretty much the same hotel room on a different floor.  It really saved us so much headache and hassle of having to be stranded for the whole day until our flight!  We used the pool and went to the beach on our last day knowing we would have a room to come back and shower in.

We had heard some wonderful reports from friends and decided to stay for one night, but unfortunately had booked somewhere else for the 2 nights on our return from Vegas.

We arrived at the hotel at 8am and were told they were ""expecting us"" and had our room ready after our long flight.  We find that check in times are getting later and later, so were pleasantly surprised to find we could check right in.  Every single staff member was so helpful and accommodating - from baggage handlers to check in staff to house keeping, everyone was awesome.  The rooms were amazing, so clean and fresh with everything you would need for your stay.  As with other Trump hotels, the room amenities are great.  We had a standard room, but still contained a fully equipped kitchen, coffee machine, fridge etc - we could have stayed for a month!  Our room was on level 7, and although this was a low floor, and faced the road, we could not hear a sound.

We decided to explore the city and also head down to the beach.  The concierge had beach bags for us to borrow which contained beach towels, bottles of water, fresh fruit and sunscreen.  Such a great idea.  They also didn't mind us returning for extra bottles of water throughout the day which is great with the Hawaiian weather.

We spent the latter part of the afternoon sitting by the pool and enjoying some drinks at the bar.  Again the staff were sensational.  Very attentive and forever filling up the bowls of smoked almonds and wasabi peas - yum!

Even though the hotel has a few nice restaurants, the staff were more than happy to suggest other places for dinner.  Luckily on this evening it was a Hawaiian festival and the main street was being shut down and local vendors were setting up food stands so we decided to try something local.

Upon arriving back to the hotel turn down service had been and we were left with soft music playing, bottles of cold water by our bedside and a box of cookies from the Honolulu Cookie Company - yum!  We slept wonderfully in the beautiful bed!

Our room rate included breakfast which was a typical ""island"" buffet breakfast, aiming toward the Japanese travellers mainly, but there were plenty of things for everyone to eat - from Cheerios thorugh to Omelettes, toast, bagels etc.  There was plenty of fresh fruit, yoghurt etc.  They also had an additional menu that you could add items such as eggs benedict etc (for a cost).  The staff once again were very attentive and it was nice to see that some of them were fluent in Japanense as well as English - Trump Waikiki is a hotspot for Japanese tourists.

We weren't flying out until 2pm so we kept our room until 12 noon.  

Upon checking out we decided to check the rates for our return trip from Vegas.  Luckily they were happy to honour the rate we had got for the first night, so we booked with Trump and cancelled our other accommodation.

When we returned from Vegas (just before midnight) we were once again greeted in the same manner we were the first time, offered watermelon water and asked how our trip to Vegas was.  The fact that they recorded that information the first time was fantastic.  This made us feel ""home"".  Upon check in we were also told we had been upgraded to a 1 bedroom suite and that because it was their 4th birthday that we would receive a $50 dining credit!  Turndown service had already been done when we arrived, cold water and the BIGGEST box of cookies!  Again, a perfect experience.

I really can't speak highly enough of this hotel and can recommend it to anyone planning on visiting Waikiki that is flexible with their accommodation budget.

The housekeepers did a perfect job, washing up done for us, everything spotless and tidy.  Such a bonus considering that with our infant and toddler we did a lot of cooking in the beautiful kitchen.  Dining in the Wai'olu Lounge is a special thing to do - wonderful view of the sunset, music most evenings, heavenly cocktails and where, to complete our perfect 8-day stay, the chef created a special flambe` steak meal for us and our cheerful, attentive waiter attended to our every need.","Date of stay: September 2012","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The staff at the Trump go above and beyond to make all guests feel welcome and provide attention to detail in their service that is unsurpassed by hotels of this nature.

The room was like new, well designed with quality furnishings and amenities, including a kitchen. However, our room only had one small dining table, located on the balcony.  The bedding was reasonably comfortable and offered a decent sleep.

The hotel is located one block back from the beach and was very quiet given its location in the middle of Waikiki.  The hotel is designed so that although the hotel is a block back from the beach, many of the rooms have an ocean view.  Again, although not on the beachfront, the hotel has good lounge facilities on the beach. The hotel has quite a small lap pool, but the lack of a large pool does not really pose an issue given the proximity to the beach.

I have recommended this hotel to friends who have also returned impressed.","Date of stay: October 2011","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Hotel is relatively new -- three years and built from the ground up (not a remodel of an older property).  The bottom floors are reserved for the hotel while the upper floors are reserved for residences.  We were on the 9th floor which did not provide us with a view unless you peeked around the balcony.  The infinity pool is nice, but even there the view is limited as you need to view the water between buildings.  Food was just so-so -- my wife ordered something from downstairs and it was small and just average at best.  However, the location is great -- very near the shops on Kalakaua and just a hop on a bus away from Ala Moana Center.  Overall, happy with the stay since we were not promised an ocean view, but just know what you are getting before you book.  It is a very nice property but not on the beach and with limited views of the ocean.","Date of stay: September 2012","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

We did not actually eat at the restaurant so I cannot comment on that but my brother mentioned the room service was great.

The Trump's location is good, not right on the beach but barely a block back so that is no problem. It is opposite Fort Derussy Beach Park which is a favourite spot of mine in Waikiki but even so...

Price was right, and their booking process was easy and well explained. I would highly recommend as a cost effective option.

We were treated in a first class manner throughout our five day stay as if we booked directly with Trump. The staff is young, competent, cordial and professional.

We were visiting family on the island and had a car for our visit. The valet parking experience was great. Car was always ready at set time with only a quick phone call, and the valet service friendly and getting and in on Saratoga Street as  easy as could be.

One of our rooms had had a huge bathroom but very limited space around sink to put more a toothbrush and a bottle of mouthwash. Not the best design I have seen.

I would also suggest that some effort be made to put the the electronic safes at eye or shoulder level rather than making guests get  down on hand and knees to put in and take items out of safe.

Staying at the Trump was truly a wonderful experience. Upon arriving, my wife and I were assisted immediately with our car and luggage. Krystal welcomed us with leis and whisked us up to check-in. We were provided with a cold glass of flavor water and a cool towel to wiped our hand and face after our  8hr flight.  When informed that we were celebrating our 10th anniversary, we were provided with a card, some chocolate and a bottle of champagne which I thought was outstanding. In our room we had a box complementary cookies and so much water throughout our stay, we could not even drink it all. Julia greeted us daily and provided us with helpful information about sights to see around the island. The only bad thing I can say is the garden tub (Is HUGH) and may be a little difficult getting in and out as well as water getting on the floor, the other is we had to leave. Mahalo to the entire staff who treated us like celebrities. 

Other notes: Hotel was very quite; elevators and valet service was very fast; room was clean twice daily and we did not know they were even there. A comfortable library with books and computers (and a printer) to book trips or check e-mails as well as a nice useful gym. Kitchen (stove & sink), microwave, refrigerator, plates, glasses, silverware, very well appointed, clean, and useful. I like the soap and shampoo so much that I packed what I brough back up. Bathrobes and slippers are a nice added touch and the closet, although useful, is very, very small.

Pretty much every other hotel we stopped in seemed better. Way more to do and better location. I can't really say it is a bad hotel, but just expected a lot more. TA seems to mislead people into thinking its the best.  It's not. You will see.","Date of stay: August 2012","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

The Trump in Chicago is excellent.
We have two boys that we were traveling with a 20yr old and 10yr old. 
There was not much for the boys to do at the Trump. 
The pool--which is very small--was full of young kids splashing and jumping around with very little parental supervision. The pool was the biggest disappointment. There are only a few lounge chairs in the sun, so if you want to work on your tan poolside some early.
The restaurants offered little that the 10yr old would eat and to get to the beach you have to pack a bag and hike across a busy street and a public park.
On the plus side, Trump staff goes out of their way to make the vacation as pleasant as possible.The service is what makes this hotel special.
Turn down service was wonderful; saving us a lot of money for bottled water.
Housekeeping was prompt every morning and they even washed the dishes in the kitchen.
Beach bags service was a lifesaver. 
Pool side service was excellent.
Drinks and food is expensive as expected but everything we ordered was very good.
Overall, I would recommend this hotel to couples or business travelers.
Unfortunately, I don't think I would stay here again.","Date of stay: July 2012","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

We were on the fourth-night-free promotion. The room retailed for $599/night.  Our 11th floor view was very nice indeed.  The location is quite good.  My expectations were relatively high based TA reviews.  We chose Trump out of curiosity and the nice kitchenette in the unit.  The service ranged from very good to average;  it seemed somewhat inconsistent to me.  We had just come from a very nice stay at the Four Seasons Manele Bay on Lana’i so the bar had been set.  
Check-in was fine.  We were given an amenity for our anniversary, which was nice.  There was also a welcome letter and a stuffed Trump seal for our son, which made him feel special.  The room was clean and well-maintained.    However, there was a single peg on the back of the door for hanging towels.  We had plenty of good towels each day, just no place to hang them – strange in a beach environment.  There was also a very large unused space behind the bathroom door where towel racks could have been installed or a clothes rack for drying, not unheard of in a beach environment.  It was just an obvious blank area, as if the money had run out for any further enhancements. With three people in a room you need places to hang wet towels and swimsuits.  At higher-end establishments the little details define distinction.
The breakfast buffet and apparent food quality was a bit disappointing.  It felt like they were cutting cost corners and that doesn’t work when you’re targeting (presumably) the top-end traveler.  I’m already paying for breakfast for two adults, I’ll pay more, just make it a true high-end buffet like patrons expect.  The buffet should be at least as good as the buffet you’d find at a resort on little Lana’i, but it wasn’t.  Our 4-year old son did eat free (as he did at the FS) which was appreciated.   
The staff was friendly but the attitude sometimes seemed contrived, perhaps it was just the Waikiki pace (compared to Lana’i).   The ladies at the concierge were always pleasant and the beach bags with towels and water were nice.  I might send a couple of experienced employees from various departments ‘undercover’ to the Four Seasons on Lana’i and Maui to take notes.  That seems to be the standard they’re striving for and they’re definitely on their way.  
I took two postcards to the front desk and inquired how to most easily mail them.  They did it for me – great.  The $.90 could be billed to my room.  Okay, convenient.  Except at Four Seasons they have always mailed my postcards for free.  No, I could not care less about $.90 when I’m paying $600/night for a room plus another $75 for breakfast.  At least the wi-fi is complimentary (unlike Four Seasons) so I won’t complain.  We laughed about it.  
As others have mentioned, the pool seems an afterthought.  It is mostly patronized (and overrun) by young children although it was clearly designed for adults with aesthetics in mind.  As a former lifeguard it seems like an accident waiting to happen as all the surfaces are very slippery when wet with plenty of abrupt pool edges.  The readily visible pool across the street on the roof of the Embassy Suites looks more inviting (and much larger).  The fitness room is sub-par for a property of this caliber – I am biased as I use such facilities frequently.  Most guests/residents probably don’t care though.
Considering the view and actual unit it was not out-of-line for Waikiki.  The stay was satisfactory.  We just were not ‘wowed’ as we hoped we would be – expectations too high perhaps?  Not sure about next time; maybe the Royal Hawaiian or a top-end room at the Outrigger, or Trump again?
Pros – location, cleanliness, beach bags, wi-fi
Cons – pool, breakfast 
We tip the housekeepers each day, it’s then amazing the response you get when you request something.  They’re not overpaid and I don’t mind when we’re fortunate enough to be able to stay at places like this.","Date of stay: July 2012","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

We stayed for 7 days at the Trump Tower and loved every second of it.  
It is located 1 street back from the beach - but that was not a problem at all.
The Lobby restaurant has a great view and is the best place in Waikiki to see the Friday night fireworks.
Your room has everything possible & the staff... Well... if they were any friendlier you would want to take them home.
Nothing is too much of a problem & when you head off to the beach they give you a beach bag with water, towels, sun block & fruit - a really nice touch.
Free WIFI thru the entire hotel.
The pool area is quite small but still nice - you must try the water fountain in the pool area.  It is infused with melons & they also give you free ipads or kindles to use whilst at the pool.

We were fortunate enough to be ""upgraded"" to a Trump floor, but nobody told us what the benefits were and I am unsure what the difference was between our floor and say Fl. 30.  Even though the hotel was extremely busy most of the time the staff were friendly and helpful.  The location is ideal for walking to shops, the beach, and restaurants.  My two compliant's are one, the pool is totally inadequate for the number of guests in the building; maybe because it's vacation time, but it was impossible to get a quite moment poolside with all the screaming small children, and two, having to pay for newspapers given the cost ($$$$) of the suite.

Concierge staff were extremely well versed and we booked a number of day trips using their advice.....best trip as the Segway 3 hour tour....

I also recommend trying their happy hour...cheap drinks and tapas style food (which was exceptional)...and it's a great way to have an early dinner before venturing out into town. They also won the best Mai tai award for 2011 (best in the world) so its worth a try.

The hotel is also near the army museum so its in a quiet spot which is great...close to the beach and you can get day packs with towels, sunscreen and drinks for free from reception...great idea.

I'm not sure what I was expecting, well actually I kind of am. I expected this relatively new hotel to be top notch in all departments. It was a nice hotel, and if I was staying there in  city like NY or Dallas, I wouldn't have too much to complain about. But... this is Hawaii I was turned off a bit by the city feel of a hotel that was blocks from a beautiful beach. The staff was mostly friendly, but lacked the ability to make you feel special, like most great and pricey hotels should. Anyways, here's the real breakdown of the good and bad:
Pros: Location, concierge services (towel bags and overall friendly and helpful service), kitchens and laundry in most suites (very useful with 2 young'ns like we have.)
Cons: Food. 
Very mediocre breakfast and even worse room service. The quality of the food here is well below any reasonable expectation for the rates paid. I had a crab benedict that tasted like it came from a cheap chinese buffet restaurant.
Rooms.
The suite was very nice to look at the bed in the bedroom was very comfortable...but, I have to sleep on the couch due to my snoring, and the couch bed was so uncomfortable (the couch itself was too small to lie on) that I ended up with a bad neck for 3 days after my stay. Also, if you have small kids and think a regular suite will suit you, think again. Then under 800 sq. ft. of space is so cramped with all the furniture they have in it that our two sons, ages 2 and 4, had no room anywhere to run. This was as much my faullt as theirs, but you should know as a parent that theses rooms are way too tight to relax in with a full family.

That's it. I think it's probably a great place to stay if you are in town on business, or are without kids, so long as you can handle the food issue. My recommendation though would be to stay across the street at the Halekulani. It's a much hotel.

And one last thing...the spa isn't a spa, it's a massage room. Don't expect showers, saunas, or lockers.","Date of stay: July 2012","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

Our room exceeded expectations, it was HUGE even for a family of 5 (3 teenage children) we never felt like we were on top of each other as the kids all had their own beds - 2 of which were sofa beds that were comfortable and they had their own TV's (teenage heaven!) and there were 2 full bathrooms for the kids to share.
Our master bedroom suite was amazing with an absolutely devine king bed with spectacular views and a huge marble bathroom with large soaking tub and a massive walk in wardrobe.
The kitchen was full size and top quality including a wine chiller, ice maker in fridge, dishwasher and fully equipped which was great to have a meal in occasionally.
The laundry was awesome as travelling as a family it was great to be able to keep up with all the washing.
The room was immaculate and clean and housekeeping was provided twice a day. Bottled water was left by your bed each night which was a nice touch. I was also impressed by the air conditioning as it was extremely quiet. Often I have trouble sleeping at hotels due to the loud aircon.
In other reviews people have commented about the friendliness of the staff and all the reviews are true as all the staff are genuinally helpful right from the conceirge to housekeeping, nothing was ever a problem.
The beach bags are fantastic and we were even able to get boogie boards for the kids from conceirge and it's just an easy stroll across the road to the beach.
I was sceptical about the pool as I had read alot of negative comments but we loved it including the kids even though it was small it was still long and deep. The hot tub was great too.
The hotel was close to all the action of Waikiki shops and nightlife. One night we dined at Wai Olu Lounge which was a fantastic meal with great service from Michael.

We were upgraded to a huge, beautiful two bedroom suite (we have two kids) with a view of the ocean - perfect for the 4th of July fireworks. The kids were both given a stuffed toy which they immediately fell in love with, we were given complimentary cookies - these little surprises and the attention to detail were really impressive. When going to the beach, the concierge gives out a beach bag - complete with towels, water, sunscreen and fruit. We have never received such care or service in any hotel and we would recommend Trump without hesitation. Another review mentioned that the pool was cold - and we definitely agree that it could do with some heating.

Nothing! Everything was amazing! I came to Waikiki with 3 of my girl friends and we stayed in an ocean-view room with double beds. Our patio had breathe taking views of the ocean. The kitchenette was really useful, we made breakfast for 2 of the days and enjoyed it on the patio with nice ocean breeze (be careful of birds that will come and try to eat your food). There is a fireworks show at the Hilton on Friday nights which you can get a really nice view if you have an ocean-view room. I also LOVED the complimentary beach bags for hotel guests. It comes with water, a snack(usually an orange and an apple), beach towel and sunscreen. I thought that was so thoughtful and perfect for days when we drove around the island or just hanging on the waikiki beach. The pool at the hotel is a bit small and only has a view on one corner, but that wasn't really an issue for us since we didn't stay at the hotel for the pool. I like the inifinity pool idea but it would have been nicer over a cliff and not surrounded by other hotels.

The staff was all around so friendly and helpful! My girl friends and I had a really late flight out of Hawaii, the hotel staff was extremely understanding and offered us an ""hospitality room"" for us to use for FREE while we wait for our flight. The ""hospitality room"" was bascially a exact room like ours but on a lower level and without view. How awesome was that?! They even offered to move our luggage around for us.

We stayed at two other expensive, top quality hotels during this trip, but no one took the time or trouble to personalize our stay or to greet us with cakepops!  The furnishings and design of our one bedroom (upgraded to two bedroom) suite were exceptional. We had a gorgeous view on the (very small) balcony of Waikiki beach and of the city skyline.  We watched Friday night fireworks over Waikiki beach from our balcony.  The suite also had floor to ceiling windows so we could enjoy the view from every angle.  Bath amentities were plentiful (sugar scrub!) and top notch.  The concierge staff was very helpful even at a busy time.  The hotel is not on the beach, but its a really short walk across the street, so that didnt bother us, and I could tell from the price that it was not beach front.

No dramas they allowed us to leave our luggages there. Upon arrival after our trip to Maui, we were greeted with lei's and fruit infused water and our room was upgraded to a suite. Very welcoming staff. Rooms are cleaned twice a day. Very efficient service. Money well spent. We stayed for 4 nights and we really enjoyed every minute of it. Very close to the shops and the beach.

Really nice stay, well appointed room, great service, really friendly staff.

We read some great reviews about the Trump. Have to say, the Donald's reputation didn't make us that favorable to the brand--but the reviews talked us into staying there. Glad we did. I joined the trump card program just before I made a reservation. Not sure if there was any cause/effect but we were upgraded to a suite upon check in. Nice room.

Really nice property, about 200 meters to the beach and great views. The pool is really small and on the 6th floor. For several days, there was road construction going on so it was really loud at the pool side. Nothing the hotel could have done, so I won't hold it against them. The room itself (20th floor) was dead quiet.

We had dinner at the hotel the night of 4th of July and had a great view of the fireworks.

This isn't a mega resort hotel with water slides and screaming babies everywhere. There were kids and families, it just isn't a destination hotel for entertainment. The bar had live music and nice Mai Tai's.

It was pricey as compared to other places, I thought it was overall a good value. The breakfast was too expensive for us ($33 for the buffet). Eggs 'n' Things is about 300 meters away, much better deal.

We did a dolphin experience tour that didn't match up with the brochure. We mentioned it in passing to the concierge--they weren't happy and called the tour outfit and got us a 50% refund. Good case study in the quality of service the staff showed.

Would highly recommend it if you planned on staying in Waikiki.","Date of stay: July 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We stayed 3 nights in Honolulu and 5 in Maui. During the first part of our trip, we stayed at the Trump Waikiki for the 3 nights. We arrived a couple of hours early and were greeted with Lei's and escorted to the second level for check in. At check in, they greeted us with a cold towel and some lemon fresh water. While we waited for the room to get ready, we relaxed at the Wai`olu Ocean View Lounge where we enjoyed some appetizers and Mai Tais!

When our room was ready (earlier and expected) they had upgraded us to a 1 bedroom suite!... with the ocean view (I had booked the Ocean View studio). Our room had a full size kitchen with a wine chiller, two full granite baths (w/ stand up showers), an office section and two balconies, one off the bedroom and one of the living room. The king bed was topped with a cozy white down comforter and we just sunk in to sleep. The rooms have a modern touch (not crazy contemporary) and were simply amazing!

We couldn't wait for our Spa treatment for the following day, so they accommodated and fit us in for the same day. We thoroughly enjoyed the couples hot stone massage, which starts with a cup of tea and a foot wash while you're waiting. 

The BLT restaurant was on the first floor, and at first, were weren't sure if it was owned by the hotel or just another company leasing it. But we spoke with someone at the lounge and they said it was the hotel's so we booked dinner there for the second night. The Filet Mignon was served in the skillet and it went down like butter with out mashed potatoes. The food was overall awesome, and compared to other steak houses, the steaks here were at par or better!

The pool seemed small, however we didn't use it at all as we just went to the beach when we wanted fun in the water. Rarely, some reviews here complain about the hotel not being on the beach. If they read previous reviews, and noticed the name of the hotel (...'Beach Walk') they would know it's not on the beach. We knew it wasn't on the beach, but it was literally a 100-200 yard walk to the beach. There are large beach resorts that we've stayed at where the walk from the rooms to the beach is longer), so his was a breeze for us. Plus, we enjoyed the walk. The concierge gives you a beach bag with towels, sunblock, and water bottles before you head out to the beach every day. 

The best thing about the hotel was the SERVICE! It has got to be the BEST service we've ever received at any hotel. Donald Trump knows what he's doing. Say even if he doesn't manage his hotels hands-on or for daily operations, he really knows how to staff his company with the finest people (who then staff more fine people) to ensure that his customers are fully satisfied with the experience. We definitely were and would stay there if we're in Honolulu again!

Btw, I believe they have fireworks at Waikiki beach on Friday nights. We saw them from our main balcony.","Date of stay: June 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

As user I always read about the hotels here on Trip Advisor before going anywhere, and after reading the reviews I opted for the Trump.

I've made a reservation for the Trump Floor 1 Bedroom Suite because of the view (Trump Floor Suites are on the top 3 floors of the building - 35th 36th and 37th). At check-in we were surprised with an upgraded to the Trump Floor 2 Bedroom Suite, with great views of both sides (the city and the ocean), 2 balconies, with a table and chairs in one of them and lounge chairs in the other one. The suite is very large and well appointed with a nice decoration. As a Trump Floor guest we had juices, soft drinks, chocolates and plenty of fruit waiting for us when we arrived the suite, and it's all complimentary, so is the wi-fi...

The hotel is very well located, a short walk to the main avenue with all those shops and restaurants, Hard Rock Cafe, Outback, Starbucks, Mc Donald's, Burger King, Subway and many more, you are a short walk from everything. 
The beach is 1 block away and they have beach service there, just ask the Concierge where to find them before going to the beach and don't forget to get your beach bag with water, fruit, sunscreen and towels (very nice touch).

Buffet breakfast was very good (for my taste) with a nice variety of food ($32 p/p). I didn't have lunch or dinner at the hotel so I cannot comment on this. The hotel also offer a narrow pool, a fitness center and a SPA. The lounge on 6th floor is very cozy and welcoming.

Only rent a car to visit other beaches like Waimea, Pipeline and Sunset (on the North Shore), the east side of the island (very beautiful too) and to go to Diamond Head and Arizona Memorial. These are the places where you better get a car to go.

The hotel service is impecable, the staff is very helpful and they always do their best to help you with anything you need, they are all very kind.

From the moment we arrived the staff could not be faulted, the room was absolutely fantastic, we upgraded to the ocean view and even on the 19th floor the view of Waikiki beach and the Pacific ocean was a joy to wake up and see everyday. No detail has been overlooked, a very well equipped kitchen, with an ice making machine in the fridge. You really could do self catering very easily, although with the excellent BLT downstairs and several excellent places to eat nearby, it was nice to do a bit of both. Beach bags were a nice touch with water, fruit, sunscreen and towels you just had to request one from the concierge. The only downside if I had to be very picky was the size of the infinity pool, more for cooling off than swimming but with the beach and beautiful warm ocean literally steps from the hotel, it wasn't that much of an issue.","Date of stay: July 2012","Trip type: Traveled on business","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Can't wait to get back there","Everything about the Trump International was fantastic.  We arrived after a 10 hour flight from Sydney for our two week stay, and were greeted with happy and willing staff who grabbed our heavy luggage from the taxi and took care of it from there.  We were escorted up to the lobby and presented with watermelon flavoured iced water and hot towels, which were VERY welcome!!  Our room wasn't quite ready, as we had arrived three hours before check-in time, but we were told to come back in an hour, and sure enough, our room was ready for us!  And what a room it was!!  We were on the 16th floor in a one bedroom plus den ocean view suite.  This suite had it all - full kitchen with microwave, cooktop, dishwasher, large fridge/freezer, front load washing machine and dryer, walk-in robe, massive ensuite with large tub, shower and twin vanities, plus another bathroom with shower, toilet and vanity, magnificent king size bed in the large bedroom, plus pull-out double sofa bed in the den, 6 seat dining setting, lounge and flat screen tv's in the lounge, bedroom and den.  Not to mention the stunning views!!  Our lanais (yes, two of them!) were facing the Hilton Hawaiian Village, so we had front row seats to the Friday night fireworks from the supreme comfort of our room.

As far as the other facilities in the hotel go, the business centre came in VERY handy, and even though there are only two computers in there, we very rarely had any trouble getting on one.  If you have your own laptop or tablet, there is free wi-fi throughout the hotel, so you may not even need to use the business centre.  Another bonus - there is a printer which was always stocked with paper, so if you need to print your boarding passes you could.  The gym was great - bikes, eliptical and treadmills, plus three different types of complimentary flavoured water.  We didn't use the pool, but even though it is small, it looked good to us!

We had one breakfast buffet at In-Yo, which was excellent, and in a great spot right near the pool with views.

If you are staying for more than a couple of days, here are a couple of tips:- take advantage of the complimentary pillow menu (yes, seriously!).  Well worth it.  As there were three of us (women), I was worried about having enough clothes hangers, but we were pleasantly surprised that we could order more from the Trump Attache at no extra charge.  

One thing I didn't like - there was nowhere to hang your used towels in the bathrooms.  They are taken away morning and evening, but sometimes you would be happy to use them more than once and there was just no option for this unfortunately.  Also, if you are staying in a room like ours, I was in the Den and there was absolutely nowhere for me to unpack anything without encroaching on the main bedroom, which got pretty annoying for a two week stay.  A chest of drawers would have been very much appreciated.The sofa-bed in the den was reasonably comfortable, but I wouldn't recommend it for any more than maybe three nights.  My co-travellers said the king sized bed was the best they had ever slept in.

To summarise: - this hotel is in an excellent position, with two bus stops less than 100 metres away, and taxis right downstairs.  Eggs n Things is a five minute walk up the road, and the main street, Kalakaua Avenue a further minute away.  The staff are absolutely brilliant in every way.  The ladies I travelled with weren't used to using a coffee machine (we're Aussies!) and requested an electric jug instead, and one was brought up within ten minutes - excellent!!  The nightly turn down service is a treat!  They turn down the bed, leave you with Mr Trump's own bottled water, replace towels and tidy the kitchen, replacing tea, coffee, sugar etc.  If you are heading to the beach, the complimentary beach bags with fruit, towels, water and suncreen were a nice bonus.

This hotel is not beachfront, but given the right room, I'm sure anyone would be thrilled with the ocean views.  Yes, it is a bit expensive, but it is well worth spending the extra money to stay in Honolulu's Number 1 rated - and newest - hotel, and not hard to see why it is Number 1.  I can't wait to get back there, and will definitely be staying back at the Trump!!","Date of stay: May 2012","Trip type: Traveled with friends","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We made reservations at BLT Steak for dinner one night and we must have caught them on an off night. We had a later reservation and they had sold out of a lot of the entree selections already, so our choices were limited.  We decided on a filet, and it came undercooked and had to be sent back.  The service was fantastic, but the food left us slightly disappointed. I will say, however, that the popovers were fantastic!  The hotel staff was very accommodating during our stay, even providing us with wonderful sack brunches when we weren't able to make breakfast due to an early tour departure.  They also acknowledged my birthday with a sweet note, champagne, and cookies.

I see why this hotel is #1 and would not hesitate to stay here again and have already recommended it to several friends. The staff was awesome, the food was delicious, the view was amazing, the drinks were strong and tasty, and the location was perfect. 

The best part of this place is probably their employees, my wife was determined to run a 5k on the opposite side of the island early on Saturday morning. They bent over backwards helping her figure out a way to get there without spending $200 on taxis or rental cars. They were amazing from the time we checked in, till the time we were walking out the door.

I never heard anyone explaining  what they cannot do .  I felt the staff was trying everything they can, to make my stay comfortable. YES was the answer to every need .
Living in Hawaii for 23 years, this is a true and positive example on what a guest should expect from the ""Aloha Spirit"".

The hotel is across from the Halekulani, Waikiki Shore and Outrigger Reef hotels. You look straight into these neighbor oceanfront hotels from most rooms, or from the pool deck. You get a nice view from this 36 story building - it's just not oceanfront.

You're in walking distance to anywhere in Waikiki - excellent location.

The rooms are fully equipped apartments. I stayed at a studio with a full kitchen.
 I did not use the kitchen amenities, but would have loved to have a mini bar. The refrigerator was empty, but two bottle of water were standard and given during their turn down service.

The beds were super comfortable, and I had an excellent night sleep. 
My room had a real desk and work chair,  a sofa, and a coffee table.

The only phone was on the desk. I did not see a phone by the bed.

Bathroom: The marble floor was nice, very clean and towels were white, soft and I found more than plenty. I forgot my tooth brush and was pleased to see amenities were readily available.
The lightning was bright. I was kind of hoping for a jacuzzi bathtub with a TV  and a raindrop shower- but I guess there's room for improvement even in the nicest property.

The hotel is expensive compared to other Waikiki hotels, but you pay for the excellent service and super clean facilities.

The pool on the 5th floor facing a busy street was a bit noisy. The lounge chairs were plenty, but a soft mattress would have been an improvement. 

The pool area included a small jacuzzi.  I was hoping a five star properties with the rates you pay at the Trump may  include sauna, jacuzzi, steam rooms and a computerized gym, but I did not find this here. The gym was rather average and relatively small. The gym was very clean and working out was pleasant - and I welcomed ice water and headsets that were readily available.

Free wireless internet was available anywhere in the hotel.

I  was trying to make a dinner reservation t at the Steak house, but wasn't able to get a table n until 9.15 pm. I  went to a near by restaurant instead. 

I had a double expresso at the pool bar. The expresso was excellent,  but a base price of $10.00  was over the top. Where was the cookie? 
In addition the hotel added a mandatory tip (18%) and charged Hawaii State Taxes also on the tip. I found this rather unusual. 

I asked the  beverage manager, and he was thankful for my comments and took the $12.58 expresso charge off my bill. 

The hotel had a library and a very nice conference room - but I did not see an executive lounge.
Breakfast was not included, so I went to Starbucks across the street for a pastry and a $2 expresso.

If this hotel was in Asia, I would have given it 4 stars. For  Waikiki  the Trump Waikiki deserves a 5 star rating.","Date of stay: June 2012","Trip type: Traveled solo","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Our room was two bedroom plus den. The bed in the master bedroom was so comfortable I want to get one. Seriously comfortable. 

This room was huge! Much bigger than expected. The master bedroom itself was enormous, and so was the en suite.

Of the three bathrooms, two had bath tubs. The master bedroom's tub was absolutely massive. The shower wasn't great though and we used the other two bathrooms to shower in. 

The second bedroom was also very spacious with a large en suite.

The hotel provided two baby cots for our youngest two children - a smaller cot for our 6 month old, and a full sized cot for our 2 year old. These were both proper wooden cots with bumpers and thick mattresses (not the horrible portacots/pack-n-plays that hotels sometimes provide). 

The kitchen was spacious and well equipped. 

Quite honestly, I didn't see the point of the den before we arrived, but I was so wrong - it is such a great area for the kids to use.

There were two balconies both with beautiful ocean views each accessed via solid, heavy double glazed doors. I was concerned being so high up with such young children. But there was simply no way they could have opened them. It felt very secure.

The twice-daily maid service was amazing, and was so discreet we dubbed them ""house elves"".

They seem to have thought of just about everything to make your stay as comfortable and easy as possible. For example, they provide great beach bags (including fresh towels, sunscreen, water, fruit); and at the pool they provided disposable infant swim nappies (complimentary) another added bonus I have not encountered anywhere else we have stayed previously.

The infinity pool was one area of the hotel that was disappointing. Especially when compared to the two hotels next door, both of which had large pools and sun decks which could be seen from our pool. Which was quite small, as well as shady and windy on several occasions.

However, the location of the hotel (ignoring the fact it is not right on the beach) is excellent. There are so many good restaurants and shops in that part of Waikiki. We have always stayed down the other end of Waikiki previously, and I prefer the location of Trump.

Even though the pool was disappointing, I cannot rate this hotel less than 5/5 because it is simply excellent... Managed incredibly well. Excellent staff. Gorgeous and comfortable room. Fabulous maid service. Amazing food (BLT Steak - best steak ever). Family-friendly. Super smart yet unpretentious. Great location. We simply loved it.

It did have more of an apartment feel to it but it was perfect for some peace and quiet.
The staff were all extremely friendly and helpful but never over imposing.

We ate a couple of meals at the BLT Restaurant(part of Trump hotel) and was very impressed with the food and service. 

Any excursions we booked(Kauloa Ranch movie tour, Blue Hawaii Helicopter tour of Kauai Island, Golf at Hawaii Kai Golf course) through the Concierge who were superb with handling all our arrangements.

The poolside is very nice and although not a massive pool it is ideal for doing a few lengths, if your looking for a bigger swimming experience i would suggest the Pacific Ocean less than 100m from the hotel :-), also the concierge supply a beach bag free of charge which contains towels, sun cream, fruit and water.

The Hotel location is perfect for access to Waikiki beach although not directly on the beach itself, shopping and entertainment are all on the doorstep.

like most everybody else, i got an upgrade from a superior studio w/ city view to a deluxe suite w/ ocean view. the room was big, clean, and comfortable.  it was a really nice surprise to our amazing trip! housekeeping twice a day was great and you can always get free bottle water at the bell desk (2 bottles will be put in the room with turn down service). the complimentary beach bag was a nice gesture as well (w/ towels, water, fruit)

the staff were very friendly and helpful. i had requested for a late check out because my flight was  @ 7:30pm. the night before my departure they informed me that they could not fulfill my request, but they will try their best to get me a hospitality room to stay to 5pm.  so the day of my departure i got a confirmation that they were able to move me to another room, so i didn't have to check out until 5pm and they didn't charge me a penny for that!!!

we have dined at the in-yo cafe for breakfast one morning to use the $50 food credit i got with my rate. personally i like the buffet a lot and everything was very nice. the bill came out to be around $80 with tips so i was expecting the for a $30 charge when i check out, but they told me the credit has took care of the whole bill.  even tho it wasn't a lot of money but it just made the stay more enjoyable.

i have absolutely nothing to complain about this hotel. i can see why some people will have an issue with the smaller pool area and not right off the beach (which i personal don't think it's a problem). this hotel is modern, upscale and located in a great location, i will definitely stay at this hotel again when i return.","Date of stay: June 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Although the hotel is not actually on the beach, it is about a short 5min walk to the beach (via Outrigger) ... with  no vendors hawking their goods in the lobby as some of the other beach fronts in the area.

It's the little things that count, the wet towel and refreshing glass of water while you check in.  The staff who literally fall over themselves to help you out.  Dean was extremely helpful down at the front entrance, and went out of his way to make our stay as logistically simple and elegant as possible.

We booked a premium partial ocean view suite and received a complimentary upgrade to full ocean view.  The rooms are generously sized and appointed immaculately.  One feels that the Donald has personally approved of every tile, every tap fitting and fibre of carpet.  The decor is very smart, dark wood, marble and so on.  Very smart. 

The kitchen is generous, with top of the range appliances, two huge sinks, granite benchtops...  the list goes on.  The only thing we missed was an ice maker (beware the $10 bucket of ice from room service!)

Bathroom has a wet area, which isn't everyone's thing, but I personally like.  Huge bath that fills rapidly.  Dual sinks for his and hers.  Again, every tap, every tile is quality and perfect.  There were more towels than you can imagine, and the ""Trump"" embroidered robes were a hit with the wife. 

The bed was like falling into a pit of goose down.  

The only negative comment I'd have is that the breakfast was convenient, but there really was nothing separating it from any other continental breakfast we've had in a decent hotel.  Given the rest of the Trump experience, it was a touch disappointing, moreso because my wife ordered a pot of tea (her morning ritual) and it never arrived, despite her following up the request some minutes later.    

BLT however, for dinner, is simply brilliant.  Again, the staff make the place, but the food stands alone to provide the perfect dining experience.","Date of stay: June 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We only stayed 3 nights and treated this as a late Anniversary present for ourselves. At mention of this on my online reservation, we scored an upgrade and a half from a studio to a 1 bedroom with den. This was the room I had actually wanted to book because of the 2 lanais (one with chaise loungers), but at 2X the price of the studio I had opted against it. The upgrade was unexpected and gracious. Gracious is what we continued to experience throughout our stay. I had booked the room with breakfast included, but had forgotten to indicate the correct # of guests when booking the room. So, we were short breakfast tickets on checkin. I asked about it and they explained my mistake and then proceeded to give us the rest of the tickets complimentary, anyway. This was totally my fault, but they righted the situation for free. 

As we were sorting through our stuff on the last day I also discovered a free massage coupon, which I could kick myself for not seeing earlier. We didnt get to take advantage of that or the free bottle of wine offered as another Anniversary gift. Again, on the gracious scale, the Trump scores high!

We did take advantage of the breakfast buffet and the pool area.  The staff were super accommodating at both. The buffet offered omelets to order and french toast in addition to the rest of the spread, which was nice. The selection was good (not great) and diverse to cover Asian and American pallets. Great papaya juice...the coffee was a letdown, though. In fact, the only somewhat disappointing thing about this place was the crummy coffee (stabux across the street, though).  

At the pool, the staff greeted us with towels, took our drink orders and were as chatty (or not) as you liked.  I do warn you to get there before lunch if you want chairs in the sun. We got there around 1:30 and sat in the shade for an hour before being able to jockey for sun chairs. THe pool is also really just a single lane lap pool, which would have been great except for the 5 people that were splashing around...no laps for me:).

The views from our room were great and the location is perfect. We walked all over Waikiki night and day, enjoying the beach, restaurants, shopping and sight seeing. 

Our room was nice, but starting to show signs of age. These are all owned residences that the Trump manages the rental stuff on. The carpet needed cleaning and there was some signs of wear in the bathroom that were not what you would expect if it were a Trump owned hotel room.  The 1 bedroom with den was enough for 6 people (2 pull outs plus the bedroom). Our bed was very comfortable, but not quite a Westin 'heavenly bed' but very close. Spacious with well appointed kitchen and bathrooms - 2 baths with showers was really nice.  There was no noise to speak of and our room was right across from the elevators.The ceilings are low and it feels like a Mary Tyler Moore apartment when you first walk in, but unless you're looking to buy, you totally overlook that as everything else is so wonderful here. Trump has earned my trust and if I'm in a city with a Trump property I'll probably look there first over the Fairmont or any other top line property.","Date of stay: June 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Great pool service!","We stayed at this hotel for a night, just before returning to CA.  It was a great place to stay, very clean and very nice.  From the very beginning as we entered the first floor reception, we were greeted and everything was handled for us.  Our car was parked and we were immediately checked in to our room and escorted there.  Our luggage arrived almost immediately.  This arrival experience was just what we needed - we felt so pampered!

The room was large and modern, with a full kitchen in the entry hall, including nice dishes and wine glasses, fully equipped.  The bathroom was one large room with two sinks and an open shower.   Toilet was not separate, which wasn't ideal but that was fine.  Also, there was a high-accuracy scale in the bathroom.

The bed was amazing - sort of like the Heavenly Beds that they have at the Westin Hotels.  You can choose from several types of pillows when making the reservation, to customize the sleeping experience.  Nice!

The sitting area is between the bed and the balcony.  It was very modern and comfortable with a flat screen TV.  We spent most of our time sitting on the balcony, though, because the view was so beautiful.  The balcony was completely private, unlike some places.  The room was really quiet too.

The pool is on the fourth floor, kind of like a Vegas hotel.  It's made for dipping and sunbathing, not laps, as it is in an almost maze-like shape.  That makes for a nice place to hang out and the service there was very complete including food and bar delivered to your chair.  You can choose shaded areas or sunny places.  The chairs were very nice with good covers and very comfortable too.  I had a most excellent sashimi lunch that was very fresh.  I wish I could have spent more time there!

The hotel is on the main strip, and an easy walk/jog to Diamond Head for doing the loop in the morning.  You can stop at Lulu's on the way back for a ""recovery beer"".  ;-)

It's behind a park, but the view was very nice and the location was convenient.  I'm not big on sand/beach, so I didn't miss the beachfront.  Pictures below.

We also had a great dinner at BLT Steakhouse for our last night in HI, and ate the leftovers for breakfast on the balcony with some eggs (steak and eggs).","Date of stay: March 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We wanted quality service and a quiet, clean room.  We were pleasantly surprised by staff when we arrived at the hotel, staff greeted us at the shuttle service and took our bags.  We were each given a shell lei and escorted to the sixth floor to sign in.  We were given water and wet towels to cool off while we waited.  Since we were staying a week, staff upgraded our superior studio room to a deluxe room no charge.  We were given a room right over the pool.  We could see the ocean from our deck.  As in previous posts, staff came in twice a day to clean and turn down service the room.  It's the little things that count with this hotel.  Each and every staff smlled or greeted us the week we stayed.  A relative treated us to a Trump Spa gift certificate which was delivered by staff.  If you have time, do the Spa package.  It was relaxing! There is an in-room safe which after we mistyped the code we had to call the front desk for it to be re-set.  Staff was up within ten minutes to reset the safe.  Later the front desk called to ensure the service was to our satisfaction.   On the last day, the hotel offered us a hospitality room to stay in since our plane didn't leave until 11 pm.  This gave us one more day to do things in Waikiki and then return to the room to shower and get ready to travel.  All at no extra charge. Never once did I feel unsafe, or feared bed bugs or encountered rude staff.  It was worth every penny.  Read the reviews, there are good reasons Trump is rated #1 for hotels in Waikiki.","Date of stay: May 2012","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

It was more like a one bedroom though - full marble kitchen with every imaginable appliance, huge bathroom with very deep marble bath and a sofa/sitting area as well as the kingsize bed (which is the most comfortable bed we have ever slept in)
We were on floor 12 and had a view of the ocean from the balcony even though we didn't request this and had just booked a standard city view. 
Although we arrived early in the morning we still weren't able to get into the room until right on 3pm so we decided to have lunch at the ""In-Yo"" restaurant on the pool level. Don't both going there - over priced for average food. We should have guessed this beforehand as there was NO other people dining for lunch. A glass of juice will set you back $8.50. The girls behind the counter were a bit pre-occupied eating the cocktail garnishes behind the serving area to bother with good service. They seemed bored and unfriendly compared to the rest of the great staff around Trump. Save yourself the dollars and the boredom by going to eat down the street.
Aside from that our stay was great. The room was serviced twice daily to a very high standard, considering the state we left it in after shopping, swimming etc. 
The room was very quiet and we did not hear a peep from the street, other rooms or the corridors. The location is great - close to the high end side of town with heaps of great restaurants to choose from and close enough to walk to Ala Moana shopping centre. The beach is a minutes walk away. 
The pool is great -  cool drinks, Ipads and Kindles are all on offer for use. There are fresh beach towels and great changing/toilet facilities also. I have read people whinging about the pool being small. It is not that small and seriously if you are going to Hawaii to hang around a hotel pool then there is something wrong. The bigger the pool the more kids and bogans I say!
Trump is totally different from the other resort style hotels offered in Waikiki. It doesn't have the tackiness, overcrowded pools, pigs at buffets or loud crass footy groups that you see at other hotels. It is quiet, classy, low key and quality. Having stayed at other places in Waikiki we can't recommend it highly enough and will definitely be returning.","Date of stay: May 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I told the reception staff who are all very courteous and helpful and was immediately upgraded to an even nicer room on the 23rd floor.

We turned this trip into a family trip and brought our college age sons. That said, our arrival and our stay were seamless.  Our flight was delayed by several hours. Carey Transportation and the front desk were on top of it. When we arrived, we were greeted by name and escorted to the front desk. Check in was a breeze. The one bedroom suite had everything that one would need and if it wasn't there, call and it would be provided. The convenience of the washer and dryer in the unit was perfect.  One of our suitcases was left in the rain and the dryer came in handy.  This is a residence type hotel. There are amenities in other hotels you won't find here, but that said, there are amenities here that you won't find elsewhere.  Usually when we travel to O'ahu, we stay at the Hale Koa across the street. We ate most of our meals here during our three days.  Meals at trump are expensive. A buffet breakfast is $32 compared to the buffet breakfast at the Hale Koa for $13. The pool area was lovely.

The hotel is located within a very short walking distance to a beautiful outdoor shopping area with many luxury shopping stores and restaurants and across the street from Waikiki Beach. Upon arrival, the staff greeted us warmly with a lei and check in was easy and problem free. The room was very clean and nicely designed. The alarm clock sounded amazing (ihome ipod alarm clock). They had some relaxing music playing when we walked in to our room. The kitchenette was a big plus to the room! This allowed us to save some money on vacation by being able to eat left overs and make snacks in the room. The shower was a huge open shower. Beautiful in grey and white marble! The spa and workout room were beautiful and very clean. I only wish that the pool was bigger (or that they had a second pool) and that the glass wall around the pool (the pool is on the 6th floor of the hotel) was taller to block more of the breeze. It gets very windy on the 6th floor! The hotel staff was very polite and if the elevator showed up on their floor for them to get in, they would greet you with ""Aloha"" and would not get on the elevator with you. They would wait for the next one. I thought this was very polite. The staff helped us setup a tour to the Cultural Center and everything was perfect. We are very picky about hotels and find that this one was very clean, beautifully designed, and in a great location. Every morning upon walking out of the hotel, the staff would greet us warmly and were more than happy to help with directions or anything we needed. The elevators were fast, yet not jolting. We walked through a couple of the other local hotels and they were not nearly as beautiful or clean as the Trump. We highly recommend this hotel.

From the time you check in you feel special. They greet you with orange and jasmine infused water. They also give you a beaded Hawaiian necklace.  The guy who checked my husband and I in was very friendly and escorted us all the way to our hotel room and explained how things in the room worked and when things were open within the facility. He asked us if we were celebrating anything special on our trip and we mentioned that it was our anniversary. There were delicious cookies from the Honolulu Cookie Company waiting for us in the room which was spacious and nicely decorated (nothing overly modern or over the top). Really nice! The beds were so comfy and plush that when we had the blackout shades pulled we could hardly get out of bed in the morning. Our room had a full stove, microwave, fridge, pots, pans, utensils, plates, the works. Great for warming up leftovers or cooking a light meal.  Later on the first day, we were given some chocolates and a postcard saying Happy Anniversary and letting us know that a complementary bottle of champagne was waiting for us in the downstairs lounge. We thought that was a great touch. You can walk right to the main shopping area in Waikiki from the hotel. No need to drive. You can also walk right onto the beach. I don't think I would recommend this hotel for families with children since the pool was small and clearly just for adults to wade and sun themselves. No playing really possible in that size pool. The staff was super friendly. Every single person (maid, valet, reception, janitor) that worked there always greeted us when we passed by. They all acknowledged us warmly.

There are cookies and juice available for guests at the elevator every day, the welcome with the shell leis are lovely and every request is accommodated with no fuss whatsoever. We changed from the Outrigger Reef because the service there has gone completely downhill. It's so great to be able to get the service you want when you are on vacation. No request was too small or too big and we didn't ask for much. The pool staff were always anticipating needs and did everything they could to be proactive. The rooms are beautiful with high end finishes and very comfortable beds. Furnishings are modern and sleek. The only thing that was a little different in our studio unit was the high bathtub you had to hike over to get into the bath/shower combo. Other than that no complaints.

There were two couples traveling and we each had deluxe partial ocean view rooms on the 20th floor. None of us have a bad thing to say about this hotel.

The room is spacious with a very comfortable king bed, sitting area, desk and flat-screen TV. The bathroom is large with a very nice open shower (with very good pressure), nice soaker bath tub and double sinks. The kitchen has a toaster, microwave, stove top, coffee maker and refrigerator. We found this to be particularly useful on mornings we wanted to stay in and enjoy breakfast on our lanai.

I was skeptical about ""partial ocean view"" but was blown away when we opened the curtains and lanai doors and saw the stunning view of the ocean. We could lie in bed and stare outside and see the waves rippling in the ocean. Absolutely beautiful. The lanai was also very nice and provided complete privacy.

Service was impeccable. Everyone we dealt with at the hotel always greeted us with a smile on their face and was extremely helpful.

We ate breakfast at the in-hotel In Yo Cafe twice and had drinks at Wai-Olu Lounge. Both were pricey but very nice. 

Everything about this hotel makes you feel like you are being pampered and living the life of luxury. We were greeted with beautiful shell lei, pineapple infused water, cold towels and cookies from the Honolulu Cookie Company in our room. I disagree with those who say this hotel lacks ambiance. The Trump feels Hawaiian without being dated. The hotel is beautiful and modern.

We spent every morning by the pool and loved it! The view from the pool is beautiful (nice place to watch the fireworks on a Friday night). Yes it isn't huge but it was more than enough for us. We loved how quiet and relaxing the pool area was compared to other hotels. We didn't have to rush in the morning to find loungers and there is ample shaded and sunny area on the pool deck to satisfy everyone.

I'm frustrated by those who complain about the hotel not being on the beach - if you do any amount of research at all before booking you would know this. The location was the best part. You are literally a crosswalk away from the beach (the Trump is right behind the Outrigger Reef) and on the other side, you are right by Lewers and Kalakaua for endless restaurant and shopping choices. We never had to walk far to get anywhere!

We have traveled to Honolulu many times and have often stayed at the Hilton Village but will be staying at the Trump from now on. If you're looking to make a decision, I highly recommend the Trump.

Also, the hotel is located about a block from the beach -- not directly on the beach. When we stood near the sliding glass door or out on the balcony, we could see the ocean in between the other highrises. The location is only two blocks from Kalakaua Avenue -- the main shopping street with loads of restaurants. The infinitypool is on the sixth floor roof and was fine for this downtown location.

We had considered a few hotels in Honolulu and decided to stay at both the Surfrider and Trump (both for four nights). We also considered Halekulani (but this was still undergoing renovation so not an option for us) and the Pink Palace (but they only had smoking rooms left so again, not an option for us).

I was really looking forward to my stay at Trump as I had read fabulous reviews and noted its position as the number one hotel in Waikiki. Initial impressions were good - we were greeted by lovely shell leis and escorted to the check in desk by a member of staff. Whilst we were checking in she brought us cool and refreshing towels and a cool drink. Check in was fast and efficient. We had booked a deluxe ocean view room with lanai. When I entered the room I was a bit disappointed with the size - compared to the Surfrider, it was smaller - not significantly smaller but the space felt tight. I was also a bit disappointed with the ""ocean view"" - yes we had a view of the ocean but really it was obscured by at least 50% by the hotels in front of us. We had booked a partial ocean view at Surfrider and that view was much better. I was pretty disappointed but moved on. The bed itself is comfortable and they had a pillow menu section which was nice. The bathroom was a really great size with a double sink. The shower was unusual in that it was open with no screen and next to the bath. I thought that water would splash everywhere in the bathroom but it didn't so obviously it was designed quite well despite the look. The kitchenette was very handy. 

Onto the housecleaning - we didn't think that the housecleaning was up to the level that others had written about. We felt that all the housekeepers did was make the bed up and refresh the towels. We had forgotten to leave a tip the first day so I thought it may have been that, but we left a tip every other day and the level of housekeeping did not change. Overall, housekeeping was just average and definitely not to the standard of what you would receive for example in a five store hotel in Asia. They even left a dirty dish and glass in the sink! I was a bit astounded at that.

Another reason why I did not rate this as ""great"" is that this hotel really lacks any ambience. Some reviewers mentioned that it is just like a condo and not a resort - this hits the nail on the head. Maybe the Surfrider is older and sure the rooms aren't fantastic but boy does it have presence and a great ambience! Trump lacks all of this. Also although they provide beachside concierge services meaning you can reserve a chair and umbrella on the beach (we did this 2 of the 4 days) the service isn't as great as if you were staying at a beachfront hotel. For example, at the Surfrider you can book your chairs but then they have wait staff come around and take drink and food orders and that to me is what a beach holiday is about. Also, the part of the beach that the Trump beach concierge is located is not that great - the sand is quite rough with lots of little shells and particles and there is a reef almost straight away. Surfrider and Pink Palace have by far the best location in Waikiki (in my opinion). The beach concierge man was very nice and friendly and helpful and let us move chairs when a beachfront one became available. 

I actually really liked the pool area at Trump! Yes it is small but it's very relaxing as it's not too busy and the pool itself is lovely. Yes children play in the pool but you can easily swim around them. Also the pool area has a delightful balcony where you can lie on the beach chairs and watch the sun go down.

Overall I would rate my experience at Trump as good (not really very good but I thought it was better than ""average"") but it is definitely not a ""great"" hotel. The main reason is that there is no hawaiian ambience - but for the leis that they give you, you could be staying at the city hotel. If I had to choose again, I would not stay here if I was on my honeymoon. I would definitely choose the Surfrider or the Pink Palace because you cannot beat that location (the Halekulani's beach area is far too small for my liking and you cannot set beach chairs on their beach). The only advantage that Trump has over other hotels is that if you have a family (I don't) it may be worthwhile as all the rooms have kitchens. That is the only advantage.

I know my review is very long but I wanted to give people my honest and complete feedback of the hotel.","Date of stay: May 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

The Waikiki location is no exception when it comes to simply the best service of any hotel chain I've visited.  The staff at these hotels go out of their way to make sure you enjoy your stay - this place is no exception.  In addition, the decor and the furnishings are all 5-star (Trump) worthy.

However, I have to agree with some another reviewers remarks that stated this hotel is a great place to stay, but it's not on the beach, it has very limited views of the ocean, and to be honest I just don't think it has the wow-factor that the other Trump hotels have.  

Dont' get me wrong, while I've been traveling on business this trip I've enjoy my stay very much, but when i come back later with the family for a vacation, I will not be staying here.  The hotel just dosesn't quite do it for me as a resort hotel.  There are other fine resort hotels right on the beach.

However, if you're expecting a ""resort"", this isn't the place.  This is a Condo-Hotel.  The hotel pool is extremely small, and the property isn't really designed as the ""destination"" but only the accommodation.  For the price, this may not be enough for some travelers.

That said, the service is impeccable, and you will be royally treated from entry to exit.

The rooms all have mini-kitchenettes (of very high quality) with stove, microwave, small fridge with icemaker, and most if not all have balconies (Lanai's).  The icemaker is at the very bottom of the fridge and it's an item they may forget to tell you about, so look for it unless you wish to call for ice.

Although one block off the beach, the Trump provides beach bags with towels, fruit, sunblock, and water to take with you and they have a partnership with one of the umbrella vendors at the beach who will do things through room charges.  Like most things in Hawaii, beach umbrellas and chairs are fairly expensive (ranging from $35 to $45 a day), but the folks work hard to make sure you're taken care of.","Date of stay: April 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

From the moment we were greeted at the car door, to when we were waved off at the end the service was always exceptional. When we arrived we were greeted with a lei each and welcomed by name. And the cool towels and complementary drink are a nice touch. Although we were 2 hours early for check-in this was of no trouble to them as they took us to reception. We had booked a premium king room with sea view, and I had requested a high floor. We were upgraded to a 1bedroom Sea View Suite with Den which was huge! 2 lounge areas, kitchen, 2 balconies, 2 bathrooms, deep soaking tub looked out through floor to ceiling french windows to the sea and the views to the ocean were fantastic! The infintiy pool on the 5th floor really is not done justice by the pictures. Yes it is relatively small but was never busy! You could always find a patch of sun (particularly good in the afternoon so we always headed to the beach in the morning then the pool after lunch). The hotel is slightly set back from the beach behind a small park but you are talking a 1 minute stroll, and don't forget to pick up your daily beach bag from the concierge (who was also excellent, we spoke to him daily for advice, bookings, directions etc) which includes cool bag, towels, water, fruit and sun screen. We only ate in the hotel a couple of times as Waikiki has so much choice but the food we did eat was great and their 'World's best Mai Tai' is worth visiting for on it's own. Location is at one end of the beach just before the Hilton Hawaiian village, which is nice because it's slightly quieter but still right on the edge of all the shops and restaurants. I am glad we ended up here after many hours of internet research as I didn't see another hotel that topped it! Will definately return.
If you visit there are a few things I would thoroughly recommend:
'House with out a key' at the Halekulani (2 hotels along) - Beach front cocktail bar / restaurant, plays live traditional Hawaiian music every night from 7 with accompanying Hula dancer. Great fun for a couple of hours although I would recommend arriving before 6 if you want a seat!
Surfing Lesson - Loads along the beach, all excellent, and where better to learn.
Aloha Stadium swap meet - about a 15min drive from central Waikiki, $1 to park, great market for all your Hawaain essentials (shirts, jewellrey, ukelele etc) and a lot cheaper and seemingly more authentic (I'm sure they are probably not but is a more enjoyable experience) than town.
North Shore - You must take a drive around the island to the north shore to see alll the surf towns and fantastic beaches! The hotel have a suggested route to take that includes Pearl Harbour (free to enter and well worth a trip), Japanese Monestry, famous road side shrimp trucks and many other places.
Hawaii also has one of the US's lowest purchase taxes at about 4.8% so also a great place to shop.","Date of stay: April 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Our room was a 'standard' room but there was nothing standard about it. It was huge and fabulous! Goodness knows what the more luxurious rooms are like. We asked on arrival if an upgrade was available, they told us an upgrade would be available from the following night, but we were so happy with our room we didn't bother chasing it up.
The pool and area was very small, like a 'business' hotel, which is the downside to this place. But don't forget the greatest pool on earth is only a block away! It is very comfortable, top quality as you would expect, but the atmosphere doesn't really have that holiday vibe most visitors probably come to Waikiki for.
If that's not so important to you, you will enjoy the comforts of this excellent hotel, but for that holiday feeling, maybe consider splashing out (even more!) on the Royal Hawaiian, or a little less on the Outrigger Reef on the beach, or possibly the Ala Moana.
Finally, for anyone who has never been to Waikiki, it is not, surprise surprise, a little group of thatched huts on an idyllic beach, as some people may think! It is a big American city, with all the great things and not so great things that go with that. For that reason, all the hotels will have an element of 'city' ambience about them.","Date of stay: March 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Best 4 nights ever spent in Waikiki. Great location, close to Lewers st, and beach. Fort DeRussy park is great and just accross the street. Beach is surprisingly good and quieter than Waikiki and with all the things you need for a great beach day. The hotel was classy, service was 5 star from the time we checked in till the time we left. The hotel had none of that over commercialised in your face stuff like shops and tour desks and people trying to sell you something in the lobby. Great pool, very quiet, great pool deck service and could get a good feed and cocktail from pool deck. Got a bit breezey the day we spent up there, not sure if that is the norm or just a breezy day everywhere. On arrival we were upgraded to a suite, had a decent kitchen which gave us the opportunity to avoid the buffet breakfast trap. Room was huge, seperate bedroom, 2 sitting rooms. A good bar downstairs and a decent restaurant (BLT) good meals a bit pricey, service was o.k but for the price expected a bit more.

QANTAS Holidays messed up our booking dates so on arrival there was some concern over having a suitable room available.  The Reception Manager found a room and difussed the situation beautifully with an offer of complimentary cocktails and appetizers for us while we enjoyed the sunset and the new room was sorted - nice handling of it.
The ""Ocean View"" room we received was on the north western corner which really was very limited in terms of ocean views but the apartment's spaciuos living areas and amentities made this a minor detraction.
Thoughout the whole stay you could tell the staff was very well trained and attuned to providing top level service.

Each time we encountered any staff, they were genuinely friendly and helpful.
The pool is small, but the beach is a block away, so we had no need for a pool.
The turn down service was also very nice. I appreciated coming back to a freshly cleaned room in the evening. Especially since the walk in shower made the bathroom floors very wet.

We had originally planned to stay part of our trip at the Trump and part of our trip at the Moana Surfrider which is where we have stayed on previous trips but after spending our first 3 nights at the Trump we cancelled our Moana Surfrider reservation and booked extra time at the Trump. We were unable to fault it. We were welcomed to the Trump with shell lei's, refreshing fruit infused water and cool facewashers. All staff we encountered at the Trump were personable, polite and completely focussed on providing first rate customer service. In particular we had such fantastic help from Dashe at the front desk who assisted us in changing our reservations when we decided to stay. The Attache service is fabulous and willing to help with any request and the Concierge assisted us on several occasions to book tours and a rental car. The Trump is close to the shopping and restaurants on Kalakaua Avenue and we walked to Ala Moana shopping centre on several occasions. The rooms are spacious and comfortable and well appointed. Both of our rooms had lanai's (balcony's) and our first room had a small kitchen with a microwave and fridge and our second room had a full kitchen complete with a cooktop. Both rooms had a coffee maker with Honolulu Coffee Company coffee provided. Our second room also had a 'loungeroom' area. Housekeeping was faultless and we were given fresh towels several times a day and on one occasion when we requested extra towels we were given not just a set but a basket full of towels. We were given 'gifts' on arrival of coffee, a box of brownies and candies and some pineapple sugar and later in our stay we were given a tray of chocolates. The hotel is not beach front as reviews have previously stated but both of our rooms had beautiful ocean views and the beach is literally a 2 minute walk across the road. The Trump have considered all the things that make a customer feel important and valued and all things that make a stay comfortable for example the beach bags that are provided by the concierge desk containing water, towels, fruit and sunscreen and the ability to borrow Kindles and IPods from the pool deck. The pool is on the smaller side but it is impeccably kept and we never had trouble getting a lounge chair and we found if we went earlier in the day/lunchtime there were very few people there. We also loved the turndown service that included returning to the room with soft hawaiian music playing and bottled water provided. We had the opportunity to dine at BLT Steak and highly recommend it - delicious food (especially the popovers) and excellent service. Perhaps if there was one thing to fault it would be the buffet breakfast at In-Yo restaurant and by no means was it bad it just perhaps not worth the $32. We cannot recommend the Trump Waikiki highly enough and have already encouraged family and friends to stay there. I have no doubt it will be our new place to stay in Honolulu.","Date of stay: April 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

This Trump isn't affiliated with AMEX so we took a chance that the Trump would be better than the Halekalani where we stayed 2 years ago, and it was. Its newer, cleaner, more modern (technology), and the rooms are spacious and much better equipped with a kitchen, large bathrooms and washer/dryer.  The personal touches are notable including the treats (cookies/chocolate and fresh juices) left for us upon entering the room, the gourmet coffee and user friendly coffee pot (with milk in the fridge), and a couple of DVD's left for my son to watch.  The toiletries were great too. Oh, and lots of free bottled water.

We joined the Trump Program (free) which offers an upgrade if available -- granted to us when we checked in -- and free wi-fi  -- a luxury I'm now expecting at hotels (I've stopped staying at the Four Seasons for that reason alone).  We traveled with our 8 year old son and were pleasantly surprised that the pool and pool deck were lovely (from the reviews, we were concerned it would be too small and cramped.)  Even though the beach is a minimal walk, its close and the concierge sends you off with towels, water, and a fruit snack. The restaurant serves a fabulous breakfast buffet (which costs $32 for adults and $16 for kids but our son was often comp'ed) and the location of the hotel is ideal with close proximity to great shopping, restaurants and major roads to get out of town.

i spent there 10 days from 16.3.-26.3.2012.
i already have been there last year from 21.2.-1.3.2011

last year its been great enough to come again this year. but this time we had bad luck with the rooms.
i had reserved a room with 2 queensized beds. (as i had last year)
we got an even room than reserved for the lower price (oceanview instead of partial ocean view, but exactly same kind of room), but with 1 queensized bed and a incredible ridiculous joke of a sleepcouch with a mattress so thin, that you had to lie on the grid.
for a Hotel like the Trump an unbelievable joke.
the queensized beds are ok, but nothing special.

3 days later we got another room in the 10. floor and the other side. the room before was on the 19 floor (city+ocean-sided)
the view in the new room was really great, but the noise from the road was rather loud.
and in the morning(around 5:00 am) we were waked up by the noice of riding backwards trucks.
(in Amerika they do a real loud noice when riding backwards)

yes- you can shut the door. yes - you can use the air condition.
but in the other room and the room last year, it was not necessary. there we could let open the door, enjoying the hawaiian air and didn´t risk to get sick by air condition.

so my advice to everyone:
-try to get a room as high as possible.
(the cheaper ones go up to floor 23.)
-visit hawaii, when its not to overcrowded - the possibility to get a great room is a lot higher, because its not possible to get a fix reservation. you can only get a ""strong request"" to your rooms/wishes.

well - the rest of the hotel is really impressive and nice and the service is nearly perfect.","Date of stay: March 2012","Trip type: Traveled with friends","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

From the moment we arrived, the service was friendly and top-notch.  We were greeted with a kukui nut lei and escorted to the reception desk on the 6th floor.  Once check-in was complete, we were given a quick tour of the public/dining areas in the hotel and then shown to the elevator that would take us to our floor.  

I had booked an ocean view studio, but they upgraded us to a huge and beautiful 1 bedroom suite with a den, living and dining room, and full kitchen with granite countertops.  Our suite had two lanais with incredible panoramic views from the ocean to the mountains.  We even had views of the ocean from our extremely comfortable king bed.  Our suite was beautifully appointed and very quiet.  We loved the marble tiled bathroom with large soaking tub, separate walk-in shower and double vanities.  

Each day when the valet would bring our car around, they would always give us bottled water for the drive.  When we returned to our room each evening, the lights were dimmed, the bed covers turned down, slippers and robes laid out, and tranquil, Hawaiian music was softly playing.

We had a delicious and relaxing dinner at the Wai’olu Ocean View Lounge our last night, and the service from our waiter was impeccable!

We didn’t use the pool, but I do agree with other comments that it is rather small and more like a lap pool.

The hotel is located at the quieter end of Waikiki, with first class shopping and many excellent restaurants in the area.  The heart of Waikiki, as well as the beach and Fort Derussy Park are just a short walk away.  If you have a car, another plus of staying here is that you don’t have to fight the horrible traffic on Kalakaua Avenue in order to get in and out of the hotel.

I do quite a bit of traveling and have planned many events at high-end boutique hotels for my company.  Without a doubt, the Trump was one of the nicest experiences I’ve had in all of my travels.

We were upgraded to a much larger, beautifully appointed suite than we had requested and got to watch the sun go down and the Friday night fireworks from one of our two balconies! Our Saturday night flight did not depart until 8 pm and, on check-in, the staff assured us that there would be no problem nor any cost, to provide us with a hospitality suite. We packed up early, our suitcases were transferred to the suite which really gave us an extra day's vacation because we had a place to store our luggage, change/freshen up for the flight home and enjoy the sights of Waikiki for the entire day.","Date of stay: March 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Spacious living room, great appliances in kitchen, good utensils, pots and pans for cooking.  No spices, saran wrap or tinfoil.  

The pool on the 6th floor is pretty small and the sitting area gets pretty crowded.  The hotel is off the beach and requires a quick walk.  The beach conceirge is a seperate company that rents youu chairs, umbrellas, and equipment.  The website implies you can order food from BLT and have it delivered to the beach,  Never saw this option.  

They do provide a beach bag evaeryday with towels, fruit and water.  Greatt!!!!!!!

There is a washer/dryer in the unit.  The dryer took forever to dry a normal size load.

We were on the 20th floor and the wind made the lanai unuseable (not that TIH could control this).  Just FYI.

The unit was cleaned very well everyday.  The maids even organized our shoes.

Turndown service was disappointing to say the least.  They pull the sheets back and put the breakfast menu on your bed.  Then turn on a radio...... and that's it.  Having stayed at Trump International in Manhattan we were expectig the same turn down service (robes and slippers laid out , chocolates, lights dimmed, TV tuned to music and sheets pulled back).  Apparently they also do not perform turndown service on your last night.  

The bed was uncomfortably SOFT.  The pillows incredibly SOFT.  Not to our liking.

Overall, not a 5 star if compared to Trump International Manhattan.  As for value, I pay less for a similar room in Manhattan and get better value for money.  I would not stay here again in Waikiki.  But will stay nowhere else in NYC.

After four nights, I would look at one of the hotels right on the beach.","Date of stay: March 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

The staff is exceptional and helpful, which almost makes up for the hotel's lack of character and personal touch. The trump is a wonderful hotel but is sterile. On it's own it is a great place to stay but when compared to the Ala Moana Surfrider or Halekulani it becomes just another hotel comparable to a marriot or sheratton.

The hotel, rooms, service and restaurants are top notch. My friend and I decided we needed a quick getaway and we decided to take a long weekend to Hawaii. Trump International made our relaxing getaway perfect. We arrived late (10:30 PM) and check in was a breeze. The room was well appointed and the beds were extremely comfortable. The cookies that they provided in the room were also delicious! We started our day with breakfast at InYo Cafe which was pricey but extensive. The breakfast smoothies were delicious - try banana and guava - so good! We stopped in the lobby to pick up our beach bag (such a great idea!) and off we went. When we got to the beach, we went to the small Maui Jim desk to rent our loungers and umbrella. We were taken care of by Melvino and his crew who checked in with us from time to time to make sure we had everything we needed. The next day, we rented a paddle board and kayak from Melvino and his crew who again took great care of us. We had massages booked at the Spa at the hotel which was perfect after some exercise out in the surf. The therapists were both very good. The Spa does not have a sauna or steam room which is unfortunate but they did allow us use of the couples jacuzzi that they have in one of the couples rooms which was a nice touch and felt amazing! We had dinner at BLT Steak and the service and food were top notch. Our last day there, we had a very late flight and the hotel provided us a hospitality room just for us that we were given until 8 PM. This service was incredible! We were able to enjoy our entire last day on the beach, showered and had a nice light tapas dinner and watched the sunset from the Wai'olu Lounge before we headed to the airport. All of the employees at the hotel were helpful and friendly. An unbelieveable stay in Hawaii thanks to Trump International. We will definitely be back!","Date of stay: March 2012","Trip type: Traveled with friends","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Yes this hotel is worth the hype.  

The staff are so friendly and helpful.  After a long haul flight they went out of their way and gave us a courtesy room.  It was really great to have a shower before our actual room was ready.

We had a part ocean view, and was very pleased with the plush king size bed and pillows. Loved the marble free-standing shower - bonus points. (a pet hate of mine is a bath and shower combo). Not that we used the kitchen only to get a drink but the fit-out was great. 

I thought the infinity pool was great, I know people complain but we didn't have a problem with it being crowded or finding a lounger. We spent most of the time at the beach anyway. If you want a big pool for families I suggest the Sheraton with it's adults only and kids pools if this is the type of vacation you are after.

Room was great size. Definitely not your typical walk in and bump into the bed style room. This was just a standard room, but had a kitchenette, huge bathroom, comfy lounge/sitting area and extremely comfortable bed. No balcony though for the standard room. Hotel provided beach bags inc towels, water, fruit and sunscreen to use on request which was very handy. Only down size was the pool area. Pool area was fairly small. Bit more like a lap pool style, so was a bit overcrowded when little ones arrived. The pool deck was up a few floors so it was often very windy. Beach only across the road anyway so we went there most days. Service of staff was very friendly and efficient, especially the room maintenance staff- room always very clean/tidy on return. Nice turn down service at night so would return to a lit room with Hawaiian music playing softly on the radio which was a nice touch. Would stay here again if just my husband and I. On our last visit to Hawaii with our four daughters we stayed at Embassy Suites just virtually next door which was probably more family oriented, but Trump would suit couples better.","Date of stay: February 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

As others have shared in their reviews the service is outstanding and our suite was perfect for a week stay...roomy, lainai off the bedroom and LR, two roomy bathrooms. We enjoyed the restaurants in the hotel and would rate BLT Steakhouse even higher  than the lovely dinner we had at Roy's a short half block away.

We booked a resort hotel on Waikiki for our last 3 nights thinking we would miss not being on the beach but in hindsight I would have been very happy staying at Trump's the whole ten days! The location of Trumps is perfect to the beach, shopping and many nice restaurants. Also the bus service is excellent in Honolulu so we used public transportation from the hotel to Pearl Harbour and Diamond Head, costing 2.50 per person! Don't waste money on tours unless you need special assistance travelling.

Many reviews have discussed the infinity pool at Trumps' Hotel. I must say I am spoiled as we stayed last year at Maui Four Seasons and the infinity pool is gorgeous at the Four Seasons Maui. Also the Four Seasons has an adult only restriction for that pool and families with children have a separate pool area. However the Trump Hotel has only one pool area so the size of the pool  was not an issue for us so much as the children staying at the hotel dominated the pool area and hot tub. When you mix children and water the end result was a week of yelling, screaming, crying and splashing in the pool...oh with lots of pool toys! I noticed many adult couples like ourselves did not stay long at the pool as it was not a relaxing atmosphere around the pool to read and rest. I sound like I don't like children which is not the case but don't expect a quiet romantic pool area if that is high on your list of ""must haves"".

We loved Trumps' overall and would look for other Trump Hotels in our travels.","Date of stay: March 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

This is not one of the unwieldy mega resorts, but a world class hotel with great access to the fun Waikiki offers.

The staff was super super friendly and accommodating. They kept calling to see if we were comfortable. The concierge did a great job of making reservations for us and providing us with beach tips and places to go. 

The rooms were comfortably sized with balconies attached to the master bedroom and living room. The bed was a tad bit too soft for my liking. My mom in law actually used the carpet to sleep on because she has a very weak back. 

Downside: the pool was just tooo tooo small!! Would have preffered something bigger. 

I used the gym as well and that too was very spacious and had most of the equipment one would need, which is a good thing because the hotel has a large number of long-stay guests.

The service from the point you stop your car outside the hotel to the time you get into your rooms, was impeccable. It was so good it got a little over-bearing towards the end of the day. On the first day after we checked in, the staff provided us with welcome drinks and accompanied us all the way to the room whilst showing us all the amenities on the way. After we got into our room,  the reception left us a message on our phone welcoming us to the hotel and assuring us that she was a phone call away.

As we were pretty jet lagged, we spent the first day just sleeping and relaxing in our rooms, housekeeping visited us twice more after for the turn down service. The valet who picked up our car also placed fresh mineral water bottles in our car ! Talk about attention to details!
Anyway it was clear to me how trump got its high ratings, they have a bunch of staff who are very dedicated to their jobs ! 
The location of this hotel is not literally steps away from the main area shopping areas in Waikiki, it is also not directly in front of the beach but i believe it is located at the quieter, ""higher end"" side of the strip.

I never stayed with Trump before, so I have no idea why I was upgraded, but I was not about to question it!  My room was ready about an hour before the designated check-in time, but I had arrived early and was given a ""hospitality room"" to use until my room was ready.  This was a fully furnished hotel room complete with King bed, full bathroom and kitchenette - just to use for a couple of hours.  And how I appreciated it after the long travel day!!!   

The level of service of the check-in staff was above and beyond expectations.  Greeted right off by bell staff and directed to check-in.  The check-in staff was very friendly, helpful, and attentive.

The suite was impeccably clean, beautifully and functionally furnished, and the bathroom had a both a generously sized shower and tub.  I did not use the washer/dryer but would have appreciated that amenity if I had stayed longer than one night.  The room was very quiet - I never had to use the earplugs I always bring with me when I travel.

The walk to the beach is 2 blocks and there is a direct path, so not a big deal to me that I was not right on the beach.

I did not try the restaurants or spa on sight, but I will say that the spa toiletries included with the room were all of excellent quality.

So the area is not that busy, but of course you stay in a larger city and there is the usual city noise around like traffic or live music from surrounding hotels. 
Over all the Trump is awesome! The moment we arrived we were welcomed by very friendly staff members, which were always nice and helpful during our entire stay. We were upgraded to a 1bedroom suite that offered plenty of room for our family. What a nice surprise! We had a good room rate anyway since we had a 4th night free offer. I can also recommend signing up for the Trump card. I couldn't believe my eyes, when I saw that they really had taken care of all the things that I mentioned in my profile (e.g. I am a tea drinker, so an array of different teas was waiting and I like to sweeten my tea with honey so I also found a jar of that)...that was a very nice touch!
The suite was excellent equipped, the kitchen is a dream top notch appliances, the bathroom spacious! Although we were on the lower floors (12) we enjoyed spectacular partial ocean view. 
The kids were thrilled by their welcome package (a tray of drinks - milk, different juices -, cookies and a personalized letter with recommendations like the Honolulu Zoo etc.). The other guests at the hotel were a mix of families with kids, mostly business travelers and couples. Although the pool is small, fancy (infinity) and a bit windy, it is good enough for a plunge after a day of sight seeing. The beach is really just a few steps away and you'll get nice beach bags from the concierge with water, towels and fruit. 
We also enjoyed watching the sun set during happy hour in the lounge! Spectacular! 
For us, the Trump Hotel was the perfect spot to stay during our Waikiki vacation. The accommodation,  every single staff member and their service were outstanding. And most of all we felt very welcomed as a family! I also like that it is a smaller hotel without the usual shops and buzz in the lobby area. It has a SPA, a restaurant, breakfast cafe, too. We used to make breakfast ourselves in our room and had dinner once at the BLT steakhouse on site. 

The Trump hotel is very kid friendly, but it's not a family wonderland with pool lagoons, water slides and kids club entertainment what you might get at other properties. So if that's what you are looking for - go somewhere else. We, the parents and our three kids age 2,5,7 didn't miss a thing and we will definitely stay again at the Trump! 
OK - one thing my kids were missing, was Disney channel. They just offer it as pay TV and I didn't want to pay 4 dollar for 20 minutes Good Luck Charlie... :)) But honestly the kids survived the four nights even without their favorite TV show pretty well!","Date of stay: February 2012","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We are seniors on a fixed income but I wanted our trip to be special and liked the good reviews I read.  Every positive thing I read about Trump is true.  The staff is excellent and friendly.  We received a free upgrade to a room with a beautiful ocean view on the 18th floor.  The bed was very comfortable as the were the sheets.  A complimentary bottle of sparkling wine was delivered to our room in honor of our anniversary.  Our room was cleaned twice a day and the turn-down service was fast, efficient and not intrusive at all.  The open shower in the good-size bathroom is excellent.    Put a bathmat down if you are worried about water on the marble floor!  Best towels and robes ever.  The kitchen area had every imaginable appliance including blender. The beach bag with fruit/water is a nice touch to take to the beach which is absolutely a short walk across the street. Quite frankly to keep our costs to a minimum we used the excellent city bus to go everywhere for a buck (senior rate)  – even to and from the airport (we did not arrive at The Trump in a cab let alone a limo).  We purchased our staples at Wal-Mart which has amazing prices for Honolulu.  While we did not eat at the Trump restaurants they do have happy hour with reasonably priced beer and wine and appetizers.    We wish we would have tried their famous Mai Tais but we are not really drinkers.  It was so quiet there. The swimming pool is fine – long and good for cooling off. There’s an ocean out there folks! We loved the area and the upscale shops.  It is not as crowded as right in the heart of Waikiki and you can easily walk everywhere.  Plus you are also across from Ft. DeRussy a very very nice park.   I would recommend this hotel even for the budget conscious!  For those with lots of discretionary income it is a must.  For those on a fixed income there are other ways to cut back on expenses!

This is emphasized by the streets on either sided that are noisy with commercial vehicles supplying other beachside properties. Pool is very small and not much larger than a lap pool.

The room also included a small kitchenette, which was nice, and a beautiful bathroom. The people working at the hotel were unfailingly pleasant and helpful, and were good at anticipating our needs.

The rooms with one or more bedrooms had in-room washers and dryers. The studios did not, and there was no washer and dryer available in the hotel. The cost of sending one item of clothing to be laundered was exhorbitant. While I loved the hotel in general, I think the lack of available laundry facilities for studios was a big mistake in the planning of this hotel, and will keep me from staying here again.","Date of stay: February 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

This was our first stay at the hotel, and we will definitely be back again.  The service is indeed 5 stars, and the room was gorgeous.  The room we selected was the deluxe partial ocean view studio.  We booked on Expedia, and had zero problems when we arrived.  The staff was friendly, gave us the overview of the hotel and welcomed us with sincerity.  Our room was on the 18th floor, and it was perfect size for 2 adults.  We had a lanai, that was furnished with a table and two chairs. We spent several evenings having a drink overlooking our partial ocean view.  We liked the idea of finding local places to eat, and this location is perfect for exploring.  You are directly across the street from a fantastic beach, and the hotel will arrange to have a beach bag and chairs ready for you when you want to spend the day enjoying the sunshine.  The cost was nominal and we thought it was entirely worth the expense for the chairs and umbrella. The staff will check on you during the day to see if you need anything.  Excellent service all the way around.  The concierge staff at the Trump Waikiki is truly the best.  They will help you with reservations, offer lot's of local tips on where to dine or visit, and were so gracious with their hospitality and kindness.

After speaking with them on the phone I was unsure of staying here because it was not on the beach.  They told me that the beach was a short 5-10 minute walk.  Hmmm???
Well, they should of said the beach was across the street!  We arrived on Friday night and the location, the views, the welcoming staff were fantastic!  It doesn't matter whether you're in the penthouse suite or a standard room.  This Trump crew treats all their guests like a VIP!

We choose the 2 bedroom suite with a den.  This is perfect for the whole family.  It even has 3 full baths and a full deluxe kitchen.  We called ahead of time and they stocked the fridge with our requests.  One of the kids got sick and they had medicine delivered within the hour.  The service is what I recommend most about the hotel.

The quality of the furnishings was very new and modern.  We liked the fact that the pool is small and NOT designed for kids - if you are looking for a typical Hawaiian resort pool experience - do not stay here.  If you want a quiet pool with very attentive pool service and great food and drink offerings, this is your place.

We were incredibly impressed with the breakfast buffet with a remarkable variety of both Western and Japanese items.  Their other restaurants were also very good with interesting selections of Asian, Hawaiian and more continental choices of food, cocktails, and non-alcoholic drinks.

They are exceptional.

They do all the little things right, all the time. Smiles in the hall, friendly greetings to our 2.5 year old, always taking the time to shake his hand, give him a high five, or let him investigate whatever tool or piece of equipment they happened to have in their hands.

And this includes everyone from the guy who opened the door of our taxi from the airport, to the concierge to the front desk, right through to the housekeeping and maintenance staff.

The rooms are spacious, clean, and comfortable equipped with high quality Wolf and Sub-Zero appliances and a full selection of kitchen tools and small appliances, flatware and dinnerware.

We used their shopping service to stock our suite with a selection of foods for our two children - squishy fruit, baby food, etc - al the little things that are comforting to kids after a long journey.

We also utilized the extremely skilled and knowledgeable concierge and e-Attaché service for everything from dinner reservations, rental cars, taxis to arranging activities for our kids at local attractions, and plotting routes for me to ride my bicycle around the island.

Without a doubt this is our hotel of choice in Waikiki. For business, couples or a family getaway Trump understand and execute all of the things required to create a positive experience and lasting impression.

None of them are time-shares, so you'll be in a condo that's always rented as a hotel room.  You will not see any difference in what you find at any top-end hotel.  

Everyone working at this hotel seems to have been infused with ""Aloha.""  Every employee we interacted with was quietly efficient, courteous and helpful, and made us feel welcome.  As soon as you pull up to the door the valet has your door open and a bellman is standing by the trunk waiting to take your luggage.  And, while $30 a day to park your car may seem like a lot, it isn't in Waikiki; the outdoor lot across the street is $36 a day.  And it's great to pull up to the front and leave your car with the valet, and when I called down to have my car brought up it was usually there before we got down to the lobby.

The room is immaculate, well-designed, and the furnishings are lovely in a modern, understated way.  The bathroom is large and elegant, and there is a complete kitchen with high-end appliances.  We stayed for six days, so we did make some use of the kitchen, and we enjoyed sitting on our balcony having coffee in the morning and wine in the evening.  Spend the extra money and take a room on the ocean view side (although our room did not face the ocean directly).  Those rooms face over Ft. Debussy (and some ocean), so there are no high-rises to block the view.  And, you're at the very end of Waikiki, facing away from it, but a short walk puts you right in the middle of it.  The room was very, very quiet; we very rarely heard any noise at all.

Everything about this hotel is wonderful and no detail was so small that it had not already been anticipated and addressed.  I will certainly stay there again when I'm in Honolulu.  The only negative note is that the ""swimming pool"" is not much more than a lap-pool, but we didn't care about that.  By the way, don't pay the hotel rate, find a discount on the internet.  I think we paid about $100 less than the hotel rate per night.","Date of stay: February 2012","Trip type: Traveled on business","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We usually stay on the beach and closer to Duke's - which for us, is the center of Waikiki.... however I have to say we were very pleased with our new vacation location and really got to explore the newer shopping area & restaurants around the Trump - which I\we loved!

I'd also like to just state that it's worth going to the Trump just to have their signature Mai Tai - it is AMAZING!!!!!!  I still think about it and can't wait to return for another on later this year (hopefully!)

The hotel is certainly 5 star.  The staff are wonderful.  We had a couple of problems during our stay - there was a mix up with our room when we arrived however it was sorted out as quickly as possible which we really appreciated after the long trip there.  Also after checking out on our last day - I realised I'd left my diamond necklace in our hotel room - we returned to the hotel later that day and it was returned to me.. the cleaning staff had turned it in which I was just so grateful for! 

Even thought the hotel isn't on the beach, it is directly accessible by the beach access path that is directly in front of the hotel so you can quickly make your way to the beach and the stroll along the path down to the rest of town is lovely.

Another feature of the hotel we were fortunate enough to try out was the spa.  We made an appointment for a couples massage during our stay and both my husband and I agreed that it was the BEST massage we'd EVER had!!!  It was certainly more than what we would normally spend on something like that on a weekend away - however we both agreed that we were so glad that we did.

I'd certainly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a special place to stay in Waikiki.","Date of stay: November 2011","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Our trip to Hawaii was one to help her recover and relax.  We arrived In Honolulu at 1 PM on February 3rd and she was completely exhausted from our travel.  We were sharing a condo at the Wyndham with some friends and when we tried to check in, they informed us we could not due to our names were not on the guest list to be checked in.  I explained our situation (and even showed them the text messages from our friends - I also gave them my ID and Credit Card) but they simply said they could not let us into our room until our friends arrived.  We had another 4 hours before our friends plane got in!  They then told us that they may have a temporary guest room available but it would be another 2 hours before it would be ready.  They also said that if someone else wanted to come in and use it, we would have to vacate it for the guests.  I was desperate as my wife had to have a place to lay down.  

We made our way accoss the street to a park bench and I had my wife lay down.  About 5 minutes later, a security officer told us we had to leave.  I explain the situation that my wife desperately needed a place to rest.  He was sympathetic but told us that we had to leave.

We made our way to the beach and my wife simply could not go another step.  I found a stack of lounge chairs and a small strip of shade provided by the trunk of a palm tree.  Melvino and Simon came up to me and I feared the inevitable.  I explained to Melvino that we were not hotel guests but my wife was in desperate need to lay down.  I braced myself for what was coming.  But Melvino simply said, ""I understand your situation, please let me help you.  I would like to provide a place for your wife to be more comfortable and get the rest that she needs.""  He took us to an area with a huge umbrella and a padded cushioned lounge chair and said, ""She can rest here as long as she needs to."" 

My heart is filled with gratitude for the kindness and generosity that he showed us.  We were not hotel guests but he gave us the best Aloha ever.

I enjoyed staying there, nevertheless it does come across as a somewhat soulless city hotel. 
I mean, we could be literally anywhere in the world, and allthough just about everything hits the mark, there's not really anything to write home about really.

Wow factor: the heated plunge pool with views of the ocean and Honolulu, great for sunset. 
The negatives: Housekeeping can be a bit intrusive, never forget the sign on the door if you want privacy.
I would have enjoyed a seperate shower in the bathroom, especially since the tub is so deep, but that's about it. 
I did have a minor incident with a knife at breakfast, wich was properly adressed by the staff, who took care of the bill.

We experienced the same friendliness and helpful service that we received a year ago.  Often you will go to a hotel that once the newness wears off, service and standards begin to slip, but this is not so with the Trump Hotel Waikiki.

All staff that we encountered were as professional, friendly and courteous as the first time.  We particularly liked the service from the Concierge who made a recommendation to an alternate restaurant when the one we had chosen was unavailable.  This new restaurant was a great alternative and will be added to our list of restaurants we visit upon our return.   

I do agree with other reviewers that the pool is quite small and you need to ensure that you get there early enough to get a chair in the sun.  As we were there at a peak time, it can get very crowded for such a small space.  It is a shame that they didn’t build a larger pool but the beach is just across the road, so if you find it really annoying you can go to the beach.  You are in beautiful Hawaii with wonderful beaches, so the pool isn’t that important really.

We had an issue with the refrigerator in our room during our stay, and someone was up promptly to check it.  As we had a few things stored in the fridge and were concerned about them spoiling, we were given a temporary refrigerator until it could be fixed.

We also like the turndown service so that your towels are replaced in the evening and having a bottle of water placed by your bedside is a nice touch.   We received complimentary macaroons on the first night of our stay which we hadn’t received on our last stay so that was a nice surprise.

We really like that even though it is a large hotel, you don’t feel like you are in a busy hotel.  Even over the peak Christmas/New Year period, it didn’t feel crowded.  It is very quiet in your room and the hotel is incredibly relaxing.  There is no other place to stay in Waikiki in our opinion.","Date of stay: January 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

For one the infinity pool is tiny - let's call it a balcony with water.  The hotel is not beachside - you need to walk a bit to get there (not a big deal but I do miss having hotel side facilities on the beach) and I knew that when booking.

On the plus side the hotel gives out complimentary water on request, gives out a beach kit (with fruit and towels etc.) a nice touch and the staff were more than friendly.

The rooms are of course clean and up to a standard of a 5 star with free wifi throughout (always a plus).

On my booking request I asked for a room high up and they kindly gave me a partial ocean view for no extra charge which was a nice touch.  

Now onto my gripe; on leaving they offered me late checkout and I stupidly asked if there was an extra charge for it and of course there is not - the person on the phone then backtracked when I showed I was keen on a late checkout (7pm) and asked me to call the frontdesk the day I was too leave to confirm (he said he would 'strongly' request for a late checkout for me)... sure enough when I called to confirm next day I'm sure they pretended to tap on the computer and quickly said that my room was already taken and I had to checkout the usual 12pm (no flexibility not even by a few more hours)....so not happy about that...would of preferred if they had not offered it in the first place rather than play games.

If I were to return to Waikiki I doubt I would use the Trump again - not because I had a bad experience - because I had a good experience but the Trump just doesn't quite give me everything I require when it comes to luxury beach hotels.","Date of stay: January 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

The staff provided exceptional service and were very friendly. The facilities were modern and high end. The property was situated near the heart of the Waikiki Beach activities. Nice touches included the welcome tray of sweets.

The rooms, including the least expensive, were very well appointed and large and being a time share, there is a well equipped galley kitchen with full cooking utensils, large under counter refrigerator, microwave, 2 burner cooktop with exhaust fan. 

The building is situated perpendicularly to Waikiki beach so all rooms have an angled glimpse of a view of the ocean from the balcony. the first 6 floors is a parking structure so guest rooms start on the 7th floor.

There is a large onsite restaurant open for breakfast and dinner.

One disappointment is this property is NOT situated on the beach. It is across the street and there is a high rise hotel in the way that obstructs most of the beach view.

The reason I can not rate this as a five start hotel are:
1. The public areas and lobbies are small and there is no quiet public sitting  areas.
2. The pool is very small and easily taken over by 3 children. The full time pool attendant that lays out the chairs and provides cold water was an elegant touch.
3. there is no garden space or green ares on the property.

The extra $30 per day for parking was an annoyance, unfortunately this seems to be standard practice for all hotels in Waikiki.

Overall we would consider staying at the Trump again but would likely opt for a property near the lagoon adjacent to the marina as this is the best portion of the beach and not as crowded.","Date of stay: January 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

We made our reservations through Jet Luxury and were upgraded to a beautiful 1 bedroom suite. The suite had every imaginable convenience - even a wine cooler, dishwasher, full sides refrigerator. The bed was great, and the service was impeccable. We paid $219 and consider that a really great value. 

Although the hotel is not on the beach, it is only one block away, and the hotel provided us with a beach bag with towels, suntan lotion, water and even fruit. Service was impeccable. They also have a deal with a provider on the beach who rents you chairs and an umbrella fro $30 for a half day... very convenient and reasonable.

The one downside of the hotel is the pool and pool deck. The pool is a tiny, narrow one lane affair and the Jacuzzi is tiny. What was really bad was the odor from the kitchen that seemed to be vented over the pool. It was so bad, we finally had to leave the pool area.

So, unless you are set on sitting around a large pool or having a hotel right on the beach, this is a terrific value with a wonderful staff and first rate service.","Date of stay: January 2012","Trip type: Traveled on business","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Everything was as good as it is always other than the checking in service this time. We arrived around 10:30 am after 7 hours flying. We were exhausted as you can imagine. However, we end up getting into our room after more than three hours waiting! Initially, the guy told me that he is asking for the status of our room and asked us to have a seat aside. After more than half an hour without being told anything, I asked him what happened and he said the room was not ready yet. We then decided to take a walk. But when we came back more than half an hour, they then said the room would not be ready before 1 pm. We were depressed and decided to go for lunch and preyed we would get in when we came back. However, the room was still not ready after we finished our lunch around 1 pm. They then said the room may be ready around 3 pm although we end up getting our room sometimes after 2 pm. If this experience did not sound too much for you, the worst part is that the reception simply did not tell us what happend and did not apology for the delay.  

Now a little advise for those flying a long time and need rest as soon as possible. You might want to put a swimming wear in your carry on bag. If it happens you have to wait for a long time, you could put it on in the wash room on the reception floor and slip into the spa pool for a few minutes before going for sound sleep on the pool side beach chairs!","Date of stay: January 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Superb (even better) experience again.","My mother and I stayed at this property in December 2011. We first stayed at Trump Waikiki in 2010, and we truly enjoyed the experience. This time, we enjoyed our stay again - even more than last time. 

Upon our arrival, the first word we heard was ""Welcome back"" with the welcome (back?) lei. I could expect the front desk staff know this, but I did not expect this from the Bell man! The front desk staff also welcomed us again. They are friendly but at the same time they are courteous without overdoing it. What surprised us was that the person who delivered the suitcases to our room also remembered us. Their hospitality looked very genuine (even though it might be a result of the good training!)  

I might have already said this in the previous review but yes, the swimming pool is relatively small, so if you are expecting a pool for young kids, probably this is not the best pick. However, for frequent visitors to Hawaii or those who want to enjoy the private feeling, the pool serves it purpose. I like how it is away from the noise and crowd. Perfect place to relax, read, and enjoy a few glasses of cool drink. 

The service at the restaurants are good as well but the selections are relatively limited at this hotel. But you are in Honolulu - walk a few blocks, and try different restaurants. The place we always come back to is ""Matsugen"" which is a soba (buckwheat noodle restaurant) and ""Suntory,"" which is a Japanese restaurant. Both of them are very authentic (trust me because I am from Japan). 

Hey, don't miss the cookies, pastries, and coffee/other warm beverage in the lobby (where the check-in desk is) in the afternoon. They are so good! And like other reviewers have said, take advantage of beach bags with goodies when you go out to get soaked in the sun.","Date of stay: December 2011","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

BUT we were most disappointed and felt cheap with their “nickel and dime” policies when they asked for a measly $3 to have bellman deliver a gift package to our room.  To make matters worse, they were seeking $3 not from us, the registered guests, but from a friend who was delivering a gift.  The bellman would normally receive a tip anyway so it is insulting and in very poor taste when a supposedly “high end” hotel would impose such a “chicken s___” policy.  We have stayed at the Kahala, the Sheraton Waikiki, the Hilton, and the Halekulani in past vacations and never have we felt this type of low class, nickeling and diming policy, which turns off high end visitors.  Sorry for this negative comment but the hotel rates are high enough, without trying to pick up a few extra pennies here and there with this type of irritating policy.  And what hurts and infuriated us is that they pulled it on two separate occasions.  The first when friends tried to send up a gift parcel, when the hotel security would not permit them to go above the 6th floor for a personal delivery.  The second when a delivery service tried to deliver a bottle of cough medicine for my daughter.  So, Trump, please wake up before it is too late, as negative news travels quickly.  We were excited and anticipated a classy and first class facility with the Trump name and reputation but our dreams were for naught.  We even voiced our concerns to the Bell Desk Manager, a Ms. Kawai Yamashiro, but she only became defensive and tried to justify the practice by indicating that the bellmen receive very low pay, and that all the major hotels impose this charge for delivery to the rooms – NOT TRUE.  And the excuse about low wages for Bellmen is also in poor taste.  After al, this is a TRUMP project, so you would expect that staff is better trained and should be paid more than the common hotels.  These small things do add up – especially when you start nickeling and diming your guests.  This is very similar to the Bank of America charge of $5 for a monthly debt card use fee, which was rescinded due to consumer outrage.  And it is also similar to the case of the Verizon billing practices, which were recently rescinded due to numerous customer complaints and potential for a class action lawsuit.  So, come on Trump – wise up – is it worth it for a few measly bucks to cheapen your image?  Shame shame on you – be a man.
On a minor note, our shower did not have a ledge or soap dish facility so we had to stoop to the floor to get our soap and shampoo supplies.","Date of stay: December 2011","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

From the superb Parking Valet's to front desk to house cleaning..all genuinely welcoming and caring. The property is newish, so everything has that new (and modern) shine to it.

Also, when you go to the beach, I found the beach to be a bit nicer walking to the left, down by the Westin Moana. There is also a Starbucks right across the street from Trump, with outdoor seating. Good for a quick breakfast and coffee. Excellent breakfast at Eggs N Things, which is also, right down the block.

I decided to get the 3 bedroom suite (room 2409) this time since they are located on the higher floors (24th floor and up). Last year, we were in a 2 bedroom (room 1219) which has a great corner view of the ocean above Fort DeRussy, but I can't describe the amazing view from the 3 bedroom suites -- just beautiful ocean from almost every window. Since the 24th floor is higher than most of the surrounding hotel (exception is the Sheraton Waikiki) it offers a spectacular panoramic view.

Also used the Trump Attaché service to have ice cream with cones and bottles of water restocked in the refrigerator. They delivered complimentary macadamia nuts 3-ways (chocolate covered, honey-roasted, and in the shell with a mac nut cracker; also received chocolate dipped strawberries the same day as well.

Recommend the breakfast buffet on the 6th floor In-Yo cafe -- go early and enjoy the peace and quiet. Also recommend the Wai' Olu lounge on the 6th floor -- reserve one of the sofa lounge areas during the sunset; again a beautiful view.","Date of stay: December 2011","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Great Service.  Thanks so much!","I would like to say that I agree with all the previous positive reviews for Trump International Waikiki, especially the reviews on great services.  All the staff I encountered during our stay were genuinely helpful.  They really cared about our needs. 

We really liked the beach bags filled with chilled water, sunblock and fruits.  Beach was only 2 minutes away, just across the street.  It's not a problem for us at all.  It's a quieter part of Waikiki so it was pleasant for us.  

One staff in particular we want to thank was JULIA.  She went out of her way to help us find the stuffy which was left behind in the hotel room by our son.  We called the hotel after checkout and housekeeping said they didn't find anything.  We then passed by the hotel before our departure and see if the stuffy had turned up.  Then I was lucky enough to be helped by Julia.  She went in and out to ask all department and after 15 minutes, she has found the stuffy.  That saved my son's day.  That was his favourite stuffy.  Thanks to you, Julia, my son had a very pleasant and memorable vacation in Honolulu.  :)

Overall, I would recommend this hotel to anyone.  This is not just a business hotel.  Children feel very much welcome at the hotel.  My kids were given two seal toys, coloring books, crayons, juice and cookies upon arrival.  They said they want to visit Waikiki and stay at the Trump again.

Thank you for a great vacation!","Date of stay: December 2011","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

From a scale perspective, the Trump is not one of those large resorts you can find in Waikiki like the Hilton or the Sheraton.  Instead, it's a luxury hotel that has a couple of restaurants / bars and that's it.  If you prefer that kind of scale, you will like this place.  

The most noticeable aspect of the Trump is the service, which is top notch.  It reflects an attention to detail that you will see as you walk around the place.  Everyone - I mean everyone - who works here is friendly and greets you with a smile and an ""Aloha"".  Concierges on the ground floor are friendly and helpful. The hotel is across the street from Fort DeRussy Beach Park, a two minute walk away.  We stayed in a ""20"" room, which was a studio room with a city view and partial ocean view.  The room has a modern marble kitchen, spacious bathroom and very comfortable king size bed with a nice, soft mattress cover that makes you want to lie in bed for hours.  There's also a sofa and coffee table.  The room was very clean, bigger than we expected (probably around 450 square feet), and looked brand new.  We liked the layout of the room, because when you enter it you're in the kitchen area, which sort of acts as a foyer that provides around 15 feet of privacy and separation between the front door and the living room area.  You actually can't see the bed from the front door.

The ceilings were lower than I expected.  When I used the treadmill in the gym, I was afraid of hitting my head on the ceiling (I didn't, and I'm 6'2"").

A few suggestions about staying here:

1. Hang out by the infinity pool and read a book.  You can order drinks there, and they turn on the lights when it gets dark if you want to keep reading.

2. You can tell the housekeeping staff what time you want them to clean your room.

3. You can choose your pillows.  Ask at the check-in desk.

4. The gym is smallish but not bad, especially if you use the treadmill or elliptical.  They also offer free headphones in case you forget yours.

5. Ask the concierge for a beach kit, which includes towels, sunscreen, fruit and a bottle of water.","Date of stay: December 2011","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Our studio ocean view room was spectacular, the bed amazingly comfortable, the kitchen well-equipped and finally the service impeccable (i.e. the full kitchen allowed us to take advantage of stocking our fridge with fresh fruit from the many ABC stores a short walk away along with some baked goods we purchased at locally recommended bakeries).

Although not directly located ""on the beach"", the concierge has ""beach tote bags"" at the ready with towels, chilled water and fresh fruit (apple, orange) packed and ready to go (be sure and call ahead to make sure they have enough and are ready for pick-up).  The walk to the beach is at most 5 minutes away down a paved level walkway (the pool is nice although somewhat small as other reviews have already referenced).

We had a rental car and found the location provided quick access in and out of the Waikiki area without having to drive down busy (i.e. frequently congested) Kalakaua Avenue.

Service was very gracious, prompt and professional even during busy periods of check-in/out of literally busloads of groups.

I believe the highest recommendation is ""we would stay there again.""","Date of stay: November 2011","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We got all of that at Trump International.  The staff was very helpful from directions to get places, to extending our stay by a day, and bringing extra towels and blankets when requested.  We had a problem with our refrigerator making noise on the second night and called the front desk.  They had another fridge brought up and disconnected the old one until they got a service person in the following morning.  The response was immediate and the solution was great!

It's not on the beach and the resort amenities aren't the greatest.  For example, the pool is a small infinity pool.  But if you're looking for a luxury hotel that places service above all else, then you will be very satisfied.  With hotels at this level, the devil is in the details.  It's the extra bottle of water, the ""aloha"" greeting by EVERY member of their staff,  and the efforts to make sure you are taken care of.  Another perk is having a full kitchen.  It makes eating the fresh pineapple that much easier.

I stay in hotel's for work (and for pleasure travel) at least 40 nights a year and this was a stand out. Possibly the best hotel I've stayed at with a family of 5, ever. This includes Ritz, Four Seasons, etc. etc.

There are many restaurants and high end shopping within walking distance. Hotel has a warm welcome with lei's and cold towels upon arrival. Big Friday night fireworks show - don't miss it from the lobby. Service was really great from everyone at the hotel. My husband and I took this trip by ourselves, and it was a really nice hotel for couples. The pool was smaller, but we didn't mind - there are nice chairs and towels with sunscreen available, as well as drink and food service. The fitness center wasn't enough if you are really into working out. They did have very nice cardio equipment, but no free weights/machines. However - my husband and I bought a weeks pass at a 24 hour fitness (a short 15 min walk away) and enjoyed working out there instead. They had plenty of everything you need to get a good work out. We did have one problem during our stay...between the 2nd and 3rd day of our stay, My bottle perfume was ""missing"" from our room. I reported this at checkout. They told me they would pass it on to security, but I seriously doubt they did. I never had anyone follow up with us after. I expected them to at least contact me with a response. I figured at this type of hotel we wouldn't have to worry about things being lifted from our room. Other than this disappointment, we loved the hotel and the location. They brought welcome gifts during our stay also. Valet and elevators were prompt during our entire stay. Very close to a huge mall and the Waikiki shopping district. If you are a health/fitness nut - make sure to climb Koko Head, which is much more challanging than Diamond Head. The views are worth the effort! Also take a drive to the North Shore for surf watching. You can check the surf report to find out when the waves will be the highest.","Date of stay: December 2011","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Absolutely awesome.   It is not the largest hotel, but the service is absolutely the best. It is fairly new so everything looks good.  The pool area is smaller but you get a great view of the ocean and sunset from one end.   

That is the only bad thing, now get ready for the good

 Service, service, service. 
1.   These guys clean your room twice day.  It's like being on a cruise. I was shocked. You to the beach. Come back to shower and change, go out and when you come home, it's like brand new again...just wonderful..
2.  .then they have travel bags downstairs you can grab to take shopping or to the beach and they give you free sunscreen bottles, free bottled water, and free towels...they even pack you an apple and orange as a snack...if you want bring your own bag and ask them for whatever you want...their pool even has free sunscreen...which is absolutely awesome for hawaii weather...that saves tons of money and makes you feel like a VIP
3.  They gave us a room on a higher floor when we asked if it was possible...then the fridge broke so they gave us a portable one which was nice, but the best was yet to come...the nite manager apologized for the inconvenience and since we only had one night left, he wanted to make sure we left on a positive note, so he upgraded us to a 2 bedroom suite...OMG...this place was almost as big as a house...the kitchen was a full kitchen, looks better than my house...and the view was absolutely breath taking with a balcony  We definitely left on a positive note.  That was a rare experience since I'm not willing to drop $800-$1000 per night on a room(I looked it up)
4) I was in such a rush to leave that I didn't check my bill properly and missed that they accidentally charged me 2 days of parking instead of one.  I called them toll free, and explained and in 2 minutes they looked it up, appologized and refunded my money...no hassle at all..even sent an email confirmation of the refund

5) free wifi everywhere. 

So everyone, this is an awesome place and I'm a picky guy, but thank you so much to Doug in the daytime desk, and Ryan the night manager...I'm planning my return already

I'm very glad we stayed here as it was the nicest hotel in our 2 week holiday.  We had just stayed at the Trump in Las Vegas the week prior, so it was good to compare both hotels (I will write another review them soon!)
 
We booked our accommodation using www.otel.com about 4 months prior and booked a Deluxe Ocean View Studio. My parents booked their accommodation only 3 weeks prior and paid $800 more that we did for a Superior Ocean View Studio (through www.zuji.com.au), which was a significantly smaller room, so be aware the Deluxe Vs Superior rooms are different.  My parents loved their room in any case, but we were glad we booked a bit earlier, getting a cheaper price and a HUGE room.

In our room, we got two double beds (instead of a queen bed) which ended up being great as our room felt much bigger having the extra bed.  The room quality (lounge, tv, bed linen, towels, pillows etc) was excellent, and we had lovely views (even though we were on the 12th floor, the sunset was spectacular!) and having a full kitchen to make breakfast/snacks in every day made a big difference.  We didnt end up paying any Resort Fee's either. The only downside was, our toilet kept getting blocked (every day for 5 days straight), so it was a bit annoying, but not overly so as housekeeping were literally there within 10 minutes to fix it and we were always heading out the door so it really didnt bother us.  They do a full housekeeping service twice a day, once in the morning to change bed linen/towels and when we came back from dinner each night, they had done a turn-down service as well, and replaced any wet towels in the bathroom.  We loved having our room so clean and fresh all the time.

We hired a car for the week (which we highly recommend) and the valet staff were fantastic, always offering us directions and bottles of water.  The concierge also gave us day bags with fresh towels, water, pieces of fruit and sunscreen – this was a big plus for a few day trips we did.

We swam in the pool about 4 times during our stay (some days were a bit overcast/cool - hey it was winter!), but be aware that most of the lounge beds were full by the lunch/afternoon crowd.  If you’re there early enough in the mornings (say around 7-8am), the pool area was almost empty, so we stuck  to morning swims.  

We ate at BLT which I would only give a 5/10 as we all found ours steaks REALLY SALTY but the service was excellent and we enjoyed their Popover Bread rolls, they were great!

I would definitely stay in the Trump again – for the extra $500 we paid to stay at Trump compared to perhaps staying at other hotels/resorts I looked at on Tripadvisor, we certainly felt we got value for the extra money.

My Top 3 dinning suggestions close by:
1) Taormina Sicilian Restaurant (227 Lewers St) about 8-10 min walk from Trump (we ate here twice)
2) The Beachhouse (inside the Moana Surfrider hotel)  about 15-20 min walk from Trump (make a booking!!)
3) Eggs N Things (343 Saratoga Road ) only 2 min walk from Trump (breakfast was the best, but be prepared to wait 30-45 mins for a table, at ANY time during the day, they are flat out)","Date of stay: November 2011","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I've stayed in many hotels around the world and I can categorically state that Trump has friendliest, most knowledgeable staff. Everything from personalised welcome messages on the phone, to little gifts most evenings. Lisa is a standout at concierge and Dean at the Belldesk was exceptional. We left the hotel whilst the Honolulu marathon was running. The street in front of the hotel was blocked, so Dean drove us, and walked our bags across the marathon route, and escorted us to a pre-booked taxi. I've never experienced service like that.

It was simply the most magnificent hotel we have ever experienced!
When we arrived we were greeted with shell leis and personal escort to the main lobby for a quick and efficient check in. On arrival at our room, which was a deluxe ocean view studio, we were treated to a gift of chilled Prosecco and a welcoming note about our stay. The room had two queen beds, a sleeper sofa, an amazing bathroom with open shower, tub, and twin vanities, and a fully stocked kitchen. The view from the room was combined ocean and city, with the room facing Fort DeRussy Park. The view was absolutely magnificent and lends itself to spectacular sunset watching and a front row seat for the fireworks on Friday nights. We were on the 19th floor and this level was nice to lessen some of the traffic noise when the sliding window was open. Speaking of the lanai, it was a great size for us, and we spent our mornings with coffee there each day. We left the door open nearly all the time when we were in the room, and if there was too much noise, the sliding door completely eliminated it.
In our opinion, the location of this hotel is perfect because it sits adjacent to Fort DeRussy, is off the beach a little bit, and is on the Beach Walk. Being adjacent to Fort DeRussy allows for the wonderful ocean, park, and city views. Being one row back from the beach insulates you from the hustle and bustle of the beach, but keeps you close enough to walk to the beach in just a couple of minutes. Lastly, being on the Beach Walk gives you quick and easy access to restaurants, shopping, and people-watching, and that ended up being a nightly ritual for us!
The hotel facility outside the room itself is also wonderful. When we first experienced the lobby and café level on the 6th floor, we really felt like the view was a photograph, it was so pleasing. The openness of the building really accentuates the tropical feel. We enjoyed some pool time one day when it was really windy, and found that the pool area is a good break against the wind and gives you the option of sun or shade. While we didn’t actually use the pool, it looked very inviting. As mentioned in other reviews, it is NOT designed for children to spend the day there. It is perfect for adult exercise in the morning and transitions to relaxing sunset watching with a cocktail in the evening!
The Staff: Every single person on the staff of this hotel was superb. Their desire to make your stay memorable and perfect was evident in every interaction. One of the most outstanding staff members was Dean, the valet captain. He was particularly helpful and friendly, and we stayed and talked with him for more than a few minutes each day. He was always interested in what our plans were for the day and had great advice as a local to our travels. Dean is a true ambassador for both the hotel and Hawaii! Another outstanding member of the staff was Keile (spelling?) who helped us in the In-Yo’ Café. She was extremely helpful, friendly, and welcoming.  These two are just a sample of the staff and every one of them deserves the biggest thanks for the atmosphere they create!
For all the negative reviewers, we just don’t agree. Everything we have ever read that was negative is either information you can obtain while researching the hotel or we simply didn’t experience. The rooms are spacious and open. We didn’t experience any issues with the open shower. We knew about the pool and its focus toward adults, which is what we wanted. It isn’t too far from the beach. The staff was outstanding and not intrusive or fake. The valet parking is a known charge from the website and is an outstanding service. If you don’t want it, park across the street at the Hale Koa open lot for a fee.
All in all, this hotel is even more than we anticipated. The high level of service and the wonderful facility will spoil every other hotel we ever visit! We are already planning a trip back next year, and there will be no discussion on where we stay!","Date of stay: November 2011","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Everything about the hotel is first class and quality. This hotel is a bargin  for the price to stay here. We booked a stay for 4N and paid  3N in a Partial ocean view Suite and couldn't be happier. We had corner unit, nice view of the sea, nice view of the city and high enough for the double glazed windows to block out all noise. The entire kitchen  was all high end appliances, it was just  wonderful and we felt spoiled. The kitchen  was fully stocked with glasses, cups, knives forks, toaster,  etc etc. The fridge is empty so you can stock it yourself or follow the instruction on the card left in it and it will get filled for you (at a cost - not for free).

A lot of the other reviews have covered everything and I second all the favourable reviews. I couldn't find one fault the hotel as a guest. This hotel is the best in all of  Oahu, Honolulu, Waikiki!!!!!!!!

The staff make the Trump such a great place to stay as well as the comfort level, bed, bathroom (television channels?), system of cards (son lost one and no issue about a new one(and no charge either). Staff on concierge desk give a super assist with dennis leading the way......dont lose him! All levels of assistance for anything... brilliant; beach bags for the day with towel, fruit, sunscreen, water, water available cold from concierge desk. Breakfast buffet was brilliant and great choices........japanese included of course! Pool area was great, service/staff associated great.... lap pool (4 feet deep) and spa (yes hot) worked well. Area for sunning yourself (in between light rain showers a cloud cover) was adequate. The bed...now someone knows whats good! AND a choice of four different pillows (goose down sir??). This bed just melts around your body!
Turn the bed down for you at night? very nice mini macaroons on first night arrival. Staff dont get in lifts with you, windows get cleaned, new towels when bed is tuirned dow, staff washup your cups saucer, pan... fully stocked kitchen was great (corkscrew had an issue).
This was not cheap but we knew it and it was magnicficiant and worth the expense and wonderful time we had with our family. We had room 2020 and children 2010. I will be back and tripadviser is a must for all travellers and restaurants reviews etc. Gymnasium with infused water was great and I assume that the Spa on level 6 would have been eqaully brilliant (costing the norm for that sort of hot rock, aromatic thing).

from the start. I flew to Honolulu 2 days ahead of my partner who was on a business trip with a colleague in Orlando and we were all meeting up in Waikiki for some much needed R & R. I had read the Trip Advisor reviews before I left and was looking forward to making my own assessment of the hotel. I think the only think that it negative about this hotel is the fact that it isn't on the beach and it isn't really a negative but it would have just been the icing on the cake. I don't think this is a hotel for a family resort type vacation if that is what you are looking for, this is an adult hotel which suits me to a tee. I really loved it!!!!!! 

They have the right level of service without being intrusive and all hotels should aspire to be just like it. There is no screaming children to contend with and don't get me wrong I love kids but this place is not suited to children. Everyone is very attentive and polite and when dining in the restaurant the wait staff knew exactly what they were talking about regarding wines and the menu. The little touches and attention to detail were just lovely. 

I am getting married next year in Waikiki and was actually looking for a reception venue and unfortunately Trump doesn't have any banquet rooms or a room large enough to hold my wedding otherwise I would have booked it on the spot. I would stay here again and I have travelled to world and have alot of experience in staying in hotels and this one is an absolute gem.

The kitchen and facilities are fabulous. Every appliance and utensil you could ever need is there. It's huge in comparison to other rental apartment kitchens and far superior.

The main bedroom is big with ensuite and large walk-in closet. The bath - well in theory lovely and deep for a long soak, but pretty difficult for babies and small children. It is just too deep to put them in. I had to bathe with them daily because it was too hard to reach down and wash them properly. Shower in the main bathroom was a shower hose. It was pretty weak and time consuming to rinse out shampoo. The other showers in the guest bathroom and 2nd bedroom were much more powerful. Bathroom amenities were great, although not always replaced as needed.

Pool is located on the 6th floor. It's a pretty compact area and does not get all day sun at all. It has very few chairs in comparison to the amount of rooms in-house but the area is quite small.

Service very good. Position also great.

Highly recommend to families or those needing apartment facilities but wanting the service of a hotel.","Date of stay: November 2011","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

We booked the lowest cost room on a pay-for-three and get one free internet deal for a four-night stay.  Check-in was as smooth as can be at the 6th floor lobby.  The room, with ocean view, was lovely and there was no traffic noise from below as the very heavy double-glazed balcony door blocked sound very well.  The tiny kitchen was very well stocked with china, glasses and cooking materials, none of which we used, but the refrigerator easily accommodated our soft drinks and wine.  Turndown service each evening while we were out to dinner provided fresh towels.  We are not beach sitters, but for those who are, the hotel provides a lovely tote with towels as you go off.  We rented a car for a day and the concierge arranged a low cost rental with pickup at the hotel and delivery back to the hotel after we dropped off the car at the agency.  Trying to think of anything which could be done better, the only thing is that at the gym (nice machines) the water is dispensed in broad-rimmed cups rather than bottles, making it hard to drink without stopping.

It is opposite the fort derussy park and a 50m stroll to the beach.  When you go to the beach you are given a 'beach bag' containing sunscreen, water and towel.  The nice touch is the bag is a cooler bag so it will keep your drinks cool as well.

The hotel even provides a tote with chilled bottles of water, sun screen, and a  beach towel as well as a chair for the beach before you head across the road to the beach.  My view was great although I booked the lowest category room and the booking was at a special price.  You receive chilled flavored water upon arrival along with a cool wash cloth.  Goodies arriving to my room included a small plate of French cookies one day and a tropical flower in a vase the next.  Don't bother booking your own transportation back to the airport.  The hotel booked this for me at a lower price than I could have arranged and the shuttle was on time for the pick up.

We stayed in a very large 2 bdrm 2 bth corner suite on the 27th floor (room 2701). Not only was the room beautifully decorated and fully stocked in the kitchen but it was bigger than most apartments I have rented. I agree with other reviewers that there is not much of a Hawaiian feel in the hotel, it's a modern hotel that could reside in any big city. However, we didn't mind the contemporary feel.  I prefer modern furniture over wicker and floral curtains and bedspreads. As for location, it's not directly on the beach but neither are most hotels in Waikiki, plus it's only a small block away.

Pros - large room, floor to ceiling windows with ocean and city views, hotel customer service (free beach bags with towels, sunscreen, water, and fruit)

Cons - small hotel pool

Everyone on staff goes out of his/her way to make you feel special. Can't add anything to the sterling reviews posted here.
It's been 5-7 years since we last were in Waikiki. The western end now has high end stores that rival Rodeo Drive or Worth Avenue or 5th Avenue.This section of Kalalaua Avenue cleaned up beautifully.
Be sure to check out Lewers St, just two blocks from the Trump. Used to be seedy. Now, it's been transformed into a Beach Walkway concept, and it's waaaay cool ! Great shops and restraurants very close by.
Only issue we had - the mattress was too soft. We even got the staff to switch our original mattress with another one, but it made little difference.

Then we were offered iced water and cold towels. As our room wasn't ready yet they then gave us beach bags with fruit, water, towels and sunscreen. A while later they brought macaroons to the room to welcome us. A decent hotel will have the basics in place but an exceptional place like this one will go further and pay attention to details. The seemingly small things count for so much and mean a lot.

The service is magnificent, without being overbearing and the location is directly across from the beach so ideal. The beds are a bit soft for my liking but the rest of our party loved them. The dressing gowns are of the most immaculate quality. Best of all the 4th night was free as we'd booked three consecutive nights. I can't speak highly enough of this hotel.

I thought it'd be expensive, a bit garish, ostentatious, tacky. I couldn't have been more wrong. From the second we arrived I was in love and began writing this review in my head - although by now it'll probably come out a little more crudely. The Trump Waikiki is one of the most comfortable, high standard hotels I've ever stayed in. The property, rooms, facilities, services and service is all so ergonomically designed you keep saying to yourself - ""if I ran a hotel this is exactly how I'd want to do it"". 

The property itself is beautiful. It is so well designed and the styling reminded me of some of the Asian hotels I love - as did the service. Being greeted with a lei was a nice touch. Check-in was very, very smooth. Service throughout was what made this hotel exceptional. I love hotels in SE Asia because they get good service - the Trump reminded me of these. The staff are all so incredibly passionate about what they do and it shows. They all seem to be one step away from knowing your name without asking. 

The rooms were fantastic - comfortable, large, well-designed and ready for anything. The kitchen stands out at first - they're fully equipped with everything you could need. It was weird, but actually something I wish every hotel did! The bathroom was really good and had a huge, deep bath. The toiletries were very high quality too which was nice. I wish I'd stolen a dressing gown as it was the softest I've ever used. 

We were on a low floor and had a ""partial sea view"" but to be honest it didn't matter. I think all rooms have pretty great views no matter what they're of. Go to the pool area at sunset for some of the most beautiful ones you'll ever see. 

The bed was very comfortable and they had a pillow menu which you could use. I slept so incredibly well during my stay and the room was so peaceful. The huge TV was great and helped add to the modern feel of the place. The night time turn-down service was inpeccable and one of the things they do which makes the place stand out. 

The gym was small but contained all I needed - treadmills, free weights, bikes and two  weight machines. The Pocari Sweat and cucumber/lemon water dispensers were a great touch. 

The pool area was so good we spent most of every day there. It's in a great location to get sun all day and the loungers are very comfortable. The pool itself is really nice for a dip and you get great views from the whole area. Although relatively small, the area never filled up completely, and most people seemed to come for a while before heading off out, probably to the beach. I didn't bother with the beach once as the pool was so great. The pool staff really make the place so great though - they can't do enough to help. They brought around mini smoothies a couple of times too which was fantastic. They also provide free sunblock which, once again, is one of those touched which makes the Trump so special. The Mai Tai they serve claims to be the best out there - and I think it actually is.

The worst thing about the hotel was the elevators - they were rather slow. However, we did stay there during APEC and the Indonesian delegation were staying with us which caused the delays. 

Back to the staff once more - they are all amazing. The sense of pride they exude really makes this a special place to stay. 

I remember hearing Donald Trump once say something about his hotels delivering the service and amenities he's always wanted to be given when staying away from home. If this is the case then the man has got it right. I loved my time here and can't wait to go back - as well as check out some of the other Trump properties.","Date of stay: November 2011","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Says it all.","I'm hesitant to rate the hotel for what it deserves for the mere reason that it will probably be harder to get a reservation in the future, but it deserves to be said.
Let me start by saying that It was a long and hard road to arrival. We were kicked off our American Airlines flight and arrived almost 9hours later. We were tired and still angry, and looking to see what could possibly happen to us next.
Next!!!! An Outstanding Lei  Greeting by Valet(Even though our car was now a Ford Focus, due to arriving late and no cars left) Escorted to check-in and expeditiously swept off to our Beautiful 2 Bedroom Oceanfront Suite. WOW!!! Amazing. The room has elegantly appointed decor, furnishings and design. It's very spacious with a full kitchen, dining,living,and den areas. Two spacious elegant bathrooms to accommodate far more than just the two of us. This room has all the amenities you need to be pampered, including the Bosch washer and dryer. The views from the balcony and each window were breathtaking. We were on the 11th floor and barely heard outside activity even thought there was much due to APEC. 
The room was serviced twice daily and any issue was addressed quickly. Turn down service in PM was especially nice. It set the mood for a romantic return each night. Great touch for us Men!! The beds, linens and bathing products were extraordinary. Each item adding to a fabulous experience. 
The hotel was right across the street from the beach and each guest was supplied with a beach bag full of goodies to enjoy while relaxing on the beach. The pool, even though some say small,  was perfect for a quick lap or cooling off. It's not a pool for families looking to have splashing fun, but is perfect for relaxation. Each time we visited  was like having a private pool, since not many utilize it, and the attendant paid attention to our every need or want.
Waikiki downtown shopping is right around the corner. There actually is more choices and higher quality of dining and shopping closer to Trump than the other hotels on the beach. You can reach the far end of Waikiki Beach hotels and shopping with a twenty minute walk.So don't be fooled by the maps and how it looks far from the fun.
The hotel itself is beautiful. Every level is designed with quality. Don't confuse this hotel with one of Mr. Trump's casinos cause you would be sadly mistaken. This hotel is one of the best I have visited in a long time. Others say they are High Quality, but will have to reach far and high to reach this one. This by far is the #1 hotel on Island.
The staff was courteous, helpful and fun. They had a lot of activity to attend to during our visit due to APEC, but handled it with grace.We were treated just as well or better than the Prime Minister staying in the hotel. Couldn't ask for more!!
So I guess you can tell by my review that this is by far one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. It's true, and I look forward to returning many times in the near future!!!
I will be posting as many of our pictures allowed to show the up- to- date quality of this magnificent hotel

Everything about it made our stay in Hawaii our most memorable trip yet.  I would have to say the best thing about the hotel is the staff.  Everyone we encountered couldn't have been more helpful or friendly.  From the moment we checked in until check out we were made to feel like the only guests at the hotel.  The hotel itself is fantastic, clean, fresh and a really comfortable place to be.  There is a bar on the 1st floor which is open to the elements such is the weather in Hawaii and its a great place to sit and take in the view of Honolulu and the beach.  Our room was a one bedroom suite which had a partial view of the ocean and a great view of Honolulu.  I would actually recommend this side of the hotel as you get the best of both, the ocean and the Honolulu skyline at night (and also the Friday fireworks!).  If the island itself wasn't so beautiful then we could have easily spent our stay in the hotel room as it had everything we could possibly need and the fridge was stocked with the requests we had made before check-in.  Concierge service booked a couple of trips for us and were very really helpful with any other requests.  We found the location to be perfect, a 2 minute walk to the beach and the same walk to all shops and trolley stops in the Waikiki area.

Spacious with modern stylish fixtures/finishes. Bathroom with very complete lotions, toothpaste, toothbrush, etc. Nice greeting at check-in. Pool is small but modern and sunny all day. Gym is SMALL with limited equipment. They supply a beach bag with lotion, water and fruit.  Location is off the beach (quick/easy walk) and next to a park.  Restaurant served a good breakfast, the other a very good bento box lunch.  Stayed 6 days.  
  The service was ok, but not great. Housekeeping offers scheduled room cleaning. We called to set it at 2 pm. Next day, knocking on the door at 8:00 am. Day after, still not done at 2:30pm.  Then, after we called for the room to be done, no water by the bedside, doors left open in the kitchen, didn't replenish the sugar packets and no dish towels. (This was after APEC meeting was over, so no excuses there.) Left a note the next day and all was done but that should not have been necessary.  
  We rented scooters. Asked where we could park them. It was as if mopeds were alien and they weren’t sure what we should do. Spectacularly unhelpful.  
  When leaving, called for a cab to the airport at 12:00pm next day. Went down and there was no cab, they had to call one.
  In the room there was already wear and tear. Loose kitchen faucet, shower/tub that drips onto the floor (we had to put a towel on the rim), stains on the table, loose handles and cracks in the walls (see pictures).
  Overall, it’s very nice. However, for a place that touts its service (a private concierge – whom we never heard from) and has high prices, I expected a bit better.  (When leaving they asked if I had a “nice” time.  I said, “it was just ok.”  No more questions.)

We expected a lot based on the reviews and the Trump reputation and were not disappointed.","Date of stay: November 2011","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Changed at the last minute to Trump. Very happy we did. 

Almost gave this hotel an excellent rating. But in order to do that, everything must be flawless and they missed the mark upon arrival. More on that in a minute. 

Let me tell you what is right. Location, Service, Reception, Concierge, Pool (small but relaxing), ROOMS. If you've stayed at one Trump Hotel, you come to expect a certain level of service an amenities. 

Here's where the mark was missed just a bit.  Upon arrival, we pulled in behind a Jaguar and we were driving a small rental. Well guess who got the attention of two bellmen/doormen? My wife opened her own door and I was able to retrieve my luggage from the trunk before we were greeted. This generally doesn't happen at a Trump. Guess I need to rent a Jag the next time. 

Everything after this little snafu went flawlessly. Never has the reception agent left her desk, escorted us to the elevator, waited for it to arrive, loaded us, pressed the button and sent us on our way. WOW!!!

The rooms are a very nice size, appointed with top of the line(Sub Zero/Wolf) amenities and were SPOTLESS. We were happy with our view from the 17th floor of the ocean. The shower was strong and had very consistent hot water. Bedding was VERY comfortable and cozy.

Another great touch was upon checkout, we indicated that we had a late flight and the reception area extend to us the use of hospitality room until we were due to fly out.  I'm sure they do this quite often, but the way it was handled made us feel as if we were getting a little something extra.

Another great Trump Hotel","Date of stay: November 2011","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

The staff  were always friend;y and professional and nothing was too much to ask from a map to the local supermarket to laying out towels on the sun lounger! Also worth a mention is the BLT restaurant attached to the hotel we had the most amazing steak of our whole trip!! Our room was really nice too, we had a city view which was exactly what it sounds but that was what we paid for! the little kitchen area was great and really well equipped and gave us the freedom to cater for our own breakfasts and lunches! The only slight negative was the pool was very small and not really for swimming more for quick cool down but the beach was about 20 metres away so not really a problem and the pool being on the sixth floor with amazing views for sunset and the beach made up for the size! definitely recommend this hotel for couples!!","Date of stay: November 2011","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The concierges and other staff were friendly and helpful. The rooms were nice, but one complaint - the closet. It was the smallest closet I've ever seen in a hotel room. (And I've traveled quite a bit.)  It barely had room for any of my clothes or shoes. Not certain if it was this way in all one-bedroom suites or not. The only other complaint would be the price of room service and what you get for your money. I realize that everything is expensive in Hawaii and in the hotels, but we ordered a plate of cottage cheese with fruit and it was quite disappointing. Barely any fruit on the plate and with all of the charges (tax, gratuity, service charges), it was almost $40. Crazy. (And this wasn't the only example). But to end on a positive note...I would definitely recommend Trump for people looking to stay in a nice hotel in Waikiki very close to the beach.","Date of stay: October 2011","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

We stayed here for 9 nights and we did not want to go home!  This is by far the MOST luxurious place we have ever stayed but what made it outstanding is that everyone was friendly and helpful- not {...] kissing to get tips.  They think of everything you need from the beach bag complete with water, sunscreen and towels to the kitchenette in the rooms complete with dishes, wine glasses, toaster, rice cooker etc.  Free in room wifi and business center offers free printing for boarding passed etc.  We booked a tour through Sav-On Tours and the faxed was dropped off in our room discreetly.

We were here for our wedding so it was nice to find a bottle of wine on ice when we got to our room.  Twice they dropped chocolates off in our room. We were upgraded to a larger room with a sitting area which was perfect for getting ready on the wedding day.  When we needed more hangers/water/coffee creamer, house keeping was always quick to respond.

Location wise it was perfect.  Since we were there with our immediate family, it was important everyone stayed in close proximity.  Embassy and Outrigger Reef were just across the street and The Halekulani was only a little past Outrigger (everything was 2 minutes walk).

The pool is a bit small but it had a spa and view of the sea on one side.  The Trump Spa was very friendly and accommodating.  We had purchased a gift card but could not use it during our stay and they let us return it. Everything simply was perfect during our stay and we loved it.

TIP: Valet parking is $28/day at Trump so if you are staying for 3+ days consider using the Hale Koa open parking lot by getting their multi-day pass.  The parking lot is right across from the Trump lobby and the Military Museum.  You cross Seratoga and it's that fenced in lot. Get the multi-day pass from the Hale Koa parking garage structure for $16/day.","Date of stay: October 2011","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We found the staff very effective and pleasant.  We weren't disappointed by anything at the Trump.  The rooms are indenpendently owned, and are rented out when the owners don't use them.  Just a short walk to the beach, and the staff gives you a beach bag loaded with goodies.  We had an ocean view with a balconey.  Short walks to shopping.

After exiting our taxi, we were greeted by hotel staff with a kukui shell lei and then escorted to the 6th floor reception/ check-in desk. After a smooth check-in and being presented with infused-water and cold towels to refresh ourselves with, we were shown to our 21st floor room and our fabulous view. Upon entering our ocean-facing room, we were surprised at the size of our room and the gorgeous bathroom. The sizable entryway included two large closets and a kitchenette, which included a refrigerator, burner-equipped stove, marble-countertops, coffee-maker with kona-blend coffee included, and all the plates, glasses, and cookware needed to prepare a full meal in-room. After leaving the entryway, we discovered a very spacious bathroom with tile floors and marble-countertops with double-vanity. The shower was a large open-shower design with no curtain and the tub was a large deep-set soaking tub with all the required amenities. The amenities, by the way, were plentiful and the highest-quality I have ever had of any top hotel chains. The room itself had a very comfortable king-bed, armchair, sofa, high-def flat-screen, and comfortable working desk. We spent most of our time on the lanai enjoying the view of the ocean and rainbows. The lanai itself was sizable, with two chairs and a glass-topped table. The Pacific is one block away from the hotel, with chairs and an umbrella available for Trump guests. If you request one, the concierge will provide a beach bag with snacks, bottled water, and suntan lotion complimentary. Restaurants abound everywhere around the hotel. The main drag in Waikiki is one block away, as well. The service that is employed at this hotel must be the best on the island. I hope for another chance in the future to stay here again.

The service was the best I've ever had at any hotel.  Everybody was extremely friendly and accommodating.

The hotel was extremely clean.  Part of this may be because it is fairly new (two years old).

Stayed in a deluxe city view room (which did have partial ocean views as well from the lanai).  Beds were extremely comfortable and there was a sofa bed as well!  Washroom was large with a separate shower and bath area.

The kitchenette was small.  Agree with other reviewers in that a small table may have been useful addition.

Used the gym facilities which were small.  The infinity pool was smaller than expected as well but top notch.

Had a late flight and was surprised that they allowed late check-out (had the room until 8 pm the next day)

In terms of location, it is a two or three minute walk to the heart of Waikiki and a two minute walk to the beach (across the street).  Incidentally, a nice beach bag with towels, fruit, water and sunscreen lotion is provided at the concierge.

This was just the icing on the cake. We absolutely LOVED this hotel. The service is impeccable, all staff are proactive and constantly seeking to improve your experience. The hotel does not have an ocean frontage but the views across the adjoining memorial park to the ocean are amazing! It is just a short walk to the beach.  Trump offers a beach bag for their guests including complimentary bottled water, fruit, towels and sunscreen. The thought and attention to detail of every aspect of this hotel is unlike any other I have ever stayed at. On arrival, you are greeted with a smile, lei, infused water and cool towel. The staff are all very professional and courteous, remembering their guests names.  The rooms are light, fresh and modern. They are contemporary whilst maintaining an understanding of their beachside, holiday location. Every night housekeeping check ‘re-fresh’ your room replacing used bath towels, removing rubbish, folding down the bed, laying out your robes and placing bottled water on the bed side. The gym offers the latest and best equipment and provides complimentary sports beverages and infused waters. The pool is a little small but is more than adequate to cool down. The pool side services is also very good and the attendee was very helpful and efficient.  The only issue I found with the hotel was that it was located on the end of Waikiki Beach with a bit more shore fringing reef (than say Royal Hawaiian / Out Rigger etc.). I is also a bit further from the main surfy break.  However, you can find sandy patches and it is quieter.

If you love your own home, this will feel like home. If you are trying to get away from your own place, this will be an oasis. For us, we felt like we were in our own apartment except we were in Oahu, so it was truly very comfortable. It was our first time in Waikiki and first time at a Trump property. Housekeeping was wonderful - they service the room exactly when you request it. They have a pillow menu - we got body pillows and knee bolsters. Our suite had a full kitchen with high end appliances, a den, and a washer/dryer (just like home!  The two bathrooms were large and the walk in showers had no curtains - other reviewers said the shower splashed all over the bathroom but ours did not. The master did splash over the deep soaking tub but toilet was in a separate room; the second bathroom's shower had a half wall that managed to contain the water. We had two lanais with ocean views - the sunsets were magnificent and breathtaking. 

The hotel amenities were luxurious but understated. There's no wow factor lobby - it's not a museum, it's subtle, elegant condo environment, not a shopping mall. Key cards are required in the elevators and only stop at your floor. The staff is very professional - friendly but unobtrusive.

Well first and foremost, I am extremely surprised that this hotel could even have been listed as Number 1.  Is it such a bad hotel - not really.  The decor is modern, rooms comfortable although not exactly luxurious and the best thing going for it is the very friendly and helpful staff.  WIFI is free too.  Location is relatively good - the tram cars stop very near the hotel and it is a short 10 minute walk to the shops where Chanel, Gucci and others are located.

However, for this hotel to be Number 1, I would have expected more.  The pool in the hotel is surprisingly small and uninviting - no one really swims in it while we were there.  The whole feel of the hotel does not really compare to other better 5 star hotels and I would rate it as a mediocre 5 star hotel.  The hotel is also not beach fronting and a 5 minute walk to the beach.  The beach near the hotel is also not exactly the best and is only the start of Waikiki Beach.  We preferred to walk down further Waikiki Beach where Westin and other hotels are and that is where all the action and activities are.

We did not really regret staying at this hotel as the people were really friendly and the hotel facilities adequate, but knew we could have done better.  Knowing what we know now, we may want to try other hotels next time - probably in the center of Waikiki where Westin (which looks really nice) and Sheraton are located.","Date of stay: September 2011","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

We were in Honolulu and Wailea (Maui) during our trip and stayed at 4 hotels (Trump, The Modern Honolulu, Marriott Wailea, and Fairmont Kea Lani)... the Trump was by far the best stay of the entire trip!

We booked on the stay 4 nights and get the 4th night free deal so we ended up getting a pretty good price especially compared to the other places we stayed considering how much better the Trump was!  The hotel was at full occupancy when we stayed here but did not feel crowded or too busy.  All the staff are so nice, from the bellmen to the concierge to reception and even the housekeeping staff is always smiling and friendly.  The service here is top notch.

We stayed in a deluxe studio city view which ended up having a bit of a view of Waikiki beach from the lanai.  The rooms are nice – clean and modern with small Hawaiian touches.  The beds are so comfortable and the sheets really soft…even the towels in the bathroom were Egyptian cotton.  We received fresh towels twice a day and they always provided more than enough.  

Turndown service is very good – they really pay attention to detail at the Trump.  The room was super clean – housecleaning did a fantastic job, and the hotel itself is still in new condition. We found a pretty big bug in the room on our last day but it probably crawled in from the lanai or the hallway – not too sure.  Even despite this (and my huge fear of bugs) I would stay at the Trump again!

The only “con” I’d like to mention is that the pool is quite small.  We were prepared for this as you can easily tell from the pictures of the pool that it is small.  We only used it on our last day after we checked out and for the rest of our stay, we went to the beach (took advantage of the complimentary pool bags from concierge).  The beach is across the street, probably a 2 minute walk. The sand at Waikiki is softest in front of the Sheraton/Royal Hawaiian hotels and is worth the short treck.

I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who won’t be fussed about a small pool.  It is in a fantastic location being within short walking distance of Waikiki beach, beachwalk and much of the shopping and restaurants. I really dislike older hotels as I hate staying in places where wear and tear is obvious and the rooms are not modern - so compared to many other hotels that I researched for this trip, the Trump meets my standards and many of the hotels in that area are older and the rooms do not look as nice.","Date of stay: October 2011","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Yes, parking there is expensive but only marginally more so than the place we'd been staying before; the guaranteed spot made it worth it.  Yes, the pool is small but the spa was very nice and the view was awesome.  We were there on a Sunday night so it was quiet at the pool.

Parking there is quite expensive, but not unexpected for the area (or any big city, for that matter).  The daily fee allows in-out privileges, fortunately, but that means a lot of tips.

What a disappointment.

I have never writen a bad review, but this hotel was very average and not worth my hard earned money. Firstly we arrived at 2pm (my mistake, as i thought check in was from 2pm), but it is 4pm which seems strange to me especailly if you were only staying here for 1 night (what a waste of money that would be) anyway we were extremly excited about our choice of hotels for our last 4 nights in Waikiki, we had previously stayed at the Outrigger Reef for 8 nights ( group of ten family and friends for my 40th birthday), then went off to the Big Island for 2 nights in a resort to do a helecopter flight. So i was surprise to find that when we got out of our taxi from the airport the so called first impression you get of the Trump Complex is like a messy railway station with bags everywhere, and staff running around. ( this did not change the whole time we where there we spent  time ducking and weaving around all the luggage, unless it was 2am in the morning). Surley they could keep the area free, with such a huge building they couldnt fit in a room to place luggage and keep the area tidy and clear?????? Not a good first impression.

We couldnt even get ourselves and our bags to the lift, to go up to the 6 floor lobby, this was not what we were expecting of such an expensive hotel.Once we went to check in we were told that our room wasnt ready, which was fine, as i got the time wrong with check in, we booked a deluxe 2 bedroom ocean view room and told to return about 4.15 pm. I was also surprised that we werent given more information about the hotel and what they had to offer to maybe grab and drink at their bar or maybe grab some lunch??? etc etc So we got back in the lift and went back across the road to the Outrigger Reef and had lunch and drinks at the Shore Bird.

We came back after 4pm and were told our room was now ready... we were very excited.... The room was clean, not very big between the lounge room and kitchen, you had to pick your bag up about chest height to move it to my bedroom as the kitchen and lounge were in the way, is was proven by all the dents and paint marks on the wall were people have tryed to drag their bags into the bedroom. I thought this was a little odd. We also noticed on our arrival to the room that the dish washer was on from previous guests. I CANT believe that I had to empty the dishwasher so i could use it myself, i did not pay over $800.00 a night to empty others dishes. We got a call asking if everything was ok a couple of ours later, and i explained i was a little concerned why i had to empty the dish washer, and also asked for some tea towels as there was nothing to dry your dishes with. I was told they would bring me some, and apologised for the dish washer not being emptyed before we checked in. Ofcourse i NEVER heard another thing, and ofcourse NEVER got the tea towels. So all our dishes had to go into the dish washer, seemed like a waste of water to me if we only had a couple of dishes.

The view was lovley thats for sure, bedrooms very basic there were no cupboards, only space for you to hang some clothes. The bathrooms were getting old, my toilet paper holder was coming away from the wall and i had to keep trying to tighten it myself as the toilet paper keept falling off, this did surprise me as i assumed that the cleaner would realise this when they replaced toilet paper reguarly, but figured by the 3rd night this wasnt going to happen,

The Pool.... oh my god.... how can they even call it one???? There are 37 floors in the Trump building and the pool would only hold about 20 maxium, it's a tiny lap pool, with only about 15 lounge chairs around it, dont stay here if you expect to go for a swim, we ceratinly didnt, although was so looking forward to it. Massive disappointment.

I would never stay here again, and after day 2 we nearly packed up and left, but were pretty sure we would get our money back, the one great thing about this place is their Mai-Tais, they are amazing, and recently won an award for best Mai-Tai.

So i say to you, dont stay here and waste your money, go to the Outrigger Reef, a much better place to stay and right on the ocean, and cheaper, but still lovley rooms. Go to Trump for a Mai Tai and leave it at that.... Spend your money on much better things!!!","Date of stay: October 2011","Trip type: Traveled with friends","ui_bubble_rating bubble_20"

The rooms are good, clean and the bed fantastic however this is where is stops. Firstly the TV did not work and they could not fix for about 24hrs. That was no so much of a problem but the breakfast was terrible, for the price they charge I would expect better, for example the juice came from a can and they charge $6 for it. We did not try any other food here based on the breakfast. The pool area is very small and when we were there very busy. 

There is some nice touches like having beach bags for you that have towels, water, sun screen and a snack it. While there is nothing really wrong with it for the price you pay it just leaves you a bit disappointed.","Date of stay: October 2011","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

Both the accommodation and service were second to none.  We have never received as warm a welcome in any hotel that we have stayed in before and we have stayed in lots of hotels in the USA.  As soon as we set foot on the property, the staff could not do enough for us, they were so efficient in whisking our bags away and personally escorting us up to reception to check in where cold flannels and drinks were waiting while we signed in (no queue at all).  Then we were escorted to our room and shown all the facilities.  We had been upgraded to a fantastic one bedroom, two bathroom suite with full kitchen, it was amazing, better equipped than our own kitchen at home.  As we were unpacking, room service delivered a complimentary bottle of chilled sparkling wine to congratulate us on our marriage, which was a lovely gesture.  The bed was so comfortable, it was like sleeping on a cloud!  We cannot fault the hotel or the staff, nothing was too much trouble for them, it's a fabulous place, very welcoming and really close to all the city centre attractions and beach, we would go back in a heartbeat, it was our best trip ever!","Date of stay: October 2011","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We are a young couple in our 30s, and were pleasantly pleased when we got a good air/hotel package at the Trump.  Normally this is a $300/night hotel, and Tripadvisors were boasting about the numerous amenities.  We had to see for ourselves, as we love the newer style Vegas hotels like the Wynn.

We arrived pretty late on a Sunday night, tired and ready for bed.  We took the Robert's shuttle from HNL and were swiftly greeted at the Bell Hop desk with beautiful his and hers shell Leis.  We were then directed to the Lobby on an upper floor where we had the fastest check-in ever. So fast we were simply given her keys, and told which room to go to.  No orientation of any sort, but it was late, and they told us that the Concierge would be at our disposal.

We arrived to our room, and although it was definitely far from huge (we had an Embassy Suites facing studio), it was probably really nice by Waikiki standards. There was a mini kitchen, a huge bathroom (which I actually loved), a Lanai, and a very comfy bed.  There were plenty of complimentary bottles of water, and the next day we acquainted ourselves with the hospitality of this hotel.  If you pay to stay here make sure you utilize the services of the Concierge on the ground floor. From beach bags to water, to reservation services they went above and beyond.  Note you will get charged to make any sort of call from your room, but the Concierge will do it for free, and there is a free phone in the lobby as well.  

The location was actually great, and although still within walking distance of everything (block away from the beach, many ABC stores, the Sheraton, Reef, Halekulani to name a few), it was away from the chaos of the strip.  We didn't rent a car, and walked almost everywhere.  We frequented the Royal Hawaiian and nearby Duke's.  The only time we left the area was our one day Robert's Circle Island tour (recommended if you don't have a car), and a couple bus trips to Ala Moana.

We noticed many guests took advantage of the kitchen and drove to Safeway to get groceries.  Something to note for future reference as there aren't many groceries nearby. There is a BLT restaurant downstairs which you get 15% off at as a guest, and we wanted to try their acclaimed happy hour, but it was fully booked when we looked on Opentable.  So many restaurants nearby like Roy's (didn't try), House without a Key (loved it), Duke's for breakfast (went twice), Sherton's Kai Market buffet, and the good old standby Cheesecake factory.  You can also get the pineapple Dole Whip at Peet's at the Sheraton down the street. You won't go hungry! I honestly didn't find dining out that expensive.  The shopping, on the other hand, is true luxury high end shopping.  

I did sit by the pool once at the hotel, and it was actually lovely and not full.  I wish I took a dip in the beautiful infinity pool!  The service there is next to none. The minute you arrive you will be asked ""sun or shade"" and towels will be nicely placed on the chair of your choice for your comfort!!  I felt like it was almost too much!  I fell asleep after a strong Mai Tai from House without a Key, and almost suffered heat stroke so be warned of the powers of the Hawaiian sun.

EXTRA NOTES:
Traffic is bad in waikiki. Plan accordingly. TheBus was actually pretty good (ask for a transfer).  Those Hop On Hop Off buses take forever.

Everyone is very laid back, and you won't need to pack much.  This is one of the charms of Hawaii.  Upscale at the Trump for sure, but not pretentious.

Free Wifi throughout the hotel.

Eat the fruit here---so good!!   

Watch the Friday fireworks from the lobby pool.

Only suggestion for the Trump: the air conditioning vents shot directly at the bed, which was a bit much, even on the lowest setting. It gets stuffy without it. A happy medium would be ceiling fans.

As their website states, ""attention without being pretensious"" is a fact.  This is an upscale place, but with the relaxed Hawaiian atmosphere. I think the best part of the hotel was the employees. Everyone was so kind and friendly, always going out of their way to see if you needed anything, without being phony or overbearing. From the valets to the various assistants at the conciegre desk and lobby, to the housekeeping staff, it was always with a kind smile and genuine attitude.
We were greeted with a wonderful treat, an upgrade from a two bedroom oceanview suite to a two bedroom with den oceanfront suite.  This hotel has a great location, especially if your room is on the west side overlooking Fort DeRussy Park. Room was very nice, comfy beds, lots of ammenties. Probably more then we needed, but very nice.
We are common people, so the understated elegance was nice. Hakelani is nice, but seemed a little to chi-chi for us.  Every employee watching every move unless you are dressed in dinner attire every second of the day.
The Trumps chic smaller infinity pool compared to the giant family driven beach resorts was nice. You are in Hawaii, go to the beautiful beach across the street!!! 
There are lots of services the hotel offers that we didnt partake in or need so I cannot comment on those.  We ate at BLT Steak.  Great food and service, although I know its not officially part of the hotel, but just on the property.
Overall I would stay here again on our next trip to Waikiki.  Great location being on the west end of the strip. Stayed at Moana 2 years ago and it was a nightmare trying to get back down there most nights if we took the car.
FT DeRussy beach was a great public beach without the public, LOL,  its mostly the tourists from nearby hotels. Lots of of room and with the military boys all over, you feel safe.

The hotel is beautiful, sleek, modern..  The view from our 6th floor room was beautiful, taking in a gorgeous expanse of ocean, a lovely park and at night, the city lights.  It's a short walk down a sidewalk to the beach and the hotel loans you beach bags complete with towels, bottles of water and fruit.  They'll throw in sunscreen if you need it too -- a nice touch.  The service, from everyone at Trump was exceptional.  We got off the shuttle from the airport and one of the bellmen ran down the driveway to get our bags.  The front desk staff were friendly and we got leis there too.  We ordered room service and were told 30 minutes -- it arrived in 15 and the person who delivered it was friendly and full of smiles.  The concierge desk on the main level was extremely helpful, calling shuttles for us to visit Pearl Harbor, Diamond Head and to return to the airport.  The room was spacious, very clean and had a kitchenette which was very well outfited if you wanted to cook there.  The bathroom was huge with a deep tub and open shower concept -- very cool.  Turn down service was also very nice with the bathrobes and TV remote placed on the beds and a cold bottle of water on each bed-side table.  We received a bottle of champagne for our honeymoon, having told them before we arrived , what occasion we were celebrating.  The proximity to the main shopping street was very close, and to Waikiki beach, where all the action is.  We walked everywhere, to shopping and restaurants, very easily.  The infiinity pool was small -- 2 swimming lanes -- but it was all you really needed, and the hot tub was a good size.  We had breakfast at the hotel which had a good assortment on the buffet.  All in all, a beautiful place to stay and we'd definitely stay there again.","Date of stay: September 2011","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Often when I stay at a pricy hotel I feel my fees are going to gimmicks such as a huge pool or other ""amenities"" I rarely use however I felt the rump Waikiki was worth every penny.  The property is upscale without being pretentious.  The condo (deluxe ocean view studio) was modern, with high end finishes and appliances.  The staff is incredibly friendly and makes you feel like you are not just a number.  I can't remember the last time I stayed at a hotel where I was shown this level of Aloha (at any price).  The location is excellent.  I prefer to venture to less crowded beaches on the island but if you want to hang out on Waikiki beach it's just across the street.  Vehicle access to / from the hotel is easy without getting stuck in heavy downtown traffic.  The hotel is located within easy walking distance of the shops in Waikiki.  Although the time of year (September) was probably a factor, I particularly enjoyed not seeing a ton of kids running around.  Seems to mostly appeal to people looking for luxury accommodations without a bunch of kids; I like that.  I didn't eat at BLT Steak but I can tell you Wailou was fantastic for a casual restaurant.  Small menu but the food is elegantly prepared and far above what I was expecting for a casual hotel restaurant.  I also appreciated the library where I was able to print my boarding pass before heading out to the airport.  For me personally I don't see a reason to stay anywhere else but the Trump when visiting Honolulu.  The property left such a positive impression that I have little interest in checking out other hotels in the area.","Date of stay: September 2011","Trip type: Traveled solo","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We stayed here 8 nights celebrating our 28 wedding anniversay.  I completed the pre-arrival form for the Attache and requested car service from hotel and some grocery items.  Attache Coordinator responded congratulating us on anniversay and said a complimentary bottle of wine would be in room upon our arrival.  She asked some questions about the pickup and grocery.  I responded to her but never got any confirmation about request.  I had to call hotel when I was at the airport to ensure my pickup was set.  They did not have our pickup on file but said they would ensure it is confirmed.  I was getting on a plane so they couldn't call me back but I got their voicemail when we landed.

Upon arrival, car was there.  Hotel was very busy when we got there around 7:00 p.m. but bellman did take our luggage, gave us our leis and asked us to go to the 6th floor to check-in.  No melon infused water for us either but they were busy and everyone was trying to do what they can.  It was a nice surpise to find out we were upgraded to a 1 bedroom suite.  There was no bottle of wine in room but there were some brownies.  Grocery items were also in room.  We also got some chocolate on our 3rd night.

The hotel highly promotes their personalized service but the Attache never checked in with us during our stay.  Someone called on our last day to see if we needed anything.  I had requested a return car service when I asked for my pickup but they didn't have it on file.

Room was a good size, 2 bathrooms and having a kitchen was great.  High-end appliances in kitchen but fixtures in bathrooms were surprising low-end.  Bed is amazingly comfortable. Furnishing were new but  they really need to continue to keep up with the maintanance.  Under cabinet lights in kitchen were out, dryer door was cracked and carpet was showing some wear.  

Pool was very small but pool service was great.  Drinks and food at pool also very good but expensive.  Breakfast at hotel is over-priced but again service was good.  Beach bag is a nice touch.  If not for that, I would have chosen a hotel by the beach.  Sunscreen and bottled water much appreciated but they should improve on the quallity of fruit given.  Everyone at the hotel was very helpful.  They even gave us a hospitality suite on the day of check-out so we can shower and change before heading to the airport in the late afternoon.

Service, room, food, drinks were all great but just not quite a 5 star...but almost.  If I could, I would give it a 4.5.","Date of stay: September 2011","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

It is brand new so the rooms are in really good condition and everything is immaculate.  The house service is brilliant; towels changed twice a day, turn down service in the evenings, they even did our dishes!  Easy to get used to and lovely to come home to after a day at the beach or exploring.  Also nice to have the water bottles constantly replenished.  The bathrobes are fab ($130 if you want to buy one, and I was very tempted!) and the beds are really really comfortable.  Nice view from the balcony.  Good location, very close to the beach and all shops and restaurants.  Perfect for a young couple on honeymoon.

The staff are very friendly but sometimes I did find it a little false.  The hotel promotes its Attache service which is designed to personalise the guest's experience but we didn't experience the 'personal' touch.  We had told the hotel we were on honeymoon prior to our arrival, and there was a lovely bottle of Prosecco in the room waiting for us, however, I found out after that my sister had tried to organise this for us, and it was only after she phoned the hotel that they said they would put something in the room.  I'm not complaining about a freebie - it just seems to me that they should have already known that was why were were staying because I had filled in the forms that they sent to us which were designed to personalise our experience.  I know it is picking, because the staff were friendly, but I have worked in hotels for years and I found their personal touch lacking, particularly in the welcome and the goodbye.

There are a few wee things that we think it is important for people to consider when booking this hotel.

1) The pool is very small.  This wasn't a problem for us but it was full of kids and I can't imagine why anyone would take kids to this hotel.  It can't have been much fun for them and their games, whilst not an issue, would have been better in a larger resort hotel.
2) The bar isn't very lively.  Not an issue because there are lots of other lively bars in the vicinity but if you are looking for a hotel with a vibrant nightlife, this isn't it.
3) It is expensive!  I made the mistake of asking for a jug of milk for coffee and it cost me $28!!  Bit steep.

Overall though, we would definitely go back for the room alone.  The kitchen area is a great addition and the room itself suited us perfectly.  Dinner in the BLT restaurant was also very good.  I would probably have given a 4.5 if the option was available, but I'm more than happy to award 5 stars.","Date of stay: September 2011","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The room was of a high standard and the bathroom a good size.

Throughout our three day stay the staff were pleasant and efficient.

My one complaint is the breakfast buffet which for two cost just under $70 and was of a poor standard, the selection was limited and they had run out of orange juice. I believe that the food looked tired as there were not man guests eating there - another table had occasion to complain to the waiter due to the it took them to be served.

Breakfast aside an excellent hotel well placed for beach and shops - try eggs and things for breakfast on the same block voted best place for breakfast in Honolulu.

Our best sun destination hotel stay EVER!!!","The hotel's reputation for service does live up to the hype!  We got a hotel+flight deal online and it was a fantastic deal compared to getting the room direct.  We had already decided on a different hotel, when one last search yielded this one at a price point and airline that was acceptable to us.  This price was actually about $50 better than staying at a 4-star in the Waikiki area...so why wouldn't we try this one since it's ranked number one on Tripadvisor!

We arrived and felt welcomed.  No different treatment than other reviewers even though we got the great promo rate.  There was a high quality, thick white shell lei greeting for me and a thick kukui nut lei for my spouse.  We were conducted to the hotel checkin lobby from the taxi drop off, by Linda who was courteous, interested in our travels, and polite.  During our seamless checkin, Linda even reappeared with a cold glass of fruit infused water and a cool facecloth infused with lemongrass. That was a wonderful greeting after a 9.5 hour flight!  We were even upgraded from a city view room to a partial ocean view room on the 12th floor.

There are too many things to love about the hotel, so I'll just list our absolute faves in point form:
1.  Large studio suite and bathrooms, although the bathroom lacked for counter space with just the semi-pedestal sink.
2.  Turn down service nightly.  We only got treats on the first night of our week long stay, but it was displayed artistically and tasted yummy.
3.  The beach bag service they offer at the attaché desk on the ground floor was awesome!  We used it for our snorkel, underwater scooter trip, and our lazy morning on Waikiki beach day!  You have to return the bag and the towels when you return, but they include cold water, fresh fruit, and pro sunblock that blends on smoothly as if it were moisturizer.  One of the best sunblocks I've ever used.
4.  The 12 item pillow menu... In case you don't like their 50/50 poly/down blend, they have ones that are allergy free, comfortable for neck, comfortable for hip, knee, etc.  They also half a dozen scented ones to relieve stress or to energize you or restore balance.  Look for the menu on the same tray as the laundry services.
5.  Soft comfortable king sized beds.  No trouble sleeping at all while we were there.
6.  Friendly and courteous staff.
7.  Responsive housekeeping. --- they brought up extra toilet paper and tissues within 5 minutes of the call down.
8.  Loved the included lanai balcony, where we enjoyed sunrise and breakfasts every morning.
9.  Everyone working there was mindful of our comfort and enjoyment.  Several times, the staff even waited for the next elevator, so we could have an unencumbered ride down.  Always, the staff were anticipating our needs... Like the busgirl who offered to take our photo on the lobby floor while sunset was happening and we had our camera poised.
10.  Location! Location! LOCATION!  It is on the same street as stops for the Waikiki Trolley, the hop on/ hop off double decker tour bus, and various tour bus pickup sites.  You can walk 1 minute to Waikiki beach(although this may not be a prime beach spot), less than 2 minutes to area restaurants or ABC stores, 4 minutes to the Royal Hawaiian shopping mall, 5 minutes to Duty Free shopping mall, 10 minutes to the other side of Waikiki beach nearer to the zoo and aquarium (but probably more like 20 minutes to actually get there).

A few small things that could have been better:
1.  On one of our snorkel tours, we were 5th in line at the attaché desk, but all we wanted was the beach bag... Someone had valet parked their car(which I believe is the only option), and was retrieving it, and managed to get one of the bellboys to grab a couple of beach bags for him.  We then asked him to retrieve a bag for us.  At that busy time in the morning(7:15-7:25am), there should be more than one person staffing the attaché desk.  We were afraid we would miss our appointed bus pick up time in the lineup.  Behind us were another dozen people.  All of them were Japanese, so they may have been too afraid to step out of line to ask someone else for a beach bag - I hope they didn't miss their bus tour that morning.  That was the only morning where there was any kind of lineup at the attaché desk while we were there.
2.  The studios don't have a full closet, only half.  The top half is used for spare towels, pillows, vanity mirror, hair dryer.  If you have a full sized dress, it will not hang full length.  Luckily, I only had a 3/4 length, which just fit.
3.  The writing desk came with a dried up pen.  When I listen to the welcome message from The attaché desk, I had no writing implement with which to take her name and number.  A later call for a new pen remedied the problem with two new pens after a day.
4.  The shower is very Asian/tropical style, with removal shower heads and located beside the tub, but with no door to stop from spraying onto floor.  You can minimize wetness to bathroom floor by angling away and by putting the bath matt down in front of the tiles.  It wasn't a problem for us, since we've used this style of shower before, but something robe aware of.
5.  Internet was spotty.  It worked well at the spot on the sofa just in front of our lanai balcony, and on the bed near the desk.  We both had mobile devices, not a hardwired connection.

On Friday nights, the Hilton has fireworks.  We watched from Wai'olua restaurant on 6th floor lanai seating.  You need to make reservations via the concierge/attaché service.  They were very helpful.  I'll do a write up for the restaurant separately, but our server was Kiele and she was awesome.  Helpful in suggestions, and mindful of all my allergies and food intolerances.  The chef even changed up a couple of menu items so I could have them!  The fireworks were amazing and surprisingly loud from that vantage point.

We had already committed to the GO Oahu Card before picking the Trump, otherwise, I would have loved to use their legendary attaché services to book our outings.  The GO card worked well for us, so we stuck with them for other bookings not covered by the GO card.

Overall, it was the best hotel we have ever stayed at.  If you can find a great deal, then it is definitely worth it over any 4 or 5- star hotel or resort that you could stay at.  Even without a great online deal,  the Trump Waikiki just may become our splurge hotel of choice.  :-)","Date of stay: September 2011","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I built a really high expectation of the service and their attention to detail that sadly were not met. 

There were no strawberry infused water upon arriving at the hotel for check in, no complimentary upgrade even though we were celebrating our anniversary and no snacks/drinks left by housekeeping each day. Turn down service was performed at 9:24pm, way too late for people dealing with jet lag. Some of the fruit given in the beach bag were rotting already. We basically got exactly what we paid for and nothing else.

I also used their spa service and was shocked how tiny it was. Last time I was at a 5 star hotel spa was at Encore in Vegas. The difference is night and day. There is no sauna, dry steam room, jacuzzi, whirlpool etc. Just a couple of small treatment rooms. The massage itself was also not as great as the one at Encore. Upon paying for the service, I found out that the price was actually $35 higher than the spa brochure in my room because it was an outdated one. The spa wasn't able to fully honor the price difference and I didn't feel like arguing in front out other guests who were there to relax. Only upon checking out did I mention it to the front desk, who then finally sorted it out with the spa the next day. I was refunded the entire amount for my troubles. I appreciated the gesture, but wished they could've just given me the old brochure price at the time so I wouldn't have felt uneasy for the rest of my stay.

I believe the reason Trump is ranked #1 hotel on TA is because it goes above and beyond people's expectations. For me, it met my basic expectations but nothing beyond that. The nicest part of this hotel was the valet, who would turn on the GPS for us when retrieving the car knowing that it takes a few min to receive signal. Not sure if I would be back to this property, might have to look into other options first.","Date of stay: September 2011","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

It was an amazing experience from start to finish.  Shell lei's upon arrival, fruit infused water while you wait for your room, excellent bell captain and valet services.  We selected a room with washer-dryer--what a great amenity.  Not having to buy clothes during the trip saved time and $.  One day, I was not feeling well, and the bell captain remembered and always asked how I was feeling.  The personal touch and aloha spirit of the staff was truly appreciated.  We cannot wait to return to this amazing hotel.

A few tips/suggestions:  I would select a room away from the elevator-I found the hallways to have an echo and be a little on the loud side.
BLT for dinner is a must.  Popovers and shrimp cocktail the size of my head.
Skip the pool.  It's good for sunbathing, but the wind tunnel effect and non-heated pool are turn offs.
Be careful in the bathroom!  The marble floor gets very slippery when wet.  I wiped out on the floor :(, and have a nice bruise on the knee as a souvenir--ha ha!","Date of stay: September 2011","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Once the new Trump property opened, it offered a good opportunity to stay in a new, true 5 star hotel and also experience the old-school Waikiki beach.  It is correct that the property is not right on the beach - it is a one block walk along a path through a park-like area.  We saw this as a plus because it seems like the beach could get loud with partiers at night.  The Trump hotel is lovely.  Clean, warm contemporary interior.  Very well maintained.  I reserved a 1 bedroom and was upgraded to a two bedroom with two full baths and a full sized, fully equipped kitchen.  It was awesome.  I could live in this space.  It was so nice I was inspired to cook a full meal with the live shrimp we purchased from Fumi's on the North Shore.  The room was very clean and maid service was excellent - albeit one evening we had to call to find out when turn-down would occur.  I also took advantage of a 4th night free promotion, so the rate was reasonable for what we had.  The entire staff is well trained and extremely warm and friendly.

Most bathroom accessories were provided with the exception of bath salts which I have found to be standard in other hotels of this quality.

We had chosen this hotel after many weeks reading reviews. Loved the idea that they are kid friendly, and so on...I had emailed the hotel after we booked and advised this was our honeymoon. They had upgraded us to a suite, which was beautiful! Cookies for my son and a bottle of champagne for us....very nice. We are not wealthy people at all. When I say we treated ourselves to this trip, I mean it was quiet an expensive stay for 4 days....totalled $2000! Would we stay here again, no. Not for the money that we spent and the extra costs we incurred. It really isn't on the stip and there is nothing that really made us say, wow, we will def come back. we have stayed in a lot of nice properties, but for the Trump experience, I expected to be WOWED!

We arrived at night, and it was perfect to get to a hotel where you felt comforatble and relaxed. Service was always friendly and helpful esp. the concierage. She gave us tons of info and local tips for our day trip to the North Shore, as we had a rental the entire trip. 

The ""Beach""....what a joke! We were advised that the Trump has a beach area, so we decided to go and spend some time there. The beach bag that they lend you was nice. filled with water, apples, sunscreen and towels. They advise you to walk across the road and it will be clearly marked. Well, when we arrived at the beach, with the 2000 other people, we were quiet taken back. It was rows and rows and ROWS of beach chairs that are clusted into different colored groups, that are 3 inches apart from each other. So after walking a bit, and a vendor finally noticing our Trump bag, asked if we were looking for the Trump area. He advised that there were only 2 chairs left (near the back) and that the daily fee is going to be $35...it was 4 in th afternoon!!! So after all that work we tried to settle in and my husband and son went to play in the water, only to find them more just sitting on the shore. The sand was so rough, it was more like small rocks. All of our feet had scrpaes and cuts on them from trying to stand in that area. We stayed 20 minutes, and I went back to the rental desk and asked if we really had to pay the full $35 dollars, as we were laeving due to the overcrowding and condition of the ""sand""...he was nice enought to say that he wouldn't bill our room, and advised us to check out the north shore.....So dont bother going to the beach....

The pool on the other hand was nice, for our size of family, and out needs. It has 3 small waddling pools, which my son loved! and was cleaned everyday! Small, yes, but did the job. One day, a staff member came out with frozen (but fresh) fruit for everyone in little plastic cups. They have lemon/lime water avasilable there, with disposable swim pampers for the little ones, and warm towels. I LOVED THE POOL!

The Spa.... We treated ourselves to couples package for a massage. We both went at different times beacuase we didnt want to leave our son. My husband loved it, and I didn't. I;m a regular for massages, and had better. At the time I was 6 months pregnant, and had the pregnancy massage. It was quiet akward. She talked to me the entire time, which i found nice at first, but I really just wanted to relax. Maybe it was because it was my first prenatal massage that I didnt enjoy it..But I was talked into these ""fabulous"" pregnancy products which had a nice scent. Now that I am using them, there is nothing special about them....When you are done, they kindly ask you, with a HUGE smile on your face, ""Is it alright if we add a 30% gratuity to your bill?"" Like really, who's going to say no? So on a $200 massage, your are tipping $60!  On the menu, it says that its a manditory fee....

One day my husband found a tylenol in my sons mouth while we were in our room. We dont use the stuff so it didnt belong to us. I called the front desk and advised them. She appologized, and later housekeeping came up to ""inspect"" the room and interview us. I let her know where he probably found it, and she wanted to come in and check the rest of the room. I advised that it wasnt required, and she agreed and left. But that was the end of that....Being an over protective mother, I just expected more of an appology, or something to make of for what could have been a really bad situation. After this incident, I really just couldn't wait to get to Maui....

So there it is. If money isn't an issue, stay here, but if you want to get your money's value, go somewhere else.","Date of stay: August 2011","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

I booked it because it was the #1 ranked hotel (in Honolulu) here on Trip Advisor and figured I would give it a shot. When I got there, I was a little disappointed. Don't get me wrong it's a very nice hotel with a great staff but there are some things that this hotel does not offer. First off, it's not even on the beach. You have have to exit the hotel and walk (about a block) to a public beach where you have to PAY for umbrellas and chairs. Some of the other high end hotels are right on the beach and offer chairs and umbrellas free of charge. 

The other issue is the pool. Both the pool and the pool ""deck"" are tiny. My first day there my wife and I wanted to go lay out by the pool and were sent away because there were no open chairs! We were disappointed and decided we would go to the beach instead. When we go to the beach we learned that the Trump International did not offer chairs and umbrellas... so we paid. Our second day there, we decided we would wake up early (in hopes of getting a chair) and head to the pool to get some well needed R&R. When we got there, there were about 20 kids in the pool and on the pool deck. They were screaming, splashing, running around, etc. it was mayhem. After about 10 minutes my wife and I couldn't deal with is so went up to our room and spent the rest of the morning there. I called the hotel to complain and was told that the Trump International was also a residence and that one of the owners rented the pool area for their child's birthday party. I wish I would have known... I would have gone elsewhere.

All that said, it is a very nice hotel with a great staff. But for the money... you can do better. Next time I will!!","Date of stay: September 2011","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

The hotel was great, the staff exceptional- they really made for a great stay- but I did expect more from the hotel itself. Upon check in the staff were very professional and friendly, check in was quick and they promptly phoned me when my room was ready. I was also upgraded to an Ocean View room (level 21 facing Diamond Head) which is always welcome! However the room itself was a lot smaller than expected, insufficient room for luggage (the narrow hall was an odd angle which didn't leave enough space for suit- case). The room whilst clean wasn't spotless. The room was  dusty particularly the side tables, lampshades and skirting/base boards- this was visible from a quick glance. The remote didn't work (again staff quickly addressed the issue), two lights in the bathroom were out.  On the positive: the kitchen facilities in the room were great (a fully stocked kitchen with a deep sink, microwave, toaster, stove top etc.) and rooms were serviced twice a day. The bed was THE most comfortable bed I have ever slept in and there were a choice of pillows available. As the hotel is only 2 years old, the furniture is modern and the balcony had a table with two chairs to take in the great views! On my first night in I ordered room service. The food was good but unfortunately had two hairs in it, and whilst sometimes this happens, I did not expect it from a hotel of this calibre. The attache service was flawless. Dennis was wonderful a real sweetie!  From beach-bags packed with water, fruit, towels and sunscreen, to directions on how to get places, what tours to book etc he was great!.  I used the gym most mornings and it was clean with a great range of modern treadmills,  cross trainers and bikes. The hotel's famous Mai Tai's did not disappoint one bit, make sure you try one!

More luxury and sophistication than tropical hoopla and discounts everywhere.  Very well maintained and staff that was friendly and very accommodating.  If you even slow down in the lobby someone is there asking if they can help you.  We had a one bedroom suite.  Suites were very nice and the kitchens are top notch and very well equipped.  It was nice to keep snacks and drinks in the fridge and have the stove and oven to cook a couple of breakfasts and snacks on.  Floor to ceiling glass everywhere made for excellent views of the ocean. We could view the Friday fireworks from our balcony while sipping drinks.  There are no stores within the hotel but the location is excellent for walking to almost anything so it isn't an issue.  We have never stayed in any hotel with beds as comfortable as these were.  Everyone from front desk staff to the security manager we met in the elevator asked what they could do for us to make our stay more enjoyable.  A request for extra coffee from housekeeping one morning brought me an entire pile of packets.  Received little food gifts every other night or so - champagne and chocolate covered strawberries for our anniversary, chocolates another night, popcorn and soda for our son.  Christopher in the bar area was a pleasure to see every time we went down.  He would make suggestions for their house special drinks to try and he was right every time.  Disappointments:  the pool is very small and spots that have sun are hard to get.  You have to sit in an area that is separated from the pool by a wall if you want to lay in the sun.  It was very crowded and full of children on our stay but that was just bad luck.  Apparently August is a big travel month for the Japanese and it was packed with families with lots of kids that took over the entire pool area running around and filling the already small pool with inflatable toys.  We had hoped for an upgrade in the room as we kept reading about people getting them but didn't happen. Again, probably because they appeared to be fully booked.  Would have been great as we had our teenage son with us and we sure could have used the extra bedroom.  The sofa bed was okay but not up to Four Seasons caliber.   Only complaint about our room was the shower.  The ""open"" concept they have is horrible.  No matter how hard you try to point the shower head against the back wall, you still end up with water all over the bathroom floor.  We had more than a few times where one of us nearly had a nasty spill on wet tile until we learned to just cover the floor with towels before we started.    If you are looking for a hotel with lots of Hawaiian decor and music playing, if you have kids that are noisy and need entertainment, if you are looking to be right on the beach rather than a short walk from it, this isn't for you. If you want a quiet hotel with top amenities and a well apportioned room, staff that are well trained and gracious, and the pool scene isn't important to you, this IS the place for you.   The beach on this end of Waikiki is less crowded than further towards Diamond Head.  We were even able to watch them filming a scene from Hawaii 5-0 and after we were tired of standing in the sun were able to view it from our balcony with binoculars.  Very interesting.  Location is right next to DeRussy park and the U.S. Army Museum (which is free).  Take advantage and visit the museum.  Their signature restaurant, BLT, was okay, but we preferred the restaurants over at the Halekulani across the street.  Their bar was really nice though.  Very relaxing seating areas.  Great friendly service (see Christopher above) and very tasty food.  Not much for kids to eat though, I'll warn you.  All in all, we would definitely come back to this hotel.  Other than the shower, it was all we could ask for.  Oh yes - one thing that really impressed us.  We had an evening flight out and were hoping for a little extension to the noon checkout.  Not only did they allow us a late check out, they let us keep the room all the way till we left at 6:30 that evening without charge.  We were able to enjoy a full day, shower and have a meal before having to head to the airport.","Date of stay: August 2011","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I made the reservation after reading the glowing reviews of previous guests and confirming that Donald Trump has no ownership interest in the property.

The hotel is new and beautiful.  Our room was laid out well, with a very large bathroom with a tub and open shower with no glass or shower curtain.  My wife, daughter and I stayed for a week in a studio unit on the 18th floor with a full ocean view (upgraded from partial view at check-in).  The kitchenette is handy, although with so many nearby food choices we didn't do much cooking.  We had a king bed with a queen sofa sleeper, which gave us plenty of sitting room when the sofa bed wasn't extended.

The staff is gracious.  Our housekeeper was wonderful, making sure to work around our lazy schedule.

A couple of (slight) negatives:  With the lanai door open, you're more likely to hear traffic noise than surf.  The swimming pool and deck area is very small.  If you're lucky enough to get a room on an upper floor on the northwest side of the hotel, Fort Derussy offers a very nice buffer between the Trump and the high rise hotels to the west.

The hotel is centrally located in an area friends tell me used to be Waikiki's skid row.  It's very clean now.  The beach is a short walk and the hotel concierge will pack up a beach bag with towels, bottled water and fresh fruit.  Buses to the airport, Ala Moana Center and Pearl Harbor stop near the hotel.  The bus to Hanauma Bay runs on Kuhio Street, which is about a 10 minute walk.

There are a number of restaurants within a few blocks-- everything from Denny's to Roy's.  And, of course, there are about three ABC stores within spitting distance.

We saw very few fellow Americans during our stay at the Trump.  The majority of guests appeared to be Japanese, which gave the hotel a very nice international feel.  The Trump name might be popular in Japan because they don't understand him when he speaks.","Date of stay: September 2011","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The room itself was to die for.  We had been upgraded (for free!) and the room was so massive at first we couldn't find the bedroom it was so huge!  Our room even had 3 big screen TV's in it!

Service and cleanliness have no faults, and because it's so new it's all very fresh- unlike most of the other older hotels in the area. Infinity pool is great except in previous years bottled water was free at the pool which was not the case this year! Nice views especially on the side that looks out over the park to the beach. 
Make sure you head to the restaurant BLT downstairs, great steaks and burgers. It is a block back from the beach but the pool is good enough that you don't feel like you're missing out. Plus it's a 30 second walk across the road to the beach anyway.
Beautiful hotel, great service, large rooms with a good little kitchen - rooms much bigger than the halekulani across the road where we also stayed, however the halekulani has beach front so we stay at both to get the best of both worlds. Definitely the newest and nicest hotel we've stayed in in Waikiki.","Date of stay: July 2011","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The service was second-to-none. I can see why this hotel is #1 on Trip Advisor.

From check-in to check-out, the service and quality were amazing. Every member of the staff was so attentive, even during busy times at the front desk.

Our favourite parts: 1) Complimentary insulated beach bags with towels, water, sun screen and fruit. It's not much, but it certainly speaks volumes when a hotel works this hard to keep their clients from getting dehydrated or sun burnt. 2) Gourmet kitchen appliances in our room meant we could prepare our own meals when we were too tired to go out. 3) Short walk to the beach with option to rent lounges and umbrellas. Very handy when the sun is strong. 4) Hospitality suite provided when we required a late check-out due to our flight time. The room was just as amazing as our original.

(Yes, the pool is quite small but we didn't need it much anyway. We were always at a different beach for every day of the week)

Wife and I had a wedding to attend at the Halekulani Hotel across the street. Originally, we planed to stay there but could not find available rooms. So, we decided to stay at Trump Waikiki instead.

In the end, this was the better choice all along. First class service and rooms. As a local resident, I like the convenience of this location being on the corner of Saratoga and Kalia, without having to venture in the heart of Waikiki. Beach access is across the street and the shops & dining of Beachwalk and Royal Hawaiian SC is less than a 5-10 minute walk.

The only negatives comments I have on this property is the Porte Cochere is relatively small. We checked-in when there was a fashion show going on at the pool and the entrance was an absolute zoo...Also on Sunday morning (8/28 7:15 am) when returning to the property, the Bell Captain and Concierge on duty, failed to acknowledge me when I parked right in front of their desk. They were having a conversation, but believe me, it wasn't work related.  After about 5 minutes standing in front of them, the Bell Captain lifts his head up from the conversation and finally realizes I am standing there...

Overall, my wife & I were very pleased with our stay and would definitely return, when we have another event in Waikiki.","Date of stay: August 2011","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Divine duvet!  Suggestion for powdery beach.","Stayed two nights in a partial ocean view studio with no complaints, just suggestions.  Agree with previous reviewers that service is exceptional.  The kitchen was really nice but did not really use except the fridge for drinks and fruit.  Now the bed was so comfortable!  It was a fluffy futon or there must have been a pillow top mattress cover or something.  The duvet was divine and SO fluffy!  The suggestions are to have a few more hooks in the bathroom to hang clothes while changing or for toiletry bags.  And to have a another chair or two in the studio.  My son slept on the pull out so you can only sit on the beds if the sofa is pulled out which means only one chair with a back is available.  The room faced the sunset and the Hilton Hawaiian Village so could have probably viewed the fireworks from the lanai if we had stayed on a Friday night.  The beach immediately across the street was a bit rocky.  Walk in the direction of Duke's Lane to the area in front of Kealohilani ave. (about 7 blocks) and there is an area of beach with a wall that quiets the waves for young children and the sand is powdery.","Date of stay: August 2011","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Even though the hotel was close to full capacity, it did not fall short in any respect - every single person I've encountered , anywhere at the hotel, greeted me with a big smile on their face and went out of their way to ensure that my stay was as comfortable, smooth and luxurious as it could have been under any circumstance.

I have been going to Honolulu on a regular basis for some time, and I've always stayed at The Royal Hawaiian (before and after their recent renovation).  It was a difficult decision for me to switch over to Trump as one of the reasons The Royal Hawaiian remained attractive to me was their enclosed ""private beach"" with the chairs, umbrella and towel service.  After all, you go to Hawaii for the beach.  Trump is very close to the beach, but not ""ocean front"" and it does not have its own beach area.  However, I concluded fairly early during my stay that I'd chose Trump over The Royal Hawaiian any day because the beach is sooo close to the hotel, you are not restricted to one area, Trump gives you this wonderful beach tote with cold water, fruit, sunscreen and towel, and you can simply take off with your beach tote and wander around the beach, looking for your perfect spot.  You can easily rent an umbrella on the beach.  Also, because the Trump is not right on the ocean, the rooms are dry, mold-free and pristine (which tends to be a problem at other ocean front hotels) which made a world of difference to me as someone who suffers from severe allergies.

And for the room – it was dreamy.  My one-bedroom suite faced the beautiful ocean and provided a perfect setting for view of the sunset every single night and for the Hilton Village fireworks on Friday night (not to mention the beautiful beach view during the day).  The room came with a full-service kitchen with modern appliances, and every single item was kept in almost brand-new condition.  The deep tub provided a nice haven at the end of the day with the Trump bath amenities.  And of course, the washer/dryer - it makes a huge difference to have one in your room when you are away from home more than a couple of nights, especially when you are on a beach vacation - it was like living in someone's luxury condo - but with the exceptional service that only a 5 star hotel can provide.

And the bed and the fluffy pillows and the softest sheets – falling asleep and waking up was one of the most luxurious moments during my stay.

Housekeeping was superb - my room was cleaned by the time I got back from breakfast - it was as if they knew the moment I left my room and made sure that my room had been attended to by the time I was back.  A few other times I asked for something extra from housekeeping, someone showed up within 5 minutes with a big smile on his/her face.

The pool may not be big or special, but it does provide a serene place to chill when you do not feel like going over to the beach (which was crowded) - and every drink (alcoholic or non) on their pool menu is delicious and refreshing.   The pool is sizeable enough for kids to play in and yet is beautifully designed with its infinity feature for adults to appreciate.  It is not for people who would want to hang out by the pool all day long, every day – but then again, you are in Hawaii – why would you do that?

Whenever I got back to the hotel with whole bunch of shopping bags or my scuba gear, one of the bell boys would come running to me to help me.

I also had a massage at the Trump Spa – the massage was one of the best massages I've had – as someone who gets a massage every 2 weeks in Los Angeles, that’s quite a statement.

And all the treats the housekeeping would leave on my bed - especially the Trump chocolates - they were divine.

When I was ready to check out, I called the Bell Captain to send someone up to my room to get my luggage.  By the time I’d checked out and gone to the ground floor (Lobby is on a higher floor), a cab was waiting for me with my luggage, ready to take me to the airport.

To sum it up, when a hotel stands for a big name like Trump - a formidable figure who is very ""current"" and who epitomizes luxury and perfection – it has to step up, and in my opinion, it truly has.   I am going to return to Trump Waikiki on my future trips to Honolulu without any hesitation.

The disappointing parts, however, are: i) elevators are very busy and you always have to wait for several minutes before getting one ii) the swimming pool is simply a joke (small and full of children) iii) the bar has a last order at 10pm!!!! iv) the spa is small and basic and I would not suggest to visit it if not for the therapist that are very good and professional v) overall the place lacks of luxury and is very expensive for what you get.

The room was lovely with a fantastic bed and bathroom.  The Ocean view is across two roads, a park and at an angle so isn't really worth paying extra for.  Service when we checked in was exceptional, very friendly and we felt very well treated.  However, check out was a slight nightmare partly due to the number of people checking out but also there weren't enough staff on.  We waited over 10 minutes for the lift and then waited again to check out, this caused a little bit of stress as we had a taxi booked.

The pool is nice but is a narrow, although long, infinity spa pool so don't expect too much - it is how it looks on the photos and won't be suitable if you have kids.  There was also a bit of confusion when we ordered extra coffee for the room and were brought the wrong thing.

It was a magnificent vacation! Beginning with our arrival at the hotel we were greeted with leis. Then we were upgraded to a corner one bedroom suite with two balconies. We had a great view of both the ocean and city. The room itself was beautiful. The kitchen is fully stocked with every appliance and tool that you can imagine, including a rice cooker! There is also a washer and dryer, which really came in handy. The first night we were even given a bottle of champagne to celebrate our honeymoon.

All of the staff was extremely friendly and eager to please. The concierge desk was very helpful with booking outings and providing bags for the beach that include towels, water, fruit, and sunscreen. 

The restaurant on the lobby level was also very nice. We had lunch and drinks there and the ambiance and view was wonderful. The mai tais are highly recommended.

No, the hotel is not on the beach, but the beach is just a short walk away. It is also well situated to use public transportation. The pool is on the lobby level so you get a very nice city view. The pool has more of an urban hotel feel rather than beach feel, so it may not be as suitable for children.

The only downside to the hotel was housekeeping. They did a less than superb job cleaning. The day we arrived, we discovered broken glass fragments on the kitchen floor. Also, I noticed that dishes that they washed still had remnants of food left on them. Sand on our bathroom floor was not cleaned either.

As usual with these sort of hotels, there is a online concierge questionnaire which enquires about needs etc and if travelling with children.  We were, 2 infact (8 and 5yr). On arrival we were nicely greeted and the children were certainly made to feel special. At reception as we were signing in, ice water with melon infusion was brought out with towel to freshen up for all. The staff were always helpful and courteous. Never really felt the pressure to tip for everything... but I have to say the service was indeed very good and any gratuity they received was deserved.  The rooms are exactly as portrayed in the photos and the lounge and dining area are spacious and tastefully furnished. The views were indeed ocean view especially so from the living area and master bed. Superb. There was a small balcony which we did not really use. The kitchen was well equipped. Washer/dryer of course important for children. Oh on the first day, children both received a soft toy, drawing and coloring book and also 4 stylish ""shots"" of juices and milkshake for their arrival in the room when we got there. Very thoughtful to our daily stay.  Gourmet cookies as well. Other days of room service, chocolates etc was also left. My only complain was that they tended to have these very horribly tea infusion thing, and left very few plain black teabags. Nevertheless, room service fixed that when called.   They have the usual Wii available when asked for (ie we were informed of the available entertainments for children) in a ""menu"" on arrival. Asked for a Wii and they came and set up the unit for you. Kept the kids happy.  The rooms cannot be fault. Free high speed Wifi.

The hotel had a small pool which is not really suitable for children (4 ft deep) and that was really their only weak point. But when you have the ocean, well let's say we were mostly at the beach. The location is good, right in the centre of Waikiki, numerous convenient store nearby, close to the beach. It is literally one block back from the beach. If you walk a bit up the beach it becomes less rough and more suitable for children. They do provide a simple day beach bag... ie towels and sunscreen as well as water, which is great. At the end of your day, just hand it back!  Being in the centre, you are surrounded by restaurants, take you pick. Roy's was pretty good.

All in all, a lovely place, superb apartments (they are listed on the market for about 2 to 2.5 million, if you fancy buying one) and we would definitely stay there again. It is however not for those who really must have a big pool or must have a pool for small children during their stay.","Date of stay: May 2011","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Also stayed at the Hyatt which was half the price - and quite seriously if I was doing it over I probably just would of stayed at the Hyatt as the Trump is expensive for what was a hotel or apartment type hotel.

From check-in to check-out the service was superb but I would stress that this is a hotel geared for couples and groups of adults, rather than families with young kids.

The design of the pool looks fantastic but is long and thin and not geared up for kids to be splashing around. The space around the pool is also very limited and once again designed for adults to relax rather than for kids to run around.

We stayed in a deluxe ocean view studio on the 20th floor with incredible views (Room 2017), which overlooked the ocean on one side and the mountains on the other. I highly recommended requesting this room or 2117, 2217 or 2317.

The room was tastefully decorated and featured a small living area with a large flat screen TV and also an iPod dock.

When booking, I deliberated whether to upgrade to a one bedroom but the studios are so spacious I'm glad I didn't spend the extra money.

Our balcony provided us with a front row seat for the Friday night fireworks, which was a lovely experience after a long flight from Sydney.

The well equipped kitchen is a fantastic bonus and by stocking up on breakfast things at the ABC store around the corner, we enjoyed breakfast on our balcony each morning and bypassed the expensive room service and cafe crowds.

The king size bed was very comfortable (we named it 'the cloud') and there is a pillow menu if you are not happy with the selection on the bed.

The spacious modern bathroom includes a large shower, deep bath and double sinks.

Even though the hotel is one street back from the beach, it really doesn't make any difference because you have the lovely ocean views from your balcony and the walk to the beach is literally a couple of minutes. When heading to the beach, ask the Concierge for a complimentary Trump beach bag, which includes swimming towels, cold water and fresh fruit - a lovely touch!

We didn't eat at the hotel (although I'm sure it would be excellent) but we did have dinner at Nobu (okay service, great food but expensive - over US$400 for 2 people), which is a 5 min walk from the hotel and Orchid's at the Halekulani Hotel (also a 5 min walk), which was also very nice. We also had dinner at Dukes (a Waikiki institution), which was a lot of fun. The hotel is more than happy to make bookings and we had fantastic tables at all 3 restaurants.

Depending on how long you are going to be staying in Waikiki, I would recommend hiring a car for a couple of days and driving to Pearl Habour and then onto the Waikele Premium Factory Outlets (15 min drive on from Pearl Harbour) and then on the second day head up to the North Shore (and the famous Sunset Beach aka Pipeline). We hired a convertible Mustang through www.discounthawaiicarrental.com, which was great fun!

After our time in Waikiki, we headed over to Maui for a week and only wish Trump would open a hotel on that island, as they are crying out for a luxury, small leading hotel in the Lahaina area.

Thank you to the team at Trump for making our holiday so enjoyable and for also making our 10th Anniversary so memorable (the sparkling wine was greatly appreciated!).

We highly recommend this hotel - especially for couples.","Date of stay: July 2011","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Check- in: We arrived at 11 am and were greeted warmly by the head porter and his team and escorted to the lobby on the 6th flr. The staff were very welcoming with leis and coconut infused water while we checked in. As we'd requested an early check in we were happy to wait 20 minutes in the outdoor bar area while our suite was prepared. 

Suite: our rooms ( 2 bed plus den) were on the 24th flr with a partial ocean view/city view. Immediate impression of the suite was of spaciousness and cleanliness. Great fully stocked kitchen along with dining table and chairs. The lounge consisted of a large couch and armchairs and large flatscreen tv and coffee table and was adjacent to the main balcony (lanai). The den was a small alcove separated from the lounge area by the dining table and chairs and consisted of a large couch (that doubled as a fold out bed) and a chest of drawers. The main bedroom had a separate toilet, walk in robe, and large shower with a separate huge bath tub. The second bedroom was smaller but offered a private balcony (lanai) and a decent sized bathroom (shower only and toilet). Off the entrance was the laundry (washer and dryer) and third bathroom consisting of a shower and toilet. This was the smallest bathroom but still a good size. All bathrooms were stocked with the Spa at Trump branded toiletries including body wash, body lotion, shampoo, conditioner, scrub, shower cap, mouthwash and facial soap. These toiletries were excellent quality. 

The beds were sooooo comfortable with fresh crisp white linen sheets and great pillows. We utilised the fold out couch in the den and this too was comfortable (not as comfortable and soft as the bed, but definitely better than the standard fold out experience). We liked the nightly turn down service and the attention the housekeeping staff took to lay out the robes and slippers and prepare our beds. We found every day that either bottles of water or chocolates were left in our suite by housekeeping which offered a nice touch. 
We also appreciated the very nice bottle of complimentary champagne left in our suite as a birthday gift from management. 

Service: overall we found the service to be excellent, in particular the concierge and the staff at the Wai'olu ocean view lounge restaurant on the 6th floor. We dined there a couple of times and really took a liking to the mai tais! Michael and Christopher were great wait staff and provided us with lots of suggestions about sights and attractions to check out during our stay. Happy hour is from 4-6 pm daily and although the mai tais aren't included in happy hour prices, there is an excellent vodka cocktail to enjoy instead called Stars on the Water. Mmmmm. 

Restaurants: we had dinner at both the Wai'olu ocean view lounge and the BLT on the ground floor. Food and service at both were excellent. We were given a complimentary birthday dessert at the Wai'olu when the wait staff heard we were celebrating our birthdays. 

Facilities: we used the gym a few times which had treadmills, bikes and free weights together with a couple of weight machines. There are headphones available to use with the treadmills and bikes and filtered water. The gym is quite small though (only 2 bikes) and could get crowded. 

Other: the only downside of staying in our beautiful suite was the daily battle to open the sliding door to the main balcony off the lounge area. This was a heavy glass door that took some effort to open and close each time. 
Another issue came when one of my friends, sleeping in the second bedroom, wanted to sleep with her balcony door open so she could enjoy the sound of the surf. However as we found out the next morning, if either balcony door is left open, the airconditioning for the entire suite switches off, and we had to get housekeeping to get it working again. The evening turn down service was inconsistent and a couple of times we had to call to ask for this service.
Also the pool size - as noted by other reviewers- is very small. Its a beautiful infinity pool on the 6th floor but the small size means it gets crowded very quickly. 

Location: the beach is a very quick walk from the Trump, less than 5 minutes. We found the location perfect as it was near the beach and main shopping area. Around the corner is an ABC store to stock up on food and drink. We jumped in a cab to the Ala Moana shopping center to get most of our groceries at the supermarket there. We felt very safe and comfortable walking to and from the Trump late at night as the area is well lit and populated. 

Suggestions: grab the beach bags (available from the concierge desk on the ground floor) when heading to the beach. The bags come with towels, fruit and bottled water. 
We emailed the Trump prior to arriving to request some advice about activities and restaurants and were sent a detailed list of suggestions which came in handy when planning what to do each day. We also spoke with the concierge who made all our bookings for us and offered more ideas.","Date of stay: July 2011","Trip type: Traveled with friends","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

The room (3 bedroom) was beautiful with beautiful bathrooms and the most comfortable beds ever (and I mean EVER).  Even though the rooms were large, clean, and high-end, the service was even better.  The people who work here, without exception are genuinely nice.  They go out of their way to help.  The complementary beach bags they provide daily are invaluable.  Yes it costs 28 dollars to park ...but the valet service is great and saves time and work.  If parking is ever worth 28 dollars a day then it is here.  We had my whole family (three daughters and sons-in-law) with us and everyone was impressed and would return in a heartbeat.  Having been there, I can think of no other place to stay in Honolulu than at the Trump International.  Other guests on this site have talked about noise ...never heard another soul (stayed 5 nights).  Also other guests have complained about the wireless internet being slow...are you kidding me...it was excellent.  The walk to the beach was extremely short.  Some construction across the street but starts after 9 and ends by 5.  But again the staff are the stars at this all-star property.

We were upgraded to a large one-bedroom ocean view suite upon check-in.  The room finishes and features were exceptional and worthy of a 5-star hotel. Unfortunately, the suite was on a lower floor, which can make for lots of noise at night in any hotel in Waikiki's concrete hotel canyons.  The hotel is one block from the beach overlooking Fort Derussy Park.  You can see the beach, but you can't hear the waves, which is always disappointing in Hawaii.  If there was anything that struck me about this property it is that the resort facilities are somewhat small and lacking in features.  The gym is very small and does not have a sauna.  The roof top infinity pool is a modest affair on the fifth floor with not much room for sunning--a major drawback for a non-beach front hotel.  The food at the hotel's two restaurants was pretty average and the breakfast buffet was, again, small, and lacking in variety.  Overall, we had a lovely experience, but at these prices, you expect more, particularly when compared to the hotels across the street.  For slightly more money, you could go with the Halekulani and be assured of a 5-star experience or save a significant amount of money and stay at the Outrigger Reef for a better location and larger guest facilities.  In the end, the Trump's elegant and spacious rooms are some of the best I've encountered in traveling,but how much time will you actually spend in them when you come to Hawaii?","Date of stay: July 2011","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Because of all the rave reviews on Tripadvisor, I wanted to check out the hotel for myself and possibly book a group rate for my wedding guests next year.  Here are my comments on the stay:

Welcome: Upon arrival, you are given nice shell leis, a cold towel, and a glass of fruit-infused cold water.  The very friendly staff will walk you up to the 6th floor lobby for check in.  Walking into our air conditioned room with Hawaiian music on, we were greeted by a tray of chocolate-covered strawberries and two cold waters in the fridge.

Upgrades: Although I heard that you can usually get upgraded at check-in, this didn't happen for us.  No harm though since that would have just been an added bonus.  

Parking: Valet parking is $28/night.  I always called down for my car before leaving my room, and it was usually waiting for us when we came down.  When picking up your car in the morning, your car will always be supplied with cold bottled water - a very nice detail.  The driveway did get quite busy during the day and you sometimes had to wait for shuttle buses, limos, or other cars to move before you could get out.  

Room: The rooms are wonderful at the Trump.  I did a site inspection for my wedding and visited most of the room categories.  Every room is very spacious and has a kitchenette or full kitchen (based on the size).  For larger groups, the 1bdrm + den (sleeps 6; 1.5 bath), 2 bdrm (sleeps 6; 2.5 bath), and 2 bdrm + den (sleeps 8; 2.5 bath) are really great value and they won't charge you for the additional guests.  The studio city view room was smaller than our partial ocean view room and both didn't include lanais.  Our room - and all rooms on the south side - directly face the Outrigger Hotel next door whose guests like to hang out on their patios.  Make sure to close your curtains if you want privacy!!  I do also wish that the view would be more direct on the ocean, but since the hotel is not on the beach and blocked by the hotels around it, you only see a diagonal view.

Housekeeping: Service in this area is great.  Our room was always kept very clean and tidy with housekeeping and nightly turn down service.  They even wash all of your dishes for you.  They also replace used towels and clean during turn down service as well so it is like getting your room cleaned twice a day.

Dining - Breakfast: Like any hotel breakfast, it's not that cheap ($60 for two).  The view consists of mostly the pool below it and the Outrigger Hotel next door.  One qualm is that we arrived at 8am when it was empty except for 1 other table.  When we were seated at a 2-top, we asked to be moved to the 4-top next to us since it was in the shade and had a nicer view.  Despite the restaurant being practically empty, she refused to allow us to move and ""preferred"" that we stay at our table.  Bad service? I think so.  When we left, 80% of the tables (including the one next to us) were still empty.  Also beware that there were ants crawling on our table - a downside of being in a tropical location.

Dining - Room Service:  There is nothing bad I can say about room service.  It was exceptional.  They charge a $4 delivery fee plus an automatic 18% gratuity, which is pretty reasonable compared to other hotels I've been to.  We ordered dinner in on a Saturday night, and it arrived within 20 minutes.  The portion size was much bigger than I expected, and the quality and taste of food was superb.  Every day during my trip, I went to food tastings from top caterers on the island, and none of them satisfied me like my Trump room service dinner.  

Front Desk: The staff at the front desk is ok - definitely not the best I've experienced.  They are simply put - adequate.  In my opinion, they are polite, but not genuinely friendly and always seemed so busy even when there were no guests at the desk.  Although we're paying $400 a night, when I asked them to post one postcard, they asked for my room number and charged me 40 cents for the postage.  40 cents? You can't comp that?! I have never been charged at other hotels in the same class as Trump.  

When problems arise: On the 3rd morning of our stay, our room wasn't getting any cold or warm water.  The water was SCORCHING hot even though the hot water wasn't on at all.  We had an exceptionally busy day, and when we called the front desk at 6am, they said their plumber wouldn't be in until 7am but they could give us a room across the hall where we could either shower or to move to completely.  The room ""across the hall"" ended up being on the other side of the BUILDING.  And despite this being the hotel's problem and a potential liability, they moved us to a smaller city view room - a DOWNGRADE.  We didn't have time to move all of our stuff having being delayed now 2 hours so we carried our shower supplies in our bathrobes across the building to shower.  That night, the problem seemed to have been solved.  However, we didn't receive any followup to say what happened, no apologies, no compensation, NOTHING - only a downgraded hotel room and a dorm room experience for $400 a night.

If you are lucky enough to have a problem-free room, this is a really amazing hotel to stay in Waikiki away from all of the noise and hustle of the ""strip"".","Date of stay: July 2011","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

The Trump Waikiki property is simply superb.  They take hospitality, service and quality to the highest level.  We stayed for a week in a one-bedroom, plus den, suite at the Trump.  What is really amazing to me is that each and every client facing individual at the hotel has been trained exceptionally well.  Professional doesn't describe the service level at this hotel.  Aloha doesn't describe the spirit of the service well enough.  It's just perfect.  Every interaction with every person is done with a positive, service oriented approach, it's really hard to imagine so many people can be so nice, helpful, polite and friendly each and every day.  I've stayed at A LOT of hotels, and nice ones at that, and haven't seen this service level before.  If you want impecable service, you've got to stay here.  

Next, the quality of the rooms, the furnishings, the kitchen, the bed-everything is top of the line.  We loved the gourmet kitchen.  While we only had 3 meals at the hotel, each was fantastic.  High quality food, great taste with exellent presentation.  The bar is also great for evening cocktails and they have a very inventive drink menu.  

Lastly, I want to address the pool because that gets a lot of negative comments.  This isn't the hotel you come to and plan on staying by the pool each day with all of your kids in tow.  The pool here is sophisticated, luxurious and fits perfectly into the environment this property creates.  If you want an elegant pool to spend some quiet time away from the beach, this is it.  The view from the pool is terrific and the infinity style fits in perfectly.  

This hotel has syle and creates a unique environment and culture.  I don't think this hotel is for everyone, frankly.  But if you appreciate a luxurious enviornment with top of the line food and beverage all wrapped by the best service staff in the country, then you'll love this property.","Date of stay: July 2011","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We've also stayed at the Grand Waikikian (part of the Hilton Village) which was good too and probably more suitable for kids given the number of pools (Trump pool is pretty small comparatively) but the room at the Trump is nicer.
Our only issue was that there was drilling for a few hours when we first arrived during the day but we received a letter of apology from reception upon enquiring about it.  Oh and don't order room service.  We needed two glasses of milk for our daughter and it cost us $19!!!","Date of stay: June 2011","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Found that place because of the high rankings in tripadvisor. The place was excellent in every way.

We had booked one bedroom Ocean view suite, but we were upgraded to double bedroom ocean view suite. This place was huge, 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, fully equipped kitchen with every item you might need available. Bed quality, bed linens, bathrobes everything was brilliant and new in mint condition. Another nice touch by Trump - Free high speed Internet ! Great

We had some a la carte breakfast which was expensive but perfect. I have to recommend the Kamehameha eggs with king crab.

We had 2 times dinner at the BLT steakhouse in the hotel. Probably one of the best Porterhouse steaks you are going to get in US (beat some big time Vegas steakhouses as meat)

You get free water and towels if you want to go to the beach, although we went to North shore for better beaches than Waikiki.

After reading the reviews on trip advisor we had high hopes, but remained realistic to avoid disappointment...turns out we didnt need too! From the moment we walked in it met our expectations!
As i said we read trip advisor before we went, one review advised parking in the car park opposite the hotel as its much cheaper than the hotel parking..turns out its not. Our advice use the Valet parking trump offers it's around $24 overnight, the one opposite is $36..and you don't get the service trump offers - door to door service, water bottles in your car when you get it back, great advice and directions from the valet guys - all of whom were great. 
We were upgraded to one of the suites, which was huge, it was by far the best equipped hotel room we've stayed in. kitchen had everything toaster, kettle, dishes, blender, coffee maker - even a cup cake tray in case you felt like baking! 
Bathrooms and rooms were clean and modern - housekeeping were great, nothing was too much trouble, which can be said of all the staff, which i think is what made the stay great.

The concierge desk was great, we stayed at four hotels during our honeymoon, and asked at all the hotels about things to see and do, Trump by far were the most helpful..rather than just handing you a bunch of leaflets in a half hearted way, they actually give proper advice and talk you through the best way to get the most out of the attraction/site you are visiting. 

Everyone who worked at the hotel went out of their way and actually seemed happy to help, which can not be said any other hotel i have stayed in. Would definitely recommend this hotel.","Date of stay: June 2011","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

It is a beautiful hotel with great rooms, awesome views from the restaurant, and a nice way to see Waikiki in a short time. We were on our way to Kauai (which ended up being more our speed) but we were glad we could see a bit of Waikiki on our way there. While we probably could have been to some of the great restaurants in the city we were content not to have to figure out logistics (parking reservations etc) after flying in from the East coast (right after our wedding). We had a late lunch and later drinks at the hotel grillle. The open air style with couches around square tables was a perfect way to view the beach and the city while relaxing. We took advantage of the complimentary beach bag rentals with towels to go hang out on the beach at night (it is about a 1 block walk from the hotel). Glad we did it but it was still a little crowded for us even at night (the beach there was right in front of open air restaurants).

Only noise came from street level which you can still hear 25 floors up, but is very minimal.  Very infant/ toddler friendly - the hotel provided a crib, baby monitor, some baby wipes, and a pack of Johnson & Johnson baby products.  Pricey but worth every penny, IMHO.  One other thing, there are two types of 3BR suites.  The one we opted for has a full bath in each BR plus a half bath.  In the other 3BR suite, two BRs share a bathroom.

Despite only staying two nights, we were upgraded to a one-bedroom suite and given a bottle of bubbly to celebrate our anniversary.  

While this suite was on a lower floor and noisy street traffic was right below as a result, we loved the huge room and amenities.  The kitchen and bathrooms were stunning, marble, granite and top of the line appliances.  The design is really clean, elegant and warm.  The bathroom soaps and scrubs, etc. were borderline overkill but so much fun.  The bed was just heaven.  The property itself is modern Hawaiian, which is a nice change from the bamboo overkill elsewhere.  

Service was spot on.  We arrived, got water, chilled towels, unique lei's.  We were jetlagged the next morning and got up at 4am.  Despite room service not starting till 6, they were happy to send up breakfast for us at 5am and recommendations on the best type of tropical syrup for our pancakes.  (We are novices past maple).

The concierge was very helpful in arranging last minute transportation to Pearl Harbor and the airport.  We didn't use but noticed really neat baskets they give beachgoers to use.  They basically have thought of everything.

I had a pineapple scrub and massage at the spa.  It almost put me to sleep and was very much needed after our 9-hour flight the previous day.  The spa is very small and does not have a locker room, which was its only drawback.  This does however make you feel like you have the entire spas undivided attention.

From the welcome Lei on arrival to the cold lemon water refreshment when checking in to the beach bags when going swimming, the complimentry water bottles, the turn down service and the extremely friendly staff whether they be inside, outside, this place was WOW.  The bath in the bathroom is the deepest bath ever, the amenities good size so you don't run out every day and the room spotless.  If I was being really picky and this is really scratching for something to complain about - they need to put a extra towel rail up in the bathroom. We had a studio ocean view - so don't know if other rooms were different but there was only one small towel rail above the toilet, which would not really accomodate two huge towels........but as I say - just been picky.  The view from not only the balcony but the bed was amazing..... Note: to NZ's (as I saw a note to OZ'ies saying their leis would be confiscated if declared), we declared ours to NZ customs and were fine to bring back in to NZ, they were just to nice not to bring home as a sourvenier, although they are shell they had been sealed so NZ MAF where fine with that......so declare to be safe.

Pros:
- We booked the 4 nights and got a 5th one free through their promotions. We reserved a one bedroom studio oceanview room. We had read that sometimes guests are upgraded at check-in, but we figured with this promotion that wouldn't happen and we were quite happy with what we booked. However, upon check-in, we were very pleasantly surprised to find that they DID upgrade us to a one-bedroom suite with a den. That came with a full kitchen, giant laundry room, full bath (bathtub & shower), another bathroom with a shower, living room, and den, plus of course the master bedroom. It was seriously nicer than our house! So thanks, Trump :)

- We were also greeted with champagne up at our room. Excellent touch!

- Our view was beautiful. As we settled in, we caught the sunset from our suite and it was just lovely.

- Bed was divine! It was hard to tear yourself away in the morning to go sight-seeing!

- Bathtub was also divine. Two people fit in there quite well ;-)

- Service was exceptional! Especially Dennis at the concierge. He was so helpful and patient in providing us maps and directions since our GPS in the rental car failed us. 

Cons:
- Valet parking prices are unreal. Luckily we had read from another reviewer on here (so I shall pass it on to you!) to park literally across the street at the Hale Koa's parking lot. We got a daily rate that overall through the week saved us around $100 or more. It was even better to have our car so accessible (I mean REALLY across the street) without having to wait for valet or tip or anything.

- Noise was kind of rough with traffic and buses and whatnot outside, but only if you have your lanai doors open. And really, if you want peace and quiet you probably shouldn't stay in Oahu, let alone Waikiki. So that wasn't so much of a big deal. 

- Friday nights for the Hilton fireworks we had hoped to grab a seat on the terrace at the bar, but that filled up pretty fast apparently so we had to settle for seats toward the back. If this is your plan, get there early and enjoy some cocktails! My husband had a delicious mai tai while I had a bellini. 

So all in all, I am VERY pleased we came here. They treated us very very well and it was an excellent start to our honeymoon!","Date of stay: May 2011","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Our 2-bed with den apartment was perfect for three adults and a 4 y.o. enabling us to prepare our own breakfasts, lunches and snacks.  We liked the evening tidy-up rarely offered these days.  We liked the quietness of the hotel, resulting I guess because their steak restaurant is accessible only from the street, the bar/dining with its lovely view is relatively small and spaciously laid out and few people patronised the breakfast buffet. The latter is a non-event with no view and, amazing for a quality hotel, a very limited selection.  However we probably would not have used the breakfast buffet anyway.  Once we took ourselves to the marvellous Halekulani Hotel breakfast buffet right opposite us.  The result of these limited dining opportunities was that outsiders did not frequent the hotel, giving that quiet, exclusive feel.  The pool area often was very windy unfortunately.  However the quietness and excellent layout of the pool with its hot tub, children’s areas and wet edge was ideal for the small numbers that frequented it.

To sum up, the service, the quietness, the quality and size of the apartment, attention to detail, were all winners for us.  We were very glad we were NOT ocean-front with its noise and masses of people.  I used to stay at the Sheraton – what a high-traffic-area it is these days!","Date of stay: May 2011","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Lives up to expectations!","We stayed at the Trump Tower May 10, 2011 to May 17th. We were in Honolulu for a conference and leisure. We stayed on the 23rd floor in a partial ocean view suite. I highly recommend this option! The room is modern, well furnished, huge, with a separate full kitchen, washer/dryer, living room and spacious bathroom, balcony, 2 flat screen TVs. Turn down service was thoughtful and included chocolates and AM service requests (for extra coffee, laundry detergents, etc) were met consistently and with enthusiasm. 
I highly recommend the suite over equivalent and cheaper traditional room alternatives in the area.
Reasons: 1) you will save a lot of money by cooking occasionally and being able to keep left overs ( there is a grocery store about 15minutes from trump tower with a red box rental) 2) you will have a greatly added convenience of being able to do laundry which for daily trips to the beach, active outings will be very useful as temperature is generally 80 degrees both day and night.
TIPS
Check out Diamond head and do the 1 hour vigorous hike to the top. View is worth it. 
There is a wonderful happy hour which I recommend for drinks and appetizer.
The infinity pool is beautiful but NOT great for kids as it is narrow and has sharp edges.
Beach bags given by front desk include sun screen, towels, snack.
The Discover Hawaii tour is fantastic, especially the tour of the north shore and well worth the 70$ a person.
taking the bus is a much cheaper alternative to taxis and easy to navigate.","Date of stay: May 2011","Trip type: Traveled on business","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Other members of our family had a one bedroom suite with a den on the 11th floor. 

Upon arrival we were given beautiful leis (black tree nuts for men, white shells for women). For the Aussies reading this, to note is that if you declare the lais to Customs upon arrival, they will be confiscated. We were also given cold towels and check-in was completed quickly and efficiently. 

Our suite was clean and neat and we appreciated the welcoming plate of brownies and bottled water. Also supplied were sachets of premium coffee and a bag of ground coffee with a little pot of Hawaiian pineapple sugar. The air conditioning was set to arctic, so we turned it down (up?).

The view from the balcony off the living room was spectacular. It was spoiled a little by the fantastic view into the rooms of the Halekulani hotel right across the road (which also blocked out most of our central ocean view) but hey, this is Waikiki and the Trump Towers is smack in the middle of one of the most built-up areas. 

The full kitchen was beautifully appointed and very well equipped. There was even a wine fridge. There were stools for eating at the kitchen bench but also a round glass-topped table and four chairs for meals. There was an under-bench dishwasher and a washer and dryer in a cupboard in the hall right alongside. The living area had a large flat screen TV, coffee table, writing desk, chair and comfy couches. The spaces were small but functional. 

The bedroom was... cosy. The drawers in the lowboy (atop which sat another flat screen TV) were ridiculously shallow and a source of  frustration as things kept getting stuck and dropping down behind. The built-in wardrobe contained the floor safe (complimentary) and housed about 10 hangers. We could have done with more but didn't ask so got by without. The bed was very soft and took a while to get used to. We preferred the bed at the Sheraton Maui (where we'd just spent 4 nights). I couldn't work out how to switch off the radio (complete with iPod dock) so we just turned it down for the week. We liked the floor to ceiling windows and also the little window along the floor line which opened up for fresh air. 

The marble bathroom was seriously the biggest  I have ever seen in any hotel (I've worked in quite a few  in the past). Double sinks, full bath, full separate shower, stacks of fluffy white towels and the best shaving mirror ever. The ""Trump Spa"" branded toiletries were fantastic and included shampoo, conditioner, body wash, sugar scrub, body lotion, body cream, and shower sponge. I was so taken with the products I bought some to bring home. Goodies were replaced daily. 

The staff were fantastic. Nothing was too much trouble at all and everyone was polite, friendly and cheerful. We grabbed a beach bag at no charge from the concierge every day which contained towels, botlled water, fruit and sunscreen. A thoughtful touch. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants, although we did have drinks on the terrace one evening. The prices were reasonable for that standard of hotel, although the mojitos were just a little better at the Sheraton Maui. 

The pool was a bit of surprise. It's basically an infinity edge, two-lane lap pool with a square add-on for the jacuzzi at one end and another square add on for wading at the other end. For the size and class of hotel, the pool is lacking. That said, there's an ocean over the road so if the kids and babies splashing about become too much, best to head there.  

There's also a very good Spa (I'm told) but I didn't use it. Nor did we use the gym, although we had a look and it seemed adequate. A couple of cardio machines (treadmill and eliptical) and some free weights. Nothing special. The grandly-named library houses about ten books, daily newspapers and also two free internet terminals with printer. 

A couple of minor niggles as follows:
- the plush bath robes were fantastic, but far more suited to Alaska than Hawaii. Cotton, short-sleeved robes would have been just as nice and far more functional. 
- the halogen lights in the low-ceiling bathroom were just too warm to stand under for any length of time. Again, more suited to Alaska than Hawaii. 
- the lack of a shower screen or curtain took a bit of getting used to. Water pretty much went everywhere, which wasn't ideal. 
- maybe because we were at the end of the corridor, but our room wasn't made up until very late in the day for most of the time we stayed. It's annoying when you want a nanna nap before dinner!
- the pool was a disappointment, as were the sun loungers, which were in shade most of the day. 
- we still haven't worked out why it is that our party of three couples (one with a baby) were spread over three different floors. Not a big deal, but we would have liked to have been co-located. 

Overall we enjoyed our stay at the Trump Towers but I'm dubious about going back. It's not ocean-front (although charges as if it is) and although luxurious, we didn't really need the extras such as the wine fridge etc which no doubt bumped up the cost.","Date of stay: May 2011","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

We slept sooooo good, hard to do in a hotel, but not this one.  XL Rooms are very quiet and beds are sooooooo comfy. 
the only bad thing is their hot tub is very small, but we all crowded in it anyway.  
the pool is a lap pool almost but with amazing views of the ""skyscrapers"" and sunset.   Everything seemed new and Clean, which I insist on.  The tile in pool area had no sign of mold or aging.  I poked my head in the spa, there are individual jazuzzis but you have to book a service.  $$$$
The gym was my favorite, new equipment, unlimited cucumber and lemon iced water. 
The office area is great for internet access and printing up whatever documents you may have.  We were there for Friday nite fireworks, we viewed them from lounge area and my daughter who is 17 was able to sit with me.  The architecture of the building had me constantly looking at details, very modern.  but the best part was when we were leaving, after waiting a bit too long for a taxi to aiport, they sent a limo to take us for the same price!

Oahu was the first stop on our vacation where most of our time was spent on other islands.   I chose the Trump after reading months of tripadvisor reviews on this property and its competitors.  We are glad we picked this hotel and can say most of the reviews are spot on.  The Trump isn't perfect, but if you want a top tier hotel in Waikiki for you and your kids, it's the best value for your money.

One of the best things we discovered from reading prior reviews was to use Jet Luxury Resorts in booking this property.  It saved us hundreds on two suites and they really came through for us. After arriving and finding out that one of our rooms did not have a pull out sofa as we were told it would, and as a result we were going to be short on beds for our group, a rep from Jet Luxury Resorts made the incredibly generous decision to pay for an extra room for us.  My wife and I were amazed and so appreciative.

That aside, here are our pros and cons on this property:
Pro's:  
*large living areas in every unit, including kitchen (or kitchenette for the studios).  To get this kind of space in any comp hotel on the strip would mean going with their biggest suites, so a huge value there.

*Brand new property and everything is top of the line and spotless.  You might take this for granted until you look at some of the Trump's competitors, as we did, and realize that they all look worn in comparison (some more than others).

Con's:
*Not right on the beach.  Yes, most rooms have a nice ocean view, and yes, the beach is just a couple of minutes walk away.  But for those for whom the beach is very important, the Trump's competitiors (at least the properties I compared it to and thought of choosing instead...such as the Halekulani and the Royal Hawaiian) have the big advantage here.  These other properties, which we walked through and had a drink in, also have more of a Hawaiian ""feel"".  The Trump could be a (great) hotel in any US city.

*Pool and pool area.  The other reviews you read about this are true.  The Trump infinity pool is long, but ridiculously narrow.  It is really just a glorified single lap pool.  Worse, later in the afternoon, when the hotel's restaurant ovens turn on, the vents spew out strong smells and smoke right over the pool. Yuk!  In addition, the majority of the lounge chairs around the pool are under a ceiling and completely without sun any time of day.  And considering that the pool area is on the hotel's sixth floor, there's usually a bit of a breeze and it can be chilly.  I think most guests and residents quickly realize this and as a result, the pool area seemed rather dead the entire time we were there.  My kids and I were in the pool quite a bit, and they enjoyed it, but I'm glad it was the first hotel pool we experienced on this trip and not the last.

*Concierge seemed to have it's preferred vendors best interests in mind instead of their guests.  Whether it was asking the concierge desk for a quote on a car service from/to the airport or an activity (Pear Harbor), the prices they quoted me were incredibly more expensive (in some cases 2 or 3 times more) than anything I easily found myself.  I don't mind paying whatever I need to for something, as long as I feel I'm getting value, but with the concierge I felt I was just being taken.

If you're looking for a sophisticated, quality hotel in Honolulu, I'd probably recommend the Halekulani if you're a couple (especially honeymooners and those celebrating Anniversaries) or the Royal Hawaiian if you're with friends and lying on the beach and being in the middle of everything is most important to you.  But if you're a family with kids, even with the pool drawback, I'd choose the Trump.  If you know it's shortcomings going in, you won't be disappointed.  I give the Trump four stars and Jet Luxury Resorts five stars.","Date of stay: April 2011","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

I will lay out what you can expect here after staying a full 7 nights in a Beach Studio room (cheapest one I think)

1. The rooms are very clean, spacious enough to do whatever work or activity you need. They are cleaned daily with complementary bathrobes as well.
2.  The complementary WiFi in every room is a bonus (I found the speeds excellent, with no troubles connecting). 
3. Parking sucks. There is no doubt about it. The trump charges a whopping $28 PER DAY for their MANDATORY valet service, which means you have to tip them as well for about $30. This will probably cost you more than the rental car itself. However there is a parking lot RIGHT across the street that you can pay about $15/day for run by the Hale Koa hotel. THIS is the way to go, and no stupid valets begging for your cash.
4. There is a kitchenette with a decent size fridge, microwave, coffee maker, toaster, blender, and 2 stoves. We exploited the hell out of this. Our first day we went to Costco and picked up groceries we stocked in their fully loaded kitchen. It was great an we saved tons of money. You'll go from eating out 3 times a day to once a day, and the convenience of having a quick breakfast to start your day is great. We had daily toast, cereal, and even made some pasta, salads, and smoothies. This and combination of a Farmer's Market is all you need to have delicious, healthy, nutritious, cheap food in Waikiki.
5. The location isn't bad. It's pretty much on the Northwest corner of Waikiki, but honestly there's so much hustle and bustle there I don't think it's worth being right in the middle of the area anyway. It is NOT beach front. You have to cross a road to get to the beach, and will take about 3-4 minutes from the time you leave the hotel on foot. This also means they have nothing like beach chairs, umbrellas, or any actual property on the beach itself. If you want this stuff you have to pay the rental guys through the nose for it. The area of beach it leads to isn't pretty thin as well unless you walk a ways. All in all though the Waikiki beach isn't he best on the island by far unless you JUST want to surf. It's far too crowded and noisy if all you want to do is just lie on a towel all day.
6. People have complained about the pool. I can't say much about it since I just looked at it and left. I see no reason to go swim in a pool when there's a gigantic ocean a half block away. It is quite small. But I didn't come all the way from Canada to use some chlorinated pool so I couldn't care less.
7. One nice complementary item they offered was a beach bag you could take to the beach, This included 2 towels, 2 chilled waters, and 2 pieces of fruit (apple & orange usually). We heavily exploited this and used it pretty much everyday. 
8. They do have a restaurant & spa which we completely avoided because the prices were frankly obscene. They advertised a breakfast bunch for a paltry $59 per person, and those are rum-soaked omelettes you're eating. I have no idea how good the food is but it makes sense to just stay away from it.
9. They also offer free local calls which is handy for booking things, and a widescreen LG flat panel which was never turned on if you like that stuff.
10. Bathrooms were clean, well stocked, and clean daily. Spacious too.

Trump is a good hotel. Just don't park and swim there and you'll have a good time. Keep in mind part of the price goes into that kitchenette, so USE IT!","Date of stay: April 2011","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

other comments talk about bad internet but i had no problem however it was getting upgraded while we were there anyway..... yes the pool is small but when it wasnt busy it was great for laps and the infinity effect was cool.  poolside service was great ( try the sushi ) but expensive... the breakfast buffett was the ultimate in ripoff and should be skipped.... try eggs and things up the street, it lines up but if u try the omellete you will understand, i grabbed the pager and walked back to the hotel and when it went of we hustled, worked twice but dont tell the egg nazi you were doing that... aside from that we would do breakfast at the outrigger on the beach, look for the coupon which is in the coupon book in the lobby of the hotel, great deal at the shore bird with a coupon.... Blt the in house steak house was great and blows away ruth chris but is just as expensive if not a bit more... lamb was to die for and the burger requires a big mouth and could just be one of the best ever, oh ya the yorkies are the speciality, unbelievable,,, keep em for breakfast and try them with jam... wow...
we took a tour of a number of rooms with a great and very informative salesman jeff skinner who was a great guy, no pressure  and was probablly one of the best salesman i ever met... alas jeff your product per sq ft is way ovepriced comparitivlly speaking and at the end of the day we found the traffic a little to noisy....

Their excellencies are not limited to the services, location, and cleanliness of the room. In a secured large room, a comfortable king size bed and pillows, elegant living room furniture, a huge marble bathroom with a large/deep tub and complete amenities including toothbrush/paste and slipper, and kitchenette with dishes and cooking wares. For two bed rooms or more, there are washer/dryer with detergent. They provide housekeeping at least twice per day. Our trip to Hawaii for ten nights and 11 days was very special not only because of our 25th anniversary but also the kindness from all staff of the hotel. The reservation personnel asked any of my concerns or wishes via e-mail prior to our travel departure.  As a result, they upgraded our room as we arrived at hotel, provided us a very spacious room with excellent views from lanai (balcony), and presented us a chill bottle of champagne for our anniversary. The hotel also daily provides all customers a thermos beach bag with towels, bottles of cold water, a snack box with apple and orange, and a bottle of sunscreen lotion. From our 17th floor balcony, we watched a rainbow over the ocean almost every morning, green mountains with cotton candy clouds, romantic city lights at night, and fireworks at the Waikiki Village every Friday.  Since there are huge public parking lots covered by beautiful trees in front of the hotel, nothing blocks our view. Sometimes we had a little visitor from the park, Brazilian Cardinal!  The U.S. Postal Office is across the street; therefore, we were able to mail home all souvenirs prior to our departure.  We would like to special thank to the Attaché Manager who made our trip to Hawaii very special, sweet and unforgettable. She always assisted us in very professional, friendly, and kind manners. While we were sightseeing or at beach, she daily assisted us to make restaurant reservations, get groceries, and any other matters.  We will definitely stay this hotel again!

I quickly pulled up our trusted Tripadvisor and this hotel pulled up as the #1 hotel in Waikiki.  The reviews were spot-on.
Since we were there only one night, I can't comment on some of the longer term amenities.  I know that you can request your favorite snack foods to be stocked in the kitchenette.  This kitchenette in our studio room was right by the door - it was so clean and well-stocked with everything you would need to cook a meal that I was impressed.  The complimentary teas and coffees were great too - we even took the leftovers which we never do.  Welcoming us were some macaroons - yummy!
The bathroom was well-appointed with a full rain shower and a deep soaking tub.  The room was very spacious and was very clean.  The bedroom was nicely appointed with the typical flat-screen TV and iPOD speaker/alarm system.  The bed was comfortable and the great thing was that the ROOM WAS QUIET!!!
The service staff were all very friendly and professional.  After the nightmare of dealing with the crudy service at United Airlines, it was so refreshing to have a nice welcome from the hotel with the welcome leis made of seashells and seeds.  This hotel made an otherwise horrible start to our vacation wonderful again.
The location was tremendous for me!  It was right off a great shopping stretch that reminded me of Rodeo Dr, plus Nobu was just 2 blocks away!!!  Since it wasn't on the main drag, it was a little less busy and noisy.  Although we didn't have time to check out the beach, it looked like it was just across the street from the hotel.
If you have to be stranded in Honolulu for the night, shopping, dining and sleeping in style are the ways to go!  The Trump definitely contributed to saving our vacation.  Truthfully, we were surprised by how understated this hotel was in the decor and service.  I would definitely stay here the next time we plan a vacation to Waikiki.","Date of stay: April 2011","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We thought we would splash out on Trump. Check-in was great and easy and the lobby was beautiful.

You can't fault the trump for their customer service.

Our room was nice. Great bed. . Also on checkin you get handed ""trumptations"" which are extras you can buy...  they made it sound really wonderful however the price is not listed , it just says ""for a fee"". I was too afraid to find out what the fees were. 

We did get a nice treat left for us by housekeeping one day. That was fancy. Macarons. :-) That was great.

I felt some of these should have been included considering how much you pay for the room. Like the turndown for example.

I liked that there was a kitchenette with a microwave and real cutlery, however there is not really a table you can sit and eat. There is a desk but thats about it. It's great for if you just want to eat in. However , this is located at beachwalk and there are so many great restaurants that you probably won't be using your kitchenette much.

Overall it was a good experience but I was not that keen on the location as it was not on the beach.","Date of stay: March 2011","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We did receive complimentary cookies,popcorn, milk and juice which was very nice.  We were there for 6 nights and there were 3 times which we had to ask them to clean the room and 2 times which they did not turn in our beds.  There were times when we were given boxes of soaps and the boxes was crushed and looked used.

All staff were great and polite except for one.  When we left, we had made our own transportation to go to the airport but he was late and therefore, I had asked the receptionist if I can use the phone.  She was reluctant but helped me dial instead and when I told her that I have to call that person back in 5 minutes.....boy you should have seen her face.

Even though the rate was not inexpensive (it is the Trump after all) I think it was money well spent considering the location, accommodations and service.  This is our third trip to Oahu and the 1 bedroom suite we stayed in with our two young sons (3 & 5) was by far the best hotel room we have stayed in as a family.  The kitchen facilities were very useful and the first time we have enjoyed a kitchen with equipment that matched ours at home (Wolf, Subzero & Bosch).  The suite was virtually brand new and the design overall (wood cabinetry, granite countertops, marble bathroom with deep soaker tub) could be described as classic luxurious contemporary with a hint of Hawaii.  Service from all of the staff is outstanding.  We were routinely greeted by name and everyone made an extra effort to be helpful -- from proactively printing out driving directions, offering beach toys for our kids and the beach bag tote with water, fruit and towels was very helpful.  The only minor downsides was the swimming pool, while elegant (it is an infinity edge pool) was narrow and did not get much sun; also the restaurants were exceptionally expensive ($17 dollars for buffet breakfast for a 3 year old).","Date of stay: March 2011","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

They cheerfully exchanged my room when I complained about my neighbors smoking on the balcony (I had to wait a few hours, but it was no big deal). 

The rooms are clean and have a full kitchen (with all small appliances and utensils you could need) that was a great convenience for preparing light meals and keeping drinks/snacks in the room.  The hotel provides a very good lineup of channels for free, including HBO.  The restaurant on the ground floor (BLT) was excellent, but I don't think it's affiliated with the hotel (the hotel food does not come out of this kitchen). Overall, I would recommend this hotel based on the staff and kitchen setup in the rooms.  It has the same problems of all hotels in the area - very noisy from hotel HVAC and service trucks running 24 hours a day.

Now for suggestions to improve.  1) The quality of food from room service and hotel restaurant was dismal.  All food is expensive in Waikiki hotels, but this food was no better than what you would get at a truck stop, AND it cost an arm and a leg. I ordered room service one night - a chicken dish with two glasses of wine and a side salad - the bill was over $100.  The chicken was a breaded filet that had been fried and a slab of cheese melted over the top (think ""Old Country Buffet"") - It tasted like it was probably a frozen, breaded patty. Salad was mediocre at best.  I also ate in the restaurant adjacent to the pool where I ordered the fish tacos - I've had better at Jack-in-the-Box.  2) Wi-Fi was slow and non-existent depending upon where I was in the room.  3) The lights in the bathroom put out so much heat that I could barely stand to get ready in there. I took all my things to the hallway mirror to escape the heat. Also, no AC vent in the bathroom meant it was a complete heat box in there.","Date of stay: March 2011","Trip type: Traveled solo","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Note: The staff were quite awkward throughout our stay. Many of them seemed quite young. Maybe they are inexperienced in customer service positions? I would suggest the hotel spends a bit more time training them. 

The cold towels and water at check-in were a nice touch.

Our room was a deluxe ocean view studio and well appointed. The bed was comfortable and the lanai was spacious and had a great view of the ocean. We enjoyed watching the sunrise and spotting humpback whales in the distance. The kitchenette was great for preparing light meals. We did not like the bathtub/shower. It was very poorly designed. There is a small glass partition attached to the tub instead of a shower curtain and there is no way to take a shower without getting the floor and toilet wet. I'm surprised they haven't fixed this deficiency. The complementary hi-speed internet was extremely slow when it was actually working. They have a business center (computers and printer) if you need to check in for flights and the internet isn't working in your room. 

The hotel location is great and very close to Fort Derussy, Waikiki beach, shopping, restaurants, etc. The concierge desk has complimentary beach bags which are filled with beach towels, bottled water, a couple of pieces of fruit and sunscreen. This was a service we'd never experienced before and quite liked. More hotels should offer this service. 

There was one person that really stood out during our stay - Dennis at the concierge desk. He was courteous, friendly, knew a lot about the area and restaurants and gave us some great advice. He made sure we were always taken care of and we really appreciated it. Thank you Dennis!

The main reason we booked into the Trump on a layover from Auckland to Big Island was the reviews on Tripadvisor.  Let's be frank and say that American Hotels are usually average at best.  Asian Hotels really know how to provide significantly above average service.   Mandarin Oriental Singapore is an example.  We live in New Zealand and are not Asian or American.

I think the Trump at Waikiki is about as good as one can expect from an American hotel. The room was new, very clean and had all the modern conveniences one would expect in an excellent American hotel.  There were a few very nice touches for our 4 year old, like 5 different glasses of flavoured milk in the fridge (nothing for Mum and Dad who were paying the bill,but the delight on our daughters face was worth it !) A special colouring book, with named crayons, and last but not least a special child's step at the bathroom vanity.  Our daughter was delighted - it's weird that we can spend over $2000 per night for a beachfront villa on a private island in the South Pacific, yet our 4 year old prefers the Trump in Waikiki - it amazes me.  The in room coffee was excellent compared to other American hotels that serve up weak dark water and call it coffee.

We ate at the Steak House on property  (BLT?) and had a good meal.  The service was good if not overly friendly. What is it about some American waiters that seems false.  In NZ and Australia the wait staff are genuinely friendly and not after a tip.  I think it is the culture difference where in NZ to be rich and pompous is considered unacceptable and reviled  yet in the US it is acceptable and lauded.

We did not use the pool,spa or any other services, so cannot comment on these.   I think the Trump is the best hotel to stay at in Waikiki given my limited knowledge of only 2 trip to Honolulu, but given my numerous trip to many 5 star hotels globally..","Date of stay: February 2011","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

One of the best things was being able to pick up a beach bag with beach towels, fruit, bottled water and sunscreen whenever you wanted to head out to the beach, which was less than a block away. We also received 2 bottles of water at you bedside with the turn down service. The cons of the hotel were the small pool, mediocre restaurants and not being beachfront.","Date of stay: February 2011","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

First of all, I want to mention this hotel is certainly not 5* like a Four Seasons/Peninsula/Mandarin Oriental.  If you are expecting this kind of 5* treatment/amenities/polish, I suggest you go elsewhere.  The Trump is solid -- just not to this other high level.

First, my main complains about the hotel.

1)The bathroom.  I booked the least expensive room, and the bathroom was small and poorly designed.  Specifically, the shower/bath installation was designed by an incompetent.  As you will see in the accompanying video, there is only a fixed piece of glass that covers at most 1/4 of the opening of the shower stall.   So, when you take a shower, water spews out of the basin all over the adjacent floor and toilet.  Even when I put my body as close to the wall as possible, I still could not prevent the massive water drain.  Very poor design.  Next, the hurdle you need to jump to get in and out of the shower is terribly annoying and painful.  I am 5'9"" and had trouble; I pity the person who is shorter.

2)The Internet speed is terribly slow -- slow to the point where the connection is almost useless.  Yes, the Internet is complementary (or should I more accurately say included with your room rate).  The highest speed I got was 0.75Mb/sec down and 0.25Mb/sec up (and this was at 7AM).  If I tried to stream a 384k clip, and I had major problems with this simple feat.  Trump seriously needs to up the Internet speed per connection.

3)Value.  The lowest available rate was $299/night (a promotional rate) during my stay, and I felt this hotel is not worth the money.  There are other 4* hotels in Waikiki where you will get more value for your money.

Lobby/Check-In:

Upon arriving at the hotel, I was greeted warmly by valet and given a men's lei.  The employee then took my baggage at showed me to the elevator leading to the lobby.  When I arrived at the lobby, the employee was very nice and professional but clearly hurried the transaction as she was the only one manning the front desk.  She was very stressed dealing with me and taking calls from other guests.  Also, I noticed later in the stay that others got cold towels and a cold beverage at check-in; I did not get this (even though I looked very tired (since I just flew 11 hours).

Room:

I booked a standard room (around 300-350 square feet), and it was small but had the bonus of a small kitchenette.  The TV was excellent in its clarity and having plenty of channels from which to choose.  The bed was the best part of the room experience -- soft and cozy.  The desk area was plenty adequate, and the lanai was large and offered some excellent views.

Spa/Exercise:

I was disappointed when I went to the spa only to discover it did not have a sauna or steam room -- just treatment rooms.  The exercise facility is a separate room on the way to the spa and  is open via room key 24 hours (yea!).  There are plenty of modern TechnoGym machines, and the hotel was gracious enough to include cold water (with cucumber and lemon) and a cold sports drink dispenser.

Pool:

The pool area is small and is located on the same floor as the lobby.  The pool is infinity-edge and is very small; I would hate to see this place when the hotel is fully booked.  Also, there is a small hot whirlpool with the pool installation.  It was nice to be able to lookout of the pool towards the ocean and adjacent neighborhood; I was just glad I was at the pool when it was not busy.

Cleanliness:

Excellent.  Not only was the room spotless, but I saw the hotel employees cleaning the main areas of the hotel almost constantly.  This is one of the best hotels I have stayed in for keeping its physical appearance up to shape.

Location:

Excellent.  I think this is the best aspect of this hotel.  You are steps away from the beach and  Kalakaua Avenue (main street through Waikiki).  There are many places to eat just downstairs from your room, and the area is relatively quiet since you are adjacent to Fort DeRussy.

Final Thoughts:

I wanted this hotel to be more on the level of a Four Seasons/ Peninsula/Mandarin Oriental and was disappointed that the polish of the former three hotels was not met.   When in Waikiki next time, I will opt for one of the 4* accommodations as I feel the price point of the Trump does not get me a much higher level of service and amenities.

It was our first visit to Honolulu. For us, it was a wonderful stay. The customer service given by check-in, valet and concierge was congenial and efficient.  We had a partial ocean view room and it was exactly as described. The view was lovely, the room space was cosy but fine. The bed was wonderful. I am a frequent traveller and  a good bed is one of the most important factors in my stay. The room and bathroom were clean with elegant marble finishings. The bathroom was quite a nice size and the shower was wonderful as it was not set in a tub but flush with the floor. Housekeeping was always prompt when we asked our room to be made up and the turn down service was at an appropriate time. I had seen the reviews on this site before I booked the trip so I knew about the issues some reviewers had with the small size of the pool. It was not a factor for us as our desire was to  experience some gentility, tranquillity and luxurious comfort at the end of our long days exploring Honolulu and Oahu. This need was met. The only minor negative comment I would have is about the food in the hotel. It was not as good as I expected given the rest of the experience. It was not awful just rather lacklustre and very ordinary. Overall, we had a good stay and would stay again as long as the customer service, standard of cleanliness and room quality remain high. This would hinge on management  not beginning to rest on their laurels but to strive even harder to maintain and surpass customer expectations. A big thank you to the staff who made it such an enjoyable experience.","Date of stay: January 2011","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Best staff in Hawaii by far.","This hotel is fantastic and I cannot say enough things about how terrific this place is.   From the beautiful rooms, the soft bathrobes, the comfortable bed and pillow menu, this hotel is pure elegance all the way.   You feel like you are special when you stay at the Trump and it feels like a home away from home.   We were impressed by the whole Trump experience from start to finish.  When we arrived we were provided with a hospitality room until our room was ready.  The previous guest didn’t wish to leave on time so that we had to wait until after 8.00pm to finally check into our room as we had booked through Jets Luxury Resorts and you are assigned specific rooms.   

I disagree with the reviewer who said that the staff were unfriendly, we stayed here for almost one month and the staff greeted us every time we left the hotel and upon our return.   We were very impressed that some of the staff even knew us by name.  Not once did we encounter any rude staff.  Any questions that we had for staff, they were only too willing to assist.  I also did not encounter any problems when we asked for taxis as mentioned in one of the reviews.   At all times they arrived promptly.   On one occasion the valet even walked down the road to get a taxi for us.  

As to the remark about the horrible bottled water provided, it is complimentary bottled water that is replenished everyday and is a local product.   The water tasted fine to us and it didn’t have any sort of after taste at all.  When it comes to the taste of water, it is a matter of personal preference and if you don’t like it buy your own!

The onsite Wai’olu restaurant is nice and the food is tasty.  They have both Japanese and Mediterranean options which is great.   The signature Mai Tai’s are the best Mai Tai’s in Hawaii by far and we have tried a few on our trips to Hawaii so if you are staying at the Trump, you should consider trying one or two.  

Whilst the hotel is beautiful, it is the staff at the Trump that set this place apart from their competition.   All the staff we encountered were very friendly and courteous.  In particular, Todd, Sean, Dianne, Travis, Cynthia were all very nice.  There were many other staff that were nice also, but their names escape me at this time.   Even the cleaning staff were all friendly.   I think that Trump owners should give the staff at the Trump a raise as if it were not for your staff; this hotel would be another typical hotel on the Waikiki strip.   

Having stayed at the Outrigger Reef last year for the same amount of time, I can honestly say that the experience at the Trump far exceeded our one from last year.   It is the attention to detail and the high end feel that sets the Trump apart from the competition.  We will be returning to Hawaii at the end of this year and will not consider staying anywhere but the Trump when in Waikiki.","Date of stay: January 2011","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

He makes sure that all of your questions are answered and really does try to give you the best deal.

This is our 6th trip to Waikiki and each time we have stopped at a different hotel.

Trump wins hands down for best accomodation we have ever stopped worldwide!! 

We went for my DH's 40th birthday - our first trip away without our 3 young children. We booked an Oceanview Studio room however were immediately upgraded to an Oceanview 1 bedroom apartment. This was gorgeous to say the least. Then on our second night the attache' phoned and offered a further upgrade to a two bedroom with den apartment on the Trump level at no extra cost.

We were blown away by the excellent service afforded to us by each and every staff member whilst we were there. They even left three little gifts over the ten day stay - first a canister of Trump Tea then a trio of Trump chocolates and finally on my DH's birthday a bottle of their Prosecco.

The staff from the valets to the spa staff to the concierge and attache were all super attentive and friendly, The added extras of bottled water and fully stocked beach bags when visiting the beaches were just the icing on the cake.

Could not think of a bad thing to say about Trump - except for the fact that we had to leave and return home.

We paid less than a half of their published full rate, thus found it good value for money. 

The location is close to everything in Waikiki: shops, restos, beach. Being on the western edge of town, also convenient to get to Ala Moana and downtown district. The hotel faces on Saratoga Road where large vehicles circulate till late at night. I found it a bit noisy for vacation. At the back of the building (city-view), less traffic.

Complimentary newspaper and high-speed internet were appreciated.

Staff were not polite (as at Haleklani) nor friendly (as at Outriggers). Othereise some smile with tension. Some organizational problem ?? 

We booked a deluxe ocean view studio. We found our room adequate and as expected. Their web site shows it properly. Spacious enough for two of us. I liked the view from the room: from inside it is ocean view, once out on the balcony ocean and city view onto Hilton Hawaiian Village area not too close (therefore nicely lighted up at night) over Fort Derussy Park (therefore greenery during day time: scarce in Waikiki I think). We enjoyed the fireworks by Hilton (thank you fellow Tripad reviewers!), :it lasted about 5 min (only!). One morning, a complete half circle of rainbow over FD Park was heart-touching. Completely private balcony, not to see next door balconies.

The room decoration is with not much of local charm, looking like a city apartment in any large cities. Loved the bedding (soft matress).

The kitchenette was handy for breakfast and apero before dining out (we did not cook to dine) For grocery shopping, KCC market and Whole Foods at Kahara Mall were enjoyable. The fridge was too noisy for a studio room.

The bath room was unproportionally large, with a fixed shower (which I dislike). Only one hook and one towel rack in the bathroom and no laundry rope/rack, therefore no place to hang wet bathing suits etc. The toothbrush and body sponge are made in China. Ample stock of towels held all the time. Comfy bathrobe.

Trump branded bottled purified water, offered in the room, tasted quite horrible. 

We did not try their restaurant. One night when we thought about it, it was deserted except two tables at around 20:00. 

We did not try the open-air swimming pool. It was too windy to enjoy it. 

Staff untrained. No hospitality either.
Porters and concierge seldom greet to guests. Many of them speak and behave with low morale or rude sometimes especially. This may well have discouraged us to use their services and facilities like SPA.

One day we were stunned to see a porter, with a cart full of someone else’s stuff, proceed to take a lift to go up, leaving us behind. He just looked at us and stepped into the lift with the cart and shut the door in front of us without a word. 

Concierge desk is attended only during daytime. Anyway, helpless, not experienced, with little professional knowledge. When I enquired about their “beach services” one evening, no concierge was available, Front desk did not know even on which part of the beach their beach services (mentioned on their web saite) are held. A part-time worker? For details, he sent us to concierge for the following day, and she in turn told us to walk up to a desk on the beach to ask tariff etc. We lost interest and did not bother. 

Another day, a guest we saw at concierge desk enquired how much it would cost to get to Hanauma Bay, such a major place to visit, by taxi, and the concierge lady could not answer and started asking around.

When we enquired about an event, concierge was not aware of the event and had to call us back with no result. We soon happened to walk by and it was just a couple of min. walk from Trump. 

Once we decided not to rely on Trump for hotel services, we enjoyed our stay all right. For activities, next door Outrigger on the Reef was helpful with hospitality and willingness, open to non-residents. We rented a car for non-consecutive days from National and Hertz at their own desks at night. We also booked a taxi transfer back to the airport, thus avoiding unpleasant contact with porter/valet desk. 

Overall, Trump Waikiki Beach Walk was good enough for what we paid. If understanding it as a condo with daily cleaning services and not a hotel, then no disappointment. Trump’s business is that of property and not of hotel services perhaps. We would come back, hoping to see improved services.

After multiple attempts we gave up and headed back to the elevator where we met another staffer who volunteered to get us into the room and get us new cards immediately. He opened the door only to find the room was already occupied. We all headed back to the desk where it was explained the wrong room was written down. Shortly a new set of keys was issued and we all headed back to the elevator again. This time we got no further than the inside of the elevator since the key would not work there so we once again returned to the desk where I told them in no uncertain terms they had one more chance because 3 strikes made an out and that I better be extremely happy when we opened the door to the room when we got there.  No upgrade, but the 3rd time was the charm...

The room was spacious with the partial kitchen and over-sized tub as advertised.

Lets now address the pool and hot tub. The pool is not small, its TINY. Its a short lap pool about wide enough for 2-3 to swim side by side. The hot tub is about the size one gets in each suite in the caribbean...It seats 3-4 adults comfortably.  Unfortunately both were taken over by kids ALL DAY LONG...these kids ranged in age from diaper-bearing to 9-10 years old and came with all of their ancillary equipment-swimmies, tubes, toys, etc. They have been running wild jumping into the water from everywhere for the past 4 days while parents and staff ignored their every movement.....Additionally if its relaxing in the sun that you desire, this is not the place for that either. The location of the pool is such that only about 15 of the lounges are exposed to direct sun and the rest are under cover

The hotel website says to ""vacation like a Trump"". I wonder how long it would take Donald to say ""you're fired"" so that he could actually vacation like a Trump!!!

The overall service is quite good and the staff is always very friendly. They pay attention to the little things,  but in my opinion ignore the big things...","Date of stay: January 2011","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

The room was beautiful, clean, and the bathroom was huge with a sunken tub for two and excellent shower. We had a great view and although it's not truly on the beach, it's only less than a block away. The concierge offers a nice beach bag with complimentary water, fruit and towels. This was a definite plus. 
The pool is small in comparison to other hotels but because of the high end clientele the pool was not full of kids and we truly enjoyed it. The cocktail and snack service at the pool was great. Nice hot tub in the middle. 
The Wai`olu Lounge restaurant had great cocktails and very good sushi. It's very casual and the service is great. Our waiter, Shaun, was very friendly and remembered us every time we dropped in for cocktails. 
BLT, the steak restaurant at the hotel is superb! Pricey but worth it. The food is amazing as is the service. A block away, there's Roy's, another pricey restaurant that's worth every penny. 
So why not a true 5 star hotel, yet? Inconsistent service and sometimes a lack of attention to details.
The room service breakfast was hit or miss. The food was cold a few times and they forgot part of our order once. 
The staff was extremely friendly and hard working, but the concierge seemed understaffed at times. 
They don't anticipate your needs as does a true 5 star hotel. They have an attache service but it's not clear what their role is in comparison to the concierge. 
We rented a car and they were happy to start the process but we had to finish it unlike other 5 star hotels which take care of the process from start to finish. 
We had questions about some of the sites and activities we wanted to experience and they provided information instead of offering the service. 
This might seem small but it's these details that make a true 5 star hotel.","Date of stay: December 2010","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

The hotel is actually serviced luxury apartments; our apartment 1722 had a wonderful kitchen (full of quality kitchen items that you could not fault). A dining area that seated four and a lounge area, complete with large plasma screen, also a desk area and separate bedroom (with another large plasma screen). The bathroom was very spacious and you could enter from the hallway and the bedroom. The bathtub was extremely deep (great for soaking).  Loved the open shower and the water pressure was great. Double sinks and plenty of white fluffy towels.  

The hotel is a year old so the rooms and furniture were still in good quality and very clean, another reason we chose this hotel over some of the other well known properties who received poor ratings on trip advisor for the quality of their room furniture etc.

Upon arriving on an early flight from Australia we were given a hospitality room to utilise until our rooms were ready, and this was very much appreciated.

The staff at this property is what make it an exceptional property.  From Todd who worked in the bar area and who remembered our drink preferences each night and who was always up for a quick chat about our day if the bar wasn’t over busy to Gemma and Dennis in Concierge who did a great job in booking our day trips and who always remembered our names. In fact everyone in the hotel always remembered your name, also special mention to Lawrence who was amazing cheerful and welcoming to us when we checked in.  

We chose this hotel from Trip advisor reviews and whilst we would agree with other reviews that yes the pool area is quite small and no where near as spectacular as some of the ones in the other resorts and hotels you also didn’t have to have hundreds and hundreds of people and children competing for a lounge bed and also there was considerably less noise that at some of the large hotel pools (believe me we could hear it from our room balcony), so the small pool area did not bother us.

The hotel prides itself on its VIP Attaché service and we cannot fault it, in fact Marilyn Sato and Dorilyn Kato went above and beyond the call of duty in organising for my husbands specially made Adidas Golf Shoes to be ordered and sent to the hotel prior to our arrival as we were not able to do this from Australia as the company would not accept anything but an American Credit card.  We especially would like to thank them for all the effort they went to and in fact we made a point of wanting to meet them and also Dean Anderson to thank them for all their assistance prior to our arrival.

Overall we had a very pleasant stay and would recommend this property if you are seeking more of a luxury serviced apartment hotel stay.  However, there are a couple of things that need mentioning. We were surprised that the hotel buffet breakfast did not have any cereals out (we have never come across a hotel anywhere in the world that does not have some sort of breakfast cereal in their buffet). Upon asking about cereals our waiter had not heard of Muesli but then managed to find some, however we were charged an additional $12.00 on top of the $32.00 per person for the buffet which I felt should have been advised to us not just placed on the bill, but certainly the hotel should look at including some sort of cereal in the buffet.  They did of course have a large amount of Japanese food out for their Japanese visitors, but no cereal and also no pancakes.

Housekeeping:  No turndown service on the first night and when we asked about it we were told yes they do turndown, but for some reason missed us the first night, however, the other nights they arrived, appreciated the complimentary water each night. Also no consistency with the towels each day and night, some times we got all smaller bath towels and other nights one large one (handy for the male of this party) and then smaller ones. 

 The rooms were cleaned to a high standard and the quality of the bath products were very good, however, on using the bath salts one night they were never replaced again so that cancelled out having another bath (I could have phoned down but to be honest when you are paying the price of the rooms that you are paying here, I shouldn’t have to do this).

I have to recommend the food in the bar and in particular the Black Truffle Risotto, it was so good the first night we went back for more on night two rather than go down the street for dinner, unfortunately the second night the Risotto was hard and not creamy so I had to sent it back, luckily the second time it came out perfect.  I think a little more work on the food and beverage department is in order, however, we had to keep reminding ourselves that this was not a five star hotel but a luxury serviced apartment property.

I also liked the fact that one of the Managers was in the breakfast area the morning we were discussing the fact that there was no cereal on the menu and we found out a day later he had written this down in his book as a follow up. John it was nice to meet you and have you listen to our observations about this. 

Overall this is a wonderful property but really because of their wonderful staff and with a little tweaking in housekeeper consistency and also the food and beverage department it would be an exceptional property.","Date of stay: December 2010","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

I rate the Trump Hotel right up there with the Halekalani and the Kahala, although it is a different type of stay. In some ways it feels more like a serviced apartment than a hotel - perhaps this is because of the rooms themselves, but I quite liked the autonomy this provided.  

The rooms are quite spacious and come with a kitchette and an empty minibar fridge and freezer which is a huge bonus for any traveller. I had a partial ocean view studio and it was as described. It's a new hotel so everything is nice and fresh and my balcony provided a perfect view of the Friday night firework show. The bathrooms are spacious too.

The Trump Hotel's location is great - you can walk to Honolulu Zoo at one end of Waikiki or Ala Moana shopping centre at the other with relative ease. It is also a high rise which is a huge advantage - Waikiki gets extremely noisy which is why I don't like to stay at the Halekelani.

Another positive is that this hotel doesn't seen to nickel and dime you like a lot of other hotels. During my stay there was bottled water replenished every evening and there was free wireless internet. The complimentary bags for the beach bags are great too.

The service was okay but it wasn't fabulous. I had a couple of incidents during my week long stay ... One of the staff knocked on my door when I had the do not disturb sign on (normally not a biggy unless you are sleeping off some jet lag) ... I was getting a parcel delivered after 10pm and asked the front desk (I spoke to two people about it) to hold it for me rather than calling me on arrival. I got a call at 10.50pm. Not a biggy but annoying to get a late call when you have informed the staff otherwise ...The bellstaff were a little hit and miss - forgot to call me a taxi on one occasion - and a couple of other incidents that doesn't give it five stars - for service, I believe the Kahala is better. Restaurant service wasn't great either. Having said that Housekeeping was great - both the morning and turndown service was exemplorary - they serviced your room as if you were walking into the room for the first time. 

Two things that really let this hotel down are; 1) the entrance - it feels like you are entering through a carpark and not very welcoming and 2) the pool - as others have noted, is impossibly small and not the type of pool you want to lay around. But these are design flaws - nothing that can be 'fixed' as such.

My recommendation? If you are on a budget, stay at the Waikiki Parc - if you are on your honeymoon stay in an ocean view room at the Halekelani - if you are celebrating your wedding anniversary stay at the Kahala - and if you have kids stay the Hilton. For everybody else, in my opinion, Trump is definitely the way to go.","Date of stay: December 2010","Trip type: Traveled with friends","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

We found all staff to be absolutely friendly and accommodating to all our requests.  As others have noted, the rooms have a complete kitchen, which we used to make our own breakfast each morning to save a couple of bucks.  
It is a very short walk to Waikiki beach, and each morning we sat out on our balcony, ate breakfast overlooking the beautiful beach and planned our attack for the day.  In spite of the busy-ness of the Waikiki area, we heard no street noise in our room.
The one thing bad thing happened at the pool.  We were sitting at the pool about 7 pm or so when an exhaust fan (and I mean an enormous industrial size venting system) for a kitchen in the Trump building began to vent cooking fumes above the pool.  When it didn't stop in 5 minutes or so, we headed out of the pool area.

All the staff at The Trump especially Akiko and Dean, did everything possible to accommodate us.  I cannot recommend this hotel, highly enough. 

They not only found as a room, but we were upgraded to a one bedroom suite with full state of the art kitchen and partial ocean view!  We have been to Hawaii on a number of occasions, and this is the best value in Waikiki for a luxury hotel, by far.  Thanks also to management, for the lovely bottle of welcome champagne. 

The Trump is brand new, contemporary and ultra modern.  The staff are young, attractive and genuinely happy!  They even wear really cute uniforms and look like they enjoy their jobs and really want to be there (note to the Moana Surfrider, get some new staff).

The hotel has a really good vibe, and is in a great (and much less busy) part of Waikiki. Not direct beach front, but only one street back and many rooms have ocean views.  They also provide beach bags, with towels, fresh fruit and bottled water every time you want to go to the beach.  The pool area with infinity pool is stunning, so we spent a lot of time there, anyway.

Close to the best shopping area and proximity to Ala Moana centre was excellent, as well as walking distance to all our favourite restaurants, like Roy's and Nobu.

BLT restaurant on ground floor of the hotel, is amazing!  May we also mention the best bartender in Waikiki and now our new, local friend Alejandro.  The guy is a true host, makes a mean cocktail and is a total professional.

We were greeted with the spirit of Aloha by the staff each and every day - they were all very warm and welcoming.  Our room had an understated elegance to it in both comfort and design.  The bedding was plush.  The bathroom was all marble, spacious, with a deep tub and an open shower.  The amenities in there were well thought out - even offering a dental kit (toothbrush, toothpaste, floss).  The full kitchen was stocked with an impressive array of culinary equipment that's normally not expected at hotels - from silverware, glassware, pots, pans, a toaster, a rice cooker!!, tupperware, the list goes on.  Our lanai was nice and we were happy to get a partial view of the ocean.  Free wi-fi was offered, as well.  Outside of the room itself, the comforts of the hotel seemed limitless.

On the way to the beach or park, it was a treat to swing by concierge and request for a beach bag which was insulated and equipped with a towel, cold bottle of water, suntan lotion (which smelled divine!), and a box of fruit.   The infinity pool was equally enjoyable.  It was nice that there were different depths of the pool to wade in (from 6 inches to 4 feet).  Considering we were with twin babies, it was nice they got to enjoy the water in the 6 inch section.  As we got out of the pool, heated blankets were available to quickly warm us all up.  The library of the hotel was nice and quiet with a great selection of reading material, and the 24 hour fitness center had state of the art equipment.

We happened to be at the hotel on a Friday night, so we hung out at the lobby, ordered their signature mai-tai, enjoyed sunset, the open view of the city skyline and then 7:30pm fireworks at the nearby Hilton Hawaiian Village.

The hotel's location was also ideal.  It's in a relatively quiet area across from Fort DeRussy park, but just around the corner is an up and coming trendy area of Waikiki with upscale boutiques and restaurants.  But if you're even craving for some local flavor, ""Eggs 'n' Things"" is just down the road.

We were speechless. Full kitchen, wine cooler, 2 balconies, 2 full baths, washer and dryer, large walk in closet. The most comfortable bed, and robes to melt into. 
     I treated myself to a Trump Spa Massage with Christine. It was unlike any massage I have ever experiences, completely over the top. My one regret is not purchasing a Trump Robe while I was there.
    If I wanted my car, I called to the garage, by car would be ready to go, AC on, and several bottles of cold water waiting for whatever the day brings.

I had ordered those ahead of time, but as a gift from the hotel for celebrating a 45th brithday, the strawberries were sent with a bottle of champagne, and a personal note to the birthdat girl.

The room I had was extremely well appointed and the bathrooms, well I thought I had died and gone to heaven, the bathrooms in heaven have to be like these!  It was quiet and very clean (yes, I immediately checked the mattress for ""you know what"" and this mattress was as clean as new!). 

This hotel is elegant and you feel like you've stepped above the crazy Waikiki hustle-bustle. The service is exceptional (thank you Tee for your wonderful treatment!). I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone, but especially if you like peaceful surroundings. The pool is tranquil and beautiful and the hotel is really just steps to the beach.

We reserved a One-Bedroom Ocean Front Suite and got upgraded to a Two-Bedroom (with an additional bathroom), even though we didn’t need or use the extra bedroom/ bathroom. Everything about this stay was wonderful from start to finish. We were given shell necklaces upon arrival and a complimentary bottle of champagne from the hotel. My partner had organised for Signature Mai Tais to be made for us and for rose petals to be displayed in the room – the room looked excellent, the petals were displayed very neatly on the bed (with towel swans!) and in and around the bath, and the Mai Tais were delicious. The views from our apartment were amazing – the palm trees and the ocean looked fantastic. Our balcony was perfectly placed for us to enjoy sunset every day and to enjoy the fireworks display at the Hilton Hawaiian Village (which is on Friday evenings). Our bed was extremely comfortable and so was the sofa.

We ordered room service twice, which came promptly and the food was excellent on both occasions. We had breakfast at the hotel every day except one – the atmosphere was very relaxed and the food was delicious. I was very impressed with the extensive smoothie menu and made sure to try a different one every day until I had tried them all – they tasted fab and came decorated with a pink flower – gorgeous! We also ate at the hotel’s BLT (steak) restaurant one evening, which was also first class. The cocktails and food were excellent and so was the service.

I really can’t say enough good things about our stay at this hotel – we had the best holiday of our lives. We were slightly baffled that the hotel only had one computer in the library (it’s the Trump!) and sometimes people had to wait to use the internet, but this wasn’t a huge issue. The air conditioning in our hotel room caught in my throat and made me cough and so we had to switch it off and it got quite humid (but I think I was coming down with something – my partner was fine). The pool was small, but big enough. The hotel was quiet when we were there so we didn’t have to share the pool with a lot of people. There was always chilled water and flavoured water by the pool and the poolside service was also excellent – I’ll admit we enjoyed a few cocktails as we were sunbathing. We also took advantage of the beach bag that the hotel provides filled with bottles of water, pieces of fruit, towels and suntan lotion. We found the Trump beach services and hired sunloungers and a parasol – this was on a great spot with only one row of sunloungers so quite private. The beach is only a two minute walk away from the hotel – across the road and down a small path, very convenient. In fact, the hotel was handy for everything in Waikiki while still having excellent views of the ocean.

We read a review before we came here, which described the staff as “tip-hungry”. We looked out for that during our stay, but on the contrary, staff seemed genuinely surprised and grateful whenever we did give them a tip. We had an amazing stay and hope to return again sometime in the future.","Date of stay: September 2010","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I wish we had stayed at the Trump the whole time.  The staff was amazing, the rooms were perfect, the bathroom was gorgeous, and the food was killer.  You are only a 2 minute walk from the beach and our room had a great view of the water plus the mountains.  I felt relaxed the moment I walked in.  One of the only complaints I have is that the pool is small, but then again, you're at the beach so if you really want to swim, I imagine you are headed to the ocean.  Also, be prepared to pay for parking -- it's expensive.  And I'm not sure it would be great for a family.  It's an elegant hotel -- perfect for a romantic getaway, less so if you have to constantly worry about kids breaking things.  If we stay on Oahu again, we'll stay here.  It was a great experience.

We are seasoned travelers who have high expectations for the places we stay.  The Trump International was perfection and more than met our high standards.  Before we arrived we were contacted by the hotels concierge to see if we needed anything for our stay.  I noted that it was my husbands birthday and we would like to book into the resturaunt for dinner.  

When we arrived we were greeted with a big Happy Birthday from the front desk.  (Nice that they noted it)  Then they upgraded our water view room to a water front suite.  (Great start!)  Once we arrived in our room a bottle of chilled champagne was waiting with a happy birthday note from the hotel.   My husband and I were very touched by this thoughtfulness.  The room was pure luxury with amazing views of the water and beach.  The bed was like lying down on a cloud - amazing comfort!!  

The hotel continued to impress with the concierge having fully equipped beach bags for guests use.  They included beach towels, chilled water, fruit and the option of sun cream.  Again, everything was thought of!

Dinner at the restaurant was excellent.  It was a Friday night, so there was even amazing views of fireworks from our table!  (There are fireworks every Friday night, so try to book a table with a view!)  At the end of the meal the hotel once again sent over a Happy Birthday desert.  A very sweet ending!

The hotel itself is very well placed.  The beach is right across the street and took about 1 minute to get there.  The world famous shopping begins the second you step out of the door,  We really could not have picked a better place.  I have never been a huge fan of Waikiki, but our experiance at the Trump Hotel has changed that.  We will definitely be back!!

Restaurants abound within a couple of blocks of the hotel including NYC favorites, Wolfgangs, BLT Steakhouse, Nobu, PF Changs, Cheesecake factory etc.  The price of the suite will stretch your budget, but to experience the Spectacular it is worth it.

The room was extremely well set up with comfortable furniture, very nice beds and quality linen. Very little noise entered the room either from the street or from other rooms.

Room service was magnificent, they brought the food in and set it out on the dining table even with such little touches as a vase with a flower or two, condiments and classy salt and pepper shakers. Butter knives, side plates and a little note to just let them know when we were finished so they could clean up after us.

This hotel came across very professional and experienced and yet I'm told this is their first summer since opening.

My only criticism would be that the rooms are so good it makes it harder to leave and see the sites.","Date of stay: July 2010","Trip type: Traveled on business","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

But that staff still eagerly greeted us, and gave us all our free leis.  A man guided us to the sixth floor lobby, and we were checked in.  Then our bellman came and led us to our 22nd floor room, and showed us around.   Our room was completely amazing!  It was very spacious, and had a great view of the city and the beach.   There were two bathrooms, two lanais, three hi def LCD tv, a den, a full kitchen, a living room, and a bedroom with a king bed.  The two couched can be transformed into pullout beds, and the staff will be glad to get you sheets for them.  We also found two robes and two pairs of slippers in the bedroom.  Everything about the place is classy.  Possible my favorite aspect of the hotel though is the amazingly friendly staff.  Everyone who works at the hotel is always smiling and excited to help you.  Ive never seen such  nice valets in my life.
The rooms are really easy to feel at home in.  My family almost didn't want to leave every morning.  
The Trump isn't right on the beach, but it's only about a five minute walk, and if you're on the right side, you will be able to see it very well.  You will also be able to see  the Hilton Hawaiian village fireworks on Friday night.
The pool isn't anything special, and neither is the lobby.  The infinity pool is not very big, and all you can see from it is buildings.

Then we were wonderfully surprised to be upgraded to a two-bedroom/three-bathroom suite on a high floor on occasion of celebrating our anniversary.  The rooms were impeccable- new, spacious, bright, comfortable, and very quiet.  There were three balconies overlooking Waikiki, Diamond Head, and the ocean.  The kitchen is large with Sub-Zero/Wolf appliances, well-equipped for cooking/dining, and has a large island with bar stools.  The Bosch W/D was very useful as well.

We traveled with young kids, who were welcomed by stuffed sea turtle toys, activity books, and personalized crayons.  The kids also liked their Trumpkids bathrobes.  The hotel staff brought up Candyland and chess/checker game set as well as some children's DVDs to our room without prompting.  We visited the small library and picked out several children's books for bedtime stories.  Whenever we encountered hotel staff, they always went out of their way to be friendly to the kids and talk with them.

The hotel sent us a complimentary bottle of champagne and chocolate-dipped strawberries for our anniversary.  Yet another example of how generous and thoughtful we found the hotel staff to be.  They provide chilled bottles of water, swim diapers, sun lotion, and towels by the pool & hot tub.  The concierge has beach bags filled with towels, bottled water, and fruit.

The night of our arrival, we watched the 4th of July fireworks from the hotel lobby balcony.  We had a great view and relaxed on the lounge chairs.  The hotel did not seem busy.  We never encountered another guest on our floor while waiting for the elevator.

What a great experience","Words can't say what a great experience staying at this hotel have been. The experience begins after you book with them-they send you emails to contact their atteche department for personalized touches like extra sheets and what kind of pillows, dehumidifier etc. From the moment that you arrive and are greeted by the valet staff, you are made to feel welcome and relaxed.  They put a lei made of shells on you and then one of them take you up in the elevator to the check in area where it has a beautiful view of the city. As you are checking in, the same person gets some refreshing cool towels for your party and cool down.  Friendly staff ready to get you situated and settled.  Then as you get your room keys, one of them walked you up the your room and gets you settled into your room.  (We stayed at the 1 bedroom with den and ocean view) which is great to stay in during fourth of July since the fireworks from there were spectacular.
Pros: Clean carpet, very roomy, everything was new and kept up, had a step stool waiting for the kids at the sink, water pressure was the best that I have experienced in any hotel, showers were open and curtain free.
If you are traveling with kids, the way they treated the kids made them feel so special and welcomed unlike other hotels-they greeted them with personalized crayons and coloring books on the bed, just their size slippers and bathrobes and welcome letter greeting them into the hotel telling them places to visit with their parents and the dvds and games that they can borrow should then need more entertainment. They even offer the Wii.  Amazing.  My kids kept screaming to go back because they felt so special. To top it all off, since they knew that one of our kids had a birthday, they send room service up with special treats for them but not just for one of them, they made sure to include something else for the other child so they don't feel left out-not that is so thoughtful. Free wi-fi, super comfortable beds and pillows, fully stocked kitchen
Cons: of course valet parking, not right on beach but just across the street from it
It is well worth the money to stay at this place-the staff just made you feels so welcome.","Date of stay: July 2010","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Out only problem really was the pool area, although it didn't effect us too much cause it was very quite. But the pool and surroundings aren't that big so this could get very cramped in high season.  Also it didn't make any difference to us but the pool bar never seemed open.  Although they're we're staff around if you needed something.  Also little bottles of water by the pool where a nice touch.

This hotel was also very good at re-stocking  amenities and water the room.  

Although lovely I think this hotel would probably appeal more to the business traveller, probably not a place for families, as it doesn't have direct access to the beach. The only other thing that could improve this hotel would be a seating area in the suite. We only had the basic suite, I'm guessing the more expensive ones have a seating area an balcony","Date of stay: May 2010","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Since the hotel is new, we had high expectations of the hotel to be clean, modern and comfortable which were definitely met; but what made Trump Waikiki stand out was how helpful and friendly the Concierge team was.  They helped plan our days, recommended activities and made all the necessary arrangements.

This hotel is not a resort style hotel.  Its style is closer to a very luxurious serviced apartment with a fully equipped kitchen even in our studio room (partial ocean view).  

The bathrobes provided were extremely comfortable.

The hotel is located one street from the beach but it takes less than 5 minutes to walk there. Even though restaurants and shops are just around the corner, we didn't notice any noise at all.

The hotel provided beach bags (towels, water, fruit) and free water each day which were nice touches.","Date of stay: April 2010","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The spa was nothing more than 4 rooms with no amenities, no ladies or gents locker facilities, nothing but a few showers and a dangerous large bath tub, the service at the spa over the telephone was ridiculous, I felt like I was bothering them asking simple questions. Because I am an avid spa-goer I decided to visit the spa to have a face to face conversation as their prices are very high for a simple treatment. I got the same attitude just in person. Both the gentleman and lady were abrupt and discourteous, I did not book any spa treatments thank goodness, that spa was nothing more than a few rooms thrown together, total joke for a ""Trump inspired spa"". 
I dined in their restaurant and after finishing my mediocre and over priced meal overheard the waiter complaining of the amount of tip I had left to his colleagues! 
I checked out the next morning and moved to the Royal Hawaiian Hotel where first class service is always given, This is a joke of a hotel, the amenities are a bore, the gym is again facing buildings and with no life, the entire property is a cold experience, it actually gave me the creeps. The service from start to end was horrific, there was so much pretension, no ALOHA as they used that word every step I took. 
As a world traveler and an avid hotelier I would not recommend this property to anyone and will never step foot there again, take your vacation to a true destination not some want-to-be hotel where everyone that worked there was miserable, fake, quick to take your money, NO ALOHA, Trump International Hotel is Waikiki is a major thumbs down, if you want a real escape The Royal Hawaiian Hotel is where its at!","Date of stay: April 2010","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_10"

Couldn't have been happier with our stay at Trump International as it had exactly what we we were looking for in a luxury hotel. It's only just opened and it looks it with the rooms ( we had two) in brand new condition. Not the place for a family resort type visit as pool is very small and there are no grounds or gardens. This is definitely a high rise hotel. Perfect for business trip or as in our case, SCUBA diving while my 86 year old mother enjoyed her beautiful standard room with a lovely partial ocean view from private lanai. We upgraded to ocean view and it was spectacular from 21st floor looking over park to Hilton Village lagoon. Beach is less than a block away and there are top-notch restaurants (Roy's , Ruth Chris, PF Changs and many more within 200 yards of downstairs lobby. Initial impression is understated as lobby is small and pool area is minimal. There was always plenty of room though and some pool side service. Staff service was spectacular with friendly staff leaving no stone unturned to please us. Examples include fresh fruit on arrival, inquiring phone calls as to our needs, printed directions delivered to our room immediately for our various travels and perfect dinner reservations. Concierges would not accept tips for their outstanding service. Last, but perhaps best , is BLT Restaurant on ground floor. Top dining experience in the islands and world-class cuisine.

It had 4 Plasma TV's and the kitchen was outfitted with top of the line everything (Wolf, Sub Zero etc).

There are so many hotels in Oahu, and it was difficult to make a decision about where to stay.  My husband, figuring since the Trump was only four months old, thought it would be the best bet.  Here’s a breakdown of what we encountered in our five day stay there:  

Hotel Inside: This hotel is only four months old, and it shows.  The rooms are nice and sparkling.  The décor in the rooms is fabulous.  The bathrooms and kitchenette counters are marble.  The beds are quite comfortable.  Our family stayed in a room with two double beds and a pullout sofa, which was convenient.  The bathroom was huge.  It had a double sink, shower and bath.  Lots of towels and bath products were available every day, since the maids clean the room in the morning/early afternoon, and refresh the towels at night.  The pool is a lap pool, and has a nice view of the ocean and city.  It is small, but very nice.  Depending on where you sit by the pool, you can choose whether or not you want to get sun.  There is poolside service, with a varied menu available for those that want to eat a snack or meal by the pool.   The configuration of the hotel is interesting.  The concierge and valets are on the ground floor, and the lobby/reception is on a different floor.  The layout in the hotel is so great, that only about 20% of the time we encountered someone in the elevator.  Even though the hotel was booked to capacity, they have the “people flow” well thought out.  It prevents a lot of people being crowded in one area. 

Hotel Outside:  We were about a three minute walk to the beach.  It was a very easy walk, with a crosswalk.  It is near the army museum.  The beach there is one of the most uncrowded stretches of beach in the area.  You can either set up a towel on the green grass in the park, which is roughly between the park and the hotel, or you can choose to set up on the beach.  The park is pretty.  There are a few food vendors directly off the beach, and a few hotels within a short walk for additional snacks/meals.  If you go out snorkeling- There are a few patches of large rocks that have colorful fish.  There is also a patch that is shallower, and has lots of sea urchins.  I saw a huge sea turtle on the last day there.  We drove to a well-known snorkeling beach for the day, and frankly I saw just as much in the ocean in front of the hotel.  When you stay at the Trump, consider stocking up on all your beach needs, such as umbrellas, snorkeling supplies, etc. at a local drug or convenience store, because it is all very expensive to rent on the beach.

Service:  The service is my favorite part of the hotel.  In general, I would say that the people in Hawaii are the nicest in the world.  The Trump must have employed the nicest people in the state.  My personal favorite person was Kawai, the Concierge.  The few times we had problems or questions, she led us in the right direction.  The valet staff and bellman were always so friendly and nice, and treated us professionally and warmly.  We thought they were so nice, that we brought them pastries when we returned from our trip to the bakery.  All the staff made us feel very, very special.  The room was always cleaned quite well.  The staff at the Trump is very on top of any problems.  One day my husband and I were surprised to see a 3 year old Japanese boy in the elevator by himself when we got in on the 9th floor.  We took him to the front desk.  Within one minute, the front desk clerk found a staff member who spoke Japanese to the boy, and calmed him down within seconds.  About two minutes after that, a big, handsome man who was head of security showed up.  Then, the mother wandered into the lobby a few minutes after.  The staff are trained professionals, who could probably have the capability of running a small company within a few days!  I look forward to staying at other Trump hotels when I visit other cities.

Trump Waikiki on Oahu, Hawaii was beyond expectation. A nice addition of Luxury in almost the heart of Waikiki, the Trump Waikiki is maintaining the Trump tradition of service, pampering, food and beyond. The Residences at Trump start at the Studio level to over the top 3 bedroom 2 story dream suites. I tried out ""Trump"" a few different ways on my stay there in February. I had to discover what it was like to sip champagne while soaking in the deep bathtub, with an oceanview, from my 1 bedroom suite :) And then I heard that little ""room service"" voice in my head, refusing to leave me alone until I called and ordered Eggs Benedict and fresh OJ. It's my preferred resort room service breakfast. Often times, when traveling with my best girlfriend Sue, we'll combine the champagne and eggs benedict for breakfast. Since I was traveling Solo and working hard to inspect all aspects of Trump Waikiki, I separated the two experiences. Well, it's difficult to drink champagne while soaking in the bathtub (with an oceanview) and eat eggs benedict!!! Speaking of bathtubs, I love the bathrooms at Trump. Groovy showers, deep tubs (only some units have ocean views from the bathtub), simple but elegant. And, as a bathrobe connoisseur,
I believe that Trump Waikiki has TRUMPED all others in Hawaii. Just so you have some insight about my bathrobe ""interests"", after the bellman has brought my things to the room, I head straight for the bathroom to see if the bathrobe is snugly, soft, luxurious..... so I know if I have something to look forward to later in the day. I do have one other hotel on Oahu whose's bathrobe might be tied for best. Maybe! At home, I usually wear ""logo"" bathrobes I have bought at places like Cousteau Fiji, Yasawa Island Resort and Qamea. But when I visit the resorts in Hawaii, I love the snuggle factor, soft to the touch, and good fit to enjoy while lounging in my air conditioned hotel room.

The beds are like sleeping on a cloud, delicious sheets and sweet dreams.

The Spa services are unique and pampering.  I enjoyed a facial which included
placing a multitude of lights over my face (I now look 10 years younger :).
Lacking a locker room, they give you extra time to bubble in the jacuzzi overlooking
Waikiki.  Complete thumbs up on this small but classy Spa!

The gourmet kitchen (all units have them) sparkled in my eyes with granite counters, Subzero refrigerators (all except the studios) and fantastic gidgets, gadgets and useful items that I might only dream of having in my kitchen at home. Although I only know how to cook a Caesar salad, when I dream about having a gourmet kitchen I also dream that I can cook! :)

There are so many things to talk about, but I'll leave you with 2 very important bits of information. The food at Wai'Olu oceanview bar was fun and frisky (mouthwatering) and the drink menu dazzled my libation gene. I have committed to return on a Friday night, to sample more Liquid Creations at Wai'Olu and watch the Friday Waikiki Fireworks. Last but not least, is how close the beach is to the Trump Waikiki. It's always a question in my mind since I am a sun goddess and I know that many of the clients of McCoy Travel come to Hawaii to enjoy the beach/sun. Trump provides you with a beach bag, towels and water and then you take a 5 minute walk to the beach where the ""beach concession"" has lounges/umbrellas for rent at a very very reasonable price. Waikiki Beach is NOT a quiet beach, it's very much about people watching, including surfers, stand up board surfers, hawaiian outrigger canoes, sailing catamarans and more. The ocean is 20 shades of blue, delightful to take a swim in.

That said, the Trump made us feel like royalty from the start.  Our first room was beautiful but faced into other hotels, so we were moved on the second day to a room with a sunset view over Fort DeRussy which is the best side.  The room had an interesting and thoughtful layout which was refreshing large, even for a studio.  Our kitchen was extremely well stocked with everything a gourmet cook would need. The bathroom was a huge spa-like space we loved and the robes were out of this world. They provided cool beach bags with cold water and fruit for outings to the beach. The mattress was an incredible pillowtop that we didn't want to leave.
On the negative side the TV system was extremely slow and cumbersome. Also, the sliding glass door to the balcony was so heavy we thought we actually pulled tendons in our wrists trying to open it.  The infinitity pool was beautiful but tiny, the spa and room services were overpriced. The restaurants were extremely expensive so we opted to eat elsewhere or cook in our room.

The hotel is a short walk from the beach, and I mean a very short walk. You just cross the street from the hotel and the beach is like 50 ft. away through some green space.  I was on the beach everyday and the proximity was a big surprise because looking on a map, it seemed a lot further.

Also nearby are the shops and malls, and also plenty of restaurants to choose from.  For a first time visit to Hawaii, it did not take much effort to find what I needed.

I tried the spa and found it pricey for the experience that I got.

The arrival went well, since we arrived later in the afternoon our room was already ready – even with some nice honeymoon amenities.  Our room was beautiful- a nice contemporary feel.  Pool is nice, but a bit small for 400+ rooms.  The beach bags they loan you are great and very convenient.  If you are going to the royal palace, call the concierge desk to arrange as they get a discount off the normal rate.  The new BLT restaurant was great, dinner service was a bit long for my liking but overall service and food was good.  Nightly parking is $28 so if you are not planning on using your car everyday I would only rent for the days that you are going to use it.  If you are visiting during the Winter Season, visit the North Shore. The waves were absolutely amazing!  

The only irritant was prior to arrival we had asked the attaché to arrange a few dinner reservations for us.  I waited over a week with no email or follow up call so after not hearing back from them, I called the concierge desk to see if they could help me.  The concierge assisted me right away to confirm everything and sent an email confirmation within minutes.  Sounds small, but when you are traveling to Hawaii during the holidays I would recommend to have all your dining set prior—lots of the popular restaurants can fill quickly.  Not sure what the difference between the two departments is (pre arrival vs. post arrival?)  only that we had more interaction with the concierge than the attaché.  I would suggest calling concierge if you need to get something done.

The hotel staff and facilities were unbelievable and the only area that he coudn't go was completely inside the spa for services!!! They treated him like a guest on his on his own and would recommend anyone with small children to consider this hotel as an option! They don't have the typical ""playground"" area for kids but the beach is a stone's throw away so it's not necessary!","Date of stay: December 2009","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The check-in was quick but the room wasn't ready and we were given a free upgrade from a beachwalk to the ocean view studio. Which we thought was a nice gesture. 

We had lunch at the the only restaurant serving and the staff pulled out a kids menu at the odd hour we were there. And one last thing, although not sure how important this really is if this were true - we heard from the other guests that this is not really owned by Trump and that Trump just licensed his name for the hotel operations.

The ocean view from the room is nice and the lanai though wasn't spacious it was decently sized with a table and two comfy chairs. We realized the view would have been depressing from the lower floors if we had gotten the ""beachwalk studio"". The beachwalk in the marketing is a bit misleading. The ""beachwalk"" is the Beachwalk road behind the hotel and has nothing to do with either a beach or walking on beach. 

We also realized the room is too small for a family with two kids since there isn't much room left to maneuver around once we opened up the queen sofa bed. 

The kitchen is well stocked with all the high end appliances and the bath was extra spacious and marbled floors and walls. 

The hotel staff were always friendly, courteous and made us feel really special while we were there. The otherwise helpful and informative concierge sent us to two restaurants for lunch and to our surprise we found both the places closed for lunch. We were more than a little annoyed to have this happen twice and our kids didn't let us asking the concierge for any more advice on food tips after the two incidents after that! Not really sure why the staff isn't up to date on restaurant business hours. There were otherwise very helpful, friendly and patient though. Some nice touches include making sure your car is stocked with water bottles whenever you left the hotel, and free children's books and toys during the first and the last days for the kids.

Also, for those with cars there is a $30/day fee for parking. Something you may want to consider when renting a car while you are staying at the hotel (but most hotels in this area perhaps have a parking fee as well).","Date of stay: December 2009","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

Amazing Honeymoon!","My wife and I stayed here for our honeymoon from 11/29-12/5 and it was beyond amazing. This was our first time staying at a Trump property and it was simply amazing. The property is ultra-luxurious with very modern amenities. The staff is very helpful. We received a complimentary upgrade to a 2 bedroom, 3 bathroom Trump suite with oceanview and my wife and I could not stop admiring the room. It was so nice we never wanted to leave! The rooms were huge with amazing, modern bathrooms. We had a designer kitchen, living room, sitting room, 2 bedrooms and 3 full bathrooms. The master bath was so large you could practically live in it. Every night, the staff left us a special token (chocolate covered strawberries, champagne, etc..).   We will definitely be returning here!
We also used the Trump spa which was pricey but wonderful for a couples massage.
Make sure you check out the nice Infinity pool on the 6th floor. 
It's in a wonderful location in Waikiki with everything in walking distance - we hardly needed our car.
This is the first online review I've ever written for anything and it's simply because I cannot tell you how wonderful this property is. If I had the money, I'd buy a unit here!

The personal attention & service was excellent.. The staff is the friendliest people we have ever met. Because we were celebrating a special anniversary, we were given an amazing upgrade. The one-bedroom suite is awesome; large rooms, airy, and beautifully decorated. His & her velour bathrobes and slippers.The hotel is first class. Wonderful beds, large flat screen TVs, a full ultra modern kitchen, all with top name appliances. Great soaking tub and the best shower! We enjoyed the lovely infinity pool and hot tub. We were able to view the magnificent sunset there. The beach was a short block away. Great beach totes daily filled with luxurious towels, cold water bottles and fruit. We used the complimentary computer in the library.  Beautiful, exotic floral arrangements throughout the public areas.

The hotel was not what I thought.  The website portrays it to be much nicer and appealing than it is live.  For one thing, the pool is small and the view is horrible...it faces the buildings, not the beach....and it is very windy due to the location.  I felt like I was in a downtown apartment, not a luxury resort in Hawaii.... You think an infinity pool would face the ocean, like the sheraton's, which is SO INCREDIBLE, compared to the Trump's.  Also, there is no action at the Trump....no live music, no bars, and only one restaurant was serving.....and even if they wanted to have all this, there is no room for it....small community area....and our room was so small and badly designed, which made it look even smaller....I felt depressed when I walked into our room, not excited....my expectations were not met, and they were built up due to seeing the website.  The bathroom was much smaller, and the room was not open and big like it looks online.  I thought the hotel was situated directly on the beach, especially after calling and the agent at the hotel verbally telling me that I did not have to cross the street.....that was a lie.....you had to cross the street and walk a few minutes, and the beach was horrible......down the street and on the ocean is a much better resort, beach, and pool.....THE SHERATON.....go there and save money, because it is cheaper and nicer, a win win!  I only lasted one night at the Trump, and immediately switched to Sheraton Waikiki when I walked over and saw what I was missing....Sorry for the bad review, but I just could not believe this place is five star.....just didn't feel like vacation or hawaiin....felt like I was staying in an average hotel in downtown san diego....just not that exciting.....one plus was that they had alot of employees, and they were friendly and very good.....so a plus for the staff and service!","Date of stay: December 2009","Trip type: Traveled on business","ui_bubble_rating bubble_10"

Upon check in, you are greeted with beads and several genuine ALOHA's, then taken to the lobby which is located on the 6th floor, the decor is stunning throughout the hotel, and the rooms are extremely large compared to other hotels in waikiki. They automatically upgraded us to cityoceanaview since it was available. The kitchen had everything we needed including a shaker for our martinis. The beds are extremely comfortable if u like soft pillowtops.. We asked for a late check out on that day since our flight was in the evening and they immediately granted it. The service was exceptional. short 5 minute walk to the beach and shopping.  Denny's is around the corner and eggs and things is up the block for inexpensive breakfast.. Public transportation and park is right across from hotel. This will now be my hotel choice in Waikiki.. only downfall was that restaurant wasn't open yet.. and also because of that they did a test firedrill early AM working on the vents. Bummer.

On arrival the staff was very attentive and escorted us right away to the 6th floor lobby.  The rooms are beautiful-- equipped with the top of the line appliances.  We didn't get to dine at the restaurant due to the rain. (it's open air)  I hope that management rectifies that glitch as I'm sure guests will enjoy the ambiance of eating out doors.  We also thought that BLT Restaurant would be open, but they are scheduled to open in mid December.  We really liked the beach bags that we picked up each morning to take to the beach; it’s a really nice touch as the hotel is just across the street from the beach.  Overall the most impressive by far were the employees who were all very courteous and genuinely very happy to be of service.  From the housekeepers to the concierge to room service, each employee that we had interactions with made you feel welcomed.  Although I’m sure that there are challenges with any new hotel, this one seems to be headed in the right direction.  Hopefully we’ll make it back in the next year or two to stay here again.","Date of stay: November 2009","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Super friendly staff, from the moment you get there until the moment you leave everybody treats you with respect and professionalism (courteous but not imposing). You can see glamour even from a mile away: nice and fast elevators, great lobby area, infinity pool (a bit on the smaller side but that didn’t bother me) and great touches everywhere (nothing tacky). The gym is a good size and we liked the fact that they offer natural flavored water with different flavors every day. They also have touchable screen monitors on every cardio machine which is a great way to watch a game while you are exercising. The room itself was great. We stayed at a studio and it had everything we needed and more. It had a small kitchen with very nice appliances that we didn’t use at all. I don’t know who cooks while on vacation but that definitely won’t be me. I really like the fact that it had a small refrigerator with nothing in it so I could store cold drinks. Even with all the rain and cloudy days, it does get warm in Hawaii. The bathroom was huge and I liked the open concept they have going on. I took a bath in the deep tub and it was fantastic, white marble with double vanity – very nice touch. We also loved the tote bag they provide with towels, water and fresh fruit that now I want to buy one exactly.  It came really handy at the beach and when we snorkeled. We were on the lower floors with a nice view of the park in front and the beach, a bit noisy from the side street but it’s Waikiki after all. If you want peace and quiet I’d suggest to go to another island, Lanai comes to mind. To me the location was great, we could walk to the main drag on Waikiki and we could drive in and out of the property pretty quickly. 
 I will strongly recommend crossing the street and having b-fast at Orchids (Kalehulani), they have some killer pancakes with blueberries and their prices were very reasonable, especially for the view you get. We also went to Eggs’n Things and we thought that it was a bit overrated. The food was good but nothing to brag about, you also have to wait a long time (unless you go reallyyyyy early) and the service is always on a hurry. All in all, we wish we could afford the Trump once they have their grand-opening so we can come back again. We got a really good deal because of the soft-opening.  Oh, did I mention the very nice bed and the huge flat screen t.v.? Well done Mr. Trump… but I’m pretty sure the credit goes to his daughter Ivanka.","Date of stay: November 2009","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Maybe......","My husband and I stayed at the Trump Waikiki for 5 nights in November over Thanksgiving.  The hotel is about 1/2 block from the beach but a little bit of a walk to the real busy part of Waikiki Beach but close to shops and the Waikiki Beach Walk.  Upon arrival we were taken to the lobby which is on the 6th floor and open with a gorgeous view.  We were greeted with cool water and towels to freshen up before getting our keys and going to our room.  We were surprised that we had been complementarily upgraded from a mountain view to a water view.  It was a special occasion and the hotel left a bottle of champagne and a piece of birthday cake which was a very lovely touch.  The staff is very attentive and tries very hard to accommodate your every wish. They are very friendly, however, their questioning of ""what did you do today"" is a bit inappropriate for someone who likes their privacy and could be phrased differently so that the guest volunteers what they did and is not put on the spot so directly.  The room was nicely appointed with modern furnishings, white carpeting, large flat screen t.v., couch, chair, desk, gourmet kitchenette with granite countertops, microwave, induction stovetop; all white marble bathroom with an open shower, large soaking tub and double marble vanity.   To my tastes the bed was uncomfortably soft to the point that I slept on the sofa one night just to get some sleep.  There is free WiFi and a small gym and a spa in the hotel.  I think one restaurant is open.  However, some things need to be ironed out before the ""real"" opening.  We had hoped to have some meals (at least breakfast) in the room, but there are no dishes, silverware, pots or pans, dish soap or sponge to clean up in the kitchen. We were told they had not arrived from the mainland so we had to buy some things in order to even microwave some coffee.  Eventually, though, some utensils and a pot were supplied. Housekeeping was a bit scattered (no spare toilet paper-- had to ask on the 2nd day for more); one day a fluffy bath mat appeared, but never reappeared after that; on the 3rd day a makeup mirror appeared(?); newspapers left in the room for days; kitchen garbage not taken out.  Also, there was no waiter service at the pool and we had to ask that the dirty towels and tables be cleaned up as they were a bit sticky after people had left.  No one ever came around to ask if we wanted a drink at the pool, which I'd expect at a luxury hotel at least every hour on the hour.  To access the infinity pool (which is not very large) you have to go through the main lobby (no side elevators).   Also, there are two elevated grates in the bottom of the pool near the far wall which are dangerous (I caught my foot in one and my toe is still hurting a week later).  Something should be put there to warn of them as a child could get caught easily in them.  A nice touch is the beach bag which the hotel loans you with towels, water and a fruit snack; we were told we had to return the bag each day but I did notice someone checking out carrying one.  Also the beach chair rental program is a bit confused; the hotel said the chairs could be rented and charged to your room but the man on the beach said he didn't have any arrangement for payment from the hotel.  I noticed the shell leis at the valet desk and only when I asked I was I told ""you should have gotten one at check-in"" (we didn't).  On checkout we wanted help with the luggage, but the valet did not answer the phone and we had to carry the luggage downstairs ourselves to find several staff at the valet desk--not acceptable.  I don't want to sound nit-picky here, but if you are a luxury property, all these little things should happen or not happen (depending) without the guest having to ask for them.  Simply having high end finishes and countertops doesn't make a luxury hotel, the total experience does.  Hopefully in time, the hotel will learn what guests of a luxury property expect and then it will be a great place to stay.","Date of stay: November 2009","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"
