839831881,50,Absolutely perfect!,"Both my husband and I were delighted we picked the Lilikoi Inn for our Kona stay. Trina and Shai were fabulous hosts, from the delish breakfast Shai made for us to the morning visits around the table on their beautiful lanai. They are also extremely knowledgeable about the island and were a great help plan our daily excursions.    We had a large and beautiful suite complete with a great tub and separate shower. The grounds are gorgeous too, you can even see the ocean from the lanai deck. I thought the price was extremely fair as it also included a huge fresh breakfast each day. To top it off, it's not far from the airport either.    If you are lucky enough to find an open room at the Lilikoi, grab it! :)",May 2022,March 2022,,,California

Treated each morning to a delicious and hearty breakfast served on the lanai overlooking the Kona coast. Nothing was missing and so many thoughtful touches were included in our room.

Trina and Shai are wonderful hosts. The room was clean, tidy and had everything we needed. The home cooked breakfast made by Shai was amazing.

822509473,50,Wonderful stay with Trina & Shai at Lilikoi Inn,"My partner and I stayed at Lilikoi Inn bed and breakfast hosted by Trina and Shai for five nights. Our highlights were the clean and spacious room with comfortable bed, beautiful ocean view from the balconies and absolutely incredible homemade breakfasts made by Chef Shai every morning.

819708075,50,A Very Nice Place to Stay!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Lilikoin Inn! Shai's breakfast was the best - we had fritata's for the first day, and open face burrito's the second.    You also get fresh fruit and coffee/juice with breakfast, and we usually end up skipping lunch after the big breakfast, super good for a day full of activities!    The best travel advice came from the hosts too! They know the area well and will recommend things to you that's just right for how active you want to be. We went on the Captain Cook's Monument Trail and it was the best activity we did all week on the island!    We stayed at the green papaya room, which is downstairs. The room is spacious and clean, and we were not bothered by the frogs and crickets outside at night.    The hosts were so friendly and nice and went out of their way to help us out! We bought fresh fruits from the market and they helped preparing them for our later road trip.    If you are considering booking here, couple things to know before you do:    1. the driveway is STEEP, be prepared especially if you arrive at night  2. you are on a tropical island, so yes there will be frogs and crickets chiming outside all night - it's a perfect white noise for falling asleep though  3. breakfast is served at 8am every morning  4. there is no AC, like most of the B&Bs on the island, but the temperature is comfortable at night  5. make sure you close the screen door/actual door upon entry/leave, so no animals/insects get into your room unexpectedly  6. we didn't use the hot tub when we visited, can't speak to the conditions  7. no shoes in the house  8. expect to interact with the hosts and other guests at breakfast! It's really fun!  9. cats/dogs/chickens are running around - be aware if you are allergic  10. JUST DO IT - Shai and Trina are wonderful people and this place is well taken care of, location is also great for traveling to central parts of Kona.",Nov 2021,November 2021,,,
819002390,50,None,Beautiful B&B run by beautiful People. Shai and Trina were wonderful hosts and Shai cooked excellent breakfasts using food mostly sourced from his property.

817448860,20,"Read the reviews, including the bad ones - I should have, and then I wouldn't have booked here :(","Typically I use the overall rating and a skim read through the reviews, both good and bad, to decide on booking a place. I apparently didn't read the bad reviews on the Lilikoi Inn, because when I read them while there they summed up our experience :( The rest of our trip we were at airbnbs that cost $60 - $100/night and they were all much better than this dump. For us $200/night is a treat and the place should be nice!!  See my pictures. The public/shared areas of this place are filthy. I have a fairly high tolerance for some grunge, but it's truly gross. All the light fixtures are encased in dust, spider webs and spiders (dead and alive). My picture of a light fixture is the one directly over the sink and clean dishes rack.  ""Guest Kitchen"" is advertised as being well equipped - there are inordinate amounts of tableware - but I couldn't find a single pan. Let's consider the tableware - I had to dig through the silverware to find a fork that didn't have remnants of food on it. Likewise the plates. However we did receive a lecture about being sure to do our own dishes immediately so Trina (owner) ""doesn't have to deal with them"". When my spouse was doing our dishes in the evening, she brought hers out and put them in the sink next to him and said ""I'll do those in the morning"".    One of the reasons we selected this place was the hot tub - it was our plan for our final evening in Hawai'i. When we asked to see it while checking in we were told in a manner that was both dismissive and unapologetic that it wasn't working. We also were regaled with a ""poor me"" story about having to wait ""weeks"" for someone to fix it. When wandering the grounds later I came across the hot tub - it clearly hasn't been used in a very long time. See picture - not pictured are the broken steps up to the platform the tub is on. It clearly hasn't been in use for many months - and if someone came to work on it they wouldn't be able to because it is full of and surrounded by junk. The website and description should be updated to reflect there isn't a hot tub.    When checking in I asked Trina if they could prepare a breakfast to-go as we had to leave at 5:30am. The reply was admonishment about not disturbing them or the other guests, and a lengthy monologue describing ways to be quiet. There wasn't really an answer about breakfast at that time - but later I was gifted another speech about the fact that we had ""lots of food in the fridge"" and ""can't you just make a cheese sandwich?"". * see mitigating factors.  Trina reiterated about being quiet in the early morning another couple of times - but then their dogs barked at length several times during the night, which completely disrupted our sleep.    Talking of dogs - one of the other negative reviews mentions that they feed their pets in the ""commercial kitchen"" - which they deny in ALL CAPS in their response. I witnessed her feeding the pets in the commercial kitchen, and then leaving the dirty dishes on the floor until the next feeding.    Mitigating factors:  The location is ideal for spending a day or two near the touristy center of Kailua/Kona without being in the thick of it.  It's fun to drive up the hill and be perched above the beaches and town. The elevation provides slightly cooler temperatures which is nice for sleeping.  The lanai is a lovely hang out spot, we enjoyed watching the sunset.  Later Shai came and told us he was making us a to-go breakfast and it was nice to eat that at the airport.",Nov 2021,October 2021,,the rooms are fine - the rest of the place sucks and is filthy,"Homer, Alaska"
815224139,50,Excellent B&B on Big Island; best lanai in Hawaii,"We were well looked after throughout our 3-night stay with Shai & Trina. Highlights were Shai's welcome smoothie (all natural fruit) and homemade breakfasts and Trina's entertaining conversation and sightseeing advice. We have traveled extensively throughout the Hawaiian Islands and there was nothing comparable to having a beer on Lilikoi's one-of-a-kind lanai with fantastic views over Kona and the Pacific Ocean. We would recommend this excellent B&B to other travelers seeking a more natural Hawaiian experience, far away from the touristy resorts on the coast. Thank you Shai & Trina for a memorable stay!",Oct 2021,October 2021,,,"Palo Alto, California"
813766836,50,Serene,"This was the perfect beginning to our 12 day stay on the Big Island. The inn is actually a small farm with chickens, banana and papaya trees, coffee plants, and tropical flowers. It is nestled high on a hill overlooking the ocean and Kona, providing beautiful views and sunsets. We got in late afternoon and Shai greeted us with a refreshing smoothie on the lanai. Trina gave us several suggestions for dinner, one of which was a delicious Thai Take-out which we brought back to eat on the lanai. Breakfast was beyond compare. Please give Shai free rein to fix whatever he desires. He will amaze you! We have never had such delicious breakfasts.    Trina was a font of information about the Island and thanks to her we found a hidden cove with a white sand beach, perfect for swimming and snorkeling, as well as some other great beaches and sights.    There are some negative reviews, and I feel like I should address those.  First, it is a steep and narrow, and at night, dark drive up to the Inn. Our rental car did scrape at the bottom until we got the hang of it. Second, the accommodations, though spacious and comfortable, are not luxurious. There is no air-conditioning, but at least when we were there, there was no need for it. I loved the fresh air coming in and the sound of the night critters lulled me to sleep.    I wish we could have spent more time there. It was close to Kona, but away from the bustle, an ideal place to come back to after a busy day exploring.",Oct 2021,September 2021,,,
810471380,50,They went above and beyond,"This is such a hard time to travel. The owners went above and beyond to meet our every need. They were so careful to make us feel comfortable in these strange times.  On top of that the food was delicious and the room and house felt like we were living on a patch of paradise. They offered advice on what we wanted to do, and didn't mind when we kept changing our mind on what we wanted. I hope to come back and visit again very soon.",Sep 2021,August 2021,,Every room seemed special.,

810143638,20,Don’t expect cleanliness!,Great food. Inexcusable filth! Common kitchen was a nightmare of cobwebs and pet hair. Shared fridge was way overdue for a cleaning.  Special requests were met with bewilderment and opposition. Parking was a free for all muddy lot. Located on a west facing slope with great sunsets.

808807242,50,Exceeds expectations!,"My partner and I were blown away by the gorgeous grounds, delicious meals, and hospitality at the Lilikoi Inn. The rooms and lanai are surrounded by lush foliage and beautiful views to the ocean (and the occasional chicken and cat ambling through). Breakfast is different each day, and always very tasty, nutritious, and filling. We really enjoyed getting to stay with Shai and Trina and would definitely recommend the Inn to all!",Sep 2021,September 2021,,,
808582179,50,Optimal Unparalleled Hidden Gem,"An optimal experience. Having researched many, we had spent time in a few accomodations across the big island, and discovered that they tend to invest their energy in either the outdoor experience (e.g., a nice lanai overlooking Kawaihae bay but small quarters) or the indoor experience (e.g., a nicely appointed house by Hilo, but otherwise nondescript). Lilikoi Inn strikes that rare perfect balance between the two, without compromising on either for the price range. On the one hand, theirs is a serene and gorgeous lanai overlooking the coast and a lush garden with tropical flora galore, where at night we could hear the gentle song of coqui frogs. On the other hand, their generous and private living space (we stayed in the Plumeria room) provided us with everything that we required, while the open common area served for distanced socializing and really the best crafted food we have had on the island. Shai and Trina were the most gracious of hosts and were genuinely happy to have us. Our only regret is not being able to stay longer, but we will definitely be back.",Sep 2021,August 2021,Traveled as a couple,,
807828650,50,An Ideal Setting with Incredible Food,"Shai and Trina's bed and breakfast is nestled in a tropical forest paradise with dramatic ocean views and the best food we've had on the island--seriously--we visited about 30 different top-rated restaurants on Yelp on the Big Island and Shai's food makes a stay at his bed & breakfast worth it in and of itself. He is a trained chef with decades of experience and it shows. Shai and Trina were so welcoming that we felt we were staying with family; their warmth was sincere and we felt a little sad when we left. We look forward to staying here again ext time we visit the Big Island, but next time we will be sure to stay longer.    Covid tip: we felt really comfortable staying here during Covid. The rooms are accessible from the patio and each have a private bath. Breakfast is served outside on a huge table allowing for social distancing. The living room and kitchen area (available for guest use) is in an open space with double doors that are always open, allowing the natural trade winds to flow through the room. I wouldn't hesitate staying here during the pandemic, and this is coming from someone who is risk-averse during Covid.",Sep 2021,August 2021,,,"Albuquerque, New Mexico"

We were met and welcomed by Trina who showed us to our nicely prepared room with plenty of space for our two kids. Our kids enjoyed feeding the chickens and playing with the dogs and cats on property. The food was exceptional, including refreshing smoothies upon arrival and gourmet breakfasts each morning. I am an early rising travel duck and loved sitting watching the incredible view in the mornings. Shai brought a tray of Kona coffee to me each morning before breakfast while I waited for my sleepy family to wake up. And we were just a short drive from Kona, coffee plantations, beaches and great restaurants. In the evenings, sit and watch the sunset while drinking a glass of wine. Can we go back now?!!

799202624,50,"Hospitable hosts, beautiful B&B","We stayed at the Lillikoi Inn for our entire week in Hawaii -- it was a homey, generous experience thanks to our hosts. The property is an active farm with many fruit trees in sight of the lanai and dogs, cats, chickens -- all of which are charming and none of which are bothersome. Shai has culinary training, and this shows from the beginning with his welcome fruit smoothies for new guests. We stayed in the Lillikoi Room, which is on the top level of the main lanai. It was nicely decorated, clean, roomy. The rooms do not have AC but have powerful fans. Any needs were promptly / easily addressed thanks to our hosts, and we made good use of Trini and Shai's tips for what to do in addition to our agendas for the day. Breakfasts were amazing meals that could be enjoyed in view of the beach on the lanai or packaged with advance warning, making sure we were taken care of all day. (As vegetarians, this was particularly great and appreciated.) The Inn is 15 mins outside of Kona in the Cloud Forest area and this made it very easy to see nearby sights without getting stuck in Kona traffic. Our experience would not have been as enjoyable without the Lillikoi as home base.",Jul 2021,July 2021,,,

My friend and I were greeted with a delicious smoothie made with fruit grown right on the property. Each morning, breakfast was both delicious and a work of he(art). I enjoyed getting to know the other guests, part of the homey atmosphere, as well as the beautiful scenery. My bed was very comfortable, there were enough hangers to hang up each of outfits I bought, probably a few too many, but there was plenty of room to see what I brought which made me feel like I was at home. I loved the art in my room! The room is large and has both a comfy chair and a desk, there was a TV I never turned on. A chorus of frogs sang me to sleep.

If you’re looking for an authentic non-touristic Hawaiian experience this is the place for you. Proprietors Shai and Trina (and their dogs, cats, and chickens) will greet you. No need for a room key - you’re part of the family at the Lilikoi. The rooms are cozy, comfortable & quiet with WiFi and tv if you want that.

Take off for the day - Shai and Trina can provide directions to funky local towns, hiking spots or beaches, and can lend you beach chairs/masks/snorkels for the day.

The inn is nestled in a steep maze of fruit trees off the main highway, and three cats parade breakfast every morning--Romeo, Juliet, and Mac Yerlick. I will remember best Shai's admirable dedication to his craft--he cooked for us every morning with care and attention to detail, using ingredients that came from the very grounds we stood on. Trina's stories completed every meal. From the outlook, patient blues swallow Kona in the distance, where ocean meets sky and neither can decide where to begin or end. Geckos play hide and seek along the perimeter of a quiet paradise, reminiscent of a home I've never been to before. It was a delight to end our stay in Hawai'i here.

No regrets! In fact, I extended my stay. Once through the stress and rigamarole of testing before boarding my west-bound flight, I was happy to receive another COVID test upon arrival at Kona International. After that, I felt relieved to continue with safety recommendations, such as masking, being shared throughout the island. That is, at Lilikoi Inn and most everywhere else I went around the Big Island, I felt very safe from both contracting or spreading disease. Lilikoi Inn is very spacious and airy with most shared space being outdoors. Shai and Trina are limiting the number of guests, performing elevated cleaning protocols, and it was great to find parking and no crowds at my favorite beaches!

738785374,10,Disappointed,"Our booking wasn’t properly handled. After making reservations 5 months in advance and paying a deposit, the owners claimed no knowledge. However they were able to accommodate us for two nights. Unfortunately there were no amenities in the room. No microwave, no refrigerator, no coffee pot. Before entering the room we were asked to always remove our shoes. Floors were disgustingly dirty as was the bathroom and shower. Woke up with a cat sleeping in our room because interior door did not latch. Cat hairs all over outdoor furniture chair pads. Breakfast was excellent and Shai was extremely informative and cordial. However his wife Trina seemed to be self-centered and overbearing. We were unable to have a nice conversation with the other guests because she kept interrupting.

The lanai was a beautiful setting to start the day enjoying Shai's gourmet breakfasts with 100% Kona coffee, and also a relaxing spot in the evening for sunset with a glass of wine.Every morning Shai and Trina provided us with recommendations and directions for places to go and restaurants. Shai made a point of telling us to take his cell # in case we needed any further help finding places as we explored. The guest kitchen has everything you might need and also had a tray of fresh tropical fruits and avocados that all guests are welcome to eat.

716498176,30,Not for people with cat allergies...,"While the property is super cute, we were not in love with our stay here.    The listing doesn't mention that there are cats here that hang out in the main areas. My fiance is super allergic to cats and we would normally not stay somewhere with them on the premisis. Given that you cant take food or alcohol into the rooms, this means you cant really hide out from the cats while eating or drinking. The hosts should definitely mention an allergy warning. The website does mention the dog but not the cat.    We stayed in the green papaya room which was downstairs and a bit more private which we liked. The room was clean and spacious. There seemed to be a shared door with the next room that wasn't a full door? That was a bit weird.    Shai is kind hearted and a good chef. His wife is a bit aggressive in her speech and interrupts people a lot which I think was offputting to guests (not just us).    Also this is not a spot for the introverted. I've been to bed and breakfasts before where the hosts can tell if you're in the mood to be social or not...not an option here.    The other thing that bothers me is the way they've responded to other negative reviews here on trip advisor and/or booking.com. They are very dismissive of complaints. I understand some guests are probably unreasonable, but to respond only by saying ""well all my other good reviews say otherwise"" comes off as a bit childish.    Overall the place is cute, clean, and in a cool location. It just wasn't our vibe and the cat thing was a big disappointment.",Oct 2019,October 2019,Traveled as a couple,,

698904565,50,A place to stay to experience the Kona coast.,"The Lillikoi Inn is a small bed and breakfast nestled on the hillsides above the Kona coast, about a 10 minute drive from Kailua-Kona. It is a small coffee plantation where the proprietors also host guests. You see the coffee trees and you drink the coffee harvested from the trees. You are basically as close to nature as you can be, with all of the animal sounds, giant rainforest plants, and other Hawaiian experiences, and still be comfortably indoors in a rainforest. The view from the Lanai is unbeatable. If this sounds good, then Lillikoi Inn is the place for you. If you need to be able to get away from this, with climate control and absolute quiet, then probably its not the place for you, and probably a more conventional hotel or resort is your best bet. My wife and I went to Hawaii to experience it, and I think this is an excellent place for that purpose.    Trina and Shai Yerlick are cordial hosts. We were greeted when we arrived with Smoothies freshly prepared by Shai. Shai also prepares breakfast, which is going to be much better than you can likely get almost anywhere else, for example delicious yogurt blends and frittatas. He will also help you plan your day of exploration of the island. The couple also have entertaining stories. :) We went snorkeling three times, twice at ""two-step"" near Captain Cook (ask Shai). They will help you find this, and also loan you snorkels.    Other things to know: there are plenty of critters. Keep the food in your room in tupperware containers, especially if the packages are opened, so it does not attract ants. Also, there are mosquitoes on the Lanai as in most wet places on the island. Maybe consider bringing light, covering clothing (like a thin long sleeved shirt) to wear on the Lanai if you want to relax on the Lanai and not be bothered by them.",Aug 2019,July 2019,,Lillikoi room is very comfortable and (relatively) accessible.,

Shai whips up the absolute best food, and the conversations over breakfast were hysterical and fun. Shai and Trina always made sure that our plans were optimal, and suggested some truly beautiful options that we never would have found otherwise.    The location is great, too. You are close enough to Kona to enjoy the restaurants and the nightlife, but far enough away from the tourist scene to ensure that your peace and quiet remains undisturbed.

On day 2 I had an early flight and Shai was so kind to brew me coffee overnight. Friendly hosts and a property surrounded by nature.  A few things to note :  - The drive up the property is quite steep. Make sure that you rent a 4 WD if you're going there. My coupe did ok but if I had known about this I would've rented differently  -This place is REALLY in the middle of nature. So if you're put off by bugs, geckos frogs or other such creatures maybe you're a resort person and you should choose accordingly. They're not in the rooms (which are sparkling clean btw) thankfully  -The frogs hold an all night chortling concert. If their music isn't your thing bring earplugs  -The rooms don't have AC(at least mine didn't) While it is quite cool up on the hill you may feel a bit sticky due to the humidity. Again if that's your deal choose a resort.    Bottom line - if you're expecting resort like amenities go elsewhere.

If there was ever heaven on Earth or a garden of Eden I'm thrilled to say that me and countless others have found them both at the Lilikoi Inn. Your hosts Shai and Trina are two truly radiant individuals, both beaming with Aloha, stories, and knowledge about the big island and life.

The views and sunsets are seriously some of the greatest that I believe our Earth has to offer. Sitting on the lanai at breakfast and staring at the glowing coffee field spread out before you while drinking an indescribably delicious cup of Kona coffee that came from those very fields is something that is better experienced than explained. Once again the fruits and the meals prepared by Shai are on par if not better than a 5 star restaurant because of the personal touch and attention, you can literally taste warmth and passion in every bite.

680593210,50,Amazing and memorable experience at the Lilikoi Inn,"Truly, a hidden gem! My husband and I found this place after reading a few blogs and then saw the highly rated reviews on pretty much every travel booking site (TripAdvisor, Google, Yelp...). We undoubtedly agree with every positive review that's been posted. We've stayed at hotels, AirBnBs, B&B...and nothing beats the Lilikoi Inn. Spectacular views, beautiful and lush property, fresh and delectable homemade meals, great location and the most hospitable hosts! Without any hesitation, we would HIGHLY suggest staying at the Lilikoi Inn. Don't think about it, just book your stay here! You won't be disappointed.    Shai and Trina are two amazing individuals and the most warm, generous, genuine, humble and sweet couple. Upon arrival, we were greeted with a cold, fresh smooth made from homegrown fruits and the most tasty and savory eggplant on toast. Afterwards, we were shown to our room and the common areas. We stayed in the Plumeria room and it was very clean and spacious (it's much bigger than your average hotel room). The bed is comfy and we slept well! We loved hearing the sounds of nature rather than cars driving by at any time of the day. Very peaceful. Everything about this lovely property speaks Hawaiian.    Breakfasts are absolutely devine. They are conscious of any dietary restrictions/allergies (a huge plus!). Be sure to wake up and get out of bed to make it to Shai's homemade breakfasts. We are from the Bay Area and love to eat/explore all types of foods/cuisines. However, we've never had meals like Shai's. Truly unique, flavorful, fresh, well presented, and down right good! Come hungry because your belly will be full by the end of it! You can definitely tell he is a professional chef! Each morning, our breakfasts started off with a papaya boat filled with delicious fruit/yogurt and juice. Second breakfast course is a savory dish. Each morning, we had a different breakfast and EVERY SINGLE DISH was scrumptious. Not to mention, their delicious, homegrown Kona coffee! What get's better than this? We had originally planned to eat out for breakfasts, but Shai's food was too good, we wanted to enjoy the morning breakfasts on the lanai at the Lilikoi Inn. Hands down, Lilikoi Inn breakfasts are tastier than the typical restaurants breakfast on the island. We loved that Shai and Trina sat with us for breakfasts. A couple days, I headed up for breakfast first (my husband was working) and Trina was there and kept me company. My husband and I felt very much like family rather than guests from the moment we arrived to our very last day there. Conversations with them are very natural and fun! We'd also suggest buying their yummy coffee beans to enjoy when you get back home from vacation. Support local!    The common areas are clean and also cleaned daily. They have a full kitchen that guests are welcome to use. The fur babies are all VERY calm and sweet. The property is absolutely breathtaking. Instead of going out, we spent a few nights eating our dinner on the lanai watching the sunset. Highly suggest you spend at LEAST one night watching the sunset from their lanai. During the day, I enjoyed sitting on the lanai reading and taking in the views.    Before our trip to BI, we had specific places we wanted to explore (that were highly rated). Some were good/mediocre, but we ended up going to places suggested by Trina and Shai instead, and are so thankful we did. If you are looking for places to explore (food or activities), ask them! What I appreciate most is that they asked what our energy level is to help gauge what type of activity to suggest. For example, I'm pregnant and was worried about rough ocean water, so they made awesome suggestions on beaches/hikes/hidden gems to check out that were perfect for us! They are very detailed in giving you advice/directions so you don't get lost! =)    On our last day at the Lilikoi Inn, Shai packed us some fresh bananas and avocado grown on their property. Delicious! My husband and I ended up eating them for our breakfasts the next couple days! Thank you so much Shai, Trina and fur babies! Wish we could have stayed longer!

The kitchen, living area and lanai were spacious and always open, and all looked out over the ocean. Breakfasts were excellent, with fresh fruits and avocado and eggs from the owners' farm, along with wonderful Kona coffee that they grew and roasted themselves. Breakfasts on the lanai overlooking the Pacific were in some ways the best part of the stay. Shai and Trina (the owners) and the other guests were all interesting people, and it was a real pleasure to sit around the massive wood table and just talk and sip our coffee as we looked out over the ocean, with small birds chattering and flying around, and chickens clucking out in the yard. The owners also have four cats and two dogs, though they mostly kept to themselves. The steep driveway is a little intense, but it adds to the charm. I highly recommend Lilikoi.

From the location, to the food, to the comfort of the rooms, to the view, to the friendliness of the hosts, this was the perfect place to stay in the Big Island.  First, the location; the Lilikoi Inn is located high on a hillside overlooking the Kona coast. That means the view is spectacular; breakfast on the lanai overlooking the ocean every morning is guaranteed to melt away any stress you brought from home. Then, in the evening, you can sit on the lanai and watch the sunset over the Pacific; I wasn't kidding when I titled this review, ""Paradise""! Another benefit of the elevation: it is never too hot, and the night temperatures are perfect for sleeping with open windows.  Then, there's the food; Shai is a master chef, and every breakfast is created with love and artistry, using fresh eggs from the free range chickens on the property, fresh fruit and vegetables from the garden, and Kona coffee grown on their own property, hand picked and perfectly roasted. While eating your breakfast, you can view the garden, with its fruit trees and coffee plantings. Freshly picked fruit is always available for the guests, and there is a full kitchen available for guest use as well.  The rooms are large, attractive, clean, and comfortable, and each room has a private entrance.  Best of all, to me, were our hosts, Shai and Trina, who welcomed us with homemade smoothies and avocado toast. Both Shai and Trina know a lot about the island, and they provided us with wonderful information about things to see and do.

It's a bit further up the mountains, so very lush flora around, and artists' village in Holualoa is very close. One needs to drive a bit to get to the coast, Kona, etc. There are famous Kona coffee farms around, one can explore Heritage Site with its Refugee City, see the turtles colonies, etc, etc.  We didn't go to see Volcano this time as we stayed only 2 and a half days, 3 nights and our previous stay, several years ago,was dedicated to exploring the volcano.  The atmosphere in Lilikoi Inn is very homey and comfortable, Shai and Trina go above and beyond to make your stay pleasant. Starting with amazing welcoming cocktails, wonderful breakfasts -Shai is a professional shef, so you can imagine, I have dietary restrictions-and nobody forgot about them once, even though they're a bit tricky. Everything was tailored to my needs like in best restaurants..one feels like royalty. Or like at home-choose what you please:)  Shai and Trina are always there for you to give directions and explain where and how to get to places. Very friendly and engaging and helpful. The room gets cleaned and spruced up a bit each day-I never saw it in any bed and breakfast before. There are plenty of books to borrow and read, and Wi Fi is good and TV has many options-not that we checked them all, or had time to do so, but if tropical rain catches you at home-there's plenty to do.

The hotel is located on the mountain side, so it is cooler than the coast side. It may be better to have some clothes that can be adjusted one by one, especially for Japanese. Even if it rains on the mountain side, it will be fine when going to the beach.  Because there are mosquitoes, bringing insect repellent (electronic mosquito removing) may make you more comfortable.  As it is surrounded by greens like a jungle, you may feel moist.  The sunset from the terrace was the best I have ever seen.  The owner's breakfast, fruit and coffee were delicious as it lives up to all the rave reviews it got.  The time we spent drinking wine on the terrace after going out for dinner in the evening was the best.  The personality of the owner and his wife was friendly and you can enjoy conversation according to your English ability.  There was a sensitive service that is not found in a hotel. When we did not need breakfast, they cared for us to prepare lunch for instance.  The tourist spot guidance including snorkelling spots, and well-equipped beaches was appropriate and we enjoyed it very much  It was very good as a base for enjoying around Kona.  However, rental car is required.  Although we Japanese were puzzled over the right-hand traffic, it was not difficult to drive because of the low traffic volume there.

The 3+ acre grounds of the property are gorgeous, a tropical rainforest setting with all kinds of trees, flowers, fruits, and the delicious kona coffee that the owners harvest and roast themselves. There are animals as well including kitties, dogs, and chickens (fresh eggs) which add a fun element.  As should be clear from the body of reviews, Shai and Trina are delightful hosts. So many thoughtful touches made our stay personal and very special. The hosts listen carefully to guests' food preferences, provide extra homemade snacks and smoothies, have wonderful suggestions for things to do, and are simply very funny, kind, and enjoyable to be around. A favorite time was breakfast where the locally grown and homemade food was to die for, but also the hosts did a nice job of setting up an environment where guests from around the world really enjoyed themselves and the conversations.  Having the guest kitchen available is so handy and a real money saver; the prices at Lilikoi were very affordable and a great value compared to other properties I researched and that we stayed at during our trip.  The location is also desirable, just a short drive to the beach and Kona town, but located in the hills near quaint artist colonies, amazing restaurants, quirky shops, etc. This also makes the temps a bit cooler, more comfortable than down below.  We hated to leave Lilikoi for our next stop, and hope to return some day. Now that we are home in West Virginia, I find myself occasionally closing my eyes and remembering what it felt like to relax on the upper lanai with the fresh breezes and sunshine, a homemade smoothie in hand, gazing at the most lovely view of the lights of Kona town, a vivid sunset, and the vast Pacific. Utterly relaxing! It is a place that sticks with you.  We can't imagine a better, more authentic and delightful accommodation in the Kona area. Highly, highly recommended!

565850009,50,"Wonderful stay, authentic Big Island","Less than 30 minutes from the Kona Airport, the Lilikoi Inn is a lovely bed and breakfast inn overlooking Kona and the the bay. Located in the small town of Holualoa, it is more authentically Hawaiian, less commercial than a Kona big hotel or vacation rental. Sunsets and views of Kona bay are fantastic when enjoyed from the comfortable upper Lanai. Guests are allowed use of the guest kitchen, which is fully equipped, so dinners 'at home' are pleasant and relaxed. Shai is a great cook, breakfasts are tasty, and he is careful to ask about food preferences and allergies. His afternoon smoothies were a highlight of our stay. Shai is also a terrific resource for information about the various activities and tourist attractions in and around Kona, as well as the various local restaurants.

564033785,50,Lofty Lookout at the Lilikoi,"The Lilikoi Inn is located above the quaint town of Holuala and overlooking the Kona Airport. The entrance road is steep, but our two-wheel drive rental car made it up the grade without a problem and oh was it worth it! We were surround by grapefruit, avocado, banana, papaya, and coffee trees to name just a few of the plants which surrounded us. The owners, Trina and Shai, have made their home and farm into a relaxing getaway from the beach scene and a great base for explorations of the Kona coast. It is only a short drive to downtown Kona and to Costco (the best prices on wine and gasoline).    Shai, the chef, provides hearty breakfast which always includes fresh fruit and avocadoes from his farm. A cup of Shai’s well brewed coffee in the morning made for a great start to each day’s island explorations. Because the breakfasts were so filling, we often had light lunches supplemented with fresh bananas and papaya from the Lilikoi farm. We also treated ourselves to Gypsea Gelato, down the road towards Captain Cook. Some days Shai made a pot of delicious soup which he left for us in the fridge since he knew we didn’t usually want to go out for dinner. Most evenings we much preferred sitting on the lanai taking in the lovely sunsets over the bay and the twinkling town lights.    Our room spacious and included a lovely painting of the passion fruit over our desk. It included a private bathroom, TV, Wi-Fi, and a easy access to the lanai. We also had access to a fully equipped kitchen and the living room, which included a piano. We made good use of the kitchen in the evenings and thoroughly enjoyed an impromptu concert one evening when one of the Australian guests played the piano, accompanied by another guest on a ukulele. The Lilikoi really did attract some of the nicest people we met on the big Island. Beach towels, chairs, umbrellas, and snorkeling gear were also available.    Shai and Trina went out of their way to make us feel welcome taking time to show us around the farm, demonstrate how to operate the secluded hot tub, and help us plan out how to go about each day’s adventures. The grounds show evidence of Shai’s artful stone and tilework. While we were there he was working on a colorful tile topped table.    In short, the Lilikoi is beautiful place to relax away from the more touristy hotels.",Mar 2018,February 2018,Traveled as a couple,The Tropical Suite and the Lilikoi rooms are both upstairs with direct access to the living room...,"Fairfax County, Virginia"

556214756,50,Great visit to the Lilikoi Inn,"My wife and I had an absolutely delightful stay at the Lilikoi Inn during our January visit to the Big Island in Hawaii. The B&B is located close the pictureque small town of Holualoa, a 15-minute or so drive from Kona-Kailua. It's near the top of a steep approach road that would be best served by a four-wheel drive vehicle, although our powerless rental Hyundai Velostar managed it OK.    The Lilikoi Inn is named for the omnipresent passionfruit all over the multi-acre property. It has its own vegetable garden, coffee and fruit trees, with a magnificent view from the lanais (balconies) to the town and the Pacific.    Shai and Trina are great hosts; Shai is a former chef in California and prepared filling, delicious treats for breaKfast.

555631990,50,An Absolute Jewel,"My wife and I absolutely refuse to stay in large sterile hotels when traveling on non-business trips. Those who do miss the emotional and intellectual pleasures of Bed and Breakfasts. Meeting people who open up their businesses and homes to provide you with comfortable lodging and sometimes excellent morning culinary offerings is never to be missed. We have experienced many B&Bs throughout the world, some good, some middling, and some without compare. The Lilikoi Inn in Hulualoa, Hawaii is certainly without compare -and- with comparison to the dozens, possibly tens of dozens of B&Bs, we have experienced, it is certainly in the top two or three. Situated on 3 acres of gorgeous land, 550 meters above Kailua- Kona, this B&B has one of the most breathtaking views of the ocean that I have ever experienced. The property has a seemingly endless variety of Hawaiian plants and trees. Kona coffee, Macadamia trees, Lilikoi (of course), bananas and dozens of others I cannot name. The owners of this jewel are Shia and Trina, two transplanted San Franciscans, who owned a very successful catering and cafe business stateside before beginning a new adventure in Hawaii. Both are bright, outgoing, funny and just a bit left of center. Both speak multiple languages, have traveled extensively and just really down-to-earth. Shia is a master chef and creative botanist. Trina has so many different talents, it is a bit difficult to describe. My wife is constantly fiddling with different types of plant breeding so it was not surprising that she and Shia hit it off. As for me, I could easily become friends with both of them. Now finally to the B&B: The building, with the outrageous views is attractive, clean and offers every amenity. There are five beautiful rooms and the top offering has it’s own private Lanai, as well. Given Shia and Trina’s previous catering and cafe experience, breakfast is not to be missed, served in a beautiful Lanai, overlooking the coast. Each morning’s breakfast is something wonderful and different that Shia has created -and- since they grow and roast their own 100% Kona coffee, that is just icing on the cake.

During our 3 days at the Lilikoi Inn we felt like home from the first second on.  Not only were we welcomed warmly with a snack, fresh Kona coffee, a Hawaiian hug and warm words, but also were stunned by the view over Kona and the west coast of the big island from the breakfast porch.  Our rooms were perfectly equipped, the bathroom is brandnew and everything perfectly clean and cozy.  Every morning during and after the breakfast gathering with the other guests as well as Trina and Shai we were given first hand local advice about which beaches to go to, which hikes and trails to take and which places to see.  The breakfast is another detail to be highlighted, since Shai as a passionate and long-time cook prepares absolutely delicious meals in several courses for all the guests staying at the Lilikoi.  Beach equipment such as snorker or boogie boarding gear as well as beach chairs are always available in large number and you can just pick your stuff and throw it in the car before leaving.  If you love animals you're treated with 3 cats and 2 dogs as well as a bunch of funny chickens in the garden behind the house. If you love good food the kitchen is always open for trying Shai's meals or cooking your own. If you enjoy plants and vegetation, Shai will show you his own banana trees, passion fruits and coffee.

The ocean view over Kona from the rooms is amazing. But that also means the rooms don't feel completely private. We got to stay in the Lilikoi Room and Tropical Suite. They were very accommodating in getting us in even though we had to move rooms due to limited availability (they made this super easy). The Tropical suite felt a bit more private, being at the end of the house. Both rooms were reasonably clean. The breakfasts were very tasty and plentiful. During our 4 mornings there, Shai rotated between a couple different dishes, both amazing. And he was glad to share techniques and recipes. Come here for the hospitality and family feel. It's not for loners, as the breakfast is family-style affair. The hosts ensured we had everything we needed and had all the info to make the most of each day. We borrowed a boogie board and some old snorkel gear, which was a very nice resource. If you know the island well you may not need that, but for anyone unfamiliar this is a great first stop. You may need a little patience if trying to reach the hosts by phone, since they're probably busy talking with and helping the guests there. And the coolest thing about the property is that it's a working farm with coffee, bananas, and many other tropical fruits/nuts you're free to eat (yes, you have to pay for the bagged coffee beans).",Dec 2017,November 2017,Traveled as a couple,,LargeBrook

Shai and Trina, enjoy flowers as much as I do and you will find such a variety of plants. Free range chickens, wild turkeys, and Izzy, their pet dog are just a taste of animal life you will always find.    Shari reminded me of the typical Hawaiian when I first met him….flowered shirt, bare feet, and quite a sense of humor. Talented is another word I would use to describe Shai. Throughout the grounds you will see his talent of mosaics, from a beautifully designed outdoor shower, entries and staircases, to a outdoor pizza bake oven. His talent does not go unnoticed in the kitchen. He uses many of the fresh fruits and plants from his gardens and acreage to create some delectable meals. Make sure you get some of his guacamole dip made fresh straight from his avocado trees. Shai is an acclaimed chef having catered and served some of the elite of California.

541211931,30,"The Good, Not So Good and Just Plain Ugly","Spent some time deciding whether or not to write a review of this place, but decided it was worth the time to pass on our experience FWIW. We were going to stay two nights but due to personal reasons only stayed one. Which was enough.    We arrived around 3pm and were met by Shai, who insisted that we must have a smoothie Right Now when all we wanted was to get our things and have a bit of time in our room, out of the heat. But he wasn't listening or picking up our non-verbal cues.    Got to the room, the downstairs one, which seemed odd compared to what we'd recalled we'd booked but we were tired from the heat down at sea level and were at the end of our two week trip. No internet connection as represented in the site information, and we both needed to get online. Met Trina while sorting it out and I mentioned as something I thought she would want to know...that there was no connection downstairs. She got defensive and basically said that our expectation was unreasonable since and I quote ""we were on an island in the middle of the Pacific"" and so shouldn't expect reliable internet access. Seriously? When all they needed to do was simply put a router in the downstairs room?    Turned out that Shai had put us in the wrong room. Really. Not kidding. Had to gather up all our stuff, which was loose and disorganized from a week of car travel and take it upstairs. Shai did help which we appreciated.    The room we'd actually booked seemed fine and we settled in to rest before going back down the hill for dinner.    There was an interior door that opened onto the kitchen, which we hadn't fully shut after dealing with the internet stuff. Trina looked into our room, saw our paper grocery bag of road food, walked right in and picked it up, telling us that we couldn't have food in the room because of ants and that it would go in the kitchen frig. Fair enough but her tone of voice was extremely unpleasant and it was rude to enter without asking.    Took showers the next morning and started to notice how dirty things were in some corners and edge areas. This was not mold, as mentioned in another review. It was dirt and dust from lack of decent housekeeping. Ditto the rusty shower bar.    Breakfast was fine, nothing special. We left right after.    I agree with the reviewers about the trip up the hill, but that just is what it is. The second time back up was no problem. What needs to be fixed is the large shallow rocky hole one must maneurver over to get into the *unmarked* parking area.    So I'm sure there will be a response along the lines of the previous ones and that's fine. But nothing they say changes the facts of our experience or what is in the photos.

527835801,50,Staying with Shai and Trina is like staying with family,"My wife and I recently had the pleasure of staying at Lilikoi Inn. The room was comfortable. Shai and Trina provided us with beach towels, beach umbrellas, snorkeling equipment, and body boards. They gave great advice on how to modify our vacation plans to see more of the things that we wanted to see. But there are two reasons, in particular, that staying at Lilikoi Inn merits five stars.    First, the food. Shai is an excellent chef. His breakfasts are far superior to any food that you will otherwise have for an affordable price on Hawaii Island. Each breakfast begins with a fruit course. During our stay, the fruit course consisted of halved papayas filled with a yogurt/tapioca/fruit parfait. The papayas were the best that I had during our trip to Hawaii: perfectly ripe and flowery. The fruit course is followed by a savory course. During our stay, we had breakfast burritos, frittatas, and an assortment of other delicious dishes. Often, breakfast was so substantial that I could easily save a portion of it for lunch or dinner.    Second, and more importantly, Shai and Trina treat their guests like they are family. On the day that we arrived, we got to the inn just before sunset. Instead of having to find a restaurant that evening, Shai treated us to breadfruit curry. On another evening, Shai treated us to homemade chicken noodle soup. Both dishes were excellent. They were mildly spicy and deeply flavorful, and they made use of the local fruits and other food resources available to Shai on the island. At breakfast, Trina provided great conversation. By the time we left the inn, we knew the her story of traveling Europe as a youth, meeting Shai in Israel, and ultimately moving to Hawaii. She could easily inform me of the names of about ninety percent of the flora growing on her property. And she had great recommendations on where to eat dinner. If you are persistent, Shai will take you on a tour of the property and point out to you the different types of fruit bearing trees and shrubs. While making our travel plans, Trina was very kind and accommodating as I had to change my travel plans not once, but twice. By the time I left Lilikoi Inn, I had already decided that one day I would return. That is the mark of a great host.    It is important to note that Lilikoi Inn is on the slopes of Hualalai near the village of Holualoa. It is about 30 minutes from the nearest beach, there are not a lot of restaurants nearby, and it is more likely to rain there than even just five miles away, along the coast. But if you love the flora of Hawaii just as much as the beach, if you want to drink coffee and eat fruit harvested at the very property where you are staying, if you want conversation that helps you have a human connection with your host, and if you want great recommendations on what to see and where to eat, Lilikoi Inn is the place to stay. I couldn't recommend it more.",Sep 2017,September 2017,Traveled with family,,"Salem, Oregon"

We arrived at night in the rain and Shai guided me from the Kona airport to the Lilikoi Inn which is up in the hills overlooking the Kailua-Kona area. We were exhausted from our long flight and Shai helped us with our luggage to our room and we immediately fell asleep. In the morning after waking up we went out to the lanai for breakfast. We couldn't believe the view, We were up high in the hills overlooking the hillside and ocean. Two other families were at the table, Shai and Trina made sure we all were introduced and felt at ease, breakfast consisted of fresh banana in a fresh papaya, juice, fresh egg on toast and home grown and roasted coffee. I didn't want to leave the lanai, I just wanted to keep looking out over the lush green vegatation down the hillside to the ocean. We spent our first two nights at the Lilikoi Inn, and after touring the island for the next week, we came back to the Lilikoi for our final night and morning before leaving for home.We celebrated our final morning and 30th wedding anniversary at the Lilikoi.

The house is great. After a full day of running around on the steaming hot coast it was fabulous to come back to the amazing lanai to watch the sunsets over the ocean in cool comfort. It is a really lovely thing to not need air conditioning to sleep comfortably on Hawa'ii. We could fall asleep to the cocqui frogs and awake to bird song with just the right temperatures. You won't be cold - but you will be comfortable.    And your hosts Shai and Trina are just fantastic. Striking the right balance between personal attention and personal space. They were always on hand with great recommendations and conversation. But were never under foot when we wanted alone time. Every recommendation Shai made for activities and restaurants were great. Every single one! We had some incredible meals thanks to Shai's recommendations. And we saw some great sights we would not have known about otherwise.    But it is worth coming here just for the food and the coffee! Shai is a professional chef. And an inventive one at that. Breakfast each morning was a veritable feast and far surpassed anything we were served at the 5 star resort we stayed in on Maui. The coffee he grows on the farm is soooo good.

472098726,50,Quirky hilltop retreat,"While it’s not far off the beaten path, the Lilikoi Inn seems worlds away, perched on a hillside and flanked by dense growths of coffee, banana and avocado trees—the products of which we got to sample yards away from where they were grown.  As operators, owners Shai and Trina give it 110 percent. Shai’s big, imaginative and healthful breakfasts served to guests at a huge table on the main lanai start the day, featuring coffee grown right within view.  Then, after you linger to digest the breakfast (and chat with the personable hosts), Trina can point you to a half-dozen touring options to match your interests and energy level for the day.  The great room off the main lanai also features a fully equipped communal kitchen—where we prepared dinner when we felt like staying in one night. (The avocados were dropping, so we incorporated as many as we wanted.) Avocados and a whole, freshly cut stalk of bananas (Shai called me over to watch the proper way to harvest them) also were posted at one corner of the lanai for guests to grab a quick snack. These and other fruits from the property also went into the smoothies that Shai (a professional chef) offered on arrival—as well as when we happened to be lounging outside.  The narrow, paved road that winds steeply up the hillside to the property seems forbidding at first, but less so after you realize there are only three houses or so along its length, and that there’s about a 0.01 percent chance of meeting a driver descending at the same time. (The leeriness subsides quickly after driving up and down a few times.)  Sunsets are gorgeous from the main lanai, which offers a great ocean view down over the trees. The property, if I am not mistaken, sits at about 2,500 feet, so the view is panoramic.  We’d definitely stay there again. Shai and Trina are extra-accommodating hosts. We had a late-late flight off the island (11:30pm), so they told us to leave our bags, tour and fetch them later. When we returned to wait to leave for the airport, we hung out on the lanai and caught part of a final sunset, when Shai surprised us with two more final smoothies and chatted a bit—even though our stay had officially ended about eight hours earlier.",Apr 2017,February 2017,,,

431554237,50,Hospitality by the bucket,"We stayed with Trina and Shai (shy) during our all too short visit to Big Island (3 nights). We chose them based on previous reviews and location to the airport at Kona as we had a very early departure on our last day. Lilikoi is located around 20mins drive from Kona airport and relatively easy to find, although we did go wrong first time due to satnav and the dark streets.  The property itself is very well appointed, our room was large and very comfortable. Shai greeted us with a huge hug upon arrival (and the dogs) and took us to meet the other guests on the veranda. Breakfast is a truly family affair, you eat beautiful delights knocked-up by Shai, with the other guests around a large table.  I can genuinely say we would not have managed to see all the sites without the excellent itinerary ideas from Shai. We spent a busy couple of days from morning to late evening taking everything in, returning for a good nights sleep, a shower (with our one towel, only negative point) and of course the wonderful breakfast.  3 nights was all too short, the island is massive by comparison to the others. I would say a 4x4 is a must if you really want to see all the sites (mandatory for some), leave the cabriolet for Oahu.  In summary, we had a wonderful stay and felt part of the family for the very short time, would love to know how well Ironman Ben did and how that hand crafted mosaic is coming along.

430454651,50,"A perfectly relaxing, perfectly pretty stay near Kona","What a beyond-wonderful place!    First, Shai was an incredibly generous, helpful, and funny host. His breakfasts were so good, and many components, including the coffee, eggs, vegetables, and fruits, came from the inn's surrounding garden and farm. Fresh juices, smoothies, and little snacks would appear throughout the day, the kitchen was open for guest use, and mac nuts and just-picked produce were always on the table.    The upper-level lanai, where breakfast is served, has these panoramic views of the Kona Coast and some of the best sunsets we saw in Hawaii, full stop. Below that is another lanai and then the gardens, hot tub, and a beautiful tiled outdoor shower tucked away in the trees. I'd recommend setting aside some down time to just relax, read, and explore the property. There are all sorts of places to get lost, little nooks and crannies, clever bits of art and decor, and shady trees to read under.    It was so, so serene up in the hills. We woke up each morning to roosters and birds, or one of Shai's cats, who liked to rub his head on our screen door. :D There are also two friendly dogs, both of whom kindly tolerated my near-constant attention and belly rubs.    I thought the location was ideal: just a few minutes' drive into Kailua for bars, restaurants, dive shops, etc. It's also about 30 minutes from Waikaloa and just about 2 hours from Volcano. Get an SUV for the steep, winding driveway (and the rest of the roads in Kona, for that matter). It's not the easiest ascent, but the views are worth it.    But really, back to the hospitality. I've never had more fun talking to and planning with a host before. Shai's recommendations and advice -- travel, life, and otherwise -- were tops. He knew the best local restaurants, secret beaches, hidden hikes, what to eat when, when to go where. More than once, he found us as we were leaving for an excursion to knock on the car window and offer a surprise road snack; finding out that we're both into food and photography, he took my husband and me on a tour and tasting of the garden, including the herbs and coffee. I said I wanted to see a manta ray; Shai knew where to find the best manta rays.    Shai and Trina truly made our trip special.

This place is a great place to stay and use as a base to explore the Kona Coast on the Big Island. Rooms are nicely appointed, comfortable and airy. We stayed in the Lilikoi Room (south side room on the top deck). It got really warm in the room in the afternoon from the western sun. The ceiling fan helped but couldn't entirely keep up. There was some foot traffic to deal with, sometimes late at night as other guests arrived. The phone located in the common area was also very audible from within the room. The deck has a world-class view of the Kailua-Kona area and the unending Pacific Ocean beyond. It's a couple of miles to Holualoa where there about a half dozen galleries and at least one top notch restaurant. It's ten minutes to Kailua-Kona where there is plenty to do and places to eat. Trini and Shai are great hosts. They know all the places to go and how to get there. Breakfasts are an event. Two courses: The first course is dominated by fruit - most locally sourced or grown on site (papaya, banana, avocado) along with pineapple and watermelon. The only imports were a few blueberries. It's all served with juice and wonderful Kona coffee. No surprise that the deck looks out over coffee trees - all the coffee you drink here is made from beans grown on site. The second course is even more impressive - we stayed for 5 nights and the second course for breakfast was different every day from a potato-broccoli-cheese quiche to lox and bagels. Trini and Shai are wonderful hosts, full of energy and suggestions on what to do, where to go and how to get there. Breakfasts were so much fun that you had to pull yourself away to go explore the island. There are three cats and two dogs that are friendly and fun to interact with. The view of the sunset and evening lights from the deck is exceptional. There is a shared kitchen available if you want to prepare your own meals. This was an exceptionally wonderful place to stay.

Shai is a chef and they used to own a restaurant in Berkeley, so you know their food is amazing.    But let me go back--I'll start with the location. Near enough Kailua Kona to go to restaurants and the beach easily, but up in the hills with cool air and peaceful quiet, the B and B is located on a working farm. Coffee, avocado, papaya, bananas, and passion fruit grow here. Fresh fruit for breakfast and fresh fruit smoothies in the afternoon if you are lucky. The coffee is so smooth.    The rooms are spacious and the beds are so soft that we want to find the same mattress for our home. We slept about ten hours a night on these soft beds, doors open, listening to the insects and frogs as we fell asleep.    We would awake refreshed and go enjoy breakfast with everyone else at the inn at 8 AM-always fresh fruit, juice, and some good egg dish with plenty of protein to keep you going through the day. It is fun to meet the other guests. We shared a twentieth anniversary celebration with another couple-a great way to start our own marriage.    After breakfast, Shai and Trina will help you plan a day's adventure. Hikes, beaches, turtles, you name it, they will help you find them. We had the best time getting to know Shai and Trina. Dave put it this way-they're like your cool aunt and uncle who have a great lifestyle that you get to hang out with once in a while.

You will need to drive to most places from here - but there is a ton to get to within a 20 minute driving radius.

408898259,50,Lovely Experience,"We heard of them from a family connection and so didn't really know what to expect before we got there. It was better than we really could have imagined.    Firstly, the room: We were there for our honeymoon and if I had to describe to someone what a honeymoon sweet might look like, I would describe the room we got. The room itself was sectioned into two main portions the bedroom are and the bathroom are. The bedroom was very nice and roomy, included an extremely comfortable bed (which we actually since bought for our own home), a loveseat, and a few other convenient amenities. The bathroom was unbelievable. It had a really gorgeous soaking tub, a separate chamber with door for the toilet, and a very large standing shower.    Outside the room was a lanai (which apparently is another word for a covered porch?) which contained a large dining table, some nice patio furniture for lounging, and the occasional gecko (which are local to the area). There are many climates on the big island and the B&B was located in what I think was the tropical one. Every day at about 1pm it would rain lightly for about an hour around the B&B. If we were there at that time, we would bring a laptop out and watch tv or read a book while it was raining all around us. It was absolutely gorgeous and lovely. The views from the porch of the local town, kona, and the beaches were great. You could see how nice it was just by looking down.    If you have any interest in gardening or plants, on the property is a little coffee farm, from which they make their coffee (which you can also purchase). The cofee was fantastic. That brings me to the food. The B&B is run by Shai and Trina. Shai spent many years as a professional chef on the west coast of the United states, and it shows. the breakfasts were two course meals that started with fruit and yogurt and ended with a hot main dish which varied by the day. On top of that, every day there were small slices of bread and fresh avocado, also grown on the property.    Everything about our experience at the Lilikoi Inn was better than we could have expected. We would definitely return.    One thing to note is that they do have pets. That wasn't an issue for us (kind of a plus, actually), but if you have allergies, something to consider.",Aug 2016,July 2016,Traveled with family,All rooms are great,

The entrees were simply delicious - for our two mornings there, we had an egg frittata with spinach and matzoh as well as a bagel with smoked salmon and egg, and of course plenty of fresh fruit - plenty of food that was both delicious and nutritious. Shai and Trina took great pride in their home (for good reason), and showed us the other amenities on the property, including a beautiful path they had carved that led to an outdoor shower and hot tub (which we definitely put to use!).    When it came time to explore the island, Shai and Trina certainly came through again and recommended some great places to snorkel, hike, etc., and even helped us reorganize our trip to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and Hilo in order to make it as efficient and enjoyable as possible. For snorkeling in particular, they have equipment that you can borrow at no cost. They simply ask for a small voluntary donation to fund new equipment from time to time, which we were certainly happy to do.    These people truly define what it is to be hosts, and made our first trip to Hawaii even more enjoyable than we had imagined it could be. A stay at Lilikoi Inn in itself would be reason enough to visit Big Island, and we will actively recommend this to anyone planning to visit Hawaii.",May 2016,April 2016,Traveled as a couple,Green Papaya room had direct access to the lower lanai,"Suwanee, Georgia"
368223633,50,Best bed and breakfast in Kona,"Hidden away off the beaten track high up in Holualoa, this is the best B&B in town. Upon arrival you will be welcomed by Shai and Trina, owners of this 3 acre property, the dogs, the cats, the chickens and kosher the pig. The house is beautiful with a sweeping view of the coastline and Pacific Ocean. All of the rooms are spacious, modern and clean, each with its own private bathroom. Breakfast is served at 8 am, the guests gathering around a magnificent Koa wood dining table, family style. Fresh local fruit, and a delicious egg and spinach omelette were prepared along with orange juice and coffee the morning I was there. Shai is a master at his craft, and did I mention a fabulous artist? Yes, he designs and builds almost everything on the property. Very impressive. I was amazed by the jungle like setting which is home to many local species of flora and fauna along with a vegetable and herb garden, and fruit trees. The jacuzzi and outdoor shower are tucked away in the middle of this property, easy to get to by following the ""made by Shai"" one of kind staircase. Remarkable! Trina and Shai have got this down to a science and their passion for taking excellent care of their guests, and their love for the island is outstanding. I would highly recommend this Bed and breakfast for anyone looking to stay at the BEST BED AND BREAKFAST IN KONA.",Apr 2016,April 2016,Traveled with friends,"If you would like a king size bed, be sure and specify, otherwise it is likely you will have a...",Hawaii
361280188,50,more welcoming than family - a bed and breakfast experience in the truest sense,"We stayed at the Lilikoi Inn for 3 days. We arrived casually but very warmly welcomed and immediately felt like part of the family, not my family mind you but a warm, gregarious, American, all-encompassing family. This was a bed and breakfast true to the origin of the concept. I was reminded of large extended family stays at a cottage or the quintessential family meal where everyone shares their days and tips and histories.    The hosts are Trina and Shai. The bed and breakfast is Shai's project (and obvious passion) and he is brilliant in his role as host and cook. He has past restaurant and catering experience. (Ask to see his photos from his catering days of impressive decorative hummus platters. They are pieces of art!) Both Trina and Shai are sociable and welcoming to guests.    The Lilikoi Inn is a small, working farm (2 dogs, many cats, hens and even a pet pig) located a short drive from the airport and the beachy tourist section of the Island of Hawaii. It is located nearly at the end of a short, steep, dead end residential road which we enjoyed walking up and down to get some exercise before breakfast. Despite being a working farm the bed and breakfast does not at all feel rustic. The house is beautiful and modern. It is spacious, clean and efficiently laid out. Each guest room has it's own entrance on the back of the house coming in from the outside either from the dining lanai or the bottom lanai and the backyard. The views from the dining lanai are gorgeous. You can see out over the trees to town and beyond to the ocean.    Expect to linger over an absolutely delicious, hearty (and enormous) hot breakfast comprised of a starter of a fruit dish followed by an egg dish or pancakes (delicious and I am not usually a pancake fan) and coffee. (I barely had to eat again all day!) The fruits, eggs and coffee beans are all sourced directly from the property. Shai is an incredible cook and very attentive to guests. During breakfast he is in the background, cooking and serving while the talkative Trina regales guests with her thoughts on politics, local restaurants and events, and her planned activities for the day (teaching or swimming or her hobby acting at the local playhouse). Do not expect a quick light meal and then to be on your way to see the sights of the island. Breakfast is at 8am and yet we still found it difficult to get off before noon. Each morning we would get to breakfast and inevitably spend a number of hours listening to Trina chat, sharing stories and tips with other guests, enjoying so much food, and then finishing it all off by sticking around for Shai to finish his responsibilities so that we could benefit from his tips for what we should see and do that day. He provides excellent advise and is obviously genuinely happy to see you enjoy yourself on their island.    The Inn and its amenities are very well thought out and we felt welcome to access everything. There is a fully working kitchen available to guests. Shai uses a separate commercial space so you don't feel in his way at all. He also picks macadamia nuts, papayas, grapefruits, oranges, and other produce from around the property and leaves it on the counter for guests to help themselves to. There is a shocking amount of fruit, coffee beans, and nuts from this small property. There are also snorkels, masks, flippers, wet shoes and such to borrow and take to the beach. All that is asked for in return is a small donation to keep the supply available. Shai was also available throughout the day by phone to guide us when we got lost trying to find some of the island gems he had tried his best to direct us to. His availability and the service and amenities provided are above and beyond what I would expect.    Lastly, don't forget to use the hot tub. It is only a very short walk from the main house and driveway but it was the most private spot on the property I found. Consequently I found it to be the best place to get away on my own and be outside and enjoying nature.

Trina, the other half of the Lilikoi duo, always knew the best places to send us for snorkeling, hikes, food, shopping, or whatever we wished to do that day.

We were all sitting around eating a fantastic breakfast cooked by Shai (fresh eggs and fruit grown on the property) while we discussed all the places we had visited in the world, our opinions on world events. Shai and Trina also gave everyone advice on where to go that day. Some were going hiking, others to see the Volcano and we were off to find the perfect beach. They had advice that you could not find in any tour book.  This was our second visit to the Lilikoi Inn. Shai and Trina greeted us like long lost friends. Shai saw we were tired and so went in and made us a smoothie. We stayed in the Lilikoi room. It is bright, clean and comfortable. The view at night and in the morning was of the whole bay below.

He even serves the coffee and vegetation that grows on their land! Both Trina and Shai are quite knowledgeable about the island and helpful when it comes to planning out sightseeing and adventures. This kind of hospitality is hard to find and is what sets the Lilikoi Inn a part from other accommodations. Truly!

278140439,50,First time in Hawaii,"My wife and I stayed at Lilikoi for 10 days and it was definitely one of the great parts of the trip. We had a lot of fun doing many activities and seeing many places on the island but Lilikoi was the constant that made made the whole trip really memorable (like a really good sauce in a pasta dish).    Every morning Shai made awesome breakfasts with fruit and coffee that came from the property followed by a hot dish (usually some kind of egg dish or pancakes). We would then have a quick briefing where he would give us ideas on where to go and what to see that day. Shai really knows the island well. So much so that I feel like if we had come with nothing planned and just did was Shai suggested everyday we would have had an equally great trip!    The rooms were clean and comfortable. The view off the Lanai is amazing both in the morning and at sunset. We have stayed at many B&Bs and small/boutique hotels and the personal touch bought on by Shai and Trina were a cut above the rest. I would highly recommend staying at Lilikoi while on the big island, especially if you like to get to know people. Shai and Trinia are both great to talk to and since breakfast is served at a communal table you get the change to talk with the other guests that are staying at well. This is really great because you can share stories about what you did the day before and maybe get ideas about what you want to do that way also.",Jun 2015,May 2015,Traveled as a couple,Every room is great since the view from the central lanai is so awesome.,"Frederick, Maryland"
277354657,40,A Quirky Hideaway with Excellent Food,"My husband and I spent two nights at the Lilikoi Inn on the recommendation of a friend. The owners, Shai and Trina, are a hoot. We learned all about them, their stories, their journey to the island, their family, etc. The conversation was fascinating and never stopped, so be prepared to engage with your hosts!    The breakfast is truly fantastic. My rating is based almost entirely on the food, which was the best we had on our trip. Creative (and big!) meals. If you are a picky eater, you may have some trouble. Shai will ask about any foods you can't eat or don't like in advance, but apart from that he'll serve whatever food he feels like cooking that morning. I love being fed that way, but it might not be for everyone. The other huge breakfast perk is the setting - a spectacular lanai with amazing views. There are also birds, fruits, and flowers everywhere you look. And cats.    The room was clean and simply furnished, with a great piece of art. The bathroom is dated, but also clean. The mattress was not very comfortable and the room was quite warm. We turned on the ceiling fan which helped, but the switch was a little finicky and it took a little finagling to get it to work correctly. Several light bulbs were burnt out and the towels and linens felt a little musty. We stayed in the Lilikoi room, which felt a little exposed. The glass exterior doors open onto the lanai and the internal door opens onto the main living room/kitchen, so we could hear the owners and I assume they could hear us. I'm an early riser, so I didn't mind, but I can see that being an issue for some guests. I also wish that Trina and Shai made up the bed. We're tidy people and cleaned up after ourselves, but there's something nice about turn down service on vacation. This felt more like we were staying with family, which was fun at times and a little tiring at others.    The other strength of the Lilikoi is Trina and Shai's excellent recommendations about what to do on the island. We had a personal tour of the Kona Cloud Forest, which was a highlight of our trip and swam with sea turtles on a hidden beach, both at their suggestion. Shai was eager to lend us a backpack and jacket to take with us on our beach hike and our evening trip to Mauna Kea.    Finally, the location. It's pretty secluded and quiet, you'll hear roosters and birds and frogs, which I love. However, it's a bit of a drive to get to Kona or to other sites on the island and the roads are pretty steep and winding. My husband and I don't own a car and we drive very infrequently, so the dirt road to the Inn was a little daunting for us. Parts of the property are picturesque - the hot tub, the outdoor shower, the lanai - and parts are a little overgrown or unfinished. (Shai is working on creating a BBQ area, which means there's some tools and supplies lying around.)    All in all we enjoyed our stay. The food, the views, the fun company, and the island recommendations were great, but we really missed some of those hotel amenities - cold room, firm mattress, plush pillows and towels, maid service, quiet, and privacy - that we so look forward to on vacation.",Jun 2015,April 2015,Traveled as a couple,,"Washington DC, District of Columbia"

Breakfast is the reason we came and it did NOT disappoint! It's at 8am sharp, but all the better to get up and out and well-fed. Shai and Trina, our hosts, are as sweet and gregarious as noted by many reviewers here and they had some excellent tips for where to go to snorkel and see other great sights. We were most impressed with their passionate love for the place. The rooms were very clean - loved the floors and showers, in particular - and the beds were comfortable. Some rooster singing in the early morning was a treat for some of us (LOL!) and the jungle-ly look to the site was charming if not a tad alarming. The only real downside was the parking area...unpaved and not particularly well-lit at night. Not recommended for those with mobility issues.

270276967,50,True Farm to Table Bed and Breakfast!,"After reading numerous positive reviews on trip advisor about Lilikoi Inn, our experience far exceeded our already high expectations. Upon entering the property we knew we were in for a treat. We received a warm welcome from Shai who immediately grabbed our bags and showed us to our newly renovated room. We then received a welcome smoothie that Shai put together using fresh fruit grown on the property and spent time speaking with him and his wife Trina. Both made us feel very welcome as if we were arriving back home after long travels.    Shai grows his own coffee beans, avocados, bananas, papayas, zucchini and many other items on the property. Additionally, Shai also has chickens on the farm and the eggs he serves for breakfast are also provided from his grounds. As you can imagine, eating here is a real farm to table experience.    When you arrive to breakfast you are treated to an artfully prepared table which overlooks the horizon. Coffee, which is grown on the property, is served fresh every morning; fresh tea is also available if you desire. Juice, and papaya filled with yogurt and fresh fruit are served. Also on the table are Shai's homegrown avocados seasoned perfectly and served with crostini bread. This spread alone far exceeds anything we have received at other bed and breakfast establishments (or restaurants for that matter), however this was just the first course.    On day one we were treated to all of the above along with the main course: a bagel, eggs, lox (very generous amount), freshly grown zucchini, tomatoes and cream cheese.. All of the ingredients perfectly completed one another. On day two the main course consisted of a frittata made with locally grown vegetables, rice vermicelli, green onions, spring beans and kefir lime (& probably a few other ingredients I can't recall at the moment) called East meets West. We have never had such a symphony of ingredients, all perfectly balanced which complemented each other to such perfection. It was one of the best breakfast meals we ever have had. It's not every day that someone in the culinary industry (Shai owned several restaurants and catering businesses in the past) personally prepares a meal from their organic farm for you. Given that we are foodies this was a real treat and added bonus to complement the beautiful grounds and warm hospitality that one seeks from a bed & breakfast experience.    But it's not just the incredible culinary experience, beautiful grounds or newly renovated rooms that made this such a memorable experience. What really separates Lilikoi Inn from other B&Bs is the genuine hospitality provided by Shai and Trina. During our stay we had opportunity to speak with Shai on a personal level and really enjoyed learning about his background and love for cooking and agriculture. Shai has a genuine passion for what he does and while staying at Lilikoi Inn, one experiences this first hand. It is very inspiring to see someone who really loves what they do.    Shai, thank you so much for your hospitality, great cooking and your tips and recommendations for us while on the Big Island! It was a pleasure meeting you and Trina. You both made our experience on the Big Island stand out!  Hope to return to your Inn in the not too distant future.  Best wishes,  Mike and Caryn  P. S.

Take in the marvelous view of the coast while your taste buds are being pampered with all these fresh, organic treats.  Rooms are a comfortable size furnished in good taste and have a nice, homey feeling. I stayed on the lower floor which is a bit cooler, while the top floor offers outstanding views.  The hosts are a wonder with the guests – all of them. While I was there two other couples were visiting and one could appreciate the special attention provided for each of us. Great care is taken to ensure guests find their way to the countless attractions: Volcanoes, turtle beaches, snorkeling sites, dolphin encounters, etc. I would recommend however, that if you visit Kilauea, spend a night there to get the complete experience, including night viewing, which apparently shows the red glow even when there is minimum activity. If you appreciate nature and marine life, this is a location worth your time. Therefore my rating covers the “total experience” of a stay at Lilikoi.

He also gave us some great advice on where to go and what to see in the area.    The breakfasts are a big part of what drew us here to begin with, and they definitely did not disappoint. Shai and Trina are restaurateur veterans and definitely know how to spoil you at the table, even with something as simple as sliced fresh avocado or a smoothie.    The location is good. About a 10-minute drive from downtown Kailua, right along a charming strip of art galleries and a coffee plantation in the suburb of Holualoa. Steep driveway makes getting in a slight adventure, but not difficult.    Privacy is less than perfect. We booked the Plumeria Room, which is downstairs and out of the way. Unfortunately, the curtains aren't quite big enough to cover the entire area of the glass sliding doors. No more than a couple of inches of window were left uncovered, but when you're coming out of the shower and there's another guest outside on the lanai, you do feel a tad exposed. Soundproofing is also not great, but that does seem to be common to Hawaiian homes.    The least fun part of our visit was almost certainly a one-time thing, but had enough of an impact on our experience to be noted here. Shai and Trina were hosting a number of their family members, who arrived over the course of our visit. By our last day we were the only non-family in the B&B, which was ... very awkward. We could hear loud movies and animated conversation from upstairs around 9 PM. Around the breakfast table, there was a lot of talk about going on family outings, or how Trina could make phone calls to get locals' discounts for everyone (not us, of course). In the way that happens often with extended family, the talk often turned into proud lectures about various family members' careers and so on. We felt like what we were: unwitting intruders into a family vacation/reunion. Hate to say it about such a lovely B&B, but by the end we were relieved to be on our way.",Mar 2015,March 2015,Traveled as a couple,,"Columbus, Ohio"

261166036,50,The Rest & Relaxation I was looking for!,"Lillikoi Inn was one of the most tranquil, relaxing places I've been to; and I've traveled lots. While staying at the Lillikoi Inn we savored every moment. The amazing sunrises, the sunsets, and the nighttime blanket of glimmering stars in the sky. The sound of absolute quiet with only natural sounds of nature singing or chirping was a peaceful way to fall asleep. Waking up and enjoying a delicious breakfast on the Lanai with fellow guests set the tone for a wonderful day. Between the stunning view and the interesting guests and conversation, sometimes it was difficult to leave for an excursion because the atmosphere was so wonderful ""at home"". Lillikoi was centered enough to go anywhere, but far enough to feel connected to nature and the pulse of the Island's rhythm. If you needed a beach towel, boogie board, scuba fins or snorkeling gear, it was all there. Maps, coupons to events and excursions, travel books, you name it. Being able to pick fruits off the trees and eat them fresh was wonderful and opened my taste buds to love papaya, apple banana's (wow!) and meltable avocado.    Staying at the Lillikoi Inn felt like staying with family. Trina & Shai would join us at breakfast and inquire about our day when we saw them in the evening. Sometimes we lucked out with a bonus of soup or some other tasty treat at the end of the day that Shai was ""playing with"". Just by walking around the grounds we learned so much about coffee and the coffee industry, about various fruits and plants and flowers; not to mention macnuts. Trina even told us where to get the best deal on macnuts... COSTCO - would you believe it? We actually paid attention to the cost of macnuts and went to the Mauna Loa factory ~ and by golly ~ Costco was so much cheaper.    A personal favorite about staying at this charming bed & breakfast was that our daughter could roam, and literally, lose herself on the grounds and we felt safe as she indulged some independence. Unlike a hotel where we would need to entertain her at all times even if we needed a break or would like to take our time; because it was a homey feel our daughter would leave the room before us in the morning, barefoot with her latest flower picks in her hair, and follow the woofers as they collected the chicken eggs or help set the table. She could be gone for an hour in the enchanting and magical grounds and we could enjoy a little longer of a shower or some extra moments of merely laying in bed.    The rooms were clean and cozy and I loved our view of tall trees that gave the sense of isolation. I think the true indicator that Lillikoi was instrumental in our amazing vacation was realized once we returned home. Staying at Lillikoi catapults you into Island life and the easy going pace of a Kamaʻāina (pronounced ka-ma-EYE-na) or local. It took me two full days before I began feeling productive at work upon my return and that has NEVER happened before. So often I get off a plane and go directly into the office and continue where I left off. But not this time. This time I just wanted to go back to the Lanai and eat papaya and drink my tea while my husband drinks his coffee.

The property is so beautiful with gorgeous foliage, fruit trees, bushes, and an incredible view of Kailua Kona from the lanai! There is a hot tub hidden away to enjoy. They provide beach chairs, umbrellas, beach towels, etc. for you to use.  Breakfast is a gourmet treat. Kona coffee grown and roasted right on the property, beautiful local fruit, frittatas, juice, what else you could you ask for?

The Lilikoy is beautifully situated a bit up hill overlooking the ocean and in the middle of the most beautifully and wild garden. The garden is full of Lilikoys, football sized avocados, fresh coffees, nuts and much more. We were treated with the most amazing fruit, coffee and food from Shay who’s an amazing and trained chef.  Starting the morning sitting at the big table on the terrace overlooking the ocean and in the middle of the garden, with fresh fruit and home grown coffee while chatting with Shay and Trina and getting their help on planning the day – it just doesn’t get any better. From the Lillikoy there is easy access to most of the sights on the Island by car.

257566182,50,Home Away From Home,"Most of the accommodations on the Kona side of the Big Island are either expensive, impersonal resorts or along the crowded, noisy main drag of Kona.

Staying at the Lilikoi is a like staying with your new friends, Trina and Shai, who have a great house with an amazing view of the town, water and sunsets. Their house is surrounded by tropical fruit trees and coffee plants that perfume the air. Shai welcomes you with a wonderful tropical smoothie and makes a huge gourmet breakfast each morning, served at a communal table on the huge lanai. We met fellow travelers from all over the world over breakfast. The breakfasts were so much better than we had anywhere else on the island, including the resorts which charged $30 each! Shai even made special ""to-go"" breakfasts for us when we had an early morning activity. After breakfast, he takes time to talk to each guest about their plans for the day, pointing out suggested routes and stopping places on his giant map of the island. You can unwind at the end of the day in a secluded hot tub or outdoor shower.  We LOVED the Lilikoi, but it is not for everyone. You are staying in a house, not a polished resort. The rooms are full of light from the large windows and french doors, but this means that people walking by can easily see in your room unless you carefully pull all the curtains tight. You can occasionally hear people in the rooms beside, above, and below you. If you sleep with the windows open, you will be awakened by roosters at 5:30.

Due to the abundant supply of fruits and vegetables, we prepared avocados, papayas, lilikoi, etc as snacks whenever we liked to. Every morning, Shay impressed us with his chef skills. Each breakfast was surprisingly different, absolutely delicious, of great quality and so fresh (as many ingredients were locally harvested or procured from nearby farmers).

Our room was large, pleasant, and quiet enough to get a very good night's sleep. The bed was very comfortable. Superb breakfasts were served on a beautiful deck overlooking the Kailua-Kona and the ocean. The fruit (papaya, apple bananas, passion fruit), avocados, eggs, and coffee are all harvested by Shai on the property. He picks and roasts the coffee he grows. There is always a large supply of fruit and avocados which Shai and Trina encourage their guests to take for snacks during the day. They also have snorkeling equipment, beach chairs, and umbrellas freely available. Shai and Trina's directions to the property are perfect. Our Garmin was also able to get us there. The best way to use narrow road to the property is stay as far right as you can heading up the road and as far to the left as you can when heading down.

Trina and Shai are very accomodating; it'll feel more like you're staying with family friends than a bed and breakfast. One of the cons is the access road or shared driveway. The road is extremely steep, and if you return to the inn at night, can be very difficult to see where you're going- I was in a rental convertible, and found the drive up the driveway very tough. Once there, the place and its views are lovely. Be aware of the rules, there are no shoes allowed inside, and no locking doors. This didn't bother me, but others might be interested.

We contacted them prior to the visit and they helped us find a car and a great fishing charter experience. We brought a yellowtail tuna home from the charter and our hosts prepared it for our dinner -- lovely.

The second we walked in we were greeted by Shai with his huge smile. We were early and he told us he hadn't organised our room yet so he took our bags and promised our room would be ready in one hour. By the time we got back it was ready to go. We also hadn't had dinner and he offered to make us dinner and before we had time to reply it was on the table in front of us.  2. The breakfast is amazing!!!! Freshly served fruit with coffee, tea and even a hot chocolate for the young ones!!!  3. They know the best of the best. Both Shai and Trina talked to us telling about good places to visit in Hawaii and also interesting stories.  4. It is worth your money.

They are excellent hosts -- sources of wide-ranging and quite useful information, very down-to-earth, genuinely attentive to guests' interests and needs, and just the sort of folks whom you would love to have as long-term neighbors and friends. The guest rooms are very comfortable and well kept, the working kitchen is accessible 24 hours a day, and we made good use of the fabulous elevated deck for breakfasts and enjoyment the other 23 hours of the day -- all in the midst of lush trees and vegetation highlighted by coffee, passion fruit, and avacado trees. And as many other guests have mentioned, Shai's food is (with a tip to SNL Myers'/LInda Richman's Coffee Talk) to die for. His prior life as a chef/caterer in the Bay Area shines through with every ingredient and dish -- so much so that we usually took leftovers (yes, breakfast leftovers) along for lunch on our various daytime excursions. We regret that we departed after only four days, and put Lilikoi Inn at the top of our recommendations for Big Island/overall Hawaiian visits.",Sep 2014,September 2014,Traveled as a couple,"give Trina/Shai a call, to make your reservation and otherwise scope our your visit to the Inn...",

223459314,50,Amazing Bed and Breakfast - Perfect for Foodies!,"I have done lots of travelling and stayed at lots of bed and breakfasts, but the Lilikoi Inn is the ABSOLUTE BEST I have ever experienced. The minute we arrived innkeepers Shai and Trina were at the ready, helping my wife and I unload our bags from the car and welcoming us as if we were close family. It only got better, as Shai (a chef with an amazing palate and lots of heart) showed us our impeccably clean room. We stayed in the Tropical Suite overlooking tropical fruit and coffee trees, with lots of tropical elements such as bamboo floors, a beautiful bouquet of flowers from the grounds, and perfect ocean views. He even offered us hot tea as a welcoming gesture.    After a good nights rest in a super comfy bed, my wife and I were treated to a breakfast like none other I have had in my life! The coffee in my cup was from the coffee trees growing on the inn's 3 acres . . hand-roasted by the innkeeper Shai!! You won't get that at the Sheraton. I could go on and on about the coffee and how good it was, but what followed was equally as amazing. We stayed for 8 nights, and each morning we had a breakfast consisting of fresh fruit from their garden, avocados from their garden, Kona coffee from their garden, and a main course. Each main course was as unforgettable as the next, with maybe the baked fritatta made with papaya and their own eggs being the most memorable. They even made my wife gluten-free meals. After breakfast Shai would come out and help us plan our day on the Island, offering up invaluable tips on how to gain access to the most secluded beaches and hiking trails. It was like our own personal concierge service! We were even able to borrow snorkeling equipment and beach chairs.    In the end, we had an amazing experience at the Lilikoi Inn.

222959476,50,Our best B&B experience ever - Perfect in every way.,"There are few places you can visit in your life that meet your every need, wish, and hope. Lilikoi was this place for us - a truly perfect place to stay. There are innumerable ways in which Lilikoi was amazing, and I will try my best to list a few here for the benefit of future travelers, who, if they are smart, will make an effort to spend more than a few days here. So, here are just a FEW of the ways Lilikoi was such a perfect home for us during our stay (in no particular order):    1. Location - Nestled in the lush tropical mountainside of Kona, you feel like you are really ""away"" from it all - yet, it is only 15 minutes to the beach and the happenin' Alli street in town. It is also easy to get from here to any place on the island, especially now that Saddle Road has been repaved.    2. The rooms/house- Wow wow wow. A gorgeous lookout to the ocean on a large deck (that also serves as our breakfast spot). Fresh fruit grows on the vines and the lilikoi (passioinfruit), avocados, macadamia nuts, and other yummies are there for you to snack upon when you feel like it. The rooms are beautiful - large, great design (with nice details like bamboo floors and tropical elements on the curtains and furniture), HUGE bathroom and shower/jacuzzi, and windows facing the ocean. There is also a hot tub and outdoor shower beautifully nestled in the garden below the house. I would get a smile on my face just walking around the place.    3. The hosts - Trina and Shai were the true Hawaiian ""Auntie/Uncle"" - they treated us like family - making sure we knew where we were going, and telling us about all the great places to visit. If you stay be sure to ask and listen to their advice - they really know what they are talking about. They also provided snorkel gear, beach towels, umbrellas, etc. We really enjoyed spending time with them and getting to know them.    4. The food - We were fed like royalty at the Inn. Shai is a trained chef and would prepare the most amazing and delicious breakfasts for us every morning, often using ingredients from his own back yard, including: coffee, papaya, bananas, avocados, fresh eggs, herbs, etc. I have celiac (cannot eat gluten), and Shai always made sure that my meals were gluten-free (bought special bread and pancake mix for me!). As foodies, this place was like heaven on earth for us.    5. The Feel - we just felt like we were at home. There is no other way to put it. We could have been happy just staying around the house all day, hanging out with the super friendly pets and chatting with Trina and Shai. The beauty of the place was felt both inside and out.

We were impressed by the lushness of the grounds where bananas, passion fruit, coffee, macadamia nuts and other interesting things are available for the picking--nothing quite like fresh lilikoi! Trina and Shai were amazing hosts offering us wonderful, filling breakfasts and fresh fruit smoothies in addition to their expertise concerning things to do and places to explore. During our stay my wife came down with a nasty case of strep throat and she took to bed. Shai and Trina saved the day with herbal remedies, specially blended hot tea, and homemade chicken soup for my wife as we waited for the antibiotics to kick in. Trina and Shai are two of the nicest and most generous people that we've ever encountered on vacation.

It is located in a very quiet neighborhood and surrounded by lush native plants. The lanai has great views of the Kona-Kaimea cost. We felt the room was a little dark (we stayed in the Tropical room). It also faced the breakfast area which limited privacy. Trina and Shai are excellent hosts and speak several languages. They welcomed us with a fruit drink which was really good. Shai has worked as a chef and had a catering business so be prepared for a great breakfast treat. They grow coffee in the property which is available for purchase. Lilikoi means passion fruit - lots of them in the property. Banana and avocado were always available for guests. We were delighted with Trina's stories on her travel adventures. We stayed there only one night which was the extent we wanted to be in the Kona area. They helped us chose a few activities for the day. The property does not have easy access - the rental car barely made up the hill. We had a mid-size car which with all luggage was too low for the steep road, even with Shai's helpful advice. There are no walking distance restaurants.

The B&B is in a convenient location, but feels miles away from anyone else. We enjoyed just walking up and down the road by the house looking at the vegetation and animal life.

We had avocado each morning that was grown from the trees next to the Inn. The avocados were huge, and was the best tasting avocado that I have ever had. Shai helped us plan each day of sightseeing. He even called us while we were out, checking to see if we were doing ok. Shai would always be ready with a smoothie when we returned in the afternoon from sightseeing. After we left the Lilikoi Inn, we stayed in Hilo. When Shai and Trina found out that we would be driving back to Kona for our return flight to the mainland, they even invited us to stop by for a smoothie and to visit. That's hospitality.

The farm is filled with lush vegetation including beautiful tropiacl flowers and fruit trees, and of course an abundance of coffee. One of my favorite things to do while at Lilikoi Inn is to sit on the beautiful lanai and watch the sunset over the ocean, beautiful sunsets every night!    The rooms at the Inn are comfortable and cozy and feel like home.

Being not right in middle of the tourist places is actually a big part of the charm. This place is an easy 15 minute drive to Kailua and good jump off point to go anywhere else in the island. Just as other reviewers pointed out, accomodations and facilities are good but what makes it great is the hospitality of the hosts. From Shai's welcome smoothies, to the delicious breakfasts, to the genuine helping hand to make sure you get the most out of your vacation. It's clear that it's not just a job for them to tend to their customers. They really seem to enjoy it. They were great with our kids and the few days we had here was a big part of why our Big Island vacation was magical. Even though the kids are tired from the previous day and having a hard time getting up from bed, all we have to say is Shai is waiting for breakfast and they jump up pretty quickly! Follow the directions in their website to help you find this place. The driveway is 2.5 miles from 190 HWY on the east side of 180. If you have a low car, drive in to the driveway coming from the south to avoid bottoming out on the steep driveway.

197657068,50,More than a B&B,"Really, Lillikoi Inn is like staying with a family member who has a home in Paradise. Shai & Trina treat you like family, and you quickly come to see them that way too. You are guests in their home, not anonymous hotel visitors.    Travellers need to consider what’s important to them. You need to be OK with being a houseguest, not just a guest. If you want to be in the city, or walk to things, need lots of privacy, or plan to have frequent loud sex, some other B&B might be a better choice. Because yes, Lillikoi Inn is not in-town, but is easy to find after the first couple times (the road to the inn is scary-steep though, unless you come from San Francisco), and noises do carry through the house.    But if you value fun conversations and genuine caring concern for your enjoyment, are laid-back, like meeting people, and enjoy fantastic breakfasts with home-grown ingredients, then stay with Shai & Trina.    Pretend your fun Aunt and chef Uncle have a home on the Big Island. You can borrow any gear (snorkeling, beach umbrellas, chairs, etc.) you may need. Plenty of advice on what to do and where to go is always available. Breakfast is at 8:00, not at 7:00 or at 9:00, because there’s no staff here – it is only Shai & Trina. You therefore also know you can’t make messes for them to clean – you willingly clean up after yourself. You get to play with oh-so-friendly Izzy (aka Decaf) the dog, and the house cats. You are embraced and loved and wonderfully fed.    At Lillikoi Inn, the place you are staying and the people you meet there are as much a part of your trip as the things you see and do - which is awesome. We will surely come back again.",Mar 2014,February 2014,Traveled as a couple,"We stayed in Lillikoi Room - wonderful and big, but probably the least private.

Their inn offers a tropical setting away from the hustle and bustle of the city but also with a view of the harbour where from the lanai you can relax, read, or converse with other guest. Location, location is always important, and the Inn meets my criteria as being centralized for me to pursue other island sites: excursions, snorkelling or being just a tourist. Without exception of all the Bed & Breakfast locations that I have stayed at (Kauai, Maui) Shai provides one fantastic breakfast, smoothies made from the his fruit trees (Mangos, Apple Bananas, Oranges), and his fabulous fresh Kona coffee grown around the acreage of his property.

193975676,30,Inconsistent Experience,"I was hesitant to write a review since our initial impressions weren’t glowing and the owners were so expressive regarding the effect that Trip Advisor reviews have on their business. The food was excellent, really excellent. And, the views are glorious. Futher, Shai, the purveyor, is extremely attentive, but respectful. He was also very hospitable. Our concerns relate to the Inn’s somewhat inflexible cancellation policy, which was tested during December’s extreme winter weather of 2013 on the mainland. Admittedly, Trina, Shais’ wife, was very polite, but also non-committal when we telephoned and emaild to advise that our flights were cancelled, that we had no way to arrive as originally planned and that we’d arrive one day later, thus changing our visit from 3 days to 2. And, we contacted the Lilikoi Inn immediately upon notification from the airline and with proof of the extenuating circumstances, including a copy of our changed itinerary. While pleasant, she just said that we could work things out upon arrival, which was disconcerting when paired with the extreme difficulties of changing travel plans. During our stay we were advised that we could pay what we thought was appropriate, which, in retrospect, I feel was unprofessional. We felt under compulsion to help the owners who are under duress to pay for their son’s college tuition and the high cost of living in Hawaii since they mentioned such on many occasions prior to our departure. We paid ½ the agreed upon cost for the first night in an attempt to placate the owners who were very quick to provide billing details. During our stay, we encountered a rustic, spacious, comfortable room with homey hospitality. But, we did endure an obnoxious guest during our first breakfast. I mention it because the gentlemen described himself in detail as Shai and Trina’s neighbor and friend. To be polite, he was demanding of our attention, including requiring that I put my phone down to speak with him, which mostly included listening to his ramblings about Hebrew classes, the high cost of living in Hawaii, the challenges of finding reputable builders and similar. He was staying at the Inn with his wife while his home was being remodeled and in exchange for work that he was doing on Shai and Trina’s home. While I don’t think that the Inn should be held accountable for their guests, entirely, the extenuating circumstances whereby the aforementioned guest presented himself more as an extension of the Shai and Trina and thus a representative of the Inn definitely colored our impression of the consideration and privacy we were allowed. Otherwise, all guests were extremely pleasant and we enjoyed their easy company. We were very glad when the neighbor/guest wasn’t at breakfast on the second and final day of our stay. A few other impressions that caused us to conclude that the Lilikoi Inn was more average than exemplary include cleanliness concerns and the need for new linens and shower curtains in our room, which was the Lilikoi room. We would not recommend the Lilikoi Inn or return.",Feb 2014,December 2013,Traveled as a couple,,"Augusta, Maine"

Shai was very welcoming. I would highly recommend all of the rooms except ours (the Torch Ginger). This room is very small and while it had a bookcase, chest of drawers and closet, they were all full of someone's belongings. We had to put our things on the floor, making the room even smaller.

Shai and his wife Trina are interesting hosts who speak a variety of languages. Shai was a very valuable source of sight seeing options. The tropical foliage, which also surrounded the hot tub, made for a delightful setting.

191380546,40,So hard to describe this unique place - very good in many ways,"We chose the Lilikoi Inn based on reviews - and are glad we chose it. Overall it's unique - in location, food, and care/attention from the hosts ( Trina and Shai ). We felt like we were part of the family when we had breakfast -- and Trina and Shai joined us to talk about our plans for the day and offer specific and detailed comments about our destinations. Shai even offered to help us with our routes, suggesting we call if we had questions. We took him up on that when we went astray at one point.    The accommodations are very nice - large rooms with good ventilation and other comforts. We spent more time on the lanai than in the room - however, the rooms had screens on the doors/windows while the lanai did not. We enjoyed the meals, but since they are served on the lanai (with superb views) that is unscreened, we ended up with a few extra insect bites.    I've enjoyed stays at B&B's all over the world, and this one is unique. A great combination of personal attention and comfortable lodgings. It's hard to find unless you use the written directions (forget the GPS!!!), and it's high up - above the bustle of Kona Town and close to other interesting away from town.    If you leave breakfast hungry, it's your fault. So much food - too much food? - that's wonderful. You can put leftovers in the fridge and have it later (for lunch?).

189848213,20,Caution: Things are different behind the curtains,"We were here three nights and our experience was VERY MIXED. It started off really good: Terrific accommodation over the city of Kona and we were welcomed very friendly by Shai. First surprise, breakfast is only served at 8am sharp. So whoever wants to have a good sleep misses the breakfast. The breakfast is indeed very delicious, as everyone writes. The 'famous' day recommendations for all guests then follow. Ours was a FLOP. Shai sent us to the less beautiful beaches in the south. We found out later that the beautiful beaches are actually in the north. We should have followed our own planning then we would not have spoiled a full day. For the second evening we were offered by Shai and Trina, that we could cook in the kitchen. So we did the shopping, cooked and enjoyed a lovely evening on the terrace.    The next day we were surprised that the room was, once again, not made and the towels again were not changed. It was already rather damp in the room by now since the towels never got dry correctly at the high atmospheric humidity on Big Island. In addition, Shai then handed over to us a 60 USD tax invoice to our surprise that he wanted us to pay. This was an impertinence because we had already paid everything in the front-end and were not informed that any amount is still due. Something like that hasn't happened to us at any other accommodation on Hawaii.    On the day of our departure the situation escalated when we informed them that we were not gonna pay the tax amount since this wasn't agreed on in the front-end. Both began to yell and Shai got even aggressive. During this discussion they even blamed us, that we did not clean the kitchen in the evening on which we had cooked. Fact was, that the kitchen wasn't really clean before and merely a pan had been in the sink unit for soaking!    When we sat on the terrace in the last evening, we heard Trina in her room talking bad about her guests. Among others: We and another pair had an early flight (before 8 o'clock!) and Shai had offered us to prepare a breakfast package - Trina has really upset about it – because she does not like to get up early and work.    SUMMARY: The behavior of the two hosts was really outrageous and I am annoyed about it up to today (2 months after the vacation). Altogether, we had such a terrific vacation on Hawaii.

The first time we stayed at a five star hotel and it was very nice but could not offer what Shai and Trina do for you when you stay with them. So you can visit the island or experience life in paradise at the lilikoi inn. After you are greeted with a warm welcome after a long day traveling Shai will make you a wonderful fresh smoothie made with fruits grown right there on the property, the property is lush and fragrent with all the plants and fruits that are grown there. There is a fantastic view of Kona with a wonderful tropical breeze from the upper lanai. Which by the way is where you are served your delicious gourmet breakfast every morning with a few other guests and not hundreds of people on holiday.Then before you take off exploring the island Trina and Shai offer advice and directions for whatever you are interested in doing on the island. They can suggest the best beaches, restaurants, and activities so your time and money is well spent. So to sum it up if you are looking for a place to stay that is comfortable, a great value, has awesome food, wonderful views with a lot of privacy, and you want to experience the island like a local not a tourist  we definitely recommend the Lilikoi Inn. More than all that though the best amenity is it's hosts Shai and Trina. What a wonderful couple who give the inn all the warmth and charm it has to offer. They are so accommodating by providing whatever each guest needs to make their experience special. My husband was doing the ironman and Shai made sure he had a healthy meal before the race, and he would always take time away from his daily chores to answer any questions I had about island life, he even let me help harvest bananas which was a cool experience for me. I really looked forward to our conversations with them, they are such a very interesting and special couple.  We had such a wonderful trip, all due to Shai,Trina and the Lilikoi Inn so we recommend it highly but there will be even more pleasant surprises when you get there, we don't want to give it away because that's part of its charm......

Since then, increasing commercialization robs new visitors of that magical experience and saddens returning visitors. This year we discovered the Lilikoi Inn and rediscovered the enchantment of the Big Island, Hawaii.  Warm greetings from Shai and Trina on our arrival, the awe inspiring view from the lanai, the fragrance from the flowers, fruit trees, and coffee plants, and the location, location, location guarantees our return next year. High on the mountain south of the Kona-Kailua airport, the Lilikoi Inn is ideal for the visitor to explore every inch of the island and return to the comfort and beauty of the Inn every evening.  We are divers and there are many opportunities to shore dive or charter boat dive nearby--(check out the night Manta Ray dive) directly down the mountain. For snorkelers, there are several excellent beaches for swimming with turtles, colorful fish, dolphins and amazing coral reefs within an easy drive.  Stay for several days or weeks, the Inn has a centrally located kitchen and clothes washing facilities for the guests. Breakfast by Master Chef Shai, served with his home-grown 100% Kona coffee on the family friendly lanai starts the day the ohana way.

They also assist you in making plans on the island. As first time visitors, we really appreciated this. We were able to visit places that are not on the map as well. Unforgettable places which we will never forget. The Inn was so nice to come back to each evening after visiting the local attractions. We loved the lanai with it's amazing views and having breakfast every morning overlooking Kona and the ocean was absolutely breathtaking. We stayed in the Lilikoi Room and it was beautiful with it's hard wood floors, sleigh bed and the french doors which open to the lanai and it's views. When you picture Hawaii, you picture flowers, greenery, and views of the ocean. The Lilikoi Inn has all of this and more. We felt so relaxed as we sat outside watching the sun set. I already miss the fantastic breakfasts with fresh fruit and eggs while enjoying the beautiful view and awesome Hawaii breeze. The Lilikoi Inn helped to make our trip extra special in every way. It was a dream come true and I really hope to be able to go back some day and if we do, I am sure we will make Lilikoi Inn part of the trip.",Oct 2013,August 2013,Traveled as a couple,"If you love a roomy but cozy room with amazing views, choose the Lilikoi Room.

Trina and Shai are the best hosts with infinite knowledge of everything there is to do/see/eat on the island. The breakfasts are to die for, snorkel gear is available for a small donation, and there are always fuzzy animals to pet and play with.

I definitely recommend taking advantage of the outdoor spa. Shai and Trina were beyond helpful. When we had a tour early one morning they gave us some of their delicious coffee in to go mugs and another day gave us directions to a great beach and let us borrow a beach umbrella.

You will not be hungry for lunch, as Shai's breakfasts are both scrumptious and extremely generous. Best Kona coffee grown right at the B&B.  Had an amazing time visiting a new beach each day. Highlight had to be swimming in the wild with about 40 or so dolphins!!! Saw giant sea turtles up close, snorkeled and came upon colorful fish and coral.

178732105,50,An attraction in itself,"I'm going to agree with Ron! This is a great place to stay if you are a coffee snob, because Shai's coffee--grown right there at the B&B--is not only genuine Kona coffee, but it's better than most of the Kona coffee we've had! I had 2-1/2 mugs of it both mornings we were there, and that's twice as much coffee as I normally have. We even brought a pound of it home with us. Of course the food was great, too. Freshest eggs I've ever had.    The grounds of the B&B are a lesson in local flora and fauna, and if you love passion fruit (like I do), you will find more of it than you could shake a stick at. Also nestled into this tropical setting is a lovely Jacuzzi, which is kept on 24 hours a day and well worth leaving your room for.    Speaking of the rooms. . . Ours was large and immaculate (I forget the name of the room but it was downstairs). We were seriously impressed! Lovely new finishes and fixtures in the bathroom, too.    One word of advice: If you are arriving at Lilikoi Inn after 9:00pm, be sure to call from the airport first! We did not realize that Tina and Shai went to bed at 9:30 and when we arrived at 10pm, we had no idea what to do.

Breakfast included great coffee that grown right on the property, fresh papaya with yogurt + granola topping, and extremely delicious frittatas and omelets cooked up every morning. We didn't always know what we would be doing on a given day, but Shai was full of tips and ideas and directions that helped us figure out where to go and pack a lot of amazing activities into our time on the Big Island. Shai even offered us to-go snacks in the form of deliciously tart apple bananas grown right on the property. This place really has a lot of charm and will stick in your memory long after you leave.

We were definitely spoiled and felt so lucky to have 2 days here in this beautiful house. My 5-year old daughter'd rather relax in the house and hot-tubing than snorkeling or sightseeing.

It is 15 minutes from the main Kona shopping and dining area and at least 20 minutes to a beach for swimming. We loved the wild pigs that roamed this working coffee plantation each night and were thankful that the house dog chased them away to keep us safe. The chickens provided the breakfast eggs each morning but the wild roosters need to be trained to understand that 2am is not sunrise. The interior of the rooms are nicely appointed and comfortable. Shai and Trina ask each guest what they are interested in each morning and give many insightful suggestions on how to enjoy the Island as there is so much to see.

Just when you think you're done, here comes an omelet made from fresh eggs laid by the free range chickens that roam the property. A few pieces of advice: GPS has it's signals crossed. We actually had to drive about 2 miles further up the road to reach the location and the sign for the inn is hard to see. We were also told that some people were intimidated by the driveway which is indeed a doozy. Very steep and, if you come at night, pitch black (which of course provides for great stargazing).

We were so happy we decided to spend our entire trip there rather than going with half on the Kona side and half on the Hilo side. The Lilikoi is very well located with easy day trips to Waipio Valley, Kilauea, and tons of beaches. It was very clean and very laid back, and Shai and Trina were excellent hosts. Shai gave us a yummy breakfast, tips on things to see, and directions every morning. Breakfasts included avocados and coffee grown right on the property. Definitely the best vacation we've ever had.

161846113,50,This is THE place to stay!!!!,"If you like being in the midst of T-Shirt shops, lots of people, cars and the like, stay in the town of Kailua. If you have lots of $$$ and like a very posh, beautiful, sleek surrounding, go to the Four Seasons...way out of town. But if you would like a unique, authentic Hawaiian experience, stay at the Lilikoi Inn. Here, you can experience a beautiful Hawaiian home with outdoor living at it's best. If you like heavenly coffee, you will be right in the middle of the Kona coffee belt and can sample coffee till you can't sleep! If you enjoy sweeping views off the lanai and spectacular sunsets... this is your place. Breakfast anyone? Can you say ""OMG""???? Fresh fruit right from the grounds, delicious egg dishes, all different.    I felt really comfortable here and when I came to my (temporary) home, I could just walk in, sit down and hang out. Shai gives little tips every day...secret places to see turtles, short cuts to get to where you want to go, cool places to see. It's like getting advice from an older brother whom you can completely trust. Trina is so engaging in Hawaiian life and culture and can explain all kinds of things about Hawaii. Our room was cool and comfortable with a spectacular view (we stayed in the Lilikoi room for 5 nights). The place is clean and comfortable. Lots of practical things like towels, kitchen supplies, soaps etc. I would highly recommend this place. They really get it. Enjoy!! We sure did!    Use a GPS to get here...google maps did a good job in general of this area. When you first enter the drive to go up to the house, go slow as it's a steep turn up!

Now the real reason - Shai and Trina. Exceptional people who have created their own special piece of paradise and genuinely enjoy sharing their world with their guests. Nothing is too much trouble, everything is done and offered with a generosity of spirit that makes them and Lilikoi Inn a ""must stay, must return"". We cannot recommend Lilikoi Inn highly enough. P S we stayed in the Green Papaya Room - quiet, spacious bathroom. Go for Plumeria for quiet and view, smaller bathroom. Any room will be just fine, so be flexible. Oh, something else - Great kitchen for guests, so you can eat in after shopping locally and keep your food refrigerated during your stay - ideal if you want a break from eating out or have special dietary needs. And about breakfast, drink the coffee and then buy it a a very reasonable cost from Shai - he grows it and serves it - it is a good brew.

You start your day with a delicious Hawaiian breakfast on the terrace overlooking view of the ocean! Fresh from the garden fruits and coffee with a view, nice morning conversation with a small group of guests learning and sharing Hawaiian experiences.    The hosts spend their time to advice and answer questions, helping to reserve activities and just enjoy communication.You could discuss your daily plans with them and get the important insider info. No hidden fees, wifi is included and good. Rooms are modern and spaceful and stylish with a big bathroom (not typical for B&B), the house terrace allows guests to have privacy or go to common space to enjoy the view of farm and ocean.  The owners really treat you just generously: plentiful breakfasts with fresh fruit, eggs in the kitchen you can use by your own, plenty of fruits grown on the property and you can eat them whenever you want, beach towels, a hot tub and outdoor shower,educational farm tour and more.  Don't miss the sunset! The Sunsets are a must, the sun goes down into the ocean through the clouds (see my pictures)    The property is upgrading constantly and probably next guests will have a delicious pizza from a outside wood-fired pizza oven currently being built by Shai.    The atmosphere is unusual: Tranquility on one hand and positive energy on the other. Tranquility comes from the farm and view and positive energy comes from the hosts. And their ENERGY and enthusiasm is CONTANGIOUS!    You will come back from Lilikoi Inn revitalized and reenergized.

Shai and Trina take a very personal interest in their guests and we enjoyed our breakfast ritual discussing everyone's plans for the day and getting detailed recommendations from our hosts. The restaurants and beaches they suggested were truly outstanding. One of the joys of staying at B&B's is the local knowledge of the hosts and Shai and Trina seem to really enjoy sharing their knowledge and experience.

154687670,40,Charming stay in the coffee belt,"I was a little nervous making my way to the Inn the first night as my flight did not arrive until well after 10pm, but they provide very good directions and I found my way to the property fairly easily. (It's about 20 minutes-ish from the airport down some winding roads.) I felt bad that I had to call once I got there to locate my room, but Shai was very prompt in answering and getting me settled. He makes a delicious breakfast each morning (fair warning that the fruit/yogurt/granola is only the first course!) The second is usually something made with the eggs of the chickens that live on the property. There are always some eggs in the kitchen you can use in your own cooking if you like. Also, there are tons of fruits grown on the property and you can find passion fruit whenever you want it. The coffee, also grown on the property, is delicious.    I loved that I felt like I was staying with relatives. My first morning Shai made sure I knew where I was going and gave me the local spin on things to see. Directions such as ""when you pass mile marker 91 count to 5 and then pull off the road to find the unmarked lava tube to explore"" are so very helpful. Shai also loaded me up with all of the beach gear I could need including beach towel, mat, chair, umbrella, snorkel gear, etc. which was a tremendous help to not have to bring all of this or having to buy it in Hawaii. Trina is very friendly as well and makes you really feel at home.    I had a huge room - they are all different so check out which will suit you in advance. The lanais provide a nice view overlooking the coast for sunset and there is also a hot tub and a really cool outdoor shower which are nice at the end of the day. One of my favorite moments was when I was taking some pictures of the sunset. Shai and Trina were just coming back to the property and Shai saw my car so he knew I was there. He came running in yelling my name saying ""I want to make sure you don't miss the sunset!""

154113254,50,A Little Piece of Paradise on the Big Island,"After reading the glowing reviews here on tripadvisor, my wife and I had our hearts set on the Lilikoi Inn. There was no vacancy when our schedule allowed in Feb of 2012 so we decided to postpone our trip until 2013 just to stay at the Lilikoi inn. What a great decision that was. For us the Lilikoi Inn epitomizes exactly what a bed and breakfast should be. Shai and Trina made us feel completely comfortable and at home in their little tropical paradise. From the clean and comfortable room, to the delicious and plentiful breakfasts heavy on fresh fruit (much of it grown in view from the breakfast lanai; the inn is nested among a lush, green expanse of avocado, coffee, passion fruit, banana and grapefruit trees, - with a wide view down to the Kailua-Kona coastline) to the insider advice on local island activities, this place exceeded our high expectations. Shai takes an obvious pride in growing tropical fruits and coffee, concocting wonderful breakfasts, building projects around the inn, and dispensing helpful advice - and all done with a kind of contagious enthusiasm and a complete lack of pretension. My wife is vegan, so prior to arrival we were a bit worried that she might not get the full b&b experience due to her dietary restrictions. Shai went out of his way to accomodate her and she could not have enjoyed the food more.

153611417,40,The Real Thing,"If you're looking for idyllic Hawaii, this is the place. Situated in Kona upcountry, this B&B grows its own coffee, avocado, lilikoi (passionfruit) and more. Large and tasty breakfasts are made with these ingredients including farm fresh eggs from the resident chickens. The owners, Shai and Trina, go above and beyond to make guests feel welcome. Pleasant conversation, restaurant suggestions and accurate driving directions provide what hoteliers can not. This place has all the personal touches one could ask for. The ocean-facing, wrap-around lanai was the common breakfast area and the vantage point overseeing the 3 acres of farmland. My 13 year-old son loved the animals on the land, especially Decaf and Snowball. He ate more food than I've seen him eat ever - the macadamia nut pancakes especially. (Thank you Shai for making them again on our last day). We met travelers from Austria, Australia, Japan and Germany just to name a few places.

Shai makes the most amazing breakfasts using his own farmfresh ingredients (coffee, avocado, banana's,lilikoi, eggs, etc). After breakfast he makes sure that you have everything you need for an amazing day- he pointed out some great snorkeling sites- and we could borrow some fins and other gear.

He does all the cooking and loves to show everyone around the property and help plan your day. His wife works but she is just as enjoyable when around. Getting there the first time is a little tricky but the website instructions are very good. You are up high overlooking the ocean so it is cooler than in Kailua-Konda.

It's worth visiting even if you do not stay just to pickup a bag of wonderful roasted Kona Coffee that is grown on the Property (I can ashore you it's better then most of the ""Kona"" coffee you can buy on the Island)! Breakfast is excellent and the rooms are comfortable and modern. But the best thing is really the owner's! I was lucky enough to have called in a bit of Desperation a day before I was coming to the Big Island and there was availability. Shai suggested that I call for directions once I got into KOA. Coming in late in the evening Shai guided me to the B&B and made some soup for me that evening (Not part of the normal package), the next morning we had a wonderful Breakfast. After Breakfast I got a chance to tour around the property; Shai and Trina were kind enough to give me some directions of things worth seeing.

The pros and cons for us were as follows:  Pros:  - good location  - great breakfast (the avocado with Hawaii spice, garlic, etc. was fabulous, as were the blueberry pancakes)  - comfortable bed  - some great advice on where to dine  Cons  - the driveway is a bit steep and harrowing, especially if you have a bigger vehicle, though Shai can explain a way to make the approach to the steep entrance a bit easier.  - the rooms feel less private with the French doors with curtains on the room we had. Also, sound seemed to carry pretty easily.  - there are no room keys, so you cannot lock your room. We were fine with this, but some may not be.  - in our room, the shower had two curtains and there was a bit of black mold on the curtains.

149817238,50,First visit to Big Island--what a wonderful find!,"As part of a husband-wife, 2-week trip to Oahu and the Big Island, I sought out a B&B on the Kona side of the Big Island as a launching site for our treks up and down the leeward coast. Little did I know that Lilikoi Inn was a treasure when I booked! I thought it sounded good, but didn't realize just HOW WONDERFUL our experience would be. Shai--born in Israel--is a gregarious, affable host, with, without doubt, the best breakfasts we had during our travels. Heavy on fruit and eggs and other healthy goodies! We were greeted with a smoothie of wonderful proportion and taste and treated to a tour of the grounds, complete with a ""rainforest"" outdoor shower, a hot-tub and a veritable jungle of plants, flowers and coffee plants. An outdoor, wood-burning pizza oven is in the works. The fruit for breakfast and smoothies comes right from Shai's garden. The coffee is grown on site, too, and is most mellow and plentiful.    Our room was exceptionally comfortable and attractive; the bath well-appointed and supplied. If you expect hotel turn-down service, look elsewhere. Make your own bed or not, as you like. It's YOUR room; treat is as such. No worries on that score from this corner!    Following breakfast each day Shai provided suggestions (and directions) regarding the day's activities we might consider. We saw things we otherwise might have missed! And his directions were nonpareil!! If you're the tour-bus type, skip this place. If you're adventurous and love a warm welcoming atmosphere, gourmet breakfasts, and a background of traditional Hawaiian music, the Lilikoi (passionfruit) Inn is for you. It was a little bit of heaven on earth for us. Shai calls both his home and surrounding area his ""Promised Land"" and he works hard to make it yours as well!    Last, we discovered that Trina (Shai's wife) is an alum of the same small university as I am (Brandeis U).

Leaving the place was the only thing that we didn't like at all, still driving tears to my eyes. For hikers: Ask Shai for the map to the ""Lost fountain of Youth"", which will lead you to a wonderful water fall, that hardly anybody else will find.

We've been to all the islands at least once and this was our third time visiting the Big Island. However, our friends were flying out late Saturday evening after we checked out of our shared Kona condo, but we had delayed our return flight until Sunday evening due to high costs and limited availability (holidays). So I sought out a unique place to stay for that extra night on our own. The Lilikoi Inn was a great option.    I sent a courtesy email to our hosts to say we would have the other couple with us for part of the evening, because we wanted to find their place before it got dark, and our friends' flight wouldn't leave until late that night. Much to our (and our friends') surprise, Shai (owner and chef) greeted all four of us and gave us the grand tour, complete with fresh lilikoi (passion fruit) tasting on the grounds, and wonderful smoothie from his kitchen. He didn't care that our friends weren't paying guests. He knows they could be, someday! They loved it and wished they could have stayed.    The hot tub jets weren't working that day, and I definitely would have wanted to enjoy that on a longer stay, but since we were only there overnight it was no big deal. Shai has done a lot of work on the property (currently building a wood-fired pizza oven!) and he takes pride in showing you around. The large breakfast lanai seems to float in space, held down by the enormous teak table.    Both Shai and Trina gave us great tips on how to go about finding a home or land to buy and what it's like to assimilate to island life (we mentioned we have had a back-burner plan to do so for years). They were very entertaining to talk with. And breakfast was wonderful. The only negative wasn't within their control - The one-lane road leading to their place is at a very steep angle to the very narrow and winding ""highway"" that gets you there, so our midsize (i.e., small!) rental car, loaded with ourselves, our two friends, and 4 suitcases in the trunk, scraped badly as we made the transition. The rear bumper fiberglass was scraped pretty bad underneath, the tailpipe was bent and the right rear quarter panel was partially popped out (my husband fixed that without trouble). Later after we dropped off the other couple at the airport, we still scraped both the front and back bumpers a little, coming and going. If you are driving a 4WD, you won't have a problem. Once on their narrow driveway, a regular car can make it just fine, although we were thankful we didn't meet anyone. It's steep country with lush foliage, which adds to the charm of the place, if you're open to it.",Jan 2013,January 2013,Traveled as a couple,"We were in the Green Papaya room, which is downstairs, and has a louvered door to a shared space...","Helena, Montana, United States"

The Inn is nestled in the hillside surrounded by jungle but with stunning views of the beaches and ocean. I love that their property is covered with all kinds of tropical plants from vines to guava trees, avocados and bananas, coffee and of course lilikoi. I had never tasted freshly picked guava or passion fruit and the flavors were really incredible.    The land also serves as a coffee farm and Shai also raises chickens and serves much of the fruit grown on the property to guests. The whole experience was so different from a highrise hotel or resort. It was refreshing. I felt like I was getting a real Hawaii experience instead of seeing only touristy attractions.    Shai and Trina are always working to improve the Inn. While I was there Shai and his son were building a pizza oven (see picture). I cannot wait to see what pizzas or other creations Shai will make using the oven. During my visit Shai and Trina were so kind and made me feel like part of their family.

The grounds of the inn are breathtaking, and Shai will show you how to pick ripe lilikoi (passion fruit) right off of the ground where they fall and eat them. Heaven.    They give great directions to wherever you need to go; we never got lost. When we asked about good beaches, Shai recommended Kua Bay, which was exactly what we were looking for.    Shai's breakfasts are delicious and filling without being too heavy, and the coffee is amazing.    What's nice about the inn is that it's in a great location for getting to sights and activities, but it's removed from the hustle and bustle of Kona town. So, after a long day of enjoying the island, you can come back and feel at peace and relaxed (the hot tub doesn't hurt).    We recommend this place HIGHLY.

145566163,50,Another Reason to Love Passionfruit (Lilikoi),"You never quite know what you are going to get at a B&B until you arrive. The Lilikoi Inn is set in a beautiful, lush tropical rainforest and coffee plantation with fantastic views from the lanai out to the ocean. On arrival, Trina made us feel very welcome and we sipped on a delicious fruit smoothie courtesy of Shai as we chatted. We stayed in the Green Papaya room, which is large, comfortable and private. Shai's breakfasts were unsurpassed in excellence, taste and presentation and so varied (& generous) - we did not need to worry about lunch! It is an opportunity to meet with people from all over the world. In September of this year, when we visited, there was a couple from New York, a couple from The Netherlands and we are from Australia.  Trina and Shai are passionate about making their guests time at Lilikoi memorable in every way. Little touches, like Hawaiian music in the background as you dine. They have a kitchen which guests can use for cooking and a fridge. Trina & Shai know all the places that are a must see on the Big Island and you drive off for the day armed with suggestions and directions. Shai told us to ring him if we needed to (we did). Two highlights for us was the Kekai State Park beach and Kiholo Bay, presumably one of the islands best kept secrets, since we saw dozens of turtles, but not tourists.  In summary, if you want a spotlessly clean, quiet, well run, friendly B&B with food to die for, Lilikoi Inn ticks all the boxes. We have travelled extensively and stayed at many B&B's but this one is outstanding and we wouldn't hesitate to recommend it and hope to return some day.",Nov 2012,September 2012,Traveled as a couple,,australia
144418792,50,A Superb Small Inn in Kona Coffee Country,"I was standing on the broad lanai of the Lilikoi Inn, waiting for breakfast to be served and looking out over miles of foliage, flora, and coffee farms. In the distance, I could see the town of Kailua-Kona and, beyond, the blue and sparkling ocean. I heard a footfall behind me and I turned to see a smiling, deeply tanned man walking toward me, extending his hand in greeting. ""I'm Shai,"" he said, ""but only on occasion."" This was my introduction to Shai Yerlick, innkeeper, professional chef, and grower of 100% organic Kona coffee on his three acre farm. His wife, Trina, had greeted us upon our arrival well after dark the night before. Trina and Shai both are filled with energy, good-humor, and enthusiasm. That first morning, Shai served his guests papaya and bananas, grown on the property and topped with yogurt, as well as flavorful homegrown avocado slices with garlic toast, and – for a main course – asparagus frittata. Shai's coffee, harvested and roasted on the premises, is full-bodied yet mellow, with a sweet aroma. His coffee is top of the line, some of the best I've had in years.    My wife and I spent five nights at the Lilikoi, and we have nothing but praise for our hosts and for their inn. Shai and Trina are a fount of reliable information about where to go and what to see and do on the Kona Coast. Apart from our hosts, some of the things I liked best about the Lilikoi were: our spacious room (the Lilikoi Room) and comfortable bed, the very private hot tub a short walk away from the inn, fruit trees and flowers (including orchids) everywhere, and the fully equipped open guest kitchen, where we prepared our evening meals for three nights. I doubt if any restaurant in Kailua has a view as magnificent as the one from the lanai of the Lilikoi Inn: mountainside, sea, the darkening sky, and the distant lights of Kailua.    Would my wife and I return to the Lilikoi? Certainly! Would we recommend the inn to friends and fellow travelers. Absolutely, but only to those who enjoy a companionable B&B experience, and who seek a measure of quiet and beauty at the end of the day, away from the crowded, bustling town.",Nov 2012,October 2012,Traveled as a couple,,"Courtenay, Canada"

143575071,50,Lilikoi means Passion fruit this B&B is passionate about giving guests a great experience!,"B&Bs can be just about anything; so you book one hoping it is great. Don't worry about the Lilikoi! I am still saying it was one of two best decisions I made on my Sept. vacation to The Big Island. The credit for this goes entirely to Shai and Trina. I was looking for a local ""non beach"" focused experience. I was looking for the side of this island that was coffee plantations, and creative arts. The Lilikoi delivered so much more than I expected of any B&B. Everything is very clean, your breakfast is a feast! The attention to detail is intuitive and spectacular. Don't bother coming here if you don't appreciate creativity, food and what the land has to offer. Shai is a trained chef, is multi-cultural (as is Trina) and gets excited about every surprise he can dream up for his guests. I had an agenda of sights to see, and ended up just wanting to relax and hang out at the Lilikoi instead. If you want to know how to get somewhere all you do is ask, he can tell you down to the precise mile marker. My favorite memory, (among many) is his freshly picked from his own land, smoothies. After that, nothing could (or did) go wrong. They are both high energy, gracious senstive hosts that make you feel part of something bigger. Ohana. They can help you make the best use of what ever time you have, but really you should go there to experience non tourist paradise. Sunsets off their shared lanai, (where meals are served) a special touch or arrangement of Hawaiian flora and fauna at every corner. I would call it a ""resort"" B&B. They have a hot tub, that is outdoors easy to use, and surrounded by lush, colorful views of all that is beautiful about natural Hawaii. Shai has even ""invented"" an outdoor shower that blends into the vista. This B&B should be enjoyed as a group experience, from the point of view of having plenty of opportunity to learn from other guest's experiences. Hawaiian music is often in the air, and anything you want to know about how or why KONA coffee is the greatest, Shai can show you every step of the way. If you want to be left alone, say so, right up front. They will respect your wishes but there personalities are ""infectious"" with enthusiasm for being interested in learning from guests and ensuring guests have a ""customized"" trip.

140857874,30,"Beautiful, but we wouldn't go back","We stayed in the Lilikoi Room for three nights in August, 2012. There were some really nice things about the place, but ultimately it felt like visiting your in-laws when they were stressed out and overwhelmed during the holidays. We wouldn't say that ruined our trip, but being in the house was unpleasant and no B&B guest should ever feel like they need to hide from the proprietors to avoid tension. From the other reviews, we can see that other people had entirely different experiences there, but it seemed wrong not to mention ours, since we would not recommend the Lilikoi Inn to friends because of our experiences there.    Pros:    - The Lilikoi Room itself: it was beautiful and airy, the bed was very comfortable, and the bathroom was clean.  - Holualoa is a nice little community - far enough away from the tourist areas to feel more authentic, but close enough that the 10-20 minute drive to restaurants (in either direction) doesn't seem that bad.  - Shai is a great chef, attentive to special food needs and presentation. If food is hospitality, then we appreciated his affection and care. We had to leave for an early flight, and he made us a yogurt/papaya/granola breakfast when he really could have just expected us to go without breakfast.  - We liked the other people who stayed there and the conversations we had with them (communal dining table). I could see this (talking in the morning with strangers) being a drawback for some people, but it wasn't for us.    Cons:    Lack of privacy: Even though the white curtains are double-paneled, the Lilikoi Room is at the corner of the house with a wrap-around porch/walkway that other guests will use on their way from one part of the property to the other and you could still see silhouettes through them. The bathtub and window above it is directly next to this walkway on one side, and the bedroom's long side is next to the other. The room adjoins the main common living room, too, so it doesn't feel like a private place where you could talk freely or enjoy a secluded romantic moment. When you see the beautiful picture of the room on their website (http://www.lilikoiinn.com/photos/bedroom2.jpg), you should know you only get that view if you leave the curtains open and expose yourself to the foot traffic. In other words, if you're heading there for some romance, get one of the downstairs rooms, which seem more private.  Driveway and parking lot: We didn't like that our rental car always bottomed out at the bottom of the hill or that the parking lot (which is just a flat dirt area under trees) was so small and difficult to get into and out of, but we know for our parents--or anyone who is a less-confident driver--that would have been a deal-breaker right there. I know Trina and Shai don't think the driveway or parking lot is a significant problem, but we think that that's a problem in itself.  Lack of clarity in systems: The guest kitchen has very clear systems and expectations, which is really great. Other things, like what to do with your used beach towels (hang them over the railing) or to get new bath towels (they're in the drawers) were less clear. This is simple stuff, but it can be confusing (I wouldn't want to put a used beach towel in common space without asking first).  The ""home"" experience: We really like B&Bs because they can be friendly and welcoming and it can be nicer to be in a home environment (couches! cats! kitchen! other friendly people!) than a more sterile single hotel room. Unfortunately, our time there was really stressful. Trina could be controlling (""you're not going to take that coffee mug into your room, are you?"" when there is no way I would have 1. sat on the bed or 2. put it down anywhere, or ""oh, you're going to [that restaurant]? Really?""), conversation-dominating (she doesn't really let people talk, but usually she's pretty interesting, though), and defensive (you can see that in the response comments to other Trip Advisor posts, and my guess is that she might respond to this one defensively, too). I think the biggest issue we had was with the loud shouting in the common room. Different people communicate in their marriage in different ways, and their weekend we were there was a very stressful weekend for them because they were helping cater a wedding, but you just can't shout and swear at each other when you have guests in your B&B. We think they probably didn't know we were still there because it was about 10:30 in the morning and most people would have set out on their days by then, but it made us feel unwelcome and stressed out. It happened two other times--albeit less loudly and much shorter--later during our stay, so it doesn't seem like it's a one-time thing. In other words, we like to feel included in someone's home and our problem wasn't that it was a B&B-type experience, but that it felt like being included in a really chaotic and tension-filled household where we were actively avoiding interaction with them when they were together. As I said, it really did feel just like visiting your in-laws during a stressful visit.

First of all the breakfast was incredibly good,different every day and generous portions. The location is on the mountain overlooking the Kona coastine (oceanview from the lanai) and the property is surrounded by dense,lush,tropical plants and fruits we could pick and eat right off the tree! You feel like a true Hawaiian. Most important though was the detailed information the hosts gave each guest in planning their daily adventure on the island. They told us how to find the ""hidden Hawaii"", not just the touristy places in all the brochures. Great people, great food, great location!

Shai made AMAZING breakfasts every morning -- I've never stayed at a B&B where we had 2-3 course breakfasts with everything made from scratch. We began with fresh papaya and fruit, kona coffee, juices, then to home made yogurt and granola, to a sumptuous egg tart/ or frittata/ breakfast burrito with pork etc... The hot tub at sunset is super relaxing. We stayed at four places on our trip to the Big Island, and still miss this one. Shai and Trina are an absolutely a delight. (other things to note -- place was super clean, views beautiful, room was spacious -- they even offer a guest kitchen if you'd like to come home and make your own dinner) the views from the lanai are spectacular. Both Shai and Trina are helpful if you have questions about hikes, or day time excursions. I would recommend this and come back again.

136015077,50,Great B&B Experience,"The Lilikoi Inn is a great spot from which to explore the Big Island – highly recommended for honeymooners and families alike!    Before we extol its virtues, we should be upfront about what you are getting at the Lilikoi: if you are looking for the resort experience, then this small B&B is not for you. It is not on the beach, doesn’t have air conditioning, and you’re going to accrue a few mosquito bites. If you’re up for something a little more rustic, then you’re in for a great experience!    The Lilikoi Inn is on a farm about 15 minutes or so from the Kona airport. The most difficult about getting there was the driveway. It’s a little hard to see from the road, which is long and very steep. Drive slowly and carefully and you’ll be fine. The innkeepers are Shai and Trina, and they are incredibly friendly and a great resource for any newcomers to the island. They were able to give us recommendations every day for whatever we wanted to do, be it snorkeling, hiking, or going to the beach. Their recommendations never led us wrong.    The rooms at Lilikoi are comfortable and a little bigger than your average hotel room. Each room has a fan and the temperature was always comfortable, though very damp. Everything worked well in the bathroom and with the lights. There is closet space, extra towels, and a hair dryer if you need them. There are two different lanais on which you can relax and look out over Kailua-Kona and (if the volcanic fog lets you) the ocean. There is also a hot tub that we can help you unwind after a long day of activities around the island.    The biggest highlight from our point of view was the daily breakfast cooked by Shai, who is a fantastic chef. The first morning we sat down to fresh coffee grown on the farm, avocados, and papayas filled with yogurt and berries. We didn’t even consider that there would be a second course, but there was (a delicious omelette with greens from the farm) and it filled us up for most of the day! Every day, Shai whipped up something exciting and tasty. On top of that, if you ask when you book, he’ll cook you dinner one of the nights you’re staying there. Definitely make sure to take advantage of this – we like every single thing we ate at the Lilikoi.    To sum up, if you’re looking for a smaller place to stay with a relaxed atmosphere, we can’t imagine a more comfortable place. The Lilikoi Inn had tons of little perks to raise it above the typical B&B and one major one in the amazing food. Definitely give Lilikoi a try!",Aug 2012,July 2012,Traveled as a couple,,"Washington DC, District of Columbia"
135719742,50,Can't wait to stay at Lilikoi Inn again,"I loved my stay at Lilikoi Inn! Trina and Shai were so hospitable, I felt that I was home away from home (and that's saying a lot because I stayed there for over a week!). I am not usually a morning person, but I actually looked forward to getting up for breakfast to enjoy the peaceful morning on the property and see what Shai was going to prepare for us. My personal favorite was banana pancakes with lilikoi syrup, but I literally enjoyed everything he served. The coolest part is that they actually serve the coffee that they grow on site!    The gorgeous view of the tropical plants around the inn, of Kona and the ocean below is also amazing. Sitting on the lanai watching the sunset is a must! Everything everyone has said about Lilikoi is true- great rooms, lovely view, awesome breakfast. But the warmth and welcome of Trina and Shai are what made my stay completely in the spirit of aloha.

Shai was great with directions and has a large map posted in the lanai to show us exactly where to go.    We were in the Green Papaya room. We enjoyed the downstairs room (not off the main Lanai) for the privacy it afforded when we wanted it. It was very comfortable and clean.    The location was also perfect. It is close to the downtown area, and also easily accessibly to both the north and south spots that we wanted to explore.

It offers a lovely view, comfortable beds, and good showers. But the essence of the inn is the warm atmosphere created by hosts Shai and Trina. They welcome and care for you as if you were family.    Shai's gourmet cooking skills are famous among those in the know, all the more given that he uses his own organically grown fruits, vegetables and eggs. Breakfasts are so hearty, you won't be ready for lunch until well into the afternoon (don't even think about dieting when you're there). Plus, it's served with great sightseeing and travel tips on the side. And don't forgo the excellent coffee, made from beans grown at the Inn.    The hot tub in the midst of their beautiful garden is a delightful way to start or end the day. With so much to do on the Big Island, this is the perfect retreat to make your home base.

130849728,50,Hidden gem in Kona....,"SOME people might want to spend their vacation in Hawaii rolling around with the army of mainland sunbathers in Waikiki and staying in a sterile high-rise hotel. But if you're NOT one of those, you should consider staying in the Lillikoi Inn on the Big Island. It's idyllically located on the side of the Hualalai Loa (inactive!) Volcano, with a sweeping view of the Kailua-Kona bay. The only sounds you're likely to hear will be the sounds of the birds. It's far away enough from the big resorts to make you feel as if you have a chunk of the Big Island to yourself, but close enough that you can still drive to the famous Kona sites in 5-15 minutes (mostly on winding country roads). It only has a handful of rooms (4?) all of which are tastefully appointed, and I think it'd be perfect for couples (though I myself went alone). But the really good things about Lillikoi are the unexpected intangibles.... Shai and Trina (the owners) are terrific hosts -- quite helpful, you won't even need a guidebook to the island if you just sit back and listen to their free-flow of advice. (By the way, Trina is an active practitioner of Hula and can explain the cultural subtleties behind it, as well as other elements of Hawaiian civilization). Also, they're quite warm, it's more as if you are an honorary member of their family (albeit with all the privacy you want) during your stay, rather than a ""customer."" The atmosphere is laid back, and the truly lazy at heart (shame on you -- there's lots to do on the Big Island!) might get lulled into just hanging out on the lanai (terrace), soaking in the outdoor hot tub, and sipping the grown-on-premises Kona coffee. Oh, that reminds me: the property itself is a sort of fertile cornucopia. If you're tired of plastic-looking supermarket produce grown hundreds or thousands of miles away and shipped (genetically modified to stay fresh?) to your town, you'll probably enjoy eating the bounty that grows fresh on the ground of Lillikoi -- bananas (always a massive bunch sitting in the kitchen for you to grab as snack), papayas, avocados... if you haven't had food plucked fresh from the vine and plunked onto your plate a few minutes later, you might have forgotten how good and different it tastes. (By the way, Shai is an expert horticulturalist and will happily give you a botanical tour of the premises.) Another unexpected plus is the breakfast menu, which is imaginative as well as delicious. (Trina and Shai previously ran a catering business in California before staking out their own chunk of paradise on this hill). I remember, among other dishes, a wonderful asparagus omelette, as well as tasty juices, breads (again you might get tempted into indolence after the yummy breakfasts, but don't give in!). Anyway, to wrap up, the cooking, like the rest of the treatment at Lillikoi, is not ""good service,"" it's genuine hospitality, rendered with warmth and flair, and those things can't be faked. Trina and Shai are transplants from the mainland, but they embody the Hawaiian spirit of affability as well as anyone, and their love for their adopted homeland shines forth in their attitude and in the unique B & B they have created.",May 2012,May 2012,Traveled solo,,Chicago

I would definitely stay again!    Being that Shai has an extensive culinary background, our expectations were a little high but he did not disappoint us at all. The food was delicious including the best smoothies I've ever tasted. The breakfast entrees were healthy, delicious, and unique. The selection of local fruit was always ripe and perfect. And the coffee was picked right from their small coffee plantation, so it was guaranteed fresh and tasty.    Shai and Trina were very helpful in selecting local places to visit, and they gave us great directions and descriptions of what to expect. They also have an extensive knowledge of the local restaurants, where to go, and what to avoid.    The room was very spacious, clean and comfortable. The house sits on a hill, so if you get an upstairs room you will get an excellent view from the large picture windows. Or you can go out and enjoy the view from either the upstairs or downstairs lanai.    I do have three criticisms or comments, if you will. The shower in our room had two shower curtains: a regular one, and another one that was hung to hide the window in the shower. It would be nice to have the extra room that the second shower curtain takes up, and it seemed that the extra shower curtain panel attracted a lot of mold (perhaps install some sort of window treatment attached directly to the window). There was also a bit of mold in shower grout. I know it's something that must need constant attention in a humid, tropical environment, but it's worth noting.    The landscaping was very nice. A HUGE selection of tropical plants, fruits, coffee, flowers, etc. It was very nice to peruse and spot all of the different varieties. However, the paths to the jacuzzi and to the car could have been trimmed a little more to prevent having to push through the foliage.    Finally, it's worth noting that Shai and Trina have three pets (two cats and a dog). All of the pets are very friendly and personable. The pets are not allowed in the rooms, but the cats are allowed in the common areas and on the lanai furniture. This is not noted on their website and may pose a problem for people that may be allergic to cat hair.",Apr 2012,April 2012,Traveled with family,,Monterey
128022149,40,Reservations,"So far we have stayed here twice. Unfortunately the customer service appears to have slipped a notch or so. In our recent stay, we heard of at least three guests that had to spend a night in a hotel because their reservations didn't match the Inn's schedule. As for ourselves, we ended up in a room different than the one we'd reserved. Hopefully, Lilikoi will fix these issues promptly because botched reservations are a big deal to people on vacation. The breakfasts here are large as advertised. There's plenty of delicious fresh fruit, Kona coffee, and fresh guacamole. (Yes, guacamole is a breakfast food!) The first few mornings, the egg fritatas were good too. But after several days, the fritatas started to taste a bit bland. Given all the great reviews, we were suprised to notice that Lilikoi doesn't use mattress pads under the sheets or pillow slips. Is this just a Hawaii thing?--we're not sure. Regardless, the beds do sleep good, and that's the important part. If you're ok with the few quirks above, we expect you'll still enjoy this place.

The room we stayed in perfectly accommodated our little family of four. The boys (ages 5 and 8) slept very well on the futons provided for us. Every morning we awoke to a symphony of birds and a very filling, tasty breakfast cooked by Shai - the now infamous cook. Coffee grown on the premises rounded out the morning and we left well-prepared for the day's adventure (Shai and Trina had great recommendations for hikes, beaches and activities too).

The Green Papaya and Plumeria rooms feel more private, but the doors to the common area have open slats--a bit disconcerting for honeymooners.    For being the most expensive room, the Lilikoi room was overly cluttered with vacation guides and other island magazines. The closet also had miscellaneous clutter. Maybe some people like this reminder of home, but we felt it hurt the ambiance.    We did get a chance to enjoy one of Shai's dinners. It was super-creative and completely delicious! Ask about the option if you have the time.

Our entire stay was just incredible.

Everyday he offered us (and we would never turn down) oranges, passionfruit (lilikoi), and the most amazing guacamole ever to take with us for sustenance on our journeys. Oh yeah, and Shai doesn't let any of his guests leave breakfast without an expert consult on their day's itinerary.    Shai and Trina are both warm and enthusiastic hosts.

A professional chef before he relocated to Hawaii, his experience obviously shows. Putting on a very delicious and filling selection of fruit and hot breakfast that gave us plenty of energy for the adventures we would go out on each day.

Among the first things you notice is the amazing view from the terrace.    It was a little bit tricky to find the first time since the tourist maps lacks many roads. Its about a 20 min drive from the Kona airport.    Its located a bit up on the mountainside so the nights are nice and cool.

Shai's breakfast was a delicious feast of tropical fruits and variations of savory dishes made from their farm's produce and kept us stuffed for the rest of the day. Every morning we and especially our kid loved to just get up and go outside to harvest some fresh passion fruits (Lilikoi) or some of those gigantic avocados. Our kid also loved playing with the cats and Shai showed him the chicken that are producing the eggs for the breakfast. He never got bored for a single second and dropped dead in his bed every evening. Besides using the kitchen we appreciated that we could borrow their boogie boards, sunshade and an ice chest.  Shai and Trina made our stay feel like a visit at a good friend's place.

120555340,50,Slice of heaven in the middle of paradise,"I stayed with Shai and Trina for 8 nights - it was a fun and relaxing time. At an elevation of about 1,600 ft. nights are cooler and days never get too warm. The lanai is a perfect plance to put your feet up and read or have a glass of wine while watching the sun set.    Days melt into one another and suddenly you can't remember which day it is or how long you've been there. The temperate climate means you sleep soundly and wake each morning to the best kona coffee on the island - grown in front of the inn, and the best food you will eat while in Hawaii.    The inn sits on a few acres of lush tropical fruit trees and colorful plants. Giant butter avocados that are larger than a softball make their way to the dining table each morning as the most delicious guacamole you've ever tasted! Who would have thought guacamole for breakfast would be that appetizing? Once you've tasted Shai's guac you'll wonder why you haven't thought of it as the breakfast of champions - cereal will forever seem bland and boring. Along with the fresh guacamole, you'll dine on fresh papaya, sweet bananas, grapes, granola, and hot frittatas -- and will be so full you won't be hungry until dinner. It was the best food I ate on the island in 8 days -- hands down.    Shai's culinary skills are equally matched with his hospitality. Trina and Shai both make the inn such a welcome place to stay. Hugs greet you when you arrive, along with fun stories and a wonderful fruit smoothie from Shai. Soak in the hot tub, watch a sunset, nap late into the afternoon and get awakened by the sounds of birds, or possibly the kitten as he scurries on the lanai.    It's a small, quaint, cozy place with delightful hosts and food that is nourishing, delicious, and a labor of love. I will return to share more stories over a delicious cup of coffee..

We enjoyed speaking with them very much. Shai is an excellent chef and breakfast was always an experience - starting with coffee (using their own beans), Shai's ""special"" tea (yum!), the fresh fruit, avocado, and then an imaginative main meal. Whether it was an omelet made from their own fresh eggs or banana pancakes, it was always someting creative and delicious. He also greeted us in the afternoons with fresh fruit smoothies that were terrific.The views from the lanai are breathtaking and the sunsets were awesome. We decided to get take out for dinner so we could sit on the lanai in the evening to watch the sun go down. We stayed in the Lilikoi Room which has a great view (it's not as private as the rooms downstairs) but is beautiful and comfortable. We would definitely stay there again! One Note: The inn is set way up on a hill and the road up is very narrow and steep - guests should heed the owners advice when pulling out of the road to always stay to the left and even if you want to make a right turn, make a left turn instead and then turn around at the next street.

Shai then made us a wonderful, fresh fruit smoothie and then tended to our luggage while we enjoyed the drink and took in the marvelous view of Kona.    The rooms:  The rooms are beautiful, tastefully and functionally designed. I won’t tell you my favorite room because I want it available for our next stay!    The Lanai:  There are two lanais; one for the downstairs rooms with a view of the rainforest, and the main lanai where breakfast is served (there are two rooms downstairs and two upstairs). The main lanai has an incredible view of the Kona coast.    Our hosts:  Shai and Trena are incredible! They have the talent to engage their guests with wonderful conversation, yet still allow complete privacy when desired. Our first morning, Shai provided a “Coffee 101” on how he harvests coffee beans on the property and the whole process of coffee making until it arrives in our mugs at breakfast. I’m talking good coffee here!!    Breakfast:  Breakfast at the Lilikoi is fabulous. It begins with a fresh papaya filled with a variety of things; one day, it’s filled with fresh fruit (including Dragon Fruit!), the next, homemade granola. This first course is supplemented by avocado or passion fruit (Hawaii has the world’s best avocado!). The best part is that a majority of the fruit comes right from the property.    There is a second course following the papaya. One day it was a filling bagel with lox and egg; another day was a frittata and the next, a Hawaiian version of Huevos Rancheros. You will not go hungry after breakfast, and you could probably plan on not having lunch.    Guest Accommodations:  Adjacent to the main lanai is a common area for guests. There are comfortable chairs, a piano and shelves of books. The best part is the guest kitchen. This is not a little kitchenette, this is a full, gourmet kitchen. Range, oven, refrigerator, silverware, glassware, you name it, it’s there. There is also a washer and dryer available to guests. This was a lifesaver for us, as we were rapidly running out of clothes. The first load is complementary, extra loads ask for a very modest fee to offset the utility costs. The fee is definitely worth it for not having to waste time at a Laundromat.    Shai and Trena are also an encyclopedia of where to go and what to do in the area.    There are two cats and a dog on the property and they are the sweetest critters you’ll ever meet.    To give you an idea how special the Lilikoi is, we had non-refundable reservations at the Royal Kona, however, we chose to spend the next day at Lilikoi and ate the cost of the room at the Royal Kona!

Shai and Trina are incredibly hospitable and pointed me towards the best beaches for snorkeling, best restaurants and I even attended a hula class with Trina (I love to dance!). A big plus is the other guests are also very interesting - from around the world - and a pleasure to have breakfast with out on the beautiful lanai. Shai's breakfasts were delicious and nutritious - and it was nice to know that some of the bounty came from their own grounds - the fruit and the eggs from the hens - couldn't be fresher.

First of all, the views are INCREDIBLE. I find it hard to believe that there is anywhere else to stay on the Big Island that even comes close to comparing to the Lilikoi Inn. Walking out onto the Lanai for the first time completely took my breath away -- one gets an incredible panoramic view of the ocean, Kailua-Kona and the beautiful, lush greenery of the west side of the Big Island.    Second of all, it's quiet! Lilikoi Inn is surrounded by farms and private residences -- no tourist or city noise. Nighttime is dark and quiet and during the daytime, you're treated to the noises of animals (chickens, mostly) and nature.    Third of all (most importantly), Trina and Shai are the most AMAZING hosts ever. I've never gone anywhere in the world where I have felt so completely welcome the moment I've arrived! When we arrived, we were treated with a (very much needed) afternoon snack from Shai, allowed to get comfy and situated in our room and both Trina and Shai were available for any questions that we had about the area -- and they were VERY helpful.  Breakfasts here are incredible -- the best that I have ever had, by far. Shai is such a talented chef and it shows every single morning. If I could go back for one reason and one reason only, it would be Shai's cooking.

However, not many travelers may have requested this arrangement as dust bunnies where noted when the trundle was pulled out.    The house has a great lanai (Hawaiian covered porch). Since the property is located at a higher elevation temperatures are cooler then if you were at the coast. We especially enjoyed meeting other guest staying at the Inn who had traveled from Northern Japan.    The Inn can be difficult to find, but if you like seclusion this may be your type of place.

The location is fantastic. It’s the perfect combination of being off the beaten path and away from the crowded touristy areas, but conveniently located within easy driving distance to many of the island’s best attractions. The hosts, Trina and Shai, were so friendly and welcoming plus they had tons of information about what to do on the island. The inn is surrounded by lush jungle landscape and the sunset views off of the back lanai were breathtaking. My room was beautiful and clean. And the breakfasts were amazing!

I can still taste the exotic smoothie he whipped up for us right after we showed up at the Lillikoi Inn. Be sure to ask him for his fruit with home made granola - it is simply out of this world!! Shai also pointed us to the beaches and other spots favored by the locals which were a real treat.

Lastly, no shoes in the house. That took some getting used to since, I never go around barefoot.....ever....ok, to take a bath/shower!    Seriously, that is the bad....not so bad, huh? Oh, wait, there is another bad....they feed you so much (fresh fruit, homemade guacamole, and a hot breakfast too) and it is so good that you might not fit into your swimsuit at the end of your stay. They grow their own coffee and its wonderful....I brought back 5 pounds and wish I would have brought back more.

102796548,50,Great Place to Stay on the Big Island - Highly Recommended,"My wife and I stayed here in early March 2011. Shai and Trina were wonderful hosts and we had an excellent time staying at the Lilikoi Inn Bed and Breakfast and would highly recommend this place to others who are considering a visit to the Big Island. The Inn is a short 15 minute drive from the Kona airport and fairly easy to find. Shai greeted us with a wonderful mango shake which was perfect after a long airplane trip. The Inn sits on a verdant hill filled with coffee plants, passion fruit, avocado, mango, and citrus trees. It's quite pretty and relaxing. Breakfasts were always great with fresh fruit and one of Shai's culinary creations. I especially enjoyed his granola which was excellent. Ripe avocados for breakfast and Shai would pack away some for snacking along the day. We kept quite busy and adventurous during our stay and it was great to start the day off with a nice breakfast at Lilikoi. The Inn is conveniently located and its easy to drive down south or north without gettting caught in the traffic on the main coastal road. After a long day, we often found ourselves going down to Kona town later in the evening for dinner. However, Shai can make dinner for you if you ask in advance. His cooking is influenced by a lot of different cuisines and is excellent. Both Shai and Trina are great resources and will give you lots of good tips about places to visit depending on your interests. The Plumeria room where we stayed was nice and perhaps more private than some of the other rooms. Enjoy your visit to the Lilikoi Inn. It's a great place with wonderful hosts and you'll enjoy staying here.",Apr 2011,March 2011,Traveled as a couple,Plumeria Room - More private room.,"Apex, North Carolina"
102123651,50,Unique B&B - Great for kids,"Wonderful! Wonderful! I completely agree with everything that the first reviewer said about Shai and Trina's hospitality. They literally made our trip. It was our first time in Hawaii and Shai made a point of making sure that we had unique and memorable experiences for each day, charting out with clear directions exactly how to get to that locals only beach where you can swim with the sea turtles or hike to a breathtaking valley where the mountains meet the ocean. (Shai also insisted that we borrow all the snorkel and beach equipment, which saved us a bunch.) And breakfast was some of the best meals we had while on the Island--not to mention their extraordinary organic coffee that they grow on their farm. An added plus was that we were there with our twenty month old toddler and Trina and Shai were great with her-joking around with her and showing her all the animals at the inn. A highlight for her was feeding the chickens and Shai would make just the right coos so the mama hen with her newly hatched chicks came around for our daughter to see. And were lucky to stay in the Plumeria room, where we were able to be in the next room or up on the lanai and still keep tabs on her, which gave us a chance to enjoy some rare private time without having to call a babysitter.

96914688,50,A Hawaiian Garden of Eden for B&B FAns,"Since we have stayed in only one Kona B&B, it might seem presumptuous to pronounce it ""the best"", but that's the call from a couple of B&B fans with a fair bit of experience around the US and Canada. Innkeepers Shai and Trina were very warm and welcoming, and Trina couldn't resist giving us a little hula lesson before we headed off to our luau. Shai is a farmer as well as a generous chef, and it is abundantly clear that he loves what he does, and that means special service for his guests. Breakfast is a hearty treat meaning there was no need for lunch till about 3 pm! Papayas, bananas, lillikoi (passionfruit) and avacodos fresh from the grounds not to mention outstanding coffee, also grown by the innkeeper. Shai and Trina have the commercial kitchen lacking at many Hawaii B&Bs, so the cooked breakfast course is hearty and delicious. The inn is located high up on the mountainside above Kona, making for cool evenings and great sleeping conditions without air conditioning (blanket actually needed). The view from the lanai where breakfast is served is fabulous. The setting is very quiet at night - no traffic and no frogs! Shai told us if we heard any noise during the night it would probably be the wild pigs foraging for avocados. The room (Lillikoi room) was very comfortable (not luxurious) with lots of room for your stuff, including a spacious bathroom with plenty of counter and drawer space.",Feb 2011,January 2011,Traveled as a couple,,"Spokane, WA"

After the ""cook's tour"" or I should say the ""chef's tour"", he offered us a delicious fruit smoothie made fresh from his own lush garden. The Inn is in new condition--the room was exceptionally clean and enormous, with a tiled, walk-in shower.    The Inn’s hillside lanai at 1600 feet in elevation presents a breathtaking view of the Kailua-Kona lights by night and a sweeping panoramic view of the harbor and ocean by day—views fitting for royalty. The grounds offer a lush, slice of native Hawaii with lilikoi, banana, avocado, papaya, coffee and nasturtium plants to name a few. The pictures on their website were probably taken when they first opened the inn. You will be astounded at how quickly the building has become surrounded with Shai's new plantings that grow several feet per year and have created an oasis within a rain forest.    Shai, a trained chef, uses his garden ripe fruits and his own farm fresh eggs to create mouthwatering breakfasts served with his own organic coffee grown on the inn's three acres. When my wife commented she loved avocados, guacamole mysteriously appeared the next morning as one of the breakfast treats. Their butter avocados are just that—creamy and used to butter your toast. Yum! My wife and I are very critical when it comes to finding exceptional meals. Shai’s breakfasts didn’t disappoint—they were superb!    Staying at the Lilikoi Inn is nothing short of a truly amazing experience in paradise with Shai and Trina as your hosts. Their affable smiles and consideration for all their guests as if they were family was refreshing. Their help and assistance exceeded our expectations and came from loving hearts. I loved debating Trina to a draw about a two note singer. What fun! Our experience left us feeling we made new friends for life.    I highly recommend the Lilikoi Inn.

This is the first time that I've ever written an on-line review.    In a word, I would say ...: ""overflowing."" And I should start by pointing out that the photos on the LI website actually DON'T do justice to the overflowing greenness and beauty of the ground's flora and gardens all around the house. (They might be from a few years ago, when the biz was getting started.. ?) Relaxing on the downstairs deck you feel yourself comfortably tucked inside a rainforest!    The views from the upper deck, where you eat, are amazing. Shai is quite simply a genius in the kitchen, brilliantly combining the freshest foods in startling, unimagined ways. (I'm a foodie, w/ a long restaurant background, inc many fine-dining joints in SF and NYC. What a chef! One morning he made us all individual sweet-potato frittatas ~ sublime. One night, a coconut fish soup w/ breadfruit and papaya and a whole lot more~ to die for. Every bite of his salads just burst in the mouth... I don't know how. Shai showed us pictures from past catering preparations, difficult to describe, that were literally works of art, and have changed the way I think about excellence in aesthetic presentation. Unfortunately, our visit didn't coincide w/ one of the themed, monthly feasts they host on Saturday nights~ the trip's only bit of bad luck!) Lady-of-the-house Trina warmly spills her laughter and many languages and stories global and local (she also teaches public school nearby, which is real cool)~ ""shaloha, "" I heard her say, hilariously. It shows. We met and shared the space w/ other guests from all over the mainland, plus an elder woman from South America, and everyone got along famously. These hosts~ who are much more than ""innkepers""~ really and truly care about their houseguests. (Btw, our room was great: comfy, handsome, quiet.)    Everything is overflowing at the Lilikoi Inn!!

Shai and Trina are not only friendly, outgoing and hilarious, but they are also excellent resources for site seeing suggestions. Every day after breakfast, they got out a big map and helped us with our plans for the day. They know all the little spots that most hotels and resorts wouldn't necessarily know or recommend.    3. The house and grounds are lovely. So many different fruit trees, plants and flowers to admire.    4. Fun animals! They have two dogs, two cats, several chickens, a rooster and two goats! It would seem like these pets would make a raucous, but to the contrary...they were quiet most of the time and never made a peep during sleeping hours. But what fun they were when we wanted to play with them. Well, chickens don't want to play, but the rest do!    5. The location is perfect. We were secluded enough that we felt like we were in a remote paradise, but close enough to civilization that we could obtain anything we needed. Also, the little town of Holualoa is absolutely charming! Coffee houses, art galleries, teeny tiny post office, and a few very good restaurants.    My husband and I spent a day at a local, well-known resort as we knew someone that worked there. We were impressed with the resort and it's very ""Disneyland"" feel, but we quickly concluded that we had made the best decision by staying at the Lilikoi Inn.

The location is very convenient approximately fifteen minutes from the Kona Airport and ten minutes from town. But when you are sitting on the lani enjoying a great breakfast and taking in the beautiful views you feel like your a world away. We were there in October and the temperature was perfect for sleeping. The room was comfortable and well decorated.  The owners are very accommodating my wife has a gluten allergy and Shai went out of his way to find a pancake mix that she could have. He also was very good at listening to what we were interested in doing and pointing us in the right direction. Great first impression of Hawaii!

We had only planned to stay one night but ended up staying 3 and would have loved to have stayed more! Shai and Trina made the decision very easy for us. They are lovely people and the property is amazing. On the first day, Shai told us about an amazing (relatively unknown) hike to a waterfall in Waipi'o Valley. This hike turned out to be one of the highlights of the trip and we would have never found it without Shai's help. It was beautiful!! And it was an added bonus to come back and see a spectacular sunset while sitting on the lanai at the Lilikoi about 10 steps from our room. In addition, Shai's breakfasts are amazing, you won't go hungry and he keeps the coffee (beans grown on the property) flowing.

It is spacious, beautifully adorned, and the rooms are spacious, full of light, and clean. I loved conversations with the other interesting guests from all over the world, and our breakfasts were full of laughter. Trina gave me great suggestions of where to snorkle, hike, swim, dine, and shop. Shai makes tasty breakfasts each morning: fresh fruit from their trees, special egg dishes, french toast and other creative dishes. He plants beautiful flowers, coffee, and fruit trees all over the property, and I enjoyed peaceful hot tubs at night. It is a great place to be with your family, mate, or alone.

And there's no better way to wake up than by watching the sunrise from the lanai with a cup of coffee in hand.    Trina and Shai welcomed me with their jokes and friendly demeanors. They know everything about the Big Island -- what beaches are the best, what hikes are worth doing, and what sites one should see.    The house itself is very modern. The room was big and had a full private bathroom. The bed was one of the best I've slept on. They also had complimentary wi-fi and a computer to use, which was helpful to check emails.

What an understatement! The Inn and its setting in the coffee growing district overlooking Kailua in the distance are just breathtaking. The facilities are very well kept, but the best part of our trip was the warm reception and personal attention we received from Shai. Each morning, we anticipated Shai's delicious breakfasts on the lanai, serenaded by the local aviary. After breakfast, Shai helped us plan each day of sight-seeing with tips on restaurants and points of interest, which we appreciated. Unfortunately, Trina was away during our stay, and we regret not having met her.    Noting how fascinated we were by the beautiful tropical flora surrounding the Inn, Shai gave us tours of his landscaping projects. So much is being said these days about sustainable living, but we don't often get the chance to experience it and see it in action. Shai has put his knowledge of agriculture, plants and conservation to good use at Lilikoi Inn, and we could see the love he has for the Earth through the beauty surrounding the Inn.    If you want to connect with the beauty and serenity of Hawaii, plan your next stay in Kona at the Lilikoi Inn with Shai and Trina.

I had such a phenomenal time during my first visit that I had to come back to experience more of the beautiful views, comfy quarters, tasty food, and lively hosts. To say the least, I was not at all disappointed by my choice to return.    The Lilikoi in the perfect getaway for travelers who want to experience the fine hospitality of the Big Island. Owners Trina and Shai are the warmest hosts and have a stunning home to share with travelers. The Inn has a beautiful lanai that overlooks the entire Kona coastline. This wonderfully designed porch is particularly spectacular at sunset. I enjoyed may hours on the lanai taking in the view, reading, playing chess and smelling the fresh coffee growing all around the Inn.    The guest rooms make you feel right at home. Everything you need for a pleasant stay is well within reach. I can guarantee that you will be able to rest easy in this beautiful paradise.    The quality of the food at the Lilikoi Inn sets it apart from other BBs that I have stayed at in the past. Shai is a magnificent cook who used to own a catering business in the San Francisco Bay Area. Since moving to Hawaii, he has infused the natural flavors of the island into many of his dishes that are simply to die for! If you like fresh banana bread, this is certainly the place to stay...I couldn't get enough.    I would certainly recommend the Lilikoi in to anyone who wants to get the most out of their Hawaiian vacation.

The place has the feel of staying with your favorite relatives, from the amazing food that Shai prepares daily (I still fantasize about the fresh egg frittata and Shai's special spicy sauce), to the wonderful stories they regale you with. It was a great home base to come back to and take a dip in the hot tub after all our adventures on the island. I was really sad to go.

Our breakfasts each morning consisted of the freshest fruit, eggs, avocado and juice that were all from the property and were masterly prepared by Shai the chef . The Kona coffee was made from coffee beans harvested on site and was delighful as well, according to my husband. I do not drink coffee, so Shai made me herbal tea each morning instead. Trina and Shai gave us suggestions on which beaches we should go to and sights we should see. We were made to feel at home, and the location was just secluded enough to be very relaxing, yet only about 15 minutes away from Alli Drive, for shopping, etc. We definitely recommend The Lilikoi Inn for a great experience on the Big Island and look forward to returning to see Trina, Shai, Lilli, Nanny, Teddy, and Decaf again!",Jun 2010,June 2010,Traveled as a couple,,"Manchaca, Texas"

Trina has advised us where to go for snorkling and other adventures. Her husband and co-owner, Shai, has prepared an incredible breakfast.

They had anything you might need (beach towels/chairs, boogie boards, kitchen access, DVDs, laundry, books, games and more.) Shai was so friendly and helpful.

You really feel as though you've come to a second home in paradise with the pampering and personal attention.    We booked the Lilikoi room on the second floor where the breakfast lanai and guest kitchen are located. The room was tastefully appointed, even with a fresh tropical bouquet to welcome our stay including fresh fruit smoothies made by Shai.    The breakfasts started with delicious coffee made from their home grown beans and fresh tropical fruit. The banana pancakes, served with homemade lilikoi syrup were the best I've ever eaten!!!! From the frittata to other creative, delicious dishes we were always  impressed with Shai's culinary skills. We had the pleasure of joining them for one of their monthly special dinner's. This month it was a 5-course Indian dinner, complete with authentic live music. The food was marvelous and we thoroughly enjoyed meeting some of their friends from the island.    It was very obvious to us that both Shai and Trina enjoyed making their guest's stays memorable. We can't wait to return to the Lilikoi Inn.    Big hugs and thanks for a fantastic experience.

We actually ended up changing our plans for the last days of our trip so we could stay for a couple more nights at the Lilikoi Inn.

63937529,30,Nice and personal,"This is a B&B high up on the hills above Kona. It'll take you around 15 minutes to drive downtown. It's a big house with the guest rooms facing in towards a common area, with the owners living on the other side of that common area. There is also some basement rooms, with their own common area and lanai (porch). The two owners are very personal and accommodating, Shai would love to talk to you all day, Trina seemed a bit stressed out when we were there. Breakfast is very very good, and is served outside around a big table you share with all the other guests. We didn't eat dinner there, but I'm sure it's just as good. Probably some of the better food you'll find in the Kona area.    Overall this place feels like a big family house, which is great if you want to meet the other guests, talk to Shai (and maybe Trina), and feel like you're experiencing ""authentic Hawaii"" (as opposed to living in a megaresort, or chain hotel). It's not so great for privacy, relaxing all by yourself and so forth.    The rooms are nice and clean, but the backside of the house, the common area and the common kitchen was pretty messy, with a lot of dirty dishes and miscellaneous stuff spread out everywhere. Again, very personal like your own house, but some of you might like it more impersonal, like a hotel.    This place would probably really work for you, or you might be slightly put off by it, depending on the level of privacy you'd want.",May 2010,May 2010,Traveled as a couple,,"Salt Lake City, Utah"

63282972,50,Quiet relaxing environment,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Lilikoi Inn for 3 nights at the beginning of our vacation to the Big Island and Kauai and I wish we'd stayed longer. This house is located at a higher elevation than the touristy Kailua-Kona and is therefore very refreshing and a lot cooler. The hot tub feels wonderful at night. When we were there, there was only one other couple there that were actually old friends of Shai and Trina. We didn't see too much of Trina, but Shai made us feel incredibly welcome and comfortable. He was completely laid back and was nice enough to send us off on our day adventures (to which he recommended good beaches/snorkeling spots/restaurants and drew us maps!) with goodies such as bananas from his own trees, leftover homemade guacamole from breakfast, and other assorted fruit. My boyfriend is a picky eater AND doesn't drink coffee so he accomodated his individual needs and even brewed him some fresh hot tea made from herbs that he grew. Our room was located on the main lanai, but I'd choose a room on the lower lanai for more privacy next time. Shai encouraged the use of the kitchen (there is one kitchen for guest use with everything you might need to cook, and an industrial kitchen that he uses) which we never ended up using, but I bet if you did he'd probably give you cooking tips since he is a chef and owned a catering business for 14 years, I believe! He said to us, ""I was hoping you'd cook something so I could make fun of you"" (all in good fun!).

The Lilikoi Inn provided a lush, beautiful, welcoming home away from home for us, one we hope to return to many times. I somehow lost our written directions, but Shai answered the phone and gave us easy to follow directions to the Inn. When we arrived he offered us a delicious smoothie made with fresh lilikoi fruit and banana bread made from their banana tree! WOW! Shai cut a hibiscus for me, which I put in my hair. That's when I knew I was in Hawaii!    We stayed in the tastefully decorated Green Papaya room, with a modern, comfortable bathroom, huge closet with hangers and a comfy sleigh bed with lots of pillows There is also lovely furniture with drawers so I could organize all my clothes and really live there. The room had many towels, both for showering and taking to the beach and hot tub. The lower lanai has a hammock big enough for 2, table and chairs where I could relax and write in my journal. The upper lanai was a great place to meet others, enjoy magical sunsets and eat Shai's gourmet meals and snacks. We're still talking about the size of the avacado Shai used to make an endless bowl of guacamole.    Trina and Shai, made us feel at home and cared for with their wonderful sense of humor and extensive knoweldge of their beloved Island. They gave us choices and directions for fun places to spend our time. They recommended beaches, lent us snorkling equipment and even let us use their kayak, which Shai drove down to the beach and then hung out while we enjoyed a long paddle. They told us about the Merrie Monarch, a yearly hula festival that takes place in Hilo, and told us we shouldn't miss it. Trina dances in a hula troop and showed us beautiful feather pieces and shell necklaces which she had made for her costume. We did go to the festival and were blown away by the talent and majesty of the event, which was free on the first night. This was the real Hawaii, not the one conjured up for tourists. They even lent us sleeping bags and blankets so we could go camp on the Hilo side when we went to see Volcano park.    There is a grand piano, which I played, in the living room. We used the guest kitchen to store and cook some of our own meals. It had everything we needed. We loved relaxing in the hot tub, which is hidden away amongst the lush plants, flowers and coffee trees of the property. My sweetheart bought 2 pounds of Shai's coffee to take home.

62041873,50,Great Hosts and a Great Hideaway!,"My husband and I had the pleasure of staying at the Lilikoi Inn the first week of November in the Green Papaya Room. Trina was home to greet us on our arrival. She showed us our room, the adjoining shared lounge, the lanais—both downstairs and up—the guest kitchen, and other property highlights. She also served us some of Shai’s fresh made lilikoi juice—our first glass of many .    Accomodations - The room was large and beautifully appointed, not overcrowded or kitschy. The color scheme was a lovely matte green with black furnishings. The bathroom was a nice size as well with a large updated shower. There were two sets of French doors and one set of sliding glass doors out to the porch and grounds. We loved having all these openings to see the beautiful property and ocean views beyond. We were also a short walk to their hot tub; a nice secluded spot for a late night sunset while unwinding from a trip to the beach.    Meals - As with all the other reviews, we cannot say enough great things about the awesome meals Shai prepared—starting each morning with fresh fruit served in sweet Hawaiian papaya bowls, fresh from the garden avocados, and home grown and roasted Kona coffee, to deliciously sweet banana pancakes, to wonderfully made quiches and frittatas, to name a few . We were celebrating my 30th birthday on the island, so my husband, with the help of Shai and Trina, secretly arranged for a birthday dinner and flowers prepared by Shai himself. It was such a great surprise! The flower arrangements and 5-course meal were one I’ll never forget and at such a great price, I’m so happy we stayed “inn” and not spent time out that evening.    Misc. - Aside from calling ahead to determine availability, I also inquired about their other amenities to make sure I only brought/bought what I needed. They had a few items we were able to borrow for the beach and space to store/make some light meals of our own. Along with your sun block, don’t forget to bring mosquito repellant! They both know a lot about the island, so don’t be afraid to ask for suggestions on beaches, roads, or restaurants, or just to talk! Their directions on their website from the airport are spot on, just be on the look out and take the turn up the hill slowly.

57593144,50,"Beautiful room on a small coffee plantation, out in the REAL Hawai'i","We absolutely loved the Lilikoi Inn. The owners, Trina and Shai, love their island, and are happy to pass on their enthusiasm and their knowledge of Hawai'ian culture and agriculture. They have many years of experience as caterers and restaurateurs, and a marvelous sense of humour. I'm pretty shy, but I really felt totally at ease with them, and loved it when they had time to talk with us at breakfasts. And, WOW! What breakfasts they were!!!! Wayyyyyy too much tasty food, and something different every day.    I brought a couple of pounds home of their coffee - so mellow and smooth, and brought from the tree to the cup by Shai's own hands - he roasts the beans in a long-handled wok, just a small amount at a time. He's happy to show you exactly how it's done, too, which is so cool.    The room was beautifully appointed, with some really neat pieces, spacious, and with a bathroom with a lovely travertine shower, and an adjoining sitting room. There were two lanais - one upstairs by the guests' kitchen and livingroom, overlooking the sea, and one on our level, which was surrounded by beautiful plantings and coffee trees.    We'd never been to the big island before, so we were delighted that Shai and Trina were able to show us on the map each morning which places we should check out for the best snorkeling or hiking or shopping or eating.    We used the Lilikoi as our home base each day, and had no days that we felt we'd spent too much time on the road, though we circled the entire island by the end of our week. When we wanted to go out for dinner after getting home from a trip across the island, we were only 15 minutes away from Kailua-Kona and all the shopping we could want.    And when we wanted to get away from it all, there we were in sleepy Holualoa, up the drive through the coffee trees and papayas and the wild chickens strutting their stuff on the roadside.

They will share their home with you like you have been expected and missed. They graciously answer your questions and share their knowledge of the island and thier coffee forest and their cooking and their insights into the local scene - and as if by some strange instinct - they know exactly when to step out of sight and allow you to enjoy the hot tub, a lounge on the lanai or a nap on your comfy bed.

55906875,50,Lilikoi Inn is a hidden gem,"We stayed here for the first three nights of our vacation and the last night of our vacation. For the first part of our stay we were in the Lilikoi Room and we spent the last evening in the Green Papaya Room.  Both rooms are nicely decorated and clean. If you are traveling with someone that is light-sensitive, I would pick the Green Papaya room. It is downstairs, darker curtains and quieter (unless you have heavy walkers above you in the Lilikoi Room). The Green Papaya has a tiled, stand-up shower. The Lilikoi Room is brighter with white curtains. The bathroom has a tub/shower. Both rooms offer comfortable beds. Lots of hot water.  We traveled with our 4 year old son. Trina and Shai are very accommodating hosts and children are welcome. It is a safe place for kids with lots of little garden places to explore. The hot tub is about 40 steps from the house and tucked away that you don’t have to worry about little ones falling in. The hot tub is clean and a nice treat at the end of the day. The lanais surrounding the house have good railings and there isn’t a chance that a child could slip through.  The place is very peaceful and calming. Shai puts their rooster to bed at night, so you are not awaken by the on-site rooster. In fact we were never awaken by barking dogs or roosters. Walls are thin, but everywhere is like that in Hawaii.  I liked this place because I felt like I was experiencing a bit of Hawaii rather than a resort. Trina is a wealth of cultural and snorkelling information about the Island. Shai will even set you up with kayaks for some exploring on your own. These hosts will bend-over backwards to make sure your time at Lilikoi is exactly as you need it to be.  Food is outstanding! If you get a chance, take the hosts up on their offer of an evening meal. $40/person is well worth it. Shai catered in Berkeley for years and his talent for taste, presentation and heaping services is something not to be missed.

Within seconds of meeting us, Shai had balanced my partners suitcase atop his head and gave us the grand tour, while pointing out all the fresh fruit trees, and assuring us we'd sample the harvest during our stay.    Every morning we awoke to a stunning fare of breakfast, a great infusion of locally harvested fruits, organic eggs, and their former lives in the catering and dining industry show through the fritatas, fresh guacamole and other sumptuous desserts.    After breakfast, we'd chat quickly about our goals for the day, and Shai and Trina were quick to give directions, make alternative suggestions, or provide snacks for our daily excursions. We found their local knowledge of the people and the area to be great.    In the evening, as much as I loved exploring the island, I wanted even more to head back to the inn to watch the sun slip below the horizon while sitting on the Lanai and (more often than not) enjoy a smoothie brought to us simply for being in the house.    The Lillikoi Inn was the perfect end to our two week vacation, I wish I had more time in Kona, but I've left many things to accomplish and plan on returning. I cannot see how I would want to stay anywhere else on any subsequent trip, or would advise any personal friends to inquire elsewhere. Simply put the value of service and condition of the rooms was well worth the daily rates.    A few general notes that are very useful if you are spending time at this B&B:    * There is a full kitchen available with plenty of space in the fridge and an ample stocking of leftover basic-needs cooking ingredients (sugar, flour, oil, spices, etc.) Shai and Trina have a separate commercial kitchen that breakfasts are prepared in.  * The coffee is excellent, some of the best of the 100% Kona I tried while on the islands, so if you enjoy coffee, plan on picking up a pound to bring home!  * Breakfasts are very hearty, there is more than enough food to either use as leftovers for lunch, or in some cases, we simply skipped lunch.  * You're minutes from town, but far enough that your closest (audible) neighbors are the local wildlife.  * The driveway is steep, but well paved and completely do-able in any of the compact 2wd rentals (such as we had.) just swing left or right when exiting to avoid touching bottom for the car.  * there was some leftover snorkel gear from past visitors that I took advantage of, worked fine, and saved me the hassle of renting gear in town.  * Between the hot-tub, upper and lower Lanais, and the common living room and kitchen, there is plenty of room even when the place is booked to feel like you're on your very own getaway, or be as sociable as you like.    If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to contact me, I'm more than happy to discuss my new favorite place to stay.",Jan 2010,January 2010,Traveled as a couple,,"Boston, MA"

After being greeted by Trina, I was introduced to Teddy and Lili (the B&B’s amazingly cute and playful pet residents). I was then shown to my large, clean and tastefully decorated room; the Lilikoi in is a very well thought-out four room B&B which takes full advantage of the remarkable views and surrounding land.    After settling in, Shai showed me around. The property features a hot tub overlooking the ocean, avocado trees, lilikoi vines, guava trees, chickens (which lay tasty fresh eggs for breakfast), coffee plants, great landscaping and a ton of other plants with Hawaiian names I can’t remember.    Every morning I had the privilege of sitting down to remarkable, Shai created, breakfasts (Quick note – Shai was a full time chef back in the SF Bay Area). Although the breakfasts ranged from fresh fruit salad served in a papaya to frittata, the one constant was the great deliciousness of each meal. Each breakfast was served with fresh roasted coffee from beans picked just beyond the lanai.    Trina always gave me great advice for which beaches, hikes, restaurants… to visit. Check out Waipio Valley, it’s ridiculously beautiful.    I had an amazing vacation and by the end of the trip I felt like family. Shai, Trina, Teddy, Lili, the chickens and guava trees were great hosts and I can’t wait to return for my next Hawaiian adventure.",Jan 2010,January 2010,Traveled solo,,Berkeley

It is just a short drive to the ocean for a nice lazy day spent on the beach.    The food is magnificent as Shai is very passionate about his cooking!

You get fruits and veggies from the own garden and if you are there in the right season even your coffee is home-grown. Therefore the breakfast you get every morning, is one of the highlight every day. Don’t you dare to miss it.  There are no visible neighbours and you can't hear the road. You think you are in the middle of nowhere. But is only a five minute drive and you are in ""downtown"" Kona.  The rooms are very nice decorated and spotless clean. But the real hit is the separate hot tub in the garden. The views from there are outstanding. The pictures you see on their and this homepage really give a good impression of the place.

I should preface this by saying we're B&B devotees with very high standards. We wanted a B&B that was out of the touristy fray, had a seriously substantial (and delicious) breakfast and that had rooms that were tidy and kitsch free. So, to say that the Lilikoi met our standards would be an understatement. Shai and Trina are exceptional hosts, hysterically funny, attentive and 100% committed to making sure that one's stay at the Lilikoi Inn is nothing short of perfect. Our room was beautiful and comfortable, and a stones throw from the hot tub-- bonus. Shai's cooking is outstanding! It was a real treat to know that a good portion of each day's breakfast came from Shai and Trina's 3 acre property tucked in the hills. Also worth noting-- Shai and Trina sometimes host dinners for guests...if you have an opportunity to partake, do! (I think all one needs to do is ask, the food is divine!!) We were treated like family and there was no question that went unanswered. ""Where's the best place to snorkel?"" ""Where's the best local sushi place?""

39797172,50,Wonderful Stay - Best Breakfasts,"Recently spent 2 nights at the Lillikoi Inn with my wife. It was our first time on the Big Island and the first time staying at the Lilllikoi Inn. What a wonderful find - we found this place by researching the reviews on tripadvisor. The inn is in the up country above Kailua-Kona with a great view of Kailua-Kona and the ocean - great sunset views. The house was warm and inviting, the rooms clean and comfortable, with a beautiful lanai surrounding the house and extending to an outdoor ""dining room"".    The owners - Shai and Trina - are wonderful, friendly people transplanted from the Bay Area. Shai, originally from Israel, is an incredible chef (apparently he used to have a catering business) and by far the best part of the stay at the Lillikoi Inn were the incredible breakfasts we had on each of the 2 mornings of our stay. From the freshly squeezed lillikoi (passion fruit) juice, to the home grown avocado's made into a wonderful guacamole dip, to the excellent omelettes and incredible french toast we really felt we were being terribly spoilt.

39386305,50,A touch of paradise,"We drove up to a beautiful home and were welcomed with a glass of lilikoi juice (passion fruit juice). This was the beginning of three amazing days.    We were welcomed into a large beautifully decorated living room (it had a a lovely piano in it). Our room was right off the living room. It was a very large room tastefully decorated. I really loved the painting of the lilikoi vine and flowers. We also had a lovely private bathroom. Our teenagers were right next door. Their room had two beds and their own private bathroom. Each room had their own TVs, there were many books to read and lots of music CDs to listen to. There was also a small kitchen were guests could do some cooking. We just used the fridge. Hope the next guest enjoyed some our beers and diet cokes.    It felt like we were invited to be members of this family. The husband, Shai, appears to offer dinner to his guests once a week. We had a delicious meal of curried chicken, rice and green papaya salad. Everything was cooked to perfection. Even the setting was idyllic. They have a very large lanai (veranda) off the living room. It has views of the ocean. A romantic setting for a romantic meal, of course we had two teenagers.    The wife, Trina, was very friendly and gave us advice on what to do. She lent us flash lights to go see the volcano. She recommended a place to go snorkeling that was not in our trusted guide book (Big Island Revealed). This turned out to be the best coral we had ever seen. We have snorkeled in many places over the years, but this place was special. We even got to swim with dolphins and turtles. The beach she recommended was near the one that the guidebook recommended. We checked out both beaches. She was right, the one she recommended was better.    The breakfasts alone make this my favourite B&B. The first morning we had lilikoi juice (I am still dreaming about that juice) and fresh omelets. They have their own chickens and you can really taste the fresh eggs. Someone in our family must have told them it was my birthday on a second day. They made a great fuss of me. We had french toast with lilikoi syrup. My only birthday wish is to be able to come back often, to be able to stand and watch the sunset from the lanai again while drinking yummy lilikoi juice.    I can't end this review with out mentioning Teddy, a beautiful brown dog, who allowed us to hug and pat him endlessly.

Because of her guidance, I had a truly magical experience swimming with dolphins and sea turtles on a remote black-sand beach.    I hope to come back and visit the Lilikoi Inn again.

Shai also gave us a great tour of his grounds, and has wonderful knowledge of agriculture that he shared. It was wonderful to drink a cup of coffee grown from the coffee trees you could see outside his deck.    I would say this is an AMAZING place to stay if you are a solo traveler, because the family is very welcoming and you will never feel lonely. If you are a couple, I'd personally recommend asking for one of the downstairs rooms, which seemed more private to me and have updated baths. The upstairs room, that we were in, is lovely, but felt a bit open for us as we were on our honeymoon. But of course if we were really concerned about privacy we should not have been staying at a BnB! Overall, we had a lovely time and thought Shai was a lot of fun.

I went to hawaii to follow the pods, as my name suggests I have a bit of an affinity for whale-watching, and never have I seen such spectacular specimens! April is the time to go to Kona, and the Lilikoi inn is the place to stay.  I was recommended this gettaway by a friend and I have to say the Lilikoi Inn exceeded my wildest expectations. It is located at the top of beautiful vista in Kona--from the back porch a stunning view of the sparkling ocean is visible and we caught more than a few precious sunsets from that veranda. A quaint location, a stay at the Lilikoi allows you to escape the hordes of tourists at a beautifully furnished B&B.  Fresh eggs and coffee grown on the property is an added bonus, and the trees at that time of year hung heavy with ripe fruit--the taste of the avocados, picked fresh daily, will remain in my memory for years to come.  Your hosts will take great care of you, offer advice on nearby secluded beach coves (a short drive away) or where to find local cultural hot spots such as hoola shows.

From its perfect location high on the mountain overlooking Kona's perfect sunsets to its large, comfortable and well appointed rooms (each decorated around a tropical theme), this bed and breakfast is simply put, perfection on earth.    One can while away the hours on the enormous varandah (or lanai) listening to the sounds of the mountain forest calling or wander the perfectly lush grounds, brimming with tropical fruits and colours.    Proprietors Trina and Shai have created this slice of heaven with the guests' comfort and pleasure in mind.

She'll guide you to the best beaches and viewing spots around the island. She'll lend a helping hand in understanding local traditions and music and she has included everything a traveler looking to relax at the inn will ever need. Staying at the Lilikoi Inn is more like staying with family than being a guest at some quaint B&B for this is no ordinary inn.    In Hawaiian, lilikoi is a passion fruit and the Lilikoi Inn reflects the fruits of the proprietor's passion for their business: your total enjoyment, relaxation and the pursuit of inner peace.

My mother and I stayed here 5 nights, and it was perfect for our type of holiday: Every day we went for morning neighborhood walks, drove to a different beach for snorkelling (Trina will give you the run-down on the best snorkelling spots), and returned in early evening to cook ourselves dinner. I ate so much fruit, especially lilikoi, I was in *heaven*! In the evenings we'd fix ourselves a candle light dinner on the veranda and watch the lights of Kailua wink on as the evening settled. Then relax in the hot tub before watching a movie (there's a large collection in the house).    We liked being away from the tourist bustle in Kailua, loved hearing nothing more than the quiet of birds and leaf rustles, and it is refreshingly cooler in the hills than by the beaches. Since we drove to a different beach every day, it did not matter to us that we were 10 minutes up the hill from the town area.

22472468,50,A Bed and Breakfast in Hawaii's Garden Of Eden,"As a clinical psychologist working a consultant for Kaiser Medical Center, I had occasion to visit the Big Island of Hawaii for a week. I was advised by some of my friends to stay at the Lilikoi Inn in Holualoa, a pleasant little district up the hill from the city of Kailua-Kona. The Inn is a picturesque, sunny yellow house run by two lovely people, Trina and Shai. First let me tell you about the place: its like living in homey back-woods cabin with a shimmering beach view surrounded by the Garden of Eden. The view is spectacular off of the @ 50-foot lanai (fenced in balcony). what is even more fun is looking down from the lanai onto the 3-acre garden of fruit trees and coffee that have been carefully cultivated by Shai. This man is amazing. He and his wife Trina decided a couple of years ago to leave his restaurant and catering business in Berkeley and move to the Island of Hawaii. He originally comes from Israel where he worked on a Kibbutz and eventually was trained as a professional chef. Not only are his breakfasts amazing but he spends much of the day slowly and carefully cultivating a garden out of what once was a wild, primitive coffee field. During a very memorable walk around the plantation I saw a grassy glen, easy-to-pick tropical fruit trees, meditation spots located under shady trees, and a glorious hot tub embedded in a roofed-over deck surrounded by Hawaiian vegetation. The man, like his wife, is a very peaceful, earthy individual. And he cooks! Shai built for himself an industrial sized kitchen and like the alchemists of old he works in there and comes out with a treasure of yummy dishes. During my visit a young newly-wed couple had come in one night and Shai made them a sumptuous â?ohoneymoon dinner. The accommodations are very homey, clean and tasteful. And a real bonus for me was the fully outfitted community kitchen they provide to guests. I was able to save a little on restaurants by cooking up some of my own dinners and storing left-overs in the fridge. As some of you might know, Hawaii is a very hot place. I found the micro-climate of the Inn perfect since the higher you go up the hill the cooler it is (by about 8-10 degrees). The more temperate weather also makes dipping into their hot tub a welcome pleasure. Its quiet and serene environs are a welcomed relief after a day of high-stress consultation for Kaiser. All in all, this experience convinced me to avoid â?"" at all costs â?"" the usual hotel scene and switch to a bed-and-breakfast such as the Lilikoi Inn during my visits. I hope that you will take advantage of this beautiful place when you come to Kona.",Dec 2008,August 2008,Traveled on business,,San Francisco
22271335,50,A welcome find,"When another accommodation we were staying at did not work, we scrabbled around to find an alternative for our last night in Hawaii. I'm so glad we found this place! We received such a warm welcome and were offered lovely fresh guacamole made from avocados from their land just after our arrival. That got things off to a good start. If you like good food, this is a great place to stay. Breakfast on their lanai was wonderful too and we really appreciated the frittatta that Shai made for us and had enough for leftovers for later at the beach.    The Inn has a lovely clean and new feel but is also warm and welcoming. We stayed in the Lilikoi suite which had a large private bathroom and was very comfortable. The location would be perfect for trips to the beaches on this coast and even though the inn is situated at an elevation, it's just minutes to get to some of the best spots. I wish we had discovered this place sooner as it would have made a great base.    We really appreciated the peace and quiet. I was a little concerned with it being Thanksgiving and having family around that there would be noise, but the owners were perfectly respectful and it was blissfully peaceful.    Oh, and the hot tub too with it's spectacular views also helped us quickly relax as we watched the beautiful sunset.    I think what I really valued the most is that although this is a relatively new accommodation, the owners were clearly detail oriented and cared greatly about their guests' comfort. Trina even asked me if we had any suggestions to make things better - I found that quite refreshing although I had little to suggest.",Nov 2008,November 2008,,,San Francisco
21477983,50,Blissful Hawaiian Inn,"We came to the Big Island for the Ironman Triathalon and choose to stay at the Lilikoi Inn for one week. The Inn is new and was thoughtfully designed by its owners, Shai and Trina, a warm and friendly couple from California. The Inn is located in the midst of a lush coffee plantation and we woke up each day to singing birds and beautiful sweeping views of the Kona Coast. Shai is an professional chef and makes delicious and visually beautiful breakfasts every morning that are served on the Inn's large Lanai (Hawaiian porch). Shai and Trina meet guests on the Lanai each morning and answer questions about where to go and what to do on the Big Island. (Trina is very involved in the community and knows the local people, businesses and events). Our room was spacious with comfortable beds and linens and the bathroom was well-designed with stone and tile in warm earth colors. In addition to being a chef, Shai also enjoys working the land and has landscaped the Inn with an amazing array of flowering plants, vines and ferns. Lush landscaping surrounds the hot tub, which overlooks the plantation and the Kona coastline. The Inn is up the road from the Holualoa artists colony and is a 15 minute drive from beautiful sandy beaches. My husband and I travel a lot and prefer to stay at boutique hotels or small inns...we enjoy personal attention in smaller, eclectic settings, and the Lilikoi Inn fits the bill!!",Nov 2008,October 2008,Traveled as a couple,,"Berkeley, CA"
