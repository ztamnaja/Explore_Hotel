862686261,40,Disappointed,The view was breathtaking. -ocean front !  But maintenance was lousy - reported problem the day after (first noticed late the first night)  Second shower was not usable  Someone came and couldn’t repair. Maintenance manager came the next day and said we’d all 4 adults would have to use the one in the master and that was the last we saw of help -never heard from anyone again about repairing it  Paid for a 2/2 and used as a2/1,Sep 2022,September 2022,,,
799370156,50,Beautiful Place to Stay,"My family and I have stayed at the Aston-Whaler property every year for the past five, (save 2020, the year of the pandemic). Every stay has been wonderful. The staff has always been friendly and very accommodating. The rooms are clean and the bedding is very comfortable. The view from the oceanfront rooms is unbeatable. I highly recommend this property!",Jul 2021,July 2021,,,Ontario
861072341,50,Kaanapali Vacation,"Best location in Kaanapali for walking, golf, beach, etc. Whaler's Village right next door offers all the shopping needs for a family vacation. Soft sand beach, big waves for body surfing and boogie boards. Good surf break just down the beach. Snorkeling at Black Rock",Sep 2022,September 2022,,,"Vancouver, Canada"
860813425,50,First time at The Whaler,Super experience!!!  Will return because everyone was so friendly and accommodating. Had quite a few questions about several items and they were all answered. I had never stayed in this type of accommodation before and it was an enlightening experience.,Sep 2022,September 2022,,,"Albuquerque, New Mexico"
859797811,50,Return to Maui,Encountered no problems during stay or departure. Whaler’s location is great.  The staff is very helpful and friendly including the attendants at the beach.  This trip was our third visit to Maui and second time at the Whaler.,Sep 2022,August 2022,,,
859491511,10,Poor service and feedback,"I stayed from 4th to 7th Sep. I was really disappointed of your service. While I stayed, you had never offered us house-keeping service. And even when my wife asked a house-keeping boy of an additional towel, he said our room was not possible to get one. (He shaked his head and said 'not your room'.)  I think it was because of my poor English.  When I asked one of my friends whoes husband is from Maui about this problem, she said it was not usual case. What do you think? It was our honeymoon. But you ruined everything. Put yourself in someone else's shoes!",Sep 2022,September 2022,,,"Seoul, South Korea"
859152617,20,disappointing,"Make sure to choose a hotel not this mixed timeshare mess. The staff are rude, unhelpful and following the quietly quitting trend. The mattress was nearly as old as me… with a solid 2” from one side to the other of the bed. Such a strange weird setup… i’ll not need to do this again",Sep 2022,August 2022,,,"Irvine, California"
858823610,50,Great Stay! Doris and Nathan are the best!,"The hotel was beautiful and the rooms were bigger than I had expected. I had the pleasure of renting out room 170. Once I stepped into the room, I felt that I was transported into days of past Hawaii. The room was decorated with small trinkets of hula dancers and pineapples. There were conversation pieces throughout the room. The room also had a KING bed which was nice but too big for my husband and I. We are used to sleeping in a QUEEN at home and only slept on one side of the bed. haha    Doris and Nathan are gems to your property. Truly embodied the meaning of Aloha",Sep 2022,September 2022,,,
858055988,50,Wonderful experience,"The Whaler on Kaanapali Beach is a beautiful facility In a perfect location. The room was excellent and perfect in every way.

857637477,10,August trip with my girls,I would not recommend this property. From the moment we walked up to the front desk to check in till the day we left and had to go get our own car from the parking lot even though we had valet park it. It was unwelcoming and the staff seem to be angry about their job. The pool area was crowded and security was rude to many of the people around the pool. The room was however very clean and nice.,Aug 2022,August 2022,,,
857618208,10,Aston Whaler Room W715,"I am writing this out of disappointment, the Whaler Room 715 we rented was terrible. When we got there the bathroom floor was so sandy you couldn’t walk on it barefoot. The overhead fan would not work. Some of electrical outlets would not work at the bar. The bathroom tub area was one of the nastiest I have ever seen. There is a gap in the ceiling tiles where the dust has accumulated and falls on you when you shower. Both of us got sick and I had to go to urgent care because of a severe sinus infection. As soon as we went to another island and room we felt better The room is outdated and in need of repair. Worse lodging of my life.",Aug 2022,July 2022,,,
857441051,50,Passing Expectations,We loved the hotel and its location - the best on Kaanapali Beach! Super relaxing and joyous stay! Our room and our view surpassed our expectations. The beach out front is wonderful and it's nice to see the beautiful catamaran boats beach very near by.,Aug 2022,August 2022,,,
856979732,20,no hot water in shower,we had no hot water in shower and the management failed to resolve the problem. it was clear that this was not a new issue and as such they shouldn't have assigned that room to us. no one from management ever reached out to help improve our stay,Aug 2022,August 2022,,,
854949751,20,Upside down mattress,"The carpet was old and filthy, the room was outdated, and the mattress was upside down!! Box springs facing up! Maintenance and housekeeping had to come flip it and remake the bed. Way over priced! We will never stay there again.",Aug 2022,August 2022,,,"Medford, Oregon"
854754345,50,right next to whalers village,loved the location. loved the price. loved the room. loved the view. loved the parking. I usually complain a lot and my daughter couldn't believe how happy I was with everything Very close to Lahaina and much better in my opinion than staying in South Maui,Aug 2022,August 2022,,,
854726551,50,Whaler Happiness,"All was beautiful! Our experience at the Whaler has always been wonderful, but this visit was even more fabulous because of the 12 floor view in room 1202. Also the updated decor was a welcome sight. We can't wait to return to the Whaler. The on beach service was perfect and so was the concierge was delightful.",Aug 2022,August 2022,,,
854485166,50,The Whaler at Kaanapali Beach,"This place is great! The staff were friendly and helpful. The facilities are beautiful.

Loved our stay!",Aug 2022,August 2022,,,
854358942,50,A perfect stay!!,"We just got back last night from Maui and stayed at The Whaler in Kaanapali via VRBO, unit 508. It was a perfect stay! The property is so beautiful. It's right on the beach with a terrific walking path to shops, restaurants, and other resorts. The pool is wonderful too, and I never had trouble getting a lounge chair. We would definitely stay there again. You can't beat the location!",Aug 2022,August 2022,,We were in room 508 which had a terrific beach/ocean view.,"Phoenix, Arizona"
853892627,50,Heaven on Earth,"The Whaler's location right on the beach with the swimming pool at the closest point to the beach plus the awesome gigantic garden between Tower 1 and Tower 2 makes for a heavenly view of all of this from our room in Tower 2 (looking directly at Molokai). Morning, noon, and nighttime, the ambiance is like no other place on earth. We have been coming to Maui for over 30 years. The Whaler is the best!",Aug 2022,August 2022,,,"Indian Wells, California"
851564688,50,Location and views!,"My hubby, 15 year old son and I are thoroughly enjoying our stay here. We have a standard view one bedroom suite. Clean and comfy room, fully stocked kitchen and two bathrooms! We can see the ocean and mountains from the large balcony. Booked here as part of a Costco package and the entire visit between flight, car and resort has been smooth.",Aug 2022,August 2022,Traveled with family,,"Jacksonville, Florida"
850856139,30,Accommodation,"We have stayed once before, which was a better experience for us, mainly due to the fact it was not holiday season. We were unable to get into the few restaurants available around the complex as no bookings were accepted and had to wait long periods. The complex itself is a great location with friendly staff who were most accommodating. Rooms are a good size, however, expensive.",Jul 2022,July 2022,,,
850091392,50,Good review,Beds need to be better very hard. Need more service people in the pool and equipment area. TV in master bedroom never worked  Everyone was very friendly and helpful. We will recommend the Whaler to all,Jul 2022,July 2022,,,"Central Point, Oregon"
849695126,50,The Whaler,"We stay exclusively at the Whaler every time we are lucky enough to go to Maui. The 1st time was about 30 years ago on our folk's recommendation. We got an oceanfront unit for 4 of us. It was so perfect, it is the only place we stay. During whale season you can watch them right from your lanai. This is true ocean front property. Entertainment, shopping and great food right next door at Whalers Village. A short beach walk to Black Rock where you can snorkel with turtles. We love the convenience of the full kitchen and outdoor grills. Location, Location, Location! The Whaler has it all. Top notch staff and service. It will not disappoint!",Jul 2022,July 2022,,,
848141754,30,Where’s the Ocean view ??,"I bought a “premium ocean view room”, and got a room that was the furthest room away from the ocean, with little to no ocean view from the unit (decent ocean view from the patio—but again, the absolute farthest room from the ocean that the property has to offer). I was told that the word “premium” in “premium ocean view” referred to the unit’s nicer couches and chairs, etc.. Not sure if i’m buying that lol.",Jul 2022,July 2022,,,"Santa Barbara, California, United States"
847408774,40,Amazing Condo Resort,"We rented Condo 508. This condo is almost perfect. The layout is great. The finishes are top notch. Our family had two other condos in the building and ours was easily the nicest. The washer and dryer were great and the amenities in the closet, beach chairs, noodles, boogie boards, etc were awesome and were well utilized.    The condition and location of the Whaler on Kaanapali beach is superb. Countless restaurants, shopping (Whaler’s Village next door), and activity vendors make it so you never have to leave. The ABC store next door at Whalers Village can cover many basic necessities.    Check-in was easy at the Whaler front desk. Parking underground was nice and convenient to the elevators. The trash shoot on each floor makes waste a breeze.    So why 4 stars? The mattress. The mattress on the King size bed was the worst mattress I have ever encountered. I travel 150 nights a year and this one was the worst I have been forced to sleep on. Its beyond rock-hard. After seeing the finishes and the money the owners spent renovating this place the last few years we were shocked they skimped so hard on a mattress. The mattress on the Murphy bed was great comparatively. If you have trouble sleeping on a rock-hard bed you might want to rethink this condo unless the owners update this feature. I like firm mattresses, this was not firm.    Everything else was awesome. If they get a new mattress, we’ll gladly return to 508. If not we’ll find another condo where we aren’t taking pain killers when we wake up.",Jul 2022,June 2022,,Walk to MonkeyPod!!,"Newcastle, Oklahoma"
846734380,50,Perfect location with teenagers,"We are staying here for 5 nights. I am with my twin 16 year olds and myself. Perfect location adjacent to Whalers Village, Black Rock Beach, Westin and other Kaanapali resorts. Approx 1000 sq. Foot villa. Kitchen, dining, Livng room, I separate bedroom. Beautiful ocean view with Lanai facing the beach. Concierge was helpful getting transportation for an early Lahaina excursion. Water refill in lobby for your hydro flask. In room coffee maker and full size fridge and fully supplied kitchen.",Jul 2022,July 2022,,,
845220085,50,Just landed and can’t wait to go back,"One of the best sunset views from a hotel i’ve ever experienced. The rooms have everything you need and more, the kitchenette being a gift. First trip to maui for me and honestly i couldn’t of picked a better hotel. the rate, the hospitality, the sense of comfort and the overall feel of calm hanging around is incredible. They do have quiet hours which is appreciated and will do almost anything if requested. I’d recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the island, and honestly i can’t wait to go back. Pure rest and relaxation. 10/10.",Jun 2022,June 2022,,,

845009978,50,Tropical Oasis,Great ocean views with top notch service. Cool coy pond in the center of the towers. Easy beach access with friendly staff ready to give you towels. They always had free refreshments by the pool to have. Finally the free beach chairs were an awesome addition.,Jun 2022,June 2022,,,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"
844946489,50,Excellent property to stay for a family of 6 adults.,Oceanfront is definitely the way to go. Great property with wrap around balcony with views of Black Rock and mountains behind. Everything is closeby and the beach is the best. The beds could have been better but the amenities more than made up for it.,Jun 2022,June 2022,,,"Los Angeles, California"
844635623,10,Absolute worst! Front desk Staff sucks.,"Worst experience..quality degraded..absolute worst behaviour by front desk..they don't make you feel comfortable or welcome..will stay at other condos..    They saw us tired and waiting at the reception for 5 hours..my husband and kids were feeling sick..yet they didnot take any step to expedite the checkin . We felt unwelcome by the front desk. The behaviour was hurtful ,I saw them gossiping and yet no efforts to atleast make an effort to expedite the checkin..seems like they liked to see the tired tourists in such condition..WE SAW THEM PROVIDE EARLY CHECK IN TO OTHER PEOPLE INFRONT OF US..",Jun 2022,June 2022,Traveled with family,,
843143972,50,Wonderful Stay!!!,"My family of 4 stayed in on of the beach facing 2 bedrooms. Everything about the experience was wonderful. Condo was huge and beautiful. Very clean and daily housekeeping!!!! We didn’t need daily cleanings, but fresh towels, coffee, detergent, etc was easily available from the friendly housekeeping staff. Plenty of green space, pond, nature on property. The pool was 5-6ft deep. Lots of chairs and umbrellas. Big steps for small kids to play. Our 5 year old granddaughter loved it. Oh, there’s also the most perfect beach and sunsets I’ve seen. Shopper village next door, with everything else needed for a great vacation.",Jun 2022,June 2022,,,"Austin, Texas"
842992594,50,"Good price, great location","Good price for a condo next door the Whaler Village. Could see ocean from balcony and a little from condo. Our room faced the back of a restaurant with constant mechanical noise, but we could still focus on the sounds of the waves. When we booked oceanfront, we expected to face the ocean, but it was still so beautiful. And it’s in the most convenient location to everything. So, I do recommend it for the price. Our room was a 1 bedroom and we hoped for a bedroom door for some privacy, but it was 2 bifold closet type doors. I’m not sure if all the units have these doors, but you might want to ask if you’re traveling with kids and anticipate the option for alone time.",Jun 2022,June 2022,,,"Saint Augustine Beach, Florida"
842874836,50,Excellent Staff and Facilities,The staff was very helpful and friendly. Our room exceeded our expectations and the staff worked with us to make sure our extended stay was perfect. The facilities are quite nice and well maintained. The bonus is being right next the Whaler Village for a little shopping.,Jun 2022,May 2022,,,"Auburn, Washington"
842465451,30,Anniversary,Hotel has a great location to beach and eateries. Lots of parking and the studio room was very big and ac worked very well.

842411785,50,Love this spot! Worth every penny,"We stayed for 5 nights in a 1 bedroom 2 bath condo on the 11th floor (1170). They are all privately owned so decorated differently but ours was amazing!! Our family of 5 (17,19,21 kids) had plenty of room (our kids like each other and slept one on the twin Murphy bed, one on the long section of the couch and one on the pullout section of the couch) and there was good storage in the extra bath plus a closet in the kitchen. The grounds were meticulously kept, the koi pond was fun to watch and beautiful, the pool area was busy but never too crowded, and the location along the kaanapali beachfront is perfect! Our condo had everything we needed. We even grilled at one of the condos grills one night. We LOVED THIS PLACE AND WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK!",Jun 2022,June 2022,Traveled with family,,"Orlando, Florida"
841792222,50,Fantastic experience,"We stayed in the Whaler for 4 nights and absolutely loved the experience.    We were slightly apprehensive when seeing pictures of the rooms with what I would describe as dated furniture, but do not let this put you off - everything was fantastic and would definitely visit again!    Pros:  - staff friendliness  - cleanliness of room  - well kept pool and grounds  - internet speed  - location to beach  - location for restaurants/ shopping    Cons:  - None",Jun 2022,May 2022,,,"Derry, United Kingdom"

840280801,50,Wonderful Experience,Right next to whalers village . Short walk to Black Rock and the wonderful snorkeling. A huge variety of fish and quite a few turtles . Staff was great.

840072716,40,Vacation time,"This ocean front property is beautiful and our unit was fantastic! Great views of the ocean and of the golf course. Plenty of seating on the lanai. LOTS of space in the two bedroom/two bathroom unit. Very clean! Also it was great to have a full sized kitchen. With a party of five, the cost was worth the amount.",May 2022,May 2022,,,
837523523,50,Another Great Trip at The Whaler on Kaanapali Beach,"We have stayed at the Whaler many times over the last 30 years and keep coming back because we love it! The rooms are spacious, well decorated, and comfortable. The kitchen is great with everything we need. Having an ocean view is fantastic! We rarely eat at restaurants because we love having a quick meal on the lanai and enjoying the ocean view. The property looks great and the staff are terrific. We plan to keep coming back when we visit Maui.",May 2022,April 2022,,,"Oregon, United States"
836068634,50,Our Favorite Place to Stay on Maui,"This is the second year in a row that we stayed here, it it our favorite. This trip we had the kids with us, they loved it. The location is amazing, it’s close to everything you need, lots of choices for dining, or prepare your own meals in the room with a full kitchen and cookware.  The rooms are very spacious, I think over 1000sf and up.  We especially like that it is right on the beach, a couple hundred steps from your room to the ocean.  Black Rock is a short walk up the beach, almost always see turtles there.  The entire Staff is amazing, they go out of their way to help you in any way they can. I want to give a special “Thank You “ to the person that does the room assignments, I didn’t get to thank them personally, but they do the best they can to fulfill all of your requests.  The grounds are always in pristine condition.  We highly recommend this resort.  Greg & Bella. Fontana, CA",Apr 2022,April 2022,Traveled with family,,"Fontana, California"
835631822,50,Fun,We were there with family for our 30th wedding anniversary. Enjoyed every minute. All the staff was wonderful. Our veiw was the best. Highly recommend end units with corner lanai and front ocean veiw. There is no better that we could find at kaanapali! Thank you.,Apr 2022,April 2022,,,"Sedro Woolley, Washington"
835565964,40,Needs update the units.,"Very good location. Units need to be updated. Curtains are old, dirty and broken. I was charged 25$ daily extra and I was not aware of that. Sliding door fall and when it was reported the front desk guy not even asked if we were ok.",Apr 2022,April 2022,,,"San Diego, California"
835348715,50,Excellent property,"Location is perfect, right on the beach and between Westin and Sheraton. Next to shopping mall and restaurants.

834973206,50,Best spot on Maui,"My wife and I visit Maui every year and always make a point to stay at the Aston at the Whaler. We try to book a unit with a view of Black Rock, and watch the cliff jumpers before we make the short walk there to snorkel and cliff jump ourselves. Kaanapali Beach is not for lovers of solitude, but the stream of happy vacationers adds to the mood. The location on the west Maui shore is convenient for trips into Lahaina or the beaches and landmarks driving north (but beware the road past the Olivine Pools), and it's always great to come back to the cool, clean, welcoming Aston.    A couple of cons: Popularity of the area makes it hard to get reservations at many restaurants; prices for the hotel rooms have soared.",Apr 2022,April 2022,,,"San Rafael, California"
834687111,50,The Whaler,"Loved everything but the unwelcoming receptionists. First time to be told, ""here are your leis, you can leis each other"". Closed to everything, beach, restaurants, shopping and black rock beach. But definitely will be back.",Apr 2022,April 2022,,,"Federal Way, Washington"

834339279,50,Vacation at the Whaler,Spring break  We try to walk to everything. Location meets that need.  I swam from black rock to the Whaler. My daughter swam a round trip!    The reef at black rock was better snorkeling than the catamaran  The reefs near the Whaler are enjoyable    The catamaran trip to Lanai treated us to dolphins and whales    HuiHui was great,Apr 2022,April 2022,,,"San Ramon, California"
833980161,50,Great Resort by the Beach,"Right on Kaanapali beach, great restaurants near by, great pool and spa, fully equipped kitchen in our condo. Comfortable codo, with a beautiful ocean view.

832783497,50,Loved this resort,"Since each unit seems to be a bit different, some are more upgraded than others. Ours needed a bit more upgrading. I liked the location, but would have preferred to be on a higher floor, not so close to the restaurant below.",Mar 2022,March 2022,,,"Huntington Beach, United States"
832575552,50,Beautiful Views!,This property was stunning. We stayed in room 911 and the view and the room were gorgeous. The front desk was quick to accommodate any request we had.

832373333,50,Amazing stay at The Whaler,We have been to Maui many times but this was our first stay at The Whaler. It was truly amazing!!! The location. The view. The rooms! It will be our place to stay now! We can not wait to book again. Thank you!,Mar 2022,March 2022,,,
831976446,50,Excellent Place to stay on Kaanapali Beach,"The Whaler has so much to offer! The location is excellent as guests have quick access to Whaler Village's outstanding restaurants and shops. Even though the location is next to a busy shopping/eating area, it is extremely quiet and safe.  It is only a few steps to the beach and the pool has many chairs for soaking up the sun.

831715216,10,Don’t waste your money.,"In all my years of staying at hotels, only one experience was worse than this one. I realize Aston rents out condos that belong to others, but there has to be some accountability for poor quality rooms and exorbitant prices. When we walked in the room, I thought I was transported back 40 years. The furniture and decorations were old and worn out; after taking a shower, the pipes knocked for 15 minutes; we had to cover the air conditioning vent with a towel, because the cold air was directed towards the bed. In short, the room was depressing—definitely not what one would expect for $700/night. We worked with hotels.com and the Aston staff to cancel the remaining two days of the rental. We then bought tickets back to HNL, and stayed at a 5 star hotel for less than the cost of the condo. I appreciate the consideration given by the Aston GM, and staff. However, we will not be returning.",Mar 2022,March 2022,,,

830161659,50,We love the Whaler on Kaanapali Beach,"WoW we said on our first day - and everyday we were there. This is a FANTASTIC PROPERTY w Our condo was nicely furnished and fully equipped which is why we chose a condo and not a hotel room.  We liked the fact that it was right next door to Whalers Village and close to many great restaurants. We walked the oceanfront beach path every morning.

Its right next to Whalers Village and so location, location, location is nice. Very convenient to walk over to the village for breakfast, shopping, coffee, meals. Theres a gate at the entrance where you have to push the button to be allowed in(the first time through). Im guessing this is so people going to Whalers dont all park in the Aston parking lot. Check in was easy.    Had a nice ocean view from the room. The room is nice with a full kitchen and table and couch. Its a little bit older looking than the Westin rooms. Not as modern. The bathroom could have been a little cleaner. The shower lets a lot of water come out since there's no door but just a glass panel.    Parking is packed underground and so more often than not, we had to park in the outside parking lot.    We didnt use the pool but were on the beach mostly. The pool is decent but not as big as other resorts.    Overall, the location is convenient. People were nice. If you're looking for a bigger resort feel, you probably want to stay at Westin, Marriott or Hyatt. if you want a smaller feel, with good location, then Aston is good.",Jan 2022,January 2022,,,"Sunnyvale, California"

816915726,20,Pool issues - people reserve seats then leave for hours,"This place has a great location and views, however, if you like to hang out by the pool there are some serious issues. Every day, people line up at 8AM with towels/book/hats, and most leave their stuff on chairs for to improperly “reserve” them, then LEAVE for HOURS! It is not uncommon to arrive at the pool at any time of day and there are no desirable chairs near the pool, as they are all “reserved” despite there being very few people actually there. Management claims they “encourage” guests not to leave their stuff unattended for more than an hour, but this policy clearly does not work. People regularly leave for 2-3 hours with no consequence and no way to track who comes/goes. Why should people even be allowed to leave their stuff unattended for an hour? How about 15 min max! (Write their name/arrival time on a card placed on the chair to track this nonsense). You come to the pool or don’t come to the pool. This is ridiculous and happens daily, and is extremely frustrating enough to make me find another nearby hotel that deals with this issue. Many other hotels have addressed this common problem and posted signs saying that unattended/abandoned items will be moved to clear chairs for people that are actually at the pool area. Or perhaps, they should just charge a nominal per hour fee for all chairs, since people are severely abusing this first-come-first-serve policy. I really hope they address/fix this issue ASAP or my family will be staying somewhere else this fall!",Oct 2021,October 2021,,,

810289982,50,Aloha Vibes 🌈,"We have been coming to Aston at the Whaler for the past five years and it has always been a wonderful experience “coming home” as a couple and as a family. The aloha that you feel the moment you arrive stays with you throughout your entire stay. The warm and amazing staff of Marissa, Amy, and Rod have always made sure of this and are now like family to us.    The property has a very nice balance of retro architecture with contemporary renovations - There are two 70’s vibe buildings with a gorgeous tropical grounds between them. With it’s rock waterfall spilling into its gorgeous koi pond and arching wooden bridge, completely surrounded by neatly manicured grass, it never fails to take our breath away.    The location is perfect for us. We much prefer the more relaxed and casual feel of Kaanapali (as opposed to Wailea). With Whalers Village just next door, it’s a one minute walk to restaurants, shopping, and live music. The beach is a long stretch of sprawling golden sand with a hint of red to it that leads into the clear warm waters of the South Pacific. A five minute walk up the beach provides the opportunity to swim with some of Hawaii’s most vibrantly colored fish and beautiful sea turtles (just remember to resist the temptation to touch them!)    The units are individually owned and can vary on both size / upgrades so we recommend doing your research or speaking with someone on staff before booking. While hitting our favorite dining spots is always enjoyable, we love the ability to prepare our meals in the unit’s full kitchen. 1 bedroom Ocean View is definitely a winner!

807376597,50,"Well Maintained Property, Great Location","We're just back from a family vacation for which we rented two 2-BR/2-BA condos at The Whaler. The 2-BR units are on the corners of the building, each with a wrap around lanai that offers stunning 270 degree views of both the ocean and the mountains. We ate our home-cooked meals most evenings on the lanai except for one time when it was too windy. Our 2 units were nicely decorated with well-furnished kitchens. There is an individually controlled A/C in each BR and in the main room as well. The check-in process was inefficient, with apparently no one allowed in before 3:00 pm regardless of whether the unit is ready, and the parking garage is difficult to maneuver, so we just parked our big SUV in the outdoor lot next to the tennis courts. Proximity to the beach, ABC Store, Whaler's Village shops and restaurants, and the beach walk was excellent. There were a couple of days when we never even drove the car. The pool is small and crowded and not very kid-friendly since it is entirely 5-6 feet deep except for the steps. 8:30 am koi fish feeding at the pond offered a fun diversion for the kids. Fresh pool towels are available whenever the pool is open and you can use them on the beach as well. Chairs can be borrowed and taken out on the beach. The entire staff and most of the guests wore masks so we felt safe. We'll definitely be staying here again. I checked out amenities and prices at nearby resorts, but having our own kitchen makes The Whaler the best choice for us.",Aug 2021,August 2021,,Tower 2 (not adjacent) to Whaler's Village is quieter and offers better mountain views,"Redwood City, California"

It was so spacious - the bedrooms were big, tons of seating for lounging and dining both inside and on the balcony. Our views were gorgeous. The condo was clean, updated, comfortable. The location of the Whaler cannot be beat. Right on the best beach, tons of space to set up for the day, no issue getting chairs to use from the resort. The pool is basic but really nice - there is no shallow end though, so beware if you have kids. The shallowest part was 5ft. The pool temp was perfect. There are two bbq areas, nicely maintained with lots of spots to sit and take in the views. The Whaler is big and nice enough to feel high end but not an overwhelming huge resort with a maze of pools and restaurants and buildings. The amenities are high end but basic. I was comfortable letting my kids roam a little and go to and from the condo by themselves without fearing they'd get lost. Way less crowded than nearby Westin, Marriott Ocean Club, Hyatt, etc. There are no lights on the balcony so if you're eating dinner or hanging out after dark, the balcony/lanai is dark and makes it difficult to see (ie see your food, see your board game, etc.). The master bed in our particular condo was also horrendous. Old, squeaky, worn out, way too soft. Taking a breath or moving your arm was enough to make it squeak loudly. I would give this 5 stars if not for the master bed being so bad.

Most owners are mean, old people reserving their seats starting at 8AM at the swimming pool, and screaming at other guests for anything, especially with the ones with young children. They stay there for at least 2-3 months per year and act like they really own the entire place.  Kudos for the staff.. the only great thing at this place.

799132274,30,Not What We Booked,"We were so excited for this trip as it was our first big vacation in 2 years as for many. We had heard such great things about it from family and had researched best places for family and was convinced this was it. Was very disappointed when we checked in after a long day of traveling to find out they did not have our room for us that we had reserved and already paid for. We reserved a one bedroom/2 bath ocean view suite and they basically said “whoops”, we don’t have one. Then they tried to assure me they were giving me a “premium” one bedroom/ 1 bath ocean view. There was nothing “premium” about the room we were in. It was just your average room with an okay ocean view, but we had reserved and paid for that already. Worse, the room was not ready and we had to wait 30 minutes past check-in time in a hot hallway as we just wanted to get in our room, use our one bathroom to wash up and unpack and relax. We were told we would get a credit for the mistake and inconvenience but we have yet to see anything. We have only been home a few days but that seems like something that could have been done right away, so we shall see. We asked for the possibility of a late checkout on our last day and reminded them of the inconveniences we had dealt with already and they gave us one hour. While the location is a nice one and convenient to shopping and restaurants at Whaler’s next door (if you could get in to the restaurants) and to Black Rock, I am not sure we would stay here again. The lanai was nice and we sat there many hours, but would have loved to have done so from the lanai of our reserved room. The only reason we chose this location was for the fact we could get 2 bathrooms and we didn’t get that. I am thrilled for those who have had great experience here.

We did zip lines, ATV’s, helicopter ride, para sailing, and a sunset cruise on a catamaran that picks you up right there at the beach. Terry and his concierge arranged all of it. The view of the beach, especially the sunsets were beautiful. Service from greeting and assistance at arrival to care of the room were the best.  On a final note, my wife and I renewed our wedding vows the last day. Terry arranged everything.

788126573,50,Loved it! Small bed,"We loved our stay here. The room and kitchen were small in a studio but the bathroom was nice, walk in closet and lanai were lovely. It did have a couch and a dining table and desk. It was more than enough and we were babymooning so it was nice to be cozy. We had the top floor ocean view and it was just EPIC. The underground parking is limited at night but when we could get a spot, it was so convenient to just ride the elevator to the car and not have to walk. The property is also reasonably sized so the beach was a 3 minute walk from our room. It was much more like staying in someone’s apartment than a hotel. My only real complaint about the room was the queen sized Murphy bed. Squeaky and too small. One of us slept on the couch all three nights. Would definitely stay again but see if we could request a larger bed.",May 2021,May 2021,Traveled as a couple,,
786975705,50,Greg & Bella’s Awesome Review of the Whaler.,"My GF and I stayed at this resort from 4/10/21 to 4/17/21. This resort is condominiums. We had a “ Premium Ocean View Suite” this room was fully equipped, complete kitchen, all utensils, pots, pans, cookware...etc. we had 1 bedroom 2 bathrooms, one had an awesome shower.  The view from the lani was great.  Parking is underground if available, we lucked out and were able to find a spot every time we came back from town. There is also an outdoor overflow parking area.  This resort is right next to Whalers Village, it has its own private pass through gate if you need to make a quick trip to an ABC store.  They have several different room types, prices vary.  We booked the entire stay through Costco Travel, we ended up with a much lower price than booking Flight, Hotel and Car rental on our own.  The Staff is friendly and they go out of their way to help if you have any issues or questions.  We will definitely be back.  Greg & Bella.

Unfortunately they could not accommodate us for the entire stay in one room and we had to move mid vacation. Room 952 was amazing! Ocean front and spectacular views from the wrap-around balcony. Room was well appointed and updated. We had to move mid trip to 1052. While the balcony and room views were amazing, the room itself needed some repair and updating. Coffee maker was broke and the TV stopped working among other small issues (well the final 4 was one so that might be a big issue). The staff was very quick to respond and fixed as necessary. The move itself was less than desirable as it left us without our things and no place to go for about 5 hours. A bit of an inconvenience for sure. If they knew the change had to be made, planning a direct move would have eased the disruption to our vacation.

Our room was clean and updated. We had a studio ocean view condo. We really enjoyed having breakfast and coffee on our balcony each day overlooking the ocean. One great feature about the property is that it is not too large and very manageable to navigate. You can get from your room to the beach in under 5 minutes. Some of the other resorts in Maui are so large and confusing to navigate. Additionally, the resort is located on one of the best parts of Kaanapali Beach.

785374427,10,"NOT a 5 star, 2 stars at best. Ant infested","The WORST type of accommodation you can choose to stay at while in Maui. The entire unit was INFESTED with ants from the kitchen to the bed area. We informed management multiple times, Terry Dowsett the manager 100% lied to us our face and said she had another room she would be placing us in, and that it would be ready when we arrived back from our day trip to Hana. Once we returned, the evening front desk manager claimed they could not give us another room and that they “sprayed the room for insects and changed the sheets” and gave us a 136 dollar credit (a joke). We went up to the room to see it and the sheets were not changed at all still ants crawling on the pillows, bedding, and nightstand. On top of all this the towels were completely ragged and stained as if they are multiple years old and worn, nothing you would imagine from a 5 star resort. We requested new ones and the same issue was apparent with those as well. For the sake of our vacation I reserved a hotel at this point at the Westin which is right next door, our experience instantly changed. For $300-400 a night you would at minimum expect a clean, insect free space with decent towels and quality amenities space. The owners of these units are a joke and the management is even worse. This is not a 5 star resort, please don’t ruin your vacation like they have ours. Also be sure to pay attention to how you’re treated when issues arise, I realize I should have left this abhorrent place day 1 with the poor customer service we received. See the photos I am 100% writing this review truthfully and honestly. I know their rebuttle to this review will be a typical robotic customer service message.

784096389,10,Awesome location but very old rooms,"We booked and ocean view room but at first we were given a room overlooking construction. After we complained they changed our room the the one facing pool and the ocean and the view was amazing. However dishwasher stunk so bad that we immediately had to start a cycle just to get rid of the smell. We didn't ask to switch rooms again because we were too tired at that point. Next morning we found out that half of the appliances like coffee maker and toaster weren't working, we contemplated checking out early but decided it wasn't worth wasting time. On top of it all they have some pluming issues where water only runs hot for a while and doesn't get cold. Normally it wouldn't be an issue but after all day in the sun... They got us a new coffee maker eventually and when we mentioned that the rooms are very old they said that we should have booked the premium room. It would have been a good stay if it wasn't for appliances and pluming.",Mar 2021,February 2021,,book premium room or through private owner as some of the apartments are very nice,"Indianapolis, Indiana"
783967500,40,Location is amazing!,"Not all beaches in Ka'anapali are this perfect and maybe none are. The ocean here is great for swimming, snorkeling, boogie boarding, SUP, just getting your feet wet... what ever you want to do. My son and I are timid swimmers and felt very comfortable in these incredibly clear waters. And when the surf was too strong for us we simply walked up to the cove area at Black Rock where the water is always calm. And there are surf lessons a short walk to the south.    If getting in the ocean is not your thing, the pool is also great (warmer than others) but I suspect it gets crowded during normal busy times.    Being right next door to Whaler's Village is also a huge plus. Stay lots of other places in Ka'anapali and you'll have to drive there. Being able to drop in at the Village on a whim for gelato, pizza, sundries at the ABC store, etc, is great. Also, this is where the big catamarans pick up for whale watching, snorkeling, and sunset dinner sails (Trilogy, Teralani, etc).    Now about the rooms--we stayed in two different 1bd/2ba premium ocean view rooms during our trip which was planned for 7 days, but we loved it so much we stayed an extra 20 days (upside to distance learning!) Both rooms were very nice but one was distinctly better in terms of design and maintenance. We prefer north-facing rooms for the shade and view of Black Rock, but I believe south-facing are less windy. Rooms facing the courtyard are great and any floor above 2 or so gives a good view. Speaking of views--we saw so many whales from our lanai, more in early February vs early March, though.    The plus side to staying here through Aston is that they control many of the units (almost half, I think) so they can move you to a different unit if necessary. The minus side is that Aston's rates are a likely higher than if booking directly with an owner. I would pay a small premium for the ability to move if necessary.",Mar 2021,February 2021,,,"Austin, Texas"

The scenery between the 2 towers of the mountain was breathtaking. The staff was friendly.    My only 2 complaints were 1) I called to ask about beach chairs and the information provided was not helpful. I was told first come first serve (which was true), but they made it sound as if there were not a lot of chairs. Not one of the 7 days we were there were the beach chairs fully occupied. We did not need to purchase the chairs we did. Better information/communication on that would have been nice. 2) our safe locked up (batteries died) with all of our valuables in it. We were not leaving so it was not urgent, but we didn’t have a maintenance person out for almost 12 hours. Perhaps there was someone on call if it was urgent, but it was a bit concerning that if we were on our way out, that no one was available to help.    Neither of these things would stop us from staying there again.

The one exception to our otherwise perfect stay was the dated bathrooms in the suite. The sink faucet was loose, the wood trim and marble counters were damaged/cracked, and the toilet would keep running after flushing if we didn’t finesse the handle a specific way. 1st world problems, I know! :)  Still, love this resort.

The resort is world class, and as classy as it gets. The staff is full of aloha and quick to help. The amenities are in top shape, and include everything need. The location is second to none. And the rooms are breathtaking. For the nightly rate we were paying we expected a mid-tier quality room in a mediocre location (we're on a budget). But we felt like royalty staying in this beautifully renovated unit with incredible views. The layout of the Whaler is set to provide stunning views from almost every single condo. Oh and the Whaler also combines the best of both worlds, taking the term condotel to a whole new level. You get the convenience of having a full condo with kitchen, bedrooms, ours even had laundry machines; but you also get all of the service and treatment of staying in a high end hotel.

The view every morning and night was alone was worth it as we saw whales and beautiful sunsets. The condo itself was in the best location right in the middle of Kaanapali Beach with all amenities around it including restaurants and shopping. The condo was well stocked with all you would need and the chairs, coolers, flippers and boogie boards were very appreciated as we had a blast on the beach with the waves. Black rock was great for snorkelling and we saw many fish and turtles.  Like i said, without the pandemic getting in the way of our holiday it would of been perfect, but we spent time on the beach, BBQing food we got from Lahania Safeway which was a $2.00 , 5 minute bus ride, easy peasy.  Location location location they say and you cant get better than Mr Rudolphs condo, he was so pleasant to deal with even calling us to check up on us as i kept updating him on the closures and policies that were in place due to Covid-19 and he always answered the emails quickly.

The hotel manager Jason is amazing which is a good thing because he has to makeup for the rude and unprofessional staff whether it’s the front desk clerks, guest services, or the towel guy’s. The room was disgusting it was old, and smelly, the odor was so bad we had to sleep with the screen door open. The furniture is horrible I wouldn’t even sit on it without putting a towel down. The pull-out bed was nasty we weren’t even sure if the sheets were clean. It was like sleeping on a concrete! If you have 3 adults staying in this room keep this in mind. If pyou need to get up in the middle of the night you will need to crawl over one another to get to the bathroom because there isn’t any room to walk between the beds!!! I could go on and on about how repulsive the room was. Housekeeping didn’t even supply toilet paper or Kleenex we had to call 3 different time in our 14 days there to get supplies. 3 times our room never got cleaned. The bathroom was never cleaned in 14 days true story! The sheets were changed 3 times if that! The pictures on the internet show nice updated rooms that’s not what you get the rooms are old AF!!!

751311326,20,"Great Location, but...","Pros: Great location. right on the beach. close to shopping, food. beautiful grounds, good housekeeping staff.  Cons: Snooty reception staff, requests not fulfilled , condition of your unit depends on the owner.    Strike one: requested upper floor unit when I made the reservation. Received email from resort stating that our request can be honored. We were assigned a fourth floor unit (out of 12 floors). When we brought this up to the receptionist at check in the response was, ""that is what we assigned you"". Basically, go away.    Strike two: We arrived around noon, knowing this was early. we then asked if an early check in was possible. the response was that ""check in time is a four"", but we will try to expedite your room. We will call you. Cool. So, we stuck around, had lunch went shopping, etc. no call. Came back around 2:30. room ready? ""check in time is a four"" (they should all be wearing t-shirts that say check in time is at four, because this is their mantra). Once again, they say we can try to expedite your room. Really? Its a little more than an hour from four clock now.  we then went for a walk on the beach. 3:30, 4:00, no call. finally we came back around 4:10. Your room is ready! Of course luggage was not there yet. If we had known it would be four hours to get our room ready, we would have drove around, or went someplace. Receptionists really don't care.  Funny thing is, that for the week we were there, our room was always cleaned by lunch time, as well as adjacent rooms that had occupants checked out, were also ready by noon. Again, reception does not care. Mimi will give you an attitude, especially if it is at he end of her shift.  Our (fourth floor) room was dingy at best. Lanai furniture was rusty and old.

749967337,40,Whaler unit #714 traveler alert,"Good news and bad news on this particular unit - the good news: The Whaler is a lovely property that is well situated along Kaanapali Beach, near shopping and restaurants, close to snorkeling at Black Rock, the condo/timeshare/hotel set up offers a free washer/dryer on each floor. I am sure most of the units are very nice.    The bad news: Unit 714 is a dump! The best part is the patio with a partial ocean view and a pretty good bed. Otherwise, this owner has deferred maintenance for decades and the rental company that handles the property obviously does not inspect it. The entire place needs a deep clean and refurbishment. The carpet was buckled and stained, both bedside lamps had broken liners, the kitchen appliances were rusted, the drapes were musty and the black out liner was shredding, the wallpaper seams were pulling apart and curling, the drop ceiling above the shower was filled with decades of dust and debris right above where you are trying to get clean. The door to the patio was difficult to operate and after four days into our seven day stay one side froze in place altogether. Luckily it was in the closed position. I contacted the rental company after our first day. Maui Beachfront Rentals handles this property and sends many pages of rules and requirements for this rental but does not tell you it is in disrepair. When I asked about it after arrival, they said that it is constantly rented so it is hard to get in to do maintenance. They also said the owner was aware of the patio door issue but they couldn't get her to buy a new one yet. Part of the rental fee includes a significant cleaning for this size of space but it was not clean. Old food splatter covered the side of the frig next to the stove. So they wanted to send a cleaning company over while we were there but we would have to be out for several hours. I suggested they should take it out of service long enough to get these things done rather than disrupt our vacation. They did give us a small refund on our payment but I would never go back to this unit. There are many other units available in this building through other sources like VRBO, etc. so we will use another source when we go back. And we certainly will not stay in #714 again.

743756890,50,Some Helpful Hints,"This was our fourth trip to The Whaler. Obviously we think it’s a wonderful place or we wouldn’t have stayed there 4 times. So rather than give a full review, I’d rather just give a few helpful hints when staying there.    1. When booking a room, certainly check travel websites and especially the Aqua-Aston website. But then take a couple of extra minutes to call into the reservation line. When we did, told them the dates and prices we were seeing and asked if there was a better deal – and there was. Got a better room for a lesser price than we would have booked online. May not always work, but worth a few minutes of your time.    2. There is a concierge desk, so great place to start if you have questions. She was able to point us in the right direction for a couple of activities we wanted to do. She was also able to get my husband a great deal on renting golf clubs. She is a great resource.    3. If you’re thinking of renting one of the cabanas at the beach, think twice. They cost $75 for the day, but you can no longer have them close to the shore. You have to sit further back on the beach with less of a view. However, a nice alternative is just renting beach chairs and umbrella from them. We were able to get a package for $99 for 7 days. Plus we were able to take them to other beaches we wanted to visit.    4. If you are going to be at the beach – please, please, please be careful of the surf. The waves coming in can be very powerful and the back tow is nearly as strong. We’ve seen several people caught up and knocked over at the ocean’s edge. Even if you’re a good swimmer you want to be especially aware of the surf there.    5. Check out the Fairway shops. They are up the road directly opposite The Whaler’s entrance. There’s pizza, Asian food, CJ’s Deli (awesome), a general store and more. We find the options better and less expensive than at the Whaler Village.    6. If you’re planning a longer stay there’s laundry facilities on each floor near the elevators. There should be small boxes of detergent left in your room and the machines themselves are free to use. Just remember to pack a few dryer sheets and you’re all set. This might not be for everyone, but if you’re going to be there a while it could save you on baggage fees for the airlines. If you’re willing to do a couple of loads of wash, you won’t have to pack as much.    7. Lastly, if you are parking in the underground garage and have lots of stuff to carry to your room, check near the entry door for some small carts that are available to use. They work great if you have a bunch of luggage, groceries, beach stuff. etc. They’re just a nice little convenience.",Feb 2020,January 2020,,,Rochester NY

All lovely-however there are a few details I wish were attended to. I’ve included pics to share. 1) please update lanai furniture-it was outdated, cheap looking and dirty 2) carpet? Please tear out the outdated, stained carpet and put in wood or wood look flooring-would be an improvement. Laundry in units but also on each floor and FREE! Definitely a benefit!!

They found us a room that was much better situated for our needs, all while doing this with the utmost professionalism and Aloha. Our anniversary was saved.

738522170,50,Far exceeded my expectations,"Our family of 4 (my husband and my in laws) just completed a wonderful 6 night stay at the Whaler. We stayed in 2 premium studio units with ocean view on 4th and 6th floors booked via Aston. I was a little hesitant booking a condo over a resort property as I was unsure of the level of service and ambiance. However, my expectations were far exceeded starting at moment of arrival. We had a lovely greeting with a shell necklace - something that not all properties (even resorts) do. Both units were incredibly clean and I was surprised with the check in call from Aston the morning of our first whole day to make sure we didn’t have any issues. Even though our room was near the elevators on the 6th floor I found it incredibly quiet both day and night. The overall ambiance of the property was great, including the meticulously cared for grounds were impressive. Aston staff was consistently caring for the property and were always friendly and helpful. Given that we were there during Christmas season we didn’t use the pool as it was a little busy, but there was no need with the ocean directly in front. My in laws were in love with the location - they walked to Whaler’s Village daily (maybe 2x daily) and nothing beats a 2 minute walk to great restaurants such as Hula’s and Monkey Pod. Thank you to the Aston staff for making this a wonderful vacation right from the ease of booking and then throughout our stay. I know we will return again.

734971652,50,Excellent Location and Property,"We stayed at the Whaler for 11 days in December 2019. The property is wonderful. It has a beautiful beach in front of the two tower condo buildings that is big, much bigger than some of the hotels further south. The pool and hot tub are fabulous. Check in and check out were a breeze. We stayed in a unit on the 9th floor in tower 2 directly under the Hula Grill on the south facing side. It was very nice, but the smoke from the Hula Grill can be a throat irritant at times. Personally I think I would look to book the south side of Tower 1 if I stay here again. The south side of both buildings gets the sun with nice sunrises and sunsets. The north sides of tower 1 & 2 don’t get the sun. I think it’s important to understand that when booking. I did see some people walking the beach at times, but in my opinion the 1 mile stretch of beach is not really a walking beach because it’s not flat. Others might disagree. There is a wonderful sidewalk that fronts the beach all along that 1 mile which is great for walking however.

The staff at The Whaler treat you like family and are very accommodating to your requests. I would recommend paying a little extra for an ocean front room. We had a corner unit in Tower 1 which meant we had two really long patios. One that faced the ocean and the other had ocean and mountain views.    Walking distance to Whaler Village is really nice because it was a quick trip to the ABC store to buy all of the little things you forgot or just have to have. Also, there are some pretty amazing restaurants in there. Beach access was spectacular and our condo had beach chairs and an umbrella for us to use. The pool area is smaller than I expected so it was a little difficult to find a chair in there on some days.    The kitchen was top of the line and had everything we needed. We also made use of the grills down by the beach and learned they are cleaned every day. They were always spotless! Did I mention the 70"" flatscreen we had?! We are already discussing making plans to go back again next Thanksgiving!",Dec 2019,November 2019,,,
731425661,40,"First trip to Hawaii, good condo, best beach, should've listened to friend's advice tho...","Serendipitously, our friends have direct-owner-rentals in bldg 1 overlooking the court yard in between the two towers. We were too frazzled trying to figure it all out (lack of mental capacity due to crazy months of work) and went to a travel agent, which got us a slightly better price b/c of their purchasing discount, but we didn't have control over the room location.    Our friends suggested calling the Whaler's 1-800 number and requesting Bld 1 (b/c updated furnishings compared to 2) and overlooking courtyard, but we procrastinated and called too late. We landed in Bldg 2, not overlooking the courtyard (which would have been prettier), but west facing over the whaler village which was still incredibly nice. We were on the 8th floor and I'd recommend fl 8 or higher for ocean views! Bring a bit of tinfoil, saran wrap, maybe a lockable tupperware container for food, as these aren't provided, but virtually everything else is. Also bring good thermal water bottles that you can pack with ice from your room and add ice tea or water from the lobby to keep hydrated - it'll save you buying bottles of it over and over.    OUR ROOM: 865    BEST ADVICE - don't do bldg 1 east view, your ocean sights are impeded.    IN SEQUENCE, TRY - bldg 1 west side overlooking courtyard, then Bldg 2 east overlooking courtyard, then Bldg 2 west side overlooking whaler's village. In all, 8th floor or higher.    The studio apt. was well appointed, the bed awesome, they had dishwasher/sink/laundry soap provided. Balcony was lovely. Shower walk-in. Safe in large walk-in closet. The room was ideal for 2 adults, and I could see it being fine for an additional child too b/c seating is for 4 and room is large to accommodate.    Safeway is 10 minutes down the road - buy food and bring it back by catching the public transit next door at Whaler Village for $2 to Lahaina, which you must plan to visit. They have neat touristy shops (prices differ per - so compare), an outlet mall, and a really neat boardwalk area with great architecture, scenery, eateries overlooking the water, and the banyan tree is actually worth the visit.    We are planning to do a full day-trip to Hana (everyone advises start early - 7 ish - and plan a full day for a sunset there). Also, the Old Lahaina was the luau we wanted to go see, but plan ahead and book early. Instead, we could get into Drums of the Pacific which is bigger, less authentic, but fine for first-timers like us I'm sure. We did a lot of research on luau's and snorkeling excursions. To save money we considered just renting on the beach by Black Rock, but to ensure we make the most of our time, booked a morning trip with Magic Merman. It was cheaper to book Magic Merman for the snorkel through Expedia than their own website, btw, b/c no booking fees.    Look for ABC in Whaler's Village for snacks or convenience food stuff, even liquor. The first time we needed to forage for food, I could only find a seafood burger and fries for $25 and it was meh. The next day I found ABC and could have gotten snacks, fresh fruit, sandwiches and the sort there for pennies, comparatively.    I have issue with paying $25 for a boogie board that I can't fit in my luggage and would have to leave behind after a day or two of use, but what I found is that there's many who do, then just discard perfectly good ones on the beach come sun down, so we snagged two and enjoyed the day on them and will gift them to others when we leave. We also brought a decent beach mat with us and that worked great on the beach without needing to rent chairs. We also brought a small collapsible 6 can cooler that with ice, allows you to bring snacks or lunch with you to the beach or on the road to Hana, or to keep groceries cool when travelling to/from Ka'anapali.    For a first time visit, I would repeat every single minute. I've traveled over 20 countries and quite extensively through Canada and U.S. (by motorcycle predominately) and I hope to make this a routine visit for us every 2-3 years.",Dec 2019,December 2019,,"Bldg 1 or 2 of Whalers Village with court yard view, 8th floor or higher","Victoria, Canada"

It was directly on the beach, walking distance to lively restaurants, and many hotel options to get meals. Snorkeling at Blackrock was so cool, eels, turtles colorful fish. We went on a boat/snorkel trip to Lanai, Kayaking and snorkel, Road to Hana to see many wonderful waterfalls.    We loved our room, the pool, the beach, the black rock and walk distance to so many things. We had a great day golfing at The Royal Kaanapali and our youngest went to the kids club at the Aston Kaanapali Shores. She had a great experience.    Our son had his 11th birthday and the staff was so gracious and made him feel very special. We want to give a shout out to Nathan for his great informative conversations, fish food and singing Happy Birthday, Cheri for her kindness and support celebrating Jaxen's birthday, Nicki for her advice and photos of us, Princess for fun conversations, Michael for his towel and info, Ben for his insights on the island, Gasty for helping Jaxen have a fire by the beach at night and Dexter and Rod for their fun conversations with Jaxen.    We can't thank you enough for making us feel so comfortable. It was our Home Away From Home!    We want to plan a trip back next year to see the whales.

722238010,40,Great Location and an Enjoyable Stay,"I researched various accommodation options and found The Whaler to be one of the better priced. Accommodation is expensive and this was at our 'middle of the road' price point. Knowing what we could be paying at the high end, meant my expectations were managed. I knew the quality of our condo such as the fit out and amenities were really at the mercy of the owner. I'd read that the pool area was small and it wouldn't be like one of the bigger resorts with restaurants, swim up bars etc.    All that was true but turns out we didn't miss any of that. The grounds are well maintained. The pool area was busy but we always found two loungers. I noticed that staff would patrol and remove towels from unattended loungers so lounger hoggers were well managed. It was off season so not too many kids which is what we prefer not being parents.    Our condo was in Tower 1 with an ocean view which was beautiful. The decor was more practical than luxurious but the bed was comfy and we had lots of space. Air con was good. Laundry facilities were very welcome although there isn't really anywhere for a clothes line and you aren't allowed to put clothing out on the balcony to dry in the sunshine. We managed by hanging items in the walk in wardrobe and shower curtain rail.    I had done some online shopping prior to our visit and all items were there ready for me to collect. Staff were friendly although we didn't really need much help. Beautiful location right on the beach. Proximity to Whaler Village meant there were lots of food and drink options. We also drove to Times Supermarket so dined in a few times. We didn't cook as such but had salads and 'pre prepped' food from the supermarket.    I'd recommend staying here.

Accessing the Kaananapali beach was as simple as taking the elevator downstairs, crossing the lawn in between the 2 towers in the property, and stepping onto the beach sand. The shops at the nearby Whaler Village is 5 mins away on foot, which came in handy when we realized at 9:00 PM that we had run out of milk for breakfast next day.  There is no restaurant on the property and the pool is just fair compared to the fancy ones in nearby hotels.  In our original booking thru the Costco vacation package, we found our allotted room in Tower one (facing north) not to our liking because the HVAC noise from the roof of a neighboring property to the north was just too loud to enjoy sitting in the balcony. Because the view and experience in the balcony was important to use we ended up upgrading to another room Tower 2 (south) with the balcony facing the grass lawns in between the towers, having a pretty good view of the ocean on the west and with Black Rock further north in sight.

Every floor has FREE laundry which was amazing. The gym was big and they had wipes for machines and towels.    The pool was being renovated so we could either go to beach (no charge to take a chair or two on the beach) or use the pool at the Kaanapali.    This place is geared towards the older adult. The age was about 60ish up. The pool was mostly an older crowd (Im assuming they were Kaanapali and Whaler patrons mixed in). The plus was there was only one or two screaming kids. The minus is that a younger person might find it TOO quiet here. We loved it. We are in our late forties and welcomed the more mature crowd. I could read a book in peace.    We loved being so close to the Kaanapali (the most Hawaiian hotel) and enjoyed their free music and hula. And...so close to black rock and Whalers Village to eat and mill around.

I completed an incident report and provided pictures. I didn’t ask for anything. They told me to let them know if I needed anything, to contact them. I had to go to physical therapy because of scar tissue and bruising. I called, texted and emailed and asked if they would pay my co-pay. It was $15.00. Money was not the issue. I thought it was their responsibility. I am so disappointed that they ignored my request. As of today, I am still working on the scar tissue.  Like I said, great hotel, great spot.

But this was completely ignored by other guests, some of whom came down early to grab the shaded slots, and then left the chairs unoccupied for hours.

Unfortunately, things at home have gone downhill.    Our recent stay was in unit 518. There are some maintenance issues that need to be addressed. I am not talking about the decor, but the upkeep.    In no particular order, the issues are, worn and stained draperies. Suspicious stain on the upholstery of the easy chair (we did not want to use the chair). Faded cushions on the dining room chairs, stained and worn marble on the bathroom sink vanity, a tub in serious need of reglazing and worn marble in the tub surround.    Also, due to a really sloppy paint job, there were flecks of paint all over the floor in the kitchen, bath, and hall area. I kept thinking it was sand which needed to be swept up.  The bathroom sink was clogged with an enormous amount of hair when we arrived at the unit. That was taken care of promptly. But that seemed to be the only thing that was easily solve able.    And now you are probably all asking why I didn't ask to be moved. We did not ask to be moved due to an interaction with the desk clerk during check in. The desk clerk mentioned an upgrade. Silly me, I thought we were being upgraded because we were repeat customers. No, he was offering to let us pay $345.00 per night for an upgrade to ocean front, effectively doubling the cost of our stay. After that little conversation, my feeling was that no one would be willing to assist us unless we paid extra for it.    We have never paid for a premium room, and have always found the units in which we stayed to be in very good shape. This was the exception to the rule, and a very bad one it was.    Plus, Spectrum cable was upgrading the modems the week we were there and we got kicked off the wifi in our unit and had to wait for service to be restored.    And don't get me started about the pool and the chaise lounges. The rules are clearly stated about reserving chaise lounges, yet we were never able to find chairs after 9 am, due to the fact that many guests came at 7 am, dumped their towels on the chairs and hogged them all day. I did complain to the front desk about the lack of available lounges at the pool, and I was told that they could do nothing about it. If I had an issue, I was told to speak to the pool concessions and pool security and point out who it was that was hogging the beach chairs. Absolutely not! It should not be up to the guests to police the use of the chaise lounges.    The only reason I am rating it average and not poor is because of our great sentimental attachment to the Whaler.    Add to all this, the erosion of the beach directly fronting the Whaler, and I think it is time to say Aloha and Mahalo... Sigh.",Aug 2019,August 2019,,,"Delray Beach, Florida"

It is nice because it is more affordable than the resorts that surround it and offers spacious units, large lanai’s, wonderful views in the best location on The island. We stayed in unit 869 and rented on VRBO. The owner is great to work with and the unit met all of our needs.

695492969,50,A home away from home.,"This condo was exactly what I would expect from an excellent facility. It is a condo complex in a resort location. It is not a resort in itself, i.e. no restaurants on the property, only a small pool, etc. What you do get is very large rooms, comfortable beds with quality sheets and towels, very clean with daily service, an excellent kitchen with all the required extras to make the kitchen complete, a very large outside patio which was ideal to see the ocean at a 90 degree angle, beautiful birds which would visit us (my wife was even able to hand feed a few of them), an excellent outside area with cooking grills, private underground parking, and a very good concierge service in the lobby for booking various activities. The staff was extremely friendly and always kept hot coffee and fruit flavored tea available from early morning to late afternoon.    This is what we wanted. We felt like this was our home for 6 nights. A mall was only a five minute walk away, convienent for incidentals and shopping if that is your thing. A wonderful Safeway was only a short drive away. So if a condo is what you want and not a disney type resort, then I highly recommend the Whaler.

695045282,40,Great location,"This is a condo complex in a great location. It’s right on Kaanapali Beach next door to the Whaler’s Village shopping center. We stayed in a one bedroom two bath ocean view unit for two weeks. The entire complex is great but our unit (1057) had a few minor issues. First, we had to run the shower for 10 minutes, and that’s not an exaggeration, to get hot water in either bathroom. Second was the WiFi. It was fine as long as we were in the living room with the router. But once we went into another room or on the lanai the signal pretty well went away. Third, the living room furniture, a sofa and love seat, were broken down and uncomfortable. The daily maid service was excellent. We would definitely stay here again. Oh, if your package includes a welcome amenity, don’t count on getting it.

689952910,40,Paradise on the beach minus the negatives,"Just finished a week in Maui with my significant other at this hotel.  The pros: location, location, location! Situated right on Kaanapali Beach, you are steps away from one of the most gorgeous beaches in the world! The strip of beach also hosts many other hotels and eateries and right next door is a shopping center for any needs :) Was fortunate enough to get a high floor ocean view room with a lanai that boasts one of the most gorgeous views! Spent lots of time watching the sunset and sunrise in the comfort from the room! House keeping did a wonderful job each day but the hours varied from morning to late noon but did not matter since we were out most of the day!    Cons: Aside from the gorgeous views, location, ect, my significant other and I had a few negative experiences. Right when we arrived we checked in and at the counter the customer service was not that nice. Ahead of us a family had received necklaces and happy welcomes, as we stepped up to the counter we received less than that and no orientation of the hotel. My significant other felt that we deserved the same encounter as the family ahead but I just brushed it off as oh, maybe it’s because we were traveling as two and we did not have our bags as we had left them in the car until we checked in or that necklaces and welcomes were a special occurrence on some occasions. But we then brought our bags and passed through the lobby again to see if they would greet or give us welcomes, they did not. We had no notion of how to use towel service at the pool, no orientation of water/coffee that was available in the lobby, ect, we had to come back down to get necklaces late at night just to ask because we wanted a token to remember our trip and come back again to ask for a do not disturb sign. The location and beautiful of Maui was perfect but the customer service we encountered was lacking. We were hoping for welcomes to a hotel and state we had not been, but check in was merely a here you go and your room is that way. We were highly disappointed in the front desk crew, at least put on a smile or go over the main hotel amenities! Never had we experienced this and we stay at a lot of hotels during our travels.    If you can get past mediocre customer service this hotel boasts beautiful views and location with a hotel that’s not crowded, and solely based on that we would return as long as it’s a high floor ocean view room. Other good things: we were celebrating our anniversary and we entered the room to chocolates! I would say this hotel would get a 5/5 from us IF the front desk employees treat every hotel guests with smiles and actually take time to explain hotel and amenities ect. We will be back for the views and comfort and location of the hotel, but we were very disappointed in service. If this hotel wasn’t located in Maui, did not have beautiful views, and was not on the beach we would not be back.",Jul 2019,July 2019,Traveled as a couple,,

We really enjoyed grilling outside and jumped in the pool and jacuzzi everyday. Pool towels were provided by the hotel and we could exchange anytime we wanted.

We had access to washer and dryer for FREE in each floor and that was great! I'd love to return to this condominium again!",Jul 2019,June 2019,,,
686577706,30,"Amenities, service and beach directly in front of property are a letdown","Overall, the room, customer service, amenities, and the strip of beach directly in front of the property were disappointing and we saw numerous cockroaches in the building; however, it was a very calm and relatively adult vibe, the proximity to whaler's village was nice, and it was nice to be in a condo with a kitchen. But there are several properties on Kaanapali that fit that bill, so I would not stay here again, if I had other options.    I would not book this property through costco, hotels.com, tripadvisor, etc. - I would only book direct through an owner so you know what you are getting. However, the service, amenities and beach leave a lot to be desired compared to neighbor properties.    After another resort canceled our reservation without notice we booked a studio on the 10th floor in the Molokai/north tower with a view of Black Rock (not facing the inner courtyard) through costco travel. This was not ideal, but we had very few options.    We were assigned a random studio and it was not upgraded/premium. Overall it was extremely dated with calcium and grunge build-up, badly damaged furniture, mold/gunk in the horrible fluorescent light fixtures, and total lack of any art or decor to make it feel a little like home - just a very bare plain room with old and damaged furnishings. Very disappointing. We asked to change rooms and they were unable to accommodate our request, which was also disappointing - but turned out to be par for the course at this property.    Redeeming qualities were that the bed was comfy and new, so that helped a lot. The sliding doors to the patio were also really nice, and included a screen so we could sleep with the doors open without letting in bugs. The room was very large and spacious. The view of black rock was nice, but directly below, you just look out onto the top of the hotel next door, which is unsightly and kind of obstructive. Unfortunately, there is a pretty loud AC unit on top of the hotel next door (Kaanapali Beach Hotel), which was annoying at first and I thought would end up drowning out the sound of the waves - but luckily we got used to it, and you could hear the waves really well later in the evening when other noise died down.    The hot tub is big and nice, well heated and with good jets. The pool is warm but unexciting. The area around the pool is very small and you can't really see the beach. If you sit in there you might as well be sitting at a hotel pool in your hometown (or somewhere that doesn't charge $400+/nt).    As of our stay in late June 2019, due to recent erosion of the beach directly in front of the hotel they are not renting out ""cabanas"" (which are just dual lounge chairs) or letting guests use the single regular lounge chairs - so the only option for the beach is these dinky little upright sitting chairs that are not nice or comfortable. Obviously, I do not advocate contributing to erosion, but if a nice stretch of beach and beach chairs are something you are looking for (which I was), I would stay at literally any other hotel on Kaanapali Beach (KBH on one side up to Sheraton, and Westin on the other side all the way down to Hyatt is not having this erosion problem to the degree that the Whaler is and they all have their beach chairs out).    Plus, they don't have a lot of the upright chairs, so they ran out our first two days (and ran out of the tommy bahama folding chairs that they rent for an exorbitant price) and all pool chairs with umbrellas were taken. We were stuck baking in the sun all day. They charge $20 a day for a sand umbrella (with no chairs) - but were also out of these. When they finally had them back in stock a few days later we rented an umbrella for 2 days at $40 -- which is just absurd considering how terrible their seating situation had been for most of our trip. Total rip off and pool/beach staff really didn't seem to empathize at all or care about our day /enjoyment of the beach. One would think they could comp us an umbrella or reduce the fee given the circumstances.    When we initially arrived around 10pm, we were told we would need to hand carry all of our luggage to our room ourselves - no bell person and not even a cart to use. That was a disappointing and rather abrupt welcome.    The grounds are pretty mediocre looking.    Other than the cleaning staff (which were good), we barely ever saw staff, but they were not helpful at any point when we needed things.    Proximity to whaler's village is nice - but it's no more than a 5 minute walk from any of the hotels on this strip of Kaanapali beach, so this is not unique to the whaler.",Jul 2019,June 2019,Traveled as a couple,"Would only book premium/upgraded, if at all","San Francisco, California"

685522859,50,"Outstanding Condo, Excellent Staff, Perfect Location","Family of 4 stayed in condo 1170, in the south tower (2), up on the 11th floor facing north toward black rock so being that high up we had spectacular views of black rock, the ocean and the west Maui mountains!  We booked directly with the owner via VRBO and the process was very smooth. He answered all our questions and made us feel very welcomed. And WOW! What a beautiful condo! It was a one bedroom, two full bathrooms and had both a large sectional fold out and a Murphy bed, so the 4 of us had plenty of space. It was updated with high end finishes, granite and stainless in the kitchen, large tub/shower combos with nice tile finishes, dimmer switches on all lights, high thread count sheets, large closets, a second entry way we didn’t use but was great to store our luggage out of the way. The condo also had dual air conditioning, so the bedroom had its own controller separate from the living/kitchen area. This was awesome for us to have because my wife and I like it really cold at night and the kids were still comfortable with their air a little higher.  The patio was huge! Accessible from both the bedroom and living room with huge sliding glass doors, it had two loungers, a high top table and 6 high chairs and still plenty of room to walk around! The condo also came with stuff for the beach like soft coolers, two beach chairs and an umbrella, and a couple boogie boards. We also left an inter-tube and a smaller boogie board for the next guests to use.  There were some condiments in the fridge as well as coffee/filters, and some spices for cooking. Anything we had left or was left for the next guests too.  Having a full size washer and dryer in the unit was nice and convenient too! Overall condo #1170 was outstanding and I can not recommend it enough!  The whaler complex itself was also very nice. The staff were all very nice and helpful. The facilities and grounds were all kept very clean. The courtyard is beautiful and groundskeepers do an excellent job! We didn’t use the spa or fitness facilities so I can’t speak to those. The pool looked small but nice. We never went to it but it was always full of people enjoying it. The grills outside were nice and well kept. The beach towel exchange process was nice and simple and always tons of towels available. Beach chairs were available for use but sometimes were all taken so it was nice our condo had two of their own for us to use. Main parking is underground and overflow lot is close right by the tennis courts. We never had an issue finding a spot underground, and the elevators go down to garage level so to easy to access.  The beach in front of the whaler is very clean, clear beautiful water with no coral so it’s great to walk around and play in. The beach itself isn’t as wide as other parts of Kaanapali but still plenty of space to set up for the day and not feel like you’re right next to others. It’s also cool to be so close to black rock to walk down and snorkel and jump off!  The location is also nice being right next to the whaler shopping village that has lots of shops, restaurants, and an ABC store which is nice if ya need anything and don’t not want to drive to Safeway.  Speaking of, Safeway is very close, and Lahaina town is fun to go walk front street to shop, eat, drink, see the banyon tree,etc.  A few recommendations from our experiences would be snorkeling at Kapalua and Honolua Bay, PT Fleming beach and Big Beach for relaxing. Blue Hawaiian helicopter tour was fantastic! Lunch at Momma’s Fish House was ok. It’s a beautiful place but the food was just ok, and the service was slow so overall we felt it wasn’t worth their exorbitant prices!  The Maui Nui Luau at the Sheraton was ok. The show was short but entertaining, the food was really good but the whole pig roast presentation wasn’t even announced so we missed it, and we couldn’t really see the black rock jumper over everyone’s head and cameras being held up. But, it was convenient to be able to walk there from the whaler so that was nice, plus the good food made it ok.  Overall HIGHLY recommend the whaler condo 1170!

The only thing I would caution is the beach right in front of the buildings are eroding, so you cannot use the beach right in front. Not a problem for us as we used the complimentary beach chairs and moved our location down towards black rock. The beach chairs are complimentary but the loungers are for rent. The fitness facilities were perfect, small area but had all the right equipment. Highly recommend these units if you need the space, plan to perhaps cook yourself, or just don’t need the big resort feel. We had no issues getting seats at the pool unlike like some resorts.

667503008,50,Fantastic Service!,"Currently staying in unit # 1119, a 1-bedroom premium ocean view. Based on reviews we were somewhat nervous about what the condition of the room would be. This unit is just great for our purposes! It’s large, airy & has a decent amount of storage even though a significant number of drawers & closets are locked off for the owner. The unit is somewhat updated with granite counters in the kitchen & bath, decent appliances & sufficient pots, pans, & utensils for most cooking purposes. On the other hand, the living room furniture is old style tropical rattan and not very comfortable. I’m also not a big fan of the carpet in the living room & bedroom, even though it seems clean. Although this isn’t a 5-star unit, everything is clean, and the bed is comfortable.    The OUTSTANDING part of our stay has been the staff. A few things here and there have needed repair & all it took to resolve each issue was a quick call to the front desk. Unbelievably great, TIMELY service.    Some of the other things I like are the attention to security, how immaculate the grounds are, & the quick access to the beach & beachwalk.    We are glad we rented through Aston rather than directly from an owner, as we appreciate the daily housekeeping & that toilet paper, paper towels, & hand, dish & dishwasher soap are provided (unlike most condos we’ve rented.)",Apr 2019,April 2019,Traveled as a couple,,"Salem, Oregon"

665050313,10,Whaler 963 and 965,"DO NOT RENT EITHER OF THESE UNITS. I rented both of these units for a week, for my wife and I and for my son and his girlfriend. One of the primary reasons for staying at a beach front condo/hotel is that we like to leave our balcony door open at all times to hear the ocean waves and feel the ocean breezes. Needless to say, it is also very enjoyable to sit on the balcony and enjoy this experience. However, this side of the condo building abuts up against “The Whaler Village”, which includes a number of restaurants and retail shops directly below. Though we were well above the outdoor mall (9th floor – Units 963 and 965), we could not hear the ocean, at all, because of the constant (24/7) din of the ventilation systems from the businesses below. It was lovely hearing birds chirping at 6:15am but they were interrupted almost every morning by trucks, backing up to make their deliveries to the businesses below. We have stayed in the Whaler Resort, three or four times previously, including a stay several floors directly these two units. (We’ve always loved The Whaler). We have never experienced this. Upon checking out, I was asked by a front desk staff member about our stay. I explained how awful the sound was and that we had never encountered that before at the Whaler. The staff member explained that a number of trees, between our condo building and the restaurants/shops next door had been removed, because they blocked some of the view for the lower units. However, now, there is nothing muffling the noise from the ventilation systems below. The only remedy is to stay on the north side of Tower 2 or either side of Tower 1. This noise factor should be disclosed to potential guests staying in units on the south side of Tower 2 and the unit should be heavily discounted because of it. Otherwise, you will be paying a premium amount of money for a far less than satisfactory experience. Note: I should mention that aside from the noise issue on the south side of Tower 2, I would give the Whaler an excellent rating.",Apr 2019,April 2019,Traveled with family,"Rent on the north side of Tower 2 or either side of Tower 1, not on the south side of Tower 2","Oceanside, California"

The unit we stay in is absolutely beautiful, clean beyond belief, everything you could need for a wonderful stay. And having a washer and dryer in unit was perfect, I actually got home with no laundry to deal with! With a wrap around lanai it is just perfect for sunsets, sunrises and whale watching. Cannot tell you how many times we just sat and spotted whale after whale. Our unit was a one bedroom, 2 bath, with tons of room to spread out. Happy hour was always on our lanai with our friends who were in another unit.    The Whaler resort is a great property, the lobby area is so inviting which looks out onto the koi pond, which is cleaned constantly. We never use the pool, why would you when the ocean is at your doorstep and gorgeous at that. The beach hut has all your needs, there are free beach chairs, pretty basic, fine for my husband but I did rent the Tommy Bahama reclining beach chair. Our unit had a beach umbrella which we used. The beach is unbelievable, waves galore and on our last day we ventured in to do some body surfing, I'm sure we looked hilarious! A great walking beach to get in some exercise. Everyone we encountered at the Whaler were wonderful.

657926286,50,Great place to stay,"Just got back yesterday! We stayed for one week in early March as a family of 3 and stayed in room 856. The kitchen was fully stocked, room was clean and spacious, bed was large and amazing! We originally booked a studio but upgraded to a one bedroom and bath which was so worth it with a baby. The unit faces onto the courtyard and you can see the ocean towards black rock and the mountains which was so nice. The lanai was also large and spacious with dining chairs as well as comfy lounge chairs. We didnt have great weather so spent a lot of time there. One thing to note is that in the tower 2 you dont get a lot of sunshine like tower 1 does. The whaler also provided us a clean pack and play for our little baby which we appreciated. The only room for improvement would be the shower which seemed to need a little updating (took awhile to get hot water and sometimes shower and bath would run together so we would get wet when trying to bathe our baby) and the coffee provided but no big deal it didn't affect our stay. There are no restaurants or bars on site so loved that the hotel was so close to whalers village next door with good restaurant options. Lots of parking and staff very friendly. Pool is a little on the cold side and not as lively as other hotels but not a big deal. We didnt spend much time there. I would recommend the whaler to anyone trying to decide.

The bathroom has been renovated and has a very nice shower. The unit was clean and had a very nice appearance. The kitchen was also well equipped. There were extras like a beach umbrella, cooler and beach chairs, too.    The negatives: The location of the unit is third floor and right next to the elevator. The elevator lobby is open to the outdoors. The entrance to the building is located directly below the elevator lobby. Because we were on a low floor, people in the courtyard and the elevator lobby would YELL at each other at all hours - including late evenings. Sitting on the deck was very unpleasant because of the noise. We had poor weather and spent a little more time on the lanai and in the condo then we normallywould do and we found this very unpleasant.    The unit itself was very nice. However, we were not able to unpack (no dresser). For longer stays, we always unpack, so we missed having a dresser.    The unit is 5 stars, and it's important to note that the issues are not with the owner but with the the inconsiderate behavior of other guests.",Mar 2019,February 2019,Traveled as a couple,"Tower I courtyard view is the ""sunny side"".

Now the bad... The reason it's not 5 stars is because if your balcony is on the side of the Whaler that overlooks Whalers Village, the air conditioning units and delivery truck noise from down below drowns out any peaceful enjoyment of the view and balcony.

Parking after 6pm underground would fill up quickly and you would have to use the outside car parking. As this is an apartment complex there are quite a few owners cars stored underneath in the carpark. The car spaces were quite big as well.

The beach, the pool, the beautiful koi pond and garden area, the mountain view to the east. Just wow. The room was super clean, and well appointed with everything we needed.

Since our kids are older, we would let them walk to Whaler’s Village (right next door) and shop or get ice cream.

Shower nice walk in stone floor, glass, very nice shampoo, conditioner, lotion, shower wash. All dishes provided although this unit could have used another medium size pot with lid and lid for frying pan. Dish soap and laundry soap provided. Laundry room down the hall-didn't use but handy enough. Balcony (lanai) was good size for sitting out with morning coffee. Dried our suits on the chairs. Kitchen had blender, toaster, mini dishwasher, ice maker type fridge was a nice touch. Being on the second floor was nice- we just walked down and out to the beach. Little shower outside off the beach to get the sand off before you go in. These are located all along the beach in various locations. Being right on Kaanapali and the north end of the beach closer to Black Rock was AWESOME. We could snorkle at Black Rock daily even if the waves were big on the rest of the beach as this little spot was a bit more protected. Staff at Aston The Whaler were wonderful. I didn't like the scents/smell in the room-too flowery for me so head of cleaning (sorry forgot the lovely lady's name) came and checked out the whole room to make sure there was nothing amiss, removed the scented air freshener and the live potted flower and then surprised us with a basket of goodies like banana loaf, popcorn, etc. So nice. No restaurant or bar in The Whaler which is kinda nice. Lots to choose from along the beach walk on Kaanapali (check my other reviews on those). Front desk staff helpful. Our flight was at 8 pm leaving Maui and checkout was 11 am. Asked for later checkout but they had someone booked into the room so couldn't which is totally reasonable.

The unit was very nicely decorated, comfortable beds and sofa bed (kids slept there!). Each room had lanai access. Lanai was a huge, wraparound as our room was on the front corner overlooking the koi pond common area, pool and beaches. Family really enjoyed both the pool and the beach.

The location is by far the best thing about this hotel. We walked up and down the beach to take a look at the other mega-sized resorts. We found the Aston to be perfectly suited to our needs. The 4/5 is because each unit is independently owned, so the furnishings and updates of each unit depend on the owner. Unfortunately, our unit was outdated with kitschy island furniture from the 80’s.

This place is beyond clean, there's BBQ's if you'd like to use, and from our balcony we saw them being cleaned every morning, the beach is the best, the pool and hot tub are super clean. Short walk over to Black Rock and you can snorkel and see the turtles, also a few steps from Whalers Village where the shopping is great for a rainy day (Sephora, Lulu, etc). Theres a bit of a boardwalk to jog or walk between hotels, you can rent snorkel equipment or anything else right there. I accidentally left a couple coats there and the housekeeping manager was excellent in helping me retrieve them. Cant say enough good things about this place. The next time we come back, theres no question, this is where we will stay.

Great snorkelling out your front door at black rock.  Unit t 1224 is nothing short of spectacular, right on the top corner with a wrap around lanai.  Great facilities, BBQ, Gym, Spa, pool.  Upped their game every year for the past 10 with extensive renovations.  Beautiful gardens, Koi pond.  Good parking (included in $20 a day resort fee).  Walk to great restaurants, shopping at Whaler’s.  Walk to 2 great golf courses.  Cons  Noisy garbage trucks etc.  Lot of driving if you want to shop Costco, golf Kihei etc.  Anyone complains about the Whaler hasn’t been in unit 1224.",Nov 2018,November 2018,Traveled as a couple,,"Vancouver, Canada"
635079031,40,Our Long Deserved 12 Day Holiday!,"We have had the fortune of being able to visit Maui now 4 times! It is heaven on earth! This our first visit to the Aston Whaler, right by the ocean! The location is perfect being by the ocean with an excellent view and a short walk to the boardwalk and the nearby village square. We a very short walk to a community bus which can get us to Lahaina in 8 minutes, loaded with shops and restaurants as well as a ferry to Lanai!  Got in last nights and a great meal and listened to music for a few hours! The Whaler has got a great location and is a peaceful spot if you want to get away! It doesn’t have restaurants or entertainment as those are close by. I would agree with its 3 star plusrating as it has aged a bit and showing its age. Grounds are really beautiful with a nice but small pool given the number of rooms.  We go to the Maui Westin on November 25! Maybe another adventure?

632665858,50,Brilliant Location,"We have just spent a week at the Aston at The Whaler Kaanapali, and we were sorry to leave. It is an apartment (condo) hotel right on the beach at Kaanapali. We stayed on the sixth floor in an ocean front apartment and it was fabulous. The living room was spectacular with sliding glass doors overlooking the sea; the kitchen was fully equipped—except for a kettle: to make tea each morning we boiled water in a saucepan. The coffee maker looked a bit complicated. Our apartment had a comfortable king sized bed and two full bathrooms. The building has laundry rooms, on each floor I think, and there is no cost to use the machines.    The Aston has a kiosk near the pool where we hired snorkeling gear ($20pp for 24 hours), and we were able to swim about 30 metres off shore and swim with two large turtles, who seemed undisturbed by our presence. The hotel staff, from reception to ground staff to housekeeping, were unfailingly friendly and polite.    We played three games of golf at the nearby Kaanapali Golf Courses, the Kai and the Royal. They were close enough for us to walk to; the Kai Course was less challenging and not quite as pretty as The Royal.    When we return to Maui we would definitely stay here again.",Nov 2018,November 2018,Traveled with friends,,"Rothbury, Australia"

631810282,40,Beautiful area and grounds. great location,"Stayed here for a week on a family trip. Booked through Costco with a package that included the hotel and a rental car. Overall this is a fantastic location - the hotel itself is in a great location, right on the beach and immediately next to the Whaler's village, which was convenient for restaurants and especially the ABC store, good for knick knacks such as snacks, beverages and goodies.    pros:  - location is right on the beach. In the Kanapali area which is driving distance to Front street in Lanai, or if you dont want to drive the whaler village next door offers shops, restaurants and a convenience store.  - the pool is nice, its a decent size and located right next to the beach. We encountered many friendly people at the pool. We were with a group that included small children, which the hotel accommodates/tolerates but doesn't cater to. We didnt feel alienated because of the kids  -the room was beautiful. However the room we were in was a timeshare, so YMMV when it comes to amenities and the age of the furnishings.  -Koi pond - the grounds are beautiful and include a koi pond. You can feed the fish every morning at 8:30, a fun activity especially for the little ones.  -The beach is fantastic - when we went there was plenty of sand on the beach. There isnt a reef in front of the hotel for snorkeling, but to the north lies black rock beach, about a 10 minute walk. This is a prime snorkeling/scuba area. I went on a night scuba dive at black rock and it was full of sealife. (surge was very strong at the most westernmost point, so beware)    Cons  -I had to fight the front desk person for a good room. He originally tried to put us in a room on the 2nd floor, saying that was a 2 bed, 2 bath room. When I asked what else was available he mentioned a higher room that was smaller and he didnt recommend.  When we looked at both, turns out he lied about the size of the nicer room, and was disgruntled when we decided to ignore his advice and took the higher floor. That left a bad taste in my mouth, but on the bright side the higher floor was absolutely beautiful.  -Room service was spotty - they only cleaned our room 2x out of the 8 night we were there. The housekeepers would show up at the very end of the day, if at all. this meant they couldn't wait 30 minutes to clean the room as they were at the end of their shift. I imagine this is an exception rather than the rule, but detracted from our experience.    Overall, a 9 out of 10 experience. The only downside was the interaction with the deceitful front desk staff. My recommendation for others is to be insistent on actually seeing the available rooms and choosing the one you prefer, don't rely on the staff to choose for you.",Nov 2018,September 2018,Traveled with family,the higher the better,"Costa Mesa, California"

631496135,40,Fabulous Location; Mediocre Unit,"This unit, 1273, overlooks the Whaler Shops and Restaurants. The exhaust fans below and delivery trucks backing up completely ruin the experience of enjoying the amazing views on the massive lanai. For the price paid, this unit was a disappointment. Beer and wine hospitality gift was a nice touch, the views are amazing, and the unit is large with great air conditioning. There were only two usable beach chairs and they were in terrible condition. When you pay a premium price, beach gear is typically included in Hawaii. The cooler was terrible but there was a decent beach umbrella. Ceiling fan remotes were missing batteries and quite frankly the unit was not clean to our standards. We had to keep our shoes on to keep our feet clean. Bathroom rugs were dirty, carpets in bedrooms were stained. Bottom line, you're paying to be on Kaanapali beach but the unit needs renovations and the location within the building is LOUD out on the beautiful lanai. My favorite part of the day is morning coffee on the lanai and a nightcap on the lanai. Not this lanai. The noise is unbearable. Overall the resort is great, but I wouldn't pick this unit again.

This was not as well appointed as our condo but all the same, very nice. I would stay here over any hotel, as you may well know, Maui is not a cheap place to vacate, so serviced appartments make for a good choice. I like to make my own coffee and bagels in the morning. And as I am relaxing on the beach I can return for lunch, rather than eating out all the time. A wonderful place, recommended for families and couples alike.",Nov 2018,October 2018,,,"Vimy, France"

All the staff were excellent and very helpful.    The rooms as others have stated have a full range of facilities including full kitchen should you need one.    My only minor negative comments would be:    Resort fees I do not like these and believe they simply hide the true cost of rooms. Items like Wi-Fi, pool towels and sun loungers should be standard so I’m not sure what else the extra fee is for.    Also whilst sun loungers are provided this does not apply if you want to use them on the beach (they do have free chairs for the beach) the cost of $40 for someone to carry the loungers and put up a sun umbrella on the beach just seems high, and tends to be free in other areas of the world .",Oct 2018,September 2018,Traveled as a couple,,

We've stayed there several times in the past, and keep coming back The apartments in the building are all privately owned, so you can rent direct from an owner, or rent from Aston. Our 12th floor studio apartment had huge ocean, pool, and outer island views. The remodeled apartment was comfortable, very clean and had a full sized kitchen. There are two very nice BBQ areas where it is very easy to meet people from all over the world that stay at, or own apartments at the Whaler. The Whaler staff is very friendly and helpful. From the time you drive through the gated entrance, the staff knows your name and is always smiling. The Bellmen meet you at the lobby entrance to take care of you luggage if you like. Fred was our Bellman, and he was great! The desk staff gets you checked in a hurry and you're all set to go. The grounds are beautiful. There is a large Coy pond surround by very well kept grounds with lots of tropical vegetation. The ocean front pool is just steps from the beach. The concierge staff at the pool can help you with any activity you may want to try. Michael, Joseph, and Dillon are great at what they do, and and will keep you laughing while they're at it. The Whaler pool crew of Manny, James, and Samu keep the pool humming along, and always have a smile for you. We think the Whaler is the most convienient location on the beach.

619604728,50,Room 560 - so many wonderful things about this place!,"We really loved this room, it faces the courtyard and the ocean. We were celebrating our anniversary and wanted a special view and location. We booked through our Chase Sapphire Reserve card rewards and the room initially chosen for us was a lower level room facing the Whaler Village. We asked if we could have another room with a better view/location and we were willing to pay for the upgrade and the staff was so helpful in accommodating! They let us choose between the 10th floor ""ocean front"" (2 bed 2 bath) or room 560 (5th floor, 1 bed/2bath). The 10th floor room was gigantic, super gorgeous, and had it's own washer/dryer but we felt it was too big for just us 2. Normally we'd love a room like that as it felt like a mini penthouse but this time we wanted something a little more cozier and room 560 fit the bill! It's half the size of the 10th floor room BUT it felt so warm and cozy and perfect for us! It's still quite a spacious condo. Gotta go with the gut feel right! This room does not have a washer and dryer, but the laundry room is located next to the elevators and this room is close enough to the elevators so it's not a hassle doing laundry. They provide you with Cheer laundry detergent daily. As for the toiletries, it was by Tropical Hawaiian brand - loved the scents! The main bathroom shower is AMAZING, the rain shower installed is just wonderful. The kitchen is fully stocked with utensils, plates, bowls, baking pans, pots, cups, mugs etc! The wardrobe is spacious and comes with nice clothes hangers and a safe. The bed was comfortable and we loved the housekeeping service, they were so quick on days we wanted our room tidied up and they are flexible with your schedule. All you have to do is call the front desk the morning of, and let them know what time frame would work for them to enter your unit. The pool is lovely (next to the beach) and the staff overall is great. The resort's proximity to the Whaler Village and other hotels/beach spots through the beachfront sidewalk was so convenient. We also are close to the Trilogy III boat's launch point, so if you're planning a snorkeling/boating trip, you're literally a 2-5 minute walk there! How cool is that, you don't even have to drive to Lahaina or Maalaea - unless you prefer a different company/boat. If you're wanting to see the sunset from your lanai every evening, this condo won't do because of how it's angled, but, a super short walk down to the beach front for the sunset view is not a bad compromise!    Emergency plan experience - during our stay, the island was hit with Tropical Storm Olivia. Due the fact that no one could predict the impact of this storm, the resort staff took conservative emergency precautions and sent everyone a letter advising the emergency preparedness process. In addition, throughout the whole day before the storm was due to hit land, they announced through the fire alarm system the game plan. Loved the thorough communication received because not everyone is inside their condo at the same time as others, so varying the announcements helps to ensure most would get the message. While the alarm system was loud and probably annoying to some, that's the whole point of an emergency announcement right! Surely got our attention :)    Special kudos to Dexter, Doris and the tall gentlemen (I forgot his name gah!) who was our bellman for going wayyyy above and beyond their call of duty to make our experience memorable. Many thanks! We will definitely be coming back. I can't wait for our next trip!",Sep 2018,September 2018,,,"San Diego, CA"

Every room has a balcony and as far as I could tell, a view from that balcony of the beach and ocean. Some rooms, though, overlook the whalers village restaurants and shops. We didn’t stay in one of those but viewed one, which I think was up on the 6th floor. We could not hear the ocean from there, just the generators on the rooftops of the restaurant and shop buildings. That was important to us, so we shifted to a courtyard view room. That was lovely, with a view of the ocean, as well as the quiet courtyard.  The staff is friendly, including the housekeeping crew.

617747596,10,They treat ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY MEMBERS like second rate citizens,"#1- They will charge a 2 nights deposit for your room if you select the MILITARY rate. However, if you select “government” (which isn’t that the same??) they charge nothing. When I asked why, they couldn’t answer, in fact the receptionist was quite nasty.  #2- The rooms here are all individually owned and you don’t know what you’re gonna get. We stayed in May and as an ACTIVE DUTY military member, we were given a loud room right by the elevator and main walkway downstairs. Wow, really? Then the bed had a huge hole in the center. We don’t spend much time in the room, so the location didn’t bother us much, but the bed did. It was also not decorated nice, too cluttered. The owners stache their nice mattress in a locked area and when they come back to vacation, they toss the crappy mattress in there and move in their premium mattress. Bad! The owners should be required to at minimum keep decent mattresses on the beds for guests. Not good for the Aston name.  #3- They charge a hefty “resort” fee. I’m sorry, but this place is NOT a resort. Dinky pool, zero amenities and you’ll barely get towels replaced. I priced the Westin just next door and it was $11/night CHEAPER at the Westin- a REAL resort.  Shame on Aston.

Every day room service came and room cleaned thoroughly and restocked. The beach is my fav. The beach right in front of Whaler is perfect- nothing but soft sand and gentle waves- and so clear you could see down 3-4 feet. The whaler even provided chairs to sit on free of charge. The pool had tons of chairs- umbrellas and even had tea and water station set up if you got thirsty!  we always found a chair and the pool water was blue and immaculate. The concierge -CHERI - was a doll. Sooooo helpful and friendly and saved us money on some activities. Thanks bunches Cheri. no surprises- efficient service and friendly people.

614884212,40,Stunning Views.......... but.........,"We arrived at Aston at The Whaler after having flown all night and then getting another flight from Honolulu to Maui. To say we were exhausted is an understatement. I had phoned two weeks prior to confirm our booking, the staff were aware, informed me they would have things sorted and all would be well. Upon arrival at around 11am the staff were totally disinterested in us. We were told we couldn’t have our room yet but we could go next door to Whalers. We did this, including having some lunch so returned just after 1pm. The staff totally ignored us, We were not offered a thing, a drink or an update. We sat in the lobby for the next THREE hours nodding off! It was hot, we need to lie down, we needed our room. During this time we witnessed multiple other parties arriving, being very much welcomed and being shown to their rooms immediately. By this stage we were more than annoyed. At 3.57pm we were told in a most unkind fashion that check in was 4pm and our room was ready. The key cards were literally shoved towards us with the room number scrawled on the envelope. We had no idea where the room was or even which tower it was in. This trip was for our 30th Wedding Anniversary and we were not off to a good start. We arrived in room 1051 where the views were to die for. It was a “Premium” room and we had paid extraordinary money for it. As some sort of apology someone bought a bag of “things” as in snacks to our room delivered in a rubbish bag! Next morning the housekeeper was knocking at 8.30am, we said that we weren’t ready to leave for the day and could she return in an hour. She was grumpy and said “YOU come and find me”. She never returned, we then had to request fresh towels and had no service that day. The unit itself was clean but old, the walls were badly dinged and the decor was dated and a bit sad. It let the place down. We decided to use the pool but were given no towel cards so had to sort that out before we could enjoy the facilities. Ka’anapali is simply beautiful. The grounds of the Aston at the Whaler were beautifully kept, the views were stunning.

The kitchen was excellent with a big fridge with an ice maker which we used everyday to keep our drinks cool in our chiller bag.

The grounds themselves are gorgeous and tended daily. The room we were in was exceptionally clean and well appointed. The kitchen was very serviceable, and bath/shower facilities were superb. Sitting on our lanai each morning to enjoy the warmth and the view of the ocean was a delight. Upon arriving home, we missed The Whaler and Kaanapali Beach so much that already in June we made reservations for 10 days in 2019.

The sunsets from the wrap-around oceanfront balcony were so incredible, we delayed going to dinner until later every evening so we wouldn’t miss it. The views of Kaanapali were amazing. The condo has been completely redone and had more than we could possibly have needed. The finishes were beautiful, everything looked brand new and updated. We enjoyed being steps from the beach, with the ability to hang back by the pool if we wanted. This was the most beautiful place we have ever stayed and we will definitely be returning. It was the perfect place to relax and be away together before our little one arrives.",Aug 2018,June 2018,Traveled as a couple,,

While the staff is extra friendly and helpful, the ocean is wonderful and the beach is nice (although usually smaller during the winter months if the waves get big), every day at around 2:30pm or 3pm the trash dumpsters are moved from the back of tower II all the way out near the tennis courts (roughly the length of a football field). The way they are taken out is via a forklift driving in reverse there AND back, multiple dumpsters are moved noisily along lasting nearly 2 hours. Since the forklift is in reverse the whole time, it blares that overly loud and obnoxious beeping over and over BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP. Want to take a nap or just relax and read a book on your lanai at that time? Forget it, to make it worse the noise bounces between the buildings.    Apparently the dumpsters used to be emptied behind the building by having the trash truck just pull right up there. Someone complained about it and now everyone else suffers the consequences of the new beeping forklift system. The good of the one outweighed the good of the many. Until they solve this noise issue, be ready for noisy afternoons at The Whaler.",Aug 2018,July 2018,Traveled with family,,"Honolulu, Hawaii"
602424400,50,The Whaler staff is so NICE and FRIENDLY!,"My daughter and I stayed for 5 nights in mid July. She is only 13 and it was our first time to Hawaii. WE HAD A BLAST! The Whaler staff was welcoming from the check-in to check-out, extremely helpful, always with an ""aloha""! and a smile. NO ONE, and I mean not even the gardeners acted like our questions bothered them.    The room was beautifully appointed and very comfortable. We got an upgraded ocean-view room in Tower 1, floor 4. I loved the automatic climate-control generated by whether the lanai doors were open or not. The room was cleaned and Veronica left a nice note and chocolates every day. The kitchen was fully functional with everything we needed to make a meal. Whalers Village is steps away and has EVERYTHING anyone would need for their stay. The Whaler is a WONDERFUL place and it's perfect for seniors, adults, young adults, families and YES, INCLUDING children. There were children all over the place having a fantastic time. Some parents just seem to think the world should stop to cater to THEIR children. Ummm, NO.    The only thing that went a bit wrong was the fact that when we got to our room, the complimentary pineapple I had read about and seen was no where to be found. However, about an hour more or less, someone knocks on the door, with the biggest ""ALOHA""! and starts handing me gift after gift, lol. We got our delicious decorated pineapple, two coffee mugs, two cute leis, a bag of cookies, a bag of coffee, and 3 bread loafs flavored pineapple and banana, AND a bottle of red wine! I think they piled on the gifts because they didn't have the pineapple in the fridge upon our arrival which is their signature. But, truth be told, our flight landed early and we got to the hotel room hours earlier than check-in time and STILL they gave us NO HASSLE about checking in. It was so smooth, I forgot we were early!    Anyway, the ocean was beautiful, clear, and warm. Just right to cool you off without making you freeze. It was perfect. I can't say enough about The Waler and the staff. I've already recommended it to several people!    Thanks, The Whaler, for making this mother/daughter trip relaxing and amazing. It was perfect.",Aug 2018,July 2018,Traveled with family,,"Los Angeles, California"
601354039,30,Better suits seniors,"We selected this place based on reviews here. Initially booked at Four Seasons but the price was as twice as this place. Location is the best- west Maui is the place to be. Kaapalai beach us gorgeous . I think it won nomination of the best beach in US for 2013 or so. Water is very clean but be aware about rip currents. Beach is just wonderful.  Property has two towers. We wanted to stay in tower 1 as we were concerned about the noise in Whaler village construction. I called few times in advance to make sure that we got #1. Although the property clearly states that they don't guarantee the tower, we have expected some flexibility as we were staying for two weeks with the toddler . Vacation for $5k+ was not convincing enough so we finally got a room at tower 2 most far from the ocean. Thanks it was the other side from Whaler construction. Check in was painful. We were exhausted after almost a full day of travel + we had a small kid with us.. Process took half an hour at least. Lady was not welcoming to say the least if not rude. You expect something different when you come to paradise. Staff on the reception didn't carry the badge so I can't mention them.    Room was spacious. We had one bed room with double bath. Full kitchen. There was no need to buy anything. Although few minor obstacles, the Apartment was clean and neat. Cleaning was done everyday, however, we couldn’t figure out the timing. One day it could be first half of the day and another – second half. That was not particularly convenient as our daughter usually had an afternoon nap.  Pool area was overcrowded and relatively small given the number of guests. We had to come earlier to secure the place in shadow for our daughter.  They have outdoor grills that was fantastic for evening barbecue. Reception area has self service kiosk for airline check in. It didn’t work so I asked reception for help. The lady had no special desire to help. Overall reception needs much improvement.

600596261,40,What you need to know when staying at The Whaler,"I booked a last minute trip to Maui, Hawaii (I haven't been before). Stayed at this hotel for 6 nights at the end of July 2018.  1 - Location. I think the location is supreme (given that I had no time to do any thorough research prior to booking). It's right on the beach, next door (literally) to the small shopping center with shops, and restaurants. A golf course separates the strip of hotels from the highway. The Whaler seems to be exactly in the middle of the beach walk between the Westin and the Sheraton. It's a ten minute drive to the Lahaina - a very busy touristy town with gazillions of shops, galleries and great restaurants. I much prefer to stay in Kaanapali because it's not as crowded and cars are not driving close to the hotel.  2 - Beach. Great, white sand beaches with lots of room for everybody not to be on top of each other. You can walk a little bit away from the main entrance by the hotel and get more space around you. Water is clear, warm and gorgeous turquoise color.  3 - Rooms. I got a one bedroom with ocean view on the 10th floor #1057 at Tower 2. No complains about the room. The room windows face the shopping side area. The downside - it's a bit noisy from the A/Cs working in the shopping center and you can hear the music. A/Cs are a bit of a bummer, but music was setting the vacation mood. The other side of this tower building faces the tower 1 building and the large koi pond. I assume this side should be much quieter, but it seems to have only evening sun.  I saw some reviews saying rooms' furniture and decor is a bit outdated. My room had wicker furniture, which does make the room look a bit like it's 80's or something. But I don't see why a rental room by the beach needs to have different kind of furniture. The room was clean, A/C was working great, kitchen had more than I needed, 2 large bathrooms.  4 - Concierge. It's been a while since I had such a spontaneous trip. Concierge service was very helpful to book a few activities for me and, to my surprise, the prices were the same as on TripAdvisor (if I'd book directly).  5 - Pool. Pools is great with warm water and lot's of recliners around it. You can get as many towels as you need with the pool concierge. I didn't get to use the pool much since I was looking for a quiet relaxing vacation, and the pool seems to be always occupied by lots of screaming children.  6 - Parking. I used the underground parking, which is situated directly under and between both tower buildings. Very convenient and I was always able to find a spot (it's first come, first serve). There is also lots of extra parking by the resort entrance.  7 - Room service. The cleaning ladies did a good job and my room was vacuumed, bathrooms - cleaned, dishes - put away, bed - made every day. There was a complimentary water and a pineapple in the fridge upon arrival.  8 - Laundry room. Each floor has a laundry room. It came in handy after the zip-lining trip when all my clothing and shoes were covered in red dust. There is a complimentary laundry detergent in the room. It worked just fine - no need to buy anything else.    The only hiccup happened during check-in. My room had an older type of lock. The lady at front desk kept sending me upstairs with the key she made and telling me I didn't use it right. It took me three trips on 10th floor and back. I had to take a photo of my door to show her that this type of key won't work. I saw another couple had the same issue that day with the same front desk lady. I was wondering if she just didn't want to think that half of the doors in the resort have old type of locks? I thought that was careless of her.    Overall, I enjoyed staying here.",Jul 2018,July 2018,Traveled solo,,"San Francisco, California"

597671130,50,The Whaler exceeds expectation,"The pictures you see of Aston at The Whaler don’t do this property justice. The gardens are beautifully manicured and the overall feeling is one of ‘Zen’.    We stayed on level 3, in tower two, and used the stairs rather than the lift (elevator). In doing so, we were no more than twenty steps away from the white sands of Kaanapali Beach.    We were welcomed with shell necklaces, and really appreciated the delivery of a complimentary pre-sliced pineapple to our condo. Thank you so much!    Our apartment was very roomy and light, the kitchen well equipped, and the over-sized shower a God-send.    The deck (lanai) was a good size, with two small tables and a lounger. We had a glorious view of the ocean front action, and also of the passing parade of holiday makers wandering into Whalers Village. It was easy to lose hours just soaking it all up.    Housekeeping did a great job and replenished supplies daily. The $20 resort fee covers the cost of parking, which I thought represented good value for money.    The pool area wasn’t as expansive or flashy as those in some of the other properties, but with crystal clear swimming in the ocean only steps from your door, why you’d choose to swim in chlorinated water is a mystery to me.    Thank you so much to all the staff who made our stay so amazing. Aloha!",Jul 2018,July 2018,Traveled with family,,New Zealand

594177607,40,A+ Location,"We hit the jackpot with the location as the Aston Whaler is located on Kaanapali Beach right next to Whaler's Village. We arrived early, but we weren't able to check-in yet. The front desk, however, stowed our luggage while we went food shopping. When we arrived back at the Whaler, it wasn't quite check-in time. Our room was ready, so they let us check in anyway. The bellman brought our luggage to our car to unload groceries and escorted my wife and daughter to the room.    During our stay, most of the hotel staff were helpful. There was one occasion, however, when it wasn't the case. I wasn't familiar with the towel policy, so I took my used towel to the front desk. The male front desk clerk motioned me to go around the corner without saying a word. I did as he asked and just stood there because I didn't really know what I was supposed to do. I could tell he was annoyed. He stopped doing ""nothing"" and showed me where to put the towels and handed me a towel card. I was put off by that experience. Other than that, everyone else was super helpful.    Our room number as 1016. It's a studio and was the perfect size for me, wife, and 10 yr old daughter. We were in the north tower (tower 1) and our room was facing black rock. The view was fantastic. I read on travel adviser to request a room in tower 1 above the 7th floor. The Aston Whaler was only too kind to accommodate.    The pool area looks small, but it accommodated all the guests who were there. There were plenty of chairs, and there was never a time I couldn't find seating. I love that they have cold water and ice tea available for all. In the morning, they even have coffee poolside. I thought it was a very nice touch.    The food on Maui is very expensive. For this reason, we stayed at the Whaler as every room has a full kitchen. We ate mainly breakfast there, but we also had lots of snacks: chips, ramen, fresh poke ready for our consumption.    Overall, a wonderful experience.

592907709,30,Depends on what you like...,"Here’s the thing about the Aston at the Whaler: the room was nice and clean and the staff was very friendly. So there’s nothing wrong with the hotel, per se; my issue is with the endless droves of tourists that fill the very small beach, the innumerable children running around the (tiny) pool like insects, the lack of drink or food service poolside or anywhere else on the property, and the commercialized feel that pervades the tourist trap that is Kaanapali.    By all means, if you traveled to Hawaii just to feel like you are in a Florida resort with name brand store shopping then go ahead - you will be very happy here. But if you want some semblance of an authentic Hawaii experience, then STAY AWAY at all costs. Kaanapali is a hellhole which we will never return to - we spent our entire time escaping to Lahaina, and we couldn’t be happier that we discovered such a cute beach town filled with many locals and great food.",Jul 2018,July 2018,Traveled as a couple,,

Make sure to partake in the pineapple iced tea. It's to die for! I wish we had the recipe.    The staff has really stepped it up. I feel like sometimes in the past, the staff acted like you were bothering them when checking in. Not anymore! The staff was very welcoming from the moment we arrived!  5 stars for that!    The grounds and pool are beautiful!    Our room, however, left a bit to be desired. I know The Whaler has minimum requirements for quality of the  accommodations. If the room we had (#415) meets those minimum requirements, then the minimum needs to be raised. If it doesn't meet them, then room 415 should not be used until it does. Either way, room 415 needs to have the bathroom renovated. It’s not that it's old (although that doesn't help), it's that it's run down. The door is rotting on the bottom edge. There is other evidence of water damage on the walls. Loads of caulking everwhere, obvious stopgap repairs.    We had some noise issues (sounded like someone dropping tools on a concrete floor) as well and talked to the front desk about it, but they couldn't figure out where it was coming from, I assume. They never followed up on that. In hindsight,  I think it may be the trash chute next to our room.    Next time, we will insist on a room that isn't near the elevators.

We booked a vacation package that included nine nights in a “premium” (I understand that to mean a room that has been remodeled. ) studio room, tower 2, room #1013, airfare, and Rental car-Alamo, through Costco, for 5K. Rooms here are condos that are individual owned and may also be obtained through VBRO. They all have full kitchens.    This property is older and some rooms have not been remodeled. Our room needed to replace the mattress. It was soft and very lumpy. Also, the appliances were older and there was a problem with the oven door not staying open in the broil cycle, so we had to leave it all the way open which took longer and changed the cooking time ! Compared to adjacent properties, The Westin, The Marriott, The Hyatt Regency, and The Sheraton this is a no frills basic property. Examples: grounds are basic, a no-frills pool, no pool bar, no restaurant, not sure about shuttle service, no entertainment, etc. There is a gated underground parking facility- with no extra fee, there is a daily resort fee, an older spa, a concierge, a patio with three gas BBQ’s (per tower) and a fire-pit at tower two, maid-service , public washer/dryers on each floor (some units have W/D in them). Koi feeding happens at 8:30 AM. There are bikes down in the garage-the only place to ride is on the very busy HWY 30, and shopping carts to bring the groceries from the car to the room.    There are two towers, 12 floors high, built perpendicular to the beach/ocean so all rooms have a side angled view of the beach ocean-West, and golf course- east, except the 2 bedroom end rooms that face the ocean-with wrap around decks. The best rooms are in tower one facing north, they have a sunset view. Second choice is tower two facing South with a golf course and side ocean view. Tower one with the southern facing views a Monday and Wed. Night Luau that is very loud. It looks down on the Whaler shopping facility. There are about 20, upright beach chairs available for guests at no charge but umbrellas, and lounge chairs cost extra ($45). SUP boards ($55 for two hours). There is a card exchange system for pool/beach towels. There is a public walking path from Black Rock (The Sheraton) to the state park however there are NO public bathrooms, except at Starbucks. Each facility requires guest cards for use.    Our condo, did not have kitchen condiments, other than salt and pepper and foil. Housekeeping supplied coffee and soaps/shampoos, toilet paper, hair dryer. Bring your own spices, ziplock bags, if you plan to do much cooking, etc. we had one Ziplock bag and a bit of foil. Also, bring a meat thermometer if you care. It was not in the condo.    There is an ABC connivence store right beside Tower one in the Whaler shopping area for quick things.

Staff were friendly and welcoming, the studio was perfect - spacious, spotless and extremely well appointed and a great pool area right next to the beautiful Kaanapali beach. Right next door is the Whalers Village with a handy selection of resort shops, food outlets and restaurants and an ABC of course. There is a Safeway supermarket and more shopping, bars and restaurants just a short $2 bus ride away in Lahaina.

582092710,50,Great experience,"I don’t write many reviews because of the time they take. I write if an establishment has really impressed me or there is something really wrong. This falls into the former. We were there between May 12 and May 20, 2018 (which is not whale watching season).    The Whaler generally: The location is great unless you are going to spend a lot of time on the eastern part of Maui. Many beaches to choose from, including a very nice one in front of the complex. Some of the catamaran tours pick up and begin right off the beach in front of the next door restaurant. The only downside is that West Maui is accessed by only one main road, on which there is some current construction, and that road did have a few travel back-ups between Lahaina and the east with 30 minute to 1 hour total delays while we were there.    Every interaction I had with the people of the Whaler was a good one. Very helpful front desk. We had small maintenance requests twice that were fixed promptly. They have a snorkel, body board, umbrella and chair rental special for five days for $99, with higher end snorkel equipment and fairly decent body boards, which allows you the flexibility to go to other beaches (we went to several, of which my favorite was Kapalua). We were there for more than five days, so they extended us an extra day without additional charge- typical of the extra mile this place will go for you.  The grounds are beautiful and well maintained. My wife even saw someone brooming the grass to clean off debris from the trees. There are two sets of three very nice outdoor gas grills you can use for cooking.    The final day we did not fly out until 10:30 pm. They will store luggage for you during the day, have showers in the bottom of tower 1, and will allow you to make use of the facilities until you leave, though you must check out of your room.  Elevators in Tower 2, where we stayed, were quick and efficient—we never had to wait long for an elevator.    Our room: We stayed in room 1161, which was an ocean view premium studio condo. Some booking sites do not make a distinction between a premium room and a standard room. The Aston site does, and can explain the difference. The premium ones are upgraded rooms. Room 1161 had a good bed, along with a modern kitchen with granite countertops and great appliances which was well stocked for cooking, as well as a very nice bathroom and shower area. It had a nice view of the beach and water from the covered balcony, which had a nice table for eating, making it enjoyable for breakfast or reading. Housekeeping was excellent, but we did tip each day. The studio was perfect for us, as a couple, but I wouldn’t recommend any more than two in the unit.    The downsides arose from the fact that this room was in Tower 2, which on the outside faces Whaler Village, a nice group of stores and restaurants. However, being next to a small mall does mean you are subject to the sound of air conditioners and the like which accompany the mall. Not overwhelming, but steady low level background noise. Perhaps the bigger downside was that there was frequently the smell of wood smoke (though not visible) which I assume came from one of the nearby restaurants. It was not an unpleasant smell, but sometimes it did get tiresome and we frequently kept the doors to the balcony closed so that our room would not be subject to the smell. Neither of these two problems were deal breakers. I expect that these two issues would affect many of the ocean view rooms in Tower 2, so you may try to request rooms in Tower 1, or a room in Tower 2 facing the lovely grounds. The Tower 1 out-facing rooms would face another resort. If I were to do it again (and I would definitely go to the Whaler again), I would ask for a premium ocean view studio room in Tower 1.

The well kept immaculate grounds were impressive along with the friendliness of the pool guys - who were also very helpful. I can't say enough good about this lovely place - even down to our maid service - they did a great job too! Having a kitchen made a big difference for us because we ate around the area in Whaler Village & at The Westin & I must say that I was not that impressed at all by the very expensive food at those places & it really wasn't all that good so having a kitchen meant alot! I thoroughly enjoyed my stay with you all & the whole area where there seems to be something for everyone from all the different activities available to ....if you want beach, sand, grass even, sun or shade, pool chairs, beach chairs, cabanas - you name it - it's available!

572312915,50,Wonderful Stay,"My husband and I stayed in room 663 ocean view premium studio the last week of March. The view of the ocean from the balcony was gorgeous. The balcony itself was quite large with one lounge chair, a medium sized table, and a few regular chairs as well. We had a king size bed, small couch, large dining table with a few chairs, and a small desk. Everything was laid out great, felt very spacious, and perhaps recently updated. The kitchen area was nice and equipped with any pans, bowls, silverware, glasses, etc. that you would need. There was a walk-in closet next to the bathroom so we could hang our clothes and put away the luggage for the whole week, which made the room feel even more spacious. My brother-in-law was staying a few feet down at the Westin hotel and he thought our studio was much larger and nicer than this hotel room.    The location is perfect, right on the beach. It is next door to Whaler Village with an ABC store where you can pick up alcohol, amenities, and snacks, many clothing stores, and some great restaurants. We purchased coffee from the island vintage coffee, a yummy sandwich from Nikki’s and a delicious, shrimp and avocado omelet from Joey’s. We ate lunch at Leilani’s which was great. We had dinner twice and ended up at the bar at Monkeypod quite a few times. The food and cocktails there are amazing, probably our favorite place we ate at. We also enjoyed the food one evening at the Hula Grill dining room. Honestly, so many fabulous food options within a minute walk, you will not miss that there is no restaurant at Aston Whaler. Plus, you have a full size fridge and you could get plenty of drinks and snacks at the ABC store. Or, at the first stop on the bus that goes to Lahaina is a Safeway grocery store, if you fully want to stock up and cook in your room. We also walked over to Roy’s one night for dinner which is on the golf course about a half mile or so behind The Whaler. It was a nice walk and the food there was exquisite.    The pool is on the smaller size, but we never had a problem getting chairs when we wanted pool time. Plus, the beach is in front of the building, and there is always room in the sand for your towel. And you can rent chairs on the beach if you want to.    The beach walkway is great. You can walk about two miles in both directions for exercise, or just to check out the hotels and restaurants that line the boardwalk. It is very convenient and felt safe at any time, day or night.    If you do not plan to do much sight seeing of different parts of the island, you really wouldn’t need a car. This area is a gorgeous stretch of ocean and beach that would keep you plenty occupied for a week. Black Rock beach is an easy walk down the beach for great snorkeling. And the $4 round trip bus takes you from Whaler’s Village to Lahaina for any fishing charters, submarine rides, trips over to Lanai, more restaurants , etc. My husband went out fishing with Fuzzy, which is Die Hard charters. They caught immense amounts of ahi tuna and mahi mahi. He was exhausted, but had an absolute blast.    I had a massage at the spa at The Whaler. I forget the masseuse’s name, but he did a wonderful job and the service/ambience at the spa was very nice. I used the workout facility almost every day. It was clean and well maintained with treadmills, bikes, ellipticals, weights, machines, etc.    We had daily maid service and she did a wonderful job, and was also a very nice person. A fresh coffee package and bath amenities were given to us each day. The lobby had complimentary coffee in the morning and tea and water in the afternoon (as well as by the pool), which I thought was a nice touch. We were given one laundry detergent as well. The free laundry was located in the hall by the elevators, which was also a nice amenity that we utilized. We never used the outside grill area, but they kept it immaculately clean and if we weren’t so busy trying all the area restaurants, we may have used it.    Overall, this was an absolutely wonderful place to stay. We would definitely stay here again, and would highly recommend it to anyone.

It made it so convenient for getting ready after swimming. The kitchen and front room were a nice addition, although our kitchen had no pans for baking other than a bundt pan. That seemed kind of weird. Apparently we could have asked the maid and she would have gotten us one.    The whaler seems to attract the older crowd which was great for us as we are retired. No kids screaming down the halls, you aren't getting hit by a football as you cross the grass. We love kids in fact we have 6 of them, but I wouldnt say this is geared towards children.    The beach was so easily accessible. We paid a lot of money to go snorkeling at Molokini, the snorkeling was better out on the beach. Head towards black rock, just a 5 minute walk away and there is fabulous snorkeling with a wide variety of fish and even a large turtle that hangs out there. . Just make sure that if there are kids jumping off the black rock, you are out of there way.    I would definitely recommend staying here again. In fact we even looked at purchasing a place, but it was a tad bit pricey.

From the time you go thru the inviting entrance and the security gates.... until you leave.......you'll be in love with The Whaler and never want to visit anywhere else on Maui.  Everything you need is right here.  Beautiful beautiful uncluttered grounds.  We found so many of the resorts on Kaanapali have so much landscaping and trees in their courtyards and around the resort it blocks the view of the ocean.  Why be here if you can see or be ocean front? Isn't that why we're all here?  The Whaler has incredible views from every condo .  Two buildings each with 12 floors and an incredible courtyard dividing them. A Koi pond that's irregular in shape with a natural wood bridge provides a wonderful photo opportunity. The Koi so interesting, lots of different colors and sizes. The grounds are perfectly maintained and a young man named Ely keeps the pond tip top shape and the fish very happy. As you register in the lobby you'll find another beautiful photo op. The incredibly friendly and professional receptionists begin your stay in paradise.  Also there are concierges that are very helpful if you need assistance planning activities, answering any questions about restaurants, LUAU's, hiking or anything you may be interested in.  The condos belong to personal owners that you can rent thru the Aston, VRBO, Home Away from Home and several more sites. Each condo is fully stocked and providing comfort for you time away from home.  There is parking on site, a $20.00 a day resort fee ( which is much less than others ) use of beach chairs, beach towels and washers and dryers.  Also available is valet parking if you prefer as well as Bell Men to help you to you condo. There's also an on-site SPA, a GYM and BBQ's for your use ....during certain times of the year movie nights for kids in the lobby, April 1st, East Day an upcoming Easter Egg Hunt ( look for the golden egg ) for a special prize. The hunt is done by age groups. Next door to The Whaler is Whalers Village. Full of shops, restaurants , a food court for more casual eating...too many places to name.  Who needs an on-site restaurant when we have full kitchens and The Village only a couple of hundred feet away.  Also, enjoy 3 miles of beautiful white sand beach for runner, walkers or just strolling in paradise. A good place for a wedding too!!!  And the sunsets....there aren't words.....the most incredible sunsets even if it's cloudy or overcast.

567144803,50,This location is CENTRAL Ka'anapali Beach. Loved it. Will be back,"I love whale watching and a naturalist on a cruise I went on mentioned that Ka’anapali in February was the best time to go and see whales wintering over near Maui so I chose Kaanapali for our base when we went to Hawaii this March.    Just want to clarify one thing that confused me, on TA, the Aston Whaler is listed under both Kaanapali Beach hotels and also under Lahaina hotels. Kaanapali Beach is the beach resort area near the town of Lahaina where there are a lot of eateries, the, bus hub and Front St the wonderful street to visit for shopping and eating. Kaanapali Beach area is about a 15-20 minute bus ride from Lahaina township.    High rating is due to central location and well maintained building plus value:  Selected Aston at The Whaler because of it’s TA rating at no 5 and it’s central location next to the Whalers village. Stayed in a one bedroom 2 bath condo in Tower 2, the south tower with courtyard view. Unit 1160. Booked it via the Aston hotel website. Condo was huge must have been 1400 sq ft with great view from balcony to the sea and Black Rock. Cost was $430++. This is not a cheap area to vacation at. Dec-March is the high season in this area as many americans come over from the mainland to vacation and get away from the winter weather and also the whales are in town, so to speak ☺.    I loved it. Condo was not new but very clean and tidy. One thing that struck me about the Aston is that there are very long standing employees like Fred on concierge. And they clearly love their jobs and their pride in working at the hotel is palpable. All credit to them. It's not the most lavish resort but I actually liked the simpleness of the property and also the lack of kids at the hotel - as mine are off my hands now LOL.    Location:  The Whaler suited our travel style as we like to stay centrally, get out and about, use public transport and also be in the most central location we can wherever we go. The Aston is near the fabulous Whaler Village which is an upmarket village with quite a few very nice stores and eateries. It’s not a small village like you’d expect if you are from outside the States. It’s quite a decent shopping area, and you are hearing this from an avid shopper.    Getting to Lahaina from the Whaler:  From the Whaler Village entrance, the Maui Bus leaves to Lahaina every 7 minutes past the hour. (see my pic of the timetable outside the Whaler Village). From there you can go to lots of parts of West Maui. Tip- It’s $2 for any trip. And an all day pass costs $4 so get the all day pass straight away when u get on the bus. (Cash, correct change only) make sure you check with the driver that it’s going to Lahaina not Kapalua. Also don’t get confused with the trolley bus that shuttles guests to the Kanaapali Beach hotels from the Whaler Village.    The price we paid for our stay, although expensive, was much better value than a room at some of the mega resorts down the boardwalk. Where I surmise a lot of your room rate would be going towards the facilities. The Whaler is a very well kept retro, almost hip, 70s building. The best units are looking into the courtyard garden area. The least desirable would be the tower 2 units backing on to the Whaler village and Hula Grill restaurant next door where the air con unit and cooking smells detract from a peaceful seat on your balcony. Do your homework as there are Whaler building plans on the net.    There are units in the the Whaler available via the Aston site or direct through owners. Getting one through Aston would guarantee a certain standard of room and daily servicing. Especially the Aston ‘premium’ condos which are guaranteed renovated rooms. I read some rather variable reports in TA of stays in unrenovated units. These would be ones not booked via Aston as premium rooms.    I loved this location. It is 'grand central railway station' of Kaanapali with Whaler’s Village and the Maui bus stop next door. You wouldn’t need a car as we didn’t. There is an ABC store (general marts they have in Hawaii, where you can get your supplies for breakfast etc), or else you could also catch an uber down to the Safeway which is only a 5-7 minute driveaway.    We are definitely going back to this property.    Recommendations:  Trilogy whale watch 2 hour cat cruise is great. Book at least a couple of days ahead. Morning tours are best I think. Leaves from Kaanapali beach.    For cheaper meals and great shopping go on the no 28 bus to Front st, Lahaina.    Go for a courtyard view room definitely. Forwards is better.    Monkey Pod restaurant in the Whaler Village has happy hour from 3-530pm when appetisers are 50% off. Don’t go though at 5.20pm as there was often a queue and if you get in too late you won’t get the discount.    Catch the Mokulele airlines 40 min flight from HNL to Kapalua airport. It’s in an 8 seater! 45 minute ride in an 8 seater plane. Great views. Taxi from Kapalua airport to the Whaler was $17 plus tip and uber back was $11.    In summary, I LOVED this area and the Whaler.

The bathroom amenities were high end and the separate sink area made it easier to share the space. There is complimentary laundry (they even provided detergent!), which helped us travel light (a bonus when taking the inter island flights.

We overlooked the the shopping village and ocean. Unfortunately we couldn't really hear the ocean at night for the sound of the shops/restaurants A/C unit noise. Nicely appointed unit had everything we needed. The staff of Princess, Mimi, Fred and Cheri were all very helpful. The unit was a little pricier than we had hoped and more than we paid last time we were in Maui.

557031437,50,Very good alternative to a hotel,"We had a premium condo, no 619, and it was perfect in every way. Free wifi that actually works and you do not have to log in every time you want to use it, good beds, plenty storage space for clothes etc and even washing machine and dryer. And a massive TV and sound system if you are into that. The housekeeping staff are extremely helpful and flexible, they even took care of some rather bulky items we wanted to get rid of. For the price of a modest hotel suite we find this much better and more convenient. We have been there before and will probably stay there again. Some tips though: You really do get better rooms when paying the extra for premium (we had friends and relatives in other rooms, which were also very nice, but ours had that little extra). Tower A is better than B if you want to be on the sunny side, as the latter has that side towards the shopping center. One side of the towers has sun all day, as the a/c is excellent we feel that this is the best side, others may wish to be in the shade. All units above 3rd floor have nice views over the mountains and the ocean.",Jan 2018,January 2018,Traveled with friends,The south side of tower B overlooks a busy (and noisy) shopping center and restaurants.,"Trondheim, Norway"
556755296,50,GREAT CONDO!!!,"First off be aware if you use GPS.. Our took us right to the Whaler shopping center next door. By the time we realized it we had to enter the pay parking lot. I called the Aston and they were very helpful and said to tell the gate clerk and they wouldnt make us pay which they gladly did! Tried to check in around 2:30. The condo was not ready yet as it was early but the valet got all our luggage and after a very smooth check in the front desk said they would call us as I told her we were gonna walk next door to the Hula Girl restaurant for lunch anyway.    We got into our condo around 4pm and it was awesome. The balcony (lanai) was the BIGGEST I have ever had anywhere in my travels. We got a 2 bedroom premium ocean front condo. It was room 402 and it cost rounghly $8500 for 8 nights. Nice sized kitchen and living room and dinning room. The master bedroom was huge and had a full bath room in it with access to the lanai through sliders that almost opened the length of the room. The second bedroom also had lanai access. There were two lower tables with chairs on the side part and a higher table with chairs on the ocean front part with a lounger. We sat out there so much spotting many many Humpback Whales as they went by.    The pool was good temp and there were a lot of seats. They do fill up people were always leaving so we didnt wait long to get 4 seats. They offer free ice water and a fruity iced tea poolside that hit the spot. The property is easy walking to Black Rock (although as a snorkel spot I would not recommend it as it is murky..go to Molokini Crater instead). It is also right next to the Whaler shopping center with shops, places to eat and an ABC store that has good quick bite food items and tourist stuff and flip flops and clothes, etc....    Parking was easy. Free valet when we were there. We also parked ourselves sometimes. It is underground directly under the buildings. IF it is off hours, you will have to wait for security guard to get the car. But they were fast and the front desk lady told them we were headed to an early morning tour and he got our car quickly.    They have a number of grills that you can use and a large eating area outside oceanside. I called for help as I couldnt get the grill on and within 2 minutes two young men came over to help us.    We never had any problems with the property, the condo, the pool, the staff or the location. I highly recommend. Oh on check in day, a staff member brought us a freshly sliced local pineapple, coffee, two coffee cups and some carmel nut popcorn as a gift. That was nice. Oh and we NEVER heard the neighbors as the sound proofing seemed like it was solid concrete. We did 4 tours from the Lahaina Harbor which took 15-20 minutes to drive to. There is close grocery stores, stores, places to eat, mcdonalds, local places and a great farmers market    I highly recommend this property.",Jan 2018,January 2018,Traveled with family,,"Wytheville, Virginia"
556201691,50,Great location,"Stayed here for 6 night spending the rest of our time on the island in Paia and one night in Hana. This is a great location. It's along a nice stretch of beach further down towards the Hyatt the beach is very short with no place to lay on the sand, not the case in font of this hotel. It is a short walk to the black rock where you can snorkel. There is also a few restaurant alongside the beach path that you can walk to. It's a 5-10 minute drive ( or you can take the bus from the whaler village next door) to lahaina where there are many shops and restaurants.  We stayed in a condo through VRBO. There was a couch, table chairs and a small kitchen. Bed was very comfortable. The balcony was amazing we were able to see the ocean in one direction and the mountains in the other. They also provide beach towels.

554314362,50,I'm not sure how you could do better than this!,"Where to start? Pulled up and the valet was dancing and laughing and we immediately felt at home. She was enjoying life and turned out to be extraordinarily helpful, which I found was a common theme with every one of the staff members we encountered. Down to a person they were helpful, courteous, and professional.    This is a condo complex and many of the units are individually owned. We talked for a bit with one of the owners in the lobby and even she was awesome! We ended up in an Ocean View Premium Studio room. Updated stainless steel appliances, granite countertops, and stone tile floors and shower. This unit had a full service kitchen with drawers full of utensils that you'd need to prepare almost any meal. We walked out onto the private Lanai and BAM!, there's the island of Molokai off in the distance. Gorgeous! The complex is extraordinarily (I'll be using this word a lot) clean and quiet. I can't say for sure but it seems to cater to older couples? It's perfectly positioned in relation to both the ocean and nearby restaurants and shops. It's situated right next to The Whaler's Mall which has every conceivable thing you could imagine from GoPro cameras to sunscreen. Need a Rolex? You can get one here. Hop in your car and you're a 2 mile drive from grocery stores, gas stations, more restaurants etc... And the housekeepers? Alice from The Brady Bunch would be jealous! We came in one afternoon and found a handwritten note from the housekeeper wishing us a good day! (Thanks Veronica) They were all very attentive and extraordinarily (there it is again) professional.    This complex is on the south end of Ka'anapali Beach which puts you in a great overall location for the backside drive and the Road to Hana.

I had booked a private 2 bedroom condo (902) through a 3rd party vacation rental company but as it turned out we arrived to find out that the rental was a scam. Jason was on duty at the front desk and he was sympathetic and helpful.Keeping in mind that the island was 96% booked up for the Christmas holidays, he was able to find a room on site for our family of 4. It was only a 1 bedroom but he informed me that he would keep an eye out for a 2 bedroom. Within 2 days Jason's associate was able to find us a 2 bedroom.

549812148,40,Clean & Comfortable Stay at the Aston,"Overall this place exceeded my expectations! We were in room 413 which was very clean and spacious considering it was a bachelor suite. I believe a common misconception about this place is that people think all the rooms are similar, however they can be completely different. When you're scoping out this place, see if you can find pictures of your exact room.    Upon arrival, management was very friendly and they delivered a signature Hawaiian fresh cut pineapple to our room as a greeting. The room was immaculate and offered a great ocean view. The room came with a mini kitchen with all the essentials (fridge, oven, stove, sink, dishwasher) as well as a walk in closet. The pool was a little small (but very clean and well-kept) however we didn't bother to go in it because the beach was beautiful and was just as close.    If you're looking for a beachfront place around many restaurants and activities all at an affordable price compared to other hotels/condos in the area, I would definitely recommend this place!! If you're travelling as a family with small children, I don't think I would recommend this place as I believe there are more children-oriented activities and pools at other hotels in Ka'anapali. If you're traveling as a couple or with older kids in their teens or twenties I believe this is a great place to stay for the money we paid.

The Whales were just coming back from Alaska, wow, great shows right from the Lanai of our unit. Tower 2 facing north (even numbers) gives the best views of Black Rock which is magical and the Pacific ocean, all of the units give views of the mountains and the ocean to some extent, but the odd numbers in tower 2 face the Whalers village and don't give the view of Black Rock. While Tower 1 on the south side is in the sun all afternoon, and has no view of Black Rock, but does give you a view of the pool. The north side of Tower 1 gives you the view of Black Rock, but not of the courtyard and pool like the north side of tower 2.    Tower 2 rocks! Our condo was great, love the views....

The lanai wraps from the side of the unit around to the front and is furnished with tables, chairs and loungers. Great place for breakfasts and afternoon drinks.  The staff has been friendly and helpful. The pool is small but the ocean front location, furnishings and refreshments make it a great place to enjoy the sun or read under an umbrella if there are rain showers.  We were surprised that there was no welcome package with coffee, creamer, sugar etc in the unit when we checked in and we did not receive a complimentary mid-week tidy up. These are things that we have received in all of the other time shares we have traded into. Not really a problem as there are only two of us so not much mess to deal with.  The only improvement we would suggest is that the unit needs better lighting in the bedrooms and living area. It is very dim in both these areas making it difficult to sit and read in the evening.

543878299,40,Great Vacation - how could you not?!,"We are not even back a week and already miss Maui so much. It was our 2nd Visit to the same area - Kaanapali - but where we previously stayed in the Royal Lahaina, this time we chose the Whaler.    We were a little skeptical about the type of unit that we would get since we knew that these were Condo’s of all different types, but we needn’t have worried. We were given a studio (ocean view as requested) on the 7th floor - 713 - and we loved it. The view was spectacular!! Overlooking the Koi Carp pond and the ocean...it was a dream listening to the ocean at night! I loved it. The unit itself was just a little dated but it was homely. We particularly loved the Golfy references since that is our background; the comfy Murphy bed which was huge!!! And the massive fridge with the Ice Maker which was so well used! The bathroom could do with updating as it is looking really dated and a little dinghy. The bathroom sink let’s put a real sewer reek when you run the tap in the morning. Housekeeping were brilliant but I would say that the timings were a bit sporadic. Sometimes we would be made up by 12pm and other it was closer to 5pm and I am not entirely sure why. Also, we had chocolates and flowers left on the bed on our last night but at no other time. The pineapple and coffee on arrival was a welcome treat though!    We used the free parking which was much appreciated (big aloha’s to the guys on the entrance hut - they were always so cheery!) and the pool and beach many times. Michael and Steph on the Beach/Pool Hale were lovely and we feel quite bad as we have no idea if we were supposed to tip them and if so, how much/frequently which did make us feel awkward at times. We did make use of the $65 beach cabana twice but were reluctant to do so much more because we considered this price to be so so expensive!    We would have given the Hotel 5 stars but there were 2 areas that we feel they fell down:    1. late Check out. lord this was frustrating. Asked a few days before check out what the procedure was and we were told to Enquiries 48 hours before check out if this would be possible but we were told that at that moment the room wasn’t booked following our check out so that looked positive    We checked again 48 hours before check out but were told to check again the next day (but that the room was still free)    We checked the next day and were told the same again - check the next day and the room was still free    So we did the same again and were told that we couldn’t have the room any longer than until 12pm on the day of check out. Considering we had been told the room was free and really not looking forward to checking out at 12pm for a 10pm flight we were understandably upset and decided to ask again that night. When we asked that night we were told it should be fine but to ask again in the morning (so morning of check out now!) which we did. We were told we could have the room until 1pm - we literally had to look to rebook another room for reception to finally say - Oh ok yeah you can pay for late check out...which is literally what we had been wanting to do from the very beginning. We were charged $200 for keeping the room and extra 4.5 hours. Which was worth it for us to have a little R&R and hot shower prior to our 18 hours of flights. It’s just a bit steep!  The whole debacle was frustrating and frankly unnecessary and did cause frustration and upset.    And finally, we watched unit owners arrive for thanksgiving on various days in our time there and witnessed the staff fawning over them. They treated them like royalty and literally couldn’t do enough for them. I get it, they spend a TON of money to live there a few times a year but treat everyone the same as we are guests too. Help us with our luggage and make chit chat with us, offer us cookies etc. it’s a really little thing but there didn’t seem to be the same Aloha spirit for us that we experienced in other accommodation on this island.

Unfortunately it was extremely during the time we were there, so we weren't able to use the balcony much.

541865613,40,Wonderful stay!,"We picked the Whaler because of its location to Whaler's Village. It was our daughter's 21st birthday and we wanted to have choices for restaurants and fun cocktails! It didn't disappoint! We stayed in a fabulous 2 bedroom condo in tower 1 in unit 623 that was super clean and updated. It truly felt like home away from home. The master bed was not super comfy but listening to the ocean waves crashing was perfect for sleeping. The master bath was big and wonderful but the guest bath had a huge step to get in the shower/tub combo which wouldn't work for everyone. The beach shack had plenty of chairs and items to rent. We rented everything we needed for the entire week and it was handy to take everything with us daily. The snorkeling was fabulous at the end of the beach by the Sheraton. The concierge staff was really helpful in getting reservations for us for meals and activities. The only down-side was that there was a lot of construction going on at the Whaler and near-by properties so there was always construction noise. All in all, it was a great week and we look forward to returning!",Nov 2017,November 2017,Traveled with family,,"Lodi, California"
541214414,30,Pretty mediocre,"Not sure about the rest of the rooms but we are in 1014 in Tower 1and pretty disappointing to be honest. We booked this as a 5 star Ocean view suite and it is definitely Ocean view but the main view is of the roof of the building next door, pretty hideous really but if you can somehow ignore that then the ocean looks and sounds very nice. This is why I gave it a 3 star rating. Without that I would likely go with 2. Room is quite dingy, bathroom is very dirty with grunge buildup in all of the corners and smells like urine, bathtub does not drain very well likely contributing to the smell. Kitchen area is ok i guess but is in need of some updating thats for sure. Bed was comfortable which is a plus and sound of the surf is wonderful, sunset is on the other side of building though so another letdown. We have stayed in other condos along this stretch of beach and this one is the least impressive so far. Staff are very nice and tried to get us into another unit but they were about the same For the price we paid for this unit, about $350 per night, it certainly fails to meet expectations.

539449365,50,Best Vacation at a Beauttiful Condo!!!,"My husband and I absolutely loved our stay at The Aston at the Whaler in Kaanapali Beach. It was our first time to Maui, so we had no idea where to stay. I searched online at difference places and was drawn to the Aston because it had a full kitchen, was reasonably priced and had positive reviews. From the time we pulled up to the day we left, we were soooo incredibly pleased with the Aston and were already planning our next vacation before we left. We stayed in the Premium Ocean View Suite and they actually gave us a complimentary upgrade when we arrived to a larger room with separate living area and separate bedroom. The room was so large and spacious, we loved the upgraded kitchen and bathroom. The bed was comfortable and everything was very clean. The rooms had ceiling fans which were very nice too. Not to mention the amazing ocean views from the room! We ate breakfast everyday out on our lanai looking at the ocean. The staff and concierges were very friendly and helpful. Everyday we had new towels and a clean room from housekeeping! The location is amazing and steps to the beautiful beach. I am so glad we stayed here because the beach was awesome. We were going to stay at the Hyatt at Kaanapali Beach but am so glad we didn't because we went to visit the Hyatt one day and enjoy their grotto bar and coulndn't believe how little amount of sandy beach they had at their property. So glad we went with Aston and will definitely stay again and recommend to anyone looking.

We were on the 5th floor tower 1  Great location, close to whaler village where we ate at some nice restaurants. Beach is directly accessible from this property but a short walk north sees you at black rock beach which is good for snorkeling and a little more protected. The pool is small but serves the purpose - if you are looking for a hotel which has a pool bar then this is not the place for you.  Free parking, wifi and beach towels with $20 a day resort fee.  Nice little gym as well on the lower level as well as a spa which we had a massage at - this is not cheap though but convenience of just downstairs is good.  The staff were friendly and helpful and the grounds were kept immaculately by the grounds staff. We noticed other hotel grounds not nearly as well kept.  There is some construction work being done currently, mostly on level 1 in tower 1. I think some updating. Didn’t really bother us too much.  Only negative I would have to mention is the cost of phone charges. We made 2-3 local calls and our phone charges came to $40-$50US. I questioned this on check out but wasn’t met with much empathy and at 6am and a flight to catch I wasn’t in a position to stand and argue. There were also 2 calls on the day we arrived which we didn’t make. Advice: don’t use the internal phone use your mobile and check the bill to make sure no calls have been added to your bill.

538329707,30,Pricy for the conto to stay in Kaanapali Beach,"The Whalers used to be a reasonably priced condo at the Kaanapali Beach, and with its full kitchen priveleges, its main attraction was price & convenience. However, ever since Marriott Chain has bought the neighboring Westin Hotel & Sheraton Hotel (Starwood Hotel Chain) on the Kaanapali Beach, Marriott has jacked up all its hotel pricing, and The Whalers followed the pricing move. While the southern part of the Kaanapali Beach is nice, northern part of the Kaanapali Beaches are pretty good, and attractiveness of Kaanapali Beach, south of Black Rock may be losing its appeal due to high pricing. If you want to stay south of Black Rock, and wish to cook on your own food, you have either The Whalers or Kaanapali Ali to choose condo from. Kaanapali Ali features all 1 or 2 bedroom units whereas The Whalers has Studio unit, as well. The Whalers does NOT allow pets whereas Kaanapali Ali allows pets.

Every day we were treated to beautiful rainbows.    The location couldn’t have been better. The Whaler Village is located centrally on the beach between Black Rock and Lahaina. Restaurants are nearby as well as shopping. The beach offers snorkeling and all water sports but at times can be a bit wavy. At those times the area near Black Rock is the calmest.    Groceries are best purchased in Kahului near the airport after you land at Costco for the best prices but we shopped at Foodland and Safeway for our supplies in Lahaina. Prices were obviously more than on the mainland but not exorbitantly so.    The restaurants were expensive like most resort areas but a cheap meal could be found in the mall food court at Nikki’s Pizza for $5.    As far as the condo, nothing was lacking. The place was very clean, the people were great and the condo was beautiful.

530072055,30,truly mixed bag for us,"positives first:    - excellent location on the beach  - service staff (housekeeping, bell, pool/beach-side staff, etc) do a super job and are efficient and friendly  - I feel that after remodeling is done, hopefully about 75% of the rooms will be awesome  - GM did try his best effort to alleviate issues noted below (but it was still far from ideal)    negatives:    - we booked direct with Aston and there is no reason for them not to disclose that a very large number of rooms and floors are undergoing remodeling. had we known this we would not have taken the chance (many other hotels/vacation apartment do disclose such info prominently on booking page) The noise/disturbance was just unacceptable. we came for a holiday of peace and quiet and unfortunately found the constant drilling and hammering stressful. GM did change our first room to one which was on a much higher floor, but unfortunately there was remodeling going on near this room as well. To his credit, GM provided a small courtesy credit to our final bill to compensate (that doesn't do much to console other family members though...)    - unfortunately, even after remodeling is complete, up to 20-25% of the roomswill not have much peace and quiet. These are the rooms facing Whaler village, During our more than 1 week stay (about half on lower floor and half on higher floor), we noticed a constant ""industrial"" sound, or should I say downright industrial nuisance (machinery, trucks, heavy load HVAC systems humming from the shops and restaurants of the Village) coming from the Whaler Village area. so if you are assigned a room that faces the Whaler Village, be prepared for those kind of sounds. It can be reduced somewhat (not completely) by keeping the balcony door closed but if you want to enjoy the views and winds then no getting away from it. If you are a light sleeper and get easily disturbed by industrial sounds .... be sure you are not allocated a room on this side of the property.    - bed/mattress quality in both our rooms were poor. the staff did change mattress in first room .. by the time we got to 2nd room I gave up on complaints and just tried to enjoy rest of our vacation........hopefully this is addressed in remodeled rooms.    - first room had really bad smoker smell! or some kind of funky smell...2nd room did not have smell, once again - mixed bag overall.",Oct 2017,September 2017,Traveled with family,request a room in the tower away from Whaler Village,"Great Falls, Virginia"
527344487,30,Great Location and Friendly Staff,"The staff at the Whaler are very nice and accommodating. The property is beautiful and we didn't need to go far to do what we wanted to do. Most days, we didn't even have to get into our car. Our kids loved the beach right by the property and the pool, and also enjoyed feeding the koi in the morning. However, the most disappointing part of our trip was our room, hence the 3 star rating. Granted, we booked through an external property management company (not the Whaler) so we don't know who exactly is to blame, but a week before our arrival, we receive a call from the property management company that the room we booked months in advance (booked January 2017 for an August 2017 trip) and prepaid for will not be available during our stay due to a remodel on the floor. We were given the option to stay at another property they (external property management) had available, cancel and get a refund and find another place on our own, or accept a room the Whaler had available. Option 1 was out because it didn't look too family friendly and was not as convenient location-wise. Cancelling was also out because hello... our trip was one week away! We did not need that additional stress right before a vacation. So we were left with the final option of accepting the available room the Whaler offered, yet we weren't told what room it was. We didn't know if it was some corner room with no windows or if it was equivalent to the room we had originally booked, which was on the 10th floor with gorgeous views (one of the reasons we booked the room in the first place). We were nervous, but what other option did we have? So come our day of arrival... after a VERY long day of traveling (from Seattle) that included delays and an extra leg on our itinerary, and two very cranky kids, we arrive at the Whaler and get checked in. We get a room on the 4th floor (room 469). Not as high up, but okay, fine. We get in the room, which had a very weird smell and only peek-a-boo views. Not what we were expecting. You'd think they'd try to get you into an equivalent room or better since they kicked us out of our originally booked room one week before we arrived. But no. We were so disappointed with it because it was NOWHERE near the room we had booked that we went back down and talked to the guy at the front desk, Dexter. We explained the situation to him and he tried his best to help us out. He ended up getting us in to a premium room on the 2nd floor that was available for a few days. So we stayed there for the first few days of our trip and soaked in the views and returned to room 469 with the peek-a-boo view for the rest of our trip, which still had a strange smell that we could not figure out. We ended up leaving the sliding doors to the balcony open to air out the room, which helped a little. Luckily, we didn't really stay in the room much so we dealt with it. The external property management company also threw in the daily resort fee to compensate for our trouble, but we would've rather paid the resort fee to have stayed in an equivalent room. All in all, we were happy with our stay due to the friendly staff and location, but not happy with what happened with our room. I mean, I'm sure there was some sort of schedule for said remodel, so why were we not notified in advance? Per the external property management company, the Whaler was notifying the old owners of the unit and that's why the notice was so late. I call BS on that... how do you not know who the current owner of a unit is? Again, I'm not sure who to blame for the mix up since I booked through an external property management company. I just wanted to share my experience.

521970134,30,Beautiful property/big disappointment,"The Whaler is a beautiful property, wonderfully located directly on Kaanapali beach. The staff is friendly and accommodating to the extent that they can be. We have stayed here at least 4 or 5 times, having a terrific experience each time. We always pay extra for a premium unit with an ocean view and request a high floor as well. We have always been happy. This trip, however, was different. We were given a lovely premium unit (upgraded furniture/kitchen/bathroom). The unit itself was gorgeous. While we never expect perfection, there were several issues that substantially interfered with our enjoyment. (1) No hot water. In order to get hot water into our unit it was necessary to turn on all of the hot water in the all of the sinks, showers and tubs and let them run for about 5 minutes. After several minutes the water would warm up and eventually become hot enough to take a shower or to wash our hands. Whaler maintenance and management explained that the problem was not fixable. It was due to the way the plumbing in the building was installed. (2) Construction noise. We had been warned that there might be some construction noise emanating from work being done at nearby Whaler's Village. That noise turned out to be non-existent. Instead, they neglected to tell us that there was substantial construction being done on the 10th and 11th floors in our building, or that there was a construction project underway DIRECTLY ABOVE OUR UNIT. We endured drill hammering, banging and sawing noise throughout our stay. When we complained and asked to be moved to another comparable unit, we were told that would not be possible.(3) Ocean view. Yes there was a sliver of an ocean view if you went out onto the lanai. But the ""ocean view"" aspect was a major overstatement and a bit of a disappointment, especially considering that we paid extra for an ocean view unit. There wasn't really an ocean view from anywhere inside the one bedroom condominium unless you were directly against the glass slider in the living room. Calling this an ""ocean view"" unit worth more money is just plain dishonest.

They also offer so much more; things we never used-i.e. Tennis courts, golfing, excercise facilities, and more. Each floor also had a washer and dryer available free to guest. House keeping couldn't have better, and the entire staff at this resort was always very friendly, and helpful. We also had rented a car while on Maui, and this resort offers FREE parking to their guest. The Whaler is located just a very short drive to Lahaina and all of the wonderful little shops there, and also close to a couple of grocery stores. We had an incredibly great stay at the Aston at The Whaler on Kaanapali Beach! This was our first trip to Maui; it was a special occasion, and ""The Whaler"" added to that. I'm sure that I'm leaving something more out of this review; and if I am, I'm also sure that it was something good. If we make it back to Maui, we'll be back at The Whaler. Very highly recommend this Resort.",Aug 2017,August 2017,,,"Peoria, Arizona"

517758256,50,Home Away From Home,"Our travel agent recommended the Whaler for the 5 nights in Maui based upon the fact that our group consisted of 3 people - myself ( the grandmother), my daughter and my 16 year old grandson. The Whaler is a condo building ( 2 buildings, in fact) and the feel is that of your own apartment. Our unit was spacious and lovely. We rented a car for the duration of our stay and the parking garage was very convenient - we were in control of our coming and going. There was a $20.00 per night fee that is a ""resort"" fee.  The location is perfect - on the extensive walkway of hotels that run along the beach. The physical plant is magnificent with a central courtyard that is a botanical delight ( the koi pond has a feeding time activity for the kids). The lanais are quite ample and face the courtyard and ocean. As we returned from our long excursions we felt as though we coming to a real home.  There was a laundry room on the floor ( possibly a former closet) with one combo water/dryer. I was able to access it, but only after a few tries as it was often already in use. Not sure if I missed another laundry area. I enjoyed the workout room with excellent quality machines. The maintenance staff was very kind in inflating our tubes for ocean use.

Its proximity to Black Rock and to Whaler's Village was why we booked this particular condo. Views were awesome and the convenience to the beach walk for our morning walks was great. Unit 1115 was the perfect studio for my husband and I. The views were awesome....golf course to our left and pool and beach to our right, making sunset viewing on the lanai one of our favorite activities. The owners provided beach chairs, umbrella, and snorkel gear and the gift basket when we arrived was very considerate. Every single staff member at The Whaler was friendly and helpful, starting with the parking attendant, to the guys who handed out the beach towels.

510924077,40,Pleasant stay,"We spent three days at the Whaler for our anniversary and found the accommodation to be quite pleasant and relaxing. Easy to find and located right next to Whaler's Village, this property does not suffer from the feeling of overpopulation that many other properties along Kaanapali have fallen prey to.    There really is not a bad room on the property, as the intimate design of the two Towers create an experience where every room is located with either an excellent view or excellent proximity to amenities. Our unit, 170, was well appointed with traditional Hawaiian decor, and housekeeping staff was always prompt and thorough. We liked the ground floor location for easy access in and out, the pleasant and spacious Lanai, the complimentary guest laundry and of course, the convenience of having a kitchen so we could do some of our own cooking.    The pool area was small, but again clean and well attended. Our only significant disappointment was the fitness center… One of the primary reasons we had booked this property. Located in the basement of one of the towers, it was dimly lit, and felt claustrophobic and dank. Not the way I want to spend my time when in paradise. Would've been nice to see this facility on the ground level where people could appreciate some sunlight and pretty views.    Overall, if you are a fan of the Kaanapali region in Maui, this property offers all the amenities of the larger resorts with a much more intimate and peaceful feel. The simplistic and beautiful grounds provide a spacious complement to the navigable property. Views of Lana'i and Molokai will greet you each day.    If you've traveled to Maui and not stayed in Kihei or Wailea, you are missing out. Check out of their parts of the island to get a more traditional Hawaiian feel it move away from the big resorts, where in the least, take a day trip in your car.",Aug 2017,August 2017,Traveled as a couple,,"Fort Collins, Colorado"

Our lanai had a wonderful view of the ocean to the West and the mountains to the East. The Pool Concierges, Joseph and Michael, were amazing. They treated us like family. In addition to setting up our beach umbrella and chairs everyday, these 2 young men went above and beyond the normal concierge- making suggestions & reservations for nice dinners and activities.

Restaurants, small food court, and a modest ABC store all add up to real options. Beach was clean and fun.

The staff were always extremely helpful especially the conceiege dealing with booking trips for 8 of us. There was always spare chairs by the pool and beach and being by the surf and next to Whalers Village made it a very enjoyable 2weeks I would highly recommend this resort.

The pool wasn't the biggest in the world but was great to have a swim in, and there was quite a bit of seating/loungers available. The BBQ areas were also great if you wanted to have an evening of cooking outside for the family.

Each condo is separately owned and decorated differently. We stayed in Room 914 (which is one of the rooms pictured on websites). Our stay included daily maid service. We had a large balcony on which we enjoyed morning coffee and spectacular sunsets. The property is beautiful and clean. The staff was attentive and helpful. The location is perfect, next to Whaler Village and is on a 2+ mile Beach Walk for daily walking/running. It is 10 minutes from Lahaina and it's multiple shops and restaurants. The pool while not large was clean and comfortable. While it does lack all of the things that a large hotel would have (e.g. multiple pools, restaurants, bars, etc.) it does not have the big crowds and is close to major properties that have those amenities (we had meals and drinks at other properties nearby). It has underground parking so if you rent a car it will always be cool when getting in.

We had to go to Costco and buy a blow up mattress because the couch was MISERABLE. So we ended up with a big bed in the middle of the family room our entire vacation. This was bad. I thought I was booking a hotel, not an AirBnB.    GREAT LOCATION. Kitchen was great. Overall it was clean and comfortable. Pool was terrible! Not family friendly at all. No children toys are allowed (I literally think they have a pool policeman.) Beach is not safe for young children, very rough. Walk down towards the Sheraton where it's a little calmer.    Terrible spa. Do not book anything here.    This place has lots of pros and lots of cons. If you have children, the kitchen is definitely a pro. If you have children, it's also a huge con. Pool is terrible and it's really hard on the kids when you walk down the beach trail and pass all these amazing pools that are family friendly. I ended up crashing the Westin and the Hyatt pools but was stressed out the entire time.    I rated it very good because overall, it is. The ""bad"" are only my opinions.

The Whaler property is really very nice. Parking garage. It was much less crowded than some of the bigger resorts like the Westin and Sheraton. Very laid back atmosphere. Great access to all you could do on Kaanapali beach. We would stay here again without a doubt. It is arguably the best spot on Kaanapali beach. No rocks in the water and plenty of soft sand. It is adjacent to Whaler's Village shopping and restaurants. Great snorkeling right off the beach or a short stroll down to Black Rock. Short drive to Lahaina.

The owner has thought of all the things that make this Condo special for all his guest. The location is perfectly situated close to restaurants, golf, shopping, parasailing, snorkeling and all other kinds of beach activities (All within a very short walk). The views from the lanai are fantastic from waking up to a beautiful sunrise coming over the mountains to a day ending magnificent sunset over the ocean. You will be able to hear music from the Hula Grill and Leilani's from happy hour into the evening, but not to worry the music ends at approximately 9 P.M. You will see catamaran's coming and going for daily activities and evening sunset sails, just too many things to mention them all here.  The whalers staff was friendly and always eager to help. Their facilities are well maintained and things like free towel exchanges for the beach, and pool along with free beverages (non-alcoholic) morning, noon, and night are very nice touches. With parking coming at a premium on Maui the under ground parking garage is also a great part of the property.

This is most annoying! Also, any rooms facing the courtyard towards the new lobby will find blinding lights shinning up into their rooms at night. The only decent rooms are in the front.

People working at Aston at The Whaler on Kaanapali Beach in Maui were pretty rude to my husband and I. I think we were in a place where tourists aren't welcome and all they seemed to care about was money. The rooms we were given smelled like cigarettes and it was suppose to be a non smoking room. The staff and management said there was nothing they could do about it. However, aside from that, everything else in Maui has been great. I've found that most local Hawaiians are nicer to tourists than mainlanders working in the hotels.

The kitchen also had every thing we needed.    However, the pool was quite small and they did not have a restaurant or bar on the grounds.    With a $17 per day resort fee, it felt lacking, especially when compared to some of the other nearby places.    The other issue we had, which is common for all of the hotels, is the charges for a lounge chair or dual cabana style chairs for the beach. The hotels, including this one, charge anywhere from $65 - $85 per day!    Save yourself some money on that and snorkel rentals. Go local to places like Boss Frogs or one of the other rental places to rent your snorkel gear by the week. For chairs, look at Costco (near the airport) or other local stores and buy a chair and umbrella. Paying for that and leaving it will still be cheaper than renting.    At one point, the hotel thought we had the Do not disturb sign on our door, so they called the room to check! Other than that though, the staff was very nice and did a good job.

487106564,50,Wonderful Condo on Beautiful Beach,"I can’t imagine a more perfect place to stay on Kaanapali Beach than The Aston at The Whaler. This condo complex deserves to rated #1 on trip advisor! We were vacationing in Maui to celebrate 40 years of marriage. Check in was completed quickly and we were surprised by fresh pineapple, chocolate covered macadamia nuts and Champagne when we got to our room. We stayed in a Studio Ocean View Premium Suite 1264. Very clean and nicely furnished with an outstanding view of Kaanapali beach and the courtyard from our spacious Lanai. The Lanai had a small table, two chairs and a lounge chair with space between for walking around comfortably. Kitchen had newer appliances. There was a small dining table for four, a couch and two chairs which we never used because if we were there we were outside enjoying our Lanai. The condo had a Murphy bed which was the only thing I probably would have changed. Although we slept fine, a comfy regular bed with better support would have been preferred. Fell asleep first night to the wonderful lapping of the ocean, does not get much better than that. Housekeeping did a wonderful job of cleaning every day and restocking our towels, coffee and complimentary shampoo, lotions and soaps.  Grounds although not extravagant were very pretty and enjoyable. Pool and hot tub were good sized and chairs were monitored so if they were left vacant for an hour they became available which was really nice! Always seating available if wanted. There was complimentary ice tea and water by the pool and in the lobby during the day. Beach was wide and had comfortable lounge chairs right in the sand which we sat and enjoyed beautiful sunsets from.  The location cannot be beat. Although there are no “onsite” restaurants you are steps away from the Hula Grill and Leilani's on the Beach both of which have great food and live entertainment. You are also a short walk from Whaler’s Village which had an ABC store perfect for picking up those little odds and ends you find you need without driving anywhere.  The underground parking was a bonus. There were only 2 nights out of seven that we did not find parking there. They even provided little shopping carts outside of the automatically opening underground entry doors which immediately led to elevators so you could easily transport things up to your condo if you needed.  We were allowed to stay in our condo for an extra hour till noon on the last day which was a blessing since our flight did not leave till 5:00 pm. The front desk staff was very accommodating and held our luggage after we were checked out and even made sure my chocolate covered macadamia nuts were in a fridge so they would not melt on me without me asking, very thoughtful.

It had a full kitchen, large bathroom, large sleeping area and furniture and a great lanai (balcony). Our unit was on the third floor facing North, which gave us a view of the gardens and onto an adjacent building, but with an ocean view to the side. The unit was privately owned - I'm assuming most or all are privately owned as well, so there could be variations in quality of renovations and finishes between different suites. Ours was excellent. The check-in experience was surprisingly efficient and very pleasant, which sets a positive tone right from the start. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Gardens are beautiful and well maintained. There is a modest pool which we didn't use because the beach was right next to us and so accessible. We checked out several other beaches all over Maui and didn't find any we liked more than Kaanapali beach, right in front of the Aston Whaler. They have a towel service and provide lounge chairs, but extra charge for sun umbrella. The hotel also has free laundry facilities on each floor and a really nice common BBQ/outdoor dining area facing the beach. There are no restaurants on the resort but many restaurants/pubs and amenities within a close walk. (Whalers village is right next door). We were pleasantly surprised how quiet and peaceful the hotel was at night, maybe because there are no attached amenities. We often kept the patio doors open at night and heard nothing but waves. Meals and drinks in the area are expensive so it's nice to have a kitchen. Great snorkeling right off the beach with Black Rock (coral reef) right there at the end of the beach. We saw turtles, fish, coral, etc, and I spotted a reef shark while snorkeling one day off Black Rock (reef sharks are basically harmless).

We rented through a rental company not directly through the Whaler so we knew exactly what we were getting. It exceeded anything we had ever expected. We were on the top floor of Tower 2. The sunsets at night were amazing, didn't have to go anywhere to enjoy them, the show was put on for us nightly without ever having to leave our wrap around lanai (the largest lanai I have ever seen). The condo was spotless with everything you would ever need, beach chairs, boogie boards, coolers, beach towels, umbrellas, etc. What more could you ask for? The owners obviously take great pride in their property and it shows throughout. The resort is beautiful, hard to believe this was built in the 1970's. The new lobby is stunning, all open air a wonderful relaxing space. The koi pond and waterfall is beautiful along with the grounds and landscaping, everything was so meticulous. We didn't use the pool, why since the most gorgeous beach is directly in front of it. There is a beach shack where you can rent chairs and umbrellas, paddle boards and anything else you need. We loved that the beach wasn't overly crowded, you had your own space without being on top of each other. Clear gorgeous water to swim in or just to cool off in. Some good wave action for boogie boarding or body surfing, just be careful a strong undertow at times. Whaler Village is right next door with shopping and restaurants, a minutes walk.

Nothing pretentious here, just great friendly guests all of the time.    The kitchen is great! The BBQ's by both Towers are great! The staff is friendly!    Beware, if you stay here, you run the risk of falling in love with the property!    No nickel and dime treatment, great options for the family or couples.

The location was excellent with Whalers Village just a few steps away, making it easy to find places to shop and good restaurants. Whale watching from our Lanai was another highlight as were the evening sunsets. Self-parking was sometimes a challenge, but there is an additional, adjacent lot available when the covered parking is full. Laundry facilities were available on each floor, we prefer in-unit laundry, but it was acceptable. Staff was friendly and responded quickly to requests. An in-unit safe was a nice convenience. The grounds were well kept and very nice. We didn’t use the pool, so I cannot comment on that. The beach walkway was beautiful and well maintained. The $16/day additional fee seemed excessive.

469898078,10,"Condo #252 not even remotely ""as advertised"". Promises way more than delivered.","If you're considering renting this condo, let me warn you about what you'll find when you get there. View was great. Check in smooth and staff very nice. However, when you enter the front door you'll be in for a big and not pleasant surprise. This condo would be considered substandard. If you're like me, you read these reviews thinking sometimes that some people just can't be satisfied. I'm not one of those people. I tried my best to work out my differences with the owner, but after admitting that the condo was in terrible condition, he refused to even consider giving me a 2-night refund on my 7-night stay, saying that I was just trying to put the squeeze on him and why didn't I just leave and find other accommodations when I discovered the condition of the condo. I'd say that's a text book case of blaming the messenger. If you rent this condo and expect anything more than a good view, then you will be disappointed. Knobs missing on appliances, cabinet doors that are just barely hanging on their hinges and door latches that are so worn out, the cabinet doors will not close. Oh yea, if you're planning on going out onto the lanai to enjoy the view, you will definitely need help in opening the sliding glass doors. And if you happen to be a little heavy-set, you may not be able to open the doors wide enough to go thru. Mattresses just a step above sleeping on the floor. Hardest I've ever slept on. Also, take some duct tape with you if you expect to plug in a phone charger. The 110v outlets are so old, the charger plugs won't stay plugged in without tape. Now to the furnishings. One word said 3 times, ""old, old, old"". Base boards beat all to hell with dirty residue from numerous carpet cleanings. Pictures removed from the walls, but hangers, screws and nails remained. As I said, I tried to be a reasonable voice in this matter and attempted to get the owner to understand why I was so upset and believed I deserved some credit on my rent. But, he's just unreasonable and offered no relief. If you rent this condo and something goes wrong, you will have to deal with an owner that cares little about you. HE WILL KEEP YOUR MONEY WITH THE ATTITUDE THAT YOU ARE NOT IMPORTANT. Good luck!

Everybody so friendly and always ready to help. Really cool watch the fish feeding at the pond. I think for my 3 years old daughter that was the best part of vacation. Generally I can say that people who work there like their job and make everybody feel welcome. Nice shopping mall next door makes location even better.

To beach is connected to the property so you don't have far to walk if you are carrying stuff to enjoy on the beach. The water is warm and lots of sand to play in. About a quarter mile from this hotel is the famous Black Rock which is some of the best snorkeling on the island. I saw an octopus, turtles and eel along with fish when I was there. The pool has a lot of lounge chairs and cabanas but even when the majority of chairs were taken, you never felt crowded. There is a large pond with Koi fish that the kids can feed every morning. Our room was a one bedroom condo and it was huge and very nice. Every staff member we encountered was very friendly.

457949717,40,Exceeded expectations - wonderful property! Room 224,"Exceeded our expectations. The new lobby is beautiful and the desk and bell staff were so welcoming. Parking is plentiful and close to the rooms.    You won't like this hotel and should look elsewhere if:    You want a big pool or more than one pool    You want umbrella drinks delivered to your beach chair or food delivered to your room    You want a bar on site    It's a timeshare condo building, not a resort.    But you will love it, as we did, because:  The property was very well maintained but the landscapers and cleaning staff were quiet and respectful. Lovely landscaping and a fun koi pond. Ample green space for small kids to wander. As I said, the one pool is small - we are not pool people and never went near it.    The ability to get chairs and towels for free was a nice surprise! The stretch of beach out front was sandy and wide. Even when the ocean is flat, however, there is a surf break and a good wave. It was too rough for our one year old to stand at the edge, but once you get past that break you are waist high and it's sandy and lovely. Or you can walk to the calmer Black rock in five minutes and swim there, much gentler wave at the water line.  Location next to Whalers' Village was very convenient, but your restaurant options are fairly limited if you don't want to drive or cook in your full kitchen. You can easily walk to four plus restaurants and four other food court type places.  If you stay in tower 2, note the construction at Whaler's village. It was noisy. We were in tower one (room 224) and it was very quiet and peaceful. You can google properly maps and figure out exactly where your room is. The only rooms I would avoid would be the south facing ones in the tower 2 next to Whaler's Village. Hula Grill can be a little noisy too but you have AC so not a deal breaker.    Our room was large, clean, airy, bright and so QUIET! Maybe it was because we were there during an off week or we just lucked out with quiet neighbors but we didn't hear the other guests at all. A couple of door slams but this place is definitely 90% snow birds and retirees.    Everything worked great (ac, appliances). We enjoyed the quality deck furniture: table and chairs, rocking chair, and lounge chairs. Love that we had a view of the ocean and overlooked a quiet lawn. Having two bathrooms was great. Our unit had plush carpeting in most of it. It was more dated than other rooms we saw but we didn't need granite to enjoy our stay. It was clean, spacious, and serviceable. Most or all rooms have a Murphy bed in the living room.    Four (and a half) stars because the mattress really needs replacing - it is obviously quite old and was very saggy.",Feb 2017,February 2017,Traveled with family,,"Boston, MA"

The room is nice beachy but 80's so that is hand in hand. It is accommodating with a full kitchen and washer dryer on same level. Large balcony which is awesome.  Wide bathroom counter separate from closet and shower toilet room which is nice with multiple guests.    The bed is a kind and coach is a fold out with sheets.    The grounds and the reception area are magnificent too bad no bar area they could clean up. Probably a million a year missed there just in alcohol sales.    Very well maintained grounds again the room is nice but some things dated.

This was the first trip we have arranged ourselves and we chose the Aston as our place to stay. We could not have been happier. At the 5 star places the expectations are so high it seems there is always something that doesn't quite make it. Here we were consistently impressed and our expectations were consistently exceeded. The condo was clean, comfortable, well equipped and had a beautiful lanai. The property seemed well maintained, had a nice pool and hot tub and was steps from the beach and Whaler's Village. The staff were helpful without being intrusive. We loved it and are already planning on a trip for our entire family later this year or early next.

457133408,50,Just Plain Perfect,"The Whaler does not have the ""feel"" of a HOTEL in the traditional sense, and that is  meant as a compliment. Although there is a very modern and pleasing reception lobby, complete with bellman and concierge services, there are no restaurants and bars and bustling shops. Staying at a unit at the Whaler is very much like staying in your own beach front Condo: quiet, private, relaxing. We thoroughly enjoyed our three weeks at Whaler unit #515 and are looking forward to a return visit. We have ZERO complaints and MANY praises for the Whaler in general and #515 specifically. This studio unit is exceptionally well planned, very nicely appointed, and impeccably maintained.

We booked with an owner, rather than the website because I made a last minute reservation and could negotiate for a larger place. We also could choose location. The location is great - located next to Whaler's village. The pool is small and was very cold, but there are ample chairs. A quick walk over to the Westin in the morning for coffee and a walk downstairs to 2 good restaurants.

454084168,40,Great place to stay at Kaanapali Beach,"We were there in mid December. Booked the property on the property website, not with an owner because we wanted to have housekeeping and the like while there. We booked a ""premium"" studio condo because we heard that the non-premium rooms were out-dated and not as nice. We definitely loved our room. See pictures below. The view from the Lanai was fantastic. The bell hop was very courteous and knowledgeable. There was 2 bottled waters in our refrigerator and a cut up pineapple upon check in. Delicious!!    All the appliances in the kitchen worked great. There is even an ice maker in the freezer. There was dual sinks in the bathroom, which was nice. A separate closet with a safe and plenty of hangers. There is also a washer and dryer on each floor and the hotel provides you with detergent. We didn't use this, but if we had stayed any longer, we would have. The shower was nice also with a place to sit. Great underground parking that is free with the resort fee. The wifi is also included with resort fee and works great! The air conditioning worked great and the ceiling fan worked great. The bed was very hard and I woke up with a back ache each day.    The worst thing about the trip was it rained a lot. Another couple we met said they have been going there for 10 years in a row, and this was the worst weather they ever encountered. Just my luck. We stayed 7 days and really only had 1 day without rain. The TV in the room has a DVR so we were able to record our favorite show and watch it one day when it was raining, so that was nice.    There is a Safeway grocery store not too far and we stocked up on bottled water (the tap water is horrible), snacks and some beer and wine. If you have never been to a Safeway, take the extra minute to sign up for their rewards program while there. We saved $60! There is also an ABC store at the Whaler's village next door, which has tons of drinks, alcohol, souvenirs and some food as well.    The Whaler's village is still under construction, but the hotel's lobby construction was completed while we were there. It looks great! The Whaler's village construction is noisy, but we didn't hear it from our room.    Housekeeping: The dishwasher had a warning sign that it needed some rinse aid. So, I left a note for the housekeeper about it and she wrote me back ""select cycle, then close"". Huh? I didn't ask how to work the dishwasher. Not sure if there was a language barrier. The next day, I put the card in the lock that says ""Privacy please"" on one side and ""service needed"" on the other and I turned it so the ""service needed"" sign was showing. I did not get any service that entire day. I wasn't sure if they didn't realize that the card had two different messages on it or not. Then, the next day, she showed up while we were changing into our swimsuits and asked her if she would give us a minute so we could change and we would be out of her way. She said No. So, we just asked for new towels and we didn't get service again. On the other days, the service was good. I left a tip each day but not sure why after that last encounter.    The pool was just okay. It is deep. In the areas where it says it is 4 foot, it was more like 5 foot. I am only 5'2"" and I couldn't not stand anywhere and touch the ground except on the steps. That kinda sucked. However, you could bring your own drink down (plastic cups only). Since we had stocked our refrigerator, I liked this option better than being at a big hotel and paying an arm and a leg for a drink at the pool.    The grounds were beautiful with a goldfish pond and grass that felt like carpet on your bare feet. The beach was also beautiful, very soft sand.    As I mentioned, we were able to walk to Whaler's for restaurants and shopping and were able to walk to other hotels for restaurants/bars also. But, we did rent a car because it was so cheap and we were able to visit other nearby towns (like Lahaina).    All in all, we loved our stay here and would return in a heart beat.

Many koi fish in the pond which you can feed at 8:30am. Parking was easy in the single story garage. These units are by owner. Loved the easy access to the beach with many options to explore either on your own or you can pay for excursions. Towel, chaise, chair, umbrella, paddleboard kiosk employee Dave was helpful and super nice. We snorkled straight out in the clear blue water and saw many returning turtles....they were huge. Paddleboarding was very therapeutic too. Also there is free laundry you can do on your own with the provided detergent.    At mile marker 10 1/2 we went on a 5hr, 5.5mile kayak adventure where we saw endangered monk seals, beautiful lavender/orange coral and many varieties of fish.

452225683,30,"Nice Hotel, Great Beach and Location - but Avoid Tower 2","Our family (2 adults and 3 teenagers) rented a 2BR/2BA condo in the Whaler just after the New Year's holiday in January 2017. The Whaler is a fairly nice hotel - two towers built probably in the 1980's perched on the edge of a big, gorgeous beach with phenomenal views of the ocean and the majestic peaks of Lanai and Molokai in the distance. The beach is clean and well-tended, though busy. Kaanapali is a development of about a dozen resorts and condo towers, along with a mall, restaurants, and a golf course. So while you are definitely not on some secluded beach, it isn't too crowded and there is lots to do close by.    Our unit was a fourth floor condo on the southwest corner of Tower 2. The unit was spacious and well appointed - full kitchen with pots and pans, etc. The best feature was a wrap-around balcony that provided a direct view of the scenic green West Maui mountains, and a decent sliver of the ocean on the side. The unit was clean and housekeeping was good, but the furnishings and decorating were dated and tired -- it looked like things had not been updated since the 80's. But the large unit size compensated for that for our family.    The biggest problem with Tower 2 is its proximity to the adjacent Whaler's Village shopping center next door to the south. Whaler's Village is an upscale mall, and it is currently undergoing major construction. While I had read on this site about Whaler's Village construction during the summer of 2016, I thought it would be done by the time we visited. No such luck. Not only is the construction not finished as of January 2017, it looks as though it still has another year to go. That means another year of the engine noise of excavators, the buzzing of circular saws, the pounding of hammers, and the constant ""beep-beep-beep"" of trucks and their reverse beacons. While we spent as much time away from the room as possible, the work started every morning at 6:30 am, so it was like an alarm clock. I doubt the construction noise is much of a factor for 75% of the Whaler's guests, but everyone on the south side of Tower 2 was all too aware of it.    But honestly, even without the construction, that side of Tower 2 is likely still the noisiest part of the hotel. The north side of Whaler's Village (the side that faces the hotel) is its ""service"" end -- that's where the parking garage and the loading docks are located. So even under normal circumstances, Whaler guests on the south side of Tower 2 will have to endure motorcycles in the parking garage, loud refrigerated trucks, garbage trucks emptying the dumpsters, and the ubiquitous reverse beacons of the delivery trucks. So, if possible, avoid the south side of Tower 2 if you stay at the Whaler. For us, the noise is what lowered our review from four stars to three stars.    Overall, the Whaler is a nice hotel in a good location with a fantastic beach. While it is not a ""five star"" hotel, it gets you close to all of the great activities in Maui, which itself is definitely a ""five star"" destination.",Jan 2017,January 2017,Traveled with family,"Avoid Tower 2, especially the south side.",

Great amenities, awesome condos, best location on the beach, with easy access to restaurants, snorkeling (at Black Rock is some of the best on Maui), Great BBQ's, kitchens, patio's, and the pool is the closest to the ocean of any resort.    Easy access to shopping at the Whaler's Village, or a short ride into Lahaina, has us head over heals for this place. The people staying here, are here to have fun, relax, and enjoy life (what a Hawaii trip should be). Many of the other spots are more into showing off what kind of rental car you got, or women bragging about how much they spent on a swimsuit, and they can't even swim in it (I've heard it all around the pools at 3 other resorts on the island).    If you want fun, the most convenient location for beach, food, shopping, and entertainment, no spot is better on Maui!

The only problem we had was the original room assigned to us (1215) had one entire wall of mirrors. About 20' of mirrors. The place was lovely otherwise, but there is no way I was going to stare at myself the entire week. Plus the reflection of the ocean and sun was so incredibly bright that I would have had to wear sunglasses in the room. I also note that everyone is trying to convert their lights to the more efficient LEDs. That is okay, but please keep in mind that those lightbulbs in older lights give off a non pleasing glow.

A short walk to the North takes you to world famous Black Rock where you can snorkel and jump off. There are not only plenty of fish to see but lots of turtles too!

I wasn't aware there was remodeling going on and I had no idea of the check-in procedure as no one was in the underground parking area to direct me. But once I got to my room, all was fine. There were a few minor issues in my room that were immediately rectified by the front desk and housekeeping. My room was tidied up each day and having a kitchen really helped keep food costs down. The pool was relaxing and the beach was tons of fun! The resort is next to lots of shopping and restaurants so you can pick up any essentials without having to drive anywhere. I had an ocean view and took advantage of it whenever I could! If I ever come back to Maui, I will definitely stay here!!  OH, and the staff was friendly and courteous!!

439404909,50,Incredible Place to Stay,"This place was great from the beginning. First, it is in the perfect location on Kaanapali beach. It is next to restaurants and shops in Whalers Village and is a couple minutes walk from the best hotels such as the Sheraton, Westin, Marriott and Hyatt. There is no better beach section of Kaanapali than this. This size of black rock bay (5 min walk) is by far the nicer side. Snorkelling with a bounty of different fish and even sea turtles is easy in the mornings. Rooms were beautiful (paid an extra $20 per night for the renovated sweet and would recommend it). There is simply no value in staying at a hotel for the price comparison. The Whaler is cheaper than the hotels next to it, will give you a far larger room with kitchen to prep your own meals, and you aren't forced to spend a fortune on hotel food if you choose not to. I have stayed at the Westin and the whaler is far nicer on a room cleanliness and decor scale. The nice part is that if you want to grab a drink or use the pool facilities at the Westin, it's only a 5 minute walk and no one bothers you about it. I will be back here year after year. 10/10",Nov 2016,September 2016,Traveled as a couple,,
439290241,50,Great Room on Northside of Tower I,"OK, I think I have figured this out. The Whaler does not have as many rooms to rent out as they used to and we need to be more flexible when we arrive as we really do not want to stay anywhere else when on-island. Due to construction at Whaler's Village next door, and to the hotel lobby as well, when they did not have a high floor premium studio on the s/s of tower II as we requested we did not panic. We ended up 'upgrading' to a perfect one-bedroom premium ocean view on the Black Rock side of Tower I. Front desk folks were great and the upgrade cost was minimal. Opened the sliding glass doors to the birds singing, kids laughing, and the waves crashing on Ka'anapali Beach so we knew we were where we always want to be.    New owners of the condo we were in so they were missing a few items in the kitchen but we made do....and left them a list!!!!! Ice maker did not work but the maintenance crew worked hard to find the issue to no avail. No problem as ice was offered from the front desk and we know where the local Safeway is. Cooked grilled and blackened dolphin fish with a papaya salsa with mashed Maui potatoes and sautéed Kula onions and Brussels sprouts for dinner one night, followed by pan sautéed Maui potato chip and macadamia encrusted ono, rice pilaf cooked with a fresh veggie stock, and mixed local veggies including Hamakua mushrooms...both dinners were delicious. Our steak dinner??? Not so much as the steak was not good at all.....will go back to Ulapalakua Ranch and Maui Cattle Co. next time as we normally do.    The pool water was exceptionally warm and we wondered if it was the time of year we were here (we normally come in May) or if they had added heaters. No issue with us as the water was delightful, as was the vibe with older folks and young couples with small children. Beach was great as normal despite the winter swell, the room was clean, the shower and double shower heads were great, and the bed was hard enough to make my aching back feel better. Just what the doctor ordered for a bit of rest and relaxation.    People like what they like, and we're huge fans of these condos and their location on Ka'anapali Beach. But just for information, we had stayed at the Ritz Kapalua for the proceeding week due to a work conference my wife attended. My wife casually mentioned that maybe we could leave the Ritz and head to the condo early....we researched it and switched locations a day earlier than planned. I just wish that we would have thought of it earlier in the week as the commute was only 15 minutes. The Whaler better than the Ritz????

432306703,40,Great Location,"It takes about an hour (with traffic) to drive here from the airport/road to Hana/the crater....so consider the location. We found the location to work for us even though it was a bit of a drive for most of the activities we planned. It was a great location on the beach and in walking distance from the mall and a few restaurants.    There was construction but we but we never heard it. We were on the opposite side of the courtyard and hardly/never at the hotel pool or beach during the day.    We stayed here for 5 nights. The day we arrived a bellman met us. It was a nice gesture--but I'm the type that likes to haul my own bags and not have to tip someone to do it but I didn't feel like I had the chance to say no. We were staying for a honeymoon and had fresh water, pineapple, champagne & chocolates waiting in our room which was so nice!    We had an updated, nice room with a good view of he beach. We overlooked the shopping area and every night until about 10 had live music that we thought was coming from the nearby restaurants but was coming from the mall. We Personally didn't mind the music.    The staff at both check in and check out were cranky. Housekeeping tend the bell promptly at 9am every morning, which to us was annoying. But we never did ask them to come later. We did however call the 24-7 office one night and asked for. I housekeeping the following day--they said they would pass the message but housekeeping came anyway...which I was not happy about at all. Not only that but they also took my paper bags I had stored behind the garbage that I was keeping. When I called the office they didn't care.    The pool is nice. You can't take any chairs on to the beach unless you want to pay an arm and a leg. (Which I guess most hotels on the beach have that rule but it is soooo dumb! Don't we pay enough to stay here?!) the staff at the cabana was horrible every single day.    -There is a spa--we didn't use it.  -There is a gym--looks nice we didn't use it.  -There is a sauna--didn't use it.  -There are bathrooms in tower 1 with showers next to the gym. One of the staff told us we could use them since we had to check out early but our flight didn't leave until 10pm and we were going to spend the day at the pool/beach. But then we got yelled at for using the facilities after checking out. Which again, I was not happy about at all. So rude...we notified staff and got the approval and then we ""got in trouble""    So would I stay here again? Maybe. Although reading other reviews from frequent visitors it seems thins with staff and construction doesn't change.",Oct 2016,October 2016,,,
430222908,50,Fabulous Apartments with everything for the perfect Tropical Getaway,"A peaceful oasis on the most stunningly beautiful beach. Perfectly situated to watch the amazing sunsets. I was delighted with my apartment. Spacious, full kitchen, 2 bathrooms, extra large bed, wrap around balcony with loungers and outdoor furniture, a view of the volcano and the morning sun on one side, the garden and sea view the other.  On arrival there was water in the fridge and fresh pineapple, beautifully presented, ready to eat.  The lobby operates 24/7, check in and checkout was smooth and hassle free. The staff certainly made you feel at home and were incredibly helpful with huge welcoming smiles. They are currently rebuilding the lobby so have a temporary one in the basement but I didn't experience any noise from the construction.  There is an in house spa on the lower level. Seemed to me like massage was a specialty, the fragrance of lots of essential oils around. I didn't get the opportunity to try them out as I was attending an event during their opening hours.  At the beachfront is a lovely swimming pool and a spa pool with plenty of loungers to sit and contemplate the ocean. There are chairs and towels available for the beach as well. Each tower also has an oceanfront barbecue area for guests to use that were well used during my stay.  There is a restful space between the two towers with a beautiful garden and koi pond. Wander over the bridge and out to the ocean walk to one of the best restaurants next door Hula Grill or Lelani's close by. You are now at the ocean entrance to The Whalers Village. An 60 store boutique shopping mall with a small food court. There is also a Roy's Restaurant nearby which I would definitely recommend for a celebratory dinner.

The room was not updated and frankly could use one but was suitable for what we needed. The Whaler staff was so very courteous and attentive from the minute we drove up to the security kiosk at the property. Although undergoing some construction renovations of their common area lobby, they has easy workarounds and were so very helpful! We were treated like ohana throughout our stay.

We only had 1 issue upon check-in...we thought the room number they gave us was 2602 and it was 260. The only number we had was the toll free number for reservations; we called there to see what we had wrong and Brenda was very unhelpful, all she would have had to do was tell us what option we should pick when calling back. Pretty stressful moment.    But! It was our anniversary and the resort sent up champagne and yummy pineapple. We felt appreciated.

Be aware construction is happening next door and the lobby, noise can be disruptive. Should finish lobby by Christmas, at shopping center next door, not sure when construction ends.    Beach amenities are nice (free beach chairs and towels), many units include boogie boards, umbrellas, sand toys and floaties for kids and personal beach chairs.    Our unit faced whaler village shopping center and was one back from ocean front on upper floor. Beautiful sunset views, and stunning beach views all day (spotted sea turtles every day). Would rent this side again.    A few years ago rented upper unit facing Blackrock a few units back from ocean front, and again views were stunning. Can't go wrong on either of the outside units in either Tower.    Also, everyone (owners, renters and locals) are super friendly).    If it is your first visit, be sure to stock up on food, beer, other drinks, etc. at Costco near airport before driving to Whaler.

As said by others, it doesn't look like there is a bad view from any rooms here. From the balcony of this room, you can see the ocean - including most of Black Rock, the north lawn, and the golf course and mountains. I definitely recommend Tower 1 with a north side room. 5th floor or higher offers the best views. From the elevator lobbys on each floor, you can also see the courtyard,koi pond, and pool areas. If your budget allows, I would recommend a 1 or 2 bedroom suite as they seem to have the best locations. I'm not sure I would recommend the 'Premium' rooms as the accommodations weren't really that 'deluxe' for the extra money.    The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful as was the concierge.

There is construction going on as they rebuild the lobby but I honestly didn't hear any noise in our unit. We were in the tower with a view of Black Rock beach and not facing the mountain or inside of the complex so that certainly helped. The staff was pleasant and easy to deal with. It is located on a nicer part of Kaanapali beach and a short walk to some good restaurants in the Whaler's Village. We really had everything that we needed. We met three groups of people who vacation in Maui and stay in these condos every year. They all said that they've stayed in other Kaanapali hotels and The Whaler has all of these other places beat. That speaks volumes for me.  We booked through The Whaler and not on VRBO or directly through the individual owner so we had daily housekeeping service which supplies towels, bathroom supplies and products, dishwasher soap, and trash removal.  We didn't need to use the concierge but were told that she is an excellent resource for setting up golfing times and can arrange for someone to bring clubs directly to the condo for your use.

My wife and I only wanted a place to sleep, shower and eat a few meals...so we ended up with a studio condo.    Our particular condo was more of the older and tired variety - but it had everything we needed. Better yet, the price was right.    The best part about the Whaler is the location - centrally located in the Ka'anapali area, right next to Whaler's Village, and a very short walk to some of the best snorkeling on Maui and the Black Rock.    While we love the Whaler for a variety of reasons, the constant construction is getting a bit old. First it was the pool area, then it was tower 1 renovations, then it was the courtyard. Guess what? This time it was the office/check in area. What this means is that during the week while sitting by the pool or oceanside out front - it gets very noisy. A further frustration is that Whaler's Village itself was under construction as well.    We will likely go back (one last try?). However, if you are considering booking at the Whaler....ASK QUESTIONS!!!! Is there any construction currently underway? If so, when is it expected to be finished? If it is going on during my desired dates of stay, is my rate being discounted? If no construction is currently underway, is any anticipated? So on and so forth...

The gardeners are miserable under paid slaves .we heard one of them being scolded by what at first glace i would slice up as,a meth head supervisor..back to the hotel..been here 6 days ..since they are doing renovations they didnt bother to mention upon booking theres no wifi at the pool.. you cant use the in house printer or computer after days of asking...crap my 24 year old daughter could have the entire network up in a,hour. But remember these folks,are doing us a favor to rent to us tourists. Then last but not least .the demolition noise ... yes no warning no advance notice half the property is under demolition .bob cats bull dozers kack hammers ...makes for a great tour of maui ...yeah right.. anyway sad to say this,will be the last time we come here.the aloha.the famlies that used to care no longer work here just frumpy employees ...the pool and cabana employees,are teenagers ..it just doesnt work anymore ... theres tons of other accomidations",Aug 2016,August 2016,Traveled as a couple,,
404366458,50,Great place to stay,"We stayed here after leaving Oahu and this place was much better! We loved our stay here.

403194706,50,"Stay here for the location - very central, and the suites - huge!","We stayed in room 920 in tower 2 facing north in a one bedroom suite - HUGE suite, gorgeous views from our very spacious lanai over to the beach/Black Rock as well as over to the golf course and the mountains, and excellent location close to the Whalers Village for shops / restaurants and of course to the beach. The pool isn't one of the amazing crazy pools you see in the other resorts but that wasn't really important for us - can imagine it would be for families with older kids though who would just want to play in the pool all day. Little kids loved the 8.30am daily koi fish feeding at the pond, get there early or you'll miss out on the feed. The gardens were impeccably kept and the doorman service very friendly. Highly recommended.",Aug 2016,July 2016,,,Sydney
401641726,50,Much better than a hotel,"Just returned from a great 8 nights stay at the Whaler. We stayed in a premium ocean view studio on the top floor of tower 2, facing north towards tower 1 and Black Rock. The apartment was excellent and spacious, it was decorated to a high standard and had quality appliances in the kitchen, perfect for our cooking needs. There was plenty of storage space and the balcony was large with a table, chairs and a lounger. There is no washer or dryer in the apartment but there are shared ones on each floor. The direction in relation to the sun for this side of tower 2 means that it is shaded in the afternoons so If we ever stay here again we would try and stay in tower 1 facing south, as these balconies get all of the afternoon sun.    The hotel grounds were immaculately kept and had a nice Koi pond between the 2 towers.    The pool was not huge but there were plenty of loungers and umbrellas for shade. The staff are also strict on the rules against diving into the pool and the use of inflatable devices, so even though the area is small and was quite often busy, it was never too noisy or rowdy. There was no pool bar but in some ways this was a bonus. Rather than buying expensive food and drink items from a pool bar, you can just buy everything you need cheaply from the local ABC store or the other shops in the nearby Whalers village and take it back to the pool.    We were extremely happy with our choice of accommodation and we would certainly stay here again.",Aug 2016,July 2016,Traveled as a couple,,Sunshine Coast
401506789,50,Aston at the Whaler; Unit 315,"My wife found this great ocean-view studio on VRBO. We called John and Valene (the owners) and they returned our call within 10 minutes. We leased the unit for the last 9 nights of July and only wish we could have stayed longer. The unit is very tastefully decorated and has everything you could ever need for your vacation in Maui, down to lounge chairs and an umbrella for the beach. Books for reading and DVD's for watching. Wireless internet and cable TV. The walk-in shower is great and has a beautiful mural in one of the walls. The king-sized bed is very comfortable. Being on the third floor, it only takes a minute to reach the lobby floor and walk out to the ocean or pool. The proximity to Black Rock and Whaler's Village is very convenient. We enjoyed having a drink and sitting on the lanai every evening as well as breakfast out there every morning. We highly recommend this unit and encourage any couple wanting the perfect place to make your home while on Maui to contact the owners via VRBO about this unit. We loved it and will definitely return!",Aug 2016,July 2016,Traveled as a couple,,"Simpsonville, South Carolina"
400766103,50,Why stay in a hotel?,"Just returned from a week in Maui. We rented 2 condos at the Whaler, a studio and a one-bedroom unit. This was our second trip to the Whaler, and we have now rented 4 different units during those stays.    Situated right next to Whaler's Village (shops, ABC store, restaurants), the Whaler is perfectly situated for a Hawaii vacation. Lots of activities within walking distance, and very close to Black Rock.    For the price, there is NO reason to stay at one of the nearby hotels. None. Well, the only one I can think of is access to hotel pools. The Westin has a pretty nice pool area, and my son can confirm if you stroll in, you will be walked out !    But pool aside (and the Whaler does have a pool, just not as large or as swank as the hotels) the Whaler gives you everything the hotel does plus.    Studios - about 400 sq feet. And practically all have a partial ocean view (see below for details). Try that with the hotels.  One bedroom - about 750 sq ft. they come with either 1 bathroom or 2. If 2 bathrooms is desirable, pay attention when booking. Remember, these units are privately owned so decor varies. Some have pullout sofas in the living room, a few have Murphy beds. Occupancy max is set by owners.  Two bedrooms - a few units have two bedrooms and 2 baths.    As said above, units are privately owned so decor varies. Fairly substantially. Of the 4 we have rented, they range from mid-range hotel quality up to WOW. Some have standard grade tub/shower, our last 1 bedroom had a gorgeous tiled walk-in shower with 2 shower heads.    Eating in Hawaii is expensive. No doubt. Renting at the Whaler makes this closer to affordable for us mainlanders. Every unit we have rented has a fridge, microwave, stove,, coffee maker, dishes and pots and pans. Why spend $100+ on breakfast? The Whaler also has grills/barbecues available for guest use. We did that a lot at dinner time. Word of warning again, the units are privately owned so kitchen supplies will vary from unit to unit. The ABC store at Whalers Village has limited grocery items, we find we need to head out to a supermarket to get everything we need.    Couple other things we learned last trip    There is now a daily resort fee of $16.67/day. This gets you access to pool chairs and towels, parking, boarding pass printing in the business center off the lobby and access to their fitness center (haven't seen that myself yet). Each floor also has a washer and dryer and use is also included in the resort fee. I think the resort fee began in April 2016 (?).    Parking is underground between the two towers. But it does fill up. We went out to a luau one night and there was no underground parking available at 9 pm. There is additional parking above ground on property, it is just a little further away,.    More on the underground parking. Direct access to each of the towers via motion sensing doors. Great if your hands are full with luggage, children, souvenirs, etc. There are also shopping carts by the doors, so if you go to the supermarket you can easily transport your purchases to your unit. They do encourage recycling (paper, plastic bottles, glass) so please do that !    Beginning in August 2016 they are planning on substantially renovating the lobby building and area. The desk clerk I spoke with said they are going to open it up and make it (more) inviting (there is nothing wrong with it now). Bear that in mind, construction noise may be an issue for the rest of 2016.    Which reminds me. Construction noise. Whalers Village is undergoing a BIG renovation and there is a lot of construction activity. If you are in Tower 2 on the Whalers Village side, be aware.    Which gets me to the layout of the property. Before you rent anything here, do your homework and know where your unit will be. The 4 options are quite different. The Whaler has 2 towers, both perpendicular to the beach and ocean (this is why EVERY unit has an ocean view).    Tower 1 - Black Rock side. These units are even-numbered from 02 to 24. For example, the end oceanfront unit on the 12th floor is #1202 (and is the only 3 bedroom unit). These units face Black Rock and Molokai. But there is a hotel/condo next door, so I would avoid anything below the 6 th or 7th floor.    Tower 1 Courtyard. These rooms have odd numbers from 01 to 23. The units face the other tower, but a slight turn to the right from your lanai and you see the ocean and Lanai. Warning, these rooms get the full afternoon sun, so bear that in mind.    Tower 2 Courtyard. These rooms are even numbered from 52 to 74. They face Tower 1, the pool and Molokai. The units in the 52 - 60 range will also give you a view of Black Rock. These are our personal favorite rooms due to the lack of afternoon sun.    Tower 2 Whalers Village side. These rooms are odd numbered from 51 to 73. They face Whalers Village and Molokai. They are generally considered the least desirable if noise from Whalers Village is a concern. Like Tower 1, go for the higher floors so that the Village doesn't block your view. Some of these rooms on the low floors may not have an ocean view (disclosure, I have never been in one of units on this side).    Finally, ADA and handicap access. The Whaler is very accessible. The lobby is at ground level with no steps or stairs. Access from the lobby to the Towers is likewise level. Almost all doors are motion sensored, so that helps too. There are several handicapped parking spots in the underground parking, and ramps up to the doors into the towers. The courtyard is also ADA-compliant, and there is a ramp down to the walkway and beach. The only place that is not wheelchair friendly is the doors at the end of each hallway. The first floor hallway is above ground level at the beach end, and requires navigating about 10 steps. Mobility devices will need to use the doors by the elevators, centrally located on each floor.    We have been there twice, and if/when we go back the Whaler will be on the short/short/short list of places considered.",Aug 2016,July 2016,Traveled with family,See my detailed review. Not all rooms are created equal !,"Bowling Green, KY"
400613641,40,Great Location - Very comfortable,"This is not a hotel. It is a condominium with hardly any shared facilities beyond a smallish pool and a towel service by the beach.    Yet this shouldn't put you off. The location is perfect, it is truly on the beach, the apartments are very comfortable and the service is prompt and efficient. This is the review:    1. Location: Right in the middle of Kaanapali Beach and you can walk to the shopping area next door in 2 minutes, and access all of the restaurants on the promenade by the beach. You are also 10' by car (and you should have a rental car in Maui) from the malls with its supermarkets and other amenities, and also very close to the little and charming town of Lahani where you can find lots of restaurants, outlets for shopping, etc.    2. Rooms: The units are very comfortable and include a well appointed kitchen. Ample cupboards. Good toilette and a large flat TV screen with dozens of cable channels. Bedding is also great. The units have their own private internet moden so wifi is of very good quality.    3. Facilities: Not much. There is no restaurant or cafe but you won't need one as there are many cafes and shops and restaurants right next at the Whaler mall. There is an underground carpark where you can keep your car at no extra cost.    I would highly recommend it because of the location, comfort and quality of the rooms.",Aug 2016,July 2016,Traveled with family,,"Sydney, Australia"
400410668,50,Our Maui Home,"We love The Whaler for many reasons. The location can't be beat. The staff are friendly and keep the property in top shape. Easy access to Whaler's Village and local restaurants. The corner units with the wrap-around lanais are the best! The units vary in age so you need to look at each one and find the one that has the decor and amenities you like. Some have a washer and dryer in the unit. Parking under the building keeps the car nice and cool. Only downside is that the rooms facing the courtyard lack privacy while enjoying the lanai if that matters to you. Try to look at the lanai photos to be shore you like the view. If the unit lacks photos form the lanai, it likely means you have a view of the roof of the hotel next door or Whaler's village. Another thing to watch for is the lanais for the upper level rooms on the southwest side of tower 2 by whalers village can get a little smoky due to the restaurant exhausts. It can limit the ability to open up the units and make sitting on the lanai a bit annoying. The pros-awesome views and privacy-outweigh the cons for us though. All-in-all, to us, the Whaler seems to be the best value for the location and amenities.",Aug 2016,July 2016,Traveled with family,We prefer any of the upper level corners.,"Devon, Pennsylvania"

The room was comfortable, it was quiet and was situated perfectly close to the beach and the Whalers Village. My husband thought the beach was pretty epic, he loved riding the waves.

395589387,40,Nice Anniversary,"We had a nice 2nd anniversary at the Whaler. Our travel agent booked this for us and she did a great job. During our planning we looked at Sugar Beach Resorts in Kihei, so glad we didn't. We were so happy to be staying at the Whaler in Kaanapali. This place is a great location for traveling to Napili and Lahaina. There are no restaurants on property but it is next to Whalers Village that have restaurants, shopping and a food court. The restaurants at Whalers are expensive. We opted to go to Napili, Lahaina or Kihei to eat dinner.    Pool: They have a beautiful pool but it's overfilled which does not make it user friendly for anyone under 6'. We tried to go in the 5' section and felt like we would drown because it's more like 6'. Looking down from our balcony everyone crowds the steps because it's overfilled and that's a big disappointment. Not a great pool for the kids or adults under 6'. Chairs were always available but watch out for the old timers that line up at 7:30am to get their umbrella and chairs.    Groceries: We got a shopper card for Safeway and it saved us over $40 but this place is nuts. We compared prices and drove to Times in Napili and it was a lot nicer and less crowded.    Rooms: We got a premier studio with Aston. We had a very nice upgraded room with an ocean view. We would definitely recommend booking thru Aston as opposed to VRBO. With Aston, you don't know what your room will look like but if something is wrong with the room they will take care of it immediately. However with VRBO, you get what you get. If the air doesn't work or there is a problem you have to deal with the owner and you never know how that will go. Also with Aston, they put bed bug covers on the mattresses. This is a HUGE plus for us because that's the first thing I always check for.    Staff: The staff is very friendly. Nathan the bellman and Mimi at concierge were so helpful and kind to us. James from the Pool and Beach Staff was one of the hardest workers; getting chairs, chasing umbrellas and making your afternoon relaxing. We enjoyed meeting Joel who also works at Cheeseburger In Paradise. If you have a problem with your internet or cable ask for Joel.    Complimentary: in the lobby and by the pool they always supplied complimentary Ice water, Crystal Light Lemonade. This was nice on those hot days.    We would definitely recommend Aston at the Whaler.",Jul 2016,July 2016,Traveled as a couple,,"Cincinnati, Ohio"

The hotel also includes free parking which is so helpful if you have a rental car. If you want to drink at dinner there's lots of restaurants within walking distance and it's only $11 for an uber into Lahaina.

384667862,50,Wonderful Return Visit to Whaler,"We last visited The Whaler in 1996. Twenty years later it does not disappoint. They say you can't go home again, but we did!  On our last trip, we stayed in unit 865, on the south side of Tower 2. This time, due to the construction on the Whaler's Village, we requested a garden view unit elsewhere. We had a unit on the 4th floor of Tower One, facing the Black Rock. The view could have been a bit more scenic. The remodeled lanai was nice, though.  The unit was in good shape, the kitchen has recently been remodeled with stainless steel appliances.  Always liked the bathrooms, with the separate vanity and loads of storage in the walk-in closet. We could unpack and really feel at home.  New this visit were the gym and spa. Did not use the spa services, but the gym was perfectly fine.  Now, all that being said...I do have to report that my husband and I were very disappointed that the poolside chairs get very crowded very quickly. Many people come down to the pool at 8 am, throw their towels on a chair, and then return several hours later to occupy the chair. There are signs posted that clearly state that lounge chairs may not be reserved for longer than 30 minutes.    Still and all, looking forward to our next visit.

383317295,40,Excellent location (once the construction is done),"We stayed in 2 Ocean View 1 bedroom condos 1069 and 669.    Both rooms had a wall of mirrors which I hated- between that and the mirrors around the rooms I felt like I was in Vegas sometimes with reflections of reflections. Room 669 was nicely upgraded, definitely the nicer room, but room 1069 had a spectacular view of the ocean and beach.    The construction going on at The Whaler was unbearable at times. Very loud, very early. I don't know when it should be completed but it looks like they have months to go. Probably only a problem in Tower 2.    Service was mostly awesome.    At check in I asked about where the construction was because I had seen it mentioned on a facebook post and the lady checking us in feigned confusion, she said there is no construction, LOL, as if she did not notice the gaping hole and heavy duty equipment running 8 plus hours a day. I would have preferred an honest approach. Besides that issue though she was super friendly and helpful in getting us checked in (Early!) and telling us about the area.    On our final day there my husband had to print a bunch of school work for my daughter and he was upset about the fees in the business center. The man at the front desk remained calm and polite even though my hubby was complaining loudly about paying $7.50 to print some documents, I was impressed and appreciated his handling of the situation.    We also had a situation with missing money and the hotel security and manager were excellent in handling that as well.    $16/day resort fee, it seems everybody charges these fees these days, because they can.    Shopping carts in the garage were great for bringing up groceries. I also saw bicycles, beach toys, sand toys.

379803856,40,Lovely homely apartment in fantastic beach location,"Stayed here in a one bedroom apartment recently with three friends on a girls vacation. Lovely clean, spacious apartment. Bedding configuration was one (massive) king bed, a pull-out murphy bed and a sofa bed. Ample space for four adult females, even with sharing one bathroom there was ample vanity bench space so we could all get ready whilst others showered etc. Lovely furnishings in beach style and it was clear the owners care for their space. Kitchen with massive fridge, microwave and oven. Facilities are great too. We had massages the day we arrived and whilst we didn't use the service, the spa offer a moonlight beach massage in the evenings which sounded fantastic. The grounds are lovely and we were very taken by the koi pond and feeding. Right on the beach - the location and views couldn't possibly be any better. The only concern we had was the noise restriction... we had to sign a waiver to state no excessive noise after 10pm. As adults on a non-partying holiday, this didn't concern us. However we did have a co-guest tell us to stop giggling when we returned to our room at night and we felt this was a little excessive that we aren't allowed to laugh on vacation!

378748599,50,Kaanapali Beach Vacation,"We stayed at ""The Whaler"" Condo on Kaanapali Beach where all the action, shopping and fun restaurants are located. There is so much available you don't even need a car! But if you do have a car there is plenty more to do on this island.    The 5 mile Beach Walk at Kaanapali Beach is safe to stroll at any time day or night and even the kids can adventure to other Hotels and enjoy the surroundings. If you eat at either the Hula Grill or Leilani's at the Whaler's Village... save your receipt for the next time you eat there and receive either a free Hula Pie or huge Ice Cream Sandwich! Both deserts feed two or more people. And the offer never expires - if you don't use it the first time, save it for another trip sometime later. They accept these even as 8+ years old!    There are plenty of Catamarans that you can board right from the beach also (Trilogy, Hula Girl, etc.). We happen to like both very much and also the Alii Nui Appetizer Sunset cruise that provides free transportation (go ahead and drink a lot, it's included with the ride!) and enough appetizers that you won't need dinner.    The best all day Catamaran ride is: The Trilogy ride over to Lanai.    The best Luau is: Old Lahaina Luau.    The best show is: Elvis in Burn'n Love at the Lahaina Theatre.    For the best food: Go to Mama's Fish House, or if you have a party of four try the sampler dinner at Merriman's Seafood Restaurant.    Whatever... there is so much to do that you'll want to come back again to enjoy your favorite adventures and explore new exciting adventures again and again.    Note: The Whaler's Rooms facing the inside court between the 2 Condo's from floor 3 and above, or anything on the 8th floor to the 12th floors facing outside is great!

376751081,40,Quiet condo in a great location.,"We booked a 5-night stay at The Whaler through Costco. Our trip was from 5/17-5/22. We ended up in Tower 1 (black rock side) in room 211 which is facing Tower 2. This was a 1-bedroom, 2-bathroom oceanview room. There were 4 of us traveling, including a 16yr old and 3yr old.    Booking, the Costco package which included airfare, car rental, and lodging was a great value - far better than anything else we could find on the web. I am a former travel agent so I know a bit about booking travel and this was a great value. There were no issues with any of our reservations as everything was in order.    This was our first time staying at The Whaler, but I had read the reviews and heard from a co-worker that it was a great property. It certainly did not disappoint.    Our room was clean, well-maintained, and fairly modern.    Services: Daily maid service (cleaning, towels, load dishwasher, etc..) was included and they also replenished coffee and bathroom products daily. Free WiFi was also included and use of the phone as well for local calls. Room had full cable television in both the living room and bedroom.    Room: Full kitchen complete with all appliances including a diswasher. Toaster, blender, and coffee maker also included. Cabinets stocked with dishes, utensils, etc... Spacious living room and lanai, with plenty of seating. Beach chairs were available in our room. Large sofa bed in living room and very spacious closet and master bedroom. The room was also stocked with games, books, and magazines. Bathroom had hair dryer also. Overall, the room was very comfortable and worked really well for our family.    Property: Laundry and trash were available on each floor near the elevators. On site parking was below the property in the garage with in/out privileges included - when the garage was full there is additional parking in another lot. The garage also has shopping carts available for hauling groceries up to your room, nice touch! Parking is included with your resort fee of $16/day. On-site business center. Heated pool, jacuzzi, dry sauna, and fitness center. Each tower also has a group of 3 gas bbq grills that are very well maintained. We cooked several meals on these grills and enjoyed the patio area they are located at. Great place to enjoy a few drinks and have dinner. There is also a small shack near the pool for getting towels and renting other beach items.    Beach: The beach is simply beautiful and is well located. You can snorkel right in front of the property or walk to Black Rock for even better snorkeling.    Tips:  1. Walk to the far side of Black Rock to snorkel. The beach here is far less crowded, the surf is calmer, and the snorkeling is just as good. Great idea especially if you have little ones with you or just want some privacy.    2. The shore break in front of The Whaler can be a bit rough at times. Be careful with little ones. We saw several adults get rolled unexpectedly by big waves.    3. There is no room service, bar, or dining on site. If you don't want to pay the high Maui prices in nearby Whaler's village - make sure you hit up Costco for beverages prior to check-in or stop by Safeway in Lahaina for food/drink. It will save you a bundle and it's very relaxing to sit on your lanai or the beach or by the pool and enjoy drinks that didn't break the bank.    4. Directly across from the entrance is a road that leads above the golf course. You can walk or drive up there, but at the top is a little shopping complex complete with a general store, some dining, and also The Snorkel Store. CJ's Deli there offers a great breakfast and also a packed lunch for the road to Hana. The Snorkel Store is great for weekly rentals of gear. $15/week for a snorkel set, etc... they also are great for booking other trips and just general info on where to go, what to do.",May 2016,May 2016,Traveled with family,"For Tower 2, a room on the courtyard side.

375300248,40,"A perennial favorite, but ask about construction before booking.","This oceanfront condominium complex centrally located in the Kaanapali resort, next to Whalers village shopping Center, has been a favorite of ours for over 20 years. The one bedroom units are spacious, the views from the forward units are outstanding, and the views from the further back units are still very nice if you are on an upper floor. The studios are a significant improvement on the basic hotel room, with a full kitchen. The spacious lanais add an extra living space to all floorplans. On site spa, activity desk and beach cabana or rentals are available, and a small but adequate workout roomis included in the resort fee.    The key to this facility is location. You will be seven minute walk from world-class snorkeling at Blackrock, steps from the soft white sand beaches, and a two minute walk from shopping immediately next-door at the Whalers village. Multiple restaurant are available up-and-down the Kaanapali beach walk, and a Roy's at the country club in the resort. Lahaina is a seven minute drive.    As in all ""Condotels""-- facilities in which the units are individually owned and therefore variable in appointments--you will run probably run the ""room gauntlet"" upon checking in, so I highly advise asking to see you you were assigned room first and be polite but firm if the unit or view is not up to your standards. This applies to all condo resorts, by no means unique to this facility .    The oceanfront pool is minimalist, small for the size of the facility and shade can be at premium at times, so get your towels out early. Gas-fired barbecues are available at oceanfront, are a nice feature. Free laundry is another nice feature.    Comparing, Kaanapali to other west Maui resorts, it was developed earlier (1970s) so you have multistory buildings that are closer to the beach than the more environmentally correct newer developments at Wailea and Kapalua. While this might at first consideration seem a disadvantage, views from the higher units are better, and there is immediate access to the beach from the hotel pool and grounds compared to the newer facilities which are low rise and farther back from the shore. The larger facilities result in a bustling beach walk, which can be viewed her as an advantage or disadvantage depending on your taste.    ALERT: If you're planning your trip in the next several months, check with the facility regarding construction. We were not apprised of the fact that they are installing rooftop solar panels, and the noise in the upper floors and inner units can be significant. We insisted on an outer facing unit, and were not particularly bothered by the noise except one day.    All in all, this remains one of my favorite places to stay on Maui. If you have a larger group, If you have a larger group, the Kaanapali Alii-- just a few facilities down the Beachwalk -- is outstanding but pricey.",May 2016,May 2016,Traveled as a couple,"Ask to see your room first, request upper floor and forward unit.","San Diego, California"

371954001,40,Here's the deal with the different towers/rooms and beware of construction!,"This is my second review of the The Whaler, so obviously it was good enough to book it again two years later. My first review in a nutshell said that every room is different - these are individual condo units, NOT standardized hotel rooms - and to keep that gamble in mind when you book, especially if it's during a busy time where you might not be able to move rooms. This review is more focused on what's currently going on to help people who may be booking in the near future, along with a breakdown of the towers and rooms. Still a 4 star review and my preferred place to stay while on Kaanapali, but there are some things you need to know.    First, a rundown on the rooms:    If you're booking directly through The Whaler, you have the option to book a regular room or a ""premium"" room. The premium category means the room has been updated. The first time we reserved a regular room and it turned out okay out of sheer luck (our traveling companions were not so lucky and got a room right out of the 1970s), but this time we booked a premium room and the difference is notable. The kitchen, carpet, tile, bathroom, bedroom - everything is modern and beautiful. If you can swing it, reserve a premium room.    There are two towers at The Whaler. Tower 2 is next to Whaler Village and Tower 1 is across from it (Google the property map for this property to see a visual). Both towers have two sides with rooms available on both.    Tower 2, facing Whaler Village: DO NOT stay in a room in Tower 2 facing Whaler Village until the massive construction project at Whaler Village is finished. It is a significant, loud, not-so-pretty undertaking and you don't want to look at it every day off of your balcony. Even if Whaler Village isn't under construction, I would personally not stay on this side. I imagine the noise and smells from Hula Grill and Leilani's (restaurants) get old really quickly.    Tower 2, facing the inner courtyard: These rooms are okay; they have a view of Tower 1 across a large courtyard and also of Blackrock. These balconies stay shady which is not my favorite because I like to sunbathe on the lanai, but some people may like that. If this is for you, try to get a room as far down (closest to the ocean) as possible.    Tower 1, facing the inner courtyard: This is where our room was the first time we visited and we liked it. It has a view of Tower 2 and of the ocean (not Blackrock though). This is the ""sunny side"" and the balconies get a lot of sunshine during the day, which is great not only for sunbathing but also for drying out wetsuits and snorkeling / diving gear.    Tower 1, facing Blackrock: This is where our room was the second time and, in my opinion, this is the absolute best side IF you get a room on a high floor (above floor 6 or 7, I would say). There is another condo building next to Tower 1 that is shorter so if you get a lower room on this side, you'll have a partial view of the ocean and partial view of this building and its residents on their lanais. If you get a higher room on this side though, the view of Blackrock and all of Kaanapali Beach is unmatched and it's high enough to be above the shorter building next to it. Obviously the farther down your room is (closer to the ocean), the better the view.    The next question is obviously, ""How do I get the room I want?"" Well, there are no guarantees. What I did is request a high floor in Tower 1 facing Blackrock, both when I booked the reservation months out and also when I called the front desk a week before our check-in date to confirm. Both times I was told, ""Sure, no problem."" Then we had a series of events which caused us to end up on Kaanapali a day early, and when I called to see if this could be accommodated I was told that we were assigned a room in Tower 1 facing the inner courtyard. (This was cheerfully corrected by Rod at the front desk, but I would have been disappointed to show up and have a courtyard room when we requested something else). They obviously assign rooms a few days ahead of time so if this is very important to you, stay on it and CALL a few days out to see what room you're tentatively assigned to. You can look at the property map to see where your room is located.    Okay, now other important things for people who may be booking trips in the near future:    To start with, when we were on Maui in November 2014, there was construction right outside Tower 1 of The Whaler. I wanted to avoid this the second time around so when I booked, I specifically asked about construction. The reservation specialist told me they would be installing solar panels on the roof but that there would be ""no real noise"" associated with it.    Now, I don't know anything about solar panels. Logically I should have questioned this, but she sounded like it was an answer she got regularly and knew what she was talking about. (As a sidenote, she did NOT readily volunteer that Whaler Village is undergoing a massive construction project and Tower 2 which faces it would be noisy. I had to learn that for myself from TripAdvisor reviews before calling to book.) I should also point out that when you call the 1-800 number for reservations, it goes to a call center that handles bookings for several resorts in this area. I really should have just called The Whaler's front desk and booked directly through them, which I believe is an option.    Lo and behold, we arrived at The Whaler and it turns out solar panel installation is INCREDIBLY NOISY. (Duh!) Our room was on the 11th floor out of 12 floors total and it was so loud we could barely hear each other speak. We attempted to switch rooms and tried the 9th floor in Tower 2 (still super noisy) and finally, reluctantly, a non-premium room on the 2nd floor in Tower 2 with a significantly lesser view. The construction noise was still present but bearable from the 2nd floor, but the room was outdated and the view wasn't good so we decided to grin and bear it on the 11th floor in our original room in Tower 1. (There was literally a waiting list for switching rooms beyond those two.)    The lesson here is to call the front desk directly to inquire about potential construction noise during your stay. When I told the front desk that the representative on the phone said there was ""no real noise"" associated with solar panel installation, they were understandably incredulous. How could there not be? It's my fault for not questioning this more. DO NOT make this mistake!    Moving on to a significant bright side - in my last review, the only sour note was that the attitude of the front desk staff was lacking. This was totally not the case this time and they actually went out of their way to try to help us move rooms to avoid the noise. Rod especially was fantastic - someone give that man a raise!!! Seriously, we came into Kaanapali a day early and he managed to find us an updated room on very short notice. He remembered us when we checked in and went above and beyond to try to find us a suitable room when we thought we would try to switch due to noise. It *REALLY* helps when the staff has a good attitude when things are less than ideal, so that was very much appreciated and helped start our vacation off on the right foot.    Finally, a note about our particular room - Room #1112 is awesome. A few minor things were wrong, like a noisy fridge that runs loudly and the sealing on the sliding glass door being a bit loose, but besides that it's a fantastic and upgraded unit. It's also up for sale (and has been for two years, as of this review), so you can see the pictures yourself by googling the unit number. Actually, once you find out what room number you're assigned to a few days out you may be able to find another TripAdvisor review or sale listing where there are pictures of it, so that's useful as well.    Hopefully this information helps someone, even though I know it's long. I am someone who digs really deep into reviews before booking so I hope this is appreciated by those like-minded people. :)",May 2016,May 2016,Traveled as a couple,Best rooms are in Tower 1 facing Blackrock and worst rooms are in Tower 2 facing Whaler Village...,United States

363048062,50,PERFECT location - GREAT views- The heart of Kaanapali Beach,"I have been staying at the Whaler for 20 years and I always come back. It's one of my favorite locations because it is on Kaanapali Beach ( the best 3 mile beach in Maui IMO).  The views are unforgettable and the climate is usually perfect. Many people think the Wailea is the best spot because the fancy hotels are on Wailea but it has never appealed to me- and I can be a travel snob. Wailea is very expensive and it rains more on that side. It just doesn't have the right ""vibe"". I always visit that side for a day of shopping or dinner but always stay in Kaanapali or Kapalua.  The Whaler remains a favorite for these reasons: it is a very short walk to the shops and restaurants, you can see black rock and other amazing views, it is on one of the best beaches in the world and has a golf course across the street. I have stayed at hotels on Kaanapali and loved them all but the Whaler is my favorite. If you are looking for a resort- this may not be your best choice as there is no room and pool service. I just love the idea of having my own kitchen and the peace and quiet without the resort fees and resort hustle.",Apr 2016,July 2015,Traveled solo,west building top floor,"Dallas, Texas"

We had our 2 children 7 and 10 with us. It was nice to have the second beautiful bathroom. The lanai was huge. We had a gorgeous view of the ocean and the grounds. The lack of restaurant in the hotel was no problem, there are lots of close options. We had breakfast at the Westin each morning. The beach was a ton of fun, and the kids loved the pool. I would definitely return. The city of Lahaina is a short drive with even more food and shopping options.",Apr 2016,April 2016,Traveled with family,,

This condo is conveniently located on Kaanapali Beach walking distance to just about everything that you would want.

361522621,50,This is the best location on Maui!,"Just got back from 17 days on Maui, spent 14 days here at the Whaler. It shouldn't be called Aston at the Whaler though. It should just be called ""The Whaler""! Aston manages a very small portion of the rooms available for rent here, and many owners where either using their units or live in them as well.    Anyway, this place is the best! My wife and I stayed 2 nights at another resort before arriving, and 1 night after leaving. This place creates a warmth, friendly environment. Everyone is there to enjoy Hawaii, not try to show off a $500 swimsuit that they can't use to actually swim in (yes we heard a group of women bragging about that at another resort on this trip).    The location here is perfect, the people are friendly, and nothing is pretentious here. The shortest walk to the Whalers Village (of any property on the island) for shopping, dinning, and convenience items at the ABC store. Amazing snorkeling just a short walk down the beach at Black Rock.    They have Two Towers. Tower 1 and Tower 2. Tower 2 is the South tower, and I highly recommend getting a room in tower 2, facing North. You will wake up with views of Black Rock and Molokai to your left, and the Mountains with frequent amazing rainbows to your right! Looking to the left, we had amazing whale shows! If you are here December through March you should be amazed by how close they were! The best sunsets on Maui are from this area with the Sunset taking place between Molokai and Lanai, talk about a perfect picture!    Amazing kitchen with granite, stainless steel appliances, and all of the cooking tools you need or want. Very nice BBQ areas in front of both towers, and they seem to have made improvements to those areas each time I have visited.    Only downside to this place is that many of the best rooms get booked way in advance! My wife and I booked last year for next year already. We spoke with the owner of our unit about 2018, while were still in the unit, and were told sorry booked up already. So we booked for 2019.    This place is so great, my wife and I are really thinking about buying a unit in the TIO program they have. A full condo is too much for us, but the time interval options seem to be more than reasonable, especially compared to other time share programs near by, that we wouldn't want to be at anyway.",Apr 2016,March 2016,Traveled as a couple,Tower 2 (south tower) North Facing towards Black Rock!

360238934,50,Great Location,"The Whaler couldn't be better located - right on the beach, next to Whaler Village, steps from the barefoot bar at the Hula Grill. Pool could be bigger but still nice - we were there at Spring break and had no problem getting chairs at the pool.    Stayed at #1201 - beautiful condo - high end finishes, appliances. Top floor - ocean front - huge wraparound Lanai. Really a three bedroom when you count a converted Den - slept 6 of us very comfortably. Advertised at $1500 per night on VRBO - we kept watching it though, and it came down to a 'special offer' at $850 so we grabbed it.

359851843,30,No Frills Property,"I selected this property based on all the wonderful reviews. First let me just say, Maui is amazing. And you can't go wrong with any vacation here; we had a great time. However, hotel selection just depends on what type of experience you are looking for. I would rate this hotel and room as average, with gorgeous views. It is clean and would work well for an extended stay due to the standard sized kitchen and laundry facility. This property has no frills - limited courtesy beach chairs, one towel each for pool use, small pool, no ice maker. However, it does have internet and a gym. Unfortunately the location of our premium room was not good and I would only consider this hotel again if they disclose the room number/location when booking.    Upon arrival I found the lobby and common areas to be okay - clean, but slightly dated and somewhat weathered understanding the humidity is rough on everything. Once we got to our ""premium"" room, we found the room to be okay. However, the kitchen was fantastic and the bathroom was very nice (no separate toilet area). The bed was just okay; I could feel a few coils and I'm 130 lbs.    The room was located on the 5th floor in the left tower if you are facing the ocean - NOT recommended at all. We were right next to The Whalers Village, which was great, but our room faced the backside of the Village...and the LOUD generators. We booked a premium room with a partial ocean view (only visible from the balcony). We would of loved to hear the waves crashing, but couldn't since the generator was so loud. In calling the hotel, they were aware of the issue but had not disclosed this information to me earlier and there were no other rooms available.",Mar 2016,March 2016,Traveled as a couple,Room 561 was noisy,"Huntersville, North Carolina"

On the floor was a small laundry room guests could use at no charge. It felt like a hotel with a 24-hour front desk and a tour desk.

Also next to a lot of other restaurants and shopping. Resort fee only $15 and we didn't pay for parking.

The only negative thing I’d mention - if you are staying at the condo on ground floor you won't have enough privacy* - instead of opening curtains and enjoying Maui's great view, we had to close it all the time (our condo was just in front of the lobby). when we went to the reception and complained about that - all they’ve said is that this is how it is and there's nothing they can do about it, we can change the room and pay more….We were a bit disappointed because it didn't cross our minds that in our lovely condo in Maui we will find ourselves hiding behind the curtains and missing some privacy...",Mar 2016,May 2015,Traveled as a couple,,"Herzliya, Israel"

Our condo unit was nearly oceanfront...had a great view of the beach and the ocean. It was equipped with everything we needed, and the staff was terrific-helpful and friendly. And it was so centrally located to all the sights and activities. We actually stepped outside our condo onto the beach to board the whale-watching catamaran. We loved the place so much, we booked two weeks for January 2017 at The Whaler.

356374621,40,Very comfortable condo with marvelous views,"My husband and I are in our 60's so a lot of what people come to HI for are not part of our activities due to various health problems. We are not going to be hiking, nor surfing, nor zip lining, nor scuba diving, nor horseback riding, etc. We have to leave that to the young folks now. However, what we came to Maui for was to unwind, relax, de-tox, breathe deeply, get a huge dose of visual beauties, enjoy good fresh seafood, and live on ""island time"" for a while. We booked the Whaler because it's got a great location. We can walk to Whaler's Village or down to Black Rock or along the beach every day for a morning or sunset stroll. At the Whaler, we can stay on our balcony and enjoy the ocean view and spot whales all day long if we desire. Our one bedroom/one bath condo on the third floor suited us beautifully. It was clean, spacious, with updated kitchen, comfortable furniture, and just right for our purposes. The outdoor balcony is spacious and we spent a lot of time on it. The only reason I am not giving this property five stars is because it would be our desire to have Aston improve the landscaping and renovate the swimming pool area. In our opinion there should be more flowers or flowering trees/shrubs on the ample acreage available. The current plants are beautiful, certainly, but we just think there should be a much larger ""wow"" factor. We did find the staff always polite and friendly and our requests were carried out every time in a timely manner. We stayed during a time in which my birthday fell, and upon entering our condo, we were delighted to see a bottle of champagne/glasses and pineapple boats awaiting our arrival!

355380926,30,Very basic grounds and amenities,"The Whaler is a condo complex, so each individually owned condominium can vary in how it is appointed. My review is of the location and the ""resort"" amenities for the Whaler itself. IF you want to save money be doing a lot of your own cooking (and Maui prices are off the charts) then this might be the place for you. BUT be sure the location suits you. Ours was on bottom floor and had absolutely no view of anything except the shopping center next door. We did NOT want to eat any meals there. The grounds have not changed in over 20 years. The swimming pool is absolutely awful --a basic rectangle surrounded by concrete. Looks like a Motel 6 in Bakersfield or Oklahoma. Really? Come on Aston ! Put some money into this place. There are no pleasant seating areas for a glass of wine watching the sunset. No fire pit, etc. Nothing of interest for young ones. The pool services provide a towel and a short legged beach chair from 9 - 4. IF you want to sit on beach early for coffee or later for sunset --nothing. Need an umbrella for some shade (none at all on beach) They will RENT you one for $20. There are BBQ areas to cook in, but the newest one has only uncomfortable cement picnic tables on which to eat --no ambience at all --right by the freeway like walking path --windy/ sunny. It would have cost little or nothing to add an attractive fire pit with benches or even some kind of plants or ambience to the eating area. Most use only the BBQ and then take food inside. I personally did not want to eat in my dark condo when the lovely beach was right outside.  You should know that the units have windows on only one side --so depending on the direction, you may find them to be dark and dreary (we did).  The hallways look like something from 1970s (when this place was built)--some on Aston --put some $ into this place. Staff is very friendly and helpful. We decided that it was worth the extra $$ to stay at a nearby resort where the pools are huge with waterfalls, landscaping, plenty of seating, etc. Lovely places to sit in the evenings to look out at the ocean. I never saw an available seat near the Whaler pool (though I also don't know why someone would travel that far to sit by a boring pool staring at the side of a concrete building either) Not even sure one can see the ocean from the pool area. Yuck....  This place is in need of some significant money to be spent on the grounds and the ""resort"" amenities. Not worth the high prices as it is.",Mar 2016,March 2016,,,"Hilton Head, South Carolina"
354572448,20,Ocean view is more like Whaler village view,"We are currently staying at the Aston Whaler village. When we booked our package, we paid for an ocean view room. Well, they did give us an ocean view room.......which was all the way in the back with great views of Whaler village and the loading dock, and to one side is a sliver of the ocean. Technically, I guess there is an ocean view (more like a peek), but calling this room an ocean view room is absolutely misleading. We have asked the front desk to give us a better room and so far no luck. Be careful when you book here.",Mar 2016,March 2016,Traveled with family,,"Fremont, California"

354457028,50,Really Nice Condo,"Just got back from 5 days at the Whaler. We stayed on a recommendation from friends. We booked through the Aston and we were assigned unit 560. It was a super nice remodeled one bedroom condo with terrific water views and views of Black Rock. I know that condos can have different levels, we were lucky and got a great unit. It is a North facing unit which I would recommend as you have nice shade on your balcony.  Property and grounds were well maintained. Beach access is simple and the Whaler has chairs you can sign out at no charge. Lounge chairs and umbrellas were a charge of $20.  We didn't have problems getting a chair but were generally on the beach by 10.  The Whaler has nice stretch of beach, we noticed as you walked North to Black Rock the beach started to shrink to nothing, same to the south, keep that in mind when looking at a hotel/condo. Other nice thing about the Whaler is it's location to Whaler's Village with shopping and restaurants.

Steps from your room.  - Our room 1013 was very nice. Well decorated, spacious, everything we need to cook one or two meals a day.  - Almost every room has an ocean view, unless you are at the back of the building  - Grounds are clean are well cared for  - Great location..10 minutes from Lahina by car  - Next door to Whalers Village...Shopping and Groceries, special access for hotel guests  - Tons of Restaurant Options in walking distance (recommend early dining or dinner reservations, otherwise you may be in for at least an hour wait)  - Buses run frequently if you dont want to rent a car to get around  - Friendly Staff  - Great Whale Watching from Balcony or Beach  - Black Rock 5 minute walk to snorkel off the beach. Saw lots of fish and one Green Sea Turtle. We would have done more here but the surf was pretty rough during our stay. Best time to snorkel here is as soon as the sun hits the water. As more snorkelers arrive the turtles tend to leave i was told.    CONS...  - Small Pool, Chairs are packed in like sardines. If you are a pool person over a beach person, I wouldnt recommend this place.  - Small beach chairs are free (when available) lounge chairs, umberllas and cabana on the beach are not free and ridulously priced when you can go to Boss Froggs in Lahina and rent everything for a week that you would pay a day for at the Hotel.  I found this to be very annoying. If you have one of the smallest pools and pool areas on the island you think you would offer the chairs and umbrellas for free or a much lower cost. The koi fish have a bigger better pool that the humans!  - There are very few shade/umbrella options. Because the chairs are packed in so tight at the pool you cant turn your chair to follow or get away from the sun.  - It is stated you are not allowed to leave your chair for more than half an hour, in other words no saving chairs, but everyone does it.  - Major Renovations were occuring at the Whales Village and will be continuing for quite some time. So there is construction noise going on but it really wasnt that bad.

The staff was friendly and accommodating, the pool and the Jacuzzi were nice, and the small beach chairs were free from the guys in the pool shack. The washer and dryer were also free on each floor. The beach was beyond all my expectations and the photos don't do it justice. We could also see the Humpback whalers frolicking in the Pacific right from the beach!!!! Finally, the location right next to Whaler Village was great because the ABC store stocks everything you might need in a pinch and the little food court came in handy if we didn't want to splurge on an expensive meal.

The rooms themselves are owned by individuals and the hotel managed by Aston. Our room was tastefully, if generically, decorated in Hawain theme. Bed was ultra-comfortable. Bathroom was a bit dated. Everything worked in the kitchen unlike what we heard during checkout from another couple whose dishwasher didn't work, and who had only one working burner on their stove. In conversation with another couple in the (very nice) hot tub next to the pool, we learned thatthe maintenance of the individual units is highly variable so beware of getting a unit that the individual owners have not maintained (e.g., worn out furniture, unmaintained appliances).    There is no restaurant on the property but plenty of nearby restaurants. The pool and hot tub were convenient and beach side. The grounds were nice if not as luxurious as some of the nearby hotels. , The hotel is right next to the Whaler Village shops - convenient but our room overlooked the village which was having significant renovations that we could hear (too well) from our balcony in the day.    Despite the negatives noted above, our experience in conversing around the ool/hot tub suggested that this hotel gets a LOT of repeat business.

Yes, there was a bit of noise - both from the somewhat massive construction project going on at Whaler's Village, people sitting in the area outside the lobby talking loudly early in the morning (seriously, 530 am .... have a care), and - the worst from my perspective - a contractor cutting tile with a tile cutter next to our room (our furniture was vibrating). All of this was annoying and accounts for a not-perfect rating. But the upside is this: our room was massive (a king one bedroom) - enormous bathroom (yay - a hotel with a real counter in the bathroom!!) a very large sitting area and lanai and a very servicable kitchen (full sized frig, microwave, coffee maker). The property is right on the beach with a very nice pool and spa. It is mostly populated by older couples - with a few younger couples and young kids (but definitely skewed to the older crowd). So yes, a downside to be next to the construction project at Whaler Village but upside - steps away from good and relatively cheap eats. The concierge was very helpful. The front desk not so much - I wasn't even asked about my stay when I checked out (isn't that a given?). This property is perfect for a family or someone looking for more space at a much better dollar value than a hotel room. Yes, the amenities at the Hyatt down the boardwalk were amazing (beautiful grounds, sprawling pools, penguins ....) but heavily populated and high in traffic. The other benefit of the Whaler is its location near the best snorkeling beach (at the Sheraton) and close to several luaus. So while the noise was annoying, we used the money we saved to participate in some great outings (sunrise at Mount Haleakala followed by a (very wet) bike tour, whale watching on the Gemini, and just cruising the boardwalk for people and whale watching (yes, you don't have to go on a boat - you can see them just fine right from the beach!). And the other plus is you don't really need a car (though very helpful for stopping at Costco on the way over and stocking up on supplies).

Good amenities such as self service laundry on each floor (reasonable price too!), exercise room, decent parking, great green area between the buildings, pool is very nice too.    The Aston is located immediately next to Whaler Village and good dining. Beware that noise maybe a problem if you on are the south side of tower 1, or the tower closest to Whaler Village.

Mornings on this side of the building had some noise from delivery trucks and construction at Whalers Village but you did not hear it from inside. It wasn't loud enough to prevent us from enjoying coffee on the lanai most mornings. In the evenings the only noise was a low hum of air conditioners mixed with sounds of the surf coming in. Pool area was nice and not too crowded. Underground parking was plentiful with wide enough spaces. Outdoor grills are available. Location is close walking distance to everything you want to do on Kaanapali Beach and the Trolly and Bus stop next door at Whalers Village to get you to Lahaina or anywhere else you want to go.

Be careful of rooms that overlook the Whaler Shopping Center directly adjacent to this condo complex to the south. There's a fair amount of noise, including music, and sometimes you also get the smells from the nearby restaurants.

I'm sure is was a high end place at one time and still is nice but our condo filled all the needs but was a little dated. Most definitely affordable compared to a lot of the places. for example Bathroom was borderline a little icky. The furniture was oldish. Nice to have beach chairs and umbrella in the condo because otherwise you have to rent them on the beach. The pool was really small.

339939388,30,Great ocean view. Pool was disappointing.,"Stayed here for three nights in early December 2015. Booked into a premium two bedroom apartment.    The apartment itself exceeded expectations. The furniture and kitchen utensils were quite new. Everything was clean. The sofa and beds were very comfortable. The Ocean view was beautiful and worth the money in and of itself.    Facilities wise, there were plenty of parking spaces so finding one was not a problem there was also a tennis court which we did not use. The pool, however, was disappointing. Given the size of the development, the pool was very small and ended up being a kind of bath in which people sat in. It was impossible to swim in it.    A note on swimming: the waves along this part of the shore are very strong. I am a strong swimmer but found it quite hard going. We ended up walking all the way to the beach in front of the Sheraton where the waves were weaker.    I also used the business centre which was basically just a room with computers and a printer in it. Connection speed was decent. Printing was expensive but on par with hotels in big cities I suppose.    Service wise, there was one lady at the front who was strangely unhelpful. However, she seemed OK with other older, American patrons (I am Asian) . Otherwise, all the other members of staff were friendly and helpful.

Someone would come by to clean and do dishes for us everyday. I heard it's hit or miss because most of the condos are individually owned so do your research and make sure it's been renovated and is up to your standards before booking. Our room was renovated a year before we stayed and was excelent. I was very happy with the grounds and the staff. The staff was very friendly and helpful (which is what you want in hawaii!) The fitness center is small but works. The pool was ok but the beach is there so why bother with the pool. The area is nice. Whaler village nearby with small shopping and restaurants. We had a great time. Parking garage can be kind of difficult to get parking but we didn't go out too much and usually found a space.

It is very close to downtown Lahaina for more great food and shopping and groceries. The only gripe I have is that they charge for a lounge chair to use on the beach.

Love walking to Black Rock to snorkel early in the morning, then come back for breakfast on the balcony.  With no restaurants or shopping on site, there aren't a lot of people roaming the grounds keeping it relaxing and quiet. There is a shopping area right next door if shopping and dining are your interest. So convenient to walk over, shop, eat, people watch then come back to quiet.

Each unit is individually owned and maintained, so some are more up to date than others and if you book directly through the Whaler, you will not know which condo that you will stay in until you arrive. Our condo was on the 11th floor and was a bit outdated, however, it was clean and maintained and we loved the view! We stayed in tower 1, facing the Sheraton and heard their Luau each evening in our room, so id imagine it's even louder a few floors down. The other tower (2)- could have issues if facing the Whaler village due to noise and current construction. There are several restaurants and small stores in the area. For a large grocery order check out Safeway or Foodland in Lahaina, they both have store discount cards to save $. Try the fish tacos at Leilani's... Excellent! Many have also complained about the pool at the Whaler- we didn't travel to Maui to swim in the pool but there are certainly hotels with nicer pools in the area. Finally- there was a rather aggressive employee working at the pool area that you could totally see that she made commission.

329040124,50,Home away from home,"We spent a week at the Whaler. We had been there many times before, but it had been seven years since our prior visit. That visit had been scarred by the massive redo of the courtyard and pool area that went on. This time was quieter.    We had apartment 765 in Tower II. This, unfortunately, overlooks Whaler's Village. Two problems - noise from Whaler's Village, particularly music from Hula Grill, and the orientation is to the south, which makes it a lot hotter during the day. The good news was that this was the first time ever in the Whaler where we had a unit which had good, strong air conditioning. So if it got too hot or too noisy we could close the door and put the air on.    This apartment is considered 'premium'. I'm not sure why but it seemed a bit larger than other studios we have rented at the Whaler. The kitchen was all new with new appliances and was first rate. The apartment had obviously been renovated and was very nice. The bed was very comfortable and the furniture was also very nice. One oddity was that there were several sets of speakers but no stereo. Don't know what happened there. A flat screen TV is on the wall and can be angled around to see better depending where you sit. They have cable with a thousand channels. EXCELLENT free wi-fi.    The garage at the Whaler has been a problem for years, in that it floods when it rains. We had some rain this time and did not see any flooding, so I think they may have fixed it. Parking in the garage is very tight and it fills up by the end of the day.    There is a booth by the pool (we didn't use the pool) where you can pick up towels to use while swimming. You get cards from the front desk for towels, and exchange the card for a towel. Bring the towel back and get a card back. The towels were really, really nice. The booth also rents snorkel equipment, which we got, and it was first rate, much better than any we had before. Black Rock is still just a short walk away.    The outdoor parking lot has been expanded and we had to park there a couple of times when we got back fairly late at night.    The staff at the Whaler are very nice and accommodating.

Situated on a prime spot of a prime beach in Kaanapali that's perfect for swimming and nearby snorkeling, this is the place to go if your idea of a perfect Hawaiian vacation is a relaxing day in the sun. The pool, just steps from the sand, is nothing special compared to the mammoth mini water parks down the shore, but it satisfies. The courtyard and its koi pond are lovely, especially on a late night walk.    We made sure to get an updated unit as we were advised from reviews that not all the units here are up to par. Our studio room had a full kitchen with tasteful furniture, plenty of bathroom counter space and a gorgeous partial ocean view. We were able to enjoy money-saving home cooked meals looking out on Lanai from our lanai (it's fun to say that!). It also looked out on Whalers Village mall, which is nice in the afternoons when you can hear the live music, and not so nice in the early mornings when noisy trucks roll through making their deliveries. Request a north-facing room if you can. Our king size Murphy bed was surprisingly comfy and easily retractable, providing plenty of extra space during the day. Staff came to our room on our second night with champagne and chocolate mac nuts for our honeymoon, which was certainly appreciated.    The grounds show their age in some spots, including the 70s-era signage. The gym was closed for remodeling but the spartan sauna area was available. Pool did not have a bar, which is a pretty big strike for those who want the full trappings of a luxury vacation, but they did provide free poolside coffee and lemonade. You need a card to check out towels, which I found tedious. Being late October, the lobby and front desk were festooned with ugly and tacky Halloween decorations that spoiled the mood. The parking garage suffered a flooding issue and never had available spots late in the evening, prompting us to park in the hot sun of the tennis court lot.    Location is what makes the Whaler a winner. Black Rock and its snorkeling opportunities are a five-minute walk away, and you can rent a mask and fins from the Whaler pool for $35/week. Lahaina, the most fun town in Maui, is a ten-minute drive and perfect for an evening out after watching the extraordinary sunsets from the lanai or the Kaanapali Beach walk. Room rates are reasonable considering what you pay at neighboring properties, especially if you look for their online deals. The clientele for our mid-autumn stay consisted almost entirely of laid back and friendly retirees and some of their families, much more low key than the hopping mega resorts, which was ideal for a pair of honeymooners.",Nov 2015,October 2015,Traveled as a couple,Try to get a high floor.

325515889,50,Almost perfect!,"Stayed here for a week in November and loved it! We had a 1 bedroom 2 bath room and it was the perfect size. My husband is an early riser and I'm not so studios don't really work for us! Pretty sure there isn't one unit here that wouldn't have an ocean view, unless you were on the bottom floors. We started on the 12th floor in an end unit with an amazing wrap around lanai, we could see the ocean with a bit of Black Rock from one end and the mountains and golf courses from the other end! Unfortunately the bed in 1274 is not at all comfortable, after 4 nights we couldn't take it and moved to another room, no issues at the front desk regarding moving! Down one floor and MUCH closer to the beach, the complete view of Black Rock was great! Hubby really appreciated the DVR on the televisions, heaven forbid he misses a game while on vacation! The grounds are beautiful, the pool isn't spectacular but who cares when the beach is just steps away! If I was bringing the grandkids I would stay elsewhere though because of the pool, it's deep as soon as you step off the steps and NO flotation devices allowed! Having Coke products in the vending machines makes me very happy being the Diet Coke addict I am, so many hotels have Pepsi.  We did have a couples massage in the Hina Mana Spa downstairs, it was wonderful and decently priced but no windows which makes it kinda gloomy down there. We had a great time though and we'd definitely come back to the Whaler!",Nov 2015,November 2015,Traveled as a couple,,"Redondo, Washington"
321929362,50,Great location and wonderful units,My DH and I stayed in a 3rd floor studio unit for 11 days in September. We booked through VRBO for the savings and extra amenities.    I did a lot of research before booking as this was our Honeymoon and I wanted the best possible experience. We loved the location right on the beach and next to Whaler's Village. Our unit actually faced Whaler's Village but the the trees that line the property provide great privacy and wonderful bird watching.    We enjoyed the pool and appreciated the enforcement of the rules. We like kids but they can be no one wants to hear screaming kids when you're trying to relax.    The BBQ's on site were great and a perfect spot for enjoying a sunset dinner. Parking was a breeze and we only had to park outside once due to lack of space.    Overall it was a great trip and we are already talking about going back.,Oct 2015,September 2015,Traveled as a couple,,"Mississauga, Canada"
321771088,40,Your experience very much depends on the room you are allocated,"When I booked this (direct with Aston), I was told to request a high up room in tower 1 facing Black Rock. I rang them a few days before but got brushed off. We got the opposite - inwards facing room in tower 2 which luckily, wasn't that bad (see view from photo). So I guess they ignore your request if you are a first timer. It was a bit like that Hitchcock movie though, with everybody looking into each other's suites from the opposite tower. You could be allocated an awful room - say lower down on the outside of each tower, or out the back. There is construction going on in Whalers Village which would impact just about all the suites on the south side of tower 2. Booked a premium suite which was worth it. Very clean, with the added bonus of a washer/dryer. It would have been a nuisance using the ones by the lift. The BBQ's are great; stand there with a beer watching people wandering along the beachwalk, whilst doing your steak. The BBQ's at the back of tower 2 were much less crowded. Stock up on your supplies at Safeway in the Lahaina Cannery Mall, far cheaper than the ABC Stores. Memo to Aussies - get a Safeway Club card there and then, it will save you a fortune. Not much eating options outside Leilanis and the Hula Grill (unless you like expensive resort food). It was hard getting a lounger in the shade by the pool, most of them are claimed early on (despite the no reservation policy). Kapalua Beach much better for snorkelling (you can get a bus if you don't have a car).

Pool is deep so not ideal for 5 year old and the pool staff actually said they cater for retirees not families basically saying they don't want kids! Weird comments. Apart from that the whole area is fantastic with plenty of options for dinners around. Shopping at outlets is good about a 10 min drive away. Defiantly would return to this paradise.

I've stayed in several, and seen many, but that one is always my favorite, fully remodeled and overlooking black rock. Stunning!

317571800,50,"Sand, Sun and Surf","The Aston Whaler is one of the best hotel/condo complexes on the west side of Maui. Its location is right on Kaanapali beach close to shopping, entertainment, and restaurants ranging from fast food to fine dining. The beach itself is one of the better ones on Maui and the surf is friendly with clear water and gentle currents. Having been to Maui a few times before and done the sight seeing trips we decided not to rent a car this time and it worked out just fine. We took a flat rate cab from and to the airport and either walked or took the local bus to a few restaurants, some shopping areas and the Maui Ocean Centre. By my calculations I saved CDN $1,000 not going the rental car route for our 2 week stay.  The Aston Whaler is clean, well maintained, with friendly staff and while the ""lobby"" is minimalistic compared to other hotels on the strip, it's functional and the grounds are picturesque. We rented a 2 bedroom ocean front condo in Tower 1 with a fully equipped kitchen and everything in perfect working order. Unlike some other AC systems the ones in the Whaler are simple and work very well. Set the desired temperature and it runs automatically. Push one button to turn it off. Done. No complicated settings or manual required. While there was no washer/dryer in the unit there is a laundry station on each floor by the elevators.  The pool area is very small compared to the other hotels in the area and finding a good spot to sit out for the day is tough but then you can rent a few chairs and an umbrella and sit on the beach so not a major concern.  Having visited the other hotels during our stay and seeing the crowds and the set back locations of these facilities I would always opt for staying at the Whaler with it's excellent location, fully equipped kitchens and easy access to the beach.  One caution however. The Whaler has 2 towers and we stayed in Tower 1 in an even numbered unit with an unobstructed view towards Napili. The unit had a wrap around lani but unfortunately the building next door has a roof mounted AC unit that was extremely noisy making it unpleasant to use that part of the lani facing the other building. So we were confined to the front facing part of the lani only which was not ideal but workable for us having an ocean front unit but other people in units on this side of the building could not retreat from the noise which ran 24/7 if they wanted to use their patio area and I heard many people complain about this noise pollution.",Oct 2015,September 2015,Traveled as a couple,I would avoid even numbered units in Tower 1 especially on the higher floors.,"Surrey, Canada"

317099497,50,A hotel that is the heart of aloha,"I lived in Hawaii during high school and returned for a reunion. I was the organizer and was the one who suggested Ka'anapali and The Whaler as our base. It's quite developed and touristy, but it has one of the best beaches in the world, gorgeous views of Molokai and Lanai, and if it's sunny anywhere, it's here. I hadn't stayed at The Whaler before but the Group Sales staff were terrific to work with and things sounded as though they'd be just what we needed. I was absolutely right. From the minute we arrived through the last morning, the entire staff exceeded all my expectations. When they say you have an ocean view, it's not the sliver you can see as you lean over the balcony! Need an extra day after all? They jump through hoops you didn't dare hope for. The crowning moment? Dear housekeeping staff Vilma who already was wonderful left every penny of the hundreds of dollars of Reunion funds in cash I mistakenly left on my coffee table in my rush to hit the beach. I will sing this hotel's praises for a long long time. Don't worry if you can only get a garden view room. It will be lovely too. And you are next door to Whalers Village, a touristy mini mall where you can get what you left at home, and good food in different price ranges. You can avoid it if you want.

We reserved our rooms in February and got a premiere oceanfront 2 bedroom and 2 bath. We specified we had 3 adults and 3 children. They said we had a room with a king 2 Queens and a pullout couch. We got room 852 which is oceanfront but not conducive for children at all. It didn't have a pull out couch or a nice couch at all. I went down to ask about moving and was told they don't control many units because the owners rent out their own units and that the manager wouldn't be available until Tuesday this was on Saturday 😳. I asked for a free rollaway since 1 child had no place to sleep which they did send up to us. Then I was told unit 852 didn't want kids in the unit are you kidding me you knew we had 3 kids and the kitchen table was only for 4 people so we couldn't all eat together. The master bath is huge with a big bathtub but the spare bathroom is tiny especially for 4 people.  Then the pool does not like kids you can not have any water toys or balls and we were told this is an Aston rule set for all their resorts. You have to have a towel card which if you loose you will owe $25 dollars.

Their excuse was that they did not know we had checked in. This was a grave mistake on their part as we had checked in for 1.5 hours before the incident had happened.  The housekeeping manager mentioned that she would speak to the front desk manager Wendell Inamasu regarding compensation to us about this incident. We did not hear from Judy or Wendell during our 3 day stay there. When we checked out, we were told that Wendell Inamasu would contact us.

First was with the Pride of Maui Crew out to Molokini crater and Turtle Town. Breathtaking, amazing, beautiful, beyond my wildest dreams experience ever. The water, the clarity, the habitat was stunning. The crew on the boat, outstanding, attentive, informative and fabulous customer service from the moment of pick up to drop off. More food then one could eat, even though some tried their hardest to eat it all, lol.... They offered Snuba - I almost did it - but backed out.    Second Trip was on Trilogy Elua and their Crew - the boat was a catamaran so we powdered out and sailed back in - exciting, thrilling, and amazing. This trip took us to Honolau Bay - moray eels, moorish idols, big fish the kind you wish you could catch when fishing big...lol... and the lovely adorable turtles of all sizes. As a marine hobbyist and the love of the ocean, I look at the rocks, corals, along with looking for the not so obvious things - like the tangs - watching them do their tang thing is so cute, spotting a coral crap, admiring the massive sizes of these corals. Spotting hawk fishes perched, seeing a goat fish searching for food in the sand. On our second spot to the other cove from Honolau Bay thats when I said I have to do something before a regret occurs. I SNUBA, Michael on Trilogy was outstanding - patient, understanding, informative and a great tour. OMG i will Snuba overtime and I recommend it - what freedom. To actually dive down and see the turtles sleeping was breathtaking, so get up close and personal magnificent. Brandon was a young man on the crew who did it all, service, attentive to ones needs, the spotter in the water - the captain (who I think I saw later in the evening on front street) was an outstanding Sailor as comedian when explaining all the rules and regulations. There were 2 other crew members whom I didn't get a chance to speak too but without them it would have been impossible to have had a great trip.

The grounds were immaculate, the elevators were never jammed up, the pool was great and the views, oh, the views. We just didn't know where to look. The views were fantastic. The parking was almost always available in the garage. Occasionally chairs around the pool were saved all day with towels, never to be used by the actual person. But that isn't the fault of the resort, but the ignorance of the guests. How do you control that? The staff was always helpful and the concierge, Povi, guided us through many available trips we wanted to take and steered us in the right direction. She was super helpful.  Now the negative, sorry. I rented this unit through VRBO. The owner was odd to deal with and at one point after I had my very large deposit check cashed she sent me an e-mail asking if I was still interested in booking. What?? To say this made me uneasy is an understatement. The benefit of booking through this site was being able to choose the unit. My sister however, had a wonderful experience. She stayed in unit 1101. Fantastic! I almost wish I didn't have another unit to compare with but.... since I do... Unit 1212 has horrible pots and pans, very little silverware, one iced tea glass and a few plastic cups. There are tons of wine glasses and margarita glasses though. ??? There is a washer and dryer in this unit, that was great to have. The bed was a king and topped with a 4 inch memory foam topper. It was like sleeping in a sauna. These things are known to hold heat and it sure did. Ugh. Other than these few negatives, our stay was fantastic. If the owner would spend just a little money on utensils, pots and pans, a new mattress and some glasses, it would be pretty darned near perfect. So, they were more annoyances than negatives. Again, if I didn't have anything to compare it to, I might not have even mentioned it. So, book 1101 instead of 1212. The views are both fantastic, they have the same staff, same elevators, same parking and same wonderful resort. I would have been willing to pay a bit more for these extras.  All of this and within walking distance to tons of local restaurants. Not to mention the Whaler Village where we could go to the ABC store for odds and ends.

It took 2 days to get the shower transfer bench I asked for. The resort is not very handicapped friendly, as you have to go down a steep ramp to get anywhere else like Whaler's village.

Great view of the water and mountain,the central garden and lawn.  Our room had a double living space, first area: large living room with kitchen, second area: separate bedroom and good size bathroom.  Noise control great, as all guests must keep outside noise down after 10 pm, so no issues of loud guests partying on the balconies.  Very pleasant place to stay and very close to the Whaler Village which had shops and a ABC store for your shopping needs. A larger shopping complex located within ten minutes drive either side of the area.  Note: Some rooms in the complex are single rooms, with bed and lounge area in the one area, smaller kitchen and bathroom but these are at a lower cost.  Highly recommend this place and our room.

We have been to Maui 4 or 5 times but this was our first time at the Aston Whaler, and we were pleasantly surprised. The condo unit was clean and spacious, and the kitchen was fully furnished. We were told that we would have a ""garden view"", but we actually could see the water quite well from our room and balcony, and if we opened the slider, we could hear the waves!! It was also nice for us that there weren't a lot of young children, so the property, pool and rooms were nice and quiet for us older folks. The staff were helpful and friendly and took care of any minor issues right away. We were also located right off of the elevators and had easy access to them and to the laundry facilities. We went with our friends and she is disabled, so the rooms were very accommodating for us. We would definitely consider staying there again!

304548305,40,Almost perfect,"First off, I like to note my 4 star review is for the hotel itself. The unit we stayed in was 5 stars. This is important since the differences between the units can vary so much. We stayed in unit #624 in north tower (tower 1 I believe) which we booked through Flipkey but property was managed by Whalers Realty Management Co.    As for the unit itself, it was clean, exactly as advertised with newer kitchen, wrap around lanai giving you partial views of the ocean and the mountains simultaneously, plenty of space with 2 sofa beds in the living room area besides the big master bedroom. The unit had all the basic amenities such as iron, hair dryers, plenty of towels, bedsheets, pillows and blankets but also had in unit washer/dryer which was incredibly convenient to have. The unit even came with a mid-stay cleaning where they provided new bath towels and replenished the toilet paper and paper towels.    Next section is the review for the hotel itself:  First the good:  - wow, the location. it's been touted in previous reviews but it is so convenient. Having  Whaler's Village being so close meant you always had ample dining choices, nightly entertainment (free luau + shopping), and an ABC store to get basic grocery items. It's also a 5 minute walk over to the Black Rock.  - Unlike some previous reviews, parking was plenty and on the few days we got stuck with parking outside, the lot is right next to north tower so there is very little difference.  - Pool towels can be readily exchanged  - The grounds, koi ponds and fountains match that of ""resorts"", including a nice small lobby and free refreshments.    Now the not so good:  - Pool: I didn't think this would bother me so much but with smaller children, the pool  was essentially not an option. It's essentially just an apartment community pool, with just the shallowest being 3' and most parts deeper. Luckily my kids including myself preferred playing in the ocean but it would have been nice to also have the pool as an option. This is where you really miss the ""resort"" feeling.    Overall I would highly recommend this place, especially our unit, but just have to set expectations of the ""condo"" feel vs. resort, and of course all the amenities of a condo like having your own kitchen and in unit washer/dryer, etc.",Aug 2015,August 2015,Traveled with family,,"Seattle, Washington"

We were a party of 3 (mom, dad, 13 yr old boy). It was very comfortable even with the sofa bed pulled out. Large kitchen (for a 1 bedroom) and we actually had an ocean view, despite the name. We were on 4th floor overlooking Whaler's village and had no problem with noise, etc. However any lower and probably would have had issues with noise and view. Pool is perfect for 13 yr old, but maybe not for kids 10 and under since most of pool is 5 ft deep+. Ocean right in front is great for body surfing, boogie boarding and the reef is not bad for snorkeling. Short 10 min walk to Black Rock for better snorkeling. Tons of restaurants/shopping right next door. Staff was very nice, we had issue w/TV and they came right up and took care of it (I believe it was ""operator error"" on our part :). Grounds on Whaler property are beautiful and even my son had fun feeding the koi at 8:30 some of the mornings.

We were able to make a trip to the grocery store then make breakfast and lunch in the condo.  I picked the ""ocean view"" option and was not disappointed. You'd have to pay an arm and a leg for ""ocean front,"" so ocean view was a nice compromise. We were on the 11th floor, facing north. Could see the ocean and hear the waves at night! We also had a nice view of a nearby golf course.  Being able to walk right out onto Kaanapali beach, and up to Black Rock, was wonderful. We did some snorkeling at Black Rock, even saw a giant sea turtle swimming up to the beach. The beach in front of the resort was not crowded at all.

It's good value for money in comparison to other establishments, if a lack of amenities of the ones I mention below don't bother you, then it's a great hotel to stay in. The nearby restaurants weren't suitable for breakfast so we took a trip to the local supermarket, which is good for those who are health conscious and want to prepare their own meals.

The Whaler Village next door had lots of places to eat and was a short bus ride to Lahaina for even more food options. Staff were helpful and friendly and allowed us to check in early. The only disappointment was that when we initially arrived and went to the room we had been allocated it was on the worst side of the resort out of the four sides and our room overlooked the service buildings of the shopping village next door and you could hear the motors running in the room with the door closed. We went back to reception and said that we were not happy with the room, the staff member immediately gave us another room that overlooked the garden and the beach, it was a lovely room. I just wonder at how they make their decisions on room allocation, how do they decide who gets the mediocre room and who gets the fabulous room? If you stay there check the room map at reception and if you are on the Whaler Village side you may want to discuss a room change.

Overall, the property had the feel of a tired retirement community. It started with the service at the front desk. The person behind the desk was more interested in doing something in the back office instead of waiting to greet new customers. It took a little time before we were helped then eventually received our room keys. The electronic door mechanism didn't work with the keys and had to go around to the side of the building to enter. Then we heard the elevators were broke the day before, but worked fine during our stay. The door lock on our room door was also faulty...had to turn the knob from the indie to engage the lock and the bolt. Same with the bathroom door. The bed was horrible, unless you like a hard bed. The next morning we woke up to find our coffee pot didn't work. Housekeeping brought another coffee pot and let themselves into the room after only two knocks and me shouting I was on my way (fell back to sleep).

My wife made dinner 3 times out of the 8 nights and we saved some $$. The bed was comfortable, the wi-fi speed was amazing. Each room has its own wi-fi router. Access to the beach was great. There is a nice, warm jacuzzi downstairs with the swimming pool. My only complaints are: 1) Everyday the housekeeping would load the dishes in the dishwasher but never unload them. So, by our last day, most of our dishes and utensils were in the dishwasher. 2) The guy at the counter wasn't the friendliest person you would ever meet, and 3) they charge 45$ for 2 chairs and an umbrella if you want to sit on the Kanaapali beach (for 8 hours). I thought that should be free for guests staying at the Whaler (or atleast discounted).

In reality, my husband and I are truly ""pleasantly surprised"" because the view we have is a big condominium building, nor can we see the sunset. When we asked the front desk where the full view of the ocean was and complained we couldn't see the sunset at all....they were not helpful and we were told for another 2000.00+ US. Dollars we could have what we wanted...a view of the ocean and be able to watch the sunset! So my advice is do not believe the reservation department of the Aston at the Whaler in Kanaapali.

286129238,40,"Great location, a couple things to note (room 813 studio ocean view)","As long as you know what you're getting ahead of time this property should not disappoint. We have stayed in Maui at resorts several times in the past but prices were sky high the week we went (6/25 - 7/4) so we decided to go with the Whaler.    THE GOOD:  -The location of the Whaler is perfect - right on the beach and next door to lots of shopping and restaurants.  -Price: we spent less than half of what most resorts were going for per night.  -Pool rules: no pool toys whatsoever allowed in the pool - so if you have a floating device for your toddler or infant it can't be in the pool. This made several parents angry as the policy was unexpected. We don't have children so I listed it in the ""good"" section.  -View from room 813 was great. Also, some of the pics online for the unit are outdated. This unit has been upgraded since then and features granite counters, new shower, etc.    THE BAD:  We thought we rented through the Whaler directly, but our unit (813) was managed by Monte Fitts. This isn't a big deal if everything goes smooth, but if you have any issues as we did it is very difficult to get a resolution. We didn't know we did not have a daily cleaning service. We were there 8 nights and did not receive service once. We ran out of shampoo and asked the front desk if they had extra. They said no because the property wasn't managed by them. The communication between Monte Fitts and the whaler front desk was abysmal. I had a guaranteed late checkout when I booked but the whaler had no notes of that. When I said there was a miscommunication the Front desk at the Whaler said it's not their problem because they don't manage the unit i'm in. Long story short I spent 2 hours on the last day of our vacation tracking down Monte Fitz personnel and getting the Whaler to honor my late checkout. To be fair to Monte Fitz, the problem was with the Whaler staff, not Monte.  -Pool temp was really warm, almost like taking a bath....  -No food/drink service on property. I have no idea why the whaler doesn't want to make a boatload off of overcharging for food and drinks like every other property. We ended up walking to the Tiki Bar at the Kaanapali beach hotel several days for lunch.  -Towel game: It's played here often. The worst part is many people who reserved prime spots didn't show up all day long. I understand going to grab lunch or breakfast or a swim in the ocean for 30 mins or an hour, but anyone who is not at their chair for hours at a time should have their towels removed by staff.    Overall this place is pretty much what we thought. Decent place, so-so pool, great view, no services at all on property but half the price of the resorts.

We ran into a man delivering pineapples in the hall several days after we arrived and asked who got them and said everyone when they arrived. None were ever placed in our room.

These are condos that are either owner occupied or rented. Accommodations are spacious. We had an efficiency and it included a fully stocked galley kitchen, fridge, microwave, stove and dishwasher. We had ample dining space and storage closets, however, it was badly in need of updating. The TV was at least 20 years old, and with flat screens so reasonably priced, switching out the TV so one could actually see it would be a cheap fix. Its proximity to the whaler village and quite a few dining spots make this property a desirable one. 2 small thing truly rubbed me the wrong way.

283670337,50,Great hotel on Kaanapali Beach!!,"Full kitchen is nice if you want to save a bit on your vacation food costs. There aren't many inexpensive restaurants on Maui, expect to pay 2x. The Whaler has large beautiful coy ponds and gardens in between the two towers, that receive many hours of maintenance daily. We had a 9th floor room on the north side of Tower 1 (north tower) with a great view of Black Rock. Even rooms on the garden side of the towers have a good view of the ocean, but you probably want to be on Floors 6-12 to have the best views. There are 3 Studio rooms, grouped together, on each floor, on each side of each tower. They are located half way back on each floor, from the beach. The 4 rooms on the beach end of each tower are: Tower 1- Rm #1(1B2B), Rm#2(2B2B); Tower 2- Rm#51(1B2B), Rm#52(2B2B). The Whaler is convenient to nearby Kaanapali restaurants, but if you're planning daily sightseeing, a rental car is almost a necessity. We had a car for the 9 days in Maui and put 600 miles on it.

282632138,50,Loved it at first sight!,"We stayed in Room 902 at The Whaler in Tower 1. It was absolutely beautiful and was so much more than we expected. It was beautifully decorated, had the most incredible deck on two sides for wonderful views, huge and beautiful master bathroom and all around was just lovely. We booked through Kay at www.Mauikay.com and she was so helpful and made sure we were taken care of throughout our entire trip. We loved being right on the beach, but at the end that was not as crazy in the evenings, so we could just enjoy the deck and the barbeque on the BBQs that the resort has on site. We traveled as a family with 3 teenage boys and they also had a great time (and that is saying a lot with teenagers ;)), but it would be a wonderful place to spend time as a couple as well. The concierge helped us with several activities we decided to add at the last minute such as surf lessons and golf. I can't say enough about how much we loved our accomodations and the services of www.MauiKay.com.

It was very spacious and had a full kitchen and the balcony was huge! The location on Kaanapali beach is perfect - there's an ABC store and fun bars like Hula Grill and Leilani's just steps away, and the beach out front is lovely. There are sunset cruises that depart right from the beach that you walk out onto, so activities are right at your footsteps. The staff here was very friendly and accommodating as well. Our flight to Maui had been cancelled so we didn't get in until much later, but the staff was very generous and gave us a late check-out time.

281040993,40,Great place to stay,"We stayed for 6 days and overall it was a lovely stay. Clean, quiet room and right on the beach. My only real issue would be with a couple of the front desk staff. Their attitude was borderline rude and we felt like a hindrance. They would talk to us like we knew everything about the resort when in fact this was our first visit. For instance we had never heard of towel cards before staying here and she just rushed through the process of what to do.

281036653,50,Our Maui Dream Realized,"Our family of four stayed in a Premium One Bedroom, Two Bathroom Ocean View Condo. We booked almost a year earlier so our excitement for the trip built throughout the subsequent months. We looked frequently at photos on the website and I hoped that the actual room would match those images. When we opened the door of 1160, I was happy to see my family rush into the room with excitement. The view from the balcony was fabulous! The beach and ocean! The Black Rock point! Molokai! And the condo itself was wonderful as well.  The main bedroom was spacious with its own access to the balcony. Plenty of closet space and a large bathroom were also nice. There was a reasonably comfortable pull-out bed in the living room. Both rooms had television with DVD players and quality cable. A second bathroom, a dining area, and a full kitchen finish the living space. The WiFi at the property was quite slow but free.  Overall, the property was beautiful. Between the two towers of condominiums lay a beautiful garden space with a Koi pond. The lawn, flowers, trees, and pond were maintained daily. By the way, the Koi were huge! The brief walk from our tower entrance to the beach led right through this delightful garden. The pool was sizable and sufficient for the number of people using it. The pool area was not adorned or cleverly designed, but then there was the Pacific Ocean only a few yards away. A beach walkway stretched in both directions beyond the property, running past neighboring properties and the Whaler's Village shopping area. Vendors for watersports could be found along the beach area. Various levels of eateries are also immediately available, though the food court is far more affordable if you are on a tight budget. I recommend stocking the kitchen and eating in when you can. Going to and from the building is not a hassle so it is easy to sunbathe, eat, then return to the beach or pool. There are no restaurants on the actual property. There is a secure parking garage, although it does cost about $12 per night.  The Aston at the Whaler has an in-house concierge who can make arrangements for activities. While this is helpful, be sure to speak up if you are looking to save money. Most of the activities are pricey. Also be warned that Maui Jetski takes reservations but also accepts walk-ups. Your one hour excursion can turn out to be significantly longer if the barge-bound staff decide, as they did with us, that they are going to give priority to the large group that might walk up with wallets bared. But enough about that!  The staff at Aston at the Whaler were generally friendly, although I wouldn't say that they did anything extraordinary. They did exactly what was expected of a high-end establishment. The front desk staff were very welcoming, as was the concierge. The housekeeping staff were mostly pleasant but some of the facility staff were virtually silent when we greeted them.  My wife and I repeatedly stated our pleasure with the Whaler. We would most certainly return. We recommend it but save room for us!",Jun 2015,June 2015,Traveled with family,High rooms close to the sea have the best views.

Check in staff was friendly & helpful.  My husband & son were playing catch on the grass field by the pool and the staff told them to get off, no playing on the grass. The man was abrupt & rude. The pool staff removed our towels and items that were on the pool lounge chairs a few times. There is a rule you cannot save chairs for more than 30min which is fine, but this was 15min mid afternoon when we ran up to the room to make lunch. We went and talked to the man who was walking around doing this and he just shrugged his shoulders.  They charge $25-50 day to use a beach chair on the beach. This is very disappointing as we stayed at another property owned by this same chain last year on this beach & they did not charge. So it was unexpected. Overall not friendly staff.

The apartment was at the far end of the building, but there was still quite a nice view to the see (“partial see view”).    Next to Aston Whalers is a shopping center Whaler`s Village. It has an ABC shop and a full range of other shops, mainly clothing. About 10 min away by car is a bigger supermarket.    Rental car is a must have and can be parked in the garage.    There was a cleaning lady coming daily and washing machines for clothes on the corridor. Wi-Fi worked well.

274040194,40,Great Vacation Despite Gliches,"Our 7th visit to the Whaler started off rocky as they did not have the room location that we had requested 9 months earlier. While an excuse was given that the detailed info was not in the computer, it seemed strange that they had us in the right tower, just on the wrong side as it was completely occupied....they seemed to know that too. We've always stayed on the south side of Tower II, and the Manager had to step in to resolve the issue. The almost hour-long check-in ordeal was not what we were looking for after a long trip from the East Coast, but in the end they made us happy and our week on Maui was off and running.    We love the condo's at the Whaler as I love to cook. The outdoor grills are great and meticulously maintained, and our kitchen was adequately stocked with cookware, dishes, glasses, and cups. The view of Lanai from our room's lanai is breathtaking and we look forward to it every time. Also the smells and sounds from Whalers Village and the Hula Grill/Barefoot Bar right next door keep us smiling the entire time. We stayed in an Premier (upgraded) studio and it was beautiful!!!! Granite counter tops, new cabinets, and new bathroom with a very sexy shower were the highlights. The bed slept great and the linens were of first class quality. Really, this hotel/condo is a great place to stay while on Maui as access to Black Rock and the beach in general is fabulous, and with Whalers Village right next door, you can have your vacation anyway you'd like.    The grounds of the Whaler are stunning in their beauty and simplicity, and the extra-clean pool area is the center of the daily social scene of live-ins and visitors alike. This is the only place we stay while on Maui and our latest visit did not change our minds. But, with the reservation issues mentioned above, and the fact that the we reacted negatively to the toiletries from China, we could only give it a 'very good' rating instead of the 'excellent' that we would have loved to give.

Much better than the horrible pictures many have posted on trip advisor. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Location ideal with direct beach access. View was fantastic. Negatives are 1) parking underground is limited and you will be charged $12 to park in a lot not directly under the building. 2) each unit has its own undividual owner so upkeep and unit probably not consistent. I would stay at the same unit but don't know about the other units. 3) nothing that you expect on a hotel price his range on site for example restaurants or concierge.

I've stayed at many other properties on Maui, and none of them have the location for fun in the Ocean, one of the perennial ""Best Beaches in the World"" (it's won the title of best 2 times in the past 10 years, and always in the top 10).    Great kitchen and in room laundry in the unit we rented save a lot of money, along with the nice Stainless Grills in front of each tower make it hard to go wrong.    A 500 yard walk down the beach to some of the best snorkeling in Maui at Black Rock. Lots of fish, turtles, coral, and we even saw Spinner Dolphins this year!    The whales playing in ocean with great views from our room, as The Whaler has the closest average distance of it's rooms to the Ocean.

The location is great and beach is fabulous. Nice grounds pool & grills.  After about four days of our stay we realized the condition of this room which is 107, was definitely unlike most of the other units in the building. TIP......find out when updates have been made to any unit.  Dishes were dirty in the cupboards due to the dishwasher not cleaning them properly. So we were left to washing our own by hand and rewashing dishes in a single sink that was so old the disposal & drain smelled. Bath tub drain fixtures broken so no baths could be taken. Cracked sinks, pealing wallpaper, dirty patio blinds with so many holes in them in the morning it looked like stars shining through. The glass on the patio door is off the frame and needs to be replaced. There were countless other things but none that you would be able to see in a photo. We did not contact housekeeping as we felt it was not in there job description to remodel & update. Needless to say this was not the ""Hawaiian "" vacation we anticipated. There are many beautiful units & we dearly wished we were in one of those we had seen. The only good thing was the location of this unit to the beach . We knew we signed an agreement & we didn't have any other place to go and extra money as we paid thousands of dollars for 8 nights.

261328472,50,Outstanding!,"Cannot imagine a more perfect place to stay on Maui than The Whaler on Kaanapali Beach. Perfect location - beautiful, extremely well maintained, manicured property. Thought it was much more beautiful than it shows up in photos on website. This is smack dab in middle of Kaanapali Beach - rated on the Maui travel channel as the #1 beach in Maui. Paved walkway all along Kaanapali Beach leads to restaurants, shopping and other beach front hotels/properties. Whaler Village shopping center is next door.    We booked a ten night stay through the Aston at the Whaler on Kaanapali website. Looked into renting directly from condo owners but rates were good on website and cancellation policy MUCH better. We found owners slow at responding to questions which was frustrating. Only disadvantage we saw to booking through Whaler direct is that you do not know exact unit you will get until check in. (Maybe if know one you want can request - do not know) We did know we would have an oceanfront, and called ahead to request an upper floor. We could not have been more pleased with our unit.    We had a 1 bedroom, 2 bath oceanfront unit - and it was OCEANFRONT - 8th floor corner unit with amazing views in all directions - Black rock to the north; islands of Molokai and Lanai directly out front and beach towards Lahaina to south. Beach view and West Maui mountains views gorgeous from oceanfront corner unit. We were happy just sitting on balcony. Perfect sunset views. We constantly saw whales out in water - such fun! Also, some very large turtles.    The condo was beautifully decorated and totally up to date. Two flat screen televisions - one over 70"". Good wi fi service. Kitchen had everything needed except for the food. So nice to be able to cook breakfast or light meal when staying that long. Maid service was daily - do not believe this is case when rent directly from some of the owners. Our unit had washer and dryer. There is a washer and dryer on every floor for units that do not have them. Bell service is available. Fast elevators and garage parking. $12 per day for parking.    Were able to book tours and get good info at the Activity Desk in the lobby. All staff very friendly and helpful.

The Aston is located right beside the Whalers village with some great restaurants like the Hula Grill amongst others. Make sure that you request a courtyard view which has the bonus of facing the ocean as well. The pool is a nice size and towels are provided.

We didn't spend much time at the condo due to island adventures. We did use the pool a couple times, pool was the only negative aspect for it closed down very early. We utilized the kitchen well for our week visit to cut costs. The beach here is fantastic soft sand. Whale tours are available couple hundred yards down the beach. There is a nice bike path leading both directions from the hotel if biking is your flavor. Minutes to Lahaina the location is great. Look online for condo rentals to find the best deals.

Views from our lanai were spectacular and we could see whales each day. Our room was a studio with ample space, fully stocked galley kitchen and dining area, and more than enough closet and drawer space. However fixtures were out of date. TV was at least 20 years old, and a 32"" flatscreen would have been a cheap update. Many of the condos are owner owned and occupied, and updated premium condos are not made available to travel agents. Although the room was cleaned each day, the bedding was only changed once during our stay. My biggest complaints center around nickel and diming us. We were charged $12 per day for parking, and there is a $12.50 per day charge to rent a lounge chair for the beach. Really!!! Annoying when paying $300+ per night. Convenient access to Whaler Village shopping center, and dining is a definite plus.

258857141,40,First trip to Whaler,"My wife and I recently stayed at the The Whaler on Kaanapali Beach Hotel for four nights in February 2015. We booked a garden view 1bedroom, 1 bath through Pleasant Holidays. It is the practice of the Whaler not to assign suites until shortly before your arrival. I had requested that we be on a upper floor and in tower one. Our other request was not to be facing the Whaler Village shopping area. When I contacted the hotel two days before our arrival, I was told that we were assigned suite #269 on the second floor facing the Whaler Village in tower two. I asked if they considered my request and we were told that they were fully booked and that was the only suite that was available at that time. We were given the choice to upgrade to a partial ocean view for an additional $100 per night. We decide to wait and check out the original unit to see if it was to our liking. It turned out that the unit looked directly at the Whaler Village and all one could see from the lanai was a small area of grass and a row of trees that tried to hide the buildings in the shopping center. We spent one night in the unit and could not sleep because of the loud AC units on the roofs of the village buildings. The next day I complained to the management and they were able to upgrade us into a partial ocean view 1 bedroom 2 bath suite #474 that was only two floors above us and facing the inside garden of the hotel looking over the roof of the lobby. The unit's furnishings were much nicer and the view was better but not worth the extra $100 per night. I later found out that the garden view rooms are only at the front part of the hotel and on floors 1,2,& 3. All other units are considered ocean views. Pleasant Holidays and the Whaler never made us aware of this fact before we booked. We ended spending close to $500 per night with the upgrade. If this fact was known ahead of time, I would have probably picked a different resort. To reserve a specific unit, I would suggest booking through VRBO or a local rental agency since they deal with the owners of the individual units.  On a positive note, the Whaler at Kaanapali Beach is a nice resort and we enjoyed our time at the property. The grounds are well maintained and the swimming pool area is nice but small when compared to other properties in that area. The resort is quiet and the location is ideal since it is on the beach and next door to the Whaler Village shops and restaurants.",Mar 2015,February 2015,Traveled as a couple,,"San Martin, Ca"

253907126,40,Overall a nice place to stay,"We rented a timeshare at this resort in Maui and found our unit to be reasonable for the price.    Finding the resort was a bit tricky using our vehicle GPS, as it made us go to the end of the drive to where the Sheraton is and then head in the opposite direction. We learned that once you pass the Whaler's Village, the resort entrance is 2 entrances after that. Just have to watch for the sign and turn in at the split in the road meridian.    Drive through the parking lot security hut (wave to the friendly attendant) and keeping straight until the left curve, will bring you to the 30 minute check-in parking spots. We arrived earlier than the check in time, and the staff was accommodating. After registering, they directed us to the parking underground and advised us if we came in late in the evening and found no empty lots down there that there were lots available outside behind tower 2.    Our timeshare was clean and nicely decorated, with a semi-ocean view of Black Rock. We kept our windows open overnight to listen to the crash of the waves on the beach. The courtyard has a small waterfall with colourful fish in it. The pool area is not huge but does have a waterfall and whirlpool. It was never over-crowded. Access to the beach is easy from the lounge and pool areas.    The location of this resort is very close to the Whaler's Village, for shopping, restaurants and snacks. This was very convenient to us. From the resort, we went along the beachwalk either north towards the Sheraton and to the other side of Black Rock, or south along Kaanapali beach.    2 miles south from this resort is the town of Lahaina where we were able to go shopping as well as walk along the Front street main centre. Using our rental vehicle, we went to the town to get groceries at Foodland and Safeway stores. Prepared meats we purchased were barbequed on the resort's BBQs behind Tower 1. These BBQs were really convenient, and are kept clean for guests.    We needed a couple of extra days beyond our timeshare and the resort's bell desk attendant, Nathan, helped transfer some of our other items to our new suite. Nathan's professional and courteous demeanor was very assuring to my wife and I. Our suite was on the main level and had a newer décor. Most likely it was part of the resort's recent multi-million dollar upgrade.    Overall, our time on this resort was memorable. It is clean, well kept and has a great location on Kaanapali beach.

I phoned and Wendell apologized, and then credited my Visa the amount of the room in US dollars. This was a month after my trip, and the exchange rate to Canadian dollars was worse by then, so I got credited less than what was originally debited. I politely asked if they would refund that but he refused to reply. I figured I'd just suck it up, until I saw the interest that they charged me on that, which was triple the original amount. Not my fault obviously, so I contacted Wendell again and he again refused to reply. This is such a big stress on what was such a nice holiday.

250716321,40,"Absolute minimum handicapped accessability allowed by law, minimal parking","There are exactly 8 handicapped spaces out of 359 which is the absolute minimum allowed by law. Dozens of parking spaces are occupied by owners' cars that are in long term storage, that is covered with car covers that have thick coats of dirt and leaves. The above ground spaces are not lighted which is a bit scary because when we went over to Ruby's Diner next door we saw it boarded up with plywood because of a burglary.    If you need handicapped parking, you are pretty much up the proverbial creek without a paddle. If you need parking after about 3pm and certainly after 6 pm, you are graciously allowed to park in the 30 min check-in spaces, the loading dock or the driveway to the front desk. But don't get too smug, you need move your vehicle by 630 am, which is before sunrise. So you can park in the dark, walk back to your unit in the dark, walk back to your car in the dark and be prepared to go get an early breakfast somewhere while you wait for a parking space to open up. If you want to go out for dinner, you are pretty much restricted to walking to the adjacent Whaler's Village because if you move your car, you will not find a parking space when you get back. Or rather you will only get a parking space you must vacate before dawn, so early to bed, early to rise, late to bed, early to rise.    You can get security to walk you to or from your car in the dark, but remember Hawaii runs on island time, so be prepared to wait a New York hour.    If it weren't for horrendous parking problem I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this property. If you are handicapped you couldn't do worse. If you are security conscious, make sure they have put in parking and walkway lights or be prepared to wait for security escorts.

250094348,40,First time in Hawaii - Great place to stay!,"First off Hawaii is Beautiful!    We were there for 1 week visiting family who rent a condo at the Whaler. It was my wife and I and our 3 year old son.    The grounds at the Whaler are well maintained. There is a coy fish pond in the middle of the resort and at 8:30 am they bring out fish feed for people to feed the fish. Our 3 year old son loved that.    Our room was one big room with a king sized bed. We had a small kitchen with all the necessities. There was a nice bathroom and a walk-in closet. We had a small round dining table and a flat screen television with all the channels and free Wifi. I do admit our room was a bit dated but it was cleaned every day. Our view from the balcony was poor. It look directly at another hotel!    The price for our room was around $400 a night. The price hardly reflected the value in my opinion, but it is Hawaii!    The beach was awesome with the exception of some locals who were loud on the beach and would throw sand at each other and mud wrestle together.    Be prepared to pay for everything! Beach loungers and chairs are all at a cost! Go buy a coupled cheap fold up chairs and save the $$.    We ate all our breakfast in the room. Went out for lunch 4 times and for dinner 4 times at various locations. The bus into town is $4 for an all day pass. We visited town 3-4 times during our weeks stay.    There was a nice pool and hot tub. There were very nice barbecues residents could use on location.    My In-Laws had a rented a condo there for 3 weeks so we got to see their room. They had a 1 bedroom apartment. Nice size kitchen, Living room with pull out couch and flat screen T.V, 2 bathrooms, master bedroom with a king sized bed and television and massive closet space. Washer and Dryer located in the master bathroom. They had a big balcony and a nice ocean view. It was also slightly dated but still very nice.    Overall I found the resort very nice. The snorkelling is awesome! We seen a sea turtle twice and the whale watching was a bonus. The views are beautiful and Maui is a very attractive place to visit! The resort is low key and quiet. It's a different class of people unlike all inclusive resorts with drunk patrons and swim up bars.",Jan 2015,January 2015,Traveled with family,Try and get a room on the end for an ocean view or inside room.

249801791,40,Dissapointed,"What has happened to the best condo building on Kaanapali Beach??? The parking is frustrating if not impossible!  The washers for the guests on at least 4 and 5 have been out of commission for at least 10 days-totally unacceptable!!! The people we are renting from in 408 with a spectacular view and quite the nice condo deem their washer and dryer so sacred that it is locked up in a closet! Really for what we are paying this is disgusting. The Hyatt just opened new residences that are amazing and even though we have stayed here for years we are tired of looking for a parking place, going to several different floors to do laundry and just generally being disillusioned while on a months vacation. Our money can certainly be better spent somewhere else. Especially when the help goes well just use the washer on other floors!!!! REALLY and to whoever owns this condo I am impressed that you charge this much money in advance and think your laundry should be off limits. We have money to spend and it won't be spent here again.

Concierge, Povi Larsen, was very helpful in helping us select day tours that we wanted to take. Fortunately we made arrangements several months in advance so we were able to get the tours and dates that we wanted. Our daughter reserved a 2 bedroom, 2 bath suite but when we arrived at the Whaler, they upgraded us to a Premium 2bed/2 bath suite.

Our room was gorgeous and spacious, we booked a studio garden view and ended up on the 2nd floor of Tower 2. We loved having the kitchen for morning eggs and bacon, and extra closet space to get our spread on. We only booked a garden view but had a nice view of the water from the balcony. We loved the location of the hotel: We were on the beach within 50 steps of the door which made for easy morning snorkeling down the beach at Black Rock, afternoon chilling on the sand and late night jumps in the waves (one of our favorite activities). Also directly next door to the hotel is Whaler's Village where we had many beverages followed by many frivolous purchases at the shops. We thought the hotel pool was nice and the water was the perfect temperature, plus great uninterrupted sun for tanning and chilling out on a lounge chair (for free. Only complaint about this place is having to rent a beach chair. Pshh.)  Basically we are easy to please and we had a ball relaxing at The Whaler!

Did not receive 2 beds requested or high floor or full oceanview.  Housekeeping or turndown service left breads and cookies on the counter on a few evenings, nice gestures but ants ate them before we could enjoy them. The ants were extremely annoying.  On our 2nd and 3rd days there was no hot water.  On our 3rd night there was flooding in the garage causing no a/c and no hot water.  There were also loose carts about the garage. There's also not enough parking. On multiple nights we had to park away from our tower to the overflow parking.  Room decor was too much. In the bathroom, a giant vase takes up one-third of the counter space. In the dining area, a large garish chandelier hangs over a tiny table.  Our floor had a set of washer/dryer near the elevator, but it was flooded with soapy water.  The Whaler has no restaurant on site.

248307297,30,Needs renovation,"We recently spent our winter vacation in the Aston at The Whaler. First of all, it is known just as ""The Whaler"", nobody knows what Aston is there. The location is very convenient, just feet away from beautiful Kaanapali beach. The pool is tiny and they have a decent garden with a big koi fish pond. Every morning, at 8:30am they bring fish food so the kids can feed the kois. My daughter enjoyed it a lot, so I had to do it 6 times in a row. The pool is tiny and normally crowded. The hot tube is even more crowded. I did not even put a foot in it because I feel uncomfortable sharing a jacuzzi with 10 strangers. Our room was just OK. Clean, well equipped, but definitely worn. The furniture, decoration, everything, was from the 70s and I felt like living in American Hustle movie. Looks like the rooms are maintained by the owners, so probably it is a question of luck to get an updated one. Looks like I wasn't lucky. One of the best things was the WiFi. It was excellent and we could even stream Netflix without interruptions, so we were not so bored during the tropical storm. I still have an issue with my billing that needs to be corrected by The Whaler. They charged me 500 extra dollars that need to be returned, but I hope they will fix the issue soon. I will update this comment with the final resolution. So far, I am confident on them.",Jan 2015,January 2015,Traveled with family,,"Palo Alto, California"

The designer kitchen was efficient and fun to cook in. We could eat out on the lanai when we wanted a view, or read a book or lounge while enjoying views of Black Rock and Molokai Island.

There were minimal services in the hotel itself, but it is a great location; adjacent to the whaler shopping mall and the busses.    The hotel does not have a shuttle bus, but the local busses make it easy to get to a variety of locations.

247102435,50,Great value and location,"We were thrilled with our studio apartment and our stay at The Whaler.    The staff were very accommodating, right from the beginning. They allowed us full use of the resort even though we arrived before check-in. They also allowed us to use the resort the entire day we were leaving, as we had a very late flight. They were always able to answer our questions. The baggage attendant was particularly helpful!!    The Whaler is located directly beside Whaler's Village, a shopping complex with a few restaurants. Some of the shops here are very expensive. I definitely recommend venturing into Lahaina to view the stores and local artisans there.    Our room was cleaned everyday, which was fantastic! It was recently renovated, and very comfortable. The kitchen was well stocked. The view from our room (we were upgraded to a premier studio) was absolutely incredible. When we were in our room, we spent most of the time on our lanai!    The pool was nothing special, although it was located right on the beach. It is a fairly small pool, so chairs were sometimes an issue. There is a hut that you can rent snorkel gear from. Kaanapali Beach is incredible, so I definitely recommend that you snorkel. Black Rock is at the end of the beach and boasts an amazing variety of fish and aquatic life. We swam with a sea turtle here!    Just an FYI to parents: children are apparently not allowed to have any pool toys in the pool.

Our apartment was at the back of the building but had wrap around veranda's so we had both mountain and beach views - both of which were spectacular. The adjoining property of The Whalers Village allowed for easy shopping and meals without the need to get in a car. The local bus to nearby Lahania was easy to use and allowed us to get around without the need to hire a car. This is a resort for families and people who want to relax. We were very sad to leave and cannot rate this stay highly enough for beauty and relaxation and quality of our apartment. We have great beaches in Australia and thought this would be a one time trip to see Maui but on the strength of our visit we would be back in a heartbeat.

The reason we chose this facility was because of the excellent treatment we had received during our 10-day stay in March at an Aston condo in Honolulu. At check out at the Whaler we were presented with a bill of over $1,200. When we asked the receptionist by the name of Decs or Desc, what the bill was for, she said it was for the upgrade to premium. We then told her we paid for our upgrade well in advance before we even flew to Hawaii. She didn’t believe us and said all upgrades are paid at checkout. We could not believe our ears. She was rude and condescending and not willing to listen to our side of the story. Then we pulled the receipt of payment from our cellphone and then she went back to the office behind the desk. Eventually she came back with her tail between her legs and stated that we indeed made the payment and she blamed the whole thing on another manager who was not there. Nothing like “Sir we are sorry it was our fault”. Needless to say we will never stay at the Whaler again. My 23 days of business to this facility was not respected.

At the end of a big day of exploring, my partner asked if we could simply turn on the TV and see if we could find a show or movie to watch.    I tried (just before 10:00pm) to turn on the TV, which you would think would be simple. After turning it on I had to go through their full page of complex instructions for it to even scan through to check for any channels. This still didn't work, so I called reception, asking for assistance, at 10:15pm.    They said they can't help me as their tech team went home at 10:00pm. There is no message on the instructions indicating the operating hours for assistance. I asked if there was anyone else I could speak to who might be able to try to come and take a look, but this was too much trouble.    We will be leaving tomorrow so their offer of sending someone in the morning is of no use at all. I would've thought it would be easy to: A) Turn on a TV and use the channels that you've paid to have access to.    B) Get helpful service if you can't work out their convoluted instructions.

It's on a spectacular stretch of Kaanapali Beach and because most of the units are owned year round, it is rarely crowded. The pool is adequate, but you don't stay at the Whaler to be around the pool - you come for the amazing beach. I would guess that almost all rooms have a view of the ocean. The ocean front units are worth the expense if you can get one.  It's next door to Whaler's Village. Not far from the Sheraton/Black Rock/great snorkeling on one end and the Hyatt at the other. There is a path that runs along the whole length of the beach. There are plenty of restaurants sandwiched in between.  Each floor, if not each unit, has a washer and dryer. There is a small, but well appointed gym in the basement of each building. All the units have full kitchens and are well stocked with dishes, pots, pans and towels. It's nice to have the option to cook some meals, or even just have cereal without having to go out.  The units are spacious and comfortable. We own a one bedroom/2 bath time interval and this trip we also rented a two bedroom/2 bath ocean front.  Any type of beach activity is available nearby. The sand is smooth and soft.

240636062,40,Nice hotel but no amenities. Very laid back.,"I booked a week in November at The Whaler with my new wife for our honeymoon. The hotel is located on the popular Kaanapali Beach in the heart of Maui. Understand one thing, if amenities are important to you i.e. Room service, restaurants on site, etc forget this hotel. This hotel is more of a timeshare hotel with condos individually owned by timeshare holders. Each condo is completely different than others and you're gambling with getting an updated condo if you don't purchase the guarantee upgraded room price.    Also understand that if you're looking for a hotel with nightlife, younger crowds and fun then stay away from this place! The guests of this hotel when I was there was primarily older, much older couples and a few kids. I saw one other couple around our age (30). If you're looking for a relaxing time and no noise and you just want people to leave you alone this is the place for you. I personally preferred this as I was on my honeymoon and wasn't on a guys trip so wasn't looking for noise and partying. I needed relaxation.    Now for the actual hotel, it's ok. The grounds are beautiful, nice koi pond and perfect grass. All rooms have full views of the ocean and you are located steps away from the beach! You are also located next door to The Whaler Village which is a fantastic little shopping mall with restaurants etc. great place to go. Beach is open all the way to the black rock near Sheraton. Much nicer and younger crowds down there. Beaches are nice and water is nice but nothing like you see in Dominican i.e. Turquoise waters, calm waters. The pool sucks and needs updating but it suits it's purpose. Lawn chairs are old and need replacing.    The Whaler is also located a 5 minute drive from Lahaina. This little town is amazing! We went there every night. Shops everywhere, restaurants everywhere. I loved it. Please please please go here.    We stayed in room 613 in a studio room. The room is enormous for a studio! The room appears to have been recently updated and like I said the views and lanai were amazing! Bed and pillows horrible!! Bring your own pillows seriously! Bathtub was dingy didn't like that. I love that this room had a full kitchen, saved us a lot of money as we bought groceries at Costco and did most of the cooking ourselves. Cleaning was mediocre at best. Didn't wipe down any surfaces, seems they just vacuumed and did the bed and left the rest. Also be aware there is a $20 a day parking fee which they conveniently ""forgot"" to mention to us until we checked out and had to pay.    If you're looking for a laid back place, close to the beach and for a good price this is the place for you. If you're looking to party stay away. Actually if you're looking to party in Hawaii this is the wrong place for you. Hawaii is suited more for couples and older people with families in my opinion. There are really no places to dance late at night and it seems that everything closes early. Again I didn't mind this, we were in bed by 10pm anyway. Another little piece of advice, if you've never been it Hawaii before don't just sit by the pool or beach. Rent a car and explore the beautiful island. It's safe and breath taking.    Would I stay at The Whaler again......Yes.",Nov 2014,November 2014,Traveled as a couple,,

240473713,50,The Best Place We Stayed in Hawaii,"Our family of 5 stayed at the Aston July, 2014. We opted for one of the premium rooms and we are so glad we did. The condo was beautifully furnished, with amenities and bathrooms that were nicer than our home back in Charleston. It was so spacious and the deck outside allowed for eating and lounging while we overlooked the village shops and ocean. The pool was nice. The workout facility was a bit small and in the basement - but who wants to spend their Hawaii vacation lifting weights. We walked every morning and evening to eat at the village right next door. Plus we played golf right across the street. That was a bit pricey but the course was nice. Even nicer was the awesome course at Kapalua - that was the best course my boys and I had ever played at. The sunsets during our stay were unforgettable.",Nov 2014,July 2014,Traveled with family,Premium corner room was superb.,"Charleston, South Carolina"

Fine for us but if kids stayed would have wanted toys. Spent 8 days and didn't really need a car but it was nice to have one for exploring.",Nov 2014,September 2014,,,"anthem, az"

Not a massive pool like some of the other hotels in the area but we didn't need it.",Nov 2014,November 2014,Traveled as a couple,,
239021733,40,"Best location, with some drawbacks","First of all, almost any resort you pick on Kaanapali Beach is going to be decent. You're in Maui, after all - there are no Motel 6's on this stretch. If your room is a bust paradise is right outside waiting for you to explore it, so it's not the end of the world.    That said, you'll probably be happiest if you know what you're signing up for. The Whaler noticeably differs from other options on Kaanapali Beach in that it's organized as condos instead of hotel rooms. That means that not every room is standard; our room was nicely updated, while our friends' room right next door was sparse and badly in need of an upgrade. It's all luck of the draw and you can't reserve a particular room. (It's my understanding that you can request a certain room number if you know the one you want, but there are no guarantees.) That leaves some uncertainty to the entire thing and you kind of just have to hope that you get an updated, modern room versus one that is terribly decorated or has a cheap mattress. I would post pictures of our stay but it wouldn't do the readers any good, since every room can be drastically different.    In addition to the room variations, the grounds are that of a condo versus a resort. There is no amazing pool with a slide like the Westin, no poolside bar or waterfalls, no restaurants attached, no room service. Again, it's a condo, not a hotel! The plus side is that this stretch is pretty small and you can literally walk five minutes to any of the other hotels to enjoy poolside service, cabanas, and the like.    Pros:  -Location cannot be beat, as it's right next door to Whaler Village with lots of shopping, restaurants, breakfast options, coffee, etc. The beach in front of The Whaler is also uncrowded and doesn't have a ton of umbrellas set up or people snorkeling, whereas some of the bigger resorts have a moderately crowded beach during the day.  -It's smaller than most of the other resorts like The Westin or the Hyatt, so you don't have the constant foot traffic and it's very quiet / peaceful at night.  -Parking is manageable, whereas it's notorious for being a nightmare at some of the larger resorts on this stretch.  -The balconies are generous and almost all of the condos have a nice beach view.  -Housekeeping was very nice and did a thorough job, including doing our dishes and vacuuming every single day.  -Because the grounds are a bit lacking, the price point is better than some of the other resorts and you get a lot more for your dollar.    Cons:  -The front desk staff isn't friendly. At all. We only dealt with them during check-in and check-out, so this was only a minor irritation for us.  -The pool is something you'd find at a Holiday Inn, complete with a cheap fence around it blocking the view to the ocean and white plastic lawn chairs squeezed into the area like sardines. We never went to The Whaler's pool and routinely went down to The Westin to rent cabanas. (You can rent cabanas from them with a credit card, you don't have to stay at their hotel.)  -No room service. Not a huge drawback but there were a few nights where we were exhausted and really wished we could order in. On those nights we walked next door to the Whaler Village and grabbed quick meals.    Things you need to know:  -The age group at The Whaler is more 50+ versus, say, The Westin which is more 30+. That makes for a peaceful, quiet atmosphere with no loud drunken groups stumbling about, but if you want any liveliness you'll need to walk a few minutes down to the other resorts. Even though my husband and I are in the 30+ age group we preferred the peacefulness of The Whaler since we could easily walk down the boardwalk a bit to get some live music or a poolside bar.  -The 1 bedroom suites are very spacious with a huge balcony, and are almost 3x as big as the studios. Do yourself a favor and shell out the extra money!  -Don't kill yourself trying to pick the ""perfect"" resort on Kaanapali Beach. Truly all of them are beautiful and barring some absolutely horrifying experience, I can't imagine any of them ruining a Maui vacation.    Bottom line: decide what's most important to you and pick a resort based on that. If you want tranquility and don't mind walking a few minutes to use other pool facilities, The Whaler would be great. If you want the full resort feel complete with a swim-up pool bar and waterfalls outside your balcony, look elsewhere ... and understand you may be sacrificing a bit of that tranquility to get it.",Nov 2014,November 2014,Traveled as a couple,,United States
237843584,40,LOVE these condos!,"We have stayed at the Whaler twice now. First was in May 2013 and we loved it so much, we went back for our vacation this July (2014). The room they put us in the first night on this most recent stay was very nice...upgraded, granite, very pretty. BUT, it was on the 10th floor AND the bed's box springs squeaked so loudly that even the slightest repositioning at night would've woke us up. Getting the room changed turned into quite an ordeal. We would've dealt with the high floor (I hate heights) but couldn't deal with a squeaky bed. The other condos available didn't have anywhere near the view the first one had and that we paid extra for. Other reviews state to be careful of ""oceanview"" as the description. I agree. The rooms facing away from Whalers Village in the back have their view blocked by trees. Not good. After being temporarily put in a condo in the back that had the trash bins and loading dock right outside, we were moved the next evening to a room comparable to the first one we were in. Could've done without the hassle, but no one seemed to care about the view we paid for in the main office.  Overall, great location and clean rooms.

We were so pleased with our choice, and kind of proud of ourselves for finding the Whaler! We were so happy we DID NOT choose one of the big resorts nearby, which are crowded and loud and totally obnoxious (in our opinion). The Whaler is quiet and has just the right amenities for honeymooners-a generous beach area, patio with grills, a large pool, and is within walking distance of tons of great beachfront restaurants/shopping if you like that kind of thing...if you don't you are still set enough apart that you can avoid it. The rooms are modest, but if you plan to spend the trip on the beach or exploring the island, you won't spend much time there anyways. The beach is absolutely breathtaking, and the view from our room was perfect. The staff was friendly and left us alone. We enjoyed walking the boardwalk at night, and got to check out a lot of cool places without having to even get in the car (a major priority).Highly recommend for budget-conscious travelers--you are paying half the price of a room at the Hilton with double the value!!! Plus you can access the resorts at any time if you want. Another perk-while the resorts are packed with loud, screaming kids (we love kids but not on our honeymoon) the Whaler was more of an adult crowd.

The pool at the Whaler is pretty basic, but having said that we only swam at the beach so it didn't matter. Our apartment was in tower two facing Whaler Village. We had sun all day which we loved. There was a bit of noise late afternoon from the live bands at the Hula Grill, but we loved this. No noise later at night. Our apartment was huge - even had two bathrooms. It was a little bit old fashioned for my particular taste, I.e. 'A bit 'peach' but the furnishings were of a high standard and it had very lush carpet which was great.

Great snorkelling by black rock, and the boardwalk which is lit up at night is a great evening walk. The staff was really friendly, and helpful.

It does not have a lot of appliances/dishes, but we managed fine. It was great to have a washer and dryer. This side of the condo does face Whalers Village Shopping Center, so you do have some noises as others have noted, but we did not feel it adversely affected our stay, and we did like the close proximity to the stores. Its quite a distance from Costco, so pick up food/drinks before you arrive. It gets windy in this area, but the pool area is blocked by the wind even though it is right on the beach.

234176335,40,"Great Location, some questionable staff","Stayed end of Sept into early Oct. It was our first time to Maui. I would highly recommend this part of the island. Kaanapali Beach is beautiful. As others have mentioned, there is a walkway from the Sheraton down about a mile to the Hyatt(and possibly beyond. We only got as far as the Hyatt).  Where the Whaler is, is perfect. It has a nice beach and a short walk to Black Rock snorkeling. I noticed that at the Hyatt for example, there is basically no beach. Yes it's waterfront but the water comes up to the grass, poolside so there is no sand.  The point is be careful where you stay if you're a first timer.    The units here are individually owned. We rented ours thru VRBO. The two of us had a studio on the 3rd floor facing the courtyard. Given the amount of time we spent in the room, it was perfectly fine. Consider too some units will have been renovated, some not.  You have to decide if you'll rent via VRBO for example or thru the 'hotel'. We got a better rate from the owner but it comes with some caveats and that is where the questionable staff comes in.  For example- the wife needed some needle and thread to repair a bathing suit. She went to the front desk and since we were not 'their' guests, they would not give her the needle/thread. Really?  Also booking direct with the hotel gets you daily maid service I believe. Booking with the owner typically does not. Ours provided a mid week cleaning which was nice.  We heard while there that there is an ongoing feud of sorts with the new ownders (Aston) and the condo owners. Aston wants to own everything which could explain their non friendly attitude towards non Aston guests.    As far as towers-  Tower 1 faces the courtyard and towards Black Rock. Caution. There is construction going on. They are moving the tennis courts and expanding their parking lot so rooms facing Black Rock will have construction views and noise. I'm not sure of the completion date but you can check with the hotel. The courtyard view in this tower gets sun all day so consider that if you prefer shade.  Tower 2 faces the courtyard and Whaler's Village. I agree with others, there could be unwanted noise coming from the shops etc. The Courtyard view will be quiet.    Sunsets are great. We ate at the Village (Hula Grill and Lehaina's) three times. It's really nice having a short walk to dinner.    Overall a good location, good stay.

It is perfectly situated on the beach and next to the Whalers Village (shops and restaurants) as well as adjacent golf and other hotel resort facilities/restaurants. If you have never been to this area there is a beach walkway that connects all the beachfront properties and everything is well manicured and maintained. You can park the car and not need it for days. This area is the “total package”! Agree with most comments on the other reviews.    Just the two of us rented a 1 bedroom studio condo which was adequate for our needs. We did a combination of eating out and eating in. It was on the 8th floor south tower inner courtyard side with an ocean view. Suggest getting a higher floor and avoiding the south side of the south tower (tower 2) to avoid the humdrum of the Whaler Village area.    The beach was great with many snorkeling opportunities. The pool was small but adequate although kids looking for a lagoon pool might disagree. There was a kiosk concession to rent out snorkeling gear, beach chairs/loungers, and umbrellas. If you want to parasail or take a sunset cruise those concessions are right on the beach and the catamarans sail right up on the beach for passenger pickup.    Car parking was underneath the towers and convenient although it would be nice to have the regular hotel luggage carts rather than the available shopping carts for taking luggage to the room. Those shopping carts were handy for groceries which we got at the Safeway Store just a few minutes south in Lahaina (sign up for a Safeway card for price discounts). There was a post office just south of Kaanapali Beach on the road to Lahaina for mailing those island acquisitions! There are laundry facilities on each floor (if you don’t have them in your condo) but they are cramped into a closet like space.    We did a helicopter tour of West Maui and Molokai (had to see the giant sea cliffs on the north side) through Blue Hawaiian Helicopter and the drive back to the airport from the Whaler was only 45 min. Suggest a morning tour as clouds usually build up in the afternoon on the east side of Maui. If you are interested in a luau we recommend the “Legends of Kaanapali” luau right next door to the Aston Whaler at the Kaanapali Beach Hotel as it is limited to about 300 people (vs 600-700 folk mobs at the larger luaus) and the food/entertainment was of high quality. It was the best luau we have been to yet. Book it online to save 10%.    We would surely come back again.

232291250,50,Beautiful condo in great location,"This was our first visit to Hawaii (from London), and, although we are timeshare owners, the first time we had rented a condo. We like the idea of having more space and having the use of a kitchen.    We phoned the resort prior to booking to talk through our options. As I understand it, all of the condos are individually owned. Some are rented directly from the owners, others are managed and rented via Aston. We decided to rent through Aston - this was a bit of a risk as we had no way of knowing what the unit would look like - we chose to rent a 1 bed 2 bath Premium Ocean View. The Premium element ensured a more ""upscale"" facility.    The unit we had - Room 607 in Tower 1, was superb. We like our Marriott timeshare villas, but this was even better. The interior design was to a very high standard, with a Hawaiian feel, but in no way cliched. We were one unit back from Ocean front, with views across the gardens and ocean. The lanai ran the length of the lounge and bedroom, and was equipped with a table with 4 chairs, a higher table with 2 high chairs (offering a view above the railing of the lanai) plus a separate sun lounger. And even then, it didn't feel cramped!    Location is great. The resort and has direct access to a swimmable stretch of beach, with the Whaler Village next door for food and shopping options. We used the pool a few times, which was fine, and booked a couple of excursions through the concierge. We could watch the sunset from our lanai, or walk down to Black Rock to watch proceedings.    The resort and unit were practical as well. Plenty of extra sockets to charge all our gadgets, easy parking underground, and a daily housekeeping service. We had to call maintenance out once, and they responded very quickly.    Okay, it's not cheap, but it provides reasonable value compared to other resorts on Maui. We were delighted with our choice and would happily recommend this resort to others - especially Room 607.",Oct 2014,September 2014,Traveled as a couple,"We were in Tower 1, 6th floor, facing the pool and gardens.

Being next door to the Whaler shopping and restaurants is a big plus. The beach is adequate but the pool area is just so-so and there is minimal landscaping especially compared to other hotels at ka'anapali. The main problem is that they don't have enough parking.

The Whaler was next door to many shops, boutiques, restaurants and of course an ABC shop ;-)    The room was spacious, with a well equipped kitchen and had all the expected hotel toiletries including washing powder. The balcony view was not the best as we were overlooking the shops next door, but we did get a small glimpse of the beach from here.    The sunsets on Ka'anapali beach were always amazing and mother nature never failed with putting on a beautiful show at sunset. The pool area was clean and the towel service for the pool was organised and simple to use.    The service at the Whaler was exceptional and the staff were more than accommodating. I was injured on a day tour and the hotel staff were very helpful in advising us on local doctors, how to get there and lent me the hotel's crutches for the remainder of my stay.

218773879,40,Location.....Location. ...Location!,"My wife, son(15) and I just returned from a lengthy stay at the Aston at the Whaler. For those that do not wish to read the entire review, the Whaler is in a perfect location right in the hustle and bustle of Kaanapali Beach. With the full size kitchen, the ability to save money is available if desired. The room, landscaping, pool and beach were all very nice and well maintained. The staff were very cordial and accommodating. So overall, I would recommend this condominium as it caters to families, couples and even solo travelers!    Like my title states, location is by far it's biggest asset! Being located right next to Whaler's Village gives you walking access to shops, restaurants, groceries and even activities!    Our condo (616) was a studio apartment with a king size bed, sleep sofa and was equipped with a full size kitchen. Our lanai faced the garden so we had views of the ocean to our left and the golf course and mountains to our right. There were gorgeous views whichever way we looked! The room was decorated nicely though needed updating, but was always very clean. The maid service did an excellent job of keeping our room clean and organized. Cleanliness is huge with us! With the full kitchen we were able to save some money and make breakfast and lunch most days. Dinner was our night out and we splurged accordingly. Groceries can be purchased at Safeway in Lahaina, about a 10 minute drive from the Whaler. Make sure you get the Safeway Club card because it will save you big $$$!    The grounds, landscaping, beach, pool and ocean were all very nice. Not exceptional, but very nice. In the last few years our family vacationed at many All Inclusive Resorts. With that said, we were accustomed to having everything included, even beach chairs and loungers. That was not the case here at the Whaler because there was a daily fee to rent said items. That was an issue with us, and I feel is worth mentioning. This might not be an issue for you.    I am an avid fitness enthusiast and exercise even when on vacation. With that said the Whaler has a small gym in the basement of this condominium. It is VERY small so forget about doing any kind of heavy lifting here as the dumbbells only go up to 35 pounds, and weighted plates max out at 25 pounds. But there is enough equipment to do a maintenance workout, and keep your cardio up.    I did my usual research on TripAdvisor for activities/excursions, restaurants etc. so here are some of the things we participated in and/or visited:    Maui Nui Luau (Sheraton Kaanapali Beach) - We tried to go to the Old Lahaiana Luau, but that was booked for an entire month! Crazy! The Nui Luau was nothing spectacular. It was average at best, food and show included. This Luau was picked at the recommendation of the Whaler concierge and it's best asset was an open bar. =)    Ululani's Shaved Ice - Awesome as reviewed on TripAdvisor. The flavors are exceptional and are similar to Matsumoto ice on Oahu. We patronized Ululanis five times during our stay! :)    Skyline Eco Adventures - Very very fun, but YOU WILL GET DIRTY! Even with that said, don't miss this activity. The guides made this trip worthwhile so we highly recommend this company! (separate review pending)    Gazebo Restaurant Napili Shores - One of the best breakfast meals I ever had. If you have the time to wait (30-60 minutes average) make sure you visit! Beautiful views and great food to match! (separate review pending)    Star Noodle - Not too sure about this place. Food was very good, but IMO the price was a tad high for the portions received. This place has a very limited menu, but all food we ordered was cooked perfectly and tasty.    Haleakala National Park - Sunrise, sunrise, sunrise! A 2:30 AM start may not cater to everyone though. LOL!! The views at the summit were stunning at best. Is it worth it? That is up to you, but what made our trip was a stop on the way DOWN the mountain at a resort restaurant called Kula Lodge Restaurant. The food, view and service were all exceptional! Their coconut syrup was by far the best we tasted on Maui!    Kapalua Coastal Trail - This nature trail is only a short 10 minute drive from the Whaler to the Kapalua area. The trail approximately 1.5 miles in length (one way), can start/end at Kapalua Beach Park and is free! We had an overcast day, but it was still a fun walk with the some gorgeous views! I highly recommend this trail if you have an hour or two to spare.    Hana Lava Tube - This was a tough one for me. My son loved this, but I was not as excited. It is basically a cave with carvings from the lava flows. My son loves this kind of stuff so we are glad we went. The entry fee was around $12.00 person, and it takes no more than an hour to go through the entire cave. HINT....it is dark in there! LOL 8)~    Road to Hana - Let me say this. They can tell you how long the road is and that it has a lot of turns, but you will not know what you are getting yourself into UNTIL you drive the ENTIRE road to HANA and BACK! We made the mistake of stopping at to many places and it took us over 3 hours just to get around mile marker 45 on the OTHER side of Hana. We decided to turn back at that point as the day was getting long and tedious. The roads are narrow and at times have sharp 90 degree turns. Some portions of the roadway barely have enough room for one vehicle. You will see when you get there! LOL :)    From the Whaler it takes about an hour to get to the ""beginning"" of the road to Hana and you can add time from there. Our day started at about 9:00 AM and we returned to the Whaler around 8:30 PM. The waterfalls and black sand beach were the highlights of our trip and made it worthwhile and memorable!    I apologize for this long review, but since we stayed at the Whaler I wanted to mention all the activities that were available if you stayed here. I should mention that we rented a car for our entire stay and I recommend you do the same. Lahaina is a great area, but you will miss out if you do not explore other areas on the island.    If I had to come back to Maui would I stay at Aston at the Whaler again?? The answer is.......YES!    Aloha and Mahalo!!",Jul 2014,July 2014,Traveled with family,,"Harrisburg, PA."
218568344,50,Perfection!,This was our 5th trip to Maui and 2nd stay at The Whaler. This time we went for it and rented unit 1101 oceanside. It was beyond amazing!!! When we pulled in the driveway with all our bags and groceries someone came out and helped us with all our stuff. We were checked in quickly and went right to our room. We rented the condo through Maui Resort Realty and got great service from them.    The unit itself seemed to just float above the ocean. The view was beyond amazing. And the walls were lined with mirrors so no matter where you looked you had an ocean view. The unit itself is immaculate with a brand new kitchen and bathrooms. This was a unique vacation in that we spent more time than usual in the unit because it was so enjoyable to be there.

From our balcony we could see a view of the ocean one way and a view of the golf course/mountain the other way !! Cute little birds visited us every morning (after breakfast)  on our balcony !  I believe we were on the 3rd floor. Every condo is decorated individually and ours was very tastefully done and updated.  The grounds are beautiful and we enjoyed feeding the fish in the pond every morning .  The staff was wonderful !  They were so friendly and helpful.

216308372,50,Best Maui vacation yet!,"We just got home from a seven day stay at the Whaler. This was my seventh visit to Maui, and all of my previous stays have been at hotels, mostly at the Sheraton. Kaanapali Beach is my favorite place to be, and there is enough in this area that you can go straight to your hotel or condo and not drive again until you depart. This vacation was to celebrate my daughter's 18th birthday and graduation so we wanted a comfortable trip and decided on the two-bedroom, two bath condo at the Whaler, due to the ideal location. The unit was absolutely perfect. We had more room than we needed for a family of four. The condo was modern and beautifully appointed, had all of the amenities we could need, and we felt at home. The ocean-front unit is the way to go...the views were spectacular! The Whaler staff were friendly and helpful, from the front desk to the beach activities. The beach is directly in front of the buildings and it was so convenient to spend the entire day out there since we could run up to the room at any time. We rented cabanas on the beach from the activities booth, well worth the price to avoid sunburn. We were also just a short walk down the beach to excellent snorkeling at Black Rock in front of the Sheraton. Usually a condo stay means you are on your own for laundry and housekeeping, but at the Whaler we had the luxury of daily maid service with the condo conveniences. If you are beach lovers like we are, clean towels daily are appreciated! Every detail of our week-long stay was perfect. We are already looking forward to our next vacation there. But the next trip will definitely be longer than just a week. Mahalo to the Whaler staff!",Jul 2014,July 2014,Traveled with family,"If you can afford the extra cost, book an ocean-front unit.

215749215,50,What a Lifesaver! OUTSTANDING!,"We arrived 15 minutes after making a reservation, arriving from a time-share exchange that we left after 2 hours, forfeiting our week because of the dismal room we were put in there (see my review of Kahana Falls, titled ""Checked Out After 2 Hours""). Aston at the Whaler cost us money we didn't expect to pay on this trip, but was worth the cost to us. We were planning to be on Maui for 5 days between Oahu and Kaua'i. We visit often, and have stayed in many places from Kihei to Lahaina to Ka'anapali to Kahana. The Whaler is the BEST place we have stayed at on Maui, based on a combination of view, location on the beach and snorkeling, accessibility to shops and restaurants, location, the ability to fix some of our own means in the studio room, and quality of the hotel.    We've been to other places in Kaanapali, but next time, we won't even bother to look at others; we'll go straight to Aston at the Whaler. My other recommendation to new travelers would be right next door, the Ka'anapli Beach Hotel, where we've stayed before and loved it; it lives up to its billing as ""the most Hawaiian hotel,"" but our preference for Aston at the Whaler is weighted by the ability to prepare some of our own food in the well-appointed kitchen area of the studio instead of eating at restaurants all the time, which can get pricey here.",Jul 2014,July 2014,Traveled as a couple,"No matter where you are, it will be good","Livonia, Michigan"

215469772,40,Whaler was a gem and the right location.,"We stayed at the Whaler for our anniversary in February 2014. The view from the studio room was unbelievable. The room had a murphy bed that when you were laying in it and the sliding glass door was open and the curtains pulled away, you could see the beach and hear the crashing of the waves. It was just romantic. The weather allowed us to live with the slider open for the entire week. It was the perfect size because we spent most of the days traveling Maui and walking the beach.  The moment we arrived, the front staff was inviting and amazing. They were just great! We used the services of the concierge and she put together one of the best weeks of my life. She listened to our preferences and made the right suggestions. It was the perfect mix of activities and events. The beach staff was patient, informative and helpful.  I would wake in the morning and sit with a cup of coffee and watch the whales in the distance. Whale watching is addictive.  Unfortunately, the perfect trip of a lifetime came with one party crasher. The cleaning staff assigned to our room. We are late-night partiers and were in no rush to get up early because we were on VACATION! However, the drill sergeant cleaning lady didn’t quite get the hint each morning that the little sign on the door knob really meant we didn’t want to be disturbed. But she knocked and woke us without fail. She proved to be an absolute distraction to the trip. It escalated to the point that we missed a room clean, fresh towels and bed change. She had her schedule and didn’t care for the fact we paid quite a bit for the rented room and our comfort. I know that the owners of the studio condo will know that I will never rent their room again but will stay on a different floor. What a shame, it was almost a perfect trip. I would hope the management would use my name and cross reference that to my reservation in February and identify the horrible cleaning lady.  The Whaler was wonderful but sadly, this one employee had to tarnish the efforts of all of the other great staff!

I would definitely take a trip to Lahaina, in the late afternoon for a shop and dinner as there is lots of places to choose from.

We took advantage of the fully equipped kitchen and made our own breakfasts and lunches. We also used the grills located on the property to make supper one night. The beach is well maintained, and we enjoyed the tennis courts as well. The Whaler Village located next door was convenient. We made leis there one morning and then did a little souvenir shopping. We also ate a delicious meal at the Hula Grill. The only downside is the lack of evening entertainment. We noticed other hotels had evening shows by the pool or in their courtyards.

The beds were either rock hard or extremely lumpy and uncomfortable making sleep difficult. The curtain in the shower is not fixed to the walls as we found out when it fell on me when I was having a shower  The ONLY redeeming factor was the minute it took to get to the beach and restaurants next door.

We ate on the lanai every morning, walked the path that follows the beach a few times, dined next door at Leilani's 3x, Hula Grille 2x, yogurt at the froyo store, and at subway. Thank goodness the ABC store was next door too bc we went there almost every day for tonic and sodas! And the beach! It is literally right out the door! We people watched, played in the waves, and took a brief walk to Black Rock to snorkel where we saw sting rays, turtles, and all kinds of fish! If my kids had been with us, I would have stayed at a resort with a better pool with slides etc, but for couples and older kids, the Whaler is perfect especially for the price. One caveat is that we could hear the ac running from Whaler's Village next door. At first it bugged me, but then I liked it bc I couldn't hear the people on the lanai next door.

213375635,50,The Whaler is a Fantastic Choice,"I haven't been to the Whaler in 20 years, but finally spent 9 days there in June. It was everything I remembered. The atmosphere is really the best for families. I was there with my 7 year old daughter and my 69 year old mother. My daughter made friends with the other children at the pool which was really a treat. The Whaler seems to be a place where families gather. I noticed a lot of families with younger children and also some older guests. There was never any riff raff hanging about and the security for guests was very good (key card access only to all areas, etc.) It was safe, comfortable and beautiful. One of the things that we enjoyed most was the full kitchen with all the bake ware and utensils that we needed. It really adds up as a huge savings in the end. We ate out a few times because we wanted to visit a few restaurants in particular but mostly I cooked. I could either take us all out to eat for no less than $75 or I could buy a $7 frozen pizza at the market and bake it in the oven. When you add up the number of meals during your stay it really helps to be able to prepare your own meals when you want to.  The housekeeping was also very attentive. There were a few times that we had to rush out in the morning after breakfast and when we returned the dishes were in the dishwasher and it was running! I never expected housekeeping to handle my dishes. What a pleasant surprise.  The grounds are gorgeous, the staff was friendly and the room was amazing! I don't know if all or most of the units are decorated similarly but ours was truly magnificent. The bed was comfortable. The pull out bed in the sofa was really terrible for anyone more than about 80 pounds, LOL...but, my 55 pound daughter slept there like a angel. She didn't seem to notice. I read that another guest expressed some disappointment that there was no bar or restaurant at this facility and while this is true, it really is not necessary in my opinion. The Whaler is peaceful and quite without it and really, you are mere steps from the neighboring hotels that do offer these facilities.  I would recommend the Whaler again and again.

Big Fridge, utensils, Beautiful bed, living area. Really it is the only way to spend a period of more than 2 days. The location is right on the beach. the hotel sent us a bottle of Sparkling wine, choclates and pineapple as a welcome, and as we were honeymooners.    its just a pity that there was no small bar in the pool area or a restaurant on site. As a hotel it lacks that bit of atmosphere. There are other options just up or down the beach but sometimes you just want to pop in for a quick drink on your doorstep. It also feels a bit old, and there are a lot of older people there (timeshare condos i think is the reason).

212461325,40,Breathtaking Views,"This is one property where I loved spending time at the large balcony. The one bedroom , 2 baths unit was of good size for our family of 4. This idea of 2 baths was good and helped us get ready on time each day. The view on one side was of ocean and on the other side of hills and golf course. Stunning views which I miss now. The breeze on out balcony was refreshing and not something we are used to. It had an adequate kitchenette.  From the Airport we took airport shuttle which charged $16 per person and dropped us to the hotel. It took around 50 minutes. On the way back we had a morning flight so took a cab.  I was quite taken aback that the place did not have any restaurant or room service. But Whaler village is adjoining property so you are expected to use the restaurants there. I realised only upon reaching that the property was mainly being used as time share or something so most crowd here was using it as time share property. I missed not having any service at the swimming pool as one likes having a drink or cocktail there. The pool seemed fine and wasn't too large and good part is that it is right next to beach.  Most of our meals were at Whaler Village and they were not cheap by any standards. Will soon review some restaurants there. We were not driving so either would go somewhere we could walk or take the local bus. Lahaina Town we visited by travelling on buses.

We has a great view up the beach.  - Great location - right on the best bit of the beach (this is not a surf beach, but beautiful sand and clear warm water. There is a reef a few meters off shore. This is not tropical reef snorkelling with a mass of fish life - even if you walk up the beach to Black Rock - but enough to have some fun)  - Staff were friendly and helpful  - Very good value for money - particularly if you don't need all the bells and whistles of a major hotel chain.  - Right next door to Whaler village with some good food option and an ABC store for drinks and snacks    Bad  Nothing really - the pool is a bit small and basic bit with a great beach a step away not a big deal (though maybe if you have small children or are not comfortable in the sea)    Our only reservation was really this part of Maui itself - which is a whole series of hotels / apartments along a stretch of beach - its not high rise but there was nothing ""exotic"" about it either.

209356909,50,Absolutely amazing,"When we first arrived at the Aston, we were easily checked in by the front desk. Nathan in the lobby was so nice and friendly. He made conversation with me about where we were from, sports teams, etc. He then loaded our luggage for 5 people on a cart and brought it up for us while showing us where our room was. We were on the fourth floor with an ocean front view (room 452). It had a wrap-around balcony, amazing showers, and awesome kitchen appliances. The view was perfect. You could see black rock perfectly. Nathan stayed in our room for a little bit and told us all about the room, pool, towel cards, shopping areas, etc. The cleaning ladies came everyday and loaded us up with towels so we NEVER had to ask for any. They also brought coffee and made sure that the beds were made.  The beach was great, in addition to the pool. There are plenty of places to lay out and tan. There is a place by the pool to rent beach chairs, snorkel gear, and more for very reasonable prices. We loved the grills the Aston provided it's guests out around back in the grass. We grilled burgers one night for dinner. The Whaler's Village shopping complex is just down the sidewalk, and we went to it multiple times during the week. The Aston is also a short driving distance from Safeway, the grocery store.  The garden was very nice, including the fish pond. Around 8:00 AM you could go out to the pond and feed the fish. There are lizards running around everywhere and it really gave you a Hawaiian vibe. The concierge was extremely nice and helpful when it came to us scheduling a snorkeling trip. We chose to snorkel with Teralani and it was AMAZING. The boat picked us up right in front of The Whaler's Village on the beach at approximately 9:00 AM, so all we had to do was walk down. They provided breakfast and lunch, and we saw TONS of sea turtles.  The only downside of Aston At The Whaler is the expensive parking. The parking garage is under the resort and it was about $12.00 per day.

We had a fantastic suite on the 10th floor with an ocean view that absolutely blew us away. The upgrades are fantastic - the bathrooms and kitchens were top notch and deluxe 1br's very very spacious. We ate breakfast on the lanai every morning and watched the sunsets in the evening.    The pool is great, and the beach fantastic (the ocean is strong here so beware). We walked town and snorkeled by black rock and actually swam with turtles!    The staff was very helpfull and the check in process went smoothly. The only tip would be to skp the parking garage and just park in overflow parking - it was actually easier since the garage always seemed to be full and only a 3 minute walk up the drive.

I had read many reviews on Trip Advisor before booking our stay at this hotel but must say despite how lovely the room and overall it is very good, we were disappointed. Outside our balcony door was the refrigeration/airconditioning unit of the Whaler's Village Shopping Centre which runs 24/7 and the smoke flu of the Hula Grill. This made sitting on our balcony not an enjoyable experience. and took the shine off our stay.  Other than this issue the hotel has good amenities and is right on one of the most beautiful beaches you could ever see. Other hotels in Maui offer free parking but not the Aston at the Whaler so if you're having an extended stay this may be a consideration. Would I stay here again? Probably, but not in the same room.

It's gotten old and drab looking, and I even had to repair the toilet the first night we were there. Some sprucing up needs to be done.

Daily maid service was great although they never made it to our room until after 2pm each day. The gym is located in the basement, it is very small but adequate. The property is about the location...fantastic. I have three adult children and they loved being able to walk to great restaurants within 3 minutes. Hula grill is next door with very good food and bar service. Right next door is Leilani's and Maui fish and Pasta both excellent places for lunch, dinner or drinks. Surprisingly an outdoor mall is also right there, this is a happening location. It's only a 10 minute drive to lahaina which is where a lot of water activities depart from.

206681632,50,"Surpassed my expectations, will return again!","My husband and I just returned from our fabulous stay at The Whaler. Prior to our visit, I was a little concerned with some of the photos I have seen on their website. The rooms seemed outdated and needed work. So after we decided to reserve a room anyway, I emailed the hotel to request for a renovated room since we were there to celebrate our wedding anniversary. The hotel promptly replied to say that they cannot guarantee they will grant the request but they will try their best. Upon check in, we were told they made sure they gave us a very nice room. The studio we got was in tower 1 on the 7th floor - a very cozy, beautifully decorated renovated room and we felt right at home. We loved the walk in closet, spacious bathroom, modern kitchen and the large balcony.    Right after we picked up our rental car, we drove straight to Walmart for food, drinks and snacks. We cooked our own breakfast each morning. After that, we would visit the pool/beach and just go back to the room to make lunch around lunchtime. So convenient and this saved us lots of money!    Parking is $12.50/day. They have an underground garage you can use but it gets filled up quickly in the early evenings so you will need to park at the additional parking areas near the entrance of the hotel which is only a few minutes walk to the buildings. There's a laundry room on each floor. and if we would have known earlier, we would not have overpacked! Buy all of your sunscreen, soaps, shampoo at Walmart, Foodland, Safeway when you get here. The price is the same as the mainland.    We loved spending our days at the pool. There's also a hot tub right next to it. The beach is beautiful and you can just walk down to the other hotels. This property is only about a few minutes walk from Black Rock, great snorkeling area.    I must say that most of the occupants of this property are seniors. There were a few families and younger couples but this is definitely not a party hotel. We (in our 30's and 40's) didn't mind this so much as we came here to relax.

205598342,40,Booking through VRBO? Read!,"I have stayed in 5 different units in this hotel and have talked to numerous full and quarterly owners. The Whaler is my favorite place to stay in Maui and is in such a beautiful location but wow does this property have some quirks!! I have only rented through VRBO and never directly through Aston.  The Whaler is probably your best “bang for your buck” accommodations on the Ka’anapali strip. Where else can you find a $200/night room WITH cooking facilities and a spectacular ocean front location? This is why I, and my family and extended family return time and time again.  So, the Coles notes are: Some units are 100% owner operated. Some are 100% privately owned but entered into the Aston rental pool. Some are ¼ share owned and operated and rented by Aston. These scenarios can make a MASSIVE difference in you selection of room.  My wife and I have recently experienced two COMPLETELY different vacations renting from 3 COMPLETELY different private owners. A studio we rented for our first vacation #964 was 5 STAR all the way. Completely renovated and with a high end designer touch. Owner was super easy to deal with and had ZERO issues. NOTHING bad to say!! One the flip side, we rented #107 (shared with in-laws. 1 bed, 2 bath) & #662 (studio) for our second vacation a year later. #107 is a DUMP!!! I have stayed in an outdated unit in the Whaler (#470. 1 bed, 2 bath) and had zero issues with as it was clean and very functional. #107 was well past its due date and was super run down and extremely dirty and filthy. Even had feces on the toilet seat when we arrived! Emailed the owner regarding that issue and many other unacceptable items and she arrived promptly at our door (she owns another unit right above #207). She basically thought nothing of our issues. She did have someone come to clean the windows and mirrors. My father-in-law and I went to Safeway and bought cleaning supplies and top to bottom scrubbed the bathrooms. Nice way to spend your vacation eh? Especially paying $300/night!! I could go on and on about this unit but will just say stay clear. Lucky for my wife and I (unfortunate for my in-laws), we pre-booked another room #662 and had 4 nice nights there. I would recommend #662 to anyone as it was well priced, nice and clean and the owner was a piece of cake to deal with!  So here are my tips if you are going to rent from VRBO. If the owner only accepts cheques and not visa, RUN!! They are trying to skimp every last $$ and not pay the small % visa charges. Shows what type of owner they are. Ask if the room has the new sliding patio doors. The whole hotel had the Lanais rebuilt and the exterior renovated and the option to install new patio doors. If the unit has existing 1970s sliders, speaks volumes to the care the owner is willing to put into their unit. If the comments on VRBO are entered labeled “Guest comment entered by owner”, kinda doesn’t tell the whole truth! What’s stopping the owner from not entering any negative comments??? NOTHING!!  The Hotel’s mission statement is to “Bring back the Hotel to a World Class Resort”…….(not exact words but something very similar). They have made strides but I have no clue on how they will achieve this with the ownership structure. Reiterated by many, many owners in the hot tub, it’s just like any other strata. You will always have the eager owners and the ones that want zero change and no money spent.  After 5 different stays here, and numerous friends and family experiencing numerous other rooms, I know what are good picks and what to stay far away from! Good luck with your search!!",May 2014,September 2013,Traveled as a couple,,"Vancouver, Canada"
205568467,50,"Highly Recommend Aston ""The Whaler"" on Kaanapali Beach","We stayed at Aston ""The Whaler"" on Kaanapali Beach April 5-12, 2014. It is a wonderful place to stay. It's not a huge resort, just two Towers. We had booked a one bedroom, two bath oceanfront condo but when we got there we were upgraded to a two bedroom, two bath oceanfront condo. Everything was very high end. The rooms are huge. The master bath was to die for. The kitchen was great too. Both the one bedroom and two bedroom oceanfront condos have wrap around lanais. I spent a lot of time on the lanai - it was so nice. We stayed in Tower I and I loved it. Tower II backs up to Whaler's Village Shopping Center and some people don't like being on the side that faces the shopping center. The condo has underground parking, an oceanfront pool and hot tub, tennis courts, a fitness center, a sauna, and a Spa. They also have nice BBQ areas for both Towers. You have to use your room key card to get into the resort and all the buildings on the property. They have someone in a gate house that lets you in during the day. A policeman that was directing traffic close to ""The Whaler"" told us to push a button at the gate house to talk to the office to get them to let us in when we first arrived after hours. They didn't tell us about that and I talked to them the week before we left to let them know we were arriving late. That is the only negative thing I can say about our stay. Everyone at the front desk was wonderful and I loved the security. Renting though Aston, we had daily room service. The beach there is wonderful.

Check-in is 4:00 p.m.  Beach/pool towels are provided daily at no charge so you don't need to bring your own.  The location of this property is the best feature -- right on Kaanapali Beach between Whalers Village (restaurants/shopping) and Black Rock (snorkeling).  My husband and I were in Condo 402 that was ocean front. Condo was in great shape -- had a wrap around lanai - 2 bedrooms/2 bath unit. Housekeeping was provided daily. A/C worked very well. Condo was very spacious and comfortable.  Staff at the Whaler were all top notch with good aloha spirit.  Cost to park is $12.00 per day. Underground parking gets full at night, but they have an outside parking lot on the property as well.  Best part is that Black Rock is within easy walking distance to snorkel.  Business center is provided with free internet access to print boarding passes.  There is a washer and dryer on each floor. We did not miss not having a W/D in the Unit.  Pool was average - more for the older crowd vs. young children. My only suggestion would be that they provide more shade poolside by providing umbrellas. Pool was refreshing especially after a day at the beach.

The property consists of two 12-story condominium buildings with approximately 300 units total that were constructed in 1976 but most of the units have been extensively remodeled over the years and now have beautiful slab granite countertops in the kitchens and bathrooms and large furnished balconies, most with spectacular views of the ocean. . .we even saw whales breaching from the tiled balcony!    Facilities at The Whaler include tennis courts, gym, lovely pool, spa, concierge, business center, pay laundry on each floor, but no restaurant. There is a conveniently located ABC market in Whaler's village next door along with several restaurants, many great shops, free lei making classes, and hula shows. There is also a conveniently located water activities kiosk located next to the pool where you can rent beach lounges, boogie boards, snorkeling equipment, paddleboards, or make arrangements for various catamaran trips and dinner cruises. The Royal Kaanapali golf courses are located just across the street from The Whaler and there is a free shuttle that you can ride from the Whaler's Village next door to the condo complex into the town of Lahaina.    The hotel staff is wonderful and we received daily maid service.

We usually stay farther north at the Westin Ka'anapali Ocean Resort Villas, so I was really surprised that we liked The Whaler's location so much. Our top floor studio (#1262) faced the courtyard, with views from the ocean to Black Rock to the West Maui mountains. We had absolutely no noise or odor issues from Whaler's Village or anywhere else. Huge sliding glass doors opened to a lanai for fresh air and watching Ka'anapali Beach come to life every morning, and watching the sun set in the evening. We felt sort of guilty for spending so much of our vacation out on the lanai!    Other than a great location, I was surprised that the studio was so spacious. The stainless/granite new(ish) kitchen has a full-sized refrigerator, full-sized range (stove/oven), hood microwave, dishwasher and full service/place settings for 8! (I think the occupancy limit is 4 for a studio.) The bathroom was newly remodeled with nice granite, tile and glass - and had a huge drawer/cabinet full of towels and bathroom supplies. The living area had a dining table and 4 chairs, a twin(?) sofabed, occasional chair with ottoman, large sofa with murphy bed in the wall behind it, coffe table, and large storage unit with TV/AV equipment. The lanai had a table with two chairs and a chaise lounge. The decor was very nice, and everything was in excellent condition. I was a bit worried that when the murphy bed was down, we wouldn't be able to move around, but there was plenty of room, so we never put the bed away.    The one thing missing in the studio was a washer/dryer (larger units have them), but there is a commercial set of W/D's on every floor that was VERY convenient - just two doors down from our unit. Cost was $1.50 per load.    I can't say much about the amenities of the resort, because we didn't use them. We don't go to a beach resort to swim in a pool, or workout in a gym. Snorkeling around Black Rock was fantastic! We received a flyer on spa services, but not sure where the spa was? Also, there isn't a restaurant/bar on site, but Whaler's Village is right next door, so we weren't lacking in food choices.    All in all, we had a wonderful time at The Whaler.

202477139,40,Love the location!,"This was our 5th trip to Maui and our 4th stay at The Whaler. You just cannot beat the location and we like to do a lot of our own cooking with so much fresh fish and produce available on the island so having the condo with a fully equipped kitchen is a must. We had always stayed in a one bedroom unit before but this time decided to try a studio condo. It was fine except that the kitchen was quite a bit smaller than in the one bedroom unit so it was almost an impossibility for 2 of us to be in it at the same time and the lanai was about 1/2 the size of the one bedroom unit as well. We enjoy spending a lot of time out on the lanai as well as we saw more whales from there than we did on the actual whale watching trip that we took. On our last stay at The Whaler, I complained that the bed was the most uncomfortable one that I had ever had. This time we had one of the most comfortable beds we have had. This was extremely important as my husband suffers from back problems and we almost considered staying elsewhere this time because of the uncomfortable bed last time. We were in Tower 2 on the 8th floor this time and the view was spectacular! One other downside was that we were just above Whaler's Village and during the day there was a bit of noise that came from there with delivery trucks and the large air conditioning unit (although I found that more of a ""background noise"") I would definitely stay at The Whaler again!",Apr 2014,April 2014,Traveled as a couple,,"Maui, Hawaii"
202474263,50,Vacation on Kaanapali,We stayed at Aston at the whaler from January 26th - February 4th suite 418 in the North tower.We had garden and ocean view. The studio suite was updated and modern and nicely laid out which made it quite spacious. We could sit on the balcony and see the whales. Whalers village was a 2 minute walk and there were restaurants and shops right close to us. The pool was lovely and we could sit there and see the ocean from the pool. We would certainly stay at Aston at the Whaler again. We had absolutely no complaints.,Apr 2014,February 2014,Traveled as a couple,,"Brandon, Canada"
202451500,40,Can't beat this location!,"We stayed here 5 nights in April 2014 while getting married in Maui. Our studio premium room was perfect for two. Unit 362 in tower two had been updated and overlooks the garden with a great ocean view. The grounds are beautifully maintained and you are steps from the beach and pool. A bonus feature is the Whaler shopping mall adjacent to the hotel with 3 nice ocean view restaurants that we enjoyed. Ka'anapali beach is beautiful - soft sand and calm gorgeous blue water. Like only issue with this hotel is that we paid $12 a day for parking only to find they sell more spaces than they have. We returned from our wedding and found a sign that parking was full and you were to park down a hill in employee parking and HIKE back (in wedding clothes in the rain). No valet parking and no spot even though we were charged for it. No apology and no refund. Then on our last day upon returning from breakfast next door at 830am, we were locked out - were told that management turns off all room keys at 7am on your check out day even though check out is several hours later. So aside from an apparently idiot manager with poor judgement, it was a good stay. I'd say great stay but for the oversold parking.

201219767,50,Perfect Spot on Kaanapali Beach!,"We just returned from our 1st trip to Maui. In our opinion this was the best location on Kaanapali Beach which is where you want to be in Maui. Located directly beside the Whaler Village (nice shops, restaurants, small grocery store) and surrounded by the larger more expensive properties (Sheraton, Marriot, Hyatt). There were many options along the boardwalk connecting all the properties including restaurants and activity huts (snorkelling, whale watching, etc leaving right from the beach). We walked the boardwalk at least once a day which extends past the resorts and almost all the way to Front Street in Lahaina. We had a ""Premium Ocean View Studio"" room located on the 9th floor overlooking the garden and the beach/ocean. It was perfect for 2 of us and included a full kitchen where we ate meals when we didn't feel like going out (breakfast and a few lunches).

200264685,50,Wonderful stay in paradise,"We stayed at The Whaler from March 22-29. It was not our first visit to Maui--or to Kaanapali Beach--but we thought it would be nice to rent a condo in a location we loved. And it was. The Whaler is located next to the Whalers Village shopping/dining mecca, and it was an easy walk whenever we decided we needed something from the ABC convenience store or if we wanted to dine out instead of cooking in our unit or at one of the Whalers outdoor grills. An early morning walk was a great way to start the day, and we could easily snorkel from the beach just beyond the walkway (we walked down to Black Rock to really get up-close and personal with the fishes and sea turtles).    When we arrived at the condo we were told we'd been given and upgrade, and we were beyond thrilled to find a lovely studio condo with gorgeous finishes in Tower 1. Our condo overlooked the courtyard with its koi pond and lovely manicured lawn. We also had a perfect view of the ocean for watching whales.    Our condo featured granite counter tops, stainless steel appliances and a gorgeous tiled shower. I think my favorite feature was the walk-in closet. There was plenty of room for all of our clothing and beach gear to easily keep the condo tidy.    The Whaler condo was very quiet--we did not hear any noise from the units around us, and we did not notice if there was any noise from the pool area.    The housekeeping staff did a beautiful job and promptly responded to any request we had throughout the week.    We began talking about our return trip to Maui (and The Whaler) before we had even checked out.",Apr 2014,March 2014,Traveled as a couple,,"Kalamazoo, Michigan"
199925351,40,Great place for families!,"March 24th- March 31st  The Hotel/Condo:The grounds were imaculate, the front desk people and concierge were very helpful and made us feel at home. This place was situated in prime location, near everything you need to enjoy your trip. I found it extremely quiet, would recommend it for seniors, people with small children and people who enjoy the quietness and aren't there to party.Ireally Loved the pathway that took us to Whaler's Village and all the other hotels and Starbuck's. Such a great location.  Rooms: On the first night we were placed in room 370, which although it was big and had a great murphy bed for the kids, was very outdated. I had written them with requests and at that point none were met. However, the second night we were moved to the top floor 1274. This room was renovated, had a great wrap around balcony, we could see the ocean, golf course and Whaler's village, beautiful! The kitchen had all the amenities and everything worked perfectly. The pull out couch was a little uncomfortable as to be expected..the bed was also quite firm. We had a cot brought in and some sponges for the beds.  The Ocean: Beautiful sandy beaches, the water was fabulous. The waves were farely small on the first few days, but got pretty big on the last couple days. Actually had to get an ambulance to take someone who dislocated his shoulder on a big wave..  Shopping: We took the bus from Whaler's village, which came every hour on the hour and took it to the safeway about a 10 min. bus ride to Lahaina. We had a vehicle for a few days and just drove there for our bigger shops.  Excursions or things to do: We went to the Old Lahaina Lu'au, amazing would totally recommend this Lu'au. Very Authentic. We were on a waiting list and were called the next day to take someone's spot. My daughters did surfing lessons with Maui Surfer Girls, they loved it and the trainers were fabulous. We went up to the volcanoe, which was not a great idea as it rained and was foggy, so we didn't see too much. Check the weather up there before driving up the long and winding road...otherwise it's a waist of time.  Negatives: We needed the room for an extra 6 hours and were charged 200.00, initially were going to charge us $260.00. Everything in Maui is pricey..Besides that everything else was great!  All in all, fabulous trip, loved the restaurants and would definitely stay at this hotel again!",Apr 2014,March 2014,Traveled with family,Up high with a wrap around balcony.

199901958,50,Good Stay at the Whaler Condominiums,"Our family of four stayed at The Whaler for spring break in 2014. We had a one bedroom, two bath unit. There was a king size bed in the bedroom, and a pullout couch in the living area of the condo. There was a full kitchen in the condo, which was great for making occasional meals to help save money vs. going out to eat. We bought some groceries at the Safeway in Lahaina and having a full size refrigerator came in handy (note; bring our Safeway savers card on your trip to save some significant money there). The condo (474) was located on the 4th floor in Tower II (the south tower closer to Whalers Village) and looked out over the courtyard area between the two towers. Our unit was furthest away from the ocean, but the view from our lanai was still great, providing views of the ocean and the mountains.    On the plus side:  1. The buildings, while a little older, were recently renovated on the outside, and everything was in very good shape. Our unit itself was in good shape, the kitchen and bathrooms were recently renovated.  2. Having two bathrooms, which were identical, was great for a family of four. No fighting over one bathroom.  3. Very nice kitchen facility.  4. The king size bed in the bedroom was comfortable.  5. The air conditioning system worked well for sleeping at night.  6. There was not much noise coming from any of the other units, generally very quiet.  7. The pool, hot tub, and other outside areas were very nice.  8. The lanai was very large, and since we had an end unit, wrapped around the outside of the building. Very nice to sit out there and eat breakfast or just read a book.  9. Two televisions in the unit, although we didn't watch them much (hey, you're in Hawaii).  10. Two tennis courts, with complementary rackets and balls available at the front desk. Courts were in nice shape and had a fence between them to cut down on chasing balls all over.  11. Daily maid service. As a condo, you normally don't get this service, but since this rental was handled by Aston, this was provided and it was always nice to come back to a clean condo.  12. Service: Everyone we ran into from the Aston was nice and helpful. We had an issue with one of the TVs working, and someone came up in five minutes and fixed the problem quickly and with a great attitude.    On the downside:  1. The kids weren't thrilled to have to sleep on the sleeper sofa. One ended up sleeping on the couch (without the bed pulled out) and the other slept on the floor on some foam pads we ended up buying. They didn't complain too much (hey, you're in Hawaii).  2. The parking lot under the buildings filled up quickly at night. During the day you can find parking, but at night it would get full. There were a couple of other outdoor parking lots about a 3-5 minute walk away from the building, not a big deal.    The plusses definitely outweighed the minuses and we had so much more room to spread out and relax vs. a hotel. We booked the Whaler as part of an American Airlines package, and as such this seemed to save a significant amount of money vs. booking direct with Aston.",Apr 2014,March 2014,Traveled with family,,"Lisle, IL"

199774953,50,Best Location to Stay in Maui,"Just got back yesterday from my 23rd trip to Maui, and I fell very fortunate for that. Hawaii is a magical place, most of the hotels and resorts try to create their own magic that isn't Hawaiian, but their take on it. The Whaler is Hawaiian, I think it's 80% owned, and 20% rental hotel units. The best units are owned by either Interval owners or full ownership. Both rent out the units, and having stayed here multiple times Tower 2, facing the pool/gardens/coy ponds, and black rock is the best spot to be.    They put in new grills this year, the grills work a little better, but don't have a thermostat so you have to work a little harder to get your meat cooked just right.    This is one of the few locations in all of Maui where you can do and experience just about everything and you won't need a car! If you have done the road to Hana and Haleakalā, skip the car. Inexpensive bus to both the Cannery Mall (Safeway grocery store), and downtown Lahaina. You can walk to everything else you will need to do. Snorkeling at Black Rock is amazing, two years in a row of seeing lots of Sea Turtles, and I always see lots of great Hawaiian reef fish. Good shopping next door at the Whalers Village, plenty of restaurants up and down the beach, golf across the street, and easy to get to Lahaina by bus for all of the other things you may want to do. Sunsets are amazing from this location, and you can easily ride the bus to town center.    When I have stayed at other locations, they aren't relaxing, to many new people that have never been to Hawaii, to pretentious, to caught up in trying to show off, or be something they aren't. I'd visit LA or New York if that was what I wanted in a vacation. I want to relax, and the Whaler on Kaanapali Beach is the best place to do that. Family friendly, nice pool, and great beach location.    Only negative is that I contacted the unit owner I was in this year about renting the same unit for next year, and it's booked up already.    Best time to visit: Last two weeks of March (The rainy season has just ended, and the Whales are still around).",Apr 2014,March 2014,Traveled as a couple,"Tower II facing Black Rock, it's worth the extra $$$$ if you are going to be in your unit...","Saint Paul, Minnesota"

As a big fan of Hotel Impossible, I gave the room a typical ""Anthony"" once over! The top if the fridge, tv and art work were clean - no dust! The room was immaculate with high quality linens. Even the lanai was extremely clean.    The kitchenette contained everything that we needed - full size stove, fridge and dishwasher, plates, glass and plastic drinking glasses, etc. the dishwasher was run several times while the room was cleaned.    It was windy, but the pool was watched over and leaves were removed shortly after falling. We also saw the pool tested regularly.    The ocean was right past the pool, and the hotel location was adjacent to Whalers Village, which houses shops, a convenience store, excellent restaurants and fast food.

197998593,40,An easy stay at Kaanapali Beach; we will be back.,"My elderly mother and I spent a lovely relaxing week in unit 256 at The Whaler in early February. We rented through Donna Bender of MauiCalls (www.MauiCalls.com). She provided excellent service in finding us something appropriate, with fairly short notice. Donna also provides her clients with her ""Local Girls Guide to Maui/Oahu"" which is full of good ideas and money-saving tips for restaurants, shopping and touring. Unit 256 is in building one (I think), second floor, facing the gardens, and only one unit removed from the actual beach front, although it is advertised and priced less expensively as a ""beach view"" unit. We did not have the sweeping, commanding view of beach, ocean and island of Lanaii as do the higher floors, but we liked the intimacy of the garden and having the beach so close to us. And we could still see Lanaii and all the way down to Black Rock, so no complaints there. Also, we did not need to rely on elevators and could easily walk the single flight of stairs. There were lots of families with little children but we never were bothered by any noise and loved sitting on our large, airy lanai watching the whales. The pool is small but nice, and you cannot beat the ocean swimming at Kaanapali. The especially calm waters in the sheltered bay at Black Rock were just a short stroll away through the sand or along the beach path.    To my knowledge there are no particular activities for children other than the beach and the pool, but you can rent all the beach equipment from the pool shop. Best to rent by the week if you will be there that long.    The Whaler is a low key, friendly residential complex that is old but well kept. The gardens are very pretty. Our unit was a very spacious one-bedroom, with an excellent king size bed. I took the living room hideabed which was not very comfortable for sleeping. However, the LR and lanai furniture was very comfy for sitting. There are new flat screen TVs in the bedroom and LR area. The buildings are old and our unit was rather dated and a little frayed around the edges, generally in good repair. There were a few things that did not work, but they were quickly fixed after we reported them. The kitchen is well appointed and equipped and we prepared many of our own meals, although it was very easy to take a pleasant stroll to one of the nearby hotels or restaurants.    Our one complaint was the bathroom, which is dated, indeed. My mother is fit and agile for her age, however, we had great difficulty getting her out of the bathtub, which was very slippery and had wall handles too high for her to reach from a sitting position. We did get some rubber mats for the tub, but getting out was still a trial. Thereafter she took showers, but still had to be very careful getting out because the floor around the tub is slippery when wet.    I must say that the maids were very generous with providing extra towels and we appreciated that.    I recommend being on the courtyard/garden side of the building. I have stayed on the mountain side of building 2 and did not care for that. No sun, and the wind from the mountains can be chilly. I definitely would not want to be on the Whaler's Village side due to noise from vehicles and building fans. Our lanai did not get direct sun and that was a bit of a relief, because it was quite hot. There is lots of sun out there if you want it. We were still warm and were protected from the wind.    All in all a super holiday.

Your experience of this hotel will depend to some extent on which room and view you have. We stayed on the 12th floor in tower 2, with a full view of the inner courtyard garden (lovely) and an expansive partial view of the ocean, which was perfect for whale watching. The location of our room ensured we were shielded from the noise of the pool and beach restaurants, and we never had direct sun on our lanai (which we appreciated but extreme sun lovers might not.)

196042996,50,Just Perfect,"We stayed at The Aston Whaler on Kaanapali Beach for 6 nights February 15-21. This was our second stay at The Whaler and it did not disappoint. This time we had an ocean view studio (#1264) and it was beautiful.    Because it was “whale season” in Hawaii, there were lots of whales to be seen. We sat on our lanai each morning having breakfast and you could see the whales out in the channel between Maui and Molokai. Sometimes they’d just spout up, other times they’d be jumping right out of the water. What a wonderful sight to start each day.    The beach itself is just beautiful. While we visited other beaches while on Maui this time, I don’t think any of them really compared to Kaanapali. The surf is absolutely hypnotizing and the beach is pristine white sand. A couple of days we rented chairs for the beach and sat there very contented.    I should mention that we paid a $12 parking fee each day. But it was a nice, well lit underground lot, so worth the charge I think.    We also used the services of the Concierge in booking and whale watch/dinner cruise on the Teralani. That was definitely one of the highlights of our trip. We are so glad that she suggested it.    Our trip to Hawaii included three islands and therefore three hotels. This one was by far our favorite.

195239232,40,"Great Location with Relaxed, Casual Atmosphere","First things first, this was my third trip to Maui and I booked this resort not knowing anything about it, other than the reviews I read on TripAdvisor. That being said, I was completely satisfied and pleased with our overall stay and felt that our expectations were met on many levels.    This resort is in a spectacular, beachfront location on Kaanapali Beach. The location, hands down, cannot be beat. It's a convenient walk to Black Rock, along what I call ""Hotel Row"" with a meandering path along the ocean, perfect for exercising in the morning and for access to other areas and resorts. The Whaler offers reasonable rentals (snorkeling equipment, cabanas, umbrellas) and the beach directly in front of the resort is lovely, in fact, we saw many whales throughout the day, some very close, which was amazing. The resort is also conveniently located next to The Whaler's Village, which we enjoyed for easy walking access to stores, shopping, and local restaurants. The staff is very helpful and friendly, from bell service to front desk to housekeeping and the beach kiosk staff.    The resort grounds are beautiful, along with the pool and jacuzzi, which are both very nice and located beachfront for a great view. I very much enjoyed not having to get up at 6am to reserve a chair poolside or on the beach, as you have to do at other high end resorts on Maui. This was a welcome reprieve from the early morning pressure I felt at other 5-star resorts because I never had any difficulty finding a chair or getting a cabana in a premium location on the beach at any point during our entire stay. This enhanced our overall experience and created a relaxing, casual atmosphere, that was very much appreciated from our perspective.    Of note, there is definitely room for improvement for the spa and guest shower areas located in the basement one of the towers (not the one next to the Whaler's village). While the updated fitness center was nice, the hours and view (again, located in the basement next to the spa and guest showers) could be improved. I would also say that staying in the tower next to The Whaler's Village was not optimal as our condo was directly next to the village, which lends itself to more noise, either delivery or service, but we did have a partial ocean view and for us, this did not factor in negatively to our stay overall. Our condo was well appointed, had a full kitchen, an oversized lanai, and delivered on all of the amentities we expected.    Overall, we were very happy with our condo and our overall experience. This is a low key, relaxing, and casual condominium resort with a mix of people, which was perfect for what we were looking for. We very much enjoyed our stay here and recommend the resort based on all of the above, specifically, the great location, convenience, casual/low key atmosphere with all the comforts of home (kitchen, lanai).

People were friendly to deal with. The location is great, right on the water and on the walkway that connects you with the Whaler Village, restaurants and other condos and hotels. We had a one room studio with plenty of room for two. There was a washer/dryer right near us down the hall. The balcony is the best! The problem? Our unit had not been renovated. It was clean and neat, but old: ugly green shag carpet, old fake wood flooring, plain white walls, no frills bath, uncomfortable couch. It's really in in need of an update (415). That being said, we would definitely book there again.

With 6 adults & 1 child staying, the full kitchen helped keep our food bill down. Easy access to the bus route at Whaler Village and at $2 per person, reasonable too. We stayed in tower 1, first floor directly past the main courtyard with koi pond. The security of knowing you couldn't access the building without a room key was huge for us. The suite we rented was slightly dated but since we spent most of our time outside the room it wasn't a big deal that the room looked older. The master bedroom's bed was extremely comfortable and with a second bedroom and a pull-out couch, we had plenty of room for everyone to sleep. The close proximity to the beach was a plus as we didn't have to worry about carrying all of our beach toys with us. Two minute walk and we were in the waves! If you do stay here, we advise taking the bus to the first stop at Cannery Mall. Look for Lulu's restaurant, affordable prices and excellent service.

We like the whaler as it is on one of the best parts of kaanapali beach and the pool is right on the beach. The only negative was that our room was on the Whaler's village side of tower two. the Mechanical equipment noise from the commercial area reduced our enjoyment of the balcony.

We rented 3 rooms and each was a bit different. We went thru a travel agent who booked thru Aston. Our room was 915-one room with an updated stainless steel kitchen, remodeled bathroom and fairly outdated furniture. Bed was very comfortable! The view from here was amazing! The other 2 rooms were more like suites, bedroom/bathroom in one and living/kitchen area in the other. I believe they were both owned units. One fairly updated, the other decor from the 70's. I believe they were 359 and 459 in tower 2. The definitely had more room, nice patios that spanned both rooms but our view from tower 1 rm 915 was the best. They faced Whaler village and large bushes. The maid service did a nice job, the overall hotel is clean and grounds are immaculate. Front desk could use some customer service skills upon arrival and departure. Lisa the concierge was the BEST and helped us book some great excursions; Steve's whale watch, Sunshine helicopter tour, ATV ranch tour and gave us great tips on other things to see and do. She was sure to find us after to make sure everything was good.  You will pay for chairs to use at the beach (this was new to us and disappointing) and pay $12 per day for parking.

What you get from Aston is a total gamble on room quality and rude, lying, uncaring desk staff. If you want to gamble with your vacation- go to VEGAS.    We like the Whaler location. However, EVERY CONDO IS DIFFERENT because they have individual owners. So the only way to be sure you get a nice condo is to use VBRO or the like and look at pictures and read reviews for THAT condo.    We've stayed at the Whaler twice in the last year. Both times we rented through Aston. Both times we reserved a 1-Br oceanfront. The first time we stayed there they told us there were no 1-br available, so they upgraded us to a 2-br oceanfront at no cost It was one of the nicest condos we've ever stayed in. Awesome. We wanted to come back. (I find that this happens a lot in this industry- they ALWAYS give you a nicer room or upgrade the first visit, then never again).    The last stay we were told that Aston has only a total of TWO 1-br oceanfront units that they manage. They had one available- unit 951. It was a total disaster. 30 year old furniture, ancient kitchen, smelled bad, broken dresser, lumpy bed, and noisy due to the Whaler's Village ventilation. We rejected it and they stuck us with a 1-br ocean view that had a tiny ocean view due to overgrown trees. Next day I went back and complained. After much delay and resistance, they ""offered a deal"" on a 2-br at a higher price. It was no deal, and the person at the desk LIED TO MY FACE and told me that it was a $1000 a night condo (Their web pricing shows $600, and has been that price for a year!).

We stayed last December to get away from the cold weather at home, and have already booked again for next month! It is very reasonably priced. The reviews pretty much say it all: Lovely grounds to wander about and enjoy the solitude (they use battery operated weed wackers and other quiet equipment, which in itself is impressive), fantastic beach, great shopping and dining at next door Whalers Village, or at a number of other restaurants just a short walk down the beach. The beach has never been crowded for us, and only (rarely) are there a few beach umbrellas or whatever set up on the beach in front of the Whaler. The little rental shack (snorkel equipment, boogie boards, sunglasses, lotion, etc.) is handy and most importantly non-intrusive - easy to just walk past and ignore when you are not to be a customer at that particular time, or are just picking up/returning the complementary Whaler beach towels. Staff was friendly and helpful too - and not just with what they are selling/renting. The condos are large, with excellent kitchens to save some money (for the big nights out) and to save time relaxing with a meal on the lanai at your own leisurely pace, and dressed way down :). Several good supermarkets both in Lanai town and just a bit north, if you want to see some other scenery. We found we could easily and comfortably cook a decent meal in this kitchen, and there are propane grills and eating areas near the beach in front of each tower, which get a lot of use and is a nice way to argue with other guests as to which of you left the worst weather to come and stay at the Whaler. Front desk staff (Aston, a class act!) were friendly, helpful, and efficient. Daily room service was excellent, and it was nice to come back to a fresh condo every day. Self service laundry on each floor, so you can travel light. Room accommodations were excellent in our unit - it was a ""premium"", and had a fantastically comfortable bed, new and ""shiny"" kitchen and bathrooms, and great wired and wifi internet service - we were able to stay in touch a bit, and thus stay longer at the Whaler than if we had to dash home quickly to attend to things better left unattended for a while. Our unit had an excellent ocean/courtyard view and we could listen to the waves all night as we slept. I don't know the layout well enough to know which floors/units have which views, but read the room tips and ask when you book. I know I want courtyard, as close to the water as possible, mid height. We find the Whaler to be a great base of operations to wander the entire island during our stay, or when we just want to head into Lahaina town now and then for shopping, dining, and exploring.

I would highly recommend this apartment as it was very spacious, well laid out and had a modern kitchen with absolutely everything we needed. The staff we encountered at front desk, beach hut for towels and rental gear plus the tour desk were all fantastic. We would definitely come back here again.  The resort is on one of the best parts of the beach (compared to Westin/Marriott/Hyatt which are further south) and an easy walk to Black Rock for snorkelling and right next to the Whalers Village for shopping and restaurants.  We were in apartment 102 which we loved , the only drawbacks were that a/ the decor was very dated - shag pile carpet, mirrored walls and old fashioned furniture and b/ ground floor meant we could not leave any of the sliding doors open during the night for fresh air, however it did give us easy access in and out of the apartment for quick swims.    There are BBQ areas at the front of both towers which are well patronised.    We probably paid too much for this resort ($944 pn via an Australian wholesaler) as we met a numbers of owners during our stay who rent out via VRBO or similar and it appears we could have saved at least 1/3rd (if not more) of what we paid by booking this way.  You should be aware though that the plus of booking through the wholesaler or resort is that you get the service if anything goes wrong. Our wi-fi dropped out twice and they fixed immediately for us, we had maids cleaning our room (and kitchen) every day etc. This is a big plus for me when on holidays!  We heard a visitor complaining that he rented direct and his unit was unclean and he and his partner had to clean themselves. There are pros and cons for each booking option.

189541271,20,$470 a night - my expections.,"I guess I expect better service. Here is my story.    We checked in on a Sat., after completing a 7 day cruise around the Islands. Sunday morning we wanted to do the laundry so we went to the coin operated machine on our floor. The cost of $1.50 to wash and $1.50 to dry was OK, So we put our first load in the washer. The machines only accepts quarters. The sign indicated that change machines were located on the LL levels of Towers I & II. I went to the LL of my tower and the machine was out of change. I went to the other tower and the machine was not working.    At this point, I had a load of wet clothes and no quarters. So I went to the front desk. - NO Luck , No quarters available and no help from your staff. I was told by the front desk, that I could go somewhere and get change or wait till Monday when the machines would be serviced.    Considering they have 12 floors in each tower and about 21 unites per floor, I am surprised that the front desk would not keep an emergency bag of quarters to cover their guests if the change machines run out or break. That would be the best service possible.    Now, I paid $470 per night. There are a lot of resorts in the area charging about the same rates and providing about the same level of service and amenities. It is expected that all things will go right and the service level will be good. What makes one great and better than the others is in the small details.    The rooms was clean, the view was great. The bed was OK, it could have been better. The kitchen was properly equipped, etc, etc, Now what do you think we will remember the most from our stay.

I have stayed at the Whaler on 6 of those occasions. This is the only property I have stayed at more than once.    Sometimes I really enjoy the luxury, and the really upper class treatment that you get expect and do get at other properties on Maui. When I go to Maui, I really just want to relax. I want to be casual, wear my swimsuit around, with a T-shirt. I don't want to be worried about being dressed up to resort wear standards of a collared shirt, and shorts to feel appropriate for the surroundings. Hawaii is laid back, and at the Whaler, it is still very nice, but I get to really feel laid back, and enjoy Hawaii for what it is.    Each time I have been to the Whaler, I have stayed for 2 weeks. I love waking up in the morning with wonderful views of Black Rock, and the Ocean. The smell of the Plumeria flowers, the ocean breeze, and the gorgeous Maui weather.    Again with the location, it's in a spot that generally gets better weather than many other parts of the Island, it's in the best spot on Kaanapali Beach, you can easily walk to the Sheraton or the Hyatt and see more, next to the shopping at the Whaler's Village. Great Golf discount at the Kaanapali courses, and a short drive to the best boogie boarding on Maui at Fleming. The snorkeling at Black Rock is one of the top 3 or 4 spots on the Island and is free if you have your own gear, or did an expensive rental for your whole trip. You can easily pick up food at the grocery, cook in the Condo, or use some really nice Community BBQ grills.

187932276,40,Lovely spot,Stayed at the Whaler for a few nights on Maui and it was lovely. It is a great spot to relax and the little shopping complex was very handy. The rooms are spacious and very clean and the kitchen facilities were very good. A minor hiccup as we booked for 3 but our fisrt room only had one bed. After a little discussion we were then upgraded to a 2 bedroom suite and it was fantastic! It had all the bits and pieces you need. We really enjoyed staying here. Only problem is most of the activites are closer to the airport which is about 40 minutes drive away. But for general relaxing it is a lovely spot.

This condo had everything you could ask for...but if you needed something more, all you had to do was ask, i.e., coffee grinder! Desk staff leaves something to be desired, but we had only 6 interactions with them. When I needed change for a newspaper or had to ask a question, I ALWAYS had to ring the bell and wait. Staff was ALWAYS in the back and came out after about 20 or more seconds. If I was an owner of one of these units, I'd want this fixed. None of the desk staff was friendly nor did any of us see them smile. Why?

187324542,50,Just right,"My wife and I have been to Maui many times, We would normally stay in Kihei. But decided to try Kaanapali as we would drive to Lahaina almost every night for dinner. I am writing this on my last of ten nights here. Upon arrival, my wife and I decided that the unit we were assigned just wasn't quite right for us. It was actually quite nice, just not quite right. We spoke to the front desk and were allowed to preview several other units that were available for a upgrade fee. We were happy to pay the fee for the different unit we chose. However it was only available for 6 of the 10 nights of our stay. Fortunately they had an equally lovely unit available for immediate occupancy early in the morning of our 7th day. The transition to the different room was seamless in execution and we didn't miss a beat. We simply moved from the 6th floor to the 10th floor. Both 1 bedroom 2 bath units were beautiful. Did I mention that the staff were very friendly and accommodating of our situation when we found our first room....Not quite right. This in a great Condotel. A very residential feel. Not a hundred posers around the pool. Just nice people . I will stay here again as they made our 20th anniversary stay very enjoyable. With a smile and generous use of their time, the staff here made our stay ""Just right."" If I had one suggestion, it would be to accommodate people who smoke. I myself am not a smoker, but it was quite obvious that many people who do, were perplexed by the draconian smoking rules. A few designated smoking areas ( off the beach) would make many guests feel more welcome.",Dec 2013,December 2013,Traveled as a couple,,"Miranda, California"
186871487,40,Nice stay,"This hotel was a great choice. I went to Maui with my mother in November and we had some specific needs for our hotel choice ( lots of space/full kitchen/good location). The Whaler met all of them. This property has a very homey feel to it seeing as how it's also a condo and many call it home.    Its location is wonderful. Only about a half hour drive from the airport and right in the middle of ""resort row"" I like to call it. You are right beside Whalers village which is perfect for picking up little things you might need and some great food choices. There's excellent, higher end shopping and free shows at the mall pretty much every night. You're also right in the middle of a beach walk that'll take you all the way up Kaanapali beach.    The property itself is lovely, beautifully maintained and clean. The two towers are very well kept and quick elevators I might add.    We had room 419, a one bedroom suite with a FANTASTIC view of both the courtyard and the beach. It has a huge balcony with a lounger and multiple tables/chairs. The suite itself was very clean and well furnished. We loved having a full kitchen so we could prepare some of our own meals and save a little money.    Staff was very friendly although there was a concern. On two different occasions returning to the room and discovering my key didn't work, I headed for the front desk. Both employees (whom I had never interacted with before) just handed over a key without asking for ID or any information besides my room number. I work in a hotel and we have safety procedures around issuing new keys. I found it a little concerning that someone could potentially gain access to my room simply by asking for a key. It's a small thing but something that did bother me a little.    Lastly, it was great to have a little beach hut on the property where you can get beach umbrellas/loungers/chairs etc.. I was a little disappointed at how much it was just to rent a piece of equipment for a couple hours.    Overall though, great trip! Friendly staff, beautiful property and fantastic location!

Every morning at 8:30am, the kids got to participate in the Koi feeding right outside our unit. We were also right next door to Whalers Village shopping center, which was very convenient. We were also very walking distance to Black Rock, where I took the kids snorkeling every day. Our unit was perfect.

There are two towers and beach towel cards that you redeem for beach towels and when you are done with it you give it to front desk or the booth next to the swimming pool.

185560179,30,"Lovely service, overpriced accommodation","We stayed for 3 nights after reading positive Trip Advisor reviews. We were given a 1 bdrm condo on the 2nd floor in tower 1 (condo 219).  It was located right next to the lifts so we heard the lifts going up and down all day and most of the night. The condo was very overpriced for what it was given the condition. Stained carpets & curtains that really need replacing, terrible sofa bed, cuboard full of clutter, broken light fixtures and wardrobe doors, wiring hanging out of the airconditioning and hot water coming out of the cold tap in the bathroom.  The condo's are advertised as luxury condo's and the pictures on the website show a nicely furnished, updated condo. Our condo certainly was no where near this standard and I have added some photos to show this.  We were also charged $12 per day to park our hire car which was the only place we stayed that charged this.  Don't hire the snorkel equipment here as it is a rip off. (you are paying for the convienience) We hired 2 sets of snorkel equipment from The Snorkel Store at the Fairway shops a couple of minutes away. The equipment was much better quality with great service including advice and maps for the best snorkelling at half the price.  If you want to hire a paddle board, there is a place between the Sheraton and The Whaler which is $10 cheaper per hour than the Whaler charges.  On the positive side, the staff are lovely, the gardens are well manicured, the property is well located next to Whalers Village and we had a great view to the ocean from the lanai/balcony despite booking a garden view. We were also given a delicious pinapple and cakes on the second day which was a very nice gesture.  Kaanapali Beach is beautiful and we snorkelled by Black Rock each day seeing sea turles and many different fish.  If you have a car, it is definately worth a drive to Napilli Beach for lunch at the Seahouse Restaurant and Merrimans a bit further along near the Ritz Carlton is also amazing!  This place certainly has positives, but it is very overpriced for what it is and being a special trip for my 40th birthday I was quite dissapointed.  We stayed in superior condo's both in Oahu and Kauai that were on the beach with ocean views and half the price of the Whaler, so I think better value for money could be found elsewhere or pay a little extra and stay at the Ritz Carlton",Nov 2013,November 2013,Traveled as a couple,Ask to view your condo first to ensure you are happy with what you are paying for,Perth

183291769,40,Wonderful Vacation at the Whaler,"My husband and I were at the Whaler from October 9-19th. (We did not rent from an owner – we booked through our travel agent.) We had a wonderful time. Marissa checked us in to room 1160 in Tower 2 facing the ocean/courtyard. She was so nice and helpful. Fred took our luggage to our room and gave us the rundown of the room features, etc.; another really nice staff member. And Nathan too, who helped us when we were checking out. Everyone that works there is always ready and willing to help with anything you need. Especially Rachel at the pool/towel hut – such a friendly and helpful girl. The towel hut is where you can rent pool and beach tubes, chairs, umbrellas, stand up paddle and board, and you can buy sunscreens, beach toys, eyewear, etc.    Our room (1160) was a 1 bedroom, 2 bathroom condo. It was updated nicely and had a wonderful view of the courtyard, ocean, Molokai, and Black Rock (see pictures, which include scans of the hotel layout and room number locations). Our location in Tower 2 was ideal – on a higher floor and the lanai was never in direct sunlight, so we could sit out at any time and enjoy the view and cool breeze off the ocean. We stopped at Costco and Safeway when we arrived to pick up food and drinks. Get your liquor (if you need) at Costco (better selection and lower prices) and bring your Safeway card, or apply for one, to get the lower prices for groceries. The kitchen has everything you need for cooking, making coffee, blending drinks, etc. There is laundry on every floor for $1.50 and the room has the “he” detergent you need. Every day, we would head to the beach with our Bubba Kegs to keep our drinks cold, some snacks, kindles, and just relaxed at the beautiful blue ocean.    We brought our own snorkel gear (but you can also rent it at the towel hut). We snorkeled at black rock (which is a couple of minute walk from the hotel). The snorkeling right in front of the Whaler was just as good. We saw turtles, rays, octopi, so many different kinds of fish and beautiful colors of coral.    The location of the Whaler is fantastic. Whaler Village with shops and restaurants is right next door. The shuttle to Front Street also picks up there every hour on the hour and returns at the half hour from Front Street. We did rent a car though, so we never used the shuttle. The car rental place at airport was so busy – the line was out the door – be prepared for a long wait to get your car, but the chickens, roosters, and baby chicks are entertaining while you wait. Having someone wait for luggage and another get the car is not a bad idea. (If you rent a car and have a Costco membership, fill up at Costco near airport before you return the car. Costco gas is 30-50 cents per gallon cheaper than the other gas stations.)    All the restaurants we went to were very good. At Whaler’s Village: Hula Grill, Leilani’s on the Beach, and Maui Fish and Pasta; and on Front Street: Kimo’s, Longhi’s Italian Restaurant, and Ululani’s for shave ice. The Hula Pie at Leilani’s and Kimo’s was great – a must get for dessert. We also went to the dinner/magic show “Warren and Annabelle’s”, which was really a great show – definitely look up their website for info on tickets.    My husband golfed at Kaanapali (right near the Whaler), Kapalua Plantation and Bay courses, and Wailea Emerald and Gold courses. He loved playing them all and the views were beautiful.    The Whaler is really a wonderful resort. It is not a big resort with all the bells and whistles. It doesn’t have a huge pool nor restaurants or shops, but it is right next door to Whaler Village which has all the shops and restaurants/food court you need. Most of the guests at the time we were there were older and some couples with babies. You really cannot beat the location or that fact that it is a well-kept, clean, and friendly resort.    We definitely want to go back to The Whaler next year!!!",Nov 2013,October 2013,Traveled as a couple,,Denver
183015423,40,Beautiful View from Tower 2 facing North,"I did a lot of research, and I ended up renting from the owner of unit#264. It was a very easy, pleasant transaction. This particular unit is a studio located near the elevator (but you couldn't hear the elevator or people in the hall) with a very comfortable king bed, couch, dining table, and two chairs. Even though the couch was a hide-a-bed, it would be too crowded with more than 2 adults. We did not cook in the unit. It was a great value for the location - this particular unit has not been remodeled; but we stayed there for the beach, not the interior decorating (it was clean). This unit had a closet full of materials for patrons to use: beach towels, snorkeling equipment, books, beach chairs, beach umbrella, coolers, iron, bags for the beach, etc. The bathroom layout is kind of funky. This condo is literally 50 steps to the beach.    Tower2 is closest to Whaler's Village, but we were on the north side so we didn't suffer from any noise issues. Our view was of Black Rock, the beach, and water. It was gorgeous. Breakfast and lunch on the balcony every day! If the view of your condo faces north, your balcony will be in the shade every day all day. If you face south, you will have full sun most all day every day. My husband appreciated the shade while eating.    The grounds of this hotel are impeccable. You can feed the koi each morning at 8:30am (at least M-F). I did not visit the gym. There is a washer/dryer on each floor - $1.50/load - quarters only. Change for quarters can be made on the lowest level, along with soap purchases. The concierge was VERY helpful. Booked a Sunset cruise for us - and the price was the same as an online quote we received. The front desk was helpful and pleasant. Parking is underneath the property at $12/night plus tax. We thought this pricing was ridiculous - especially if you arrive late and have to park by the tennis courts outside. I did not use the tennis courts.    The pool was beautiful and very clean. I never used the hot tub. Each patron receives a towel card - we never used ours. Tip: beach towels already draped over the lounge chairs at the pool means they are reserved already by other patrons. Go early to reserve your chair. We didn't go early, but we had no problem finding chairs. I never did see a public restroom at the pool.    The beach was gorgeous; but it is steep right at the water line. We felt it was too steep for children younger than 7. We saw many families spending their days in the pool with their younger kids.    The location of this hotel can't be beat! You are adjacent to Whaler's Village - Hula Grill, Leilani's, YogurtLand, Subway, and Maui Fish & Pasta (serves breakfast, lunch and dinner and it was THE BEST value). Starbucks is located a few hotels south of this one on the boardwalk. The cheapy ABC Store for all your needs is in Whaler's Village also. There is a grocery store just 3 lights north of the Kaanapali resorts also.    There is a paved boardwalk that runs between the hotel property and the beach, it goes all the way to Black Rock and to the end of Kaanapali Beach. It is busiest in the morning with joggers/walkers and evenings with families walking to dinner.

Perhaps I should have just stayed there because the room I was given on the fourth floor (407) had a great view but the room was dated and had rust around bathroom fixtures and yellow stained bathroom floors and dirty carpet and ripped furniture. Did I mention the ants in the kitchen (when I called the office they sent a young gentleman with a towel to get the ants and promised to send out a professional the next day, that never showed up). We were afraid to put our groceries on the kitchen counter and kept them in the bags on glass table or refrigerated items. On the third day a roach crawled from underneath the bed.. The housekeeping staff was rude and attempted to rush us out of the room as their started at 8:30 am and advised me I could refuse service. The third day the maid got into an argument with my husband since we vacated room at 11:00am and when she came back to clean, skipped one of the bathrooms. When I called to complain to housekeeping manager, she acted as if I was lying and proceeded to come to the room with another gentleman and at the door appeared to believe we were making it up that our bathroom was dirty, even with a pile of towels on floor and trash can half full. The general manager waived our $12 per night parking fee and indicated this is all he can do. Well $36.00 does not cover them almost ruining our Maui stay.

178050857,50,"Paradise, Maui Style","Found our condo via VRBO. Fantastic condo with balcony overlooking the koi pond, swimming pool, the Kaanapali beach and could see Black Rock. Good location with a shopping center right next door along with several restaurants that had indoor and outdoor seating. There is a trolley that comes to the shopping center and will take you down to Lahaina's Front Street with more shopping and restaurants. We rented our snorkeling equipment for a week from Boss Frog's, which is down the street at the Lahaina Cannery Mall. When snorkeling at Black Rock and also at Napili Bay. At Black Rock, we saw colored fish, stingrays and the large sea turtles. Great spot and you can walk from the condo to Black Rock. As other people have posted, the best time to go to Haleakala volcano is probably the next day, after you arrive, since most people are still on their old time zone. It's not as painful to leave the condo at 3:00am. Take a blanket or a light jacket because it will be cold up there. If you take the road to Hana, make sure you leave no later than 7:00-7:30am. You will need to take a lunch with you. The condo let us use a cooler, so ask at the desk. Make sure you hike to the Waimoku Falls and to the 7 sacred pools. If you want to learn how to surf, sign up at the Royal Hawaiian Surf. They were great and also took their time with you. That was on my bucket list and I am past 55 years old. Great time.

We have now been in three different rooms and have been please with them all. Full kitchen, living room with King bed, free safe in room, free WiFi. Washer & Dryer on each floor. Plenty of parking. The day of checking in they arrive with fresh Pineapple, which is so so good! We have always purchased a garden view, but you can always get a great view of the ocean from your lanai. The grounds are beautiful, I am a photographer so I love it all the tropical plants etc. There is a very nice gym, a nice pool and the best part of the Ka’anapali beach is just steps from all rooms. All three of the rooms we have stayed in have been clean and upgraded with granite counters etc. I love when you pull out of the parking lot the attendant gives you a “Shaka Sign” AKA Hang Loose each time you leave. This is perfect for families needing a condo and the best location. At 8:30am each day they put out free fish food for the Koi fish, our daughter loved feeding them.

177849257,50,"Loved it, Loved it, Loved it","Stayed here 29 Aug - 3 Sep and loved every minute of it. The Aston is amazing. Fantastic location and facilities and right next door to Whaler village for all your culinary needs. We had a fantastic ocean view and the kitchen was a bonus. I regularly do hotel inspections for a living and I would have to say this hotel ticks all the boxes. Only gripe would be the bathroom is is very small and the vanity area is too large - but having a walk in wardrobe was great. Lahina is only 10 mins away by taxi or take the local bus which runs nearly every 1/2 hour for only $2!  Also would advise don't book any tours at hotel - the girl who we booked through ( on a Saturday) heard our Aussie accents and immediately didn't want to know and couldn't have been less helpful - we wanted to do a trip around the Island and she booked us on the 'Road to Hana"" which was terrible ( Grayline tours) - she also booked us lunch without asking us if we wanted it - didn't matter as it was served in a local health center car park, very little choice and by the time 1/2 the bus had been up most of the food on the tables had gone - no where else to buy food from - this was appalling and one of the worst tours I have ever undertaken and very over priced at $350+ for 2.

What brings us back is the location and memories from previous stays. Being located on Ka'anapali Beach we can walk up the beach to Black Rock for snorkeling or take a quick ride to Lahaina for a stroll on Front Street. Also, being located right next to the Whaler's Village, you have several bars and restaurants close by for cocktails or dinner while watching the beautiful Maui sunset.

176726190,40,Excellent place and great hotel! Best choice on Maui??,"Hello!    Me and my fiance just came back from a 14 night stay at the Whaler and it is possibly the best vacation experience we have had, and we have both traveled a lot.  I will break this review down into a few different sections to make the reading easier.    Hotel:  The hotel in itself is very clean, proper and it feels spacious. In my overall rating I give it a 4 star based on the fact that the rating is supposed to be of the ""property"" only and not the overall experience, and a hotel without room-service and apparent ""luxury"" is not a 5 star hotel, which it doesn't claim itself to be neither. The rooms (Studio with ocean view) are big and very well organized! It is so easy to cook and arrange your things and it is a place like the which I could imagine buying one day (I would probably want a room or two more but you get what I'm saying). The grounds are well taken care of and it is all so clean. The staff is genuinely friendly and welcoming in every way. Special mention to Rod at front desk and the concierge Lisa. Great people that we were happy to have met.  Oh, just make sure to ask for a room facing the courtyard since that has a much more idyllic view and less noise. The other side facing the village has some garbage cans and ""back alley parking"" spots in view. Tower 1 was great to live in since the gym was just down the elevator.  The hotel has great access as well to the underground parking which you reach, again, via the elevator from both towers.    Location:  Like everyone says, this is superbly located in every single way. We drove around the island for a couple of days but did not find any beach that was quite as great as this one. It is wonderful for everyone, especially this part of the beach. It is the place where the beach is the widest and with the softest sand without any rocks. Most of the time calm waves rolling in and sometimes a sea turtle passe by close to the shore. Not far from Black Rock snorkeling spot where you find even more turtles and fish. It is not on the most crowded part of the beach neither which makes it a comfortable and easy thing to take your favorite spot day after day.  It also has the Whaler Village as its neighbor where you can find anything and everything you need. It is open late but doesn't create a nuisance to your stay at the Whaler hotel.  Not far from Lahaina town which is very cosy and nice to visit, and not far from Dollar Car rental which I can recommend warmly. (Book it through ""autoeurope.com"" for a good deal ;))    Maui in general:  The Whaler is in a great area of Maui. Great calm beach and nice cities like Lahaina nearby.  If you go you should definitely rent a car and drive around a bit. We took one day south to Wailea and Makena and 2 days in the Hana direction. The dreaded highway to Hana really is an experience. Sweaty drive through a wonderfully beautiful rainforest with lots of stops that all are worth a visit if you have the time (bring good walking shoes that can get a little wet and swimsuits if you want to try the fresh pools by the many different waterfalls). The road in itself is a bit scary at first since it's so narrow and the oncoming cars pass you so closely that sometimes traffic stops and you crawl passed each other. But it is so nice and on the way back you have a nicer ride since you are a little more used to it and you have the lane farther away from the mountain walls. :)    There are also lots of great excursions to make in this area. Snorkeling tour around the island of Laina was awesome for us who loves to snorkel, and for beginners as well. There is Ziplining in the nearby mountains for people without fear of heights and many different Luau's (Hula hula shows).    Overall:  Maui is absolutely one of the most beautiful places we have ever seen. The rainforests are if possible even more amazing than the ones in Thailand. The beaches are, imo, even better than the ones in the Maldives, although they are more golden than white. And the snorkeling is among the best in the world.  As I have mentioned before. We like to travel a lot to see new places, but now we will possibly make this our go-to place for a while to come. It is amazing and we could not have chosen a better location or hotel on the Island, and when we return we have no intention in trying another hotel. (We looked carefully at the other hotels along this beach and the hotels are either less nice overall, or has a much less nice part of the beach. The southern part of this beach has more rocks and harder waves which makes many of them to go on a pilgrimage to ""our"" part of the beach. The Sheraton hotel at Black Rock looks okay I guess, although it is so crowded there that it would be less attracting for people who wants to relax. It is only a 3-5 minutes of walk from the Whaler anyway if you want to try the snorkeling there, which you should. :))    Weather:  We were there now the last week of August and first week of September and it was very hot, a lot of fun, a little wind some afternoons, rain only one day which lasted about 5 minutes, and everyday you found some clouds on the sky however they rarely covered the sun. However, when they did we were happy for the short relief from the warm sun. :)    Food:  I have one negative thing though about Hawaii (the us) when it comes to vacation. And that is the food. The American kitchen is based on a 2 basic things, which is simplicity and fat. And it is not in anyway good. No where did we get even a really tasty burger or anything else. The breakfasts covers about 2 days of your need of calories. I will quickly correct myself now, we did actually find a place with good food. It was in the Hula Grill's finer dining area right next to the hotel. We ordered one of the specials of the night, which was a steak with sweet potato, prepared in a more sophisticated manner than the average American food, and it was splendid. We did pay 36 (or 38) $ for the dish, excluding tips, but it was worth it.    I mean no offense with my ""attack"" on American food though. It is just not in my taste. And I am sure that there are many places where one can find good and well prepared food in the US, it's just we haven't found it yet.    The hotel itself doesn't have any restaurant at all, but there are plenty of places around to get it, or why not cook it yourself in your well equipped kitchen? :)    Final words:  Go to this hotel and you will have a marvelous time!  I love it and if I liked the American food I would have moved here for good. :P    I hope this review was helpful, and I will be happy to answer any questions or give tips and advices if someone wonders about something more that I may have forgotten.

Best cheap food court with Nikki's for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Menus larger than restaurants. Best vegi pizza ever, specially for dieters. No grease on pizza but lots of vegetables and crisp medium crust. Excellent homemade type food. Also subway and a Mexican type shops. ABC also there.    Condo also near the westin hotel and easy walk to Sheraton. Sheraton has best beach next to black rock. Also most crowded with kids.    The ocean views from whaler among best. Two buildings are farther enough away from each other to get great views especially inside courtyard. Even side over whaler seems to be sufficiently open especially in upper floors. Hotels have more space between them than in Waikiki.    Studio is large enough for two adults. A third adult would be a little tight. Kitchen is size of small one bedroom unit in Miami. Full stove, microwave, dishwasher. Full counter top facing kitchenette table.    Beds in studio are mostly Murphy bed king near full size balcony. At first checking was afraid of Murphy with mattress on a wooden breadboard. Low to grown and there was exposed wood edge on corners. Wanted a full bed, but realized day after we checked in that it took up less room and it was actually easier to get up from bed and utilized the bed much the same height of couch. Mattress really comfortable compared to box spring. And we are in our late 60's with arthritis. Also view from bed was spectacular of ocean. We stayed in room 1164 right in middle of building facing inside court in bldg two.    One problem is with door locks and cards. Seemed to be a problem with many of door locks.. They seemed to be corrosive from moisture and often licks needed to be replaced. Staff was excellent however and they had maintenance constantly changing the lock internal computer mechanism. Towel cards were given. No problem getting beach towels. Not many working beach chairs or umbrellas compared to other hotels and condos on beach. Not a beach to lay on beach. Too windy and current change for beach laying. However little secret we found that our condo had free wonderful lounge chairs in an inside courtyard with large trees around. Really needed that in summer unless you want to fry. Most family members were around pool. Small old fashioned pool, but beach water is cleaner than a bath. Pool water was cleaned every morning but with amount of kids in it, safer in ocean water. Some good snorkeling at black rock. More danger of being kicked by flippers there than shark attack. Of course there were two shark attacks at southern beach by tiger Sharks. One death. We went three weeks after a hurricane hit area. Still churned up and rip tides at beginning of stay.

172543730,50,Exceeded Expectations!,"The Whaler is a beautiful set of condominiums on the north end of Kaanapali Beach. We stayed for a week in a 1-bedroom 2 bathroom ocean view unit. Our stay exceeded our expectations by far. It is a wonderful place to relax. We reserved through the website and requested the highest floor possible and best view possible. We got both! On the top (12th) floor of Tower 2 facing south. Each tower (and side) has its ups and downs. We loved facing south on Tower 2 because it faced the Whaler's Village, which is only 2 floors. So we had a vast unimpeded view of Kaanapali beach and the island of Lanai from our large balcony. We did have to get used to the AC units and the smells coming off the restaurants, but that was easy because the view was great. Inside facing units will look onto the well tended grounds and gardens, but probably get some pool noise. North side of Tower 1 faces Black Rock and some additional hotels. Regardless, you'll love it.    Our unit was beautifully furnished with a great kitchen and open dining and living areas. A separate bedroom and bathroom were through the door. The Whaler also has a number of propane grills on the property and a nice pool. After a week in hectic Waikiki, this was the exact opposite speed. Relax and go at your own pace. We took the $2 bus to Lahaina to shop (go to Foodland or Safeway), stocked up, and never ate at a restaurant the entire week. We used the grills 5 nights and everyone cooking was laid back and friendly.    Staff were warm and helpful. Our housekeeping was excellent.

170640425,50,Best Hotel Option on Ka'anapali,"I stayed at Aston Whaler Ka'anapali for 8 nights in July 2013 and have pretty much only good things to say about it. The hotel is smack in the middle of resort row, starting with the Hyatt to the south, then Marriott, Westin, Aston, up to Sheraton at the Black Rocks. So you are getting the same beach, amenities, and nice beachwalk as everyone else. I just bet you're paying less than anyone else for them!    We were in a studio on the top floor (12th, amazing views) facing south from Tower 1, so facing the interior of the hotel into the courtyard. I would definitely recommend this, as it is probably quieter than facing out to other hotels to the north or Whaler's Village and all its A/C units and deliveries to the south. Since all studios are clustered in the center of the building and ours was called ""ocean view"" I don't know what the ""garden view"" I was originally booked into for a lower rate would have been. Note: this is not ocean FRONT which I don't think you can have with a studio anyways.    Major pros especially for the area:  -NO RESORT FEE  -$12/day self parking  -no hassle late 2 PM checkout  -wide beach (it gets pretty eroded the farther south you go)  -condo facilities including full kitchen, so no nickel and diming on hotel restaurant lunches and breakfasts  -next to Whaler's Village with shops and restaurants (including Leilani's for Hula Pie)  -pretty grounds with well-maintained lawn, walkways, and large koi pond  -gorgeous ocean and mountain views, both visible from your condo since the building is positioned perpendicular to the ocean.  -friendly, helpful staff from the people at reception to the very efficient and friendly housekeepers  -we were given a bottle of champagne for our honeymoon    Downsides:  -no wi-fi, only hard-wired internet (and one cable, sorry iPad!)  -gym is small, in the basement, and has old equipment, including one of two treadmills being out of order and a broken rowing machine  -decor can be a quick trip back to Grandma's house  -small pool and fewer lawn chairs than the ""grottos"" at nearby hotels    None of these were enough to knock off the 5-star rating, especially since the beachwalk and surrounding neighborhood provided enough running options to make the gym less of an issue. I recommend renting a car so you can head into Lahaina whenever you want, grocery shop to take advantage of the condo facilities, and drive around the island to the Waihee Trail, Kihei, Wailea, and Hana.    Overall, if I return to Maui (unless I go to Wailea to try something different), I will stay at the Whaler.",Aug 2013,July 2013,Traveled as a couple,"High floor (they go up to 12), face the courtyard - we were in studio #1215 and loved it!","Seattle, Washington"

Amenities are based on the condo you rent, but the property itself comes with the common area luxuries that also excel.    The beach was just 5 minutes from room to sand. A great transition.

The room was very clean and quiet with a very comfy king size bed. Although I was not planning on cooking much, the updated kitchen had all the amenities needed to cook a full Thanksgiving meal! We had a garden view from the lanai that wasn't too bad. We got a warm breeze and could see the blue sparkling ocean and hear the chirping birds daily.    The pool area was small and well maintained, but we spent most of our time on the beach, which was just steps away.  The staff was very friendly and helpful. There is a kiosk near the beach that rents out umbrellas and chairs, but the hotel has them for free. Snorkeling was fun right outside the hotel but a quick walk down to BlackRock was a better place to see lots of sea life including some huge sea turtles!The sunsets were Marvy!    Keep in mind that the property is smaller than some of the surrounding hotels, which gives it a residential quality. That was a plus for us!

The room was clean and well cared for, the concierge staff were wonderful and it could not have been a more perfect vacation. All of the hotel employees were warm, friendly and very helpful. We did the sunset ride at Ironwood Ranch, went ziplining and had an amazing meal at the Lahina Grill..",Jul 2013,July 2013,Traveled with family,Tower 2 is a bit noisy.

169308365,50,Excellent Condo + Amazing Location,"Our experience at 'The Whaler' was just too good! We booked an ocean view room and it was totally worth it. There was a lovely balcony with a nice view of the ocean (even though it's not ocean front and rather from the side of the building the view was still amazing). The condition of the property itself was really nice - the bed, kitchen equipments, bathroom, etc. On our usual holidays, we always eat out in restaurants but we liked the property so much that we ended up cooking at home a couple of times and staying in for b'fast/dinners on the balcony or even watching movies. They have free dvd rentals that came in handy.    The property is RIGHT on the Kaanapali beach so you don't have to do any walking to get there. The beach in front is clean and amazing. Also, it's right next to the Whaler Village which is a shopping/food area so that was very convenient as well. The Whaler Village is also a bus stop for a bus going into town (Lahaina) so that was really easy for us, since we didn't have a car rental as we don't drive.    All in all, excellent location and property. The staff were very nice and helpful as well.",Jul 2013,April 2013,Traveled as a couple,,"Singapore, Singapore"
169077950,50,Loved It - Family Vacation,"My wife, I and two children (tweens) stayed at The Whaler last week 7/13 – 7/20 in unit 607, Tower 1. We had an amazing ocean view as well as view of the mountains. The unit is a 1 Bedroom 2 Bath, full kitchen, was fully upgraded, new appliances, clean and accommodated us perfectly. The kids slept on a pull out sofa bed and my wife and I had the bedroom with the king size bed. We loved the easy access to the beach as the elevator system was fast and the short stroll to the beach (5 minutes from out the door to the sand). We enjoyed the underground parking convenience although at night it fills up quick in which case you’ll be parking by the tennis courts or entry. That only happened a couple times. The service at the The Whaler was excellent. House keeping was efficient, we had an issue with the Jacuzzi bath tube that maintenance quickly tended too, every person in the resort was sincere and professional. We very much liked the convenience of having the Whaler Village next store with its 3 restaurants (we liked Maui Fish & Pasta best), Maui Dive Shop, Parasailing, shopping and most important to me an ABC store minutes away. Although we did not use the BBQ, I liked the idea that they provided them. We passed on the swimming pool because the ocean water is far to beautiful but it did seem rather small. I like the fact they had an activity booth next to the pool which was very accommodating to us. Something my wife liked a lot was the beach in front of The Whaler was the least crowed of the entire stretch. I think its because its away from the public access points. Overall I am recommending The Whaler to everyone and will be staying here again.",Jul 2013,July 2013,Traveled with family,,"Westlake Village, California"
167861031,40,5 Days on Maui,"We started our Hawaiian vacation with 5 nights on Maui before heading to Kauai. We stayed at The Whaler from 7-3 to 7-8. I rented our room through VRBO and we stayed in 1056. We had an amazing ocean view and also a beautiful view of the mountains. We had 3 of us in a one-bedroom and had more than enough room. The unit comes with a full kitchen. The unit itself is kind of dated with very old cabinetry. The bed was very comfortable though. And the owner keeps two very nice roll-away beds in the closet which my daughter used instead of the sofa bed. Our friends came over for dinner one night and wished they had stayed there instead of the Sheraton. The resort itself is older and dated. The lobby looks straight out of the 1970s. The grounds were pretty with the koi pond. The pool looked okay, but we never used it preferring to swim at the beach. There was only one very small Jacuzzi that always had a bunch of kids so we didn't use that either. We did use the BBQ grills one night. The proximity to Whaler's Village was a plus as there are 3 restaurants and some nice shopping. I would stay here again since we prefer condos to hotels, just know that it's not really a ""resort.""",Jul 2013,July 2013,Traveled with family,,CA

167438306,40,Excellent! Room 951,"My wife and I were there for our first Maui vacation to renew our vows, and I wanted a truly amazing resort to cap off the experience. The Whaler proved to do just that. Room # 951 sits on the ninth floor and has two balconys with one facing south where you can see the wonderful shops which you can shop, with a few restaurants for a good meal without driving. And the other faces west with an awe inspiring views of Lania island and Moloka`i island. If you happen to be in the room at sunset, it`s also absolutely beautiful. There`s plenty of activities you can do from the beachfront below such as snorkeling on the catamarans which load/unload right there on the sand in front. There`s para-sailing too or you can just watch from your awesome balcony as you enjoy breakfast or lunch..as the room comes with all the comforts of home including stove, dishes, dishwasher(with soap) coffee maker(with cream & sugar) Frig. This room also comes with two separate bathrooms (which I liked) and the room sleeps 4.(two in the bed/two on pull out sofa)  The pool there is nice as well with a hot tub, and a nice tree there to chill out after a blistering day in the sun, if you`re lucky enough to get one of those chairs. The garden area between the two towers is truly beautiful with a small wooden bridge perfect for photos with huge Coy fish under you. My only gripe, was that the mattress was very firm, and just felt kind of cheap. For such an excellent room, they should put a nice pillowtop mattress in there. But even with that, if I stay there again... I`ll ask for room #951",Jul 2013,July 2013,Traveled as a couple,Corner suites are large and sunny along the beachfront.,"Texas City, Texas"

These units are the closest to the beach of any on Kaanapali and it's amazing to step out on the beautiful wrap-around lanai for the first time and look out at the ocean right in front of you. When we were in the unit, we spent most of our time here. The humpback whales were migrating and we used the binoculars we brought to look for whales. When any of us were out in the water or on the beach, they could be seen from the lanai. It was just a short walk to snorkel at black rock or to the catamaran whale watching cruises. The unit itself had a beautiful up-to-date kitchen with new cupboards, countertops and stainless appliances. The bathrooms were marble and a bit dated and the furniture and carpeting a bit worn, but this was fine with us because we didn't have to worry about tracking in sand or ruining anything.

Its not as flashy as the surrounding resorts but i thought The Whaler was good value and in a great location along Kaanapali.

We literally spent 5 days relaxing, spending happy hour at Hula Grill and then had dinner at the different restaurants each night.    The sunsets off this beach were some of the most amazing we had ever seen, and it was a very friendly place to be    Maui is generally expensive, in particular car hire - there are lots of additional taxes when picking up from the airport- so be aware! But the car hire was worth it to do the road to Hana. It was rainy and hard driving (50 miles and 600 curves) but the waterfall (just past Hana) was worth it. Incredible, lush greenery which is definitely worth the drive.    The good thing about the Whaler is that it is nestled between standard high class hotel chains, but not as expensive (we got a good deal through quidco/ hotels.com).

We stayed in a oceanview studio suite and spent a lot of time on the large patio. My only complaint is the bed is too soft and the shaggy carpet should be updated. Maid service was inconsistent and could use improvement. We left the service tag on our outside door and never got service on a particular day. Found out they stop working after 4pm.

Great restaurants, such as The Hula Grill & Barefoot Beach Café and Leilani's are right next door, in addition to Whaler Village. Whaler's Village is an outdoor mall that has great shopping. We watched hula shows for free there after dinner one night while eating Hagen Daz ice cream! We bought groceries at the Safeway in Lahaina and enjoyed breakfasts on our lanai.

This unit has improved each time we have been here since 2010, this time with all new bedroom furniture that was very comfortable.    What's unique about the north facing stack at the Whaler ( units ending on 02-24)? The floors above the 6th have an unobstructed view because the KBH hotel next door isn't very high. This means even the bedrooms have ocean views. There is also a front ocean view from the 02 stack. The top floor (1202 and any 12th floor unit on the property) has higher ceilings especially on the lanai's.    The north stack high floors, therefore, have the only unobstructed views both ocean side on the entire beach. All the other hotels and condos on Kaanapali Beach have views that include your neighbors, which decreases the privacy of the lanai. this link shows you where the rooms are http://www.vacation-maui.com/Whaler/Whaler_Sitemap.php    The service at the beach cabana is great, bellmen and front desk are friendly, and the grounds improve every time we are there.

The complex is next door to Whalers Village which has some nice shops and three wonderful restaurants.    The hotel pool kiosk and the equipment rental providers on Ka'anapali Beach all seem to open at 8am, so if you like to go out earlier it might be worth getting your towels the afternoon before.

160296150,40,Great family stay,"After reading some reviews and learning that the units are individually owned, I was nervous about what we would get when we arrived. I booked a package through Costco and went with a studio garden room to save money. I sent an email to the address I found on the Aston Whaler web siite. I requested a newly updated unit. Aston replied back and said they would forward their message to the Whaler resort. I never got a reply back so wasn't sure if my message was received. Anyway, when we arrived, I was a bit disappointed that we were assigned a ground floor room. We asked for an upper floor but was told studio gardens are only on the first floor. However, our room was pretty nice. It looks like it was recently updated. The bathroom/shower was beautifully tiled. We had marble countertops and stainless steel appliances in the kitchen. The decor was tastefully done...island theme but not over the top. Plus, we actually had a garden view! You never know what you'll get when you book a ""garden view"". As one reviewer commented, they ended up with a view of the parking lot. We were very fortunate. Either we got lucky or someone at the Whaler received my request and purposefully assigned us a newly updated room! Some people on here griped that they were disappointed because they were on their honeymoon, and I suspect expected something flashier. This resort is perfect for families and yes we did see a lot of ""older guests""...I suspect retirees. Nothing wrong with that. However, if you're on your honeymoon and want something fancy, perhaps stay at another resort. At times, we did worry my 6 year old was making too much noise in the pool, but no one seemed to mind and everyone seemed pretty friendly. There were other families there with smaller children.

We really didn't require any special service but found the staff to be courteous and helpful. When we book an ocean view or ocean front room we like to leave the patio door open at night to listen to the sound of the waves.

The room was quite dated, which was manageable, BUT for the price we paid, I think we could have done a lot better. The bed was probably the worst bed I've slept on in a hotel. Both my husband and I woke up sore everyday.Our kitchette wasn't really sufficent for cooking a good meal, so that was a bit of waste.Our ""garden view"" overlooked the parking lot. The pool area was not nearly as nice as all the other hotels, but it was okay. The place where you get the towels also sells maui jim sunglasses. It was incredibly annoying be hassled to buy things when all we wanted was to get clean towels. If you want to get a chair for the beach it's VERY pricey, whereas other hotels farther down had better set ups so that you could see the beach nicely from the pool. Finally while we were there the garden was being done and smelled HORRIBLE everyday making it gross to sit at the pool in the morning. I personally was disappointed. I usually don't have so many bad things to say...but you can't win them all.

159210765,40,Very Nice Place!,"All of the Whaler units I could see have wall to wall, floor to ceiling windows which is great for hearing the ocean. Before going I read we should stay in Tower 1 to avoid noise from the Whaler mall and to get 6th floor or higher. I called and found they could only note it on the reservation but not guarantee it. We arrived to find we were in Tower 2, 3rd floor. I asked if we could get a room in Tower 1 close to the ocean. Rod was very nice and found #607 (1bd/2ba) for 2 nights and then we'd move to another unit. The unit was updated & nicely furnished with a comfortable bed. At home we have ceiling fans in all our rooms and asked if we could find a unit with fans. This unit didn't have fans but Rod found a fan for us to use.    On move day we saw #356 (1bd/1ba) Tower 2 (inside courtyard/3rd floor). It was nicely updated with living room fan but no bedroom fan. Shower and toilet were in a small, separate room from vanity area. The unit had a stereo & nice sized TV, but the breeze wasn't as good as Tower 1. We decided to look at a Tower 1 unit (1bd/2ba, inside courtyard/10th floor). It was updated and very classy, had bedroom and living room fans, comfortable bed, and met our needs for the rest of the trip. We liked the room so much we don't want to share the unit #.

Good location right next door to the Whaler Village and restaurants. Beach right out front, snorkeling at Black Rock an easy 10 minute stroll up the beach and little huts dotted along the beachfront offering surfing/paddle board lessons and rentals. Loved strolling along the meandering paved beach walk which goes for miles along the front of all the hotels.  Not bothered by any noise from the nearby restaurants even though they were right next door......probably due to the fact that everyone is usually tucked up in bed by 10.00pm.  Friendly staff at reception.....especially Susan at the tour desk. Beautifully manicured gardens and lawns surround the giant fish pond.  We loved having breakfast every morning on the lanai looking out over the water occasionally entertained by the whales. A coffee maker, including coffee, is part of the kitchen amenities along with a beautiful fresh pineapple which had been placed in our fridge on arrival.....nice touch.  The only downside to this property is the size of the pool.....not a real problem as the beach is only steps away......and the fact that there is no restaurant and bar attached to the hotel.

We were quite pleased at the variety of restaurants nearby, and the close proximity of the quaint town of Lahaina. We even hiked from the Whaler to the far end of Front street for a great burger and root beer floats, but decided to learn the local bus system and hopped a quick ride back to ""home"".

I believe all units are privately owned and can be rented from various rental companies as well as from Aston, who operates the front desk. The two towers seem to date from the 70's, but are in good shape.    The adjacent Whaler Village has excellent dining and shopping choices. The beach in front of the Whaler is very nice and the private pool area, while not large, is very pleasant.    My one complaint is the shortage of parking. Every evening by 8:00 PM or so all parking places in the garage are occupied and the only remaining parking option is the employee parking lot at the far edge of the property.

Several had. We were able to walk through each and compare. All were nicely appointed, just a matter of location. We upgraded to a courtside oceanview on the 7th floor of Tower 2. What a pleasure to stay in. Views of Ka'anapali Beach and the mountainside. Huge bedrooms, fully supplied & updated kitchen, daily housekeeping, spacious wraparound lanai to watch sunrises & sunsets. The grounds are well kept. A landscaper was maintaining the large koi pond almost every morning we were there. Pool is small compared to nearby hotels but the beach is only steps away. We shopped for groceries at Safeway just down the road and ate at restaurants in the Whaler's Village next to the Aston. The Village gets loud & lively with music echoing through the evening. Tower 2 is far enough away we weren't bothered by it. During the day our condo area was quiet and low-key.

This is a two bedroom, two bathroom condo with a fully equipped open kitchen, dining-room and living-room. It is an oceanfront condo which wraps around with a mountain view also, and looks toward Black Rock. It has sliding doors to the wrap around lanai from all rooms; the dining-room, two from the living-room, and one from each bedroom. The lanai has two small tables, with 8 chairs, 2 stools, and two lounge chairs. There are also beach chairs and boogie boards on the deck for use by the occupants. The unit has a washer and dryer in the master bathroom, which has come in handy. We have enjoyed watching whales right from the lanai throughout every day. We also had a school of dolphins playing right in front where we were able to get pictures. Words just do not describe the true beauty of this place. This is our fourth trip to Maui, staying at the Westin, the Sheraton and Royal Laihaina the past three times, but any future trip we will definitely request this unit. To us it is much more beautiful than any we have stayed in, and all were ocean view or oceanfront. The Whaler has two buildings, I believe all units are individually owned and rented out; I found ours via VRBO. There is a pool and hot tub, as well as a concierge on site, an exercise room, and you are directly on Kaanapali Beach. We girls had massages at their spa, which is an Aveda spa. It is a small intimate spa on the bottom floor of building 2. The therapists we had were absolutely wonderful. It was recommended that we use the Hyatt's Spa, but decided to try the one here, and we're glad we did.

156428176,20,Partial Ocean View -- View of What???,"Recently stayed in a studio unit at The Whaler on Ka'anapali Beach. While paying for an *ocean view* unit, in reality the view was of a tiny -- and I mean TINY -- slip of ocean. Located on the north side of the north building, the unit's lanai opened to a small expanse of grass, while down toward the beach were located stainless steel barbecue grills. To see the ocean, I had to literally walk outside off the lanai and onto the grass and then turn to face the ocean. Definitely felt that what I paid was not as advertised. The unit itself was nicely furnished, with a comfortable bed and spacious bathroom. The kitchen was well-appointed.

The staff is wonderful and I feel they reflect the managers pride in the hotel/condo. From the bellman, pool people to the front desk they were all wonderful. All I asked for was a lanai to watch whales from and good weather and Hal gave us a great place to call home for our visit. Can't say enough about our visit here.

154418618,20,Great location pity about the service,"We booked a 1 bedroom apartment with a garden view at the Whaler and thought that that is what we would get. Instead we got a room on the ground floor facing the back and some trees. The room was very tired looking and needed refurbishment and because of the trees and the position it faced was in darkness all day long. One goes to Hawaii to get a bit of sun but this room didnt receive any sunlight all day long. We had to turn on the lights if we came in even in the middle of the day. I had booked this 3 months previously so it wasnt a last minute booking and having to take whatever room was still available.  When we complained to the desk the receptionist there was not very helpful and all she could say was that it was fully booked and that was that.  we were offered a room a couple of floors higher but were told that we would have to pay $150 a day extra, which we declined. we asked a number of times if we could change but were always given the same answer.  As for the other amenities, the position was great just next to the other hotels and cafes and next to the Whalers shopping plaza. However, the amenities could have been better, the pool was small and crowded especially compared to the other hotels nearby and nit very welcoming, and there was no cafe or bar there that could serve anything , we had to leave the premises to get something.

We love the location especially being so close to many great restaurants and a really nice beach and the beach walk. It is also one of the few hotels in this area that have condo units with full kitchens. The staff was friendly and very accommodating. We did find a couple of things that we didn't like and the major one was the bed. We had a one bedroom unit with a king size bed. After the first night we realized that we were not going to get much sleep on it as it was like sleeping on cement. We asked at the front desk if we could get a mattress topper to help soften it up and they had one on the bed within a couple of hours. This helped somewhat but the bed was still really hard. We have slept in a lot of hotel rooms and I have to say this was one of the worst beds I have had in a very long time! The other thing that was disappointing was how long it took to get any hot water in the bathroom sink. I don't like to waste water but sometimes it took several minutes of running the water before the water even turned warm. For the most part our stay was enjoyable and if there was improvement in the beds I would certainly not hesitate to stay here again.,Mar 2013,February 2013,Traveled as a couple,,"Maui, Hawaii"

Great location,condo living is great (can stay in and cook your own meal and sit out on the lanai under the stars and have a great diner. Nothing is better than that) We have been coming to Maui for over 20 years and you do get tired of all of the restaurant food. New grounds look nice, new facelift of the buildings look nice, pool is small but adequate. I would rather be in the ocean surfing anyway. Staff has always been friendly and helpful.

Wonderful ocean view from room and balcony unlike some properties who promise this but you need binoculars to see! Bex at check-in was extremely pleasant and efficient and everything went smoothly. My only complaint is the guests at all resorts, the Whaler's guests being no exception, who selfishly put out towels on limited chairs by the pool then leave them unused for hours.

Unfortunately, the units on that side are directly above the shopping center Whaler's Village, so it actually reminded us of staying in Waikiki...bright lights, noisy music, lots of people...not our idea of the experience we normally have on Maui. There are 2-3 beachside restaurants below you, which is nice and handy when you're hungry, but also contributes to the noise and crowds. Also, the wood fire oven at the Hula Grill ""treated"" us from morning to night to wood smoke...which included great food smells and also burnt food smells. The Whaler has 2 towers, and we'd recommend only the units on the north side of the north tower. On the south side of the south tower (where 1063 is located) you're overlooking the mall. On the insides of the 2 towers, you're looking directly across the garden into the units on the other tower.

I think what contributes to my mixed feelings is that I am expecting a hotel when it isn't, it is a condo. That is my own issue. It is obviously comfortable enough for us to return 2 additional times, so it is worth a visit. Your expectations just need to be set. Unlike a resort, there isn't a bar or restaurant, the pool is average, the service is minimal, the furnishings are slightly outdated. When thinking of it as a condo, which it is, these things shouldn't be expected. The rooms are large. They have a kitchen and big enough bathroom and closet. There are outdoor grills for everyone to use if you like to stay in. Since our last visit 5 years ago, they have done improvements to the rooms. The room had updated granite or marble in the kitchen and bathroom. Most of the people know each other because they are owners or timeshare members.

153306337,40,"Started on a Low, Ended on a High","We recently spent seven days in Maui staying at The Whaler on Kaanapali Beach. We originally booked a studio on line but up-graded to a one bedroom before arrival. Although Aston's web site made no mention of any difference in the quality and condition of available units, when we did arrive we were dismayed to find that our unit had not been updated in many years, was tired and worn, with chipped paint, old wallpaper, broken chairs, stained curtains, uncomfortable beds, only one lamp in the living room and old, outdated kitchen cabinets and appliances. We later learned that the condition and furniture of each unit is solely at the option of the unit owner and Aston has no power to require that the units be maintained properly. However, at a minimum Aston should refuse to rent this unit unless the owner updates and refreshes the unit to the standard represented on Ashton's web site.    We immediately requested a change of unit. Ashton staff was quite accomodating and moved us the next morning to another one bedroom unit which was spacious and modern, having been updated in recent years and maintained beautifully by its owners. After the move, the balance of our stay was excellent. The Whaler has a prized location on Kaanapali Beach, adjacent to the restaurants and shops at the Whaler Mall and near the restaurants and other facilities of a number of hotels and condominium complexes. THe Whaler's exterior and grounds are very well maintained, with an ample pool area, bbq facilities and many lounges for enjoying the Maui sun. Staff was always helpful and housekeeping staff did and excellent job cleaning daily.    One note of caution. The Whaler consists of two twelve story towers surrounding a central garden and pool area. Tower 2 is adjacent to the Whaler Villiage Mall. Our first unit was located in this tower, on the third floor on the mall side. At the lower levels your view of the beach is limited by tall hedges. More important, you can hear the restaurants in the mall (music and bars) and truck traffic into the mall (including trash collection trucks in the early morning), even with the lanai doors closed. If you must be on this side of Tower 2, at a minimum try to get a unit on a high floor.

Wonderful view from the large lanai which overlooked the beach including Black Rock (one of the best places to snorkel on Maui). Snorkel equip available for very reasonable prices at the Ka’anapali Village Shopping Center just next door. Trip up to Haleakala summit was worth the drive.

Wanted to go to the Garden of Eden about the 10 mi. marker but skipped it since it was raining. Unless you have small children, skip the ReefDancer in Lahaina - not worth the $$.

152831804,40,"Great beach, great rooms, but mediocre grounds and pool.","The Whaler is a laid-back, quiet, relaxed place to stay in comparison to the hustle and bustle you will find at the larger resorts nearby. However, it would have been nice to have more activities and amenities. The pool is very, very simple and small. Generally I wouldn't have a problem with this, but the fact that we were charged $12 just for a chair on the beach made it necessary to spend the majority of our time in the pool area - which wasn't much fun. If you are travelling with children, I'd recommend staying elsewhere because the atmosphere at the Whaler is similar to an old folk's home. On the upside, however, it was convenient to have a kitchen because the restaurants in Kaanapali are pricey, to say the least. It was nice to hop on a bus and get to a grocery store within 10 minutes. The best thing about The Whaler is its beach, which is by far the best spot along the entire stretch. If you stroll down either end of the oceanfront path you will notice the beach gets more and more narrow, and filled with rocks. So if you're looking for a beautiful beach, kitchen, and complete relaxation, The Whaler is the place for you.    Booking through VRBO or Whaler's Realty is the best bet so you know exactly which unit you will get and have photos of the actual interior.",Feb 2013,March 2012,Traveled with family,,"Vancouver, Canada"

It is the perfect location because of the ability to walk to Black Rock for snorkeling and the Whaler's Village for dining and shopping.  Even though the pool is not spectacular, it is warm and inviting. We stayed at one of the hotels with a fancier pool in Maui once, just because I wanted to try the pool. For us, it was not worth the extra money. The water in the pool was way too cold for my liking. The ocean seemed warmer. Plus we don't like having to eat out for every meal. The Whaler's condos give you an  ""at home"" feel, that a hotel can't.

151123907,50,Best location to stay on Maui,"We recently stayed at The Whaler on Kaanapali Beach. It was a week in paradise. The property is located right on the water on what I would consider to be one of the nicest beaches we saw in Maui. On two different days, we saw Alaskan Humpback whales frolicking in the bay right outside the hotel. The area has shops, restaurants, and a great ocean walkway that takes you from one end of the beach to the other. The snorkelling is fantastic, with Black Rock at one end of the beach being the top spot. All of the suites in The Whaler seem to have a pretty spectacular ocean view. We spent our mornings and evenings on our lanai relaxing and enjoying the sights and the sounds of the ocean. The staff at The Whaler is very friendly and helpful. During our stay we had something come up and required the assistance of the hotel manager. He dealt with the matter immediately. You can tell that customer service is very important to them. Our studio apartment was a good size for two people. It seemed to have been totally renovated as all the appliances were new, with granite countertops, king size bed, and a new bathroom.

We were in Unit 1202 again, which is the penthouse 2 bedroom that faces Lanai and the perfect sunsets, and additionally has a side lanai with unobstructed views to north Maui, Molokai, and the mountains. The kids room has 2 queen size, not full size beds, so is comfortable.Everyone is nice, especially TJ and Michelle at the beach hut. The pool can be crowded when the afternoon trade winds come in, but we stay mostly at the perfect beach. The rooms are nicely appointed, and the pillows are unusually comfortable and fluffy.

150792633,30,"Great location, poor pool","My Husband, myself and our 3 month old daughter stayed at The Whaler for 8 nights Jan 9-17th. This was our 3rd time to Maui and our first time staying at The Whaler.  THe location is great. We like being able to walk to different restaurants and shopping and so having it located right beside the Whaler's Villiage mall and restaurants was ideal, especially with an infant. It is right on the beach which is also great and super close to Black Rock for snorkelling.  Having a condo was also great when travelling with a child. It was equipped with a full fridge, stove, microwave, kettle etc and all the amenities needed for cooking. THey also provided 2 beach chairs, which was also convenient.  However...  THe service was less than steller. The front desk staff were not overly friendly. Our room service was lacking as well. One day we were out of our room by 9 am, we returned at 1 pm to feed the baby and our room was not yet cleaned. We left it at 2 pm and returned again at 4 pm to find it still wasn't cleaned. They finally knocked on the door at 4:30, which was way too late and so we declined room service that day. This happened on 2 occasions.  The pool area was also not great. It is a fairly small pool area and if you aren't there super early, your lucky to get a chair. THere is minimal shade and as such we couldn't use the pool at all because of needing to keep our baby out of the sun. It is fully fenced in, which in my opinion takes away from atmosphere. If you are sitting by the pool, you very well could be at a pool in any regular complex (such as my Grandma's townhomes here in Canada). Nothing about the pool area screams Hawaii.  I have stayed at the Marriott in both Wailea and Lahaina and their pool area's were amazing compared to this as was their customer service.    I am not one to typically leave negative reviews and am usually always happy with where I stay, but I think I was spoiled in the past with my experiences at the Marriott's and as a result was a bit dissapointed with The Whaler.",Jan 2013,January 2013,Traveled with family,,"Surrey, Canada"

Still the best I think are condos with the Black Rock view, higher than 6-th floor.  Location is outstanding, (two steps to snorkeling,gorgeous beach,restaurants,shops ),condos are spacious,the resort is quiet and stylish. I strongly recommend it for anybody and for any occasion.

150140161,50,Two Great Stays at the Whaler!,"My brother and I accompanied our parents to Maui to celebrate their 30th Wedding Anniversary last September and stayed 7 nights at the Whaler. We had discovered and stayed at the Whaler the previous year through a Costco promotion. We rented two studio condos in tower 2 and were impressed both times.    The Whaler is situated in the heart of Kaanapali Beach right next to the Whaler's Village. That means you are right next door to restaurants, right down the beach from snorkeling at Black Rock, and right next to a beautiful swimming beach. We had a freshly cut and chilled pineapple ready to eat when we checked in. The hotel has a free DVD Kiosk similar to redbox where you can check 2 movies out at a time per room during your stay. The pool and spa are located right along the beachfront path. The pool doesn't have bells and whistles like the neighboring hotel pools, but with a beach so close, the added amenities are not needed.    Our units were very nice and very clean. They had a equipped kitchen for cooking (we stocked up on fresh fish at Costco on our way from the airport) and a BBQ area close to the beachfront path. The views from the towers were incredible. Tower 2 looks out over Whaler's Village on one side and out over the ground of the hotel towards Black Rock on the other side.    The front desk staff was truly wonderful and made us feel welcome.    I would highly recommend this hotel.",Jan 2013,September 2012,Traveled with family,Rooms on the lower floors of tower,"Napa, CA"
148791721,50,The Whaler - great place to stay,"Our family stayed in Unit 121/123 at The Whaler during December 2012 and had a completely wonderful time. The unit is beautifully set up with two large bedrooms, both with king beds, a spacious living area and nicely equipped galley style kitchen. The master bedroom has an attached full bath and massive closet space. The main bath, located across the hall from the guest bedroom, is a great bonus. The living room/dining room has a great Hawaiian feel with the wicker style furniture.    The art work of Robert Lyn Nelson throughout the condo was incredible and much admired by all of us throughout our time there. During our stay, we came across Diamond Head Gallery which has Mr. Nelson’s artwork. We were fortunate enough to meet Mr. Nelson on the Friday, which is art night in Lahaina. This was an incredible experience for us and our daughters.    Having laundry in the suite is a major plus as we were able to do laundry almost every day without worrying about taking up the facilities that are shared by all the other guests.    While the condo is located at the back of the building, the ocean isn’t that far away and the privacy we had was excellent. The garden greenery blocked our lanai from the side, so we could have our curtains open without anyone glancing in as they walk by. Another great feature is that each room had patio doors, so in all, there were five patios that we could have open, enjoying the wonderful Hawaiian breeze. Because we were so close to the ocean, we didn’t spend that much time on the lanai. When we did though, it was so nice to have our privacy and so much room to relax in.    Prior to our visit, I was in contact with the owner. He was very helpful in giving us ideas of what to do/see during our visit. It was very nice to talk with him prior and I was able to contact him during our stay as well. Knowing that he was readily available was very important.    In our family, there are only four of us so the condo had more than enough space for all of us. The location is amazing: the beach is a moment’s walk away, Black Rock is a beach stroll away, next door to The Whaler’s Village, restaurants abounding, concrete walkway all along the beach, six minutes from Lahaina – what more can you ask for!!

148788397,40,Comforts of home on famous Kaanapali Beach,"This was my third stay at the Whaler over the course of 20 years. All my visits, including this recent one, were a lovely experience. Each condo is individually owned, so the furnishings are different in each one. This visit we had an ocean view 1 bedroom, 1 bath on the 7th floor of Tower 2. Tower 2 is the building right next door to Whaler's Village and the Hula Grill. fyi - Tower 1 is the building closest to Black Rock. We were greeted by a complimentary pineapple in our fridge along with 2 bottles of water and a note welcoming us. Our kitchen was modern (granite countertops, stainless steel applicances) and had all the dishes, cookware, utensils and appliances anyone could need. There's 3 grocery stores all within a 5 minute drive. Our lanai was large, and was shared both by our living room and the bedroom. The lanai had two loungers and a table with 4 chairs, and looked out over the bay across to lanai and Whaler's Shopping Village. Most mornings we had our breakfast at the table on the lanai, which was a wonderful way to start our day. Our bedroom had a king bed, sitting chair and ottoman, flat screen tv and writing desk with two large closets. The bathroom vanity was in the closet area, and the toilet and shower were separate - no tub though. The living room had a dining table with 4 chairs, a large sofa unit, a tv console unit with play station and dvd player. The unit was clean and easily became our home away from home for our 7 nights . The beach was wonderful and great for swimming (no rocks). The pool had enough chairs and cabanas for everyone. We did have a brief yet poor experience at one point with the woman who works in the pool area where you attain your pool towels, and she also sells tours, sunglasses and other items. She apparently was having a bad day and chose to be snippy with my husband and made a rude comment about mainlanders. You can also rent DVD's for free in an area adjacent to the office, and we did view 3 films - a nice option. Parking was in the garage for $13 daily. A couple of times the garage was full and we unfortunately had to park in the outdoor lot out beside the entry gate - a minor inconvenience.",Jan 2013,December 2012,Traveled as a couple,"All rooms are not alike.

The beach in front of the hotel is great, unlike the beach in front of some other parts of Kaanapali that is washed away. We love it here, having stayed at The Whaler at least 6 times. Get a room that has a water view, not all do. The downside to the Whaler is that the units are owned by individuals renting their place out, so you will not have qualty control between units.

147267798,20,"Unromantic, Badly Maintained, Not a Hotel","I was surprised and disappointed by my stay at The Whaler. While the condos do have beach access, each unit is a privately owned timeshare and ours was full of the owner's things with his name clearly marked in sharpee on everything. It left me with the bizarre impression of living in someone else's space, rather than the romantic getaway I was hoping for. Sure, you are right on the beach but there are plenty of other hotels along this strip of the beach which for the cost provide better amenities and a more relaxing, luxurious vibe. While I can see the DVD rental, wifi, and kitchen being great for a family or older couple, the place had a retirement home vibe that really ruined it for me and made me regret choosing it (the only aspect of my vacation that I regret, actually). The bed was a pull down murphy bed, which was not explained anywhere on the website or in the photos and which I felt was deceptive. Parking was $12 per day. The TV was positioned to the side of the bed, making it awkward to watch. There were sounds of construction intermittently which the hotel staff explained ""might happen"" if the other owners decided to on the fly make renovations to their units.The internet which I was using for work went down, and the hotel staff had a very ""hands off"" approach to dealing (or not dealing) with the problem, suggesting I go to an internet cafe or-ironically-the lobby of a nearby hotel. The swimming pool was small and the jacuzzi was without heat for the duration of my stay. There is shopping nearby but no room service or on site dining. There are so many gorgeous, similarly priced hotels in this area that the Whaler really needs to either lower its prices or up its presentation and service.

Kaanapali beach is our favourite place in west Maui and we think the whaler is the best location on Kaanapali.    Hotels to the south of the whaler have coral on the beach - not great for swimming. The beach in front of the whaler is sandy and perfect for playing in the surf. If it is crashing too hard for you, walk north up the beach 2 minutes and it is calm near black rock and the snorkelling is great. Saw sea turtles every day.    As joaocpaiva pointed out there are no restaurants or bars on the whaler property. Think of it as a private condo complex not a ""resort"". If you are into sitting by the pool and being served pay twice the money for the sheraton at black rock. We aren't into that kind of vacation. We never even went in the pool - the ocean is right there and the surfing in Lahaina is 10 minutes away.    Having said that, the Whaler village shops are right next door and have several great restaurants and good drink deals between 3 and 5. We ate there once. The rest of the time we cooked local fish on the BBQ's at the whaler, right on the beach. The pool looks great for the kids, has a hot tub area too. Just didn't bother using it.    We will definitely return and stay at the whaler.    A few tips on rooms:    These are privately owned condos. They vary widely in decor and state of repair. Book on vrbo.com directly from the owner and you know which unit you will be getting.    Tower 1 is on the north side of the property. Tower 2 is on the south side.

Our unit had an ocean view and a good sized lanai. We were very happy there for 4 nights.    We had a full kitchen, double stand up shower, beach chair and cooler to use. We were happy to have secure underground parking so we didn't have to put the top up on our jeep each night (never know when it's going to rain in HI).    The only drawback to our unit was that we faced the Whaler Village generator and A/C units. We closed the patio door at night as the mechanical noise was much louder than the ocean. It didn't bother us that much, but I would know better for next time.",Nov 2012,November 2012,Traveled as a couple,Don't go on the south side of the south tower if you want to hear the waves at night.

The grounds of this hotel are immaculately kept ,the Koi ponds are clean and the fish healthy, the pool was clean and well tended and then we stepped straight from our lawns to the beach front on Ka’anapali Beach…………OMG this was heavenly, and I hadn’t even seen the room yet.  The hotel view I saw on the internet, ended up being the same one I saw from my room when I was able to collect the keys after 2pm. I had balcony views of Black Rock and as it turned out, the Sunset over the beach each night! Again friends I was traveling with had opted for the five star down the road (in this case, other end of beach), and whilst they had a Macys and there were Penguins and Flamingoes in the gardens, who needed those to be impressed. I had a large One Bedroom unit, very well fitted out with separate kitchen, Dining area, bathroom and walk in robe, not to forget the large balcony. A nice welcome gift, - bottles of water and a wrapped, fresh, pre-sliced pineapple in the fridge. The condo Resort is right next door to the Whalers Village shopping precinct and the choice of restaurants and cafes were many to keep you from having to dine at the same venue each night. The beach was always free of traffic early but by 9am, started filling up, then come 4.30 pm, every one was leaving to get ready for going out for dinner early. My only regret, the stay wasn’t long enough.

This is a private condominium property but the owners do rent their units privately, throught VRBO and through Great Hawaiian vacations. There are likely other sources too. The buildings are 50 feet from the water, right on the beach, a nice pool and jacuzzi are also on the boardwalk. During the tsunami warning on October 27, 2012, the management had it all together. Everyone who wanted to move to a higher unit above the 8th floor was accomodated. The announcements were made via a PA system serving all units. The property is well-located, very clean, well landscaped and well cared for by the management and by the owners. We highly recommend that you look into renting here.

I wanted to make sure that I was close to the eateries , beach and shopping because I didn't want to rent a car. I had been to Maui a longtime ago and didn't want to see the sites. Just hanging out at the beach all day was what was planned. My sister wanted to see the sites so I told her to ask the hotel to arrange the tours for her. They were very helpful and she had a great time going on two tours. They set us up to go to Luau at Black Rock at the Shearton Hotel. That was one of the best Luau's I ever went too. Very good food and entertaining. The room was a two bedroom and two bath. It was very nice looking, but we did have noise two days due to some contruction work. But, they offered to move us, my family wanted to stay in that room because we were settled in already.

144503345,50,AWESOME!!!,"First of all, this trip to Maui, HI. was a surprise honeymoon I prepared for my fiance to give her on the wedding day. Our wedding was June 2, 2012 and I booked our stay here on since August 2011. Since the moment we pulled up, the bellboy was super friendly and welcomed us to The Whaler as he took our luggage. As soon as we walked into the lobby, the front desk attendant greeted us promptly with a smile on his face. He was friendly as he showed us a map of The Whaler and guided us around. We had an ocean view suite on the 10th floor that was amazingly huge. It had a full kitchen, dinning area, lanai (balcony/patio), huge bedroom, hallway to bathroom, 2 tvs (which we didn't even turn on ;-)), and more. It had beach chairs in the closet, boogie board, and golf clubs just in case we wanted to play golf at the beautiful golf course behind The Whaler. A fresh pineapple was waiting for us in the fridge also. The Whaler is right next to The Whaler's village which had shops, entertainment, and restaurants. Definately recommend The Whaler to all friends and family if they are planning to visit Maui. As mentioned above, we had the ocean view suite (Rm 1019) but The Whaler offers studios as well as ocean front suites with several bedrooms with garden views, golf course views, and ocean views. We definately recommend getting any ocean view room but preferrably a suite if you can fork up the extra cash, which is not that big of a differance in price from the studio room.",Nov 2012,July 2012,Traveled as a couple,"Room 1019 was awesome in size, view, and overall a great room.","Costa Mesa, California"

This year we decided we wanted at condo so we would have kitchen for breakfast so we chose the Whaler (rented through expedia because it was cheaper with flight). We had a studio room (316) and it had everything we needed. We weren't exactly ocean front but had a great view of the beach/ocean nonetheless. Kitchen had all the tools we needed, they refreshed our coffee supplies and towels daily. It could use new carpet, but was still in really nice condition. Large lanai, comfy bed, flatscreen TV (that we never turned on), and great staff. We usually buy beach chairs but for 12 bucks a day, we rented them instead. Beach towels were always available and we exchanged them frequently. Perfect place because we were close enough to the surfboard rentals/waves and also Black Rock for snorkeling. Whalers Village right next door - great happy hour at hula grill! Also, if you are flying out red eye, you can have them hold your luggage (or put it in the car) and they will give you guest passes to use the showers, etc. after you've checked out of your room. We checked out of our room at 9 am, spent the day on the beach, and then went back in to shower. Thanks Whaler!

143504209,50,Perfect Location,"My boyfriend and I planned a last minute trip and booked in with a package to the whaler for a studio ocean view room and flight included- what a steal! Our room was beautiful. Reading other reviews and seeing pics I asked the receptionist before we saw what the luck of the draw brought us if we could switch and he was very kind and said yes. But we didn't need to as ours was perfect and decorated tastefully. You can't beat the location!! Its right next door to whalers village and just a quick 2min walk to black rock. Also, we got an ""aloha book"" at check-in which we used all the time for dinners and goodies!! Saved us money and got us cute gifts. Even tho the pool is small it's really great and does the job. The people that work the rental booth are awesome! Super cool and helpful!! The grounds are quiet and perfect for relaxing which is what we wanted! We stopped in at Costco and bought things for our kitchen (ie food n snacks) which saved us money as well. Overall a super great deal and perfect for us.

143285782,40,Everything you need in 1063!,"My husband and I rented this studio condo in March directly from Bill and it was great. We have been to The Whaler before and we knew the area which is why we chose it again. The condo has everything needed and the kitchen is great with supplies in the drawers and cupboards which is also a great help. The only thing lacking is a dresser with drawers beside the bed for our clothes as having them in the storage room in the bathroom is not as convenient.    The view from the lanai is perfect for breakfast, relaxing, whale watching, or taking in the sunset.    There is a lounge in the lower level of T-2 which has a book exchange library for trading. It was great to have that option. There are a few books in the condo as well which was also a handy feature. There are also washrooms on that level to save you going back to your units.    The construction is finished however there are a few condo units being completely renovated which does cause some noise outside but only during day and not that bad. The grounds are being kept up everyday and they look good. There are a few open houses during the weekend which are great to look around in.    I did use the hair salon and it was great and my husband used the gym daily. We did use the pool occasionally however we prefer the ocean for the refreshing dip. We did not use the hottub as to my disappointment babies and children are going in despite the posted signs.    We have been to Maui many times and therefore did not use the concierge service for any activities. We do rent a car and travel around many parts of the Island on our own. Maui is perfect for that kind of thing as it has lots to offer.    The Whaler is beside Whalers Village and it has everything you need for shopping and dining options. The boardwalk is right outside the door for walking/jogging in either direction.    It was a great stay for the 7 nights we were there and we would certainly come back again.

Our choice of restaurants was excellent--several good ones at Whaler's Village, as well as others in area hotels. The staff were helpful and friendly, and our housekeeper was a gem. We requested housekeeping at a certain time each day (while we were out walking), and our friendly, efficient little woman was there each day, as requested. We purchased fresh fruit at Foodland (the Hawaiian market in Lahaina) the enjoyed breakfast each morning on the lanai--perfect.

143057719,50,Incredible Staff!,"My review is based on a very atypical situation, but I think it says a lot about the hotel's staff. I sent my elderly father to stay at the hotel for a few weeks on his own. He is accustomed to traveling on his own but clearly those days are now past him and it was my mistake to let him go alone. On the third day into his vacation he had a medical incident and had to go to the local hospital. I contacted the hotel manager, Hal, and he quickly sprang into action. He alerted his whole staff of the situation, helped me think through the safest way to get my father home, found a nearby nursing assistance team to take him to the airport, and just generally helped us through the ordeal every step of the way. He even sent a follow-up e-mail to make sure my father had made it safely through the plane ride home and to express his good wishes for his health.    There was a lot of coordination and back and forth during this situation because my father was disoriented from the medical event and difficult to work with and the patience and empathy of Hal and his staff throughout was exceptional to say the least. I don't think they want to be the go-to hotel for people that might need such medical assistance. Indeed, they are not designed for such. My point is simply that they went over and beyond the call of duty and I think that says a lot about the people that work there. I hope you never need such services, but I think it is good to know that you are staying at a place where people have such values. Again, a big thank you to Hal and the staff at the Whaler.

We have found each of the condos through vrbo.com and this has saved quite a lot of money compared to making a reservation through the Aston website. The Whaler is an older property that has undergone extensive exterior improvements over the last 4 years. Each condo unit is individually owned so some are updated and some are not. One of the best things about the Whaler is its location. The north side of the Whaler is wonderfully quiet yet less than a 2 minute walk to the ocean, pool, exercise room or spa and a 5 minute walk to the Whaler shopping area and restaurants. Black Rock, a fantastic place to snorkel, is just 5 minutes down the beach. Number 118 is a studio and a very nice accommodation.

She immediately found us another room, on the top floor, where we enjoyed a stunning view!    Our 12th floor room had a full kitchen with a Murphy bed, which was very comfortable. The furnishings were lovely and the room very clean. From start to finish, customer service at this hotel was amazing! I did call again on the second day because our room had not been made up by 4 PM and was asked if I wanted to set a time for our room to be done.

The rooms were clean, recently renovated and very affordable considering the location. The bathroom, shower and kitchen were all remodeled with new tile, granite and stainless steel appliances.

140177235,50,Very nice! Our second stay here.,"This is our second time staying at the Whaler. We were very pleased with room 516. The hotel/condo rooms are all a little different. I assume they are owned by individual people. Our room was a garden view in Tower 1. From the lanai you could see the ocean to the left. The rooms are just a tad old, but also have upgrades like granite countertops and new appliances. They have a nice homey feel to them. We traveled with a 6 month old and the Whaler supplied a fold up crib. The only thing we thought was odd was they gave us a king bed size sheet for the crib. The room had a king size bed, a couch, dining table, full kitchen, nice size walk in closet and bar with stools. There was a free safe all the kitchen utensils you would need. There was free Internet, but you had to pull the wire around the bed and set it on a nightstand to get it to work. Plus I had to call the IP provider to get it to work. The building had free WiFi as well, but we couldn’t get it to work anywhere in the hotel. Overall we really enjoyed our stay, the grounds are very nice with Plumeria trees and tropical plants. The pool is not huge or as fancy as a Sheraton or Hyatt, but it was never jam packed with people either. This property is more for families and older couples which was nice in our opinion. The parking lot is underground at $12 a day. It is nice since there are shopping carts in the garage so you can put your groceries etc… in them and make one trip to your room. When you pull out of the parking lot the gate attendants always give you a “Shaka” sign, AKA “Hang loose” on the mainland. We always get a kick out of that. The beach is beautiful and just steps out the door with the famous Black Rock just to the right of the Whaler.

The shopping next door was nice to have, nothing in size or numbers of people like we saw in Waikiki but it has plenty of stores to find things for all the people on your souvenir list. There is a small food court with a Subway and a couple other places and an ABC store where you can get the basics if you don't want to travel the short distance to the grocery store. Having Leilani's and the Hula Grill right next door was perfect for happy hours, dinner or late night. The beach was great, you can see and easily walk to Black Rock for some great snorkeling, rent paddleboards or catch one of the trips on the catamarans right outside the Whaler.    We will definitely go back to Maui and we will most likely stay at the Whaler 656 if we can. We went without our teenage kids but they will go on the next trip, kids of all ages will have a blast here. You could stay at the Whaler for a week and not have leave in a car if you didn't want to but we ventured out often to eat (Aloha Plate in Lahaina, Lahaina Coolers,cafe O'Lei in Kihei) and sight see (Pai'a, Upcountry, Haleakala Crater) and renewed our vows on Charley Young beach (highly recommend ""Always Maui'd"" for vow renewals or a wedding)",Aug 2012,June 2012,Traveled as a couple,,Maryland
136518137,40,Nice location,"We stayed at the Whaler for close to a month in July. We have two young kids, 10 and 6. I write reviews for people with younger kids. First the location is awesome. Great beach access and right near Whaler Village shopping which is great. The rooms are spacious and comfortable and patios are very big. Overall, we were very happy with our stay. The beach in front and access to Black Rock is great. There were a few negatives from a families perspective. We purposely booked a ground floor unit so the kids could play on lawn. When we got there we were told no throwing balls of any sort on lawn, this was a disappointment. Management was constantly coming out and telling kids no ball play. Also, the pool is small, which is fine, but deep. The shallowist part is 4ft. Which is deep for younger kids. Also, no pool toys of any kind, not even toys to dive for. If your older, single or no kids all the rules work fine, but I am writing this to let families of young kids no the rules. Also, I heard older people complain a lot about kids at the pool being to loud, which from my view I never expeienced. For us, we always found lounge chairs and never had problems parking in garage. Overall, it is nice place and kaanapali is the best area and best beaches. Next time we would book at a hotel/condo with bigger and more kid friendly pool.",Aug 2012,July 2012,Traveled with family,,"Phoenix, Arizona"
136315052,40,Another great vacation,"My family and I have stayed at the Whaler for 20+ years, and it is still one of the best spots on the beach. Great location for shops/restaurants...little bit of a hike for groceries, but if you stock up or have a car it is easy.    The golf courses are nice, however pricey and over-rated. I am not a low handicap golfer and can break 100 on the courses. They also tend to have too many on the course and do not monitor the play...taking 5 hours some days to finish a round. Very pricey and won't give you any deals...even though they are not full at times.    The rooms at the Whaler are getting dated, they did a major reno on the exterior and it looks nice...hopefully last another 25 years! But the rooms depending on the unit you get is dated and some are in need of an overhaul. The Whaler needs to be on top of this more...there was mold down the garbage disposal causing a stink in the room...if you didn't know what it was you would have sworn it to be a sewage problem. Pillows are little cotton fluff if you rent from the Whaler, rent privately and you are taking a chance too...bring your own if you have trouble with bad pillows...or ask before you rent.    There are also TONS of children, and although they are supposed to monitored and watched, nobody enforces that rule, and the evenings at the pool are extremely loud and kids running/jumping on each other unsupervised at 9-10 yrs old. People also go down the minute the pool opens to save chairs for the day...even though it says towels will be removed after 30 minutes of no use...again nobody enforces the rules and the owners/regulars rule! :( BBQ's are especially at sunset hour lined up...maybe the condo association could look at adding one or two more to each site and that would solve the problem.    Otherwise a great property, great sound buildings, sound really doesn't travel and pretty quiet in the evenings.    I will return to Whaler time and time again!

The kitchen is fully stocked with everything you could imagine....yes, there's a wine bottle opener as well.

133874667,40,Great place to stay but......,"My wife and I stayed at the Whaler from June 13th to July 2nd. We have stayed a few times before and always love going there. The location is the best in West Maui and with Whaler's Village a few steps away, you just can't beat it. Our unit was on the 12th floor and it was a wrap around corner unit so we had amazing views of pretty much everything. The unit we stayed in was recently renovated and like brand new. The exterior of the building also had a massive overhaul done with all units getting new lanai's, railings and new balcony doors and screens (on most units). It also had cement patching and a fresh coat of paint. The buildings look really good.    The only complaint I have of The Whaler is the pool area. It is simply too small for the number of units in the complex. You literally have to be down at the pool to get a lounger right at 8am when the staff unlock the gates. The pool itself is OK however it is not cleaned regularly enough and many times there would be sunscreen grease floating on the surface and ""pooling up"" in the corners. That was a huge turn off. I also found the staff that run the towel shack to be too young and rude. They are not Whaler staff (who are excellent by the way) as it is a company contracted out to distribute towels, sell expensive sun-screen and even more expensive beach loungers.    But at the end of the day, you can't go wrong with The Whaler and it's also a great place to meet new people during barbecuing.

132514307,40,Almost Perfect,"Spent 4 days at The Whaler in a waterfront apartment. The apartment was extremely well appointed and we did not want for anything. It was on a corner next to Whalers Village so had a wrap around balcony, great in almost any weather. A little noisy in the evenings but did not affect our sleep at all as the doors shut out the sounds of happy souls enjoying their holidays.    Biggest problem we encountered was the apparently normal lack of clean beach towels. On our first day we went to collect towels at around 10.30am, no clean towels and they would not arrive from the laundry until about noon. Staff blamed the laundry, but obviously there are just not enough towels. Flabbergasted, as I had never encountered this problem at any other resort anywhere in the world, I went to reception with my problem. They were no more helpful until I insisted I required towels. They gave one beach towel they found and then after more insisting, gave me a white bath towel, but very unwillingly. This is totally unacceptable at a beach resort. We noticed many people having the same problem over the next few days. Hint - don't give up your towels, just change them for clean ones and collect your towel ticket prior to check out.    The situation of the resort was great, handy to restaurants, boat trips and a beautiful beach for swimming.    All in all, a lovely resort in a fabulous position marred by somewhat unhelpful staff on reception and perhaps inexperienced management.    On checking out we also had a problem with incorrect resort charges which after some discussion were removed as we had a private let.",Jun 2012,June 2012,Traveled as a couple,Hang on to your beach towels as they constantly run out.

132492188,50,Great stay at The Whaler,"We just got back from a great stay at The Whaler. We booked a 1 bedroom condo (using Travelocity) with Aston, rather than an owner. The unit (956, ocean view, tower 2, facing Black Rock, gorgeous view, pretty much ""the postcard"" and the thumbnail I see above) was much bigger than we expected. The bedroom alone was bigger than most hotel rooms we've stayed in. The kitchen was well equipped and nothing seemed worn out in any way. The hideaway bed in the living room was probably queen-sized.  I know The Whaler just concluded a renovation, and really everything looked nice. (Not 'beautiful-nice', just 'very-pleasant' nice, clean, and in great condition.) The balcony was huge and had plenty of seating. The room had good A/C, and we could even hear the waves even with the sliding doors shut and AC running. There were books, TVs and DVD players.  Other site features we used were the pleasant pool (not enough chairs ), a little fitness center, grills (which we used on a prior stay), and free DVDs. (I think some of those are only if you book with Aston) The view of the grounds from up above was very tranquil.    The location is awesome. The beach is very nice (though a bit rough for our girl). Whaler Village (adjacent with a secret shortcut) has the ubiquitous ABC store, food (Subway & McD up to high end restaurants) and many high-end shops (which are less of a draw to me than the ABC store) Black Rock has awesome snorkeling, The Kaanapali Boardwalk is right there next to the pool (though I wish the pool staff was a bit more attentive in keeping out those who were staying at neighboring properties.)    Lahaina is a short drive. We stocked up for a week of food at the Safeway there, There's definitely enough to do in Lahaina, so we ended up there for some part of the day about half of our days there.    I think we managed to use a ""welcome back"" pricing option because the 1-bedroom unit was less than half of classic ""ocean view hotel rooms"" at the surrounding Sheraton and Westin.

132153658,20,Beware renting thru VRBO! Property is noisy and pool chairs not available,"We used VRBO to rent unit 470 at The Whaler for 9 days in May 2012. The condo had problems, and this property has some issues; I don't think we would stay here again. The biggest problem was that we rented thru VRBO instead of booking directly with the property. When we had problems, the front desk referred us to the owner's agent, Whaler's Realty, and they were not at all helpful. There was no cleaning service, which would have been OK, but that meant no clean towels, and they only gave us 4 towels for 3 people for 9 days. When I called the agent to ask about this, they suggested we have a mid-stay cleaning for $67, but we didn't need cleaning, we just needed towels! I guess guests are expected to wash the towels themselves, but there was no w/d in the condo, only a shared w/d for the entire floor, and it cost $3 per load and was pretty much always in use. We ended up using the pool towels. Also, the VRBO listing said this unit had a separate entrance for the bedroom, but the front desk couldn't make a key for that door, so you could leave the unit from there, but couldn't re-enter, so that was a misrepresentation. The condo itself needs an update; the sofabed was completely worn out and was tortorus to sleep on - we ended up putting the mattress on the floor, which made the LR unusable. The linens for both beds were old, torn and didn't fit, ended up on the bare mattress every morning - yuck! No blanket for the sofabed. No hot water in the bathroom sink. The place really needs a remodel/update. The view from this unit is lovely: the courtyard, black rock, the beach. However, the property is very noisy; between lawn maintenance equipment, road and shopping center noise, construction and frequent visits from garbage trucks, the place never seems to have a quiet moment. Also, when it is windy, the wind really whips thru the courtyard, sometimes all night and day. The pool was nice - right next to the beach, clean, but we quit trying to use it because there are a limited number of chairs, and they were all claimed early in the morning by people who left towels on them but didn't show up for hours, so many guests wanting to use the pool had no place to sit while surrounded by empty, towel covered chairs. Ridiculous! The Whaler needs some kind of monitoring system to allow the guests who are actually at the pool to have somewhere to sit!

Check it out on vrbo.    Lots of space in this suite, the king bedroom is like a separate suite and you can close the door for privacy. The beds are very comfortable -- even the murphy bed is great! The extra-large sized lanai was a great place to enjoy coffee every morning with a million dollar view of Black Rock and Molokai. Two bathrooms means no waiting. Fully stocked kitchen so you can eat in if you like -- but plenty of great restaurant choices nearby. Don't pack a lot of clothes --- the in suite washer & dryer is very convenient. The furniture is all very nice -- definitely fitting for Hawaii. It was nice to have some beach items -- chairs, mats, sunshade, even a cooler -- to take along to the beach. We even tried out the boogie boards. The photos on vrbo tell the story -- what you see is what you get. The owner was very quick to respond to questions -- and I had a lot of questions before I rented this unit! The staff at The Whaler are very friendly and helpful -- even though I was renting direct from an owner, I received the same level of service as other guests. No issues at all with parking, although if you arrive back late (after 9 PM), you may be in the overflow lot. That's no big deal, it is only about 100 feet away.

I was a little disappointed in the bath towels, hand towels and wash clothes were super worn some of them didn't even look clean, to be honest they look like what I dry my car off after I wash it.

130414328,30,Not the Place for Me,"I was in Maui in November of 2011. Sorry this has taken so long for me to write, but life just got in the way. The Whaler is located on one of Maui's most beautiful beaches and right next to Whaler's Village. Those are pretty much the two best things about the place. I went when there was construction and I knew this when I was going. What I didn't know was how beyond loud it was going to be. I wasn't worried, because we were planning on being out most days so no big deal. I wouldn't do this again because some mornings it was a race to have breakfast and get our the doors because in all my life I have never experienced that kind of construction noise! The condo itself was nice and it had everything a person needs but the odd cockroach. I could live without them, but its not the first time I have encountered them in a tropical setting and I did talk to an owner about it and he told me they regularly treat for them. Since construction there has been a few more sightings.  The cleaning staff were great. We always had to ask for things like dish clothes and such but who cares, not a big deal. Now on to the front desk staff. Well my first impression was very good. Beck greeted us, gave us the run down and we discussed getting a later check out on our last day. I had requested it via email already but she told me to come and see her the day before that time and it would likely not be an issue.  Our stay at the Whaler was noisy because of the construction, but also because we were located on the ground floor right next to the sliding doors to outside. The sliding doors that got increasingly louder as days went by. As construction proceeded more rubble fell on to our lanai. Every day I had to sweep it up so we could sit out and have our morning coffee. I wasn't even bothered by this as I was in Maui, so who cares right.  On our last couple of days in paradise I came down with a nasty flu. (Thank you young man on Haleakala for coughing all over everyone and anyone without covering your mouth) Anyway, I went to the front desk and told them I was feeling quite ill and could I please see about a late check out on our last day as our flight was not until 10:30 at night. I was told (not by Beck, she was off work that day) but by another lady, I don't recall her name, that we could not stay later as it was booked. I knew it was not booked as the construction workers were almost at our floor and they did not book the rooms once they got to the lanai they were working on. I knew they were getting to our lanai as I got up on our last day BEFORE we even checked out and opened my doors to step out on to my lanai. I walked right into all the patio furniture. They had moved it all up in front of the doors and I almost broke my neck tripping over it. This upset me. I went to the front desk and still being polite asked again and told them I knew they were not re-booking because of the construction men. The same woman says to me too bad. If you book though a travel company then if owner shows up we kick you out. So in a nut shell I would not stay here again and I would not recommend it. The front desk service is appalling. I have worked in that industry in the past for many years and NEVER would we not accommodate a guest who was ill. We would find something. Period. I am not a fussy traveler in the least. I never complain, but the service at the front desk speaks volumes to me and the service here stunk.  Some helpful tips about Maui:    Shop for groceries at Cosco, Walmart or Foodland. Give Foodland your phone number at you will receive a discount. Don't worry no one calls you from Maui trying to sell you anything.    When you rent a car in Maui, bring your insurance from home. If you have Road Star Plus you can opt out of the extremely expensive insurance. It will save you around $500 bucks!    Shop at the markets held throughout the week and on Saturdays. You are not going to spend a lot of money like you may think. Besides you are buying local and supporting the local economy. Its the right thing to do. Don't buy on your first days. Wait until you see the prices all over and take note of the less expensive places. Prices jackknife all over the place.    Look for coupons to eat out and don't be afraid to ask restaurants if they hand out coupons. Moose McGillicutty's is a big win! Lots of food for your money and they have two for one breakfast coupons in some flyers around the island.    Take the Hana Highway tour with Valley Isle. Ask for Tim. He is a fun knowledgeable guy and he takes all your pictures for you. We had a lot fun with him and we were very glad we didn't do the trip ourselves. Tim is an awesome driver!!!!!    We did the Feast at Lele luau. Well worth the money!    We rented a car and drove and drove and talked to locals and saw so much in our two week trip it is hard to share it all on here. We loved Maui!!!!!!    Maui is wonderful. I will be going back as soon as the budget allows. I will NOT be staying at the Whaler.

Some of my family had stayed here before, and their recommendation didn't disappoint! The location is located close to Black Rock and all of the vistas/snorkelling that offers, but The Whaler is also centrally located next to a variety of restaurants, bars, and shops.    Since we were some of the younger travellers in our group, I was unsure if Kaanapali would be a good fit for 30-somethings since West Maui is typically a family-friendly destination. We ended up having a great time! The Whaler rooms offer gorgeous views no matter where you stay - we stayed in Tower 1 on the Black Rock side, and enjoyed ocean and mountain views off the lanai. The hotel was recently updated and offers a beautiful center garen area with koi ponds. I couldn't get over how close to the beach we were given the rate we rented our studio condo for!    If staying here, check out Leilani's beach bar for a great happy hour and tasty food. We also had a great dinner at Longboard's which is part of Marriot's vacation village not far down the esplanade. The esplanade walkway along the ocean was lovely to walk any time of day, especially in the mornings when hunting for coffee (tip: there is a free-standing Starbuck's just past the Kaanapali Ali resort).

This was our first time renting through VRBO, and we liked that we could choose the actual unit that we were to stay in. Since each unit is individually owned, they vary significantly in their decor so if this is important to you then it is good to know.    Our unit was on the 7th floor back corner of Tower 1, facing north towards Black Rock with a view off the back lanai of the west Maui mountains. This unit had a great breeze since it was on the corner of the building where the wind blew in from, although the morning sun made it surprising hot to sit out in the morning. We did not have a great view of the beach or the path, and a slightly obstructed view of Black Rock. If the unit was a floor or two higher, or closer to the front of the building, the views would have been much better.    The unit itself was great. Clean, spacious, fairly recently remodeled, fully stocked with all of the basic amenities needed - except beach chairs. There was only one, very small and cheap beach chair. It would have been a nice touch to have 2 or 4 good beach chairs in the unit for guests to use. We didn't need, but liked, having two bathrooms. The extra space with a one bedroom unit instead of a studio was nice too. The lanai is very large since it's a corner unit, although all of the units at the Whaler have large lanais.    There is underground parking at the Whaler, but not enough spots for every guest so if you get back later in the evening you have to park outdoors in the overflow lot, a very short walk from the building. This was not really any inconvenience or much further to walk. Overnight parking fees are $12 in addition to the unit rental, regardless of whether you're in the underground garage or the overflow lot.    The location is fantastic, right on Kaanapali Beach. The pool is fairly small for a property of this size, but that is one big difference between a resort and a condo property. You pay for the convenience of a full kitchen and more space, not for acres and acres of groomed property, park-like pools, and service. We did spend the second half of our trip at a resort in Wailea as well as one night in Hana.",Apr 2012,April 2012,Traveled as a couple,"Units on the inside/courtyard have better views of the beach and better sun, but they also face...","Buffalo, New York"

127958301,50,WOW! I shall return when I come back to Maui,"Stayed at the Whaler for 3 days because hubby wanted a beachfront accommodation. I was initially looking for a location in Lahaina town but I am so glad we stayed here because it was just so nice to wake up with the fresh breeze blowing through the apartment (aircon was available but we didn't use it), with the sound of the wave and the sun rising from the mountain side. We didn't want to leave!    Tell them if you have a special event e.g. honeymoon and you'll receive ""amenities"" a bottle of red, macadamia biscuits, chocolates, glasses, mugs, coffee ... it was special! In addition (if you have time) you can hire a free DVD a day.    Room rates were definitely more reasonable for the same view along the boardwalk ... other accommodation like the Sheraton/Westin were only a hop-skip-and-a-jump away.    Very happy with the accommodation, and would be happy to recommend to young or old couples, families ... groups of friends.    It was also convenient to have the Hula Grill, Leilani's, Starbucks not too far away.

Location is right on the Kaanapali Beach with Whaler's Village right next door. Views were great and weather beautiful.  Cons - ammenties were only so so. Pool is small with limited chairs that were full by 8 am. Exercise facility was not worth visiting. We received clean towels each day, but unit was cleaned only once during our stay. We required a late checkout on our last day and even though the room was not booked, we were charged almost a full day rate. Renovations were still going on and if you were in your unit during the day it was annoying. For the price per night, I expected a little more.  This was our first trip to Maui and if you are looking for a party, this is not the place to go. Restaurants closed at 9:30 and nothing else going on.

127168465,40,Whaley great,"We stayed in 1116 in Tower 1 - lovely large studio with a gloriously big lanai with plenty of chairs - a nice spot to watch the whales. I was worried about space when we booked a studio, but I shouldn't have been - there was lots of storage space ( a separate little room), a nice big sofa, a table and a big bed, and none of it felt crammed in. The kitchen area was very well-appointed, though we only used dishwasher and microwave. The shower was spacious and above a bath - - though a small request - could there a soap dish?? There was a nice welcome touch - water and pre-cut pineapple in the fridge, and a free wi-fi connection and safe in the room. Front desk was very friendly and efficient, as was the daily maid service. We were near the lifts, but there was no noise, and every floor had a trash room and a washing machine room handily placed next to the lift. In the underground parking lot there is also an extensive re-cycling station, and all the entrances are activated by key cards. The grounds are beautifully kept and u can feed the fish in the pond (food available at reception ).Lots of people seemed to use the pool - we couldn't see why until we got a couple of really windy days, when you were sandblasted on the beach!  The place is right next to Whalers Village for shopping and food - though eating is expensive there( apart from the McDonalds & pizza place in Whaler's food court) . If you've got a car, go to Teddy's burgers in the shopping centre opposite Lahaina Cannery Mall - absolutely beautiful burgers with an amazing choice of sizes, toppings, varieties - the works. We also had a great breakfast a Lu Lu's in the Lahaina Cannery Mall itself.  All in all, the Whaler is a great, value choice for this area - I would certainly go again, but maybe request an inner tower room, as the views are better from those sides of the buildings( not that ours wasn't nice as we had requested an ocean view and got one )",Apr 2012,March 2012,Traveled as a couple,"Request an inner tower room, as the views are better from those sides of the buildings",London
126770383,40,"Nice Property, but construction detracted","We just finished a two-week stay at the Whaler. This was our third time staying at this property. The unit we rented was 579 in the South Tower. As with the previous times, we found the unit through VRBO, and dealt directly with the owner. The unit was a nicely furnished one-bedroom with stainless steel appliances. It also had an in-unit washer and dryer. The owner had also equipped the unit with beach chairs, swim masks and fins, sand pails and shovels and boogie boards.    We find staying at the Whaler a much better value than say the Westin (which we have also stayed at) in terms of space, and the flexibility of preparing a meal or two in the condo. To me, the only thing that you give up is the spectacular pool that most hotels have. If you like swimming in the ocean, as we do, then you're not giving up anything.    Our only criticism was construction related. There were construction vehicles and construction noise going on the south side of the south tower. Although the construction was limited to 8:00 am to 5:00 am, it still made sitting out on the lanai less enjoyable. The other issue was parking. Due to the construction, the Whaler has temporary lost about 40 parking spots. It was almost always impossible to get an indoor spot. But also the outdoor overflow parking lot was sometimes full too. On 5 occasions, the Whaler sent us to park next door at Whalers' Village. Although the Whaler provided us with a free parking pass for Whalers' Village, we were still required to move the car from the Whaler Village parking lot by 9:00 am the next morning, or we'd have to pay extra. If you added up the time to scour the parking lot for a spot, then find out there isn't something available, then get a parking pass for Whalers' Village, then park over there, and then retrieve your car the next morning, and then re-park it -- was about a 25 minute exercise! My request to have parking fees refunded fell on deaf ears.    It appears that the construction is about 2 to 4 weeks from being completed, so it is unlikely that you will encounter the same problems if your stay is from May onwards.    As mentioned before, this was our third stay. Twice on the north side of the north tower, and this time on the south side of the south tower. The north side units have a nice view of Black Rock. However, the units do not face the sun, and we found them to be dark. And, depending upon how high up you are, you may face into the rooms at the Kaanapali Beach Hotel next door.    This time, we faced Whalers Village. The unit had sun on the lanai for pretty much the entire day. Our unit was on the 5th floor, and our view was not obstructed by the buildings over at Whalers Village. Plus the Westin is far enough away that you really felt like you had some privacy on your balcony. However, a few times, depending upon how the wind was blowing, you could distinctly smell the smoke and cooking smells that were vented through the roof of the Hula Grill next door. If you're staying on the south side of the south tower, I wouldn't want to be any lower than the 5th floor, and certainly the higher the better. If we return to this property, I would probably pick the south side of the south tower again.    Our favourite activities on this trip:  *Trilogy sail boat trip (and snuba) at Lanai  *Flyin' Hawaiian zipline  *Kayak whale watching expedition  *Kupuhana Magic Show (for the kids)    Favourtie restaurants:  *Lahina Grill (pricey but worth it)  *David Paul's Island Grill (a close second to Lahina Grill)  *Colleens (in Haiku)  *Sea House (great breakfasts)",Mar 2012,March 2012,Traveled with family,,Toronto

126165015,50,Expensive but worth every penny!,"Spent 7 nights in condo 473 which is an almost 2000sq foot condo with wrap around lanai. Our unit was on the fourth floor with mountain views although excellent view of the beach and sunset was also had!    Was traveling with a group of four friends so we wanted extra personal space hence getting such a large condo We each shared a bedroom with another person. My room had a larger than a king bed and the other room had a king bed plus a cot at no extra cost.    The layout was excellent with large living area and kitchen and dining room. I was worried that the unit would have dated furnishings but to my suprise was very modern and new looking. We had two washrooms both a nice size. The shower in the master bathroom is not senior friendly. There is quite the step to climb into and out of this raised combo tub shower. Alternatively the second bathroom has a stand alone shower.    The lanai was so large we didn't even use the rear section of it! The side section had a dining table with chairs  and a few loungers that were well used.    Maid service is daily and the place was kept sand less. Very respectful cleaning staff. The grounds of the property are maintained to a very high standard as well.    Most of the outdoor facade renovations seem to be complete however there was still some landscaping going on but the work was done at decent times as not to disturb guests too early or too late.    Check in was a breeze as was booking on the Aston website. No hidden fees on checkout.    Parking is a hot commodity with overflow outdoor parking which could be a hassle.    The pool and hot tub were clean although chlorine based. Large decks available as well as towel service and beach activity desk to make reservations.    Excellent beach although very wavy while we were there. I loved the waves, my friends stayed near the pool. The black rock near the hotel was fabulous for snorkelling.    The Whalers Villiage Shopping centre was convenient as were the restaurants nearby. There is a $1 shuttle from the entrance Of the villiage to the town of Lahaina a few miles away. Very convenient.

The package included air fare from Edmonton and hotel accommodation. I booked a car rental using Expedia as it was the best rate. This was my second visit to Maui. On my first trip we stayed in Kihei. Decided this time to stay in the Kaanapali area as I didn't get a chance to check this area out in my prior visit. I have to say that I did prefer this area compared to Kihei.    We arrived Sunday evening and were welcomed and checked in promptly by the hotel staff. Other than our check out, which was equally as prompt and courteous, we didn't really have any other interaction with the staff.    We stayed in a studio apartment which was located in Tower 1 on the 7th floor. The suite was a perfect size for the 2 of us and included some recent upgrades. We had some welcome snacks waiting for us when we arrived. The building, grounds, lobby, and suite were all very clean and well kept. We had a large lanai that had a great view of the ocean and the top of black rock (another condo building obstructed the lower area of black rock). We were able to see many whales just from sitting having our coffee on the lanai.    There is still some construction going on in Tower 2, but it's not significant. We would overhear some construction noise during the day from our Lanai, but it did not deter from our experience.    The pool appeared busy, with many people getting up early to get a lounge chair. We didn't spend anytime at the pool as we preferred the ocean. We had no problems getting towels from the pool staff throughout the day. There were 2 barbeque areas (one beside Tower 1 and the other beside Tower 2). They were well used by hotel guests.    The beach right outside is a great place to swim, paddle board, body board and even snorkel. I saw a turtle swimming about as well as many whales passing sometimes only 100 or so yards away. The waves can be rough at times and does drop off quite quickly. Probably not a great swimming area for small children.    Whaler's Village shopping center is right next door with loads of stores and restaurants. We enjoyed The Cane & Taro for breakfast. We also went to the Hula Grill which was very good (preferred the bar side as prices were more reasonable than the dining room - also had great live entertainment during the day). We also went Leilani's which was also very good (again both the dining room and bar were good choices). Be prepared to spend some decent $$ if you are planning on dining out. There are of course many grocery stores that you can use to stock your fridge - expect to pay top dollar for groceries.

124458990,40,Pleasantly surprised!,My husband and I have just return from a stay at The Whaler on Kaanapali Beach and are pleased to say that we had a great experience from the time we checked in until we checked out a week later. We stayed in a privately owned studio unit which was VERY roomy and had a good sized balcony with a partial ocean view. This was the first time we have stayed South of Black Rock and are pleased to say we will definitely be returning to The Whaler.  The only negative I can come up with is get to the pool early if you want a decent chair and the pool towels are a bit limited so again a good idea to get there early (the pool is unlocked at 8A ish). The final phase of this latest round of renovations is just about complete on tower 2 with a hopeful completion date of February 29th (time will tell).  Over all we greatly enjoyed our stay and will definitely be returning to The Whaler again! Mahalo,Feb 2012,February 2012,Traveled as a couple,,"Salem, Oregon"
124405934,30,Vacation in Paradise disappointment,"This rental unit could quite easily get 5 Stars but, loses out because a few short falls. It is clean,has an excellent view/location. The kitchen is very dated and, the utinsels looked like they where bought on the last day of a garage sale. The frying pans have very little Teflon left. (I can show pictures) The stove is about 17 years old. The left front ring keeps falling into the pit. This can be very dangerous with children or adults while cooking. The door under the sink keeps falling off.  The ceiling over the bath has gaps that let the dirt fall on you while showering.  This unit needs to be updated and, the least the owner should do is proper maintenance.  Would I rent this unit again. No.",Feb 2012,January 2012,Traveled with family,,Oradell

123815975,40,Just right,"The Whaler was just what I wanted, although I did not know it. It is great as much for what it isn't, as much as what it is.    I rented a studio condo unit from the owner for the second week of December, just before high season. Real value. It was spotless, with a great balcony view.    The first night was a treat. Arrived, easy check-in, walked left next door to the outdoor Hula Grill. Dinner at the edge of a lawn, a path, lush bushes, and the ocean right behind. Welcome!    It's only 100 yards from Black Rock, so if you like to snorkel, get up at sunrise (when the fish are having breakfast undisturbed and the tourists are snoring). And if you want, you can walk the path along the resorts from the Sheraton to the Hyatt, pop in, check them all out, check out the prices, and flee.    The Whaler has a nice, modest pool where people get together during the day. The guests and owners mostly (not all) are adults 50+, very friendly, welcome kids and grand kids, AOK. Very wide, clean, uncrowded beach. Near Lahaina. Lahaina: don't miss the Annabell comedy show--witty, funny, fresh, and with a baffling musical secret. A+. Honest!    What I especially liked is the Whaler is human size. It's not a big, fabu, look-at-me, institution. I felt at home. The landscaping is pretty, and adequate. It does not have a lot of facilities or add-ons. Laundry, fitness, plenty of parking underground, soft drinks, yes. Restaurant: no--so what? I wanted to tour and discover, who needs more? My Maui is ""less is more"". I love the air, the ocean, visiting with the sea creatures, the variety, discovery, the flowers. Lodging that is imposing is a distraction and gets in the way. It was just right for me. If you want to get knighted, and pay like a king, you won't be happy here. Nice touches, no pretense.    I wanted it on Ka'anapali Beach. The only other condo is the Al'li--nice but much more expensive, and the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel is a hotel. I liked saving money using the full kitchen and the outdoor BBQ, and the coffee for guests at the pool in the morning. Do stay off their internet, though--it's way too expensive.    I toured all the hotels on Ka'anapali, north of the Sheraton to Kapalua and the Ritz, Lahaina, Kehei, and the Wailea resorts. I would come back here before the others. I liked it. I'm just a regular guy, with Southern efficiency and Northern charm. The Whaler: nice, lovely site and location, and nice people.

The beds comfortable, the sound of the surf makes one so relaxed...Getting to know how to turn on all the lights is a bit tricky, but if this is all I can say in a the remotely negative vein, shame on me! Every detail of this condo has been thought out and the decor is just beautiful. The location is within walking distance of Whaler's village and all the Resort hotels in the area. We stopped by Costco before we went to the condo, and to be honest, I never wanted to leave. Having the washer/dryer was so helpful. The bathrooms were so beautiful...I could go on and on.

The whaler is a condo, each one is owned by a person or group that may or may it maintain the unit the same as the next.  The Whaler is a laid back lifestyle where you are not hit up at every trip to the beach to buy a timeshare. The Hotel/condo is dead center on the beach, perfect views of the islands next door. Nope there is no bar, bring your own in an insulated mug and enjoy without the cost or tip.  Renovation, yes it is still going on and the 8th floor tower 2 will be done on the 31st of January. Ya it would be nice to have it done but we knew this going in and the owner took care of us. Why are you oh going to Hawaii and sitting inside anyway?? If you want all sorts of nightlife walk down the beach and party down. If you want a perfect place that you can relax and bring the kids this is a great place.

122487436,20,Many issues,"We arrived at The Whaler on Christmas Eve, keep in mind we made our reservations 10 months ago. We were first given a room in Tower 2-ocean front, which was great, except for the next 9 days we would not be able to open our patio door or go outside on the balcony due to the construction. Who wants to spend 9 days in Hawaii without opening a door or stepping outside on your balcony. Back to the front desk. Was then put in Tower 1 but only could stay in this room for 2 nights and then we would have to move. Our view was of construction and had sugar ants in the kitchen when we moved in. We were told at the front desk this was normal.    On the 3rd day was moved to another room. We did get a $100 restaurant gift certificate for all the inconveniences.    Parking was always an issue, most of the week we had to park at the outside parking lot and walk.    Don't count on a beach towel, 2 days there were no towels by 10 in the morning.    Housekeeping was just okay, always had to ask for more towels.    Location is great though.    Overall I am not sure I would recommend this facility, we had to spend 3 days of our vacation getting issues resolved and everything that could have gone wrong did.    We overheard many upset individuals due to the construction. We were told construction was suppose to be done the first part of December. It was just a disappointing experience for our first trip to Hawaii especially since we had been planning it for so long.",Jan 2012,December 2011,,,Michigan

When we opened our door to the room it was very new smelling, new paint, carpets etc.. but the balcony was blocked closed from the outside, balcony was not quite finished.    OK fine deal with it the room seemed nice.. until we turned on the water in the sink... brown... then we turned on a light, or attempted to turn on a light... no light bulbs in the lamps, OK deal with it... then as we were unpacking, the next thing we know we have a construction worker standing on our balcony. . UGH.. down to the lobby to pass on this information to the front desk.    Was met by a nice young lady who apologized about our misfortunes. We were given the opportunity to check out late the day we were leaving as our flight was late at night, this at no addition cost. The water was just run to clear up the line, again due to construction and the bulbs were not addressed. The late check out was a good situation for us but when we went to check out the front office acted as though they had not heard anything about our agreement with the manager, (we were told 'notes' would be put in our account) so we again had to wait until a manager showed up and make things right.

Instead of placing them midway between the walkway and the water, as other resorts do, they place them right near the edge of the water. This blocks the view of the ocean for anyone else on the beach, who doesn't rent a cabana. They have refused to move the cabanas back a little farther and have been very rude when asked. They have also ""run out"" of towels every day for several hours at a time. This has never happened in past years, and there are fewer people here this year because of the construction.

It is a farse!  The people that hand out the towels are unfriendly and even rude if you act surprised they are out of towels. They just want to rent you a lounge, cabana, umbrella or sell you some $$ sunglasses or lotion.  If you have little kids you better grab towels from the room to bring to the pool or beach.

It had a nice balcony which you could look straight at Tower 2, or if you looked to the left you would see the beach/ocean/ and black rock.  Very comfortable king bed. Enough kitchen supplies to cook dinner if you wanted too.  Location is great right on the beach. The Whaler shopping center is right next door with restaurants that you could just walk down too. (if you eat twice at the Leilani's, you will get a huge piece of ""hula pie"" for free. It's fantastic! Shopping is great right next to the Whaler.  Free dvds in the evening to watch...pretty current movies too.  Never used the hottub, but it seemed quite large.  Only five mins down the road to the cute Lahaina downtown. All the shopping you could ask for. Grocery store and drug stores also. FYI. if you are going to go to the grocery store, make sure that you sign up for the ""card"" at the SAFEWAY. We didn't, and they wouldn't give us the store specials. Food is very expensive compared to what we pay on the mainland.  Missed the chairs on the beach, though. They were just at the pool which did seem quite crowded.  This was not just a place to sit on the beach all day. The time of year that we went it was always windy, cool by 3:30 in the afternoon, and the sand sometimes was really blowing.

Stating ""Construction Price"" does not do it justice as construction can be painting, grounds work, carpet replacement, etc. What is going on now is significant heavy construction. No use of the balconies and having workmen getting off the work elevator staring into your living room is not fun. As we BBQ'ed at the community grills, almost everyone we met asked about what we were told by management/owners on the condition of the construction. About 50% of the folks we met had not even been told of the construction and the other 50% were not told the severity ==== lots of unhappy folks who, although they liked the location and amenities, will probably not return due to the ""shaddiness"" factor.

Sweeping ocean views with Lanai and Molokai looking close enough to touch. The sunsets are breathtaking too. This room is a one bedroom two bath condo with upgraded amenities and everything a traveler could want or need. I had originally booked a one bedroom one bath condo but was upgraded (without charge) to a one bedroom two bathroom condo. Since I booked my vacation package through the Aston hotels they might have upgraded me for free, but there is no harm in asking if you booked through someone else.    The location is perfect. Right next door to Whaler's Village shopping mall. Lots of gift shops and boutiques. I love strolling the beachwalk which connects to at least four other hotels. It is a little windy here but the air is warm and you will only need a light jacket or sweater in the evening.

We had hoped the construction would be near completion by the time of our stay as the hotel website stated that the expected completion was December 21st, 2011 but there is no way they will be done in two weeks. We were in tower 1 which seems to be almost complete but the work is still ongoing in tower 2, across the courtyard from our room. Construction goes from 8am to 5pm on weekdays and it is very, very noisy as they are jack hammering the tiled surface off of each of the balconies and since the buildings are concrete the sound reverberates and echos reaching insane volumes. For most people who are up early and exploring the island the construction wouldn't bother them but we like the sleep in and relax in our room while on vacation, not possible here. On our first day we had construction in the unit directly above us that involved debris falling through the suspended ceiling above the bathtub which was then vacuumed from above while I was having a shower; I've always wanted more shower friends!    There are some positives in regards to our stay; the rooms are all really large, we were in a one bedroom and one bath which was twice the size of our condo at home in Vancouver, the rooms all have kitchens with the bare essentials(bring your own salt and pepper!) and the views are outstanding. Housekeeping was great, Leilaini at the front desk was super nice and there is coin operated laundry on every floor.    The room itself was a bit out of date, we called it the Golden Girls Suite, the kitchen was original from 30 plus years ago with an updated fridge, dishwasher and microwave but the fridge looked like it fell off of truck and the dishwasher wasn't working properly for a couple of days.

I would recommend staying higher than 9th fl. We had great ocean view but we also had view of the roof of neighboring property and air unit was very loud. We also enjoyed the fact that it wasnt overly crowded here (maybe perk of renovation or just time of year). Also seemed that a lot of owners were here vs. Heavy tourists like at westin, etc. Which we enjoyed.

119109994,30,The Whaler under construction,"We have stayed here before and had rave reviews about the property. We still really enjoy staying here, but on our recent trip in October 2011 the Whaler is under construction. They are replacing the Lanai's. It will be really great when it is finished but right now the noise is horrible, they start from 8am-5pm. There was also another unit being renovated at the same time as the construction was going on that was 2 units over from the one we rented. As I was taking a shower I could hear people talking, really I couldn't wait to get out of the room.  If you are thinking about staying at the whaler ask for floors 9-12 in tower 1 or the interior units in tower 2 floors 1-4. The construction will be finished by Jan 1, but again I would not stay at the Whaler until they are finished.  We actually got a great price on our room, but realized that we couldn't even see the ocean and they had done very minimal in updating the appliances, looked like if something broke then they would fix it but they waited until things broke down. Once again, ask for the map of the Whaler to find out where the unit is.  A couple of things we did to get away from the Whaler was:  Magic show at the Kaanapali Beach hotel....this was fabulous!!!

Yes, it was a little noisy between 8:30 and 4pm during the week, but that's when we went on drives to other parts of the island and also went to the beach and to Whaler's Village. It was quiet after 4pm and all day on the weekends. As long as you remember you are on vacation and ""go with the flow"", you'll still have a great time. The sunsets are still gorgeous, you can still use the BBQ and have a million dollar view from the tables by the BBQs, and it's still a wonderful place to stay. And on the bright side -- the pool, parking lot and BBQ areas were not crowded due to a lot of the units not being occupied while the renovations are going on. We had a wonderful 10 day stay in late August!!",Sep 2011,August 2011,Traveled with family,,"Newport Beach, California"
118083196,20,Beware the construction noise!,The exterior of both tower blocks are under extensive renovation and it is very noisy between 8am and 5pm on weekdays. This was not disclosed when we made our renovation but the management did refund the remainder of our money after one nights stay and we moved elsewhere. There is also a $12 per day parking fee. Note that Tower 1 overlooks Whalers Village and it is very noisy due to both the air conditioning units in the mall and the thousands of Mynah birds who nest in the hedge between Tower 1 and the mall. The room we stayed in was also very dated. All in all there are better places to stay in Ka'anapali.,Sep 2011,August 2011,Traveled as a couple,,Seattle
117987914,40,Fantastic Accommodations on the Best Beach in Maui,"Stayed here with my wife and teenage son. The condo (1061) was VERY clean, decorated in an attractive, modern way, and the balcony looked south toward Lanai. We stayed for one week and put the kitchen to great use. It felt great to actually feel like we were at home, but in paradise at the same time. We wouldn't stay anywhere else on Maui other than in Kaanapali. The snorkling around black rock is phenomenal, spotting turtles everyday close to shore. The path along the beach was also nice for a morning run.",Sep 2011,June 2011,Traveled with family,South facing in the South tower worked for us...Lanai was beautiful from our room,"Portland, OR"
117956551,50,Amazing 18 Days in Maui!,"After spending several months looking for the best property on the island of Maui to host our 47 guests from all over the world for our wedding, we chose The Whaler on Ka'anapali Beach and it was perfection! From the moment we arrived, the staff could not have been more kind and helpful to us and all of our guests. The front desk staff and concierge were extremely accommodating and ensured that each and every guest was well attended to no matter what the request. The concierge was extremely helpful on several occasions when planning excursions or simply arranging dinner reservations and transportation around the island. Each and every guest was extremely pleased with their spacious and clean accommodations. The rooms at this resort provide ample space for families of all sizes and  lanais with breathtaking views no matter where your room was situated. The property itself  was kept in immaculate condition with beautiful gardens and landscaping. The barbecues  for guest use were always kept in pristine condition and provided a great space for  everyone to get together in the evenings. The pool area was always kept clean and was  attended to by very kind staff offering coffee and lemonade to guests throughout the day.  With regards to the location of this property, I don't think there is anything better on the  whole island. This area of Ka'anapali beach provides a very wide stretch of soft sand beach  so that you never feel crowded. From here, you have a perfect view of black rock where in  less than a two minute walk you can do some amazing snorkeling. This is also a great  beach for swimming, mostly calm in the mornings with a few waves picking up in the  afternoon, adding a little excitement to the beach.  On the other side of The Whaler is Whalers Village, a perfect compliment to this resort and the Ka'anapali beach area with it's beautiful variety of shops and restaurants (I highly recommend dinner at Leilani's and frozen yogurt from Yogurt Land any time of the day or night). Another plus to this property is that it fronts the beautiful Ka'anapali Beach Walk, perfect for a relaxing walk of jog any time of the day. All of our guests had the highest of compliments for this property and many had made plans to return before they even left! I have been all over the island of Maui and viewed many different resorts and although there are many other beautiful properties, The Whaler is where we will always return as it hosts the best combination of amenities that one could ask for to have a truly memorable Maui vacation experience!",Sep 2011,April 2011,Traveled with family,,"Sydney, Canada"
117725271,50,Unit 315 was fabulous! Had the best time!,"We just returned from our stay in unit 315 and had the most amazing stay. I would 100% recommend this unit to anyone!    Unit 315 is an ocean-view studio with a king size bed.    The unit is SUPER tidy and comes equipped with anything you might need ranging from dishes to pots and pans to a tea kettle to a coffee pot, flat screen tele, radio, DVD player, etc.    The unit is decorated island-style, so you definitely feel like you're on Maui when staying there.    As a whole, The Whaler was fabulous. It's in the heart of Ka'anapali Beach - in between the Westin/Whaler's Village and the Sheraton. There is pool/jacuzzi for your use, if the beach isn't your thing.    The activities desk (run by Beach Activities of Maui) was also very helpful.

We stayed in Tower One, in a gorgeously decorated studio with a marble bathroom, lovely little kitchen and a balcony with an ocean view. The beach is right at your feet, and the pool is lovely. Of course this is a condo, so no restaurants/bars/etc but you can stock up the fridge yourselves and do some laundry for a few quarters. The one BIG thing to be aware of is that there is a capital improvement project going on involving very loud jackhammers at 8:00 am. Allegedly the customers are forewarned about this, but our travel agent/the hotel most certainly did not inform us about it- but of course on Sat/Sun it is quiet. Other than the construction, my husband and I loved our stay T The Whaler, and having a whole little village and the beach steps away.",Aug 2011,August 2011,,,

116232539,40,Nice Combination of Home and Getaway,"My husband and I booked a studio unit at the Whaler through homeaway.com. We wanted to stay in the Ka'anapali area (this was a honeymoon re-do for us), but couldn't afford the more expensive hotels. This seemed like a perfect option for us - the unit had a kitchen, so we were able to eat breakfast in the room, and the price was right for the area.    When we pulled up, we noticed that the scale of this resort was much smaller that that of the others along the beach. It was a neat little property - nicely kept, with beautiful flowers. The lobby was very small, and the concierge desk was empty as often as it was occupied. The car park was self-serve. We were able to find parking every day but one, and then on that day they directed use to another lot onsite, though further away. The pool was small, and there were no where near enough chairs to lounge on. However, the beach right in front of the hotel was perfect for sunbathing and swimming. The hotel was a very short walk to Black Rock, which was great for snorkeling, and which had a nightly show in which a man blows a conch and then jumps off the cliff. The hotel is also RIGHT NEXT to Whaler's Village, which had lots of restaurants and shopping.    The room was beautiful. The bed was comfortable and large. The balconies all have at least a partial ocean view, and we enjoyed eating our breakfast on the lanai every morning. Our balcony did face another hotel, which was a little awkward at times, but nothing the curtains couldn't fix. The kitchen was perfect for what we were looking for - we were able to cook every morning, and even one night.    We would definitely stay here again. The location and the comfort factor made up for the few areas they were lacking.",Aug 2011,November 2010,Traveled as a couple,There is a map of the property on the website - choose carefully for ocean views.,"Los Angeles, California"
116227258,40,Excellent location - we will come back when construction is over,"We were in Tower I room 219. Our one bedroom condo was perfect for our family of four. There was a separate bedroom with king bed, a twin bed in a small area that is in sort of an alcove/ dressing area and a queen bed in living room. Each bed area has it's own TV. Doors to bedroom and alcove create privacy. There was also a portable bed in the closet.  The room was spacious and clean. kitchen was well stocked with whatever we needed to  cook meals. Additionally, there were beach chairs and a cooler for our use.    At first I was disappointed that we were not up higher, until I went out onto lani and realized that the palm trees out front made the balcony very private. We could see and enjoy the ocean but did not feel on display for others.    The buildings are under construction and while we were here tower One having a lot of work done. The drilling, scraping and jackhammers started at 8:00 am ever morning and went until 5 pm. The buildings are made of concrete so when they drill it reverberates through the entire building. If they are working near your unit and you are inside you will hear it and it gets old quickly! On day three we went and bought earplugs we could use if we wanted to sleep in or be inside and read- that helped ( construction was right on the floor above us) If you are on the go, or spend most of the day gone you may not be bothered by construction.    Whalers Village next door is convienent for shopping and dining ( Hula Grill is very good). Safeway is also close by 5 minute drive and next to Safeway you will find LuLu's which has amazing eggs Benedict with crab cakes- so good!

115876212,50,"Perfect location, breathtaking views","The Whaler property is on one of the most beautiful beaches in Hawaii. I rent from VRBO and rent directly from the owner. This gives you the opportunity to see pictures of the actual unit that you will be getting. I have rented the same unit for the past three years. It is like a home away from home. The Whaler is right next to Whalers Village which has shops and restaurants , our favorite is Leilani's for an amazing dinner with sunset views. The Whaler is undergoing a renovation project on the outside lanais that is not bothersome at all. If you spend the day on the beach or traveling around Maui, you will hardly notice. The best thing is that most of the owners have dropped their rental prices for the ""inconvenience"".

115868783,40,Renovations didn't bother us,"We had a great stay at the Whaler. At first we were assigned a studio unit in tower 2, overlooking the roof lines of the shops at Whaler's Village, with a scant view of the ocean from the lani, even though it was considered an ocean view. The unit was beautifully decorated - we just didn't like the location. Leilani at the front desk was very helpful - she let us check out another studio unit, overlooking the central courtyard and swimming pool, and it had an expansive view of the ocean from the lani. Although this unit was a little more dated, and came with a murphy bed, we preferred it over the updated unit - for us, the view was more important than the decor. Renovations in tower 1 began every morning at 8 a.m. - the noise was noticeable, but it didn't bother us - we were out and about most of the day and the construction work ceased by 5 p.m. One advantage of the construction work - with so many unoccupied units at the moment, parking in the garage was a breeze - lots of available parking spaces! In summary, if you don't mind a little noise and random room decor and still be on a beautiful beach in Maui - the Whaler works. If you're looking for a quiet getaway in a beautifully appointed room with lots of personal attention, look elsewhere.",Jul 2011,July 2011,Traveled as a couple,"Best views are from rooms facing the courtyard,","San Ramon, California"
115735041,50,Best vacation ever!,"We just got back from our honeymoon and stayed in a studio on the first floor. The studio was recently upgraded and it was very nice. The studio itself was much more spacious when compared to other nearby hotels. There was a separate bathroom and fully equipped kitchen. If we were going back to maui anytime soon, I would definitely stay here again. The staff was very friendly and went out of their way to help us. Being on the first floor meant no elevators or anything to get outside. There was construction going on and a few times it got loud while sitting at the pool. But overall, the construction really didn't bother us. The beach is steps from the hotel, making it very convenient and the famous black rock beach was a five minute walk. Black rock has amazing snorkeling with lots of tropical fish and giant hawaiian honu sea turtles. Whaler's village is just next door. We ate at Leilani's several times and Hula Grill once. Leilani's has a great taco special on Tuesday's. The town of Lahaina(shops, restaurants, etc.) is about a ten minute drive from the Whaler. There are tennis courts on site as well as a fitness center with lots of equipment. There is also a nice hottub right next to the pool.

115619815,50,Great for a family of five! Easy!,"We stayed in room 657 and rented through VRBO (first time and easy). We usually stay in resort hotel rooms instead of condos, so this was a first for our family. We all know that Hawaii is very particular about five people in hotel resort room. When the kids were young, we could do it. But now that they are older we needed more space. That is what i like about this condo. There was a separate bedroom with a door, In the living area was a large sofa bed and a twin rollaway. The view was pretty of the ocean and you could see the ocean sitting on the couch in the living room and the patio.. The patio is very large with chairs. This is on the sixth floor. Not too high or low. Want to go to the beach? You walk out your room , walk a few steps to the elevator, walk out the door to the pool and beach. I would say convenience is very good. The owner has backpack beach chairs in the room. Easy. The Whaler beach hut is right as you walk out to the beach for umbrella renting. It can be windy so we had a professional put the umbrella in. Tip: Afternoon only umbrella was $10.00. We spent every afternoon on the beach after our Maui activities. Basically, if you don't want to walk far to get beached, this is the hotel for you. Great beach in front of the hotel. Sandy, but beware of the 6th or 7th wave set. Small and then kapow!! You could spend all day just being entertained on the beach . Very exciting and as long as you know the risks in the ocean- very fun. Teenagers loved it. You can walk to black rock to snorkel. But the best snorkel was in north west maui at the Honolou Bay?? It is where some boats take people but you can drive there, and walk through a jungle road, and snorkel away. Great fish. Probably only good in the summer. Winter may be too harsh. Liked the Hula Grill next door, the Whaler shopping next door, Starbucks at the Westin a little walk down the boardwalk, coffee at the Kaanapali beach hotel next door (small shop in front of lobby), magic show at Kaanapali (expensive and old fashion magic), always the Napili Shores breakfast-Gazebo, Longhi breakfast in Lahaina, boardgames in the condo were a hit.

115099931,30,Great bang for your buck but stay away from the hotel's concierge lady!!!!,"I was very nervous after reading the reviews on this place. I was afraid I was going to get stuck with one of the horrible rooms some people did. However, when we walked into our studio we were very surprised! Our room was nicely upgraded. The only downside was a mold/mildew smell. The beautiful grounds are kept up. The pool and spa are nice. Yes, there is some major construction going on but we weren't bothered by it. Whenever they were doing the construction we weren't in our room anyway. One thing though...if you got a ocean front room you might want to reconsider getting just an ocean view room because there are scaffolds blocking your view.    Now for the bad parts...the woman working the concierge is VERY rude!!! No aloha spirit there! My husband went down to the front desk to see if he could get a voucher/receipt printed for a parasailing reservation we made online (you get a discount if you reserve online). However, it would have been $7 (or something crazy) for them to print it. So, the lady at the front desk said that the concierge could help him. My husband explained to her how he wanted to get the online discount and she said she could help him. She called the parasailing place and began making reservations for him. However, when he was told the total he said that it was the same price as just calling and making the reservations...not with the discount. She then very rudely said to the parasailing person, ""Nevermind! He's going to do it himself!"" then HUNG UP on them and then RIPPED UP the peice of paper that she had written down his information on right IN FRONT of him!!!! How incredibly RUDE!!! My husband walked away and then went to the lady at the front desk and told her they need to get a new concierge but the front desk lady seemed to be ""whatever"" about it. The $12 per day parking, the concierge lady, and the lack of caring by the front desk lady in the situation is what is making us consider not staying here the next time we are in Maui.    P.S.

114988322,20,disappointed,We booked this hotel unaware that they were under construction.  Our travel agent received an e-mail shortly before we left. I wanted to change hotels but our agent was assured that they would accomodate us. Several calls were made by her including on the day we were arriving(this was our 30th wedding anniversary trip).  The work was being done in Tower 1 including the area near the pool. On check in we were told we were in tower 1 and I questioned the woman. She assured us that we weren't near the construction area. We walked through scaffolding to get into the tower and when we entered our room and walked out on to the patio we overlooked the construction staging area to the right and scaffolding to the the left-ugh.  So as not to ruin this beautiful trip I said nothing to my husband as he doesn't like any form of complaining when these things happen. Why should we have had to fight for decent accomodations anyway.  This hotel is in a great location but has zero amenities.

I decided to be a little proactive and contacted the Condo directly, made a couple of requests (updated condo; away from the construction; unobstructed view of Black Rock) and the Whaler came through!!!    1. LOCATION. The Whaler is located in the heart of Kaanapali. It is conveniently located within walking distance to many restaurants, shopping and other hotels & resorts. After a long day of seeing the island, it was so nice to have the option to go out to dinner without having to drive somewhere. Want to snorkel at Black Rock? Five minute walk.  2. BEACH. Their beach is on one of the widest parts of the BEAUTIFUL Kaanapali Beach. You have numerous beachside activities right at your fingertips!  3. POOL. Much bigger (and nicer) than photos indicate. We never had problems finding chairs to sit in. There is also a hot tub there.  3. PROPERTY. The grounds are manicured beautifully with plenty of outdoor seating! There are also grills onsite for your use.  4. OUR UNIT (1160). Since the condo's are owned individually, it can be a gamble on getting what you want. Our unit in particular was FABULOUS! We had the most WONDERFUL view; our kitchen and both baths have been recently renovated with new tile, granite countertops & newer carpet. Absolutely no complaints here!  5. THE CONSTRUCTION. To us, this was moot. Maybe it's because we stayed in the building that WASN'T being worked on, but I really did not notice it at all. Yes we heard it; no it was not going to ruin our trip.

I will not name their names although I did get them from other staffers, one in particualar seemed drunk all the time and he was always yelling at someone, while another female didnt like where we were walking and was very rude in asking if we were staying there and was quick to yell at our son about talking in the hallway in the evening, he is two. She was rude to my husband and myself and was letting us know that if we were to come back to Maui to not bother coming there again, she didnt want to see us.

The hotel is a bit outdated but well worth the comfort and value. Maid service was daily. The pool was clean and large. Coffee was served poolside every morning. Next door is Whaler's Village which included several shops, restaurants and an ABC store for food and necessities. It's a bit pricey, however.The sunset faces the beach directly in front of the hotel, and what a gorgeous sight it was. The beach is spotless.

First, we arrived early in Maui, but were not allowed to check-in until after 4:00...even though the unit was probably ready. Secondly, there were renovations occurring on the lanais above us (tower 1). Not a huge problem since we weren't in the room much during the day. Other than that, everything was wonderful. The unit was nicely renovated and had a great view...and it was next to the laundry room.

It's also about a 5-10 minute drive to Lahaina where you've got many more options.  Beach: The Whaler does have an activities booth that provides towels to guests and rents out snorkel gear for $15. Black Rock, located at the end of the beach, is a nice place to snorkel. I heard that Honolua Bay is also a nice snorkel spot, but it's about a 10-15 drive north.

102481527,50,Wonderful,We spent a month Mar 1-March 31 at The Whaler and had a fabulous time. We rented through VRBO and everything was exactly as promised. The front desk checked us in and out and supplied the keys and towel cards etc. The staff are very friendly. The grounds are lovely. The Whaler is in the perfect location. Next to the Whalers Village and close to black rock for snorkelling. We enjoyed Maui and can't wait to go back and would not hesitate to stay at The Whaler again. We rented a car and loved touring Maui to see the sites.,Apr 2011,March 2011,Traveled as a couple,,"Newmarket, Canada"
101624887,50,Absolutely Wonderful!,"Everything was great! The rooms had been newly renovated and were beautiful, there was everything you needed in the kitchen to make any meal, and bbq's outside for the guests to use. We had to wait sometimes but that just gave us time to visit with other guests/owners. (If you're in a hurry...don't go to Maui, that is not the way it works there!) We had a ground level room and although the view from the higher levels was beautiful, the garden area that we looked out at was beautiful as well. The staff was very friendly and always had the room clean. There was some construction going on while we were staying there, and even that didn't make it any less enjoyable! We would recommend this place to anyone! If you want to be doing some or your own cooking and save some money on eating out, it is ideal!",Mar 2011,March 2011,Traveled as a couple,,"Grande Prairie, Canada"
101012181,40,Exceeded my expectations!!!,"The whaler is an older hotel but with the renovations it is going to fabulous once completed, it is wonderful now.  The lobby is small and comfortable - the staff is very friendly maid service is fantastic.  You have all the convenience of a condo with the added bonus of haviing maid service each day. Yes each condo is individual for what you will get but we have not spoke with anyone so far who is disappointed. It is an older crowd mostly at this resort as the pool is not exactly small children friendly - but we did see some older children here but not many.  The views are spectacular from here. Black Rock is close for the evening sunset dive. The whaler`s village is next door our room was right across from the hula grill, I was worried that the noise would be annoying - however it was never an issue the sound of all the birds singing totally dominant any sound from the whaler`s village. As well on this side of the building you get fabulous sunshine on your huge lanai. I would say that the best views are probably 5th floor and up. The tradewinds have been strong in march its spring I guess. the evenings can be cooler than expected as well. We stayed in a studio suite and it was more than comfortable for 2 people, I had thought of getting a 1bdrm 2bath but this was more than adequate. its a quiet lovely place to stay.We went to use the front desk advisor to book a rental car. We were told that they didn`t have anything immediately and the price was over priced when they said they could get us something later in the day. We decided to go to our room and search online, we sent an online reservation request within minutes our reservation was accepted and they were at our hotel in 10 minutes to pick us up to pick up our rental car, we got a great deal and a decent car a G6, so my advice get your own rental. cheaper and faster.",Mar 2011,March 2011,Traveled as a couple,,"Saskatoon, Canada"

98798667,40,Great hotel and wonderful time.,"We are a couple in our mid sixties who have traveled a lot. Our expectations have increased along with our ages, and The Whaler met our expectations. It is not a flashy resort with a lot of bling but it is fast (as in service, check-in/out, ease), fun and friendly. The resort is extremely clean and the grounds are beautiful. Everything is well maintained (some of the exterior needs cleaning/painting which was just getting started) and the employees are extremely friendly and helpful.  We were assigned a 3rd floor unit on the north side of the north tower. This is probably among the worst locations as the balcony faces the hotel to the north and much of the grounds between units is being used for the construction equipment and materials for the exterior renovation...and the higher floors obviously have better views. Nonetheless, our spacious balcony still afforded a nice ocean view and we loved sitting out in the morning and evening. Our very spacious unit (318- a studio w/kitchenette and 1 bath) has been completely redone and was magnificent: ceramic tile, granite countertops, stainless appliances, inlaid bamboo ceiling, great ceiling lighting fixtures, beautiful modern furnishings, large flat screen TV on wall swivel, beautiful artwork and excellent attention to detail, large walk-in closet with safe, built-in wooden cabinetry for storage, free wireless internet...the list goes on.  Apparently some units have not been updated (or maybe to not such a high standard) so it might be worth asking when checking in.  This might have been the quietest hotel we have ever been in. Though it was completely filled, once our door was shut there were no noises from anything...real nice. The fitness room (convenient...also in the north tower) is well equipped and mostly empty when I used it. The pool isn't real splashy (except for some of the little kids frolicking)...a standard rectangle, but was fine...as was the accompanying hot tub. Some might not like lack of a bar/grill/snack shop at the pool but that was not an issue for us. And, the Kaanapali beach walk (it goes from one end of the beach to the other...great for walking/jogging/running) goes right by the pool (great people watching) and is just a few steps either direction for food/snacks/libations.  What the Whaler lacks...pool slides, waterfalls, ""caves and grottos"", expensive landscape sculptures...ie, Las Vegas glitz...it makes up for in its simplicity and for us made it a great stay.  The only real minus wasn't real bad...and seems to be a chronic Maui problem: parking. It's $12 a day at the Whaler and the underground garage and surface lot seem to be perpetually overflowing. One night there were no spaces and so the lot attendant gave us a pass to park in the Whaler Shopping Center lot which is immediately adjacent and worked fine.  As The Whaler was a little lower in price than the adjacent resorts (we booked an Orbitz package) we were a little concerned that it might be run down or somehow not okay. We are glad we took a chance as we were very satisfied.",Mar 2011,February 2011,Traveled as a couple,,"Omaha, Nebraska"
98689994,50,Absolutely perfect!,"Booked the Whaler through travelocity for a stay February 10th thru February 17th. After reading reviews I was a bit nervous as it seemed the experience depended a lot on which unit number you ended up with. All those concerns went right out the window once we checked in. We had a studio facing whalers village on the 6th floor of tower 2. Some people complained of noises ect. coming from the whalers village area. We found it to be a complete non issue. We were supposed to have garden view, it was actually an ocean view. Bonus! Our room had been updated and was far more than adequate, it was nice. There cannot be enough good said about the location of the whaler, absolutely perfect. One of the best beaches I've been to and I've been to quite a few beaches. With whalers village right next door it is walking distance to anything you could want. The town of Lahaina was only a 5 minute drive. Location, Location, Location!! The staff was all very helpful, the grounds were nice and well kept.

97515606,50,A comfortable place to discover the island of Maui,"We stayed at The Whaler for 3 nights in room 615, we had a great view of the ocean and at night you could hear the waves from the room which was a nice way to wake up each morning. A rental car is a must as the journey from the airport Kahului OGG is just over 45 minutes when you have a good run. The walkway up and down Kaanapali beach was a great way to get some exercise to burn off all the calories gained by eating some great food. Staff at The Whaler were very friendly and everything is easy to find and navigation was easy enough and straight forward. If you have the time take the road to Hana, very windy but well worth the few hours each way.  Our room also had free Wi-Fi which made keeping in touch with the world easy. Lots of space and very comfortable.",Feb 2011,February 2011,,,"Mount Coolum, Australia"
96737919,50,best location in maui,"This was our 8th stay at the whaler, so there is a reason why we keep coming back. Have to be careful on which room you book, because some rooms are outdated. Some owners are more up to date then others. Now that our kids are grown, we book a studio unit overlooking the courtyard and ocean. New landscaping is nice and the view of the whales in the winter can't be beat. Complete renovation will be complete by the end of this year, so be aware that there might be some minor construction going on. New planters, new lanai and railings, and a new paint job are being done this year. So please check before hand if there will be a problem with the unit that you will be renting. Condo renting is the best, if you don't feel like going out, you have the option of staying in a cooking your own meal. Outdoor grills are provided onsite. Nice golf course just across the street, if you are a golfer. The Skins game has been played there for the past few years. Nice not to difficult course. After a day of golf, hiking, surfing or just relaxing, head over to the whalers village and get a yogurt. This stuff is the best, little bit of sugar, but who cares, you are on vacation. Burn it off with your next hike. A couple of nice eateries near by. The sidewalk fronting the beach is a nice walk in early morning or late afternoon. Nice people watching adventure, and you can get a nice mile or two walk. Have fun.",Feb 2011,January 2011,Traveled as a couple,,"Chicago, Illinois"

We like being next to the Whaler Village shopping center for restaurants, happy hours and even picking up a few things at the ABC store. Some days we never drove our car at all, just a couple trips to Lahaina and Wailea. The condo was furnished attractively and the kitchen had everything we needed to eat most of our breakfasts, lunches and snacks. The balcony had a fantastic view. The staff was very nice to us also.

We were in Room 160. It was clean but it is very dated.  The unit really, really needs a renovation. (only the tv was nice.)  The King Sized bed was hard as a rock.  There were items like dressers and such just stacked in the hallway inside the unit. Yuck!  The diswasher was out of order.  The ice machine in the fridge didn't work and wo when we called the front desk for ice they --very begrudgingly--brought us ice.  The coffee pot was missing.  Generally...Yucky.  The location is very nice as it has great surf and you're right on the ocean. Maybe other units are better.  Maybe because we were put up they used this awful unit...but here we are and I would not recommend this hotel on what we saw..????  the people watching is great at the Whaler.  There are restaurants (including fast food) within walking distance and also lots of the fancy hoity toity stores if you like that sorta stuff.  I hope that if you're going to this place that you don't get put in this unit.

93978622,50,401 has Awesome Oceanfront Views and Lots of Sun,"The southwest facing oceanfront condos at the Whaler are incredible. They have huge L-shaped balconies that give a wide angle upfront view of the ocean and even a view east to West Maui mountain. I did not see any other Kaanapali accomodations with such an excellent view. All rooms on the south side of tower 1 and 2 get all day sun. Rooms on the north side get no sun at all. Oceanfront rooms are more expensive but totally worth it. Great whale watching from the balcony. Palm trees in front of the oceanfront units give much needed afternoon shade only if you are on the first 6 floors. Higher floors have wide open views but no shade at all. The desirable southwest facing oceanfront rooms end in numbers 01,03, 51 or 53. Northwest facing oceanfront rooms get only afternoon sun. The pool is new and nice but simple. It is kept at a very comfortable 85 degrees unlike the cold but beautiful pools at the Westin,Hyatt and Sheraton. Excellent nextdoor access to Restaurants and stores at Whaler village.

92336265,40,Just perfect - whaler unit 863,"Stayed 7 nights on mix of business and leisure. This is not a hotel, but a condo complex, two buildings on beach. Stayed in studio unit 863 rented through vrbo. The location is terrific, on the beach in area of various nice resorts, walking path, not too commercial, walking distance to snorkel black rock, gorgeous ocean, lanai and sunset views to the west, mountains to the east. The Whaler is a bit older, but going through various updating efforts with a location that cannot be beat. A $12 per night parking charge by the whaler property management was pretty irritating. Whaler village next door is convenient - we loved the Hula Grill for food, ambience and mellow live music; and not too noisy for units on the south side of south building as I initially feared. The unit 863 we rented had been totally renovated and was fantastic for a couple, more than enough space, high end amenities and decor, comfortable bed. Unit  owner was great to work with.

89942541,30,"Great, but not entirely what I expected","This is a great place to stay if you want to be close to things....the beach, stores, restaurants......The down side , well there are a couple of things....... the staff are not the best, I dont know if its bad training or they are underpaid but the reception staff were very very s.l.o.w. We nearly missed our flight due to a mess up with checking out which was entirely their fault and they didnt even apologize! Also, the cleaners werent the best...it was really hit and miss as to whether they would replace things once they ran out.....tea, coffee, toilet paper, soaps etc. There is also something to be aware of....there is alot of construction going on at that place. It may be something to do with how old the building is, but if you are looking to have some peace and quiet you are not gonna find it here. We were told that the planter boxes are being replaced while we were there and we checked to find out how much noise there would be, we were told that it wouldnt disrupt us atall - Ha! turns out they underplayed it...thankfully we were ok with all the noise but there was alot going on.....drilling, sawing, heavy equipment (which seemed to be constantly reversing with the beep beep beeping) They start pretty early too, so not that great if you wish to sleep in. We had a baby waking us up before they started so for us it was ok, but I could see that being an annoyance.  On the plus side there are great view, the room we stayed in (670) was really modern and clean. The view was pretty good. Could see the ocean and beach really well, if you sat inside the rooms though you could really only see across to the other tower.....at people looking across at you.........  Despite all the negative things I have put, I would recommend it if you like to have easy access to stuff.....swimming, shopping, eating, beach walks, sunsets, the room was spacious too.

This is a fabulous condo and so very beautiful and well maintained. It had everything we could have wanted. The full kitchen with granite counter tops with gourmet touches was great. There was a big screen in the living room and bedroom, which I am sure were professionally decorated.  It also had a great Bose player where we could plug in our IPod and listen to music when we were not listening to the waves lapping the beach, which is a few steps away. The pool is also oceanside with lots of lounge chair available, some with covers. The living room, dining room, and two patios were very comfortable, large enough to entertain our many new friends. Don't know which was the best, the location or the heavenly, extremely comfortable bed. It was glorious!!! Obviously, Unit 112 at The Whaler will be the only place we will be staying on Maui.

88463088,40,The Whaler Studio #418,"My hubby and I booked the studio condo at the Whaler through Pleasant Holiday. As soon as we open the door, this studio size was good enough for two of us. There was a kitchen (upgraded), walk-in closet with safe, full bathroom, king size bed and pull out couch bed as well. The balcony was facing at the construction tennis court and next door property; however, it did not bother us too much since we were mostly outside for activity or at the beach for snorkel. The only thing that was missing in the room was the iron table.... but that was ok since we only used the iron once during our 5 night stay at the Whaler.    The staffs were all kind and helpful. We did not use the pool cuz it was always crowded... plus we had rented snorkel gear so we were mostly at the beach. The kitchen had everything we needed so we went to Safeway which is around 6 min away from the property and bought things we needed during the stay.    This property is perfect cuz the water is not rough and close to Sheraton and Westin. plus the Whaler village for shopping and free hula show. (it was very cute)    The parking is $12/day at the Whaler and there is a towel service outside (but u must bring back the towel otherwise you will be charged for $25 per)    We miss Maui (Lahaina) and we would like to go back to the Whaler when opportunity comes in future because we find that this location is close to everything - Old Lahaina Luau, Safeway, the beach etc.    FYI: there is the construction on this property at this time pls another construction at the whaler's village parking lot.

After seeing the room, however, we felt we needed to look elsewhere and were referred to the Whaler.    Annette Guerrara at the front desk greeted us, gathered the information on the problem of finding a room in Maui in a hurry without breaking the bank, and went to consult with other members of the hotel staff; these other staff members were Leilani Steward also of the front desk and Henry Quinsant, Reservations Manager. Between the three of these great people, we were set up in Unit 670 for very little additional money per night. The unit was beautiful, clean and had an awesome view.    During our stay Annette, Leilani, Amelia, and Rod at the front desk were very helpful and always genuinely friendly and enthusiastic. Fred Burgart the bellman was very helpful and courteous as well.    On the last day of our stay we had a late flight out at 10 pm. The staff came through again with a late checkout at 4 pm and our luggage was safely put away by Fred the bellman until we had to head to the airport... very helpful !!    We had a great time at the Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel prior to coming to the Whaler but we have to say the Whaler really made our 25th Anniversary trip complete and so very special.

86318278,10,Hell on Earth,"I went on my long awaited one week vacation to Maui hoping to get away from hectic Los Angeles life and challenging work. I booked my “ocean view” room at the Whaler by calling an Aston reservations representative. Based on previous reviews, it appeared that there may be construction projects scheduled for the Whaler. During the booking process, I was reassured by the agent that all construction projects at the Whaler have been completed. Upon my arrival to the Whaler on October 29, 2010, I was immediately greeted with horrible construction noise. At check in, I was given a room in tower one, where most of the construction was going on. The construction noise was unbearable and I kindly asked for a different room. I was then given a room in tower two.    I mentioned the construction noise to, Annette, the front desk representative. I also informed Annette that I was advised by Aston staff at the time of booking that there was no planned construction for the Whaler. Annette explained that the construction noise during renovations two years ago was much worse as compared to the noise now, which was no solace to me.    The room in tower two was dirty and the furniture was dated. The noise from the construction in tower one was still very bothersome. During my first night at the Whaler, I noticed that the toilet was leaking. I advised the front desk staff of the plumbing problem, however, the maintenance man wanted to see an actual puddle before fixing the leak. It took five days for maintenance to fix the toilet leak.    Not once was my room properly cleaned during my stay at the Whaler. My room was plagued with an increasing amount of dust. Housekeeping staff also neglected to change the original tattered blood stained bed sheets.    On day five of my trip, I woke up in the morning to find a lizard crawling on the ceiling of my room situated on the twelfth floor of the structure. I called the front desk and security was kind enough to remove the lizard from my room. The Whaler staff found a lizard crawling in my room to be very amusing. At $200 per night, I do not wish to be sharing my accommodations with reptiles. I am from LA and I do not even do camping.    While walking down the stairs at the Whaler, I noticed numerous dead cockroaches the size of rats and a chemical smell. Based on the previous review of the Whaler, it appears they were fumigating the property for pests at the time of my visit. None of this information was disclosed by Whaler staff. I do not wish to be exposed to chemicals and other carcinogens during my vacation. If I had known about the fumigation, I would have left the Whaler immediately.    The staff at the Whaler expressed no remorse for the condition of their property, the construction noise the reptile infested room or for completely ruining my vacation. Annette appeared especially condescending and unprofessional. My long awaited one week of relaxation on Maui turned out to be a nightmare, due to the Whaler.    The Whaler is situated on a nice stretch of Kaanapali Beach and has nice potential. However, due to current property conditions, construction noise, poor customer service and deceptive practices, I strongly caution other vacationers from staying at the Whaler on Kaanapali Beach!!!",Nov 2010,November 2010,Traveled solo,,"Los Angeles, California"
86110937,30,Quick trip at an interesting hotel situation,"My Mom and I booked a quick weekend trip out to Maui for some wedding planning. We stayed at the Whaler. We got in late (no valet parking) and no parking at the lots for guests (we had to park in the employee lot which wasn't too far but still). The front desk receptionist was nice and friendly.    When we got to our room with outdated furnishings we realized that the bed was a fold out in the wall. For the two of us we had a couch and a full sized out of wall bed. This was not acceptable as we requested a room with two double beds (booked through a 3rd party website-Orbitz or Expedia). Our room was switched to a first floor that had a king sized bed so at least this was better.    We thought we were staying at a hotel but the Whaler is actually a condo/timeshare/hotel property. In any case, when we were there all the rooms were getting fumigated for pests (no option on this). The pool was a pool you'd find in a run down apartment complex but that didn't stop people from using it. When we called the front desk b/c the coffee machine wasn't working they told us that our unit wasn't ran by them....it was so odd.    The Pros: Delicious pineapple in our room when we arrived. Beach in front of the Whaler is beautiful. We did get a really cheap rate. Right next to a shopping center and all the other main hotels.

85647438,40,Best place to kick back and relax,"We have been staying at the Whaler at least once a year since 1995 and can't think of a better place to relax. The condos are large and comfortable and the location is just awesome, with views of both Molokai and Lanai. Although they don't have a grand (over the top) pool like other resorts along Kaanapali Beach, the ocean is the main attraction and the Whaler is in just about the best location of all. It is an easy walk next door to Whaler's Village for shopping and restaurants, and snorkeling at Black Rock is also an easy walk up the beach. We typically rent from a realtor or directly from owners to make it much more affordable and it is much cheaper than the resort hotels in the area. You don't get daily maid service but they always leave plenty of towels and soap, so the daily intrusion isn't missed. We just love the laid back feel at the Whaler and always feel that we've come home when we get there! One caution - they are removing the concrete planter boxes through November 2010, so if you're going over this time, ask if your unit will be one of those affected.",Nov 2010,October 2010,Traveled as a couple,,"Scottsdale, Arizona"

There were only a couple of disappointments we had during our stay. One was that the resort charges for the lounge chairs that are used on the beach. Another was to have to pay for parking.

We chose the one with the view, The studio kitchen did not have many dishes and pots. We called the front desk and within a hour, somebody came with the utensils. The unit was very clean and rennovated. The hotel is next to Whaler's village with lots of shops and restaurants. I will not suggest to shop there as it is very expensive. Drive 3 miles to Lahania for much better prices. The only negative was 12 dollars per day and was expensive. We really loved our stay there and will definately stay there again..",Oct 2010,September 2010,Traveled as a couple,,"Dallas, Texas"
83179654,50,The Whaler 765-Perfect Unit in an almost perfect location,"This unit is by far the most elegant place we have ever stayed. The totally renovated studio condo did not disappoint in any way--until you opened the patio door. Unfortunately, the expansive ocean view is marred by the noise of the ventilation system and smoke smells from the restaurants below the units--going almost all day and night. This was our 3rd Whaler stay, and the first one on the Whaler's Village side of Tower 2. When you have an option, the better side would be the one facing Black Rock, but the price of this unit and it's amenities helped make up for the inconvenience of the noise and cooking odors below. The overall location of The Whaler can't be beat-- with easy walking to many restaurants and shopping nearby, snorkeling, a good beach, and a warm pool. It will always be our favorite place on Maui!",Oct 2010,February 2010,Traveled as a couple,,Oregon
83059613,40,The Whaler is Beautiful,"This was our first time staying at the Whaler, and we all agreed it was one of the nicest places we have stayed in Maui. We loved our 2 bedroom 2 bath corner unit on the 9th floor. We had breathtaking views of the ocean and we could listen to the surf 24/7.  The front desk was extremely accomodating as were the beach attendants. Another great thing about the Whaler is the central location to Whalers Village and to other great snorkeling beaches nearby.  We will definitely stay at the Whaler again!",Oct 2010,September 2010,Traveled as a couple,,California
82741966,50,Great location and price make this an awesome value,"My husband and I booked a last minute getaway to Maui for our 50th birthdays when we found an unexpectedly low airfare. We usually stay at the KBH, but in shopping prices we found the ""Hawaii 5-0"" rate at the Whaler (this is available if at least one in your party is 50 or above). We stayed in a studio on the 8th floor of tower 1 facing Black Rock. It was amazing!!!! The view was called partial ocean, but we had a great view of the ocean as well as the Mountains with the awesome rainbows. The room was clean, comfortable and well decorated. There was a fresh pineapple, cut for easy eating delivered by housekeeping shortly after we checked in. With our rate we also got a gift bag filled with various local treats and two Whaler coffee mugs. We were high enough to have a great view of the evening cliff divers on Black Rock, and we could enjoy relaxing on our balcony without feeling like we were staring into the neighboring property windows. The Whaler is right on the beach so you have easy accesss to all of the great dining opportunities Kaanapili has to offer (ie: Barefoot Grill for great fish tacos and a Lava Flow, or Leilani's for amazing Hula Pie!), but the fully equipped kitchen allows for budget saving eating in.

79569072,40,Great Home Base for Maui Trip,"I have to remind myself that this is not a review for Maui, but rather a review for the Whaler. :) Maui is obviously amazing and would score off the charts if I could give the island a review. The Whaler proved to be a wonderful home base for my husband and I, as we explored the island of Maui. The service staff we encountered was always very friendly, the grounds were immaculate, and the pool was well tended. While the pool is small, my husband and I enjoyed the fact that it is literally right on the beach. We felt like our personal items were nice and safe in the enclosed area of the pool while we went in the ocean or down the path to lunch.    We stayed in 1170, which had an ocean view as well as a great view of the mountains. I thoroughly enjoyed the over-sized porch we had. After each daily adventure, it was nice to sit on the porch, watching the daylight hours wind down on one side and almost always a rainbow shining through the clouds on the other. Our room was a 1 bed, 2 bath condo. We rented directly from the owner as he is a family friend. The rooms were spacious, had all the supplies we needed, and very immaculate. I will say that the bathrooms and kitchen were a bit dated, but that did not affect the functionality in any way. Honestly, we spent most of our time outdoors, enjoying the island, so a little datedness did not bother us. We also appreciated the in-unit washer and dryer. I'm not sure if this is a feature all the units have.    We also felt that the Whaler provided a nice central location, not only on Kaanapali, but for everything else in Maui as well. We spent many nights in Lahaina or Kapalua, both of which are just a short drive down the highway. Getting to the airport and the Pa'ia area only took us 35 minutes.    Overall, Kaanapali beach is a great place to stay while in Maui and the Whaler is a great deal for such a prime location.",Sep 2010,September 2010,Traveled as a couple,,"Chicago, Illinois"
79392726,40,Very Nice comfortable relaxing place next to a beautiful beach!,"Stayed at The Whaler 9-3 through 9-10. We had an absolutely fabulous time. We were on the 9th floor (915), and we had an excellent oceanview room, not to be mistaken with ocean front, but you were in Maui so it was still really really nice!.. Had a great time at the hot tub and pool area. This condo is situated really close to the beach so you can do both. Great Sunsets, go to Hula grill for 3-5pm happy hour, mai tais were excellent and they have music. We snorkeled at the local Sherton black rock which was within walking distance. Loved Maui, Would definitely book at The Whaler again! oh please note that upon our departure we were told they were going to start renovating the condos, so call them up to see when they are finished. I'm told they will be starting heavy construction on all the planter areas soon! The other downside was they charged $12.00 a day for parking but I guess all Hawaii Hotels do the same.",Sep 2010,September 2010,Traveled with family,,Fremont
78550257,40,Excellent condo rentals are great value on Kaanapali Beach,"After searching for bargains in this expensive area we were pleased with our rental condo in The Whaler on Kaanapali Beach. The location was 5 Star, right on the main strip, between the Whaler Village shopping center and the Kaanapali Beach Hotel. Great views of Black Rock. We turned a large one BR into an adequate 2 BR by utilizing the owner's murphy bed & rollaway for our teenage sons. There are great grills and tables directly adjacent to the beach. Lot's of restaurants just a few steps away. Pool & spa at these twin buildings are a bit small but alright. (shhh, we tried the Hyatt's pool/spa once.) There was one other condo building called Kaanapali Alii which appears newer just 2 buildings away. We found the rentals on the VRBO website.

77038207,40,Have a great time at room 857,"We made an impulse trip to Maui and found a great deal at the Whaler. Checking in was a breeze and we were given a choice of three rooms (one of them an upgrade). We chose 857 and it was excellent and the room was huge. Nice view of the beach and renovated kitchen and bathrooms. I did notice a difference in the service with the checkin staff but the one who initially checked us in (Helen) was fabulous.  The hotel is on the beachfront and next door to Whalers village so overall the location is excellent.  A couple of tips  1. Make sure you see your room before checking in. There is a difference in quality of the individual rooms  2. Tower 2 is adjacent to the village and has some noise. It didnt bother us but it might bother if you're sensitive to noise.  3. There is a big variance in the ocean view condos. Some of them (like 857) have wonderful views, others not as much    If you're a little careful with the room choice then this place will work out just great",Aug 2010,August 2010,Traveled with family,,"Saratoga, California"
76885522,10,very disappointing,"I just returned from a week atThe Whaler on Kaanapali Beach on Maui and what a disappointment. Check- in was a nightmare, Rod, the clerk was rude, hostile, and refused to book us into the room we had held a reservation for for nearly 3 months . Rod insisted we could not have made the reservation , even though I had a confirmation number and we were listed in his computer as arriving that day. After much hasseling, Rod finally gave us a room after we agreed to an ""upgrade"". First he wanted $150. a night but when I fussed and flatly refused somehow he immediately dropped the price to $ 25. a night The room did have an ocean view, but was dirty, worn, frayed, and badly in need of an face lift..The toilet roon was was very dirty and had not been painted or updated in 15 years +++ The kitchen area had ants on the counter top every day. ""When we initially arrived in the room following the disasterous check in, there were no towels or linen in the room. I returned to the desk to ask that some be brought to us and Rod asked me if I had pulled the bed cover back to see if we had any sheets on our ''upgraded"" bed. I was shocked. Rod really gave our trip a negative starthe was just mean and hostile. but we made the most of it and Hawaii just can't be beat. The beaches are great. I would never tell anyone to go toThe Whaler unless they are ready to be gouged and ripped off which I think is clearly a way of business there.

It was through the comments on Tripadvisor that we decided to stay at the Whaler on Kaanapali Beach and we were not disappointed. Our unit was 413-a studio (unit 1) and it had every amenity that we needed. Our unit was very clean, and was perfect for the two of us. It had a very large bathroom with lots of storage room for your personal items. There was a large closet with bins for storing your clothes, a safe, hangers, iron board, iron. A small library of books had been started on the top shelf of the closet which was nice. The kitchen was well appointed with new appliances and there was every kind of cooking utencil, pots, pans, that you would need. The livingroom/bed area was very comfortable. We had a kingsize bed and a pull out sofa. Wide sliding doors opened up to the lani which had a table & chairs. Our unit had a side view of the beach and ocean which was perfect. You can sleep at night with just the screen doors to the lani closed and let the ocean breeze and the sound of the waves lull you to sleep! It was very quiet and we were never kept awake by noisy neighbours or out side noise. We have stayed in many hotels over the years and without exception this was the best by far.  The Whaler is close to shopping and restaurants. The Whaler also has an on sight activity representative who can assist you with any excursions. We used her service and was very satisfied by her recommendations. We found the hotel staff to be very pleasant and accommodating. We will recommend The Whaler to our friends without hesitation.

It had everything we needed and a fabulous view of the beach from the balcony. The grounds were well kept and the condo was cleaned daily. Gas grills are by the beach. We loved grilling while watching the sunset. Having a kitchen saved us much money and time as we scheduled so much into our vacation. The only negative is that the pool is small and has limited shady areas. However, we were always able to find available chairs.

73517344,50,Awesome...look no further..this is paridise,"The Whaler Unit #1118 is an awesome place to stay in Maui.  The property is right on the Kaanapali Beach. This is a nice beach. The Owner Bob is a pleasure to work with for all the arrangements. Bob knows a lot about Maui. The true value of the condo can only be experienced when you are actually there and see the view. Yes, an oceanfront unit would be grand and probably cost “a few grand” but this unit was second to none. The Whaler is in an excellent location and you can walk to snorkel down the beach 5 minutes at Black rock. If you get the courage you may even cliff dive Blackrock. It may not look high, but try it….and find out.  This studio unit is well equipped with everything a vacation couple needs to enjoy their vacation. The kitchen is stocked with every cooking utensil you can imagine. The appliances are brand new. It has blenders, toasters…everything. The bathroom is also well stocked. Plenty of towels and wash rags. We loved the glass doors on the shower but even better yet the soap(s) & conditioner dispensers in the shower. The water pressure is awesome. The unit has a recliner chair to sit back, relax and watch the huge TV screen. It has a DVD & VHS and a connection to the internet all included. The bed is very comfortable. Two more pillows would have been nice. The lanai is excellent. We had breakfast every morning while gazing out over the view. The added screen doors were great. It faces black rock side of the island and is wonderful because you get the early sun and afternoon shade after beach time. The unit also comes with coolers, beach chairs, umbrellas, straw hats, iron & board. It has a library of books. We were too busy to read. The breeze on the 11th floor is excellent and most times A/C was not needed. The check-in staff were wonderful and the lobby area clean. On our last day we found the business office where they allow you to print boarding passes for free. They have an underground parking lot with huge spaces and if fills up then they have additional outside Parking lots. The Whaler also supplies shopping carts to bring groceries upstairs. Our only negative if needed to mention would be that the parking spaces in the other lots are too close together. The garden grounds and ponds are well maintained and the pool was clean with plenty of chairs and cabana shades. The Whaler Village next door is nice for a quick bite or fancy dining, as well as, shopping.  Although they have a person in lobby to set up day trips we did not use the service. Lahaina which is 5 minutes away has everything. Shopping, tours, and a Safeway food store to stock up. Sign up for a Safeway card and save lots of money.  Excursions tips: Save your money and see the best snorkeling at Black rock for free. The Molokini crater snorkeling was nice, but very rough waters. There were more fish & turtle at black rock. If you do take the tour look for the Pacific Whale Foundation near the ocean center. They give a great trip at $51.00 with breakfast, lunch and all the equipment included. You will also be supporting their efforts to save the environment. The submarine tour is cute but overpriced. The best entertainment we saw was the Annabelle & Warren Comedy/magic show. All we can say is you must see this show. It is like nothing you have seen before and very funny at that.  We will tell all our friends and relatives to call Bob Thompson before they look anywhere else. This unit was a home away from home place to stay.

73315972,40,"Good Price, Good Location","In July 2010, I went to Maui to do some SCUBA Diving and hiking, and stayed at the Whaler for 8 nights.    The Whaler is located in the middle of a stretch of beach shared by several hotels. Right next to the Whaler is Whaler's Village, a mall with several restaurants and shops. Its along the west coast of the island, and about a one hour drive from the Kahului airport.    I booked a room with one king sized bed on Expedia. The room had a kitchen (pots, pans, cutlery, etc) a spacious bathroom, and a walk in closet with a safe. The kitchen included a full size fridge, stove top, dishwasher, and a coffee machine on the counter. The main part of the room had the king sized bed, flanked on each side by bed side tables, a couch along the wall, opposite of the bed, and a coffee table. Next to the couch was a round glass kitchen table with 4 wicker seats. Mounted to the wall left of the bed was a large flat screen TV, probably about 42 inches or more in size. Beneath the TV was a dresser. To the right of the bed was the lanai. In the hallway was the door that led into the bathroom/walk in closet. The bathroom was separated into two parts. When you walk into the bathroom, you'll have the sink in front of you, along with some additional drawers to the left of the sink. If you turn left, you walk through another door into a walk in closet that has additional space for you clothes and equipment, and a wall mounted safe. Inside the closet was an ironing board and an iron. If you turned right, and walked through another door, you'd find the toilet and a very spacious shower. The shower is tiled, with a mosaic on the wall. The shower had a large round shower head that reminded me of a sunflower. My only problem with the shower was that it took a long time to heat up.    The room did come with free high speed internet, but not wireless. The Whaler does having parking underneath the Whaler's Village parking deck, and I think they charged guests of the hotel $12 to park there for the day. They do have a ""business center"" but it consisted of 2 computers and a printer/fax machine. And in order to use the computers you had to swipe your credit card into a machine attached to the computer. There is also a small pool outside in front of the property, facing the beach. A small gym, a spa, and a sauna are located in the basement of one of the buildings. If you have a late flight they'll let you use the showers by the sauna to freshen up before you leave. The front desk also appears to be short staffed. I only ever saw one person working the front desk, no matter how busy it was. One day I saw about 20 people from a family reunion waiting in line as the desk clerk tried to help them all as quickly as he could. The service could have been better, but it wasn't for lack of trying on the part of the employee. They should really have at least 2 people working the desk, especially during the day.",Aug 2010,July 2010,Traveled solo,,NJ

The Whaler is a great place to stay if you are bringing your family to Maui...with that said, let this be a warning to those traveling without kids. There were children all over the place and so if you are looking to relax by the pool, this is not the place to do it!

My husband travels alot so we have a ton of marriott points but I would save those points for another trip because we were very impressed with the condo, its on the 7th floor looking over The Whaler Village. The patio is large enough to sit 3 people for lunch and 2 large lounger chairs, it was nice to be able to eat meals at the condo because Maui is quite expensive. A good tip is when you arrive at the airport stop by Costco (which is less than a mile from the airport) or Walmart and pick up some food to eat. This condo is great because they have 3 beach chairs in the closet (if you rent the chairs they cost $10 a day), they also had great beach toys as well. We snorkled right down on black rock by the Sheraton Hotel and my 16 yr old son got to feed a turtle seaweed there, the turtles are very used to people and they will come right up to you.

69809153,40,Whaler 162 or 164 for an excellent value!,"Just got back from 10 days at the Whaler and it was exactly what we were looking for. Excellent value for the money, very comfortable and well-appointed, remodeled rooms (see our pics). The Whaler is in between the big resort hotels, so you have all the amenities close by within short walking distance, without all the foot traffic and crowds right in your complex.    We stayed in 164 and our friends stayed right next door in 162. Both studios, ground floor, tower 2, north-facing onto the garden area. We could see Black Rock and watch the nightly torch lighting and cliff diving, right from our patios (see pic)!    Nice to be able to walk right out from our rooms onto the lawn and directly over to the pool or beach. Negative for 164 is that you’re right next to main tower entry door, so you see/hear people coming/going, and you can also hear the elevator bell. We acted as unofficial greeters, and really enjoyed getting to chat with folks. If you want more privacy and less noise for the same price, go just next door to 162, same layout and high-quality remodel.    If you really have to have a view room and are willing to pay a LOT more, then that’s your choice. We found it much more convenient to be on the ground floor and not have to go up/down elevator every time we wanted to go somewhere. Some have also commented here about the parking garage being in need of repair. Only thing we saw was pooled water over by tower 1 parking, no concrete falling from the ceiling. Others on this site have also commented about the age of the Whaler complex. True, it’s 30 or so years old, but it’s been well kept up. Some areas of the building could stand to be repaired, but nothing dangerous/unsafe.    Please note: we are experienced travelers to Maui, and have stayed at numerous condos and hotels in Ka’anapali, Kapalua, Kahana, etc. We are also quite picky, and will not stand for low-budget room quality or service. We also want to get our money’s worth, so we refuse to pay for seriously overpriced “luxury” hotels or condos. For the money, you can’t beat the Whaler. Besides being within walking distance of great shopping and restaurants, you’re only a few minutes’ drive away from dowtown Lahaina. The staff was FANTASTIC (again, we’ve had some bad experiences at other properties) and they went out of their way to make you feel like you were at home, instead of only on a short vacation.    We originally were looking at the El Dorado, as it was about $300 overall cheaper than the Whaler. However, their swimming pool was on top of the garage, and it was a short hike to the beach through the golf course. If you’re a golf enthusiast, the El Dorado would probably be a great choice. If you’re looking to have the pool, beach, and shopping convenient, then the Whaler can’t be beat.    Whaler Village, right next door, also has an ABC store for basic sundries and groceries. As many folks have commented here, the Safeway in Lahaina is best for normal groceries, otherwise stock up on bulk items at Costco just outside of Kahului airport. If you want to use the barbeque grills at the Whaler, best use tower 1’s as tower 2’s seemed to be always in use. Watch out though, since some of the burners are out of service.    Bottom line: excellent all-around accommodations, service, convenience, location, and value for the dollar.",Jul 2010,June 2010,Traveled as a couple,,"Eagle, Idaho"
68488026,40,We enjoyed the Whaler Room 263,"We stayed in the Whaler in June 2010 for 8 nights in room 263. The room was very nice, very modern with granite in the kitchen and bathroom. Stainless appliances, a huge comfortable king size bed, all the usual stuff, couch, dressers, nightstands, ceiling fan, table with four chairs where I set up my lap top. Plasma on the wall, DVD and CD player and FREE Internet. A small safe in the closet, there was no charge, however, it said on one of the papers at check in that there was a daily fee when the safe was used. The unit had two beach chairs and a cooler, we used the cooler several times at the beach and on the Road to Hana. The day we arrived there was a fresh cut pineapple in the fridge, very tasty and free. Our one and only complaint was that this unit is right next to the Whaler’s Village and you smell the kitchen at the Hula Grill restaurant a lot, and a bit of noise, but not bad. This is a garden view unit, but you have a nice view of the ocean from the balcony. We would sit and eat breakfast out there every night. Very quiet and very few people around the property. The maids came each day and cleaned, sometimes a bit early though. The outside of the building looks a bit dated, but room 263 was very nice and new. We were very pleased. Over all the guests were a bit older, but we didn’t mind. We are quiet for our age. There was tons of room on the beach and the pool area was usually available and they gave you free towels. The best part of the Whaler is the convenience of being next to the Whaler’s Village for food, shopping etc…This is not a Hyatt with all the bells and whistles, but it is just fine for us. We have stayed at the Hyatt and all you get there over the Whaler is a longer walk to the Whaler’s Village, a daily resort fee and no free Internet. The parking is underground and we never had any issues finding a spot right next to the elevator. It was great because when you would exit the parking lot and pull up to the parking lot attendant the lot attendant would smile and give you a “shaka” sign, or “hang loose” for mainlanders. We just loved that. It added a neat Hawaiian touch each time we left the property. This was our first time staying in a condo and we really enjoyed it. I would recommend the Whaler and plan to go back. Great food at the Hula Grill, we ate there several times. Aloha…",Jun 2010,June 2010,Traveled as a couple,,"San Diego, California"
68250099,40,"Ideal location, comfortable & fully equipped units","This was my second stay at The Whaler, and this time, I was on the top floor, in unit 1263. The owner has recently renovated, and the unit is lovely. Great lanai, kitchen and bathroom. No washer/dryer in unit (as in the last one), but it's just about 10 steps away near the lifts. You'll love having breakfast on the lanai, and the views to sea and mountains, with nice breeze. This side of tower 2 is a little louder due to Whaler's Village below, but the surf is quite a presence, so that's what you'll notice. Plus WV calls it a night quite early, at 9pm. Noise is generally not an issue. I'd advise going higher, though, get above the tree line if you're on that side for the views. Staff are good, very helpful and relaxed, they're very easy going here. the welcome pineapple in the fridge (and for us a welcome honeymoon bottle of champagne) is a nice touch.

64770904,50,Wonderful!!!!!!!,"We stayed in #1252 which is a penthouse condo at the Whaler. Though expensive, it was well worth the money and we split cost with daughter's family. Unit was large, comfortable and absolutely beautiful. The owner was very gracious and contacted us the 2nd day to make sure everything was fine and give us some hints about what to do there. The kitchen was well equipped. There were books, TV in every room, and beach chairs,etc. for our use. The walls were mirrored so that from every room and anywhere you looked you saw the ocean. It is a corner unit with a wrap-around lanai so if the wind is blowing on one side you can go to the other. It was quiet. The Whaler is right next door to Whaler Village and on a beautiful beach with Black Rock at the end. I can't say enough about how accommodating the owner was. He gave us a hint about rental cars. I followed his advise and got one cheaper and very reasonable. We received a check for our cleaning deposit three day after we returned home.

63035217,40,Good but could be better,"The rooms have been updated. In particular the kitchens and baths are much nicer than the last time we were there (5 years ago). The Lanais and the the views from them are speculator.    However, housekeeping leaves much to be desired. The daily housekeeping seems to consist of making beds and changing towels in the bathrooms. The kitchen counters had grit or dirt on them when we checked in and were never touched by housekeeping. They would not even place dirty dishes left on the counters into the dishwashers.    The pool policy of giving only one towel per guest was something I had not seen before and something I considered to be cheap. They may argue that it is a green initiative but when you are giving two people 8 towels in their condo is one more at the pool going to make that much difference?    We and a number of other guest had trouble with the electronic locks at the entrance to our building. Our room keys would not always open it. Some people had their room keys replaced but that really didn't seem to help.    Overall the rooms, views and location are fantastic.

62639163,50,"best sunsets ever! go for ocean front, book with owner (VRBO etc)","I was a Maui first timer and had no idea what to expect. I was totally overwhelmed by how awesome the Whaler condo was. Sure we didn't have the fancy pool you'd get at a Westin or Hyatt, but when you sat in our condo or on our lanai, it felt like we were surrounded by water on all sides (thanks to mirrored walls). You could hear the surf crashing in every room. I never wanted to leave the condo to go to the beach because it felt like we were already there. (Lucky for me since I was stuck in the condo a lot with my kids nap times.) Great soundproofing inside and outside the condo -- we could barely hear the kids waking up. Decor was a bit 1970s and pots and pan typical rental quality (costco) but we didn't mind a bit because we had the surf pounding in our ears and the sun setting directly outside our windows.  My hot tips: Go for an ocean front, not ocean view condo. World of difference to look directly out at the ocean, not at another condo block. Or if that's not available, go for any corner condo (the mountain behind Kaanapali is pretty stunning too, lots of rainbows back that way). The corners have HUGE lanais. Book directly with an owner, and if you are going in low season or at the last minute or for a long stay, try to negotiate a lower price. I thought a 2 bed 2 bath ocean front was way way out of budget, but I contacted the owner through VRBO and she cut the price by 40% since it was last minute and I wanted a 10 night stay. We were on the 3rd floor but any corner condo on any floor would probably be similarly awesome. Don't worry about not having support because you booked with an individual owner not some big company -- we had to call the Whaler maintenance a couple times (small leak, door wouldn't lock) and they always came right away and fixed the problem immediately. If you have young kids and need a crib, shop around the different rental places because their prices vary a lot. We bought a pack and play at Walmart for $70 on our way in from the airport because it was cheaper than renting.

The best thing is the beach. I love going out the door and walking to the sand and hitting the beautiful Ocean. Although we don't spend much time in the room as we golf, zip line, whale watch, and golf some more, it is always hit or miss. Sometimes you get a room that has been remodeled but often we hit one like this time that is old and beat up. For instance this one has no screens on the door. Not a good thing in Maui. So make sure your renter or Aston gives you pictures. Aston people seem to always have a bad attitude for a happy place. I always say the fish rots from the head. What's with Hawaii and all their taxes. Triple Taxes on car rental, Taxes on golf, Taxes on massage. And what's with the local rate. That's how they get around all the tourist rip off.

61768318,30,The New Pool Fence :-(,"We have stayed at The Whaler about a dozen times over the past 2 decades and always had wonderful experiences. The condo's we've been in have been clean and well-maintained and the staff have been good. The ocean-front corner Lanai's are second to none on Kaanapali. We won't be back though and it's because of the new pool fence.    Many will not be bothered by the fence and for them I'd highly recommend The Whaler. For us though the fence completely changed the atmosphere around the pool. We used to be able to lay by the pool and have wonderful views of the beach, Black Rock, nearby islands, people walking by, etc. Those views, where still available, now include a LOT of aluminum. The pool area always felt connected to the beach but is now separated.    The Whaler has always been kind of understated but nice in appearance. It now has a decided 'Motel 6' feel to it. It always fit in well with other properties along Kaanapali, but now sticks out like an ugly sore thumb.    Whaler mgmt states that they were required by law to install the fence, yet no other property along Kaanapali has such a fence. Even if it was installed just to reduce insurance costs and non-guests from using the pool, they could have chosen a fence with smaller spindles of a darker color that would be less obtrusive overall and that would impact views from the pool area less. They could have chosen to do something that would fit in better with the attractive quality of the other properties along Kaanapali. They did neither.

This complex is close to shopping, snorkling at Blackrock, is situated on the beach and is next to the lovely boardwalk which travels the entire length of Kaanapali beach. Unlike some other resort properties located in Kaanapali, the Whaler is located on a beautiful sandy beach with no rocks. Leave your beach towels at home, the Whaler provides beach towels for you.  The rooms were very spacious and more than met our family's needs. We were situated on the ground floor facing the inner courtyard and we found that this was ideal for the kids when going to/coming from the pool and/or beach. The property has 5 gas barbeques which are situated next to the boardwalk with a view of the ocean and the beach. Due to the time of year that we were here, we were treated to daily whale displays, which were visible from the beach.

58799994,50,Fell in love with Maui,"We spent 5 days in Maui starting March 1st. We went to the Big Island for 5 days after too.  Our last time to the island was 31 years ago. We were first off blown away with the wonderful roads from the airport to Kaanapali. It was clear sailing and took us about 45 minutes. It was such an experiece to drive along this scenic route. I don't think I could ever get tired of it. We saw so many whales along the shore, this time of the year I guess they are very plentiful.  We stayed at the Whaler with an ocean view on the 11th floor. It was so beautiful. This condo had just been refurbished. It was #1160, we loved this unit. They had a memory foam on the bed and it was heavenly. I don't know when I've slept so well.  I live in Florida so just laying on the beach does not do it for me but I have to say that the waves were quite big and a lot of people were body surfing and it was fun to watch. The beach in that area is very nice and quite large. I wanted to drive around and see some of the sights. We went to Makena beach to check this out and see how it had changed in 31 years.We did the scenic road trip on the west coast to Nakalele. We drove down to where the blow hole is.It's a winding road but not as bad as the road to Hana. We also went to Ioa Valley state park and enjoyed that too. It's something to see and it's free to walk all around. We fell in love with Maui all over again and are hoping once we retire that we will check into buying a place over there to escape the hot, humid summers of steamy Florida.  We loved dining at the Plantation restaurant in Napilii. we went there twice. I would suggest dining before sunset so you can really enjoy the view to the ocean. We went later and did not get to enjoy that. We went to Maui Brewing Co and enjoyed some of their home brewed beer. I loved the Blonde bikini beer, they also have a delicious BBQ chicken pizza. We went to Roy's restaurant, We were hoping to get their pre fixe menu but you have to get there early for that. They only offer that for the first hour they are open. We really enjoyed Mama's Fish House for lunch too. It's pricey but what an experience we had. We also ate at Cane and Taro for breakfast once. It was good and not too pricey.

We were a little skeptical about the murphy bed, as these are sometimes not very comfortable, and the size of the studio condo. However, we couldn't have been more pleased with the unit once we got there. The king sized murphy bed was very comfortable- even for me at 7 months pregnant! Also, for the 4 nights we were there, the size of the unit was perfectly fine. The building is fine, the pool is small but comfortable and the beach is a stones throw from your door. The pineapple delivered to us on our arrival was quite a nice touch. There is a small gym in the basement but really has everything you could need. Also, there was free internet access in the room which was nice.  A few things we learned about Lahaina- Mala on Front Street is a great restaurant, the restaurants in Old Lahaina village are touristy and forgettable.

56813104,40,"Was Initially Disappointed, Then Very Pleased","We arrived at the Condo very late (2am) and our initial 24 hours went something like this:  -were surprised that parking was $12 per night in addition to cost of hotel  -no double beds, but one king and a sofa bed (we had requested double beds and did not know until after inquiring that this room type does not have doubles)  -as we learned in the morning there was a room under construction on one side of us (no kidding that they were using an electric saw at 8am) and the other side was the elevator, garbage disposal, and automatic sliding door leading to the outside. It was not quiet to say the least.  -we went to the service desk and she said she would try and work something out, even suggesting upgrading us to another unit that was open.  -we went back about 2 hours later and this person had left for the day and did not pass along our complaint/request to the next person  -this next person said that there was no room to move, but would contact the room next door to request that construction stopped.  -we went back to our room later on (about 5'ish) and the electric saw was in full throttle  -we went back a third time to the front desk and another woman who was unfamiliar with our predicament told us that they have no control over other units and construction since they have an individual owner. She said she would have the manager follow up with us.  Things turning around for the good:  -this time the manager called us and offered another room. It had original 70's decor and appeared quite grungy. Our unit (as noisy as it was), was newly decorated with top of the line appliances, a separate shower (which is great with two girls), two sinks (another bonus with two girls) and a huge, new TV. The only real issue with our unit was the location. We decided to stay with our first unit and hope for the best.  -The construction sounds became alot quieter and rarely began at 8am and I think we became somewhat accustomed to the elevator, garbage sounds and sliding door.  -The pool, hottub and the courtyard are beautiful with enough chairs for guests.  -They had an ice cream social at the pool which was such a nice touch.  -The location along the beach and next to Whaler Village is second to none  -The closeness to Lahaina came in very handy.  -The manager checked back with us another time to see if we were OK and that the noise was less from the room next door (classy, good service)  A few tips:  -if you are renting boogie boards or snorkelling equipment, it is sooo much cheaper in Lahaina to rent (the store we rented at was along Front Street as you enter Lahaina with superb service. He pointed us to a place to snorkel not on the maps and it was perfect).  -ABC store at Whaler Village has tremendous value, also Safeway in Lahaina has wonderful fruit  -Loved, loved, loved the Warren and Annebelle Magic show in Lahaina. Was very funny (and no crudeness in the jokes).  -Lahaina luau was wonderful  -Cheeseburger Cafe in Lahaina so good  -Friday Art Walk in Lahaina was so much fun  -Little town called Paia (a bit of a drive and on the way to ""road to Hana"") was charming to visit (true surfer town), Milagro Food Co. such a great restaurant and reasonable prices, amazing surfing to view at Hookipa lookout (I may have spelled that wrong).

On this visit we split up our trip and stayed 3 nights on South Maui at the Marriott in Wailea and 4 nights at The Whaler. While enjoying our stay in Wailea, we liked the Kaanapali area much better. We also decided that staying in this particular condo makes the vacation for us. The Whaler is in a great location close to restaurants and we love the beachwalk. You can walk to one of several luaus, not having to worry about drinking and driving. The Hula Grill and Leilani's (great Hula Pie!) are great places to eat.

It has a wonderful location, situated in the middle of Kaanapali beach making easy access to everything by foot. Check in was simple, and considering we didn't want to pay the extra for our balcony to face the beach we still had a killer view of the sand and surf. The room came equipped with a refrigerator, stove, coffee pot, dishes, utensils, etc. The only thing it was lacking was a washer and dryer (but we were so close to the laundry facilities it didn't matter). The unit is within spitting distance of the elevator, but you never hear it or the foot traffic in the halls. In fact, the only way we knew that there were people around us was that one night we could faintly smell some popcorn in someone elses microwave.  So why not room 414? Quite frankly, the bed was terrible. It was a king size bed, and the mattress was hard as a rock. I've slept on my share of hard mattresses (I spent six years on a futon) but this took the cake.

We've stayed at Marriott (before they were sucker timeshares), Kaanapali Beach Hotel and The Whaler. The last 5 years we've stayed at The Whaler exclusively because of the great location and the fact that they are condo's so when you are staying a couple of weeks having a kitchen and bbq helps with cost. The Whaler costs a bit more than other places past Black Rock but so worth it. We stayed in unit 965 for 11 nights, the room was clean and pretty. Some reviewers complain about overlooking Whalers Village but we specifically choose to stay in Tower Two which overlooks Whaler's Village because you don't have another tower of condo's looking down onto you and we enjoy sitting on the lanai and listening to the night sounds and the entertainment from The Hula Grill. We will never stay anywhere else on Maui.    And for the silly people who write reviews like ""they only clean once a week"".....you are renting a ""CONDO"" from an actual person who owns the unit.

49771820,50,"Whaler 863, The Thrill of Victory","I am writing this as I am sitting on the lanai of the condo. Renting a condo over the internet is often a “Thrill of victory or agony of defeat” proposition. Whaler unit 863 is definitely a thrill of victory. We went to Maui to look for a studio unit in Whalers to purchase. We looked at 9 other studio units and none were anywhere near comparable to 863. The interior has at least $75,000 in upgrades including obvious professional designer input. The unit was spotlessly clean and very well equipped from the kitchen to the other amenities including folding beach chairs and beach coolers for guest use. The lanai even has raised chairs and a table so you are enjoying the view OVER the railing and not looking through the bars like you are in prison. Very few other units in the Whaler have this, and just goes to show the thought that the owners have put into the unit.    Lest I be thought an owners “Stoolie” I do have one or two points, admittedly minor. Being on the south side of Whalers II the air conditioning units for the shopping village are nearby providing a mildly irritating hum when sitting on the lanai. With the doors closed however, this noise is never heard. My wife also thought a small portable fan and a magnifying make up mirror would be nice. Maybe also a backgammon set, deck of cards or a few DVD's for those rainy days.    We own 4 vacation rental properties including on Kauai and know a well run operation when we see it.

49539044,40,Loved The Whaler - Unit 315,"We stayed in unit 315 from 11/10-11/17, and I don't think we could have picked a better place for the money. We rented by the owner, through vbro.com, and got a better rate for an ocean view room than staying anywhere around there. Unit 315 is facing south, in Tower 1, with beautiful views of the newly constructed courtyard, and a great view of the ocean. This side had no construction noise at all-just the sound of the waves all the time. This is a studio, but it was like having a hotel room with a full kitchen. The room, I could tell, was highly upgraded compared to some of the others I had peaked at (nice cabinets, stainless steel, granite, tile in shower was really nice). The pics on their website are very accurate. The Whaler is a condo, so it is also a very quiet place-didn't hear alot of partying going on. If you enjoy cooking and like to BBQ, this is a great place too. We also ate out a few times at the Hula Grill, next door, which was very good - but can be expensive especially with drinks. Shopping at the Whaler's Village is a lot of fun, also next door. If you're planning on buying your food, there is a Safeway near the Cannery Mall, not too far away. There is also a Costco and Walmart, near the airport, in case you want to get things before you get to the hotel. The Walmart, though, doesn't carry meat items though. The Whaler reserved 2 excursions for us - snorkeling and a tour to the road to Hana. Both were a lot of fun. I recommend a tour to Hana, rather than driving it yourself, because the driver would have to constantly keep his/her eye on the road, rather than enjoying the scenery. There's lots of sharp turns and one lane roads, as well as unpaved road that cause a lot of flat tires. On our last day, we had to check out by 11:00 a.m., but the staff at the Whaler offerred to hold our bags until later that evening, as our flight left at 10:30 at night. That day, we spent it in downtown Lahaina, lots of souvenier and T-shirt shops, but fun. We also went to a late afternoon movie there. Surprisingly, the prices of the movies were cheaper than home.

49072774,40,Choose your room carefully!!! Can be Noisy!!!,We stayed at the Whaler in late Aug / early September. The rented the condo through VRBO.com. The condo was recently remodeled and absolutely beautiful. The owner has done a great job. The location of the property is perfect. The grounds are very nice. They have occasional gathesings with free snacks and drinks by the pool. Our condo was overlooking the Whalers Village. Every buisiness in the Whalers Village has air conditioners that run pretty much non stop. About 7:00 am you also have delivery trucks beeping as they back up and noisy trash trucks about twice a week. Sometimes the guys working down in the Whales Village are dropping wooden pallets on the asphalt. You can pretty much forget a quite afternoon on the Lanai listening to the waves. So my advice... Whalers is a great plce to stay but DO NOT get a condo overlooking the Whalers Village.,Nov 2009,September 2009,Traveled as a couple,,"Grass Valley, CA"

After a quick glitz during check in {due to bad communication with the condo owner} we had a wonderful week at the Whaler. It was great being next to Whalers Village and 3 great resturants. The Whaler was clean and the reno of the grounds and pool are beautiful! We loved being able to have a quick breakfast on our lania and then spend the rest of the day on the beach.

We didn't want to have to worry about eating out for every meal and then not having anywhere to even store the expensive left overs. We also chose the first floor so we could go in and out without having to deal with a lobby and elevator chaos, well ironically- we were in a condo right against the elavator shaft. We rented the place from an owner on a vacation rental site and of course she was not going to tell us about the ""problem"" but you almost want to cry when you spend 1800 bucks to not be able to sleep in past 7am or take any naps. If you want to stay at this place- ask whomever -where the unit is (not near the elevator). If you can get a condo for the same price anywhere else on the beach-I think this is the oldest one-so pick somewhere else. oh, and the pool is lame compared to the neighbors.

46303443,40,Wow!!,"This was a return trip to Maui and I remembered seeing this property on my first visit. I was a little hesitant to pick the property because of the various reviews concerning some of the rooms not being up to a proper standard for the money one paid. However, I decided to take a chance and paid extra for an ocean front room. I was fortunate to get a high floor in Tower Room I and I must say from the minute we arrived until we left the entire stay was delightful. The staff we dealt with were extremely friendly and helpful. The room was well appointed and the view was out of this world. We found ourselves not wanting to leave on most evenings preferring to just sit and watch the beautiful sunsets or the garden between the towers. The only negative I could find was there was concrete chipping from the ceiling or work they were doing in the garage and the underground parking situation was not what I would have liked. Yet, this was a small inconvenience compared to everything else. The property has a very nice pool with plenty of amenities. The Whaler is situated on a nice stretch of clean beach and within easy walking distance of the shopping mall, which included some nice restaurants to enjoy a meal, drinks, dessert, and of course beautiful sunsets. All in all, we chose a mix of eating out and fixing meals in our condo and couldn't have been more pleased.    As for outside activities we took the Maui Spectacular 1.5 hour helicopter tour with Blue Hawaiian and it was outstanding. We also had ocean front massages at the 4 Seasons at Wailea and it was awesome. We had only one other night that we could have an off site activity and were torn between a luau and something else. We reluctantly chose Warren and Annabelles magic show at Lahaina. I must tell you this was one of the best things we did. Not only is this guy fantastic, doing things that none of us could explain, but the entire evening was filled with comedy. I can't remember when I have laughed so hard during an evening. I highly recommend any of these three activities as you can't go wrong.    The only question now is not if but when we will be back to the Whaler.

This is our third stay at the Whaler, and it's never dissapointed us. The major construction is over, and the property has come back to it's relaxing, low key atmosphere. The pool has been re-done, and there are new lounge chairs. The Whaler has a great location right next door to Whaler's Village, and within walking distance of many good places to eat. We stayed in an 8th floor studio with a huge ocean view that also overlooked the courtyard and pool. We used a local realtor, Monte D. Fitts, to rent the studio. The room was updated, clean, and had a great bed. We stocked the kitchen up at Safeway, and used the Whaler's BBQ area several nights. The staff is very friendly, the rates are reasonable, and it's just a great place to stay. We'll be back again.    Bruce & Sheila  Mesa, AZ",Oct 2009,September 2009,Traveled as a couple,,"Mesa,Az"

The Unit itself is recently remodeled which was great but the only thing I wish it had was a screen door for the patio so I can leave the door open at night to be lulled to sleep by the ocean waves. Aside from that, very comfortable unit.    The new courtyard and pool is great. I loved the addition of the free cabana like lounge chairs on a first come first served basis and the complimentary lemonade in the early afternoon is a nice touch. Glad that they added a place to print boarding passes which was very convenient but is only open though M-F 8-5.    Value for that location can't be beat as with a full kitchen you can eat breakfast on your spacious lanai and can BBQ a few meals with their grill saving you $ from eating 3 meals a day outside with hotels.

We loved being able to BBQ onsite within view of the ocean waves breaking onshore and walking next door for a great meal at Hula Grill.

35581163,50,Comfortable stay in unit 1257 (Tower 2)- Construction is complete!,"Before I even start my review, I have to say we love the Whaler. We've stayed there 4 or 5 times. We love the South side of Tower 2 overlooking Whaler Village. We love staying on Ka'anapali Beach. No place is going to suit everyone, but the Whaler suits us perfectly. It's a condo. That means no room service, but you can fix your own breakfast, make sandwiches for picnics, and barbeque dinner when you don't feel like going out. It also means the pool is just a pool, no fancy water slides, no swim up bar...which tends to limit the number of shrieking children and drunken adults.    You can rent a unit from the Whaler or directly from the owner. When you use the Whaler you'll be assigned whatever unit is available when you arrive. We did that the first time we stayed, and loved our unit. Since then we've always rented from owners so we could get exactly what we want, and know our location in advance. The two towers are parallel to each other, so half of the units face the newly landscaped courtyard and pool. They also face each other. Tower 1 owners call their tower the quiet tower. The North side of Tower I faces Black Rock, a great snorkeling beach. I would suspect you'd need to be above the 5th or 6th floor though not to be looking directly into trees or the next hotel along the walkway. The North sides of both towers have little to no sun on their lanais. Tower 2 is next to the Whaler Village, a pleasant little shopping area. If you have a courtyard unit that will make no difference at all. If you have a unit on the South side, you'll have a view of trees until about the 4th or 5th floor. Above that, you'll have an ocean view, and look down on the shopping center. Personally, we think that's fun. We like hearing the music from the Hula Grill and special programs Whaler Village puts on, and we like the sun on our lanai (except during the summer when the sun is almost directly over the whaler). But you can hear the activity.    Enough of the Whaler in general and location of units in tower. You can bring up a floor plan on line. Unit 1257 is on the top floor of Tower 2 on the South side. It's a one bedroom, two bath unit. With the lanai, which is large enough for 2 lounges and a table with 4 chairs, there is over 1,000 sq.ft. of living area. There are floor to ceiling, wall to wall windows/doors in both the living room and bedroom. Both baths have shower/tub combinations, and the master also has a stacked washer/dryer. The water's hot, the pressure's good, and the towels are plush. Everything we need. The full kitchen is well stocked with dishes, glassware, utensils, and of course a dishwasher. Everything was exceptionally clean. While unit 1257 is not ocean front it is the very next unit, so you can see the both the ocean and the mountains from inside the living room and bedroom. There is no need to crane your neck for a glimpse. The furniture was comfortable, the owners were easy to work with, and responded quickly whenever we had a question. If you're interested in a condo on Ka'anapali, This particular unit has a small work area that is all set up to plug in your own laptop. I would highly recommend this unit. We found this unit through VRBO, and it's their listing #112544. All the descriptions were accurate.",Jul 2009,June 2009,Traveled as a couple,,"Portland, OR"

Parking was next to the elevator and the elevator was a short walk from our room. The fold out bed in the living room she said was comfortable.

33087921,40,A Relaxing Place to Stay,"Unlike the larger, fancier resorts found on Kaanapali, which tend to be full of crowds, The Whaler offers some real peace and quiet.    We rented two units from the same owner -- a one bedroom unit at 720 and a studio unit at 814. Both were amazing. In fact, the bellman commented on how we ended up with some of the nicest rooms he has ever seen at the resort. Both had new everything with state of the art televisions and appliances. I stayed in unit 720 and my in-laws were in 814. The bed in 720 was so comfortable, it was tough to get out of bed in the morning! The unit had umbrellas, beach chairs, and snorkeling equipment available. There was also every utensil you could imagine needing in a condo, including an espresso machine. I would definitely rent these units again and highly recommend them to anyone.    The pool area is nice and clean. The water is comfortable. In addition to the regular loungers, there are also shaded and padded loungers available for free at the pool-- you just need to be sure to reserve them in advance by putting your name down at the towl counter. I didn't discover this until the day before we left -- I thought you had to pay! There are also shaded loungers and umbrellas available for use at the beach for a fee.    The BBQs were a nice convenience. However, watch out that there can be a short wait if you plan to use them around 6 pm. Of course, waiting is no problem because you have some nice people to chat with while you watch the Maui sunset. Not a bad way to spend an evening.    The closeness to Whalers Village is a huge asset. You can get takeout food from any of the restaurants if you want to eat on your patio or go to the food court in the Whalers Village for a quick bite.",Jun 2009,June 2009,Traveled with family,,"Gilbert, Arizona"
31261410,40,Great experience at the Whaler,"We just completed our stay at the Whaler and had a great time. The condo we were staying in (tower 2 , 2 bedroom, ocean front, 9th floor) was recently renovated and was very nice. The construction on the courtyard is within a week of completion and was of no issue to us and looks gorgeous. The staff was friendly, price reasonable compared to other area condos and hotels we researched.    It's hard to beat the location. The beach is one of the best in the world, the pool is a nice alternative, good gym, shopping right next door, world class golf across the street, and good restaurants within walking distance.    Do plan on going to Costco on your way from airport to stock up on food and staples, though there are 2 grocery stores within 5 minutes drive of the condo. We used the bbq area (gas) several times and made for a great picnic by the ocean.

30046958,50,One of the best decisions we made on this trip!,"Just came back about a week ago from our trip to Maui. The Whaler was one of the best decisions we made on this trip. Overall, Maui underwhelmed me, but I loved the Whaler. We had a 1 bed/2 bath in unit 1057 in Tower 2 (the one next to Whaler's Village). Awesome location. 2nd unit from the beach. This unit has two sliding doors (one for the living room, one for the bedroom) that open out to the HUGE lanai. Great view of the beach as there were no trees to obstruct our view and Whaler's Village only goes up a couple stories. Room was nicely appointed. Short walk and easy access to Whaler's Village (there's a key card door that sticks you right into the middle of Whaler's Village so you don't have to go around to the traditional entrances).    Yes, it's under construction so the middle part and the underground parking garage don't look the greatest. That was disclosed so it wasn't a big deal. They're making some real progress and it looks like it's gonna be beautiful when they're done. The pool was pretty nice and the outdoor showers were working.    Our mattress was incredibly comfortable. I think it's more comfortable than our mattress at home, and we'd just bought it a few months ago and it cost about $2K if I remember correctly. The sofa bed outside sucked though.    My only wish is that they vacuumed more often. We tried our best to keep sand out of the carpet, but since we had a 1 yr old, he dropped some sand and tiny bits of food that we couldn't pick up by hand. Otherwise, considering the huge room, lanai that's twice as big as the properties next to the Whaler, and perfect location, I couldn't be happier. Easily one of the best decisions we made on this trip (the others being Warren & Annabelle's and eating at Sensai's).    My SIL had room 518. Studio. Very nice as well. I think even better appointed than 1057. But it's in Tower 1. You could see the ocean, but you gotta be out on the lanai and gotta crane your neck a bit. You gotta work for the view. There are trees and the huge tower from the next property blocking most of the view. No underground parking for this tower either. Our room, 1057, had nice views even if you were standing in the kitchen or at the front door. Absolutely unobstructed.    Go for the units with a 2nd bathroom if you get a 1 bedroom unit. If you look at the property maps, you can tell you have a much better chance at a room with a better view with the 2 bathroom units if you compare the locations of the 1 bd/1 bth vs the 1 bd/2 bth units. With a kid, I'm soooo glad we got a condo instead of a hotel room.    Oh, and there was a crib when we arrived. Can't remember if I requested one, but it was there. Didn't use it though cuz the little guy likes to sleep with us but I liked how it was there and we didn't have to ask for one if we wanted.",May 2009,May 2009,Traveled with family,,"Sacramento, California"
28573809,40,Fabulous Location on One of the World's Most Beautiful Beaches,"We've traveled to Hawaii several times, and stayed twice at the Whaler, once in unit 1018 and once on the 12th floor. We travel with another couple and have always enjoyed ourselves to the max. In Tower 1 with a view of Black Rock, sitting on the lanai for morning coffee is awesome (or any other time, for that matter!). We love the beachwalk that passes by restaurants and hotels, and usually walk from one end to the other & back, every evening after dinner. The smell of flowers is everywhere, and with a soft breeze, lilting music from the restaurants, tiki torches along the way, and the gentle sound of the ocean, you couldn't find a more pleasant place to take an evening stroll. We highly recommend the Whaler as a place for a low-key, relaxed, island vacation. Having your own condo with kitchen means sparing the expense and hassle of eating every meal out (unless you like that kind of thing.) The only downside was the garage, in that there were some leaks when we were there last time, with some areas cordoned off; OTOH, I believe that's being renovated. On the whole, the property is very well maintained, with attractive garden & pool areas. If you book at the Whaler, go for Tower 1, facing north....the best view....and on a high floor for an unobstructed view of Black Rock. Once you're settled in, you'll want to stock your kitchenette; on the way back from the grocery store (located a short distance away in Lahaina, & elsewhere), find a shopping cart in the Whaler garage (they're parked by the door in) to carry your groceries inside and up to your floor. We also love the close proximity to restaurants, and to Whalers Village (upscale shopping center), right next door. Nothing beats dinner at the Hula Grill or Leilaini's, enjoying a gorgeous Maui sunset. Looking forward to our next visit to the Whaler in March, 2010.

28115988,40,The Whaler--Good value on Ka'anapali Beach,"We booked #714, a studio unit, through Maui Beachfront Rentals. This particular unit could stand some updating, but was functional, and being located in the heart of Ka'anapali Beach, we hardly spent any time in the room, anyway. They could improve this unit by adding a room safe (available in most other units) and providing a few more towels for our 8-day stay. The reservations process with MBR was professionally handled.    Our friends traveled with their daughter and rented a 1-bedroom 2-bath unit. These units are almost twice the size of the studios, and were much more comfortable for a family or even a couple wanting a bit more space. We put the Whaler's beachfront gas grills to good use while we were there, and enjoyed the views and first-rate beach immensely.    As a whole, the Whaler provides decent value for money. There is some construction going on at the moment, but it is supposed to be wrapped up by the end of June. I do wish they would fix the showers outside to wash the sand off your feet.

When we checked in they said for for the work being done at the resort and gave us a two for one coupon for a luau, some other coupons for two for one and some free things, and a $100 traverls check.

24518694,40,A bit worn but still a great location,"We chose The Whaler for its convenient location on Kaanapali Beach and booked through Resort Quest (now Aston). I had requested a room away from construction noise and was told in advance that that could not be guaranteed. There were no surprises with the booking other than that we were given #1214 in Tower 1--the best studio view available, I think! (Black Rock view and lots of beach in OV category.)    Because the units are individually owned, there is a lot of variation in upgrades and decor. The decorating theme of our unit (the captain's quarters of a yacht) was rather unique, though tastefully done. The bathroom had not been upgraded from the original marble counter, floor and tub surround.    The only complaint we had was the rather sketchy maid service. We were there a week, and I think our sheets were changed only once--on Sunday--and we left Tuesday! The bathtub was cleaned only once, as well. The unit could stand a thorough dusting and carpet cleaning.    The Whaler is a little worn but hopefully will be restored to some of its former status.

24016176,10,Beware! Many Units are Individually Owned! Avoid Unit 364!,"After reading good reviews for the Whaler, on Kaanapali beach, I decided to stay. I got a great deal since they were under construction (or so I thought until I was given my invoice at the end of the stay). There were fees attached that were never discussed. I was extremely disappointed. It was printed in fine print that there ""may be other fees included "". My fault for not looking into that.  The room had carpet that must've been 30 years old. A lot of dust in the corners, and some little bugs. It was terribly dirty and I didnt even want to take my shoes off. The drains didnt drain in the bathroom. Some people may not be as concerned about cleanliness but if you are, DO NOT BOOK UNIT 364 AT THE WHALER!    I happened to book the stay through Whaler's Realty. That was a terrrible experience. I had a great place booked elsewhere on the island but since the Whaler seemed like such a great deal and the pictures didnt look so bad, I switched hotels. I wish I would've kept my original plans. I would have spent less money in the end and had a much better room! Lesson learned!    I write a review only to save future clients from having the same experience. If you consider the Whaler, go directly through the hotel itself or at least read the fine print if you rent an individually owned condo.

23072885,50,Whaler 112 was great!,"In spite of another renter’s bad review of Whaler 112, we had a GREAT time. The condo is located on the very quiet side of Tower One, with a great lawn area just outside the living room so we had just steps to go to the beach, the pool and the BBQ. Yes, there was construction going on but we could barely hear any of it from our side of the building, especially when the doors were closed.    The condo was beautifully decorated, air conditioned, had ceiling fans in the living room and bedroom, very comfortable king bed, a large LCD TV in the living room and a large TV in the bedroom. It looked like the appliances in the kitchen were nearly new. Very homey, Hawaiian, elegant feeling. We felt like we had been there before even though we hadn’t.    It was everything we expected and more. Yes, there was construction going on at the time, but we were told about this and the condo was discounted to account for this.    We have NO PROBLEM with Blue Moon Rentals. They were great. Maybe the other reviewer was mad about something else because we stayed in the same place and found it terrific.

22727682,40,"Loved the Whaler, don't pick this specific condo","We had a fabulous vacation in Maui, our 2nd time at Kannapali Beach. (last time we stayed at the Mahana, which was great, but too far from a swimmable beach). The Whaler's location is perfect. You can walk to shops and restaurants and the snorkeling in front of the Sheraton is great and FREE. We have done tour boats before in Hawaii and would just research the beach and find one that you can snorkel from (unless you want to interact with people, which we didn't). See my Kauai review for even more amazing snorkeling.    The Whaler location being great and affordable. Our condo was also in a very nice building, staff was helpful and friendly, the business center was well equipped for the couple of business needs we had to take care of. Our condo itself was actually very nice. Great view, very clean HOWEVER... don't rent it unless the owner went to Macy's and did some shopping. The bedding should be thrown away, I felt like I slept on someone's bed in college. Lumpy pillows, thin blanket, old sheets and towels. If I found the walmart or macys earlier in the trip I would have gotten new pillows myself. This condo is at [-] - pick the Whaler, just not this place. I would have not written anything, but did contact the owner and after 2 weeks have heard nothing back.    Even while being their during the renovations they are doing the Whaler was nice, but you may really want to stay somewhere else until they are over. Jackhammers a little much at times.    I rate it above average for the property and if the owner goes to Macys and tosses out this old stuff it would be perfect. I was really surprised it was rented this way.",Dec 2008,November 2008,Traveled as a couple,,"Harleysville, Pennsylvania"

22358301,50,Excellent Service and Studio,"I stayed at The Whaler from 15-20 November 2008, as I was attending a conference at the Maui Sheraton Resort. It was my first trip to Hawaii.    I picked The Whaler as it is right next to the Whaler's village, where you can get your supplies from the ABC store, have your meals at restaurants or the food court there, and even catch hula shows on some evenings.    Even though I arrived early (around 11am), I was able to check in and was assigned room 1161. It is a studio with an ocean view. It must be the best studio with an ocean view in the building - the sunset is absolutely gorgeous, and the room is spacious, and very nicely furnished. Everyone who stayed in this room was more than satisfied.    After checking out on 20 Nov 2008, I stopped over in Honolulu for 2 days before heading back home. I realised when I arrived in Honolulu that I had left my handphone in the room at the Whaler. I called them, and to my relief, they found my phone in the room.  I was told to leave my address in Singapore so that they would mail the phone to me, and charge the postage to my credit card.    This morning, I received a long-distance call from The Whaler to inform me that the phone is on its way to me.    I have been very impressed with both the quality of the room, as well as the politeness and service level of the staff. I would highly recommend anyone travelling to Maui to stay at the Whaler.",Dec 2008,November 2008,Traveled on business,,"Singapore, Singapore"

We had arrived from Australia earlier and had spent nearly 24 hours straight travelling - we were exhausted. At reception, they were kind enough to phone the cleaner who was happy to allow us into the condo hours before the official check in time. Thank you Starr. The condo was just magnificant - spacious, spotlessly clean, very well equiped and the views from every direction from both the lanai and inside just cannot be beaten.

21155035,10,Never again,"We were aware of the lobby & pool renovations but not told that there were rooms also being remodeled. That noise was the worst. Our ocean view room was of the trees and hotel next door that was being remodeled. Front desk said Ocean View and partial ocean view are the same. Our couch was found after dumpster diving--ripped with stuffing coming out. $12 a day to park--at the risk of your life! You are given a notice to beware of falling cement and slippery puddles when parking in the garage. Difficult to get parking amid the trucks and materials, let alone trying to get out if you got blocked in. You have access to the pool next door, but if you want a lounge chair for the beach its $10 a day. We're made to feel like we are the inconvenience and mgmt doesn't care about the complaints or try to make your stay more comfortable. Even if the renovations come out spectacular, its for that reason that I would never stay there again.",Oct 2008,October 2008,Traveled as a couple,,California
21147325,50,No Problems At The Whaler!,The Whaler was fine. I would say anyone considering The Whaler should stay there. Just make sure you are on the outside of either tower. The pool will be open in November and the construction is not a bother.  We stay in the south tower on the 10th floor and have always enjoyed the view and Whalers Village below. It offers plenty of people watching and the sounds in the evening are soothing and add to the tropical ambiance.  Parking was not a problem and as far as fees are concerned I do not know of any resort that does not have fees.  All in all our recent stay at The Whaler was great. It was quiet and not crowded at all. Actually nothing on Kaanapali is crowded right now. Tourism in Hawaii is down anywhere from 17.5-24%. If you negotiate with an owner on the Towers outside condos you can get a great deal. We did and we got our usual stay at the best location on Kaanapali bar none.,Oct 2008,October 2008,Traveled as a couple,,Denver CO
21098818,50,#661 is the Perfect Condo in Paradise,"We returned recently from our 2nd stay in #661 at The Whaler. This condo is decorated beautifully and has great views from all angles. We have been right at home instantly each time. Everything you need is right there and it is so nice to be able to have breakfast and any other meal on the lanai with such a tremendous view. We saw many people using the gas grills and eating on the picnic tables on the premises. The Whaler location is perfect. It is on a great beach and you can walk to restaurants and shopping at Whaler’s Village. It’s a short drive to Lahaina which has lots of shops and many boating activities leave from the harbor. This year we spent lots of time just walking the beautiful beach and watching the spectacular sunsets. Snorkeling, cocktail cruises and dinner cruises leave right from this beach. This year the pool was closed for renovation but is expected to open in November. The Whaler is undergoing a big renovation which will make it even nicer, but the construction didn’t bother us at all and #661 does not overlook the construction. I can’t say enough about #661 at The Whaler except that it’s the perfect condo in Paradise and we look forward to returning.",Oct 2008,September 2008,Traveled as a couple,,Pennsylvania
20915350,20,We rented Unit 805 from a very dishonest owner,"You need to read this if you are considering going to the Whaler. First of all, I think the Whaler will be a very lovely place to stay once the construction is completed. It is a great location. I met several other owners who were so very kind and saw their units and some of them are very lovely. We plan to return...just not to Unit 805. I am writing this to help other people avoid a disaster on their vacation. I wish I would have had information like this when I booked. We rented through VRBO. I looked at several units and spoke with the owners. We decided on this unit as it was one unit back from the beach overlooking the courtyard and had the view of the island of Lanai on the ocean view side. Our contract arrived with the terms outlined and it had the Whaler Logo on the top of it. There was no mention at all of a parking fee. Three weeks prior to our arrival I was on TripAdvisor and saw an ad for The Whaler offering ""Construction Pricing"". I called the man we rented from and inquired about this and he said, ""They are just sealing some sidewalks on the side of the courtyard."" I asked if there were any noise issues and he said, ""No. I have one couple who just stayed there and they said that it really was no issue at all."" All I can say is that upon our arrival we were greeted with a major construction project! There were 3 Bobcats going and 4 concrete saws. The entire courtyard was being completly demolished. The noise level from our balcony (lanai) was deafening. I tried talking with the propery management company to see about getting our room moved to an outside room that did not overlook the courtyard, but they said they would have to charge me since I booked it through the owner. I showed them the contract that had the Whaler logo on it and they said that it was not a valid ""Whaler"" contract. Additionally, we were charged another $15 per day for parking...this was never mentioned in our conversations with the owner and it was not in the contract that we signed with him. I suppose we should have told him we were not going to pay it and made him pay it. I tried contacting him several times but he did not return my calls until the next day. You would think that an owner would call to make sure everything was OK...we are owners of a property and do so for our guests. But not this guy. He was hiding from us. When I finally got him on the phone I confronted him with all of this and he said, ""Yeah...the couple who stayed in it last week (the one he had refernced to me before) said it was pretty noisy and I asked him if I could do anything and he said I could send him some money back."" The owner lied to me in his earlier version of that conversation. Then he proceeded to tell me that when you are in Hawaii you don't want to sit in your unit anyway...you need to be going out early everyday. The audacity of him to dictate how I should spend my time. My husband and I both work very hard and don't get any down time with our daughter. The notion that we should jump out of bed everyday and be out of the condo by 8 am when all the drilling, hammering, bulldozing and sawing starts was....well....let's just say, an unwelcomed and unsolicited suggestion. Well, it might not have been so bad if the unit itself had been nice. It was filthy and smelled awful. In fact, the management sent someone over to check the airconditioner becuase the smell was so bad. The linens provided were all very old and ripped up. THe pillows were completely covered with yellow stains. I called his cleaning lady and insisted that she bring us new pillows, which she did. The carpet and walls were dirty. The bathrooms were dirty and the wallpaper was coming off the walls. THe showerheads were so corroded that my daughter would not shower in her bathroom at all. Again...I met some of the other owners and they showed me their units and some of them are really lovely. I would not suggest staying here until all the construction is complete. Then it would be a very nice place to stay. The units are very large as are the lanais. And like I said...the other owners I met were lovely. Just be extremely cautious when choosing a unit to rent. Ask for lots of pictures and references. Oh, and as for the owner...he kept telling me that he would ""make this right."" We had paid $325 per night for 7 nights. He sent me $200 back. After the parking it amounted to only $95. Gee thanks.",Oct 2008,July 2008,Traveled with family,,"St. Louis, Missouri"
20646839,50,The Whaler was nice,"My husband and I just returned from our first trip to Maui and our first visit to The Whaler for our third wedding anniversary. I knew about the construction but we weren't planning on staying in our room during the day, so we could care less about it. We got room 961 which faced the Westin...on our left was the ocean with a great view of the sunset, below us was the Whalers village with Leilani's and Hula Grill music playing in the evening with torches lit...and the sound of the ocean, to our left was the golf course and a view of the sunrise. What more can you ask for, except for the grumpy next door neighbors who seemed to never leave their room. The staff was friendly and helpful, Fred the baggage guy was very nice. We arrived to a basket of goodies, a fresh pineapple in our fridge, and a welcome card. The parking was a challenge the first night, but after that we generally always got a spot. The pool was closed, but next door was The Kaanapali...and i even got a quick swim at the Marriot which i highly recommend. Black Rock was great for snorkel...did a sunset cruise, Old Lahaina Luau...Hula grill and Leilani's great.

The Whaler is a poor choice if you are a delicate prince or princess. It is old and in need of a facelift but very clean and the employees are nice and helpful.  The construction noise will only affect you if you are in your room all day and not out enjoying yourself.  If you stay here, eat at the Hulla Grill; excellant food. Be sure and have the creme brulee for dessert.  Don't buy coffee at the Sir Wilfreds coffee shack at Whalers Village.

20086765,20,Stay away till after the construction is complete...,"This place has so many positive factors going for it that it's a shame that a few events contributed to an overall negative impression.    the negatives...  1)the construction is on from 8.30 till 4.30.. with jackhammering at times is deafening from lanai and a dull roar with the doors closed. it encompasses the ENTIRE courtyard which separates the 2 buildings.  2)the staff were generally indifferent to the guests and the manager was incredulous to any complaints. he kept me waiting for 30 mins hoping i'd leave, when i objected to not being informed about the closure of the swimming pool at the time of my booking.  3)the rooms are dated and need a major facelift. our's was something out of an austin powers film, with mirrors everywhere, even on the ceilings.    the positives...  1)location, location,location. right on kanaapali beach, next door to whaler village.  2)the apartments are HUGE, we had a 2 bedroom oceanfront apartment, the views were spectacular, and the sunsets magical.    i would definitely reccomend this place to stay after mid 2009 when the constuction is over.",Sep 2008,September 2008,Traveled with family,,"Sydney, Australia"
20049034,10,Staff & Mgmt doesn't care about you,"Maybe it's the construction, but the staff and management simply don't care about you. This was a repeat visit for me here, but they could care less. Here were my problems:    A) When I made the reservation, I asked for Tower I, Floors 9 - 12. Instead, I was assigned a 4th floor room in Tower II. They were able to change it to a 9th floor room, but still in Tower II. I asked again, and suddenly they were able to give me an 11th Floor room in Tower I - which was what I had requested in the first place!    B) The concierge overcharges. I asked about a discount I could have received by booking a snorkel trip on my own and was told they are given the same discount. I found out later I was overcharged $21. Not a huge amount of money, but it was how I was lied to directly to my face about details of the discount.    C) I tried cashing a check for $100, rather than paying ATM fees. They need to get verification from a 3rd party service. She tried for 15 minutes, but kept messing up the procedure! I finally grabbed the check from her hand and RAN to catch a bus I was trying to catch. I simply used an ATM later on.    The day I was checking out, I asked to see a manager, which brings up another concern...    D) It took 15 minutes for the manager to come out.    He only came out after I STERNLY requested to the front counter person a 3rd time I wanted to talk to him. The manager appeared to smirk as I mentioned to him the problems mentioned above, and the answer I got really only seemed to be that with the construction, it's been a very trying time at the resort. There's nothing he can do about the concierge as they use an outside service, and as for the staff member that couldn't handle the check cashing procedure - well, he blamed the company they use for cashing checks! The manager never once faulted his staff or representatives on their property for their errors on any issue.    Oh, the staff did seem concerned about us on one occasion - checking out! They called TWICE to see when we were planning on checking out! Gee...must be their way of saying ""Aloha"" to their guests!    So, in summary, the staff and management simply don't seem to care about the customers at this point. Their occupancy rate is well below 50%, and instead of trying to satisfy the ones that do come, they give them a hard time, don't try to accomodate their requests, and dismiss their concerns.    It's unfortunate as the room we had was wonderful with a great view of the ocean, the mountains, and nearby islands. But with no one caring about the guests, there's no way I can recommend to anyone to stay here (heck, I didn't even mention the construction issues!!!)",Sep 2008,September 2008,Traveled as a couple,,"Mullica Hill, New Jersey"

This time we spent several days going on side trips and discovered new areas of Maui. The construction stopped at 3PM daily so we still had several hours of beach time until the sunset.

We were informed by the front desk that the pool will be closed for the next 90 days and you can go to another resort if you want to use a swimming pool. There are signs on all the doors advising guests that it can get quite noisy during the weekdays with jackhammering, concrete sawing, etc.    I was wondering if we need a hard hat to get around the resort!    They advise guests to plan their excursions during the weekdays when the construction is going on. We have been coming to Maui for over 14 years (and have stayed at The Whaler condos 4 or 5 times) and we come here to relax and enjoy the pool and beach. We really don't venture too far from Kaanapali. If we would have known that all this was going on, we would have probably either planned our vacation at a later date or stayed elsewhere.    Not much we can do about it now except make the best of it although we are very disappointed. Just wanted you to know that the grounds are in complete disarray and it's like we're vacationing at a construction site.

Heed warnings of prior reviews...the construction there is awful - no landscaping, jackhammers and backhoes running all day - it's like Beirut on a bad day. Future visitors be forewarned - they are closing the pool in September. Maybe I'll go back one day once construction is complete, but I won't rent directly from an individual unit owner again. We weren't told about the construction prior to our trip (even though the owners KNEW we had stayed there many times and that we chose the units we did because of the great courtyard view, people watching and ""serenity""). I feel like I've been duped. If you do go between now and end of 2009, book through the Whaler itself. Occupancy seemed pretty low (gee, I wonder why?) and at least by going through them you have the option to change rooms to one of the outward facing sides vs. courtyard facing. We had no options but to deal with the deafening noise, dirt and ugly view. If you do get stuck there, go to the Barefoot Bar at Hula Grill and ask the bartenders for a Jackhammer (Amy's special drink with a dark rum floater). It takes the edge off!

You cannot sit on your lanai because the noise level is so high.

We were supposed to be at the Mahana up the road but they completely stuffed up out booking for 7 people and only booked one apartment. The Whaler is by far better. The beach is great whereas the other hotel's beach area was full of coral and you couldn't really swim there. Also much better placed, right next to Whaler Village and restaurants. Our condo's were okay nothing really flash but we had stayed at the Embassy Suites in Waikiki and they are very nice so you have to put it in perspective. Staff were all fantastic and they ladies on the sightseeing desk were well informed and great with recommendations. Had a great stay in Maui and would return to the Whaler again.

16474780,50,Maui Honeymoon,"We just spent 6 nights in Maui for our honeymoon. The top things we'd recommend are: snorkeling with Pride of Maui, Mama's Fish House, an Oceanside massage at the Four Seasons and a catamaran Sunset Sail. The shopping in Lahaina was very touristy but fun. We ended up buying a painting at gallery night as a remembrance. The store Maui Hands in Paia and Lahaina has some great pieces at affordable prices. Also, the Maui's own art and craft fair has some wonderful deals at low prices. The price tags at this craft fair were usually reduced by 40-50% when asked what the price was and dealers were willing to negotiate. We stayed on West Maui at The Whaler and it was a great location. Right on the beach. The pool always had chairs available as well. The location with the shopping center right next door and restaurants was awesome at Whaler's Village. We drove the road to Hana. Even though it was beautiful, I would take 2 days instead of one to do this. We started at 6 AM and made it to the seven sacred pools by 2:30 PM. The Twin Falls waterfalls was amazing. I would skip driving up to the Haleakala crater. Maybe we were just tired of driving, but we did this one morning, and definitely saw better sites on the road to Hana. Do the Road to Hana or the crater, not both. We will definitely return to Maui for another vacation...probably would stay in West Maui for a few nights and then in South Maui a few nights.

We have been to Maui seven times, and this was our first and last stay at the Whaler. Yes, the location is fabulous, but the hotel itself is in dire need of repair. The hallways need new carpet and paint. The grounds are just okay, with very stiff grass. The pool is old old old. AND you park your car on the tennis court.",May 2008,March 2008,Traveled as a couple,,"Hayden, Idaho"
16200351,40,"our condo was AWESOME (#602, Tower 1)","We shared a 2 bedroom/2 bath oceanfront condo with another couple. I always wondered if it was worth the extra money for oceanfront, but it absolutely is (at least for this property). Our lanai directly faced the ocean, and we had floor to ceiling sliding glass doors on the two outside walls of the condo.    I was a little nervous because it seems like a crapshoot when you book the Whaler since each unit is individually owned, but I can tell you that #602 in Tower 1 was worth every penny. We booked through Costco Travel so we didn't pay published rates.    I guess the only downside is the pool is not as good as I'm guessing pools at the hotel resorts are, and there was no poolside bar or anything, but the condo also felt more like ""home"" than a hotel does. I don't know that getting a condo would really be cost effective if it were just the two of us, but it is an excellent choice when traveling with other people, and we were all able to hang out in the living room as opposed to one couple's hotel room.    Kaanapali Beach itself is a very nice location.",May 2008,May 2008,Traveled with friends,,United States
16034681,40,Check for construction,"This was our fifth trip to the Whaler, but it may be our last. Our room was comfortably furnished, but the bed linens were textured and uncomfortable. There always seems to be some kind of construction at the Whaler when we visit- this year it was near the pool area. The wi fi set up was awful and didn't work even after I had paid for access. But the positives are strong- located on the beach, very well priced condo units, and great views from upper floors. I also noticed a greater security presence this year, preventing people from reserving pool lounges early in the morning etc.  Overall on this trip to Maui (Spring Break of 08) we felt that prices were really high and the value was not there. But we have friends on the island and love the atmosphere, so I'm sure we will return eventually.",May 2008,March 2008,Traveled as a couple,,"Kitty Hawk, North Carolina"
15734097,40,Loving life in unit #159,"We rented through Maui Beachfront Rentals and they were great. When ATA went under a mere two days before we were supposed to arrive we panicked; the condo was paid for and we had no way to get to it! Lesli at Maui Beachfront was so helpful and understanding, really cannot say what that meant to us! Ended up in Maui a week later than planned and could not have been happier with our room at The Whaler. All week long the praises rang for mom picking a winner! The unit is clean and well cared for, nothing fancy but great for the price. The best part of this unit is location! Our unit was ground floor on the side nearest Whalers Village. This was great for our kids, large grassy area and only 51 steps to the beach! This unit has a fantastic ocean view for a ground floor unit and with the grass area and bbqs so close it was like home immediately!We ate almost all our meals on the lanai, even dinner. It was nice at sunset each night as everyone seemed drawn to the beach.  We did go to Whalers Village alot, if you have kids there is a great toy store downstairs. Mostly went over to walk around or grab a shave ice in the afternoon. Are there nicer places to stay in Kaanapali? Sure but when you figure we payed about a third of what you pay for a one bedroom condo right on the beach it seemed like paradise. Take your kids to unit 159 and you will hear ""Mom no ka oi"" , Mom is the best!",May 2008,April 2008,,,Las Vegas
14899437,50,A Incredible Experience,I enjoyed it so much that I couldn't leave! So I extended my vacation two more days. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The ocean view was outstanding. I enjoyed the free entertainment and the conveniece of Whaler's Village. My room exceeded my expectations. I was on the 11th floor.Be sure to try the spa in Lahaina. I received the best massage that I have ever had. Enjoy!,Apr 2008,July 2007,,,Washington DC
14164270,50,Great Room & View,"My wife and I stayed in #964 (Tower-2) and we were well pleased with everything. The Lanai over looked the pool and ocean to the left and mountains on the right. We were buying a ""pig in a poke"" without knowing the room, view and etc. We asked for ocean view as high up as possible. The ninth floor was great. We had originally planned for another two couples to be with us but they cancelled. We then asked for a studio with ocean view on a high floor. You need to be above the trees to really enjoy the spectacular view. We saw plenty of whales and frequented the Hula Grill nearly nightly. We have stayed at other locations on Kaanapali Beach but plan a returned visit here next year. The Whaler on Kaanapali Beach in our opinion is a great choice. We were there from 02/24 thru 03/02/2008.  Tom & Marta  Monroe, MI",Mar 2008,February 2008,,,Monroe
14149233,40,Great Location,"We really were impressed with The Whaler on Kaanapali Beach. Our room was very clean along with the grounds which were well maintained. The parking garage was no big deal. If no spaces, the walk from the outdoor parking was very close to the condo. Again, no big deal. We stayed in a studio, 1216, top floor, Tower 1, with a fantastic view of the ocean, Black Rock and the hills (only thing wrong was the very hard bed!). We had all of the amenities of home, i.e. ample towels, appliances, dishes, etc. I agree with a previous review about next time we rent, it would be a one bedroom. One couldn't ask for a nicer beach. Loved the location as we walked to restaurants and an ABC store (similar to a White Hen but more) was next door offering beverages, food and a variety of other items. The studio had beach chairs available, however, if you wanted to rent lounge chairs for the beach it'll cost ya. $10 per chair, and $40 for two chairs together with a canapy for the day. $17/day for snorkle equipment.  Maui is such a wonderful place to visit.",Mar 2008,,,,"Chicago, Illinois"
14021145,20,hit or miss,"Ugh. This property’s condos are all individually owned, so the room you get is a crap shoot, unless you know exactly which unit you’re renting. We booked through a travel agent and lost the crap shoot. We checked in and got a dingy, musty, outdated room that had funny-looking carpeting. It was not really clean and just felt ewwww. It reminded me of a crappy motel 6. I wish I could remember which unit # it was, but I must have tried to block it from my memory. We promptly asked the front desk to switch us to a different room. They said none were available until the next day…I really didn’t sleep so well that night. The room we got the next day was unit # 664, much nicer, and we stayed 2 nights. It was a studio, VERY small, barely big enough for the two of us when the Murphy bed was down. In fact it was smaller than the previous room, but ya know what—it wasn’t scuzzy, and that’s what really mattered! The full kitchen was handy for saving a few $$ on meals. We stocked up at the Safeway grocery store (they also take Dominick’s cards). The ""ocean view"" meant a view of the other tower, and you could see the ocean if you’re on the lanai and look to the left. It was ok, but not as nice as an ocean front unit would have been.  The rest of the property is unimpressive. They have some nice landscaping and a koi pond between their two towers, but that’s about it. There’s construction noise from some work that they’re doing to their parking garage—which you can’t park in due to falling concrete. All the parking is down the hill in converted tennis courts. The spots are narrow and tight and it’s a pretty far walk when you’re lugging suitcases. Laundry is available in a little room near the elevators, one washer and one dryer per floor. The machines take only quarters, there’s no change machine, you have to go to the front desk. And you must provide your own soap/fabric softener as there is none available for purchase there. Their fitness room is woefully inadequate for a property this size. It’s tiny, it has very few cardio machines, even fewer free weights, and there is no free space to do mat work. If this is important to you, stay somewhere else.  All in all I’d say this property has seen better days. It’s in a good location by Whaler’s Village and the price is right for those on budget. Just don’t expect too much, and try to book directly with the owner of a nice unit so you don’t get blindsided like we did.",Mar 2008,January 2008,,,"Chicago, Illinois"
13900559,40,Unit #759 Tower II,"We arrived at The Whaler's on February 6th, 2008 and stayed until February 28th, 2008. After staying at the Sheraton Maui several times, we decided to book a condo for its' kitchen and extra space. We booked through a Maui Vacation Specialist, so we had seen many pictures of each of the units we were considering, and chose this one for it's sofa sleeper in the living room as we had our teenaged son with us. We didn't feel we needed a whole extra bedroom for him, and he loved having the big screen TV all to himself after we went to bed.    The unit was large and airy, with high ceilings and lots of room. We had one bedroom that was very large, one bathroom with the toilet and shower closed off for privacy, a full, extremely well equipped kitchen, and a wonderful LR and DR. We faced south and had 180 degree views of the ocean, sunset over the island of Lanai, and beautiful mountain views. The furnishings were perfect; rattan with pineapple motifs on the upholstery. There was a 52"" TV, DVD, CD and wireless (free) internet in the LR. The bedroom had a king sized bed, large TV, DVD and CD player. The closets are HUGE, and with all the furniture having cabinets or drawers, storage was definitely not a problem. The kitchen had all the large appliances as well as an iced tea maker, coffee maker, hand mixer, salad spinner, Cuisinart, coffee grinder, frozen yogurt maker, rice cooker/vegetable steamer, can opener, toaster oven, blender and toaster (that was totally destroyed). The furniture was very comfortable and the king sized bed had a pillow top on the mattress. There were an abundance of games and books in the LR cabinets, mirrored walls throughout the unit, and lots of beach accessories--chairs, boogie board, umbrellas, coolers, etc. There was even a huge supply of plasticware for taking food or drink to the pool. The entry and kitchen floors are tiled, the bathroom is faux marble.    Now, for the cons: Hot water took a long time, and at peak times, we didn't have any at all. Our ice maker flooded the kitchen until we called maintenance (who responded immediately), and the tile floor on the lanai got very hot from the sun. Our carpets were so filthy, our bare feet turned black. There was vomit on our bed blanket, but fortunately, there were several extra blankets in the hall storage closet. There is no washer or dryer in the unit, but there is a pay laundry ($1.25 washer/$1.00 dryer) on each floor. Even though the owners say this unit was completely remodelled in 2002, tennants have been very hard on it. The white kitchen Formica has knife cuts all over it, wallpaper is peeling, there are a couple of large holes in the drywall, the trim on the kitchen cabinets is gone, and the unit needs painting. The aluminum screen doors to the lanai kept coming off the track, and never really closed properly.    But the biggest drawback was the NOISE. Our unit overlooked Whaler's Village, and the noise from the refrigeration trucks early in the morning supplying the Hula Grill and the Rusty Harpoon was horrible; the backing up beeping from delivery trucks, clanging of sliverware, smoke and fumes from the Hula Grill and constant construction noise from the Whaler's was deafening. Many days our unit filled with wafting smoke from the oven ducts on the roof of the Hula Grill, and the stench of fetid cooking grease was unbearable at times. When you can hear the beautiful sounds of waves breaking on the surf, you don't want it drowned out by loud city-like noises or closed lanai doors.    The pool was small and rectangular, not particularly kid friendly like the mega pools at the Sheraton or the Marriott, but more than adequate for adults. Seating around it was very good, and the pool attendants were extremely helpful (as was all the hotel staff), and the beach was wonderful.    One of the nicer things were the outdoor grills. There are three granite picnic tables and three gas grills for each tower. They were very busy, and it was a nice touch to be able to grill.    All in all, even though the Whaler's is older, it is more than adequate, and depending on each owner's decor and remodelling, you can either get a hit or a miss. Do your homework. If you can, write the owner and ask for more pictures than you see online. Ask when the unit was last updated. And, look for reviews here. Everyone sees things differently, so one person's dirty carpet, is of no issue to another. Just do your homework and rent from either an owner or a reputable vacation rental site that can be a liason between the owner and you. DO NOT rent from ResortQuest, as you will not know what unit you'll be getting until you check in. ResortQuest is like the front desk of a hotel complex. You get what they have, sight unseen.",Feb 2008,February 2008,Traveled with family,,"Divide, Colorado"
13763662,50,Home Away from Home,"Upon arriving at The Whaler we were a little nervous because there was construction going on and a lot of barricades. When I got to the lobby I was greeted by a very personable attendant. Originally we booked a one bedroom but had two kids so I asked for a roll away or if they might have a two bedroom. The gentleman went to ask and said they would put us in a two bedroom, no upgrade charge. When we got to the room it looked a little outdated but as we entered the room it was very clean and HUGE. We had a 180 view with 5 sliding glass doors and a lanai that gave us a view of everything. We stayed in room 1173 and the only thing that could have made it better was a lower level and the room needs to be upgraded. The kids got their own bedroom with their own queen size bed and their own bathroom. My husband and I got our own Master Suite which was fabulous and very large. It was paradise and the staff were always super friendly. The view of the mountains, the ocean and even Whaler's Village was wonderful and entertaining.

And, because we were celebrating an anniversary, they left us an anniversary card as well. It was a fantastic condo located on the 11th Floor with a wrap around lanai. Our view was spectacular. We couldn't have stayed in a better condo and having The Whalers Village located next door was a big plus.

Although it has taken 10 months to write a review, we still think about this ""fabulous"" condo and our wonderful experience. We are now planning our next trip to Maui and I realized another day could not pass without sharing our great experience.    We have been to Hawaii over a dozen times , but this trip was the first time we booked a condo directly with the owners. After reading TripAdvisor and our prior knowledge, we knew that the Whaler was ""the"" perfect place to stay. We were a bit apprehensive booking directly with owners because of our lack of experience and reviews posted by other travelers.    I searched Google for ""Whaler Maui Condo"", and found the perfect condo and owners. Janell could not be more delightful! The Condo was immaculate and gorgeous! Everything was better than expected. Janell even called shortly after we arrived to see if there was anything else that we needed.    The condo is newly remodeled contempory and is stunning. Although,we spent most of our time on the very large wrap around lanai. We were so mesmerized by the view of the ocean and whales, that we rarely left the lanai.

13159301,20,Be careful of your room assignment,"We celebrated a late 30th anniversary by staying at the Whaler from Jan 23 to 28, 2008. This was our 1st visit to Maui, and we expected a little better for what we paid.    Strengths of the Whaler: (1) central location to the beach and water activities, (2) studio rooms with kitchenettes, (3) very responsive maintenance and housekeeping staff, (4) beautiful blue-tiled linai, (5) pretty flowers on the linais, (6) washers and driers on each floor, and (7) right next to the Whaler Village with shops & restaurants.    Weaknesses: (1) the incessant beeping from construction equipment on the southeast side of Tower # 2, (2) small ants in the kitchen, (3) on-going basement garage repairs, (4) and some rooms below the 6th floor on the southeastern side of Tower # 2 have limited views of the ocean, like maybe 30to 60 degrees.    The bottom line in my opinion regarding the Whaler is that the views from the various rooms range from 5-star (oceanfront, above the 6th floor or outside of Tower 1 overlooking Black Rock) down to 2-star views. I felt we got a 3-star view on the 5th floor of the southeastern side of Tower 2; however, the constant beeping of construction equipment made it feel like 2-star lodging. Fortunately, trees obscured the rooftops of shops in the Whaler's Village, and we had greater privacy and more of a natural view with some of the ocean visible from our linai. We asked for a room on a higher floor, and were offered a 9th floor room on the inside of Tower 2. The insides of both towers face each other, and there's a significant loss of privacy. We kept the 5th floor room, kept our privacy, but had to live with the incessant beeping of construction equipment. Got some relief on Sat. & Sun. when there was no construction. Therefore, I would definitely inspect the view from a room, and make sure there was no audible construction noise nearby before paying for any room.",Jan 2008,January 2008,Traveled as a couple,,us
13096790,50,Best Spot on Maui,"We stayed at the Whaler on our honeymoon. We had a room on the 11th floor in Tower 2. The room was huge and spacious and nicely furnished with a kitchen, bathroom and dressing room. The lanai (balcony) was huge with amazing views over the beach. We got a room which had all day sun and it was beautiful to sit and watch the sunset from our balcony. I would recommend asking for a room high up to be able to enjoy the view.    We had the best spot of beach on the whole of Kaanapaali Beach. The beach out front was beautiful soft golden sand and not overcrowded. It was an easy walk to Black Rock (outside the Sheraton hotel) which has the best diving and scuba spot straight off the beach. We saw heaps of little tropical fish and even sea turtles.

12990054,50,Will Certainly Return to #315 at The Whaler,"We found a nice place on Kaanapali Beach on Maui from VRBO. That site is great. You get pictures and descriptions of places for rent by the owners. When I compared the prices, it was a way better deal through the owners than calling the hotels direct. We ended up choosing a studio, unit 315 at The Whaler Resort on Kaanapali Beach. It was perfect. The place had just been remodeled with top notch everything and the coolest mosaic picture in the shower. They made a huge double size shower that my wife fell in love with. All of their furniture and tile floors and carpet was new and everything was clean. The bed was king size and we slept like babies. We really liked the idea that this complex had full kitchens in all the units since eating out in Maui gets pretty expensive if you have eat out all the time. The kitchen had nice granite counters and new cabinets and appliances. All the pans and eating/cooking utensils were there and we did not need anything extra. We really enjoyed getting steaks at the Costco on our way out of the airport in Kahului and cooking them on the gas grills they have by the pool. We had fun talking with the other people who were visiting and sharing places and things to do there. The balcony, they say lanai, was really nice too. There was a table, higher than normal, and two high style chairs with a chaise lounge. The table height was perfect and we could sit and not have the balcony rails obstruct our view. We spent a lot of time out there for our meals. You could see the pool and ocean/beach and watch the sunsets every night. They have a fish pond and the gardens were very pretty with all kinds of tropical flowers. We visited the gym they downstairs one day to just see it, but did not work out. Who wants to work that hard in Maui? It was decked out for a good workout though. Tennis courts looked nice but we did not play. There was a big flat screen tv on the wall that you could angle in any direction and they had a big selection of movies. There was also a stereo with lots of music cds including some really authentic island type music. They also had a nice feature with the elevators that went right down to the parking garage. The unit was very close to the elevators so we appreciated that. They had grocery carts in the garage to put all your stuff in so single trips were all that was needed. The best part though is the path that goes all the way down Kaanapali beach. There are tons of restaurants and things to see and do. They give surf lessons and parasail rides from the beach. We ate at Hula restaurant and it was very good with live music outside. We went down to the Marriot hotel and had maitais at their really nice pool area. The snorkeling was also a blast. Black Rock at the end of the path was the place to go. We saw sea turtles that did not seem to mind us at all. It got a little crowded at that end with everyone wanting to snorkel in the same area but was still really worth it. The drive over to Hana was interesting and scenic. My wife got a little scared at the skinny roads and it was hard to get past cars coming from the opposite direction. Worth a one-time drive though. Great picture areas on the whole dirve. We ended up going all the way around the island from Hana. It turned into a dirt road but you got to view the really dry, almost eerie side of the volcano. Other than that I could really recommend unit 315 at Whaler Resort. We are already looking for a date to go back. Oh, they also had a really generous and very thoughtful welcome basket for us when we got there. There was a bottle of sparkling apple cider with lots of chocolate covered macadamia nuts, a photo album, cards with stamps and even a mousepad with the view off the balcony on it. We were very impressed. A couple we talked with by the bbq area said they got a pineapple so we felt very special with our basket stuff.

12621574,30,Overpriced,"Just got back January 14th, really disappointed with the place. Room had a musty smell to it, and it needed to be updated. I personally didn't think it was worth the money for what we paid.    Didn't think the maid service did a very good job at all cleaning, turned off the refrigerator on us when we still had food in it.    I guess we should have complained about the room and gotten another one, that is what most people seem to be doing.    Overall I wouldn't say I had a terrible time, I just think my stay was average and would pick a resort next time.

12617848,40,Comfortable but without flair,"I wasn't looking for the Ritz and I wasn't pining for the Marriott, so my expectations for The Whaler were spot on and I liked it very much! Units are owned by separate owners, managers, etc... so I was a bit nervous booking blindly and knowing it could be hit or miss. We took advice from other reviews and requested a higher level room, which we did get! The unit was clean and warm, and faced towards black rock, which I found to be a pleasant surprise. I loved the mini kitchen to prepare my own food, coffee, cocktails and snacks. I enjoyed immensely relaxing on the lanai in the morning with my breakfast, charging up for the day. The grounds were clean and well kept. YES, this is an older building and the grounds and towers could use a face lift, but it was certainly not in terrible shape. I found it to be a very comfortable place to stay. It is an extremely convenient location and I enjoyed being next to the Whaler's Village and adjacent restaurants. I didn't mind the very short drive to Lahaina and other locations on the island.    If there is anything to complain about I'd say it is the parking situation. It seems the garage has been under construction for a very long time and we found that to be quite frustrating. There is an adjacent lot that you can gain access to, but it is not nearly as convenient. I found the parking situation to be an irritating inconvenience but by no means is it a deal breaker.    Note: If you enjoy snorkeling, I HIGHLY suggest that you take the time to snorkel around black rock. I have never seen so many sea turtles in my life, and the other wildlife was beautiful below the surface. I could spend hours swimming around over there!

12454675,20,Would not recommend staying here.,"I would not recommend staying here, I'm sure there are better choices.    The Whaler is old and in need of updating and has very average pool and grounds. We had a 2 bedroom condo on the 5th floor in Tower 2 which had an ocean view if you looked to your right but our main view were the rooftops of restaurants and shops at The Whalers Village. The worst part was the noise of the refrigeration truck that came every morning from 8:00 to 10:00, extremely noisy, to supply the restaurants. We had to shut the door to the deck and miss out on the sound of the waves. We asked for a room change after 2 days and they gave us a condo on the 11th floor of Tower 2 which was furnished much nicer and had a great view of the ocean. Problem was that they started construction and repairs in the courtyard between the two towers right below our unit. Bad luck! One of the 3 elevators was not working for the 10 days we were in that building and other people told me it had not been working for a week before that. There were problems with one of the other elevators as well. I will say that the 2 bedroom 2 bath units are very roomy. The gym is in the basement with no windows and is very small.    If you decide to give it a try anyway do not go through Resort Quest, you can get a better rate by going on VRBO.com. and renting directly from an owner. I did ask for a discount because of the noise from the construction and the inconvenience of the broken elevators. They did take $300.00 off our bill, a drop in the bucket as the rates are quite high. I prefer the Weilea area in Southern Maui.",Jan 2008,December 2007,,,"Arvada, Colorado"

Liked the price and figured we'd survive if it wasn't perfect. We ended up loving our trip. It was a perfect location for lounging by the beach, shopping, and lots of great food. We never had to rent a car or try to find a taxi except for to and from the airport. We had a first floor with a patio, which was surrounded by hedges which gave privacy but still let us sit outside and listen to the waves. It was beautiful and the concierge services were great.

12354665,30,Unit 1170 - Whaler onKaanapali Beach,"This is our sixth visit to Maui. On this trip we stayed at the Whaler on Ka'anapali Beach. Following are some details and recommendations for staying at this condo.    The Whaler complex was built in 1976 and it is definitely showing signs of its age. There are two buildings - Tower I and Tower II. Both are two very basic, concrete rectangular buildings with 12 stories each. There is a basic lawn and garden area in between the two buildings, and a small pool and one spa tub.    For your best experience, I highly recommend you get a unit in Tower I facing the interior of the complex (south side of the building). These are units ending in 1-23; e.g., 1123. This side gets the direct sun exposure, with views of the sunrise and sunsets. You'll also be able to look at the pool and shared grounds from your private lanai. The south side of Tower II will also get sun exposure; however, they are overlooking The Whaler Village shopping mall and the back side of several restaurants. These are units ending in 51-73.    We stayed in Tower II on the north side, unit 1170. These are units ending in numbers 52-74. We rented our unit directly from the owners. Our unit was tastefully decorated and clean. It had a washer/dryer, free Internet access, and was well-stocked with kitchen supplies and spices, etc. for cooking. As mentioned above, our unit is on the north side, so it never gets any direct sun whatsoever. But it does have beautiful beach, ocean and mountain views. We could also see Black Rock and Molakai island. Overall our unit was very nice. Nevertheless, we spent most of our time on the beach and outdoors.    Food is VERY expensive here on the islands. Therefore, if you are staying at least a week, we recommend that you make a stop at Costco in Kahului (very close to the airport). If you don't have a Costco membership there is a Safeway grocery store just a few miles from the Whaler condos.    If you want to lounge by the pool, you'll need to get a space reserved before the sun rises. There are only about 45 lounge chairs for the entire complex. Unfortunately, people place their towels and cheap personal property (suntan lotion, magazine, etc.) to keep their chair reserved for the entire day.    Be warned that the underground parking garage and main entrance were under construction. These are in between the two towers. Therefore, note that there is construction noise (jack hammers, saws and machinery) from 8:00 - 5:00 weekly if you are staying in units that face the interior of the complex. Confirm with the owner and/or front desk to inquire on the construction schedule and completion date.    Overall, this is a nice complex that we'd rate as 2.5-3 stars. It's clean and the staff are friendly. The primary draw-back is the very small pool area. It's entirely too small for a larger complex. However, you can lounge by a pool at any hotel. This is Hawaii, so enjoy the gorgeous sandy beach and truly warm water!",Jan 2008,January 2008,Traveled as a couple,,Seattle
11918372,40,Room 1265 Tower two The Whaler Kaanapali,"It was my husbands and my first trip to Hawaii (both in our twenties). After looking at the hotel prices around Kaanapali we found VRBO. Boy are we glad we did. For the price we got for a 12th floor room on the beach we were skeptical coming in. We walked into the room and were pleasantly surprised. It was perfect for two people. The kitchen was great for breakfast’s and lunches – who wants to be at restaurants their entire vacation? There were plenty of towels to last us the ten days. Most importantly, the bed was comfortable after a long day. And the best part of course were the views off the lanai. To our left were the mountains and daily rainbows, and to our right was the ocean, beach, and the island of Lanai. The only down side were the smells/noises from the Hula grill below…but again, it was 12 floors down. So it was bearable. And of course the room wasn’t updated and didn’t have all the services hotels have, but we could care less about that. It served the purpose and was fairly clean (some green stuff around the bathtub drain).  The elevators came quickly, but even if they didn’t we wouldn’t have minded because there was an open air hall and you could look down at the pool and ocean while you waited. The pool was small, but we never found it too crowded to find a chair or take a dip if it was too windy at the beach (sand would sting). The staff that provided towels were also very friendly. The beach was beautiful white sand and swimming was nice as well. It was a little steep getting in, but leveled off after that. You could snorkel right in front of the Whaler or take a three minute walk down the beach to Black Rock to snorkel. I have snorkeled in Bermuda, Aruba, Key West….and Black Rock was by far the best we’ve seen, even better then taking the boat trips out into ship wrecks, etc. Bring your gear!    Food:  Unfortunately about an hour after we arrived at the island we had a bad experience. We went to the grocery store (Safeway) down the road to stock up on breakfast and snacks. At the register we did not have a store card. At home if you don’t have a card the clerk has one behind the counter and scans it for you. Well, this clerk must have smelt tourist from a mile away because he refused to scan a card and wouldn’t even let the woman behind us share hers. He proceeded to crush every item of ours as it went down the belt. Bread, cookies, chips…all smashed. We were so shocked we just left with our broken food. Just be warned, some locals are bitter about tourists and will be very rude. Fortunately that was our only bad experience, but b/c it was the first hour we were there it didn’t start the trip off right.  Other than grocery’s (expensive, but not as bad as eating out every meal), we went to several restaurants around. The Hula Grill at the Whalers Village was very good. Fish and Poi in Napali was excellent – a little drive up the road but worth it. Cheeseburger in Paradise in Lahaina was also good at night, live music and ocean views of the cruise ships. I would also recommend getting reservations for the Old Lahaina Luau one night.  Giovanni’s at the top of the road was Not good. They had feral cats climbing on the tables -the waiters did nothing about it. They also had awful service and brought us the wrong food as well as the three tables around us.    Things to do:  We took a day trip to Oahu. Went to Pearl Harbor, hiked Diamond Head crater, and went to Waikiki beach. Fares on Hawaiian Air were reasonable. I would definitely suggest it if you can. A lot of people said go to Kauai as well. We didn’t get a chance.  In Maui, do the road to Hana. Wake up early, because it is a full day if you make all the stops. We went on a Sunday to avoid local traffic and because a lot of people are traveling on Sundays and we had no traffic problems. For a mile marker guide I just used this link: [--] and was happy with what we saw. I would skip the Arboretum ($10pp and can see so many things for free just as beautiful). The red sand beach was tricky, but worth it. Park on the Uakea road, then go through what looks like a schools back yard to find a path. Wainapanapa State Park was also worth a stop. It has a gorgeous black sand beach, blow holes, and lava flow tubes to explore – also a bathroom stop.  One morning when the weather is suppose to be good I’d suggest going to a Sunrise at Haleakala crater. Beautiful views of the island – bring very warm cloths! It went from 80 degrees at the bottom to 40 at the top(10k feet up).  We went to the Maui aquarium for a couple hours. It was ok. Probably better if you have kids?  Shopping in Lahaina was also a good time. There were lots of people from all over the world there.    Over all we had a great time at the Whaler and in Maui. I hope we make it back there some day! Enjoy your trip.",Dec 2007,October 2007,Traveled as a couple,,"Boston, MA"
11902172,40,Enjoyed the Whaler,"Stayed at the Whaler 12/03 thru 12/13 2007. We stayed in unit #1151 renting directly from the owner. It was a one bedroom two bathroom unit. it had two lanais or one big wrap around. Beautiful views of Black rock and of the mountains. You could see Lanai and Molokai and we saw several whales from our lanai. The kitchen was updated with marble countertops and was very well stocked for cooking. The bed was very comfortable and the furnishings were well cared for and attractive. There was everything you could ask for, beach chairs, coolers, beach mats and toys. The front desk staff were friendly and helpful. Check-in was smooth. The lobby entrance and drive are being updated/repaired so it was a little difficult to unload and get in the front but not a big deal. The property IS older but seems to be pretty well cared for. They are working on the parking garage to fix the crumbling concrete and flooding issues. It did rain lots and yes, the garage gets flooded. We parked over on the overflow lots several times, once to avoid the water. The pool is clean, and there are lots of chairs. My one complaint with the pool is they need to not let people save their loungers when they don't use them for hours. We stayed mostly on the beach so it wasn't a big problem. The shopping and restaurants next door make this hotel a great place to be. So convienent. We enjoyed our stay here and would stay here again.",Dec 2007,December 2007,Traveled as a couple,,
10862574,40,Best Location in Maui,"My husband and I stayed at the Whaler Nov. 17 thru 27th 2006. This was the best vacation we have ever had! The Whaler is so convenient to everything and the beach is breath-taking. The rooms need a little TLC, but it did not change our over-all experience at all. The staff is very friendly and the rooms are very large. I especially loved the lanai, the view of the ocean, etc.. was incredible.",Nov 2007,November 2006,Traveled as a couple,,"Olney, Maryland"
10808516,40,Loved the Whaler,"We stayed at the Whaler in room 514 of tower two, (a studio with an ocean view). We loved the room, the condo building and the beach in front. The room had a full kitchen (separated with a breakfast bar) big bath and shower area, a large area near the door to hang clothes and stow snorkel gear and a safe, large living area with table and 4 chairs, a king size bed, large couch and TV area too. The balcony (or lanai as it's called in Hawaii) had a nice view of the ocean (not a full on ocean view) but from the table on the balcony you see a large portion of the ocean and part of the island of Molokai. The balcony table and chairs were all high so the view was not obstructed by the railing. We read in the comment book in the room, that during whale season, people can see whales from the balcony while having coffee. The bed was comfortable but more on the softer side (each room is furnished by the owners so a different room may have had a firmer bed). The oven had a few issues but the stove top worked fine as did the rest of the kitchen appliances. Parking in the parking garage was never a problem and we always found space. The room did show it's age in a few areas but not in an icky way. We were very comfortable in the room and felt it was quite spacious. The beach area was plenty big for setting up chairs in the sun, the pool area was small. One warning for families with smaller children, the beach is very steep and the waves crash right at the edge of the water and within a few feet you are in water that's well over 6 ft deep. I never touched bottom and couldn't begin to guess how deep it was. I would have been afraid to let young children play in the ocean here. Further up the beach, (10 min walk) by the Sheraton and black rock, the ocean was a bit more kid friendly. All the beaches are public even in front of hotels and the Sheraton will rent chairs and umbrellas and cabanas even if you aren't a hotel guest. The snorkeling at black rock was awesome - you can see sea turtles and tons of fish.",Nov 2007,November 2007,Traveled as a couple,,"Colorado Springs, Colorado"
10801090,40,"Great views, nice beach, good value","The Whaler is a condominium facility that also rents rooms, and the rates are very reasonable for this area, you are right between two beautiful hotels that charge 20-30% more for the same view, and same beach access. Of course the Sheraton is 4-star with super fancy decor, but the Whaler is at least 3-stars, the service is excellent, housekeeping was good, the room was clean and had EXCEPTIONAL views of both the oceans and mountains. The beach area is pristine, it was a very nice stay, good kitchen facilities and amenities.    Pluses:  Great views, very reasonable, next to good restaurants and shopping, on a beautiful beach, access to good snorkeling, clean, outstanding spa treatments. Front desk staff was very friendly and helpful.    Negatives:  Towel service is lame, especially is at is at a sunglasses stand with a guy constantly trying to sell you stuff. Waves were rough and high this week, but that was supposedly unusual. Pool is marginal, definitely for old ladies and the sunning crowd, not so great for kids. The nearby hotels had far nicer pool areas if you have little kids. We forgot to tip the cleaning staff one day and came back to a messier room than usual. Parking garage is nasty, if it rains you can look forward to walking through puddles even though it is underground.    Summary: If you can deal with bad parking, an average pool, and annoying towel services (also facilities are totally smoke free), the views are totally worth the price, the in room kitchen facilities are modern, and the spa is really good.",Nov 2007,November 2007,Traveled with family,,Des Moines
10694625,40,Great experience at the Whaler 661,"My husband and I recently stayed at the Whaler unit 661 on Ka'anapali beach for our wedding. We enjoyed it very much! Booking through the owners definitely saves a lot of money and allows you to look at pictures of the specific unit.    Thoughts on our unit:    Pros:  - LOCATION! (amazing price considering its smack in the middle of Ka'anapali beach, right next to Whaler's village with shops and restaurants)  - View (has a wonderful view on the lanai)  - Very clean (didn't see any bugs, etc)  - Bed (very comfortable)  - Fabluous BBQ areas (we never had trouble getting them, no reservations, alcohol allowed)  - Full kitchen and huge walk in closet  - Unit is stocked with plenty of towels, fan, ironing board, extra tp, etc. (there is also a safe)    Possible Cons (depending on your needs / preferences):  - Not luxury (if you're looking for granite countertops and stainless steel, look elsewhere)  - No washer / dryer in unit, though there is one for the floor  - Kitchen supplies are all there, but not high quality (dull knives, etc)    Many of my family members stayed at the Ka'anapali Ali, which was much more luxurious than the Whaler, but we felt very at home in our unit. The staff were all very helpful and kind.    The parking garage really wasn't bad (it was all open when we were there in 10/07) and they provide shopping carts at the elevators in case you're bringing in a large load to your unit - very convenient!    Snorkeling at Black Rock was incredible, but go early b/c it gets busy by 9am.    Fees were not as high as I expected from renting through owner: $50 resort fee first day and $5 each remaining day and $12/day for parking (can come and go).",Nov 2007,October 2007,,,BostonKim
10138106,50,The Whaler was Perfect,"My Husband and I stayed at The Whaler for our Honeymoon from Sept 17-24, 2007. It was just wonderful! I booked through Costco who used Resort Quest. I paid close attention to the reviews here on Trip Advisor and made sure to request an updated room on an upper level. And they gave us just that! We stayed in 1261. The view was amazing, the beach is beautiful, and it's very close to the Whaler Village. It was perfect for us because we didn't want to stay at a hotel with tons of people everywhere. It was very quiet and private. No one bothers you at all. And having a kitchen is great because eatting every meal out can get tiresome and expensive.  As for the room it was really nice. Clean and comfortable. We had a studio with a king bed and it was good size. I loved the central air that comes on automatically when you close the Lanai doors. Smart idea.  The Lanai itself is spacious and beautiful. I wish I was back right now, drinking coffee and relaxing. ahhhh.  So, if you are looking for an above average place to enjoy beautiful Maui for a reasonable price this is it!  PS I know a bunch of people have complained about the parking garage but really it was fine.  Aloha! Have a great time. It is a really gorgeous and fun place.",Oct 2007,September 2007,Traveled as a couple,,NJ
10072702,50,The Whaler was perfect!,"My wife and I just got back from a week at The Whaler and it was great! We booked a great room directly from Ted, the owner, (---)  so we didn't get a complimentary pineapple. We did get a much better price, though! Saved enough money to buy 2 pineapples.  The room was great. If you want to feel like you live at the beach, stay here. If you want to feel like you're in a hotel for a little while, stay somewhere else.  I think The Whaler has the best beach as well. Farther South it becomes rocky and farther north it becomes crowded. Although black rock was fun to jump off. And being literally right next door to the Whaler's Village was amazingly convenient.  From reading the other reviews I guess room quality varies, so if you rent direct, try to check out the reviews first.

8654032,40,Our Whaler Trip,"My husband and I spent 10 days at The Whaler hotel. I had based my choice using the comments on this site. The location was amazing (no doubt about that) and being so close to The Whaler Village was very very convenient. The staff was kind, the complimentary wine and pineapple was nice, and the cleaning staff was considerate and polite. We stood in an ocean-view room and we were close to the restaurants(There was no harsh scent; the smell of BBQ a little but usually in the evening) I have to say that the rooms need a make-over, the bathroom was all marble (but turning yellow) the wall-paper was pink and peeling off , the ceiling had some moth balls building up(that was pretty gross, considering there is daily cleaning and you pay good money for these rooms) It was a great trip mostly because we were in Hawaii and it was just very very romantic being there, but if I had to choose to come back to this place or recommend it to someone, I would suggest to stay in a more modern hotel. The pool was very average. The best part of it was the view-hands down. Kaanapali beach is beautiful and long, there are many many hotels along the way and I would choose another if I had to choose all over again (since it costs the same amount). There is no complimentary breakfast, there is 1 washer/dryer on every floor ($2.50 total for 1 load) This place is great if you are not concerned with being in a more modern/up to date place during your stay. Also, we were suprised with a bil of $108.00 for parking there everyday, so make sure to set aside $12.00 a day for parking.",Sep 2007,August 2007,Traveled as a couple,,Southern California

8519005,30,It is what it is,"As my husband says, the Whaler ""is what it is"". The unit we had (#859, on the 8th floor of Tower 2, facing south -- see pictures) was spacious enough. The furnishings were not our taste, but they were comfortable (even the sleep sofa). Our view was lovely from the decks which spanned both the living room and bedroom. The housekeeping staff was very pleasant (my daughter slept in every day and they kept stopping me in the hall to ask when they could straighten up). The kitchen is adequate, even if you wanted to make meals. The bathroom is a little dated. The grounds are just OK, especially in comparison to other nearby hotels. The pool is small, but for me, a perfect temperature (some people thought it was too warm to be refreshing, but I loved it) in a perfect location right next to the beach. It could, however, use some ""modernization"". Chaise lounges were reasonably plentiful and the beach hut people were very nice. Be aware there are no drinks or food sold at the pool, but you can bring your own. We loved the location right next to Whaler's Village (shopping and eating), and being right in the middle of Kaanapali Beach, so you can walk to the Sheraton at one end to snorkel at Black Rock, and the Hyatt at the other end for a drink, or just for the walk. In fact, we ate lunch at the pool at the Marriott a couple of times.    Others have mentioned the parking. It didn't bother us, but since half the underground parking lot is closed for repair, we did have to park a 2-minute walk away in an outdoor lot.    You should know that not every unit has WIFi internet access.    It's not what I would call ""upscale"" (we had just come from the Marriott Waiohai which is quite a bit better maintained (and newer)than the Whaler).

We golfed at Kaanapali, Maui Lani and Wailea. The Emerald course in Wailea is by far the best. Good value. Kapalua is extreemely expensive and Wailea is by far a nicer course.    Parking at the whaler is not ideal, but we usually found underground parking. Stop at costco or Safeway on the way and load up on snacks and drinks to be used while at the condo.

8472138,50,"Great stay, great location!","My family and I first stayed at The Whaler in the summer of 2005. We had such a great stay. The room was a gorgeous ocean front suite on the second floor. We had a wrap around lanai over looking the pool and courtyard and just about 20 feet away from the beach. Now the room decor depends on who actually owns the room but I did take a little tour of a few of the rooms when we got there and they are all range from nice and comfortable to absolutely gorgeous.    The hotel is located on the best beach in Maui (Kaanapali beach). And the hotel is right next to Whaler's Village which is a convenient little open air shopping center. Now don't go to the Rusty Anchor for dinner. Lunch is okay and so is breakfast. They do have two happy hours and do make good drinks. Right across the way is Leilani's (sp?) Great great great! There is also a food court in the Village and an ABC store which is great to grab things like milk or snacks.    Oh, and keep in mind the hotel itself doesn't have a restaurant or anything (like most of the condo hotels) so being next to Whaler's Village is great. But do make a trip to Vons or something cause you have a full kitchen in the room (which is always helpful when you're on a budget!)    The hotel is just a short walk to Black Rock which is perfect to go snorkeling. Rent your gear in the Whaler's village and do it for the week (or more). It's like $25 and it's so worth it. Swimming with sea turtles is an amazing experience. And the fish and coral are so vibrant. A lot of fun.    We enjoyed our stay at The Whaler so much we went again this last January ('07).

8464792,30,Great & Convenient Location!,"I came to the Whaler on August 14th. The Whaler is a convenient location in Kaanapali beach. It is right next to Whaler's Village, which is in walking distance of the hotel. It has tons of great shops and a couple of fun restaurants. There is so much to do (beach activities, fine shopping, restaurants, beach bars) within walking distance from the Whaler. There is also a laundry room in the hotel. The description of the hotel says ocean view rooms but my room, unit 961 only had a partial view of the ocean. So the view wasn't that terrific either. The room had a dish washer; iron with ironing board, stove, refrigerator and a couple of beach chairs that were already in the room that you can take on the beach with you if preferred. That would probably be preferable considering the expense of the rental chairs and cabanas on the beach. The cabanas went as high as $40.00 for the whole day until 5:00. There was also a guest book in the hotel for visitors to sign and write about who they were and why they came to Maui. In our refrigerator, there was a fresh cut pineapple waiting for us, compliments of The Whaler.    I found the hotel to be clean and quiet. The only complaint I had was that housekeeping didn’t clean our room after our first night. After a complaint, the room was cleaned. The hotel desk staff was very accommodating and tried to keep us happy. They weren’t as friendly as other hotel desk clerks that I’ve encountered, but again, they did their best to please us.    The Whaler has a long stretch of beautiful beaches. I can’t understand why everyone was cramped by the pool when there was a beautiful beach that was so warm and inviting! In my opinion, the pool wasn’t that big and had way too many adults and kids in it.    There weren’t any bars or restaurants on premise but as I spoke of earlier, they’re right next door in the Whaler Village, it’s walking distance. I would definitely come back to Maui and stay in Kaanapali, there is so much to do and see for everyone. Do venture out and explore all the different beaches.

8394739,20,Room 770 tower 2,"We booked two rooms and stayed at the Whaler last year in Tower I and had a fabulous stay. The rooms were clean and fresh and the room journal had entries from many other satisfied renters.  When we made reservations this year, we assumed all the rooms were this way...big mistake. Room 770 was dirty looking (Carpet was discolored) and smelled dank and mildewy, as did the entire hall, but less so. It took a day to ""acclimate"" to the smell, and so long as the AC was full blast, it kept it at bay. The smell was characteristic of washing clothes and then forgetting about it in the washer for a day or two. All your clothes smelled of this when you left the room.    The next huge problem was the elevator...it was located directly behind the headboard of the bed. All day long and through most of the night it sounded as if a grocery cart was being rolled up and down the wall. I would assume all the rooms on each floor located adjacent to the elevator had this problem, but when I brought it up to the manager she acted as if this were the first time it was ever brought up. This noise and vibration is way too loud to act as if nobody else has ever mentioned it. She acted surprised. We were there for 6 nights and it never relented.    The last problem was the mysterious bites we would wake up with. They didnt look like mosquito bites and we didnt have them before we went to sleep. They itch like crazy and look like little dots...not raised like a mosquito. I got mine mostly on my belly and butt...kinda odd to get bit through clothing.    Overall, we still managed to have a great time in Maui...we love kaanapali and would even recommend staying at the Whaler. Just dont be naive like us and assume all rooms are the same.

Dr. Fall was very gracious and returned our cleaning deposit promptly. We met other people at the Whaler and they were very unhappy with their units. The problem is some units were very dated but unit #1252 was very updated.

8276255,50,"Good value, great location, great staff...","We stayed at the Whaler the last week of July, 2007. We had booked an oceanview studio (we are a family of three, two adults and one small child), but after we checked in and saw the studio I realized that I would really want more space to enjoy my vacation. Also, the studio looked out over the hotel next door, and it did have a view of the ocean, but only if you looked sideways off the balcony.    The front desk was very accommodating, and gave me the keys to a couple of empty units so I could check them out before I upgraded. We ended up upgrading to a beautiful 1 br/2 bath unit on the 11th floor, that had just be upgraded and had a wonderful view. We did have to pay a little more, but that's only fair. This particular unit was really wonderful, very new and clean. We stayed there a few nights, then had to move to a different unit because the first unit was booked at the end of our stay. The second unit (a 1 br unit overlooking Whaler's Village) was also very nice, but much older than the first unit (but it was also cheaper).    A word about placement: The first unit was in tower 1, with a view of Black Rock. This tower and view is much quieter than the unit in tower 2, which overlooked Whaler's village. In the unit overlooking Whaler's village we could smell the cooking from the Hula Grill, and heard music from below (we were on the 11th floor too), sometimes from 3 in the afternoon to 9 at night. For a few nights that was fun as kind of atmospheric (and it was Hawaiian music, so that was great too), but it started to bug me after a while. If you are sensitive to ambient noise, just be aware of this. We tended to keep the doors shut so the condo didn't end up smelling like food. On the other hand, we did have some really nice dinners on the balcony under the full moon, listening to the music below.    My little one really enjoyed the pool, which seems quite warm for a condo pool. I've stayed at a few condos in Kaanapali, and this one has the warmest pool I've experienced - the sea was 78 degrees, and the pool was warmer than that.    The front desk staff were very accommodating about finding us a condo that we liked. They did everything they did to make us happy. When we moved rooms, the staff moved our bags and all of our food for us, while we went out sightseeing. We didn't really need to do anything (except pack bags).    These units are all privately owned, so they are all in a slightly different state of upgrade. My recommendation is that if you don't like what you have when you check in, ask the front desk to help you. Even in the high season, they tend to have different rooms they can offer up.",Jul 2007,July 2007,,,"Santa Cruz, Ca"
8255140,40,Awsome Place!,"We stayed at The Whaler July 16th through the 20th. What a great place! We had booked through our travel agent, and the studio sized condo we stayed in (Tower 1, #718) was nicely appointed with a very comfortable king sized bed. There was a guest book left by the owners, welcoming you to their home, and inviting you to leave them a message. With it being a condo, we were able to at least eat breakfast in the room each day, which is a savings. There was even a pre-sliced pineapple left the in the refrigerator as a welcoming gift. The beach is just beautiful, we spent a couple of days just sitting at the beach. The surf was rather strong during our stay, but the water was warm and just as clear and blue as a swimming pool. The view from the beach is of two of the other islands. We saw rainbows every day we were there. We didn’t have a lot of interaction with the staff, but they were polite and helpful when we did. I would absolutely stay there again.",Jul 2007,July 2007,Traveled as a couple,,Rochester NY
8251463,20,Not worth the money,"We had a bad experience here. We booked our trip through the management company Resortquest. We originally were booked into a oceanfront room on the 10th floor, it was a beautiful room, gorgeous, unfortunately the smell from the restaurants below were so horrendous that we were forced to stay inside for 3 nights, I then asked to be moved and was moved to a oceanfront room above the pool that was NOISEY and the room was in terrible shape except for the kitchen - which we didn't use. The bathrooms had old urine stains around the toilets. It was a very expensive mistake. The beach is beautiful This was just like Nags Head for 3K which is really sad. Black Rock is down by the Sheraton unfortunately this beach is so overbuilt that the water is starting to become cloudy from overuse (suntan lotion etc). In all my travels I have never seen so many people use a pool (that is falling apart) when there is a beautiful beach right outside their door. There were many many cigarette butts on the beach. The condo/hotel is falling apart - the garage is 50% closed due to falling concrete - the garage is under the facility. Our first unit - 1013 had a deck that sloped and from looking at it from the road it is certainly leaning. I would avoid this unit - unless you can tolerate the constant and never ending smell of 3 restaurants below your window, there is NO clear air smell. Amy at the front desk was nice. If I ever go to Maul again I would avoid this place and the whole kaanpoli beach area and look for something quieter, if you want Nags Head, then spend half the money and go there. It's very expensive - we spent 3K just on the condo. I was extremely disappointed in teh Whaler, it really needs to be torn down and redone, it really is falling apart. We drove around Maui and there are quieter places, in better shape to the south. We spent 4 days on the big Island a 7 in Maul and I would head to the big Island before going to this island and this hotel/condo.",Jul 2007,July 2007,Traveled with family,,"Portland, Maine"
8106255,50,"Whaler, Unit #661 - Great Value!","The condo was GREAT! It’s a studio with a beautiful canopy bed and full kitchen. The view of the ocean was also great. They had everything that you will need to cook (pots, pans, coffee pot, glasses, plates, silverware, etc.) plus extra toilet paper, paper towels, all sizes of bath towels, a fan, iron and ironing board, books, tv, vcr, dvd player. I loved that there was a kitchen, it saved so much money. I don’t know how people can afford to go to Maui and eat out all of the time. There are also onsite laundry facilities if needed; we didn’t use them although we thought we may have to because we almost ran out of towels.    One of the best things about the condo is it’s proximity to the beach! The condo is right on Ka’anapali Beach (one of the best) and it’s a short walk to Black Rock (very good snorkeling). The pool is pretty small but who goes to Maui for a pool? Beach towels are available when you go to the beach or pool.    Note: this unit (661) was not booked directly through the Whaler property; it was booked through an owner directly from Hawaiian Luxury Condominiums [--] - . Because of this we had to pay an additional resort fee which really wasn’t that expensive ($50 first day, $5 a day after). We paid $199 a night and I noticed at the front desk that the room we got was going for $255-$330 depending on what they classified #661 as (ocean or garden). There is a mandatory $12 parking fee for all guests and I am pretty sure that no matter where you stay on Maui a parking fee will be added on somehow. The only negative about the property, and this has nothing to do with the unit itself, is the parking garage. They've closed some of it for renovations, so there aren't enough spaces and we ended up parking in the overflow lot several times. Not really a huge deal, but it was the only negative.",Jul 2007,June 2007,Traveled as a couple,,"Jacksonville, Florida"
8052512,40,Great beach. Nice view from Lani,"Great beach for swimming (calm water) and wonderful snorkeling just walking distance to black rock. My husband and I stayed at the whaler in unit #251. It was an ok room but what was great was the view...ocean front. Amazing sunsets and the smell of the restaurant next door was fabulous. We booked this room through vrbo (vacation rental by owner) so we knew which room we would have. Our friends were very disappointed in their studio unit so be careful how you book.    Book an excursion! The best one we booked was the snuba dive adventure to Molokini on ""The Pride of Maui"" a large boat (did not get sea sick) that serves a hot lunch...hamburger, chicken burger, veggie burger. If you go rent the 5 mp underwater camera. It was worth it. Also do the Old Lahina Luau.

8036834,50,Great Place with Great Customer Service,"Great place to stay. Stayed for 3 nights. Checked in with no problem but room was not ready until 4pm. The bell man held our luggage for us at the front desk. We spent the day at the beach which unfortunately was very windy and the sand was whipping around. When we were finally able to check in to our room we found the accommodations to be very nice. The room was very big and had everything you would need to make your stay a pleasure including books to read at the beach and a huge lanai with great views.The room was very clean and neat. The room comfortably slept 4 adults. During our stay there was a brush fire in Olowalu. We were unable to get back to The Whaler for one night due to road closures. We ended up getting another hotel room in Kihei for the night. The general manager at the Whaler, Loren Shim, was extremely accommodating and understanding. After speaking with the woman at the front desk regarding our situation, Mr. Shim called us directly within minutes to see how he could assist us. Mr. Shim offered us a discount for the amount that we payed at the other hotel. We felt this was very generous and shows great customer service. We are happy to recommend this hotel to others and highly encourage others to try it out.",Jul 2007,June 2007,Traveled with friends,,"Oahu, HI"
8034340,40,Whaler was perfect!,"My husband & I booked a ground floor studio, #114, directly from the owner on [--]. Upon check in they gave us the rate sheet for our oceanview room, and it was double what we paid.    The studio was perfect for two people, though I know it could accomodate more. Every day, we made our morning coffee and sat out on the patio , looking at the ocean, watching the morning walkers and runners go by. Though we were there in what is considered a busy season, it never seemed crowded. For the most part, Ka'anapali shuts down at about 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. Most of the late night partyers seem to go to the restaurants aned bars on Front St. in Lahaina. The Lahaina Grille and Store is a perfect place for a good meal and to watch the sunset from the rooftop restaurant.    We took the bike ride tour down Haleakala and would highly recommend it. It's 38 miles, almost all downhill, and takes about 2.5 hours but you see Maui from over 10,000 ft elevation.    We also took the Ocean Riders tour around Lana'i, stopping to snorkel along the way. We had spinner dolphins so close to the boat, you could almost reach out and touch them. Incredible!    The Whaler is directly next door to the Whaler Village shops and restaurants, and they have the usual ABC store for your basic supplies. Everything in Maui is overpriced, but it's to be expected and wasn't a big deal.    The Rusty Harpoon serves a great breakfast at a reasonable price with a great view.    I highly recommend the Whaler and Unit #114. Check out VRBO.COM/65092.",Jun 2007,June 2007,Traveled as a couple,,"Orange County, CA"
7937756,40,Great View,"Just spen 2 nights at the Whaler. We had 2 rooms. One studio and a one bedroom. Check in was ok, front desk was not that overly freindly. We arrived at 1:30 and could not check in till 4. The location is fantastic, you are right on the beach. We stayed in room 456 and it was refurbished and in excellent condition. Only complaint about the room was the pull out bed. Was very uncomfortable and my sister ended up taking the mattress and putting it on the floor. You have a private access to Whaler Village via a key. Security is fantastic, you cant get anywhere in the building without using a key card. The underground parking was ok. There seem to be some areas with falling concrete but does not seem nearly as bad as I have read in other reviews. And they have protected those areas. The pool is great right on the beach but also in need of some repair, tile has fallen off all around the upper cove base. The pool guys were very friendly and helpful. Towels were always available as were lounges. You can rent the beach lounges with the little hoodies for 15 a day and well worth it if you plan on staying on the beach all day. Nice way to get only as much sun as you want. We had a wonderful view of black rock. The grounds are immaculate and well kept. Would definelty stay here again.",Jun 2007,June 2007,Traveled with family,,California
7841359,50,Loved the Whaler,"We stayed at The Whaler from May 5, 2007 to May 15, 2007. We had a fantastic holiday. We brought our two girls 6 &4 yrs old for their first trip to Maui. We had a blast. My husband's first time to Maui. The Whaler was a perfect place for our family to stay. We were in room #219 a one bedroom. We had a partial view of the ocean and great view of the grounds. I am glad we weren't too high off the ground with young kids and it made it a quick trip to the pool and beach. Our room was newly renovated with granite counter tops in the bathroom and kitchen. Stainless steel appliances in the kitchen and all the utencils necessary. There was a double pull out bed in the living room and a twin bed in a secret alcove area in the bathroom with another tv. The kids loved that space. We found the room service to be great. Fresh towels everyday.    The pool was a big hit with the kids. We were there daily. It's nothing fancy, but very clean and lots of loungers to chose from. You get a new towel with each visit to the pool as well. The beach is just steps away. Very handy.    Loved having the Whaler's Village next door and so many great shops and restaurants to choose from. Lahaina town only a 10 min drive where there is a lot of great shops and more great restaurants. Saw a few great sunsets in Lahaina Town.    We plan on staying at The Whaler again.",Jun 2007,May 2007,Traveled with family,,British Columbia
7840376,30,Great Beach!,"Stayed May 24 to May 29 2007. Booked last Nov via ResortQuest. Called a few times to make sure we were given an upgraded room. Read reviews of some of the old rooms that were not upgraded. We were assured that we would have an upgraded room and they even gave us a room #. This was a few days before arrival. When we arrived they put us in an entirely different condo...not upgraded. #452 is very dated, the air conditioner did not work properly, the couch was smashed and the pull out look as if a steam roller ran it over. Generally needed paint. After reviewing my notes on what unit we were suppose to get, I called the front desk. They advised me that the owner of the other unit had decided to come in and we were out. I was also advised that you get what you get and that it was not their policy to give out room numbers in advance. They were all booked and had no other condo to give us. They gave us a roll away at no charge that was sufficient for my teenage son to sleep on. They also refunded part of the cost of the room. We were really upset, but feel that they did their best to fix the problem. The beds ended up being comfortable and of course the oceanfront view was great. The pool is old and not very large, but the ocean is steps away and perfect for swimming. No rocks. The Whaler was located perfectly for ease of shopping and resturants. I would consider staying again, but would make sure of the condo # and condition ahead of time.",Jun 2007,May 2007,Traveled with family,,"Ventura, CA"
7819525,40,Best Stay Ever,This hotel was the best choice that we could have made. Our room was huge. We had a 900 square foot hotel room with 2 full bathrooms. Having 2 full bathrooms is huge when trying to get ready and go out to eat after a day on the beach. Oh ya the beach is located 5 foot steps from the hotel. This could not have been a better location. Also the balcony of our room was huge and overlooked the ocean. You have to stay at this hotel if you want great location and a huge NICE hotel room. Also this hotel is within close walking distacnce to all the shops and restaruants. We were turned onto this hotel by friends and figured we should share the great experience.,Jun 2007,June 2006,Traveled as a couple,,california
7754004,50,Wonderful Whaler,"We recently spent 4 wonderful days at The Whaler. We were in studio #914 in tower one, which gave us a lovely view of Black Rock and the breathtaking scenery behind the complex as well. This was overlooking the roof of the Kaanapali Beach Hotel but as this is a lower rise building and we were on the 9th floor, was not a problem for us. We had a renovated kitchen and bathroom and everything looked clean and quite new. It had aircon and a really comfy king bed. Another great feature was a superb block out screen which we could operate at the push of a button.    We found all the staff to be helpful and friendly. Because we booked through an agency we had a daily housekeeping service and the room safe was included in the rates. The only additional charge we had was $12 per day for parking which we were expecting anyway. As a previous reviewer has stated, under cover parking got a little tight coming back at night but we just parked in the outside car park still on the grounds of the complex.    When we booked with Royal Hawaii Condos we requested a high level, renovated unit with good ocean views, so be sure to request this when booking. We were lucky enough to also have views of Black Rock.    The Whaler is in a prime location on the beach with an easy access path leading right to Whalers Village shopping center and local restaurants. There is also a BBQ area and nice manicured grounds. I liked the pool area and it was very refreshing to spend some time at the beach and then shower and finish off with a dip in the pool. The surf was too rough for me so the pool was a great alternative.    There are a variety of restaurants a couple of minutes walk away. I would recommend going into Lahaina for a better meal though as we didn’t go much on the two restaurants we went to nearby with average meals and small servings which annoyed my husband. Definitely try BJ’s Chicago Pizzeria in Lahaina. The best pizza we have ever had and plenty of it.    There is a beautiful golf course behind the hotel strip if you like golf and there are tennis courts at The Whaler you can hire if your passion is tennis. Also if you drive a little further along the main highway instead of taking the left turnoff for the hotel, there is another shopping center. This may offer more options for purchasing food items as Whalers Village, though a nice shopping center, only seemed to have an ABC shop for basic food items. We found the ABC shop sufficient for what we needed though.    To sum up we’ll definitely be staying at The Whaler again if we can get back to Maui one day. We absolutely loved it.",Jun 2007,May 2007,Traveled as a couple,,"Sydney, Australia"
7583530,50,"Wonderful vacation at The Whaler, #1063","We stayed at The Whaler the last week in April. We booked a studio unit ( #1063) through VRBO. The owner was great to deal with and I can't say enough wonderful things about the unit, as well as the overall property.    The unit was stocked with everything we could ever need. There were beach chairs, a cooler, binoculars, Bose CD player, books on Hawaii/Maui, fully stocked kitchen (with full sized fridge, dishwasher, blender, etc.), Q-tips, cotton balls, soap, sewing kit, etc., etc. Basically anything we needed was there in the unit.    Even though it was a studio, there was plenty of room. It had a king-sized bed, dining table, couch, coffee table and bar stools. There was a table and chair set, as well as a chaise lounge, on the lanai. Which brings me to the best part of the unit--the view! It is on the 10th floor with an amazing view of the ocean as well as the mountains. We saw rainbows every day from the lanai. We also enjoyed the music that would drift up from the Hula Grill below. It was a great view for whale-watching and people-watching since you can see Whaler's Village, the restaurants and the beach all in one glimpse.    The property was overall a great place as well. Yes, the pool is rather small, but there always seemed to be plenty of chairs and they would let you move them up to the grassy area overlooking the beach. The exercise room was really nice--two treadmills, three ellipticals, 2 bikes, etc. The staff at reception was very nice, as well as at the pool.    We enjoyed our stay so much that we have already booked the same unit for next year.",May 2007,April 2007,Traveled as a couple,,"Tempe, Arizona"
7555965,50,Excellent stay in #1116,"The Whaler room 1116.    Summary. Excellent room. Excellent location. Helpful staff. Older building, but upkeep appeared to be quite good.    Pros. My wife and I spent 5 days in late April at the Whaler. (We made reservations in January through Priceline.) The condition of the room was excellent. We had a studio that overlooked the beach and Black Rock. The studio had a complete kitchen and utensils were included. The refrigerator had two bottles of water and a sliced pineapple waiting for us. The Whaler is a 3 minute walk from Whaler Village. The shopping center has everything from a Louis Vuitton store to Borders Express. The ABC store there is good for groceries and souvenirs. The restaurants we ate at there were very good. The Rusty Harpoon has breakfast we found especially good.    The Maui Bus leaves from the east side of the shopping center. The stop is hard to miss because it is next to the skeleton of a large whale. (A whaling museum is also in the shopping center. Admission to the museum is free.) The bus left for Lahaina every hour and cost $1 a person. The bus took about 10 minutes to get the Cannery Wharf Shopping Center, which has a Safeway and Longs Drugstore, and about 10 minutes more to get the wharf center.    For snorklers, we found that snorkel rental at The Whaler, at $7 an hour, was cheaper than renting the gear at the Sheraton, $8 an hour. The Sheraton is at Black Rock making it very convenient.    Cons. Very few. We didn't find a muffin pan with the kitchen utensils. The pool was a bit small compared to other hotels along the beach. The concierge was usually very busy. We often had to wait a while before being able to talk to her. (Wish the Maui Bus ran back from Lahaina later but The Whaler has no control over that.)    Hints. We ended up with $200 of dining gift certificates and a $125 gift certificate at Hilo Hatties, a Hawaiian gifts store, for attending two timeshare presentations. Lahaina has lots of excellent places, including a Ruth Chris, to eat. $200 buys several very nice meals.",May 2007,April 2007,Traveled as a couple,,"redlands,ca"
7548923,40,Whaler 119,"We booked this 1br suite through the owner via VRBO. It's a ground level suite, which we wanted because we have a 15 month old and thought he'd like having the yard out front. Turned out the grass is a very course prickly variety so it wasn't great for playing on, but the quick access to the beach and pool was good.    We had a bit of trouble at first because the room wasn't ready for us at check-in time - the private cleaning service the owner used hadn't shown up. But when we got in touch with the owner she sorted it out very quickly. And when we discovered the coffee maker was broken, the owner had it replaced the same day.    Most of the front desk staff was also helpful, although one person was rude and dismissive since we weren't staying in a suite handled by the main management group. That's a fair point but she could have been gentler about making it.    The suite was great, very comfortable, very clean, and spacious. We could unpack everything and still have plenty of storage space. The ceilings are very high for a ground floor unit. The kitchen was remodelled and very well supplied; we could have had a bake off in there if we were inclined. The living room had a huge wrap-around sofa which was very comfortable and also great for socializing (we had other family members staying in another suite at the Whaler and our living room was the gathering place). The bathroom decor could use an update and the king bed in the bedroom is two twin beds put together, but those were small negatives in a suite we were overall very happy with. There was lots of beach equipment available to use; chairs, beach umbrella, sand toys for kids etc.    The Whaler pool was nothing fancy but fine for a dip. It was never overcrowded while we were there. Always plenty of lounge chairs available. Towels provided for beach and pool.    The Whaler grounds are nice. I was surprised at how quiet and peaceful the property was given its prime location on Kaanapali beach. Having the Whaler's Village shopping center next door, and snorkling at Black Rock a stroll down the beach, was very convenient.",May 2007,May 2007,Traveled with family,,Japan
7492381,30,Studio 461,"My husband and I stayed at the Whaler for 8 nights in April. We were in a studio suite which was recently reno'd. The studio met our needs however we would prefer a 1BR next time. The closet space is small for suitcases and then clothing and also to put in used laundry. This studio is supplied with bare necessities only. There are linens and towels to accomodate 3 people however if 3 were there it would not be enough. Only 6 towels and no towel change daily as we booked through Monte Fits Realty. It is private and therefore you do not have access to daily maid service or anything associated with the Whaler or Aston hotels. ie I forgot my hairdryer and that is not supplied in unit and not accessible as we were renting thru private rental agency. There are no plastic mugs or cups to take to pool so bring your own. If you wanted to cook you would have to bring all your own materials as there is nothing in the cupboards. There is not even a coffee filter supplied if you forget to pick any up or bring your own. We have been in many condo rentals and in comparison this one has the very bare minmal in the way of supplies. Most supply coffee filters, foil etc and you replace what you use. Just a thot for the owner. Same with the towels, could use few more if no change is given till 9th night. It is a nice clean unit and the King Murphy bed is comfortable.    The restaurants around the area are reasonable and even more so during happy hrs and early dinner specials. The Kaanapali Beach hotel has a breakfast buffet however it is 15.95 and that is costly for fruit and toast/pancakes only. There is a super little restaurant in the Kaanapali Villas north of the Whaler about 10 min walk and it is called the Castaway cafe. It is reasonable and huge portion breaky for less than 10.00. If you want a reasonable breaky to serve yourself then do the BEachwalk cafe in the Marriott Ocean club. It is pretty good for selfserve and free refills of coffee if you use the same cup. There are many little bargains along the beachwalk and you pay for location and view.  The location is perfect beside Whaler's village and also in middle of the beachwalk to go either direction. The pool is on the small side and can be busy with families and the upper deck is nice for a quieter space. The grounds are nice and well kept.    There is computer access in the business center however it is costly and very slow speed. Mexico has them beat with high speed and cheap internet. It is not at the Whaler which is sad considering this is a new business centre. There are faster computers in other hotels on the strip or even in the little coffee kiosk at the Whaler's village. All in all the weather was awesome during our stay and we certainly enjoyed the location. We would go there again perhaps in larger suite and higher floor for view. there is a safe in the little storage closet and there are books there to read as well. That was handy to exchange with.    We did the motorcoach tour by Valley Iles to Hana. It was well worth it. We did it on a Sunday which is a great day with less traffic and our driver was Barry. He was awesome and very informative and we learnt much about the area that we would never have known if we had driven ourselves. There are only 12 people on the bus and it is nice trip. Long day but the time passes quickly as we were kept busy seeing all there is to see there and back. There is lots to do and see if you want to cut into your tanning on the beach. It is worth walking the shops in Lahaina and taking in a dinner from one of the restaurant decks and taking in the sunset. Very pretty. We are looking forward to our next trip.

7476407,50,Virtually Perfect in every way!,"We stayed at the Whaler #270 during the spring break week around Easter. While we got off to a bumpy start, everything smoothed out quickly and we ended up absolutely loving our 11 day stay there, and we were sorry and not ready to go when it was finally time to leave.    We arrived on a Friday afternoon, around 2:30PM. The front desk personnel are very much ""on Hawaii time"" and went about their tasks quite casually. After waiting for our turn, we did the usual paperwork, then were told that checkin time wasn't until 4PM and we could not get our room assignment until then. We were a little disappointed, but we went down to the beach, came back at 4, ad got our keys.    Our first room had some problems. The front desk quickly took care of that and assigned us to another room. It too had a minor issue with the door lock and air conditioner (which were very quickly fixed by the efficient maintenance people). However, we were very pleased in every other way with the room: the decor was fresh and friendly, it had been cleaned meticulously, and appeared to be in every way a well-maintained unit. Each of the 2 rooms was equipped with a flat-panel TV, DVD player, and VCR; the kitchen was well-stocked with utensils and so forth. A security safe was available for our valuables.    We loved staying in our ""condo by the beach"". The main room had a kitchenette, dining table for 4-5 people, and a sitting area with an L-shaped couch which doubles as a foldout bed. The other bedroom (a hotel-room style ""lockoff"" which was opened up to make it a suite) was nicely furnished with a very comfortable bed, dressers, and its own bathroom -- very nice! The rooms are very well sound-proofed, to the point where TV watching in one room is virtually undiscernable in the adjoining room.    The Whaler is in a marvelous location, perhaps the best-situated property on Kaanapali beach. To the south, you have the Whaler Village shopping complex (literally right next door), with 3 fine restaurants, many shops, ice cream, a convenience store, all within a 3 minute walk from the condo towers. Further on are other hotels, including the Westin, Marriott, and Hyatt. To the north, you'll find the Kaanapali Beach Hotel and the Sheraton. This means you have many opportunities for dining and shopping all within strolling distance along the beach ""boardwalk"" as the locals call it (a little sidewalk that runs along the beachfront up and down the strand).    This property was delightful to us. We had two other families meet us there, and the eight of us enjoyed many happy days on the beach, going to the luau at the Hyatt, dining at the Hula Grille right next door, or barbequing right there on the Whaler property, on one of the 5 gas grilles all setup with granite countertops and picnic tables!    I don't golf but there's plenty of golfing right across the street, again just a quick stroll or jog.    There's a full service beauty salon and health spa in the basement of the north tower. The fitness center and sauna are both recently redone, freshly equipped with ample equipment, and appeared well-maintained, clean, and safe.    I highly recommend this place for anyone who want to spend time having fun in the sun, mostly hanging out at the pool, swimming in the ocean, snorkeling, playing tennis, or golfing.",Apr 2007,April 2007,Traveled with family,,"Santa Cruz, CA"

7218389,30,Musty,"We arranged our stay through the VRBO website and thought we knew enough about the unit through the photos that were attached. For location, Kaanapali can't be beat and the weather was also in our favour. Our only complaint was the musty cigarette smell throughout the condo, so it's something to ask about when you reserve. Book advice: Mile by Mile a NO, it's only good for a portion of Maui and is very cheaply rendered. Not what we expected at all. The Frommer's Maui was far more complete and easier to follow. The Tedechi Winery was worthwhile and the so was our bicycle ride down from the top of Haleakala.",Mar 2007,February 2007,,,Monrovia
6726536,50,first time in Maui and we loved it!,"We (mum, dad and 13 yo son) stayed at The Whaler at Kaanapali Beach from 7-13th Jan 2007. What a fantastic stay. Maui is soo beautiful! We rented Condo 114 directly from the owner via VRBO and it was exactly as described. We liked being on the ground floor as we didn't have to travel in the lift, just step straight out onto our lanai and off to the beach. We had a good partial ocean view (some places would call this an ocean view I think) and it was heaps cheaper than directly thru resort too. We were actually advised to stay here from a posting on tripadvisor - thanks for that. It was right next to the whaler shopping village so very convenient to the restaurants and for buying milk, bread, beer, wine etc from the ABC store. As I have read in some reviews parking was limited downstairs but there was also an outdoor parking area so it wasn't a problem.    We ate a Rusty Harpoon (only OK) but the happy hour cocktails were great! We also ate at Lei Lei's both upstairs and down and both were very nice. The shrimp and scallop satay sticks at the upstairs restaurant were out of this world! We didn't eat at Hula Grill cause they always wanted us to wait 20-40 mins and, being Australians, we do not like to wait! ( We did eat at their Waikiki beach restaurant but we were rushed through our entire meal - very disappointing).    While there we spent a day in Lahaina, we had lunch at the Bubba Gump Shrimp Factory Restaurant - delicious and a great atmosphere. In the afternoon we took the submarine ride, very good but perhaps not worth the money if you've seen a reef before, then took a sunset dinner criuse aboard the spirit of laihana - dinner included fish, shrimp and steak (all 3 not just a choice of one) salads etc and we all enjoyed our meal. Afterwards a bit of hula dancing on deck to finish off the evening. Since I booked they changed the policy of unlimited drinks to only 2 per person plus the welcome onboard cocktail but as the cups were very big this was enough (even for us thirsty Ozzies!).    We took the road to hana, what a trip! Don't miss it if you can help it, we saw lots of beautiful flowing waterfalls along the way and had great fun climbing down trails, under bridges and ""rock skipping"" to get the best views for our pics. I was glad we had hired a 4WD cause the roads were a bit ""hairy"" at times. We bought the book called Maui Mile by Mile - a fantastic guide. Others who had Maui Revealed were following us down these trails etc saying they would never have found them if it wasn't for following us! So as not to be rushed we stayed in Hana for the night at the Hana Bay Charters in the Waikaloa suite - just brilliant - large, clean, private and although across the road from the bay still a good ocean view. We got take-out from the ranch restaurant at the Hana Hotel and also had breakfast there - not a buffet but a good selection to choose from their menu. I would definitely recommend staying the night cause we didn't leave Kaanapali till 9am (instead of the recommended 7am), packed a picnic lunch and spent about an hour at the one of the stops along the way with picnic tables and also did a 1mile hike. We arrived at Hana around 5pm and once again didn't have to rush the next morning, a leisurely breakfast then onto the Gulch of Oheo - an amazing place - make sure you leave plenty of time to hike here cause depending on how far you want to go it can take hours but some very rewarding views along the way. Again, we packed a picnic lunch and stopped at ""the black sand beach"" for lunch on our way back. Since the earthquake you can no longer go around the other side, you have to go back the way you came. Even so, it took us till around 4pm to arrive back at The Whaler. I guess if it wasn't winter time the water flows may not have been as spectacular as they were.    My husband and son are avid surfers and found a great break at Flemings Beach that wasn't too big (around 5-6 ft) and only 5 mins drive from the Whaler.    Overall, a great time was had by all and I hope this review may help some of you thinking of going there.",Jan 2007,,,,"Sydney, Australia"
6717007,50,This is a great place!,"We stayed here a couple of weeks ago. We were in 1101 on the corner, it couldn't be any better than this. The lania went all the way around from the ocean side to the courtyard side. Our condo was in great shape and had everything you could think of in it. This place is right on the best beach in Maui and next door to Whalers Village shopping mall with places to eat as well as nightlife. Black rock was just down the way and has great snorkeling. There was good snorkeling right in front of the place.We didn't even use our car for a couple of days! I can't find anything negative to say about this place, I've been all over the different islands(Maui twice, once in the Maui Kai) and can say this was the best experience I have had.",Jan 2007,January 2007,Traveled with family,,"Las Vegas, Nevada"
6561292,50,Maui Max,"My family has stayed in Maui several times over the last several years. We have stayed at the Whaler the last 3 times. I have found the building to be very clean and right on the beach in the middle of everything. The prices are very reasonable especially compared to the Sheraton, where we have stayed twice before. If you are looking for an overpriced hotel with underrated service then try the Sheraton. However if you want a virtual bargain that leaves you much more cash to spend on other immenities then stay at the Whaler.  The grounds are small but neatly kept. This resort does not have the frills of the others but if you really need that you can always walk the 3/4 mile sidewalk on Kaanapali Beach and check out all the other hotels where the guests are spending 2 or 3 times what you are.  I highly recommend the Whaler to anyone who comes to Maui.",Jan 2007,September 2006,Traveled as a couple,,"Mt.Zion, Illinois"
6472938,20,Whaler #764,"The Whaler at Ka'anapali Beach is an excellent property with exquisitely kept grounds in possibly the best location on all of Maui. Located directly on the beach, it has all the amenities one would want for a vacation in paradise. Before booking a condo there, however, find out as much about the specific unit that you can.    We stayed in Unit #764, a studio condo suitable for a couple. The Whaler was built in the mid '70's and many of the units have been updated or upgraded, but this one has not. It appears to still have the original stove, although the refrigerator, microwave and dishwasher appear newer. Veneer is coming off the kitchen counter, the cabinets are banged up and the faucet needs replacing. In the bathroom, you will find peeling wallpaper surrounding the original fixtures and filth dropping down from above the tub where the drop ceiling is not completely finished.    The unit contains all the appliances you will need, including coffee maker, blender, can opener, all cooking pots, pans and utensils, along with dinner service. The furniture is mainly wicker, giving more of a Hawaiin theme to the room, and well maintained. The Balcony overlooks the grounds in between the buildings of the Whaler and gives a good view of the ocean and part of Black Rock.    The biggest problem to guests of any unit is the parking. The Whaler's owner and guest parking is underground, beneath the common grounds between the buildings. Concrete chunks fall from the ceiling on a regular basis, forcing the maintenance crew to construct a lattice work of 2x4's and chicken wire to catch the falling chunks to avoid hitting cars or people walking in the garage. The floor of the garage is always wet, leading one to believe there are either leaks from the koi pond above it or from the ocean (since there are warning signs indicating that high tide will cause additional water.)    Overall, we enjoyed the Whaler and its location, and would recommend it, especially if they can make adequate repairs to the parking garage. However, I cannot recommend Unit #764 without the owners renovating it. These units sell for upwards of $1.5MM, so it surprises me that the owners are unwilling to spend $30-50K to have a completely up to date and more attractive unit. Friends that made the trip with us stayed in another studio that had been completely upgraded within the past five years and paid the same price as us, but received a much more enjoyable experience.",Dec 2006,December 2006,Traveled as a couple,,"Cape Coral, Florida"
6174959,50,Wonderful Honeymoon at the Whaler!!!,"We stayed at the Whaler from August 28 until Sept 1st for the first part of our Honeymoon in Maui. We had arrived so late the day of our arrival because of a massive delay from O’Hare. They were warm at check-in, and when we went up to our room there was a bottle of Champagne and a pineapple waiting for us! It was such a nice touch to start our trip!    The location is great. You can walk to Whaler Village, which has several places to eat. The beach outside the Whaler is also beautiful! The pool is ok, but the great beach location makes up for it. I was so-so about staying at a condo type resort, but wow I changed my mind! I loved that we had a full kitchen. Which made it easy to buy food at Safeway and have breakfast in our room on our lanai. The rooms even had blenders, which we used to make afternoon cocktails. The rooms were a decent size.    The staff was very friendly and helpful!!    The only negative I have is that everything here is a la carte. Chairs for the beach, and to play tennis had a fee. But overall this resort is a great deal!    I do have to say that this place was the best part of our trip. We did stay at a 5star property on Waliea, and if we come back we will be staying at the Whaler. It’s not the Rtiz, but it’s the perfect location for a great Maui vacation with a great price!",Nov 2006,October 2006,Traveled as a couple,,"North Wales, Pennsylvania"
6137879,50,"Location, Location, Location!!","My husband and I went to Maui and Kauai in October 2006. While in Maui, we rented unit #661 from alohacondos. It's a studio, but very spacious. The place was very clean and very well stocked. The decor was very nice. The only negative (and I hate to say that, because it wasn't a big deal at all), was that there wasn't a washer/dryer in the condo unit, but there was a coin operated one on each floor, and you can get change and detergent in the lobby.    The location is excellent. We walked next door to Whaler's Village for coffee and danish every morning, also for drinks at night. You can walk to the Sheraton to see the diver at sunset, and to snorkel at Black Rock. It's so close to Lahaina. They also have a shuttle to Lahaina (ask at the concierge desk) for $1 each way, although it only runs until 8:30pm.    We never used the parking garage, so I don't know about the comments that say it has pieces falling from the ceiling. We always parked in the overflow parking by the front gate.    I highly recommend The Whaler, and this unit specifically. It is so much cheaper than any other websites that I found. We paid only $175 a night for such a great room in such a perfect location.  Okay, yeah, I agree with the other people that the pool is small, but I'm in Hawaii to see the sights, not the pool, so who cares???? I grew up in Florida, so I don't go on vacation to go swimming in a pool, I go to see thing that I will never get to see again!

6092757,40,"Loved the resort, issues with the condo owner","I would highly recommend the Whaler, and would even stay again, but would book through the resort directly, even though it costs a bit more. We have been having a lot of trouble getting our full deposit back from the owner, who has kept a portion of it to have the carpets cleaned. There is more information on this in the Maui forum, titled ""Whaler 420 -be careful"" -I don't want to waste too much time on this in my review.    We booked unit 420 through VRBO.com. We had this unit and the other people in our group rented 502/503, which is connected to make one large condo. We LOVE the location of the Whaler, convenient to both Whaler's Village and to Black Rock for snorkeling. The condos are spacious, with very large lanais on them, perfect for coffee in the morning or relaxing at the end of the day. The resort staff was very friendly without being intrusive, which we really appreciated.

6086868,30,Loved the beach at The Whaler,"The location can't be beat! We had two units, a large ocean front with wrap around lanai with 6 people it worked well. Also a one bedroom (4 people) no ocean view, but decor was totally updated, very islandly.    I prefer having daily cleaning as with a hotel, but the rest wanted a kitchen. We had such an incredible view and everything right at our fingertips. The Whaler shopping and restaurants right next door made for very easy going. If anyone wanted anything - it was there. Black Rock, for snorkeling was just a short walk down the path. We swam with sea turtles and just enjoyed the beach every day!    We were there for several family celebrations, my daughter became engaged during the stay, so it was the most wonderful setting we could have wanted.    If you are looking for a large pool area, you need to go to one of the hotels, but with the ocean at your feet, no need to go further.  The parking is lacking, but otherwise, it was very nice. It isn't the most updated facility, if you want that, go to one of the big hotels.  We had a great time and explored the island all week long.

6026596,40,The Whaler is where I will always try to stay,"Took my entire family here and rented 3 studios, 2 on the 7th floor and one on the 9th. We here there Oct 13 thru the 18th (yes we were here for the earthquake!).    The Whaler has a professional staff. The grounds (the whole area surrounding) is what you would expect Maui to be. The Kaanapali Beach is beautiful and not at all crowded like Waikiki. Loved being so close to the famed Kaanapali Beach. And the Whaler is right next door to the Whaler Village where you can fiond excellent dining, a food court and lots of shopping.    Our studio, #713, faced inwards to view the center courtyard. Every room has views fo the ocean and the sunsets. The island of Lanai is just off the coast. The studio was well appointed and had updraded features. The balcony was HUGE. If I had the money I would buy won of the units at the Whaler, I liked it that much. My only complaint was constant standing water in the underground parking garage, which was no big deal except when we brought rented Harley's down there to park and the floor was slick.

6017994,40,The Whaler perfect for families,"We enjoyed 12 days at the Whaler at the end of September. This was our second visit to the Whaler and think it is perfect for a family vacation. We have two young children(4 years & 8 months) and booked a ground floor unit (159) through Maui Beachfront Rentals. What a great location for children. The Lanai opens up to a nice grass area where the kids can play while mom and dad enjoy a Mai Tai. Also the ground floor unit is nice for young families as it provides easy and quick access to the beach/pool. No need to haul umbrellas/coolers/toys etc down the elevator and back up. Unit 159 also has a good ocean view for a ground floor unit and easy access to the great BBQ area. Condos are definately the way to go with children, the extra space compared to a hotel room makes a huge difference. The small pool is the only downside to the whaler, but with the ocean steps away, and all of the other benefits of the Whaler, we will be back again soon!

5964232,50,The Whaler was outstanding.,"We recently stayed in a 2bd 2bath unit at the Whaler. We truly loved our stay. This was our third vacation to Hawaii, and by far, our best, in terms of where we stayed. We stayed in unit 952, which is on the 9th floor of tower 2 (south tower). The condo is a corner unit (on the northwest corner), so it is right up against the ocean. It has a huge, wrap-around lanai with access from the dining area, living room, and both bedrooms. The views were truly incredible... 270 degrees with panoramic views of the ocean, offshore islands, black rock, and the mountains to the east.    I've read several of the other reviews for this property. I can certainly understand some of the less favorable reviews. It's true that the individual condos probably vary quite a bit. We were very fortunate in what we got. We did not go through the owner directly, but through ResortQuest, via a package over the internet. We did book it very early (6 months in advance). About 3 months prior, I called the front desk, and requested a room on a ""higher floor"". They were very polite and helpful on the phone, but said they ""could not guarantee"" anything. Fortunately, things turned out ok. Our unit was well furnished, the carpet was reasonable clean, the furniture was pretty decent, the lanai had lots of chairs, and the kitchen was well stocked.    It does seem that some of the units on lower floors may not have very good views. Unlike in some hotels/condos, where the 1st floor of units is actually a few floors up (due to the lobby, ground floor, etc), the first floor of units at the Whaler is directly on the ground. You probably need to be at least a few floors up to get a good view of the ocean.    In walking up and down Kaanapali beach, and looking at the properties, I'd say that the Whaler is probably still one of the best, if not the best overall. For us, having a large lanai with great views was a must. It seems like the lanais on the Whaler are much larger and more spacious than those of all the other properties. Ours was also well furnished, so we could have our meals out on the lanai and enjoy the ocean views. It also has one of the best locations on the beach. As you walk further south, towards the Marriot, Hyatt, etc., the beach becomes much more narrow and steep. The Whaler is right next door to lots of restaurants and shops at the Whaler's village. It is also very close to Black Rock, which has great snorkeling. The beach in front of the Whaler is nice and wide (though possibly not quite as wide as that of Kaanapali Beach Hotel and the Sheraton). However, it does not seem as crowded as some other properties, either. It has a more peaceful relaxing feel than some of the crowded hotels, which was just fine by us.    Overall, we were fortunate to get a great unit, despite not hand-picking it through the owner directly. We would love to go back to the same place again in the future!",Oct 2006,October 2006,Traveled with family,,"Ladera Ranch, California"
5936951,50,Exceeded our expectations,"My wife and I along with our two teenage boys stayed at the Whaler for 8 nights beginning the last week in September. We booked our trip through American Airlines Vacations. When we arrived at the property I asked the front desk if we could see several units before making a decision as to which unit to stay in. We had booked a 1 bdrm, 2 bath unit and the front desk allowed us to inspect two such units before making a choice. We chose unit 1008 which was on the 10th fioor in tower 1. It had a wonderful ocean view of Black Rock and Molokai. The lanai (balcony) was about 35 ft. long and about 9 ft. wide. There were two entries onto the lanai, one from the bedroom and one from the living room. It provided a great view of the ocean and the ever present sound of the ocean waves cascading against the shoreline was unforgetable. The unit was furnished with rataan furniture, nothing fancy but certainly adequate. There was a kingsize bed in the bdrm and sofasleeper in the living room. Additionally, the Whaler can provide you a rollaway if you need one. The kitchen was nice and comes with all of the dishes, utensils, pots and pans you need in order to make meals during your stay. Both bathrooms were more than adequate. The unit was very clean and well maintained. The only mild complaint about the unit was that the carpet had seen better days,however, it wasn't too bad. There is daily maid service and a free morning paper. The Whaler's manicured grounds had a tropical feel and were well maintained. The pool and jacuzzi area has a lot of charm and is very clean. It has plenty of lounge chairs and clean towels are provided free of charge between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. A few reviews about the Whaler have stated the property is outdated and worn. This is not the case at all in my opinion. While it may have been built 30 years ago, the Whaler has been very well preserved and is in very good condition. It is the equivalent to a 30 yr. old well preserved home. The best part about the Whaler is the beach and the location. The beach is a swimming beach and is one of the very best beaches on Maui. The location is enviable-next to Whaler's Village and many restaurants and resorts on Kaanapali beach. I can't imagine the beach and location being any better than this. Before selecting the Whaler I had considered booking the Mahana, therefore, I could not resist visiting the Mahana to see if I made the right decision. The grounds of the Mahana are very nice, the property appears to be well maintained. I went through the lobby area and out to the pool and beach. The pool area was not nearly as nice as the Whaler's and the beach was pretty much non-existent--no room to walk or lay on the beach in front of the Mahana. While I am sure the Mahana is a very good property, it's beach and location pale in comparison to the Whaler. However, the Mahana is located as about as close to the ocean as you can get so I am sure the view from your condo is spectacular. The Whaler is significantly more expensive than the Mahana so if you can't afford the Whaler I would definitely stay at the Mahana. In closing, we had a terrific experience at the Whaler and would definitely stay there again. Thanks to Trip Advisor, your site was invaluable in helping me select the Whaler and I hope my post is helpful to others who are deciding where to stay on Maui.",Oct 2006,September 2006,Traveled with family,,"El Paso, Texas USA"
5933883,40,Great Location,"This place is actually a condominium complex. Each unit is individually owned, though many are managed by ResortQuest. I initially contacted an owner directly. This particular owner had a minimum stay requirement that I couldn't meet, so he graciously contacted ResortQuest and got me an owner referral discount that was better than the internet rates on the hotel's website.    The disadvantage of reserving through ResortQuest is that you cannot choose your room. I preferred a high floor for the view, but ended up on the second floor.    Aside from this, there are a number of advantages with reserving through ResortQuest that aren't available or cost more when reserving through individual owners: daily maid service, no registration fee on arrival, updated rooms. The maid service even took care of the dirty dishes we left out from the breakfast we cooked in our kitchen.    Our studio oceanview room was good-sized and perfect for a couple. The pool was nice and not too crowded. There is no restaurant or bar on site, but there are some at the nearby hotels.    This hotel is right in the middle of Ka'anapali beach, with great snorkling at Black Rock only a 3-minute walk away. Next door is the Whaler Village, which has restaurants, shopping, and a convenient store that we found to be very... well, convenient.    A couple of complaints: when we arrived, the studio room they had assigned us was not ready yet. They could have upgraded us to an available room, but instead told us to leave and come back at 4pm.    Also I wanted to use the business office briefly one evening and was told that I couldn't because it was closed. I pointed out that there were still about 10 minutes left before the closing time posted on the door. They reluctantly let me go in, but it was clear that they just didn't want to have to deal with me.",Oct 2006,September 2006,Traveled as a couple,,"Austin, Texas"
5932763,30,"Just okay, nothing great","Short version...it was okay for our first trip to Maui but we wouldn't stay here again. For all the details, keep reading.    My wife and I stayed here for a week in September 2006. As numerous others have stated, the facility is ageing and in need of upgrades. The Whaler itself admits this (to its credit) in a handout they give you during check-in which states that the facility is showing its wear and you need to be aware of water problems and the possibility of falling concrete in the underground garage. To be fair, I didn't think the underground garage was in nearly as bad of shape as what I have read in other reviews, or even in the Whaler's own literature. We didn't observe or have a problem with either water or falling concrete. And they do have an outside parking lot although it is not as convenient as the underground garage.    Our room was very nicely decorated, practical, and roomy for just the two of us. It had cable tv, free internet, stove, refrigerator, microwave, dishwasher, plates, cups, utensils, etc. It did however have a musty odor to it that was noticable upon entering the room. We did sniff tests in various places but couldn't smell anything on any of the furniture or carpet. We assumed that it must be coming from the air conditioner unit and one day left the Lanai doors wide open (without air cond running) which appeared to cure the problem. We could have asked for another room, but frankly after 20 minutes or so we just got used to the odor. Like the garage, the room showed some age but it certainly was not to the point that we felt we weren't getting our moneys worth out of it.    The facility itself is rather drab and there is no attempt to spruce up the grounds with a hawaiian atmosphere (tiki lights, etc). In my opinion, it is literally just a place to sleep which is what I thought I wanted when I booked the room. I didn't know what I was missing until I walked through the Sheraton facility on Black Rock which really has an impressive hawaiian atmosphere on the grounds and is just a ""fun"" place to hang around. Of course, there's a price to pay for that kind of atmosphere and the rates at the Sheraton reflect that.    The Whaler has no restaurants, cafe's, or other such facilities. Yes, Whaler's Village is just a two minute walk away but we didn't find any of the three restaurants there to our liking. Two of them are extremely expensive, and the Hula Grill had too many flies around to enjoy eating. Of course you can always visit restaurants at other hotels or just go into Lahaina where there are lots of places to eat.    The Whaler's pool is a typical rectangular backyard swimming pool. We didn't use the pool because there's a much bigger one (the one we came to see) about 50 feet to the south. I figure pools at resorts in Hawaii are for those who can't swim or are afraid of the ocean for some reason. However, there are other facilities that have long flowing pools throughout their grounds including water-side bars. If you are not going to enjoy the ocean but DO want a pool with atmosphere, the Whaler pool will probably not thrill you.    One of the biggest positives for the Whaler is that it is located on one of the best sections of Kaanapali beach. We swam directly opposite the hotel and snorkeled there as well. Only 20 yards or so offshore there is coral with lots of fish. We swam with our masks and fins down to Black Rock and then flittered with the Sea Turtles, needlefish, triggerfish, and every other kind of fish you can think of. VERY VERY convenient if you like the ocean.    We found the staff pleasant and friendly. This is a gated facility and the girl at the check point always had a nice smile. The room was cleaned adequately every day between 1pm and 3pm. We received a plump, juicy, delicious pineapple within 30 minutes of checking-in as a welcome from the facility which was a nice touch we weren't expecting.    My advice to you is this...look at yourself truthfully and consider what kind of person you are and what kind of facility it is going to take to please you. Then take a look at your wallet and consider the compromises you might have to make. Some of the negative opinions I have read about the Whaler are outragious compared to what I experienced. Yes it is showing some age, but it's not a dilapitated building waiting to crumble into the sea. However, it is a no-frills facility. It is no different than any other high rise apartment building you might find in any large city (except it is in Maui). When we booked the Whaler, we figured that we didn't care about restaurants onsite, we didn't care about the pool because we intended to use the ocean, and we didn't care about the atmosphere because we didn't expect to spend much time at the facility. After all, we're tourists and would be out touring around.    I do not regret booking the Whaler. It was functional and convenient. However, knowing what I know now about the other facilities in the area I would spend the extra money and stay someplace else the next time. It's not that the Whaler is a bad place to stay, its just that some of the other facilities are so much nicer. And in fairness let me add finally, there are other facilities in Kaanapali that are a LOT worse than the Whaler.",Oct 2006,September 2006,Traveled as a couple,,"Boston, Massachusetts"
5932286,50,Whaler was Paradise,"We stayed at the Whaler in late September for our honeymoon.

5810797,50,Great resort on Kaanapali.,"We stayed at the Whaler Aug. 26th - Sept. 2nd and had the perfect Hawaiian getaway. We booked a one bedroom one bath, 12th floor unit through vacation-maui.com. The condo and the view from the lanai were exactly as pictured on the web-site.    My husband and I, and our children ages 10-12 loved the beach. It was a short walk to Black Rock (5-10 minutes) where we snorkeled and saw tons of fish, sea turtles and some kind of ray (this was before the Crocodile Hunter incident, so people were getting pretty close!) We had lunch at the Sheraton, which is the hotel closest to Black Rock. We ate at the pool and the kids took a little dip in the ""mega pool"", then it was back to the beach.    We enjoyed the Old Lahaina Laua. The grounds were beautiful and the employees put on a good show. It was fun watching them unearth the roasted pig. This laua was really expensive, and I'm not quite sure it was worth so much money, but it was done to perfection and the family enjoyed the experience.    I loved watching hubby and the kids surf for the first time. The instructor , ""Kimo"", at Maui Wave Riders in Lahaina was excellent. All three were able to stand up on their first wave.    The Whaler shopping center located next to the condos is excellent for shopping and dining. We loved the Hula Grill, with their sandy seating area, live entertainment and beautiful sunsets.    The Maui Ocean center is definitely worth checking out if you have kids. They have a fabulous viewing tube and floor to ceiling glass everywhere. You can see rays, sharks and all kinds of fish swimming around you.    I highly recommend calling The Whaler Resort your home base on your next trip. Kaanapali is a fantastic Hawaiian destination vacation and the Whaler is ""no ka oi""!",Sep 2006,August 2006,,,"Orange County, CA"
5804552,50,Great experience at the Whaler,"Our family of 5 (with three kids between 5 and 12) just returned from a great trip to Maui! After using TripAdvisor to narrow down the lodging options we decided on The Whaler, then looked to find a unit by owner. We came across the site for Karin, owner of Whaler 420 (VRBO #65021), and are so glad!    We had great service from the Whaler staff. The unit itself was very clean and nicely decorated. Though it's a one bedroom, there's a pullout couch (queen) and 2 aero beds. It's a great value for up to 6 people!    Since we were here in September, crowding complaints about parking and the pool weren't issues. We used the complimentary gas grills for one dinner. The Whaler's convenient access to the beach, to Black Rock, and to the other activity on Kaanapali is tough to beat! And getting a place with room enough for our family, that's quiet, that comes stocked with some beach/snorkel/boogie boarding gear, etc. was absolutely wonderful.    The owner was very easy to work with--a true delight. We highly recommend the Whaler and this particularl unit!

5794751,40,Had a great time!,"We spent one week in June in an unit on the 8th floor of Tower One, the one closest to Black Rock. Our family had a great time! We booked it directly from the owner. Evidently, this unit is one of those condos which is shared by several owners, nevertheless, it provided everything we needed - even chairs and umbrellas.    The decor is not fancy, but there was plenty of space including large bathrooms and a huge lanai, where we would have our breakfast each morning. We always found parking underground, but we never came home after 7pm. Warning: if you have a northside unit lower than the 8th floor, you will be looking at the hotel next door.    Yes, the pool is small, but it was never overly crowded and it was the closest pool to the beach. We loved the beachfront location and its proximity to Whaler's Village - with all its shops, restaurants, ABC store and great free Hula shows weekly. If you want a good basic condominium only steps from the ocean, then the Whaler is a great value.    We definitely are planning a return trip!",Sep 2006,June 2006,Traveled with family,,San Francisco Bay Area
5784676,50,LOVE the Whaler!,"This was our third time staying at the Whaler on lovely Ka'anapali Beach and we couldn't have been happier with our decision to return.    The Whaler is great for families who want a more low-key time. The condo resort consists of two towers, with a pool and gardens in between. The buildings are probably the closest of the resorts to the ocean. So, regardless of the unit you rent, you will see the surf, unless you stay on the first floor. Plus the beach is the largest in this area.    To clear up the confusion - the Whaler is many things. Many units are privately owned with year-round residents living in them. Some privately owned condos are available for rent. These units were top notch oceanfront and oceanview condos and I can’t recommend them highly enough (you need to contact owners directly). You will pay more at the Sheraton for a hotel room or family suite than what you will get at the Whaler. Finally, Resort Quest rents out the remaining condos, like a hotel would. I can not vouch for the RQ's condos, but the privately owned ones are in great shape and worth the price as many have been updated and have a personal touch. So, you may not know what you are getting if you go directly through RQ (they operate the front desk, and I suspect that is what you get if you call directly or go through a travel agent), but you can guarantee it will be nice with a private owner, with many listing their condos on private websites that you can find through a simple google search, or looking on websites for condo owners like VacationsFBRO. I also keep a list of people too.    Now that that is cleared up (as I saw alot of bad RQ press), the Whaler is in such a great location! Right next to the Whaler Village - which means you never need to get in your car (unless you need to run to Safeway or venture out to Lahaina). Resturants and shops are a quick casual stroll next door.    The beach is very beautiful and great for long walks, snorkling, body surfing, and day-dreaming. You can rent cabanas, chairs and umbrellas from a third-party on site, but I recommend heading over to Snorkle Bob's in Lahaina - I believe his rental package included 2 chairs, a cooler and umbrella for $30 for a week. (The cabanas are $35 per day)    The pool is quite nice, but I warn all the pool lovers of the world that the Whaler is not a mega-resort with pools the size of Manhattan. Its a regular pool, that you can swim in, or lounge about. Expect no bells and whistles that you might find nearby at the Sheraton, Hyatt or Marriott. Its clean, pretty and kid-friendly.  There are plenty of tables and chairs, and several grills which gives you no reason not to enjoy your very own oceanfront dining while there. The grills are cleaned daily.    I would love to point out that the two bedroom/two bathroom units are approximately 1400 square feet (quite spacious!) with 500 square feet of a wrap-around lanai (not your ordinary hotel lanai thats for sure!). The kitchens are well stocked, there are chairs and tables and loungers on the lanais, central a/c, washer and dryers in most (otherwise on the floor), etc. etc.    Finally, as I saw it mentioned, there is a parking garage underground, and yes, there are some puddles, but I am not sure how that would impact a vacation. When the garage is full (and it will be if you pull in at 9pm at night), there is a lot about 100 yards from Tower I – which is by the tennis courts. It is by no means “out of the way”. I guess you would need to stay at the Hyatt to understand out of the way parking lots. Everything at the Whaler is small and manageable.    Feel free to contact me with any questions. I love the Whaler and I love Maui…and I would lov",Sep 2006,August 2006,Traveled with family,,"Seattle, WA"
5778308,50,Loved the Whaler,"We've just returned from a week long stay at the Whaler. The location was perfect, right on the beach, easy walk to great snorkeling at Black Rock. Restaurants along the beach walk are handy for a sunset dinner. We rented snorkeling gear for a week at Maui Dive just steps away in the Whalers shopping area. Our unit was a well eqippped top floor studio with views of the ocean and Black rock. We were impresssed with the manicured grounds,and the security and the friendly staff. The pool is small but clean and beach towels are available for check out. We stocked our condo with groceries from Five Star Market in Honokowai ( much nicer than Safeway) and had breakfast and lunch at ""home"", venturing out for dinners. The resorts along Kaanapali appear to be the same age, the Whaler may be a bit dated but it's in good company. Apparently the units vary alot but if you get a good one the value ( and location! ) can't be beat. Okay the garage does have pools of water here and there, and warning is given, but we had no trouble parking and as a garage it's perfectly functional. We would definitely stay at the Whaler again .",Sep 2006,August 2006,Traveled as a couple,,San Francisco
5693739,30,Good Budget Choice on Kaanapali beach,"Just spent 5 days in Maui for a family wedding, and the Whaler was just fine for our needs. As long as you have the right expectations the Whaler might be just perfect for your trip.    We rented unit #661 through Aloha Condo’s, and it was a fun room (think 1950’s Hawaiiana) with great views of Kaanapalli beach. I really enjoyed ""coming home"" to our unit, and would highly recommend booking directly through an owner so you are assured of what you are getting. My mother booked a room through the resort and did have some problems with cleaning, the air conditioner, and she was given a room without a washer/dryer. We spent more time in the room than I had anticipated due to utter exhaustion from wedding activities, so we're glad we booked the unit we did and didn't leave it to chance.    The things we really liked about the Whaler were our room with its fun canopy bed, the convenient location, and of course the price. It was great to stock up on drink fixings next door at Whalers Village. The view from our room was really lovely, and it was great to have a drink in the afternoon on the lanai without having to leave our room. We didn’t use the kitchen for any cooking, but if you enjoy doing that on vacation I can see how it would be very convenient.    The areas where the Whaler is lacking are in the traditional resort amenities. I agree with another reviewer that a face lift for the resort would go a long way. The pool at the Whaler is small and unimpressive next to the other Kaanapali resort pools, and the garage is downright scary. I found the lack of a restaurant onsite inconvenient, especially as only one of the restaurants in Whalers Village is open for breakfast. We walked to the Westin every morning for breakfast, which made me realize the extra $100 a night at the Westin would have been offset a bit by having a $50 buffet breakfast included in it.    For the price and for an active vacation such as ours (no time to go to the pool), we are happy with our budget choice of the Whaler. However, if we return to Kaanapali for a traditional vacation we would probably stay at the Westin or the Hyatt.",Aug 2006,July 2006,,,"Boston, MA"
5578006,10,overpriced,"Just returned from a week at the Whaler. Before renting this property people should be aware that the pool is way too small to accommodate everyone. The garage is full of water, huge puddles. The overhead beams are cracking and falling down. Most of the units are in sad repair. Very dated. The only positive thing about the Whaler is its location. Fortunately we had friends at the Sheraton and we were able to use their pool. Never did go into the Whaler pool. Too crowded. Very overpriced. I would never go back.",Aug 2006,July 2006,Traveled with friends,,
5504650,40,Great place,"Kaanapali Beach is great location, and the Whaler isa well placed condo tower (being very close to the great Black Rock snorkeling end of the beach). The biggest thing you hear about the Whaler on trip advisor is that some people dont like the units they get. We hand picked unit #723 (a fantastic 2 bedroom unit). Other members of our group were not as happy with their selection (grandma hated the dirty carpet in #313). In any case, choose carefully, or ask if you can request a change if not happy. If you get the right unit, this can be a great experience. We had no problems with the garage, and found that proximity to great snorkeling, decent restaurants (and a food court), and close to Lahaina made this an excellent choice for us.",Jul 2006,June 2006,Traveled with family,,"Marietta, Georgia"
5496149,30,Needs a Face Lift,"We recently stayed at a 2 bedroom, 2 bath unit at this Condo/Hotel. We had a wonderful view, but our unit was an esthetic nightmare! The furniture did not match and was not terribly comfortable. It looked to us that aside from the kitchen equipment that the unit had not been updated in at least 20 years. None of our sliding doors onto the balcony area had screens, which meant we couldn't leave them open without being inundated with bugs. We had problems with the ""daily maid service"" which most days meant that the maid would run in and out with fresh towels and nothing else. The parking (for which you pay $7 per day) is either in a lower level garage, which seemed constantly flooded, or at a remote lot, which was not very convenient. The pool area is very cramped, so unless you get up at the crack of dawn and stake out a chair at the pool, you'll get nothing. The location is good because you are close to Whalers Village and the shops and restaurants there. The concierge was very helpful. I don't think that for the money it was a great value, but maybe that is because we booked through a travel agent.",Jul 2006,July 2006,Traveled with family,,"Chicago, IL"
5375968,40,"Fantastic location, bargain price","Our first trip to Maui was to celebrate our son's high school graduation. We chose this location because of the variety of activities there seemed to be at Kaanapali. It was the perfect choice.    Our unit, 108, was on the ground floor with easy access to the pool, barbecues and fabulous beach. It was clean, nicely furnished and the kitchen was well stocked for cooking. Though it is advertised as a 'garden view' we had a nice view of the ocean from our living area and master bedroom and from the lanaii.    Some family members joined us so I had an opportunity to see firsthand what I've been reading in some of the reviews of the Whaler. It definitely seemed to be true that the owner managed condos are in better shape and more up-to-date. Research your specific unit!    Kaanapali is a heavily populated area, don't choose it if you don't like crowds. However, for us we loved the walking access to many activities. Tours leave the beach right in front of the Whaler and Whaler's village shopping and restaurants are only a few minutes walk. Snorkeling at Black Rock is a 10 minute walk and there is a path running the length of the resorts along the beach.    If you like to exercise, get to the walking path about 6:00 am, it's not as crowded yet and it's a perfect temperature.    The area felt safe and I did not worry about wandering around the beach and walkway at night. There are lots of people, entertainment outside nightly and security for all the hotels usually visible along the way.    We had a great dinner at Leilani's, near the entrance to Whaler's Village. Try their Mango Colada! . Kimos in Lahaina was good too.    The only negative thing about our stay at the Whaler was that because the building is older, there were a few construction projects happening. Three just happened to be centered near our room and involved jack hammers. They tried to be sensitve about the scheduling but jackhammers are noisy!    Overall you cannot beat this location, the beach is wonderful and fun, lots of activity close by. And after comparing rates with the nearby resorts, The Whaler was a great deal for us.",Jun 2006,June 2006,,,"Springfield, OR"
5318513,50,Best..Dollar for Dollar,"Vacationed there first time May 10-17th. I agree with most of the previous posts .Location is a 10. Next to Whalers Village Mall. All the shopping, restaurants, you will need( at a 2 minute walk) including McDonalds You will go 3 miles to Lahaina for Safeway shopping (with immediate discount card) prices same as mainland on 80% of items..liquor cheaper. Lahaina also has restaurants( all prices )including Ruth's Chris Steak House. and many boutique shops, pizza shops, Everything on Front Street ( about 5 blocks long.)  3 or 4 Luaus..Feast at Lele in Lahaina should be your choice..100 guests as opposed to 400 elsewhere..2 waitstaff at your individual table instead of buffet and tables of 10 elsewhere. Portions just right, you will not go away hungry..or thirsty .drinks are not watered. Show was awesome. Hula Grill..2 minutes away at Whalers Village is a must stop for dinner and free show at sunset and Happy Hour. Prices for snorkeling, parasailing, bike trips etc..vary on who you buy tickets from..be aware..  We rented the condo from an owner which saved us a considerable amount of money..but be aware owners maintain condos differently. some keep it up to date..others drain it and let condo run down... Owners have their own website offering their condos..Worth looking into Rooms are huge! Much larger than ajoining higher priced condo complexes we visited..Closet space more than adequate. Rooms, hallways, laundry, all very, very clean..No problem at parking garage except $ 7.00 daily fee and not enough inside parking spaces...The grounds were beyond awesome ..manicured to perfection...daily. Pool adequate and very well taken care of.. The only disappointment we had was the lady attendant at the tennis court. she was having a very, very bad day and not very helpful..so we didn't return .( We had previouly played there 3 days , being taken care of by a very helpful gentleman) ..I will stay here again if given the opportunity....Remember ..Look into owner renting..preferred room choice would be..above 6th floor( Tower #1 , odd numbered rooms..)

5313305,50,The Whaler is the best buy on Kaanapali Beach,"We just returned from a trip to Maui where we stayed at the Whaler on Kaanapali Beach. I wasn't sure I was going to like it when we first arrived because the lobby isn't grand like the new hotels and it looked just a bit tired. We got in late and were given our keys. We parked in the garage which is very convenient and then made our way up to the 11th floor in tower 2 and my sister and brother in law to the 12th floor in tower 1. The elevator looked worn. I was feeling let down. The huge surprise is that this hotel has the most wonderful views in the world. My sister's room overlooked the entire bay towards the snorkeling rock. It was simply the most fantastic view ever. Ours overlooked The Whaler's shopping center and was fun to watch as well as the magnificant view looking over the ocean. We watched parasails and enjoyed the enormous deck. Our bedroom was huge. The kitchen was ordinary but imaculate and the living room was furnished nicely with a flat screen tv. All in all, this is a great place to stay. I would highly recommend you request the 11th or 12th floor. Lower down trees block the view and the smoke from The Hula Grill could be problemsome. The price was less than most anything in the area and for the money, it's fantastic.",Jun 2006,May 2006,,,California
5313042,40,Whaler needs a facelift,"We've been staying at the Whaler for 15 years and love the quiet resort located on a beautiful beach with shops and restaurants in walking distance. The toilet in our unit was easily clogged, the towel rack in the bathroom was coming out of the wall, and housekeeping was hit and miss. Not small things like I didn't get as many washcloths as I need, big things like they didn't make the bed. The parking garage is literally falling apart, there are warning signs up about falling concrete and water dripping in the garage. The pool needs redone. None of these things detracted from our enjoyment of paradise, but maybe people who don't love the Whaler like we do would be a little put off by this.    Something that was new was what we referred to as Pool Patrol. These are people who hand you your pool towels and also rent cabanas and sell sunscreen. One woman in particular was rude and nasty and the only way to appease her was to buy sunscreen from her. It would have been comical had it not been so sad. They literally walked around the pool area on a regular basis ready to reprimand people about trivial things. I didn't have any confrontations with them, but other guests did and it was unnecessary. The pool is open till 10:00 but you have to turn your towels in by 5:30. One day I returned mine at 5:15 and Pool Patrol informed me they had already turned the cards in, meaning that I would have been charged for the towels had I not walked over to the front desk and told them about it. Not the Aloha spirit at all.    The Whaler is still a great place, but maybe they should rethink Pool Patrol and hopefully spruce things up a little.",Jun 2006,June 2006,,,San Diego
5287629,50,Stay here!,"My husband and I stayed at The Whaler for our honeymoon in November. We booked it through travelocity. It was an asbolutely wonderful experience. The room we were in was not outdated at all. We got a partial ocean view- which actually was great. Looking one way you had a great view of the ocean, and in the other direction was a magnificent view of the green hills. The service was great there as well. Everyone was friendly and helpful. We ate breakfast and lunch on our patio almost every day, which was great. It is located right next to a shopping center with great stores and great food. We loved Hula Grill- we ate there a lot. There is live music outside on their sand patio. The food is reasonable and great. Leilani's was also a good place to eat. The pool was small at the Whaler, but who needs a huge pool when you have a warm ocean right in front of you! I felt very comfortable and at home in the large rooms. The bathroom was huge, and the closets were as well. The kitchen had all the necessary appliances and cooking utensils. I would definitely reccomend this place to anyone (in fact my cousin stayed there too on her honeymoon and had a great experience as well.) My husband and I are going to go back with his parents in the next year or two. We absolutely fell in love with it and had not one complaint.

We bought our week-long vacation package 4 days before we left. Everything went perfectly. The Whaler was a perfect place for our family. We booked a rooom listed as a ""1 bedroom, 2 bathroom room with ocean view."" My wife really wanted to be able to see the ocean from the room and listen to it at night. See got what she wanted! Our room, which we didn't select, was on the top for of the north tower on the north side. The condo had nice wool carpet which was great for the 9 month old to roll around on. Having two bathrooms felt luxurious. Once again, the condo room was perfect for our family! The hotel was definitely bland compared to hotels in Las Vegas for example, but we didn't care. We came to Hawaii to be on the beach, in the ocean or kicked back in our room.    Here are some tips: You can rent snorkle gear in Lahaina at any shop for about $25 for a week...Much cheaper than the outfits on the beach at the hotels! Eating dinner at the beach side grills costs about $10-$12 a plate vs. $25 a plate in the actual resturant. Use good sun screen as recommended by the snorkle shops. If you have a car, small kids and like to snorkle stop ask about ""mile marker 14.""",May 2006,May 2006,,,"Missoula, Montana"

Our condo was a penthouse studio on the 12th floor that was privately owned and had recently been remodeled. It was elegantly decorated and you couldn't beat the view from the lanai. We loved having everything so close; the beach, shopping, restaurants and even snorkel excursions were available within steps from the hotel. The grounds of the Whaler are immaculate and the pool and spa are relaxing to hang out by. My husband and I soaked in the spa almost every night of our stay. The beach is also very clean in Kaanapali and the water is perfect for swimming. We were very pleased with the value of our stay in Maui and at the Whaler!!    One of the best restaurants we went to was the Plantation House in Kapalua. We also enjoyed Hula Grill and Leilani's. We should've skipped the luau at the Sheraton because the food was horrible and the drinks were only so-so.

The rooms were huge compared to other condos we have stayed in. The storage was incredible. Absolutely huge closet space with lots of hangers(one of my pet peeves--no hangers in closets) Two baths has become a must even for our small family. The condo was clean and the lanai and view spectacular. We were in Tower 2, second floor. Some have complained about noise from Hula Grill--only heard morning chatter about duties once and sometimes ""dish"" noises in evening,but nothing to get worked up about. The fresh pineapple in the fridge to welcome us was a special treat. Maid service each day was so nice--we only wished the time was more consistent. We never had trouble finding a parking space in garage nor did any chunks of concrete fall on us or our car. The grounds are impeccably kept. I watched a supervisor scour the grounds early each morning picking up minute pieces of wrappers or something left behind. I cannot say enough good things about The Whaler.

4934859,40,"Wonderful Location, Very Clean","My husband and I stayed at the Whaler from Mar. 22-25, 2006 for our 10th anniversary. While I agree with other reviewers that our oceanview studio (#513 in tower 1) was outdated (plain white walls/ugly flooring & carpet), it was clean and very convenient. The x-large ceramic tiled shower was heavenly and the walk-in closet was helpful as well. The murphy bed was surprisingly comfortable and made the room very spacious when tucked away. The grounds were immaculately kept. I was up early every morning and noted that the pool and grounds were cleaned before dawn every single day. The views of the mountains and ocean were lovely and we ate breakfast and lunch in our room everyday saving loads of money. We also blended our own frozen drinks to have by the pool. One of the concierges (Kerri) was extremely helpful in booking tours for us, including her best guess on which days were going to have the best weather for what we were doing.    Our plans had us at the Whaler for 3 days and then at the Sheraton for 3 days. While I admit that the Sheraton was more luxurious, it had problems that come with a large hotel (less personal service, filthy pool, hard to find lounge chairs, longer walk to parking/pool/etc.), not to mention the room was much smaller. We actually liked the Whaler better. If you are expecting luxury, the Whaler is not for you. But if you want a homey feel in a fantastic location for a little less money, it is a bargain.

They tell you in advance that the parking garage is under construction but we didn’t have any problems finding a spot.  The beach on the Kaanapali side is very nice and clean.

Having A/C was helpful as well though in December you don't really need it that much, it's great to sleep with the breeze flowing in and the sound of the ocean lulling you to sleep. Short drive to Safeway, Lahaina as well as other nice beaches. Didn't hear any noise at all from neighbors. It's a condo but feels more like a hotel with a kitchen. We will definitely stay here again if we ever go back to Maui. NOTE: We spent half our trip at this condo and the other half in another condo in Kihei, and I think this turned out well because West Maui (where the Whaler is) and South Maui (Kihei and south) have completely different atmospheres and it was good to experience both. - - DCR, New york, NY",Jan 2006,December 2005,,,"Danville, Pennsylvania"

Fabulous, clean beach, Black Rock snorkeling, Whalers Village 1 minute away and the best sunsets in the world! 1 bedrm/2 bath oceanfront on 7th floor, Tower 1 was awesome. Soooooooo much to do in the area!  Clean rooms, hotel service style and the choice to dine on your terrace or go out! Barbecues by the pool too.

4301313,50,"Loved The Whaler, going back in 2006","On our 10th trip to Maui for my 40th birthday, we stayed in a Condo for the first time. We stayed in a wonderful 1 bedroom 2 bathroom oceanfront that was awesome. We booked direct from an owner, and knew which unit we'd be staying in before we arrived. I understand if you book from the hotel, or a tour company, they can't give you the specific room, and there are many variations depending on the owners. We could have spent all day and night on the lanai whale watching, people watching, taking in the smells and sounds. The beach is great, and the walking path along the beach is a big benefit to staying on Kaanapali. The pool is basic, especially when you walk past the luxury resorts along the beach, but it's confortable and clean. We were so pleased with the complex that we are going back in March 2006. If you want to book direct from an owner, start early. We subscribe to ""Hawaii"" magazine, which has a lot of owners in the classifieds. Many of the direct owners are particular about the number of people, smokers, kids, etc. Great choice- highly recommend.",Dec 2005,March 2005,,,"Minneapolis, MN"
4300851,40,Fabulous location + large rooms!,"The Whaler is an excellent place for families. The location is one of the best on Kaanapali beach, and the large rooms were great for our family of 2 adults, one teenager, and one preteen. We stayed in an oceanview 1BR/2 bath unit. The view was fabulous and our balcony was enormous--it wrapped all the way around the corner on which we were situated. The kitchen was furnished with modern appliances including a microwave and full-sized frig. There were even 2 boogie boards and 2 beach chairs in the closet!    The reason I didn't give the Whaler 5 stars is because it is aging and it shows. When you check in, you are given a warning flier about using the garage, including the possibility of water seepage and falling rocks. Not too encouraging. Our bathrooms and their plumbing were definitely showing the years. Also, the pool area is sub-standard, although this didn't bother us as we were there for the beach.    Overall, the Whaler was an excellent choice for our family, and we were willing to overlook the minuses because of its many pluses. If you want a prime location with large rooms, I highly recommend the Whaler!",Dec 2005,December 2005,,,"Mission Viejo, CA"
4255993,50,Great Place to Stay!,"My husband and I stayed at the Whaler from December 3-10th, 2005. We had a studio in Tower I facing north, room 1018. The staff at the hotel was always friendly and helpful. The condo itself was great. It was spacious and comfortable with lots of closet space and a fully equipped kitchen. There was even a blender for making frozen drinks. We liked being on a high floor, especially since if you are in a north facing room in Tower 1 and on a floor lower than 6, you will just look directly into the dumpy Kaanapali Beach Hotel. We had breakfast every morning on our lanai with a beautiful view of Black Rock and Moloka'i. We were there before the high season, but we never had a problem finding a space in the garage. However, I could see it getting pretty crowded. The pool area at the hotel is nice and clean and the bbqs are a nice feature. The beach in front of the hotel is also one of the most beautiful and widest parts of Kaanapali beach. (Many of the other luxury hotels have almost no beach)You can easily walk from your towel to black rock to snorkel. The path along the beach is also very nice and takes you to all the nearby, larger hotels. Its also great to have Whalers Village so close by, so that if you don't want to drive to dinner, there are four restaurants right there. We liked staying in Kaanapali. It was convenient for doing all the sightseeing we wanted to do. It's also only 15 minutes from Lahaina, where there are lots of restaurants, shops, nightlife, and excursions leave from there. My only complaint is that the Whaler does not provide chairs for the beach for free. Although, all the hotels seem to charge for chair, umbrella, and cabana rentals. This can get pretty expensive if you are there for a week. We went to Walmart in Kahului and bought inexpensive beach chairs that we kept in our room. They also sell beach chairs at Long's Pharmacy in Lahaina. Overall, we had a great time and would definitely stay at the Whaler again. Feel free to email me with any questions.",Dec 2005,December 2005,,,"Westport, Connecticut"
4252008,40,great place,"stayed 5 nights, would have stayed much longer, but ran out of vacation time.  Everyone was friendly and the staff was there when needed the room was clean and pleasent.  The beach was great, but a non swimmer should wear a floation device, due to the surf and the water gets deep quite fast.",Dec 2005,June 2005,,,Hillsdale

4148734,40,Great location!!!!!,"We stayed at the Whaler from Nov. 3-12th. Nine days of bliss!! We had a ground floor (1 bed/2 bath) unit looking at the Black Rock. Breakfast on the lanai every morning - aahhh. We also used the BBQ grill alot in the evening. The sunsets are beautiful and waiting for the torch lighting every night at Black Rock was great.  You definetly need a car (convertible). We highly recommend the Warren and Annabelle Magic Show in Lahani. We don't usually get into that on vacations but it was truely great. Had dinner at Kimo's before and had an enjoyable evening.  The drive to Hana was breath taking. If you have the time, stay in Hana a few nights. The drive is quite long as we went all the way around. (We left at 7 am and returned home at 6 pm with just a few stops)Suggestion: Do the drive north of Kanapalli, around to Blow Hole and stop at the Ocean Club for late lunch. That really gave us a good indication of what the drive to Hana would be like.  ENJOY!!!!!!!  P.S. We booked our room thru vrbo, dealt with the owner of the unit, Dianne, she was VERY helpful.",Nov 2005,November 2005,,,"Keller, Texas"
4142329,40,Great Condo,"My husband and I have just stayed at The Whaler from 9-17 Nov. We stayed in room 624 in tower 1.  After much deliberation and reading of reviews and books we liked the sound of this Condo set up. It was our Honeymoon so we wanted something special but to be independant too. This was the 2nd leg of 3 destinations in the USA.  Upon check in, the receptionist said as it was our Honeymoon did we want an upgrade (we had booked a studio Ocean view room through Bookit.com). Of course we said yes, she said she could one for $20 per night, which we thought was a reasonable deal as we would have a much larger condo. We were happy with this when we walked into our condo as it was lovely !!!! Shame we didn't get any other 'Honeymoon packs' like we believed the Whaler gave to each Honeymoon couple.  Our Condo had a dual aspect which we found most pleasant. The interier of the condo was excellantly furnished. There was everything one could possibly need. The kitchen was superb, maybe the bathrooms needed a slight refurb to match the rest of the condo.    The position of the Whaler in Kaanapali is very good. Its right on the beach and literally next to the Whalers Village, where you can find shops (most very upmarket !!!), a few restaurants and bars. Found Maui on a whole expensive, but everything is imported so its to be expected i guess. Beware the restaurants tend to close early (by European standards), we found if you walked in ater 9pm, it would be a rush to get you fed and out the door by 10pm. Plenty of early nights !!!  There is a free bus that run to various hotels/condo's in Kaanapali or a $1 each way bus that runs to Lahaina town but really you need a car. This is something we would have preferred not to do but it is a must as everything is so spaced out and public transport is not easy to find to everywhere.  The beach infront of the Whaler is really very nice, except the Whaler will make you sign a form because of the strong currents of the sea.  The garage seems to be a slight bone of contention for some guests, our only complaint was a water leak that we found in our hire car. There must have been a water leal dripping into our jeep as all the drivers side floor was sodden !!! Also $7 per day for parking ???? reasonable compared to some establishments ???  Overall we rated the Whaler very highly and must say it suited what we wanted and had virtually no complaints, only small suggestions and comments.  Would definitely recommend this place without a doubt.",Nov 2005,November 2005,,,"Worcestershire, United Kingdom"
4085361,50,Whaler was Great!,"Rented a one bedroom, 2 bath through Costco travel with convertible and saved about $500 (10/20-10/30). Unit 1212 was very nice. One Queen bed, and one pull down queen murphy bed. Kitchen was nicely furnished with almost anything needed, including blender(for pina coladas), toaster, microwave, and all utensils, pots and pans. Huge Lanai, shaded from the hot sun. Without a doubt, the best part of the unit is the view and the location. Looks right at Black Rock, with expansive views of the ocean and Molokini. You are within walking distance of everything in Kanapalli, including great snorkeling, and shopping at Whaler's village. The service was also excellent. The housekeeping even did the dishes. The pool, while not spectacular, is certainly clean and nice. Parking while crowded, was always available albeit sometimes in the overflow lot, which is only a short walk from the building. The shopping carts in the garage are a nice touch when unloading your supplies from Costco. Would certainly stay at the Whaler again, and defintely would recommend the Costco vacation program.",Nov 2005,October 2005,,,"Lake Zurich, IL"
4053926,50,Plush Whaler,Just returned from a week in Maui at The Whaler. Was a plush condo right on the beach.Excellent service. People we very pleasant. Was upgraded to Oceanview room. Everyday there was a rainbow...This Condo will be rented again.,Oct 2005,,,,"Phoenix, Arizona"
4051811,40,Great Location,"We stayed at The Whaler from 10/15/05 - 10/23/05, in tower 1, which was a 1 BR/2 BA condo. Overall an excellent place to stay, the condo was nicely furnished (fairly new furnishings), and there was ample space for just the two of us. Easily could fit a family of five.    The location is the strong point, right on the best part of Kaanapali Beach, quick & easy access to the Whaler Village shops and restaurants right next door. The pool isn't fancy like the mega-resorts, but was plenty adequate for adults.    Only negative was on 10/16, they had a major power failure that somehow wiped out the air conditioning system in tower 1, and did not get fixed before we left. Fortunately our unit had cieling fans in the living and bed rooms, so it was pretty comfortable.    I would recommend considering The Whaler as the location is just tough to beat, the condo was clean, roomy, and well furnished.",Oct 2005,October 2005,,,"Denver, CO"
4046482,20,Satisfied but there are issues,"We just got back from a four night stay in unit 420 (VRBO # 65021). We rented direct from the owner who is very friendly and helpful. The unit is gorgeous and recently remodeled.    In general, the resort is as the previous posters have said. Nothing to add except this:    The day before we arrived, the air conditioning for the entire complex broke down due to a power surge. When we arrived we found several flyers posted around the facility letting people know that the air was off and that there was no ETA for repairs.    After getting settled in, I called up the maintenance department wanting more information. They lamely told me, “no idea” when asked about the status of the repairs.    Finding this answer lacking considering the high price of the room, I called up the general manager, Bradley. He was rather rude and brusque on the phone. His first statement to me was, “You must have too much time on your hands to be asking me...” about the air conditioning. At this point I was getting rather upset. His attitude was that it’s broken and will be fixed when they get the parts from the mainland. He had no idea how long it would take.    When we left this morning the air was still off in both towers. People we spoke to were pretty upset. Everyone had their windows open to trying to get relief from the heat.    Another related issue is that when the windows are open, you can hear people from the neighboring tower and you can smell cigarette smoke from the people smoking near by.    Another issue is the lack of parking. If you arrive after 6:00 PM, forget parking in the main underground lot. It was full every night. There is a small over-flow lot that started to get full around 11:00 PM.    If you don’t care about the lack of air conditioning and you can deal with the parking, then I definitely recommend staying at The Whalers and in unit 420 specifically.",Oct 2005,October 2005,,,"El Dorado Hills, California"
4021626,40,Excellent value and convenience,"I really enjoyed my stay, highly recommend this property and wouldn't hesitate to book again. Knowing what I know now, I would probably specify that I want a unit in a certain line or with specific features.  I stayed in Unit 362 (studio) in Tower 2 for 4 nights and then 1169 (1 bd 2 bath) in Tower 2 for one night. I agree with the reviewers below who stayed in Unit 162- I enjoyed the north side of Tower 2 and its shaded lanai. I was able to keep the sliding doors open all day and night (with screens) and no A/C was needed. The 62 line in Tower 2 are the studios with the best ocean views. My studio had a king size Murphy bed which was a breeze to operate- great mattress- and gave the room a sense of real spaciousness. While I was there, friends stayed in another studio on the south side of Tower 1 (unit 1214)- no Murphy bed and a strange dining set up- and that unit felt much smaller although it has an identical floorplan. The studio had a TV but no other electronics.  The 1bd2bath unit felt enormous but I needed the A/C on all the time because it was on the south/sunny side of the tower. There also seemed to be noise and night light from Whalers Village below. The 1bdrm was furnished with a little more elegance than the studio (not important to me) and a ritzier, larger kitchen. It also had 2 TVs, DVD player, VCR and boombox. It would have been plenty spacious enough for two couples.  Some comments on the general operation- the courtyard door to Tower 2 was broken and wedged open for most of my stay- there didn't seem to be any rush by the staff to get it fixed. Since the beachside walkway opens into the property, in theory anyone could walk into the building and gain entry to the hallways and parking garage through that door. However, I did not perceive any real security problems while there.  The staff was very friendly and mostly eager to please- although they don't seem to be staffed quite as heavily as a full time hotel might be - not an issue for me but might be for some.  Since each unit is uniquely furnished, you may want to specify that you want a studio with a Murphy bed. My more elegant 1bd2bath unit didn't have screens on the doors- so leaving them open would have been a problem.  The north side of Tower 1 (even numbered units) faces the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel property. The south side of Tower 2 (odd numbers) faces Whalers Village. For anyone who is concerned about sound, insist on a unit facing the inner courtyard (odd numbers in Tower 1 or even numbers in Tower 2) or directly on the ocean. Whalers Village also throws up light at night.  I saw comments below about the parking - I used the underground garage the entire time without incident. Yes, there were warnings about falling debris, but I didn't see any evidence of it.  For anyone who is not familiar with the Ka'anapali area, this property is really well situated for access to dining and shopping and other hotels. You could leave the car in the garage for most of the time and enjoy walking up and down the beachwalk for many of your needs and entertainment.  I paid the internet special rate through Resortquest and feel that I got very good value compared to what some of the hotels were charging.",Oct 2005,October 2005,,,"New York City, New York"
4014537,50,Loved the Whaler,"We stayed at the Whaler from Sept. 28- Oct 6 and loved it. It's in a great location on the beach. We stayed in unit 661 which was very nice with views of the beach and mountains. Loved seeing rainbows almost every day. We don't have any complaints, everything went well during our stay. The grounds, pool, building, everything was well kept. The pool may not be as big as other places but who it's no big deal when you've got a beautiful beach. It was good having Whalers Village next door for shopping and browsing. We really liked Maui. Don't worry about the weather, it was the same everyday, mostly sun with a few sprinkles of rain once in a while, even with the sun shining on you, and very warm ( hot). It's beautiful and more laid back than Waikiki. Would go back tomorrow if the flight wasn't so long ( 14 hours ). Great place !",Oct 2005,October 2005,,,"Halifax, Canada"
4003681,40,The Whaler was the Best,"We rented a gardenview studio unit from Sept. 24-Oct. 8th and we loved it. We were in Unit 162 in Tower 2 facing the inner courtyard. If you are facing the courtyard tower 2 is the tower to be in as the lanai has shade all day. We noticed that people in tower 1 didn't come out onto their lanai until sunset as it was in the blazing sun all day.    Our unit was spacious, nicely furnished and had all the amenities I could ever want. The living area had a murphy bed so it made the living space nice and big during the day. We had a huge walk-in closet, a large bathroom and dressing area and the toilet and bathtub/shower were separate.    The grounds are immaculate with a large fish pond with a bridge in the center. There was always a couple of fellows working on the grounds, whether it be mowing the lawn, trimming bushes, planting flowers, etc. They even came by every second day with a leaf blower and blew leaves off the grass and lanais.    The pool area isn't fancy but there is lots of room and when we were there never crowded at all. There is also a hot tub.    The lobby is like that of a hotel with a concierge and bell desk. A new business center is just off the lobby with 5 computers, printer, copier, etc. It cost 30 cents per minute for a computer.    This was our 4th trip to Maui and our first time at The Whaler. If we return to Maui we will definitely stay at The Whaler again. It's the best!",Oct 2005,,,,"Pitt Meadows, Canada"
3992984,40,THe Whaler was great!,"I stayed at the Whaler for the second half of my trip to Maui. It was perfect. I would definitely go back. It is located on a prime spot on Ka'anapali beach..the beach is fabulous. The pool was very nice as well. Granted it does not have all the ""bells and whistles"" that pools at the resorts have, but it was never overly crowded and chairs were always available. I had no desire to sit by the pool..as the beach was so great.    My studio was in great shape and nicely furnished..and the view was fantastic. I suppose there was a little bit of updating that could be done, but generally speaking, renters are VERY hard on vacation condos..so you would not put super expensive stuff in the condo anyway.. But all was great, it was kind of like being at home for the week.    The parking garage was perfectly fine as well. I had heard alot of bad things about this as well but never had any problems. The grounds are monitored frequently by security and are kept up very well. The lobby really is like a hotel, with check in desk, activity desk, internet room, etc. There was also a beach towel check out by the pool which was perfect.    The only bummer was that there was no blow dryer for my hair!! BUT, the good thing is that on Maui ...who wants to blow your hair dry anyway when you will just end up in the ocean!!    I will go back!",Oct 2005,September 2005,,,"North Bend, Washington"

Awesome views from the 11th. floor of ocean, black rock and West Maui mountains. Room was highly upgraded all the way down to a 32 inch LCD television in the bedroom, granite countertops, etc. Staff was great and very friendly and accomodating as always.

3880208,50,The Whaler at Kaanapali Beach,"My new husband and I stayed at The Whaler from 8/13 - 8/20. We were married in Wailea on the 15th. (See my review for Precious Maui Weddings, first class wedding coordinator!). What can I say. The whole trip was unbelievably perfect. From the time we checked into our room we were surprisingly pleased. We felt at home immediately. Our room was beautiful. When booking the trip I made certain requests and each one was met: high floor, newly-renovated, oceanview. We were on the 11th floor and had perfect views of the ocean, mountains & golf-course. There were champagne, glasses, a pineapple & chocolates waiting in the fridge for us as we were honeymooners. We never had a problem with parking or bugs, the place is extremely clean and well kept. They even had grocery baskets in the garage for our convenience of getting things to the room. That was a very nice touch. We slept with our doors open every night to let the waves and ocean breeze lull us to sleep. It was sheer heaven being able to have breakfasts, lunches & a few dinners on our lanai where we could see everything. (Shop at Safeway with a discount card-takes minutes to get) We awoke every morning at 4:30 because of the time difference (5 hours ahead of us) and I was running on the beach by 5:30 just when the dawn was breaking and before it became crowded with other joggers. The beach was simply lovely and the ocean is crisp and crystal clear. I would spend a whole hour at a time just playing in the water. The walkway to Whaler's Village and other hotels is very convenient. We were right next door to Whaler's Village. One night we had dinner reservations at Swan Court/Spat's so we just took our time and walked along the walkway to the Hyatt. About a 15 min. walk. Renting a car is a must but Maui is very easy to get around. And we didn't encounter bad traffic.    For beautiful and elegant dining, we ate at the Seawatch in Wailea (after our wedding ceremony). WONDERFUL food & service. Exqusite decor & a piano that plays itself. We also ate at the Hyatt's Swan Court restaurant (Spat's was serving dinner at the location). The food was pretty good, I think I just made the wrong menu choice, but I had the veal layered with prosciotto & provolone and my husband had the rack of lamb (which he loved). But the exotic ambiance of being seated right on the lake more than made up for my bad menu choice. The waterfall, huge swans, & shimmering lights off the water was breathtaking!! For more casual dining we ate at Bubba Gump's and all the hype was justified. They have tremendous food & cocktails and at Leilani's, their Ono fish tacos were superb.    We thoroughly enjoyed the Old Lahaina Luau which was well worth the money: the food, the entertainment, the customer service. All first class.  Although my husband missed the acts with fire like at the Hyatt & Sheraton Maui. We enjoyed lots of shopping and the post office was minutes away where we could ship our purchases back home.    While it's true that that part of Kaanapali is very touristy with lots of kids, we were able to find quiet spots along the walkway more towards the Hyatt. It was so quiet in one place my husband dozed off into a deep, snoaring sleep. Very peaceful.    I will never forget my trip to Paradise and can only hope that other future vacations will be as perfect.",Sep 2005,,,,"Houston, TX"
3841607,40,Loved the Whaler,"We stayed at The Whaler on Kaanapali Beach for four nights in August 2005. I booked a 1 bedroom 2 bath unit directly through Aston and stayed in room #269. The unit was very large, had been recently renovated and easily accommodating my family of four (ages 12 and 15). The kitchen was extremely well equipped and the lanai was very relaxing and quiet. We could see the ocean but a higher floor would have offered a better view. The location of the Whaler was amazing. I enjoyed walking the entire length of the boardwalk along Kaanapali Beach and felt that our choice of condominums was perfect. Having Whaler's Village right next door was great for my family and the beach in front is spectacular. I would definately return to the Whaler again for a longer stay. We did not take advantage of grilling but would plan to if returned. I would also try to book directly through an individual owner and stay on a higher floor. My family's favorite excursion while on Maui was snorkling on the Four Winds II, the entire day was fun for all of us. Snorkling at Black Rock was also excellant and easy to do from our hotel. We had a great vacation and hope to return someday!",Sep 2005,August 2005,,,"Boston, Massachusetts"
3778620,50,Great stay and great value,"We booked our condo through the owner of the condo(------ or ------)and had great views, great condo and great price. We had a studio ocean view for 150 a night!(higher price in the winter- I think 180). You did not have daily maid service so had to wash your own sheets and towels if staying for a while. There was laundry just down the hall- it was fine for us. I would recommend booking this way so you can see exactly what youre getting.There are pictures of the exact condo you rent so no guess work. The owner was great about getting back to us with questions also. There was even snorkel masks to use! The views from the 10th floor were amazing- felt like we were on a movie set! It was also a plus to have great restaurants and sunsets right outside our door. On out last night, we got a table at Hula Grill and watched the sunset while listening to great music(get there at 6:00 to make sure you get a table in time for sunset-in August the sunset was around 7:00). You cant beat the location for the price!",Aug 2005,August 2005,,,Exton PA
3740440,50,Can't beat the Whaler!,"We just got back from our honeymoon on Maui and thought our stay at the Whaler was perfect. What we really liked was the fact we could drive maybe 3 miles down the road to the Safeway, pick up some groceries and prepare meals in the condo and enjoy them while watching the Maui sunset, you just can't beat it! The outdoor Weber bar-be-ques cooked the steaks right up! Another cool feature was the concrete walk-way up and down the beach on Kaanapali. That way you can enjoy all the views of the ocean and see all the other hotels, and Whaler's Village. It's also just a couple of miles from great shopping at old Lahaina. The pool is a bit small in comparison to the other hotels, but no big deal, just jump in the ocean and there's the biggest pool of them all!",Aug 2005,June 2005,,,"Virginia Beach, VA"
3694961,10,VERY DISAPPOINTED at The Whaler!!,"We just returned from our vacation to Maui. We booked The Whaler because of very good recommendations from our travel agent, as well as numerous good reviews on this website, but our experience didn't turn out very well. This was our 5th trip to Maui and we have stayed at a variety of condos and hotels, but we have never checked out early or had an experience like this one!  We booked the trip more than 7 months in advance and paid for a 2 bed/ocean front condo. We had 5 in our group, and the accomodations were SOLD to us as 1 king, 2 twins and a sofa sleeper. Our only request was that it be on a higher floor for a better view. We checked in on Wed. July 6 and were told the only 2 bed /ocean front condo was on the 1st floor. We were very disappointed, but after a long day of traveling decided to just settle in.  After checking in, we went to park the car. The outside parking is limited, so we had to park in the underground garage. It was then that we discovered the WARNING signs saying that the parking garage is aging and there could be FALLING CONCRETE that could hurt YOU or your car. ""Park at your own risk"".  We went to our condo, and the first thing we noticed was a rollaway bed in the living room. It didn't have a sofa sleeper as were the accomodations we had paid for. The next thing we noticed was the view. Being a 2 bed/ ocean FRONT condo the view should be great! Because it was on the first floor, there were shrubs to the top of the patio railing which was over 4 feet tall. So to see the ocean from the front, you had to stand up! That night we learned that the barbecue area for our tower was directly in front of our condo because people were out there enjoying the barbecue until the wee hours of the morning. When we went to bed we found that our king size bed was actually 2 smaller beds pushed together...where you felt like you were going to fall thru the middle. The next morning there was a note on our door that they were fumigating the INSIDE of the condos on Fri. and we would have to be out for several hours. Not only is that inconvenient to HAVE to be out, but we had someone with us with severe allergies and that would be a big problem!  We went to the desk several times and the best they could do was move us to a higher floor half way through our stay. I realize this is a very busy time of year and they can't be blamed for being booked up. BUT, the accomodations that we paid A LOT for were not what we got, and the front desk didn't really seem to care.  After going back and forth with the travel agency and the tour company we moved to The Hyatt on Fri.( before the fumigation) and enjoyed the rest of our stay on Maui. (The front desk was shocked that we checked out!)  Let me add that our condo was VERY clean as were the grounds of the Whaler. I didn't realize The Whaler complex was 30 years old, and the pictures of the condos on The Whaler website must have been updated, as our condo was out of the 1970's and nothing like the pictures.  While I would NOT stay at The Whaler again, I will definitely keep using this website to learn about other places to stay...it's full of great information!",Jul 2005,July 2005,,,"Alta Loma, California"
3655555,50,very nice digs!,"My family of four spent two nights at the Whaler on June 30-July 1, having booked the room through Costco travel. Our 2 BR/2 BA condo (#623) was lovely and very well furnished. The beach directly in front of the hotel was calm and inviting, more so than the Whaler's surprisingly small pool, and the snorkeling at nearby Black Rock was wonderful. My family really appreciated the large lanai (outside deck) of the condo, which we enjoyed for the ocean and mountain views at dinner. The Whaler makes available five gas grills on the lawn for cook-outs. Like many other follks (and all the ""regulars"" whom we met), we stopped at the Costco at the first traffic light outside the Kahalui airport to stock up on groceries before heading out to Kaanapali. The condo's full-sized kitchen is more than sufficient to store whatever you pick up. If you're looking for a mellow beach holiday on Maui's sunny west coast, and don't mind not having ""resort trappings"" like poolside bars and the like, the Whaler is a comfortable choice.",Jul 2005,July 2005,,,"Doylestown, Pennsylvania"
3652310,50,Room 759 at the Whaler is Outstanding,"I selected a room at this property from Vacation-Maui based upon comments from another traveler who wrote a review on their stay at the Whaler for TripAdvisor. I found Vacation-Maui offered lower rates than some other internet sites and they showed pictures of the rooms under their management. Based on the pictures from their web site, I selected room 759 which was outstanding. The owners of that property have a guest book and one of the comments was from family who rented out quite a few rooms at this condo. They indicated that room 759 was by far and away the best of any of the units they had an opportunity to see. This property is conventiently situated on the beach next to the Whaler shopping complex, which has some very nice restrants. It's also across the street from several golf courses and very convient to the town of Lahina, which offers a lot of nightly entertainment. I also liked the gas grills located on the property just off the beach. The swimming pool isn't fancy like some of the nearby resorts, but why go to the pool when the you're ocean front? And the trade between this property and resorts is that the rooms at this condo are huge and they have kitchens. FYI- I booked a bunch of entertainment through Tombarefoot and was extremely happy with the arrangements they made for me and my wife.",Jul 2005,July 2005,,,"Orlando, FL"
3606991,40,Great condo but not so sure about Maui...,"We stayed at the Whaler from May 27-June 3 and the condo was excellent. The decor was slightly dated but who cares about that?!  It was VERY well equipped with DVD player, tv in bedroom and lounge, huge Lanai and we had chocolate macadamias, pineapple and sparkling wine in the fridge for our honeymoon (everyone gets the pineapple). It was spotlessly clean and just steps to the gorgeous beach.  However, we are used to travelling to the Caribbean eg Grenada, Cuba, Mexico (not Cancun though!) and probably wouldn't go back to Maui. It is a beautiful island but it's expensive. We like to go out to eat fairly late eg 8pm and the restaurants at Whalers Village would be really busy from 5pm and having to book restaurants while on holiday takes a little spontaneity away from the evenings. Not a big hassle though admittedly.  One morning we had Omelettes for breakfast at Rusty Harpoon whcih were fine but with coffees cost us $30!  We then went to Safeway in lahaina to buy breakfast stuff, beer, water and some steaks (there are several gas bbqs/grills at The Whaler) and saved alot of money this way.  Also if you are used to all-inclusive resorts, bear in mind that to hire a cabana (or 2 loungers and an umbrella) on the beach from The Whaler costs about $25 a day (plus you get the hard sell from the beach concierge to buy their sunglasses and suntan lotions which, by the way, stink!). That, on top of $7 per day parking adds over $200 to your vacation.  We booked through expedia holidays who failed to mention that check-in isn't until 4pm at The Whaler. The receptionist was really unfriendly about it too until her colleague came on shift and ""found"" us a condo that was ready at 2pm!  Check-out is 11am and there is a shower room near the spa/salon, gym. Don't use it! It's was so dirty, there were no towels, it's co-ed but you can lock yourself in and I couldn't get out quickly enough. That was the only part of The Whaler that was in that condition but it was the final experience before going to the airport which is a shame.  Back to the positives!  One major plus for me was the food on the island. I ate fish, sushi or seafood most nights and it was exceptional. Definitely the best fish I've ever had. To eat in Leilanis at Whalers Village would cost between $60 and $130 depending on drinks , appetizers etc.  I had amazing tuna at Pacific'O in Lahaina but the service was a little standoffish for a fairly expensive place.  My Husband does not eat fish or seafood (except shrimp) and his options at restaurants (especially Pacific'O) were limited. Something to bear in mind. Yes there is a Ruth's Chris steakhouse but somehow eating steak, to me, isn't synonomous with a beach holiday! That's just me though!  If you are going to a Luau, book Old Lahaina Luau well before your trip. It was wonderful and the only authentic Luau. It was cultural, historical plus there was a decent buffet and unlimited drinks from the bar. Well worth the money. You get there by shuttle bus from Whalers Village (and walk through the Lahaina Cannery Mall) if you don't want to drive.  To conclude, if you want a home from home, Maui is in the US and I guess that's why it's so popular. There is a rich Hawaiian culture to explore and alot of sightseeing to do but if you like to eat out (and eat well) pack a thick wallet!",Jun 2005,May 2005,,,"Pembrokeshire, United Kingdom"
3540248,40,Great time thanks to the Whaler,"Stayed at the Whaler from May27 - June 3. The staff was very courteous and friendly. The room was great, a bit outdated but not much of a concern since very little time was spent in the room. The room was clean and room service did an excellent job of cleaning each day, including cleaning up the kitchen which was sometimes left a bit messy by me. The pool was OK, not on the scale of the Hyatt's or the Sheraton's but nice enough, again very little time was spent at the pool so not much of a problem. My only complaints were that underground parking was full after 8pm so we were always parking outside after a late night out. Also, some kind of internet access would be nice, even going to the lobby to use it would have been fine.    The close access to an incredible section of beach, awesome snorkelling at Black Rock nearby and the nearby restaurants were a plus. The garden area and koi pond were very well kept and I often saw staff working on the ground at 4 or 5am in the morning keeping the place looking clean.",Jun 2005,May 2005,,,"Park City, UT"
3531216,50,Wow Whaler!,"My husband and two children just returned from our 8 night stay(May 24-June 1, 2005) in Maui at the Whaler. I searched for at least two months for just the perfect place. I looked at rooms, location, size of lani, etc. The Whaler was the perfect choice. The staff at the front desk welcomed us with a big smile and a friendly Aloha. When we walked into our room our mouths dropped. We stayed in room 957 facing Whalers Village. We were one balcony over from a front facing room. Our view was picture perfect. Our room was recently updated and just beautiful. We were even surprised with a washer/dryer in one of the bathrooms. Not all units have this but ours did and it was a great luxury. Maid service came daily to change sheets and leave fresh towels. She even loaded our dishwasher! When we did meet her, she was so friendly.    We loved the view of the mountains to one side and the beach to the other. Whalers village was just below us and the smells coming from the restaurants were just heavenly.    Out of all of the other resorts we saw, Whalers had the biggest lani with the absolute best views. No other place that we saw even came close the size and view. 10 stars on this!    The beach was never too crowded and a close enough walk to Black Rock if you wanted to snorkel and see more fish than in front of the resort but, far enough away to be out of the crowd.    The walkway in front of the resorts along the beach was so nice. Everyone seemed to gather the most around Whalers Village so you felt like you were close to the action without being bothered. Everyplace we went along the walkway was sooo clean and perfect. In fact, all of Maui was like this.    If you are going to Maui for the first time we recommend a West Maui Hike and tour, Hal. Crater, Maui Tropical Plantation, Snuba, Luau's and maybe a shorter ride to Hana than we took. It took us 12 hours with 4 to 5 short stops along the way. We were so tired by the time we got to seven pool we didn't even see it. But, everything we did see was beautiful.    We also recommend Connie Mortensen at Expedia (Hawaii Activity World) for all your excursion needs. Her number is ----. She is great!",Jun 2005,May 2005,,,"Baton Rouge, Louisiana"
3522499,50,Loved the Whaler unit #1151!,"We were a little nervous deciding on The Whaler for our time in Maui since it was a condo and all the units were different. We were getting married in Maui and spending our honeymoon there and we wanted to have a really positive experience. The Whaler did not disappoint! We chose unit 1151 (11th floor), one bedroom two bath oceanfront, a corner unit with a wrap around lanai. It was a little pricey, but it was so worth it! We were there from May 16 - 23. We just loved sitting on our lanai and watching the beachgoers and the sunsets! The Whaler sits in front of a great beach, not far from Black Rock for snorkeling, and next door to Whalers Village for shopping and wonderful food at the nearby restaurants. The unit was remodeled with a very up to date kitchen, granite countertops, new cabinets and appliances, quiet air conditioning unit, and very clean. There was a pineapple in our fridge to welcome us when we arrived. The kitchen was fully equipped and we did a lot of our own cooking for breakfast and lunch and a couple dinners, which saved us money (got groceries at Safeway in Lahaina). The unit was very clean, did not see even a single bug inside the unit. We never had trouble finding a place to park inside the garage, and always close to the elevator. The front desk was wonderful answering our questions and accepting packages for us when we were out and letting us know. They even delivered our wedding cake to our unit when it arrived and we were out. We booked the unit through Karen Kondo at Monte D. Fitts Realty. She was great to work with and everything went smoothly. We highly recommend this unit and the Whaler, and we would stay there again!",Jun 2005,May 2005,,,Washington
3507811,40,Better than expected!,"Just returned from a week at ""The Whaler"" in Tower 2, Studio, floor 10 Ocean View. We were pleasently surprised with the size and cleanliness of the Studio. The king size bed was extremely comfortable and the furniture and carpeting was in very good condition.    The only slight downside was the quality of the kitchen and bathroom cabinets and kitchen stove, they were very clean and in good working condition, however, it was time for an upgrade (minor concern).    The underground parking at $7/day filled up every evening around 8:00 p.m. but there is an overflow lot close by at the Tennis courts that worked out just fine.    We loved our stay with the terrific views, serenity and sound of the ocean every night to sleep by......... We would not hesitate in returning to the Whaler!

3488704,40,Wonderful vacation,"My husband and I just today returned from our vacation at The Whaler on Kaanapalii Beach. After reading the reviews here I was a little nervous, wondering if the garage would be falling down, no swimming pool lounge chairs after 7:00 AM etc etc. We stayed in Tower #1 on the 11th floor in a 1BR, 1bath unit and it was lovely! A fully equipped kitchen where we prepared breakfast and lunch was cost saving and our ocean views were beautiful! Listening to the surf is so calming and enjoyable. OK the garage does need work but they are working on it and our location right next to The Whaler Shopping Center saved many a car trip! Restaurants and shops there are a must!",May 2005,May 2005,,,"Henderson, Nevada"
3460539,40,great vacation!,"After reading the somewhat mixed reviews it was with some trepidation we booked. I can now understand the problem. It is a condo hotel with each unit privately owned. Built in the late 70's some units have been reno'd a little, some a lot and some not at all! Still not sure how the rooms are assigned but we were the only ones checking in early (around noon) and were given the luxury of viewing 6 or 7 units. We were able to see different layouts; the special ocean front 2 bdrs, 1 br 1 bath and 1 br 2 bath. All were very large units with great lanais and all have views of the ocean! All have huge sliding glass walls for both LR and BR to lanai.    We settled on a North facing unit which had sun in the am and in the pm but not in between and was extensively and nicely reno'd with new carpets, kitchen etc. We paid a $30 upgrade fee for a 1 Bdr and 2 bath.    Be sure to ask to see various units that are available and check the beds in each unit as they are the owner's choice! Note that they have wonderful air conditioning - just redone.    So we are in the middle of a great holiday! Everyone at the hotel has been very accomodating and friendly and of course, the location is unbeatable. We would strongly recommend The Whaler but when booking ask for rooms that have been renovated. Hopefully, you'll be accomodated.",May 2005,May 2005,,,"vancouver, canada"
3459952,40,Just Back 4-26-05,"Just back end of April, stayed in condo 956. A 1 bedroom 1 bath condo located in tower 2, 9th floor. Only unit closer to the beach was the end unit which is ocean front 2 bedroom unit. A wonderful view of black rock and the sunsets. Next door to world class shopping (Whaler's Village) and 3 excellent restraunts. Staff was very responsive to all requests. Condo well furnished with new leather couch and wicker chairs. Fully equiped kitchen, and could not think of anything we needed. King bed very comfortable and high quality (thread count sheets) and master bath had, marble floors (kitchen too).....Just one drawback, limited parking in underground parking area. Also the grage area showed a little bit of wear and aging. But they were working on that. Pool are nice but not large. We did miss the pool activities and swim up bar but realized we gave that up for privacy and serenity. After all it was a condo and not a resort hotel. Overall 9.5 out of 10.

3452938,40,Honeymoon at the Whaler,"Our recent honeymoon in Maui was wonderful and the Whaler was a pleasant surprise. I was a little skeptical about coming to this hotel, because of some of these reviews, but we got exactly what we paid for. Upon arriving we were greeted by friendly staff. Parking is an extra $7 a day, but we never had to search around for a parking spot and always got a spot right by the elevator. The room was very clean and well kept. Some reviews complained about bugs, however, I did not find one our entire stay. The hotel gave us a two for one coupon for the luau at the Hyatt, which was great. The Whaler is right next to Whaler's village, which is great! I do not recommend the restaurants there though, as they are wayyyy over priced. It was nice to go out for dinner elsewhere, and we also stocked up on some groceries at Safeway in order to save some money on food.  We honestly had no complaints about our stay here! I highly recommend the Whaler for a good deal and great hotel stay.",May 2005,April 2005,,,Utah
3314068,20,Lacking customer service...big time,"VERY UNACCOMODATING!    We arrived at The Whaler on Sunday (March 6, 2005) at 10:30am not realizing that we were a bit early for check-in time. We were told by the woman at the check-in counter that we should come back at 11am. We said ok and went next door to eat breakfast in the whaler village.    At around 11:15am, we arrived back at The Whaler hoping to check in. At this point, the woman told us that the people had just checked out of the room and that we should come back in another half-hour...time for them to clean it. A bit aggravated at this point, we went out to the car to sit (in the a/c) and wait...and to book some activities by phone.    Over a half-hour went by and we walked back into The Whaler a little after noon. This time it was a different woman at the counter (the first woman was now gone for the day) - and she told us the room wasn't cleaned and ready and that the normal check-in time was 3pm. We were floored! If that were the case all along, why were we kept being told ""come back in a half-hour"". She didn't know. We told her what we had been told earlier in the morning, but her answer was still the same...that check-in time was 3pm. She was very unaccomodating to us under the circumstances.    We were upset at this point, but didn't put up as much of a stink as deserved. Aggravated, we left to go for a drive up the NW coast of Maui. The drive was beautiful and the sights quickly put us in a better mood. We drove for a couple hours as far as the road went before it turned from pavement to dirt.    We arrived back at the Whaler at 2:50pm. The first words out of the woman's mouth was, ""your room's not ready yet."" At this point, my girlfriend and I were stunned. What she said next is beyond logic. She told us that ""normal check-in time is 4pm."" That's right, the same woman that told us 3pm, now told us 4pm.    So,  at 10:30am - told to come back in 1/2 hour  at 11:15am - told to come back in another 1/2 hour  at 12:00pm - told to come back at 3pm  at 2:50pm - told to come back at 4pm...    are you kidding me?    After we threatened to write a letter to management and re-explained how we were being given the runaround...she blamed the first woman by saying ""I don't know why she told you to come back in a half hour"". She even had the audacity to go out back to grab a post-it note that had a ""3pm"" written on it then a ""4"" written ON TOP OF the 3....in PEN - saying... see...it says 4pm here. What did this proove? That she just wrote a 3 over a 4...? I still don't understand why she showed us that...    At this point she brought out a 3rd woman and we calmly explained how every time we walked in we're being told a different time. I said, ""if we come back at 4pm, are we then going to be told to come back at 5?""    So, the two of them go into the back office...then come back out...(this repeated a couple times) ... After a couple of phone calls to the cleaning desk (I guess they hadn't had it inspected yet), we were given the green light to head into the room (it was 3pm at this point). Gee, was that so hard?    I've gone to many other hotels around the country and have arrived early almost plenty of times...and the hotel will always make you a top priority - get the cleaning done - and get you in the room as quickly as possible. The Whaler made no attempt to make us a top priority - they were completely unprofessional and unaccomodating. Maybe it was the fact that we are a young couple, I dunno. They never offered to comp us or to make good on the situation they put us through.    The next morning at 5am we were awoken by TWO phone calls that sounded like a fax machine (but it wasn't a fax machine). Coincidence...who knows? We unplugged the phone each night thereafter.    other than that...  The room was a good size... however the bed was only a queen size. The hotel pool was incredibly small!    Next time I would gladly spend a little bit more money to upgrade our lodging to the Hyatt or the Sheraton (both looked amazing...the Hyatt pool was outstanding....and I'm sure the customer service was far superior).",Mar 2005,March 2005,,,"Tewksbury, MA"
3301043,50,Don't listen to the guy from Sonora...,"I have no idea what that guy was talking about. I have been staying at The Whaler for over 20 years and have had NOTHING but great experience there. Although I have stayed in dozens of their units, I can not vouch for the one he was in. I have to think that he must have just gotten a bad apple because all of the units I have stayed in have been BEAUTIFULLY decorated and immaculate(one bedroom 2 bath; one bedroom 1 bath; studio units. I have never stayed in the 2 BR units). This condo is without a doubt the best deal on Kaanapali beach. The units are huge, beautiful and clean. Not to mention the location is ideally situated ocean front right next to Whaler's Village with incredible shopping and restaurants i.e. Hula Grill, Leilani's and Tropica. The staff there are very friendly and there is an onsite concierge and a small grocery/gift shop with liquer, beer, soft drinks, food, etc. This place has been newly renovated on the outside and inside hallways and looks FANTASTIC. For twice the price ($500/night or so)you can go next door to the Westin or Sheraton Black Rock and all you get is a bed, a tiny bathroom and an even smaller lanai. The lanai's at The Whaler are HUGE; big enough to fit 2 lounge chairs and a dinner table with 4 chairs. The 2 bedroom lanai's are just obscene they are so big. They wrap around 2 sides of the building. The studio lanai's are even spacious.  I've been traveling to Maui for over 30 years and have been to all the islands. Since I discovered the Whaler, I have not stayed anywhere else on Maui. Kaanapali/Lahaina has it all and The Whaler is a wonderful place to stay. You will not be disappointed.

3294562,10,Very Unhappy with Whaler,"We just returned from a weeks stay at the Whaler. March 11-18. I have read many reviews of the Whaler and the majority was good. Our experience was terrible. The room that we were given was very outdated. The carpet was white with stains everywhere. The wallpaper was coming off and had hand prints and stains all over. The bathroom was filthy. The bed was rock hard. Inbetween the bed and the nightstand had never ever been vacumed. The floors in the kitchen were dirty and sticky. We complained about the room and they offered to show us a new one but none were available until the next day. The next room that we received had a better view of the ocean and was a little cleaner, but not much. I have read in some of the reviews that you don't go to Hawaii to stay in the room. This is true, but it does help when you have a comfortable, clean place to stay. The weather was cloudy and rainy for 4 of the days we were there and so we ended up in the room. When looking at the Whaler website, they don't show you the true rooms. I would not recommend this place, and I won't return.",Mar 2005,March 2005,,,Sonora CA
3270244,50,"Perfect location, great condo","Stayed in a 1br 2ba 9th floor ocean view South tower unit Feb. 15-23.  Suite was excellent. Well appointed, clean, comfortable; everything you need is furnished. Washer/ dryer provided via coin-ops in a laundry room on each floor [not in the unit as I had thought.]  I have read reviews recommending you avoid the S. tower rooms facing Whaler's Village. I have mixed feelings about that. Our room faced the courtyard/ N. tower; and while it's true that it was always quiet, and I have no complaints about the view; the drawback was that we never had any sun on our lanai. I cannot speak from experience re. staying on the other side; but I saw that their lanais do get sun exposure. The lanais are so spacious; and loungers are provided, so it would have been nice to do some sunning there if I could have. From the outside looking; it seems that as long as you are above the Whaler's Village rooftops (7th floor+,) those units would be great.  I wish that the Whaler staff would enforce the posted policy of not ""saving"" pool loungers (though this is certainly not exclusive to the Whaler; I'm sure we've all experienced this, worldwide.) Every day I saw people put towels down on the best chairs as early as 7AM, then not return for several hours; or one person would save 4-5 chairs for people who never came. The shortage of pool chairs would not be an issue if this practice was stopped; and if everyone would remove their towels when they leave (many people leave their towels on the chairs, so new arrivals assume the chair is still occupied.)  Personally I prefer to be on the beach anyway; but the first few days it was just too windy. Fortunately the latter 5 or 6 days were ideal.  As others have stated; parking is $7/ day and is very limited, but I do appreciate that they offer a secure, shaded parking facility.  I do highly recommend the Whaler if you need to have a fully equipped condo; but unless I find a better deal, next time I visit during peak season I will probably stay elsewhere on Ka'anapali Beach, primarily due to the cost. For our party of 3, none of whom was interested in cooking a lot; the meal savings just did not come close to offseting the room rate. I also rather like the convenience and social aspect of an onsite tiki/ pool bar, and the Whaler lacks this.  During my stay, the clientele was primarily seniors and families (not an ideal atmosphere for young-ish singles.)  If you are able to plan your vacation 6+ months in advance, you should have better luck finding vacancy through an owner. I did not have that luxury; so despite weeks of exhaustive searching, I finally had to book through Aston and pay an exorbitant rate (almost $400/night.) At checkout I learned that they do offer an Entertainment discount that would have saved $50/ night. (I had checked entertainment and it was not listed. So if you're a member, be sure to ask!)  I have stayed at 6 different places on Maui, and have always had a fantastic vacation. The Whaler was very nice; but I will not return unless I find a substantially better rate.",Mar 2005,February 2005,,,USA
3215355,50,Honeymoon In Maui,"We stayed at the Whaler the week of Feb 11-18, 2005. Both of us were extremely pleased with the condo we rented. The furnishings were very nice, and the view was excellent (1 bed/2 bath/ocean view). The Whaler is very well maintained. Parking could be more spacious, but it was never really a problem. Being located directly on Kaanapali beach, and next to the Whaler Village stores, puts you in an excellent position on Maui. There is also a boardwalk that runs the length of Kaanapali from the Sheraton to the Hyatt. If you like to golf, there are two very nice courses across the street from the Whaler (Kaanapali North and South courses). We took a cruise on a 65 foot catamaran to whale watch. This boat (the Gemini), along with other similar catamarans, pulls up directly to the beach for you to board. If you want to do a luau, and I suggest you try one, there are two on Kaanapali (Marriot and Hyatt), one at the Royal Lahaina, and two in Lahaina. Other activities include snorkling, diving, surfing, kayaking, horseback riding, and various island tours. I highly recommend a stay at the Whaler.",Feb 2005,February 2005,,,
3027667,20,Not Impressed,"My husband and I just returned from Maui yesterday. Our original room at The Whaler was on the ground floor - We found it smelly, loud, and very out-dated. Thankfully, the second day we were able to move to a room higher up in the tower which was equally outdated, but wasn't quite as stinky. The weather in Maui during our vacation was horrific - windy, rainy, and very cloudy. The Whaler has a gorgeous piece of property right in the middle of lots of restaurants and shopping. It was so windy there, however, we were unable to swim in the ocean (high surf) or sit on the beach (pelted by sand). The pool at the Whaler is very small and we found it to be overtaken by people of ""The Association"" otherwise known as condo owners. We found Maui in general to be very expensive - we are going to stick with the Caribbean because its sunny, fun and cheap!!",Jan 2005,,,,"Neenah, Wisconsin"
3024627,50,The Best Christmas Ever,"We stayed at the Whaler December 17th thru the 27th. I had done a lot of research and decided this was the place for us. We have two children 7 and 9 and the location was perfect. We booked a one bedroom two bath.This was through Pleasant Holidays so we weren't sure what room we were getting so, I called ahead of time and requested a mid level room as close to the beach as possible and a king bed in the bedroom. (as opposed to two doubles). When we checked in we were taken to our room and it was perfect just what we wanted. (even playstation and dvds for the kids!) We were on the 6th floor one room away from being ocean front and the views were amazing. They looked like they had just remodeled the hallways, new carpets etc. We stayed in tower 2 and it is all finished. I read someone else had a lot of construction going on during their visit. We did over hear that they will be overhauling the parking garage this year. I have to say that we drove all over the island and checked out various other hotels, the Whaler has the best location and the best beach you simply couldn't ask for more. This website was so very helpful in our booking the Whaler I had to write my own review. We will definitly go back to the Whaler.",Jan 2005,,,,"Los Angleles, CA"
3004674,20,Disappointed with Whaler,"My boyfriend and I returned from a trip in Maui in October. Hawaii was wonderful and we had a great time. It was beautiful weather, but the Whaler was pretty dissappointing. I looked and searched for a hotel for months. And I used this website. We got there and no one helped us with our bags. The condo was being remodeled and no where, were there signs of the remodeling. The staff also failed to mention it. We woudln't of been so surprised if we were notified. We parked in the underneath parking which was pretty croweded during our stay. We had to put our luggage in a shopping cart and push it to our room. It was actually pretty funny and made a great picture. As we got upstairs we were greeted with torn out lighting fixtures and cans of paint lying in the hallways. There was dust everywhere from the sanding of the walls. The room was spacious, though we weren't greeted with the pineapple in our fridge. We tried getting a new room to no avail. Two days after our stay we were able to change rooms, that room had the pineapple and was a lot better. The next day as we were going out we found out the jeep we had rented and parked in the Whalers' parking structure was overflowing with water. We left the top of on our jeep and the pipeing had leeked into the jeep. Fortunately, for us the weather was hot enough and we parked the jeep outside the structure and it dried pretty fast. The Whaler is a convienient place to stay at if you want to be by the big resorts and the Whaler Village(a shopping mall) made up of great stores. Its also in close proximity to Lahaina where there are great restaurants and shopping as well. I recommend the trip to HANA! That is made the whole trip worth it! Hana is gorgeous. I would recommend for anybody to buy a book to familiarize yourself with the island and available activities. Hawaii is a wonderful gettaway!",Jan 2005,,,,"Los Angeles, CA"
3004450,50,Loved the Whaler!,"After hours of research on the web, we chose Whaler for our honeymoon (July 2004) and it was perfect!  We requested for the highest floor possible and was given exactly what we asked for. We have noted that this trip was our honeymoon trip on our reservation and we were surprised with champagne, chocolate, and Hawaii pineapple, free, in our fridge!  We saved A LOT of money by having breakfast and cooking some meals in our studio.  Our studio was a little bit dated but very clean. The maid had done a great job cleaning it (especially all the dishes we left behind after breakfast/lunch) every day.  The Whaler is so close to the beach that we could hear the sound of the wave each night and that was just so relaxing...  The only complaint we had was, after paying $7 per day for the parking, we found the parking full one night when we came back around 9-10pm. Luckily, the hotel staff said we could park at the guest parking (there are about 5 right outside of the hotel lobby) and there was 1 left.  We are very looking forward to go back to Maui again and will definitely stay in the Whaler for sure.  By the way, remember to stop by Walmart and purchase all the water and basic stuff you need. It's quite expensive elsewhere. For food, Safeway is cheaper.  One more thing, buy the Maui Revealed book, it will help you A LOT on planning your trip (except the dining section which is not too helpful)!",Jan 2005,,,,
2967896,50,Fantastic Honeymoon location,"We stayed at the Whaler for the 2nd half of our honeymoon from December 16-22nd. We were in Tower 2, and booked through AAA/Pleasant Holidays. The first room they had us in was fairly outdated so we simply asked if they had any more updated rooms and they showed us a room on the 8th floor. It was a studio, completely re-done with a King-size Murphy bed in the wall, sofa, chair, and all the comforts of home. We had plenty of space for the 2 of us, they did offer us an upgrade to a 1 bed/bath for an extra 100/day, but seeing that is more of a hike than their original ticket price, we decided the studio was the perfect fit. We overlooked Whaler's village, but also had a view of the ocean and mountains and the perfect sunsets (the same view all units have). We stopped at k-mart by the airport and got breakfast and lunch food and went out for dinner each night. The beach area right out in front of the Whaler was great as well, it never seemed as crowded as the areas in front of the large resorts. It was a honeymoon to remember and we would definitely stay at the Whaler again.",Dec 2004,December 2004,,,"Springfield, Ohio"
2919282,50,Excellent!!,"My husband and I stayed at the Westin for our honeymoon in November '02, and for our two-year anniversary, wanted to return to Kaanapali, but were also interested in a condo as opposed to a (nice, but overpriced) hotel.    We rented our condo (November 5-14) from Monte Fitts realty, and were very pleased. The unit (9th floor, south building) was enormous, and our ""ocean view"" view was great! The unit was also extremely clean, and fully equipped. The only detractors from the Whaler were our flat mattress and some sometimes noisy work being done in the other building (somehow power tools can detract from an otherwise perfect day in paradise). The pool is not the water playground that the Westin offers, but it's well-maintained and a good size; besides, you should not be using the pool if you're in Maui!! The Monte Fitts staff was very helpful, and even gave us a very late checkout at no charge.    The Whaler's location is simply second to none. We will definitely return--and soon, I hope.",Dec 2004,,,,"Loveland, Ohio"
2900230,50,Extremely satisfied,"It's all about location, location, location! My wife and I stayed here in September 2004 for the running of the Maui Marathon. The room was perfect for the two of us with plenty of room (Studio, garden view). The building (building #1) , even though not facing the beach, still gave a partial view of the ocean while out on the patio.    The convenience is also great. We walked to our favorite restaurant (The Hula Grill - Barefoot Bar - you have to try the ""Ice cream Sandwich desert - to die for!) This is also a short walk to the other shops in Whaler's village. Also a great walkway goes about 2 miles down the beach and behind all the great hotels. Check out the lobbies, they are great.    The room was clean and homey and we liked the kitchenette for warming left overs from dinner and/or fixing breakfast before heading out.    If you bring a car you will pay an extra $7. per night to park. If I had it to do again, I would take the free shuttle from the airport and use other transportation without renting a car. A car is more convenient but not a must.    Great place to stay!",Dec 2004,,,,"Stockton, CA"
2878943,50,Saved our Kaanapali vacation,"What a great deal. Decent price, clean, large room, comfy. Definitely felt more like staying in a friend's condo than at a hotel (maybe because it's a condo...go fig). Nice water view. Stayed one night in a roach resort up the street before fleeing to the Whaler. We're coming back!",Dec 2004,,,,Seattle
2849143,50,Love this place,"We have been going to Maui almost every year for the past 20 years and this is our VERY favorite place. We always stay at Kaanapali because there is so much to do. I have to agree emphatically, the only way to stay here is to reserve through an owner ( just put in a search on one of the browsers,) and know where you want to stay. The best rooms are on the south side of tower one and the north side of tower two above the 4th or 5th floor as they overlook the courtyard, pool and also have an ocean view. The north side of tower one is good if you want a view of Black Rock and the Sheratorn Hotel. The South side of tower 2 is the least desirable as it overlooks the shops of Whalers village but if they are toward the ocean, they also have an ocean view which is nice but more noisy. If you want a decent view of the ocean you have to have a room that is west (oceanside) of the elevators. The view is best at the very west end of each tower, but the units that wrap around the ends are two bedrooms and very pricey unless you have a large group. The one-bedrooms are great for two couples or with kids because there are two bathrooms. When just the two of us go a studio is still very roomy. We have stayed at the Kaanapli Beach hotel at some of the best rates for this area, had good deals at the Maui Marriott and Maui Westin that included previewing timeshares but never thought they were as comfy as the Whaler. I like having a kitchen as it means we only have to eat out for dinner and I think we do save on that as everything is so expensive, but even more so, it's just more relaxing not to have to plan to go out all the time. If you're into room service or fancy swimming pools with grottos and slides and the typical hotel pampering of 4 or 5 star hotels, this is not the place for you. The physical appearance of the rooms and the locattion is as good or better but it does not have the same hotel feel or services and no on-site restaurant but Whalers Village restaurants are just as close as the ones inside most hotels are to your room. There is a fitness room, with pretty good equipment, tennis court, small convenience store, a concierge/travel desk and washers and dryers on each floor. I know this is a long post but the more you know about this place and the selection of rooms the better your stay will be",Nov 2004,November 2003,,,
2836263,50,Loved the Whaler!,"My husband and I stayed at the Whaler November 5-12 for the first part of our wedding anniversary trip.    We were in room #1124, on the 11th floor (out of 12) in Tower I. This is a king bed unit with two full bathrooms and since it was a corner unit, we had a huge lanai facing Black Rock and golf courses and mountains. What a view! Another nice thing about being in Tower I, facing Black Rock, is that you don't have another high rise to have to look at when you're out on your lanai. (Being in Tower II, facing Black Rock, would be disappointing in my opinion as all you really see is Tower I unless you are ocean front.)    The decor in the unit was nicely done and there was major upgrades being done to the hallways while we were there. (None of the upgrading interferred with our stay.)    I really don't have anything to complain about but if we had to, we didn't appreciate the noise that came from the top of the Kaanapali Beach Hotel, which is next to Tower I. It was some huge air conditioner or generator thing that would shut off and turn back on again throughout the days and nights. Since we chose to eat breakfast on the lanai each morning, it took away from the ocean sounds that we enjoy hearing.",Nov 2004,,,,"Milwaukee, Wisconsin"
2799723,50,The Whaler is Great (AND A BARGAIN!),"We really agonized over where to stay on our Honeymoon to Maui (Oct. 16-23) because we didn't want to pay the exhorbitant prices of the resorts, but we didn't want to have a bad experience on our Honeymoon. We did a lot of research and came up with the Whaler and we thought it was AWESOME!! We got a one bedroom suite with ocean view and it was huge (approx. 1100 sq. feet). The kitchen was fully equipped and we really enjoyed having coffee and breakfast on our gigantic, tiled, ocean-view balcony! We recommend driving down Front Street to Safeway, rather than buying groceries at the ABC store. If you have a Vons Card, they take it, and it's not as expensive as we expected. On the way, back, stop at Snorlel Bobs and rent snorkel gear by the week to save a bundle! Also, there was satellite TV, DVD, stereo, etc... in case, like us, you schedule your trip during the WORLD SERIES!!    The Whaler was in a PERFECT location. It took less than 5 minutes to walk to Black Rock Beach, where we found the best snorkeling around. We saw tons of fish and even a few sea turtles close to shore. The beach was not crowded, and had no trouble getting a drink when we walked up to the Sheraton. The pool at the Whaler is nice, nothing fancy, but we never had a problem getting a chair. We walked down to the other hotels, and while they had more elaborate pool settings, they were always crowded and a bit rowdy. We enjoyed the peacefullness at the Whaler.    Right next door is the Whaler Village where you can shop, visit the food court for a quick bite, or go to one of the three restaurants. Rusty Harpoons is great for football (they have every game on, so get there before they open to get a seat!), but the service is HORRIBLE!! We did not have even one good experience there (or at the Hula Grill for that matter). If you want to be treated well, skip those two places, and go to Leilanis. The service there was excellent (Go see Kate at the downstairs bar). And the food is great as well. Make sure you try the Fish Tacos at the downstairs restaurant.    Also, if you own a home and want to save a bundle, go to a timeshare meeting. We saved several hundred dollars and got to jet-ski, parasail, etc... We highly recommend the Blue Hawaiin helicopter tour. Spend a little extra for the eco-star helicopter and you will be totally comfortable. It's very stable, so it's not scary - it feels like you're watching an IMAX movie, and it's a great way to see the island.",Oct 2004,January 2005,,,Redondo Beach
2783902,40,Whaler Condos.,"Greetings, Just returned (10/23) from a wonderful ten days at Maui and the Whaler. This is our second stay at the Whaler and we've enjoyed the Whaler for the quality of the rooms, location, location, location. The only recommendation I would make is: Book directly with an owner or with the Whaler directly, i.e: make sure you know where your room is located. We had a 5th floor ""Ocean View Studio"" with a great view of the trees and ocean view from the deck looking sideways. Recommend 7th floor or higher to get above the trees on south side of bldg 2. All floors on south side of bldg 1 or north side of bldg 2 OK but you'll sleep with your drapes closed if you want privacy. Higher floors are better. Lots of remodeling taking place (almost finished). $7 per day parking and it fills up after 8pm. Don't swipe all the daily allotment of shampoos/soaps/etc or they will cut you off. Never a problem with deck chairs but shade areas around pool takes some trial & error in PM. Long time regulars get best spots under the tree next to pool. We'll go back, just won't book through travel agent, we'll know beforehand which room we'll be in.",Oct 2004,,,,"San Jose, Ca"
2779474,50,It keeps you coming back!!,"The location is perfect as Kaanapali Beach is right at your doorstep for those morning strolls on the beach or the evening sunset ones. Because of it's location, you can easily catch the sunset right on your lanai. The fully equipped kitchens enables you to enjoy any of your meals on your lanai with million dollar views for breakfast, lunch, or dinner at a fraction of the cost. Don't feel like cooking, no problem as the Whaler's Village is just a stone's throw away will excellent restaurants like the Hula Grill, Leilani's, etc.. Make sure not to miss the Hula Pie which is close enough for you to bring back to your unit to enjoy. It makes your experience at Maui No Ka Oi (the best)!! The experience is so grand that it brought us back everytime we came to Maui that we invested in a timeshare. Unfortunately they were doing the hallway renovations our entire 2 weeks this time but despite it, I still wish I was there!!",Oct 2004,,,,
2770192,40,One of the best place to watch the sunset,"We were in Maui from mid to the end of september, 2004. The weather was great, slightly windy, but it wasn't a problem. We stayed on the first floor, so the view wasn't as great. They were doing renovations, so didn't have lots of options. But the room was clean, kitchen had all the things we needed. (I don't think they change the sheets daily though). The hotel location was good. Close to the whaler shopping center, right by the beach. Everyday, we would spread our towels on the sand and watch the sunset! What a sight! The sunset is different everyday. Don't buy too much food from Costco if you travel in small group. Shop at Safeway in Lahaina instead. If you like to snorkel, drive north to Honolua Bay and snorkel there. The view is as good or better than Molokini. OVerall, we enjoyed our stayed in Maui very much. I would definitely go back there again.",Oct 2004,,,,"Ione, California"
2716990,50,I imagine I'm still there...,This was our 3rd time on Maui and the Whaler was the best place we've stayed so far. Stayed Sept18 for 1 week. We loved our ocean view 2nd floor unit that we booked with Vacation-Maui.com. (Don't book with Aston unless you have an urge to spend more money for no reason.) That main stretch of Kaanapali beach is the best. Our 1 year old loved the ocean there. We loved being a couple minutes walk from Black Rock as well. The convenience of Whalers Village right next door is great.    When I close my eyes I like to imagine I'm still there. I love the Whaler and Kaanapali Beach!!!!    MAUI IS THE BEST! (sorry Kauai and Oahu. Haven't done the Big Island yet.),Oct 2004,September 2004,,,"Vancouver, BC"
2614064,40,The Whaler made our vacation amazing!!!,"My husband and I recently returned from a week-long stay at The Whaler. It was amazing. The best thing about it is the location. You are literally steps from the most amazing beach in Maui, great snorkeling at Black Rock, restaurants and shops at Whaler's Village and just a few minutes away from the great eateries in Lahaina.  When we arrived, we were upgraded to an ocean view for a fraction of the price we would have paid if we had booked an ocean view in the first place. Our room was very clean with an excellent view.  Only two complaints...two days before we left they began to tear up the hallway for updates on carpet and wallpaper so it was quite a mess. But this means future guests will get to enjoy brand new decor! We were only slightly inconvenienced.  Secondly, The Whaler unfortunately does not have room service or a restaraunt since it is a condo, so be prepared to eat next door at Whaler's Village, buy groceries or find another place along the beach to eat.  Other than that, I would highly, highly recommend it for Maui on a budget.",Sep 2004,,,,"Seattle, Washington"
2507278,50,The Best!,"I am a luxury-seeker and thought I wouldn't be too happy in a condo but was I wrong! The oceanfront rooms are spectacular - the view just doesn't quit. The sound of the ocean is just as amazing and it lulls you to sleep. The lanai is the perfect place to enjoy the beautiful (already cut) whole pineapple they welcome you with at the Whaler. Right next door was the Hula Grill (great appetizers you can enjoy while wiggling your toes in the sand and sipping a cool drink). Also right there is the Whaler shopping plaza which was fun with cute stores. A stroll down the beach at night is incredibly romantic and all the hotels are right there on the walkway. You can go snorkling right there at Black Rock and see the incredible underwater world. Why would anyone stay anywhere else? Don't buy it that this is not a place for couples, it was romantic and one of the best places I have ever stayed and I stay at a lot of bed and breakfast inns. Loved it!",Aug 2004,July 2004,,,"Cypress, California"
2500863,50,Great Vacation!!!!,"We stayed at The Whaler from August 7-17, 2004. We were surprised when we arrived. They gave us keys for 3 different rooms to pick from. Two were the same price, one was an upgrade. We stayed with the one that came in our package, 12 floor, great oceanview, 1BDRM, 2BTH. It also had 2 pull down beds. We have 2 sons. They thought it was great!! As far as the kitchen, it worked out perfect. We went to Safeway and bought our food for the 10 days which was mainly breakfast & lunch and one dinner the boys can't go without, spaghetti, their weekly staple. The staff was very friendly & helpful. We walked a short distance on the beach to the Black Rock for snorkeling. Everything was in walking distance. The hotels & The Whaler Village has restaurants & a ABC store. We found some of the clothing prices less expensive than at home, so we did school clothes shopping! Lahaina is a fun place to walk around at sunset! It's just beautiful! We hope to be back next year!",Aug 2004,,,,"Foothill Ranch, CA"
2292511,30,It wasn't for us,"We arrived at The Whaler after spending three wonderful days on the relaxing island of Kauai. Immediatley we felt the area of Kaanapali was too busy. It took us the better of two hours to get there because of traffic. (There was still traffic the next day) When we arrived in Kaanapali we new it wasn't for us- the rows of high rise hotels and condos. (Was I in Fort Lauderdale?) The staff at the Whaler was very friendly and helpful. However when checking in we had to sign a slip indicating that we were aware of the dangers of the ocean as well as releasing the Whaler of liability for possible damage to our car. (Yikes) Nevertheless, the room was decent- a little dated but it was a condo. The other guests raved about the view but it was of the ocean if you looked to the right and a shopping plaza and other building in front. The bed was great and the staff left a pineapple, wine, and chocolates in the fridge. (Very Nice) However, we just didn't feel good about our one night stay and checked out the next am. As young honeymooners who like to relax and explore the island the Wailea area was more for us. The Whaler was not awful but it is not peaceful, luxury. The Kaanapali area is good for those interested in watersports and being active.",Jul 2004,,,,Connecticut
2284238,50,"Great Value, Fabulous Location","My husband & I are about to travel to Mexico, and I have found this web site so helpful I just had to post a review from our previous trip to Maui. We were there last Fall (Sept. 2003) for 1 week and neither of us wanted to leave!    -Room: We were on the 11th floor, 1 bedroom/1 bath oceanview, DO spend the little more required for an oceanview, it was the best part of the room! The balcony was HUGE, had 2 loungers plus a table with 2 chairs. We ate breakfast out there every morning watching the ocean, SPECTACULAR!  The room itself was 5 star by no means, but it was clean, updated and comfortable. Very spacious too, I was shocked, you'll never find a hotel room this big! Very large living room, dining room, and bedroom. Kitchen not huge but not small by any means, just your normal standard hotel bathroom with tub/shower. I could not imagine going to Maui and not staying in a condo, we easily saved $750 by making most of our meals! Maid service was great, kitchen had everything we needed. Buy your groceries at Safeway in Lahaina, much cheaper than Walmart.    -Beach: The Best! I saw a couple other posts that it was real windy, but we did not experience that at all (maybe the time of year, luck, who knows). The beach was beautiful and just right there! Not real crowded, we spent so much time here. The last day we were there wild dolphins came right up, and lots of us were out there swimming with them! This was truly the experience of a lifetime, but I doubt this is a common occurance. The snorkeling right on the beach was neat, lots of colorful fish right there. To the right is the Sheraton, snorkeling there was great, we saw 2 HUGE stingrays, fish of every color imaginable, etc all along the rocks there. The water on this beath is crystal clear, just beautiful. The waves were larger on some days than others. Never real huge, but large enough to have fun bodysurfing, etc.    -Pool: If the pool is really important to you, The Whaler may not be the place for you. Small, boring, but I could have cared less! I have stayed at 5 star resorts with huge elaborate pools and never even went to them. Personally the beach is where I go, I have a pool at home, but not the beach :). However, all of the hotels along this strip have pools that the public is welcome to swim in, you could always walk to one of them (not far at all). The Westin's pool is incredible.    -Grounds: The grounds were pretty and well maintained. We thought the coy pond was pretty neat, we could watch them swimming around from our balcony, just a nice touch. The foliage on all of Maui is just breathtaking, and The Whaler was no exception, gorgeous flowers, etc.    -Staff: We didn't really have a huge amount of interaction with the staff as we had no problems or anything, but everyone was quick to say hello with a smile, and very friendly during check-in/out.    -Activities: Definitely rent a car on Maui, we didn't find the traffic to be too bad, and it was real easy to find your way around, we knew the whole island by the time we left! (Note: $7 a day to park at The Whaler, but in an underground garage and we never had trouble finding a spot. Definitely worth the money to have a car though, we had the freedom to explore the whole island, it was great!    Haleakala (sp?) is a must! But go at sunrise, it is by far the best view, it will take your breath away! But you have to leave VERY EARLY, we left our room at 3:30AM and BARELY made it! It's also very cold that high up, wear jeans and bring a sweatshirt or something... Also beware that Haleakala is in a national park, and there is a fee to get in! We drove for almost 2 hours and almost at the very top found out there was a charge. We had no cash!!! The ranger was so nice, he paid out of his own pocket to let us in, truly appreciated!    The road to Hana is beyond words. Leave early, it is a full day trip! Get a road to Hana map so you know where to find all the waterfalls, and the black sand beach!    I'd also highly reccommend the Maui tropical plantation, the grounds are incredible and the tour was great! Some of our best picture came from here...    The Whaler allowed us to save so much money and exceeded our expectations, it was a great condo with an amazing view! When we return to Maui (hopefully for our 10 year anniversary) we will DEFINITELY return to The Whaler.    Hope this helps any of you still deciding...",Jul 2004,,,,"Saint Louis, Missouri"
2262823,50,The Whaler was great,"The Whaler was great. We stayed in a 1BR oceanfront (unit 451). The unit had an incredible lanai and view. The only minor complaint was that you had to jiggle the handle on the toilet sometimes to stop it from running.....sorry that's not that important in my book. The unit was very clean and well-kept. The staff was excellent, and took care of a rental car exchange after normal business hours for me. (Hertz replaced my rental car and dealt ONLY with the front desk staff) I had mentioned in my online reservation that we were arriving on our 10th anniversary, and they had even left champagne and glasses in the fridge. We thoroughly loved our stay and will be back as soon as we can!",Jul 2004,June 2004,,,"Houston, TX"
2221915,50,Will never stay any place else,"My husband and I stayed at the Whaler from June 6-13th, 2004. We had never been to Maui and used TripAdvisor and the Maui Revealed book (must buy if you are going to Maui) to plan our vacation. The Whaler was a great place to stay. When we checked in we were upgraded from a studio oceanview to a 1 bedroom suite for free! We felt like we needed to call our friends and tell them to pack up and come and join us because there was so much room in the suite. Two couples could EASILY stay in the one bedroom suite. While there we had excellent service from all the staff and security was remarkable. The maid service was great, the entire facility is very clean and well kept. True, it does not have the great pool area like the surrounding hotels, but all you have to do is walk next door to have the elaborate pool area. Honestly, we thought we would miss the huge pool area and being pampered, but we did not at all. It was nice to be in a quiet area and left alone. The location is great. There are so many places to eat (Leilahni's was our favorite). The grill area at the Whaler is great if you want to cook (go to the fish market and get seasoned fresh fish to throw on the grill). The kitchen had everything we needed, except seasoning. The first day we were there we went to Walmart (by the airport) to buy groceries, it was not worth it. Go to the Safeway in Lahaina (get a Safeway card for free and save tons of money). I could go on, but I think you get the idea- The Whaler was nice, well located, clean, great staff- we will stay there again on our next trip! By the way, the Whaler's website does not do it justice. They have done some renovations in the garden and grill area. We were pleasantly surprised, it was better than we expected.",Jun 2004,June 2004,,,"Baton Rouge, LA"
2200126,50,Put simply...Loved it!!!,"On September 16, 2001, my wife and I went to Maui on our honeymoon. We stayed next door to the Whaler at the Kaanapali Beach Hotel and thought it was great. A couple of years later a we went with a group of friends and stayed at the Whaler at Kaanapali. LOVED IT! We got a 2 bedroom ocean front and couldn't have been happier. The staff was nice and the room was clean. The lanai wrapped around the whole unit and the view was WONDERFUL!! I don't know that when we go back (hopefully soon) we would stay anywhere else!!!",Jun 2004,,,,"Nashville, TN"
2150557,50,Great place to stay if not looking for a grand resort.,"What can i say, we loved it. We stayed 10 days at the end of April 2004. If you are looking for a GREAT location with NON MEGA resort prices, this is the place. On our vacation we look for location and cleanliness, this had both. Located a few steps from the Whaler Village(Numerous shopping and eateries) and right on a beautiful beach. We had no problems with our stay so we rarely dealt with staff, only at check in and out. Our room was on the 11th floor with an excellent view of the ocean, black rock and mountains( i am guessing this was tower 2 as we could not see the other tower from our Lanai). The room was way out of date in decor, but this was our least concern. It was spacious and clean with a comfortable bed. The appliances were old but worked well. Parking was $7 a day and never had trouble finding a spot in the garage. The pool is small with no waterfalls or slides( If you want that, resort pools are public and they are a short walk from the Whaler ) The dates we were there, school was in session and kids were at a minimum. Nice Weber grills were located next to the pool. We did some grocery shopping and made sandwichs, chips etc for most lunches and grilled steaks one evening. The prices at the grocery were higher on some things (milk) but the same as in Ohio on most( deli meat, chips, cereal). We thought that eating out was no more expensive than eating at a nice restaurant in other major US cities.( your on vacation, live a lttle and have fun) We did Ruths Chris, Plantation house in Kapalua, Cheesburger in Paradise, Buba Gump Shrimp, Moose McGilicuty, most all in the Whalers village incl Rusty Harpoon etc. Obviously some were better than others but no complaints. Maybe we are not hard to please but this was a fantastic trip with no complaints. It rained one day on Kaapalua so we drove to South Maui and had no rain. Like i said if you are looking for a low cost condo with NO resort ammenities this is the place for you. Our cost with taxes was $220/night booked through orbitz and calling the resort and requesting a room on an upper floor for the view. Highly reccomdmended is the Book ""Maui Revealed."" We used this book numerous times for sight seeing, maps, restaurants, excursions etc. It was great.  Enjoy your time in Maui",Jun 2004,,,,Dayton OH
2117597,10,Avoid the Whaler until construction is over,"If you love hearing drilling above the sea waves, The Whaler is perfect for you. We picked the Whaler because Pleasant Holidays promotes it as the most tranquil spot on Kaanapali. For our first two days there, it lived up to that claim. But May 17th-21st, our tranquility was shattered by the Whaler's air conditioning renovation taking place from 7:30am to 6pm each weekday. This is going on through June 14 (and perhaps longer - you know how construction projects go), so if you have a reservation there, all I can tell you is to switch it NOW.    There are two towers, and of course we were booked into the tower undergoing the construction. But, in sharp contrast to the previous poster, we were never told in advance of our stay, we were never offered a room even *comparable*, let alone better than ours in the opposite tower, and by stark contrast to the Monte Fitts rep that poster dealt with, our Pleasant Holidays rep in Hawaii told us, ""it isn't our problem if there is construction at the Whaler."" Reading that previous post and learning how his trip was made better by excellent customer service on the part of his agent, it just makes me seethe even more at the horrendous service we received during our stay.    Unless you are booking it through someone you trust, I would avoid The Whaler for awhile. In addition to the construction, or perhaps because of it, we found the staff to be either apathetic or condescending - very unfriendly. Perhaps under different conditions (I read reviews at this site that raved about them) they are happier folk, but if anything, they seem to consider the guests an inconvenience, and probably would have been much happier had the Whaler shut down during this construction project. Believe me, we are in total agreement on that point.    Oh, here are some specifics about our room. We booked a 1BR, 2BA Ocean View non-smoking room, but upon check-in, the only acceptable ocean view room available was 912, a smoking room. We took it because the non-smoking room offered to us, rm 670, had a view of the opposite tower and was really rundown. Fortunately, 912 didn't smell too smoky. It had an incredible view of the ocean, Black Rock, and some of the mountains behind Kaanapali. The view was the best thing about the room, and we spent many evenings (after the drilling ended each day) on our lanai admiring the scene. The other positive things to say about 912 are that the showers were awesome, very powerful, roomy, and well-lit. The king bed was a dream - brand new pillowtop - VERY good sleeps each night. A CD player in the livingroom, a newer TV in both rooms, and a combo DVD/VCR in the livingroom (the DVD side didn't work). There was a mouthwatering, delicious pineapple in our fridge upon arrival. 10% Kona coffee was available in the room, but we went to Whaler's Village next door for the 100% good stuff. The washer and dryer was just two doors from our room, $1.25 wash and $1 to dry. We packed light, and made good use of the laundry facilities.    Now the negatives about 912: the carpet appeared about 20 yrs old, very matted and icky - we never went barefoot in the room. We moved one of the couches to make room for our daughter's crib, and found tons of crumbs and dirt underneath - it had obviously never been moved to vacuum there in the history of the room. The walls also badly needed a paint job, and there was one hole in the bedroom hall wall. The two couches were really old with some stains as well (we requested additional sheets to drape over the couches). The kitchen appeared surface clean, but I did a bit of Lysoling upon arrival so I would feel comfortable cooking and eating there. I suppose my thoughts are, if this is what a ""luxury"" condo room looks like, what do the non-luxury condos look like? If it weren't for the amazing view, the awesome showers, and the plush bed, I would have called it a dump, but those 3 key features carry a lot of weight, a lot more than carpets and walls.    I've read reviews here that rave about The Whaler, so we were obviously very disappointed. Maybe some rooms are a lot nicer and newly renovated, and maybe the staff is friendlier when they aren't being complained to all day by angry guests. Take your chances, if you like, but I'll never go back there again, construction or not.",May 2004,,,,"Concord, CA"
2117541,50,Better value than a Hotel......,"WOW !!!! We stayed at the Marriott in spring of '00.  It was a wonderful two weeks, so we decided to return for our Honeymoon in '02.  The Whaler provided all we had anticipated. We booked everything ourselves, flight included and we saved (my estimation) at least $2000.00 by staying at the Whaler. Costs of eating out every meal is high on Maui. The being ""at home"" atmosphere, while access to all that Maui has to offer. GREAT !!! The value is well worth it for stays of 7 nights or more. We stayed on the 7th floor and had a wonderful view of the sunsets and neighboring islands. Condo vacationing is the best for your $$$$$ and if Maui is your desired destiny, then The Whaler is for you, too.",May 2004,,,,Boston
1924718,50,1st-Class Service!,"We just returned from Honolulu and Kaanapali, and had an AWESOME time at The Whaler. As a side note, I have to mention that we rented the unit through Karen Kondo (works with Monte Fitts Reality and manages several units there) since she provided with 1st class service! There was some construction being done to the air-conditioning units that we were well-aware of in-advance, and Karen was kind enough to not only offer us attractive rates, but also to guarantee that our money would be refunded if the noise was too much of a distraction. Moreover, she also offered to move us into either different units or a different property if we were not satisified, so we agreed to booking the property. Well, to make a long story short, the noise was a bit too much for us when we arrived (we reserved a 1-bedroom studio ocean view), so we immediately contacted Karen. To our surprise, not only did Karen move us into another unit (in a different building) but it just so happend to be a 2-bedroom, 2-bath, Ocean FRONT (11th floor, 2000 sq ft) unit right on the beach! These units generally go for 3X what we were spending per night for the studio unit, but Karen just moved us right in and said, don't worry about it... you're rate will not change and just enjoy yourselves! Moreover, she personally called The Plantation Restaurant, made dinner reservations for us at sunset and made sure that we got a window table the following evening. Now that's what I call service!! Needless to say, we had a memorable stay at The Whaler and I would highly recommend working with Karen with regards to scheduling your future vacations in Maui. She's the best! You can contact her at the following website just in case anyone is interested: ---------------- The Whaler (in my sincere opinion) is one of the best locations on the island and the beach... well, Kaanapali is truly one of the nicest beaches in the United States!",May 2004,,,,"San Jose, California"
1791021,50,Exceeded our expectations!,"Exceeded our expectations!! Just returned from Maui and we would definitely stay at the Whaler again. When you visit Maui, you have two choices where lodging is concerned; a resort hotel or a condo. The resort hotel will typically have a nicer pool area than the condo, but the condo gives you a much nicer room. In Maui, who cares what kind of pool you have? We went to Maui for the ocean. I travel a lot and get tired of hotel food, plus we went to Maui with both of our kids. We stayed in a one bedroom condo at the Whaler and it was perfect. Our condo was absolutely gorgeous, obviously remodeled recently, with an amazing view from the lanai. A lot of folks who review the Whaler say it is the best value on Maui. Well, money isn't really an issue for us, and we would still stay there again! The entire staff was extremely helpful and friendly.",Apr 2004,,,,"Thousand Oaks, CA"
1785390,40,Slow pace in Lahaina,"We stayed at the Whaler. It was beautiful and perfectly located. I couldn't have asked for more. I took my 19 yr. old daughter. After 3 days she was bored and would rather have been in Waikiki. I suppose it's a more adult, quiet, restful, kick your shoes off type of place. I wouldn't have missed it!",Apr 2004,,,,"Exeter, Ca."
1684657,40,Terrific Location,"The location is terrific, but we found it a little pricey at in excess of $300 a day.",Feb 2004,,,,"Stockton, NJ"
1666095,50,in love w/ the whaler,"The whaler is by far the best value in west maui. If you want the best for a middle of the road price this is your destination, I recommend renting directly from the owners (vrbo.com) and shopping at wal-mart or safeway for your groceries. Save hundreds by making breakfast, lunch, and some dinners in your full kitchen. I have been to maui 16 times in my 36 years and have stayed at a # of places. Why not enjoy the other resorts ammennities (pools, restauraunts etc... but pay 1/2 what you would for a comparably sized room (studio) and have the flexibility to make meals and drinks next door at your condo. I would also only rent a car for maybe 1/2 your stay, taxi to lahaina for 6-7 dollars each way and arrive alive.",Feb 2004,,,,plymouth mn
1551098,50,Whaler simply the best for the price!,"We spent 11 days at the Whaler and found it to be the best value and location on the beautiful Kaanapali Beach. The units are nicely furnished with amazing views. The lanais are huge and tiled. Ours had hightop table seating for four, 3 lounge chairs and 2 small tables. We even slept out here one night listening to the sounds of the ocean. You are located right next door to Whalers Village for shopping,dining and entertainment. A short walk down the paved beach path brings you to the Sheraton and the excellent snorkeling at Black Rock. Nightime you can watch the torch lighting ceremony from your lanai. Walk down to the Hyatt for a romantic dinner at Swan Court or their Italian Restarant downstairs with dancing on the weekends. We really love this place and will be back.",Jan 2004,,,,
1498997,40,Over rated.,"The Whaler was nice, not fabulous. We stayed for 6 nights in November 2003 as part of our honeymoon. Our first mistake was booking directly with the owner through vrbo. As a result, we did not have room service (we would have if we booked directly). That kind of sucks when you are on your honeymoon. It was nice having a kitchen (small)--saved a lot of money by making our own frozen drinks, etc. The location is pretty good, next to Whaler's Village and the big hotels. The Westin has the best pool in Kaanapali. However, the best resort on Maui is The Grand Wailea--awesome pool and grounds!Kaanapali Beach is great--if you can actual lay on it. It was so windy, the only way to be able to enjoy it was to pay $30 per day for lounge chairs. We stayed our last night in Wailea--definitely the place to stay if you are going for relaxation. The resorts are better, the beaches are nice and you can hang out and swim (and snorkel) in them comfortably, and Kihue is a short drive for more down to earth dining, etc. We had our best meals near the airport (Thai) and the town of Paia. The food and prices were excellent. That was also an issue driving from Kaanapali--traffic is bad and it is almost 30 miles to the airport town. As far as those that complain about the prices in Hawaii, if you eat and drink in the resorts or Lahaina, of course it is expensive. However, you can get excellent food for a great price if you look.Our best bargain--if you are on a budget, get an entertainment card and stay at the Wailea Palms. Awesome one bedroom condos--flat style, incredible--with ocean view (over trees, road in front of you) and you get to use all of the Marriott's facilities for $143 a night ($128 plus tax). Awesome. We did not want to leave. Compare that to $150+$7(parking fee) + cleaning fee at the Whaler and there is absolutely no comparison!Recommendation--Before you spend the $79 per person on the Old Lahaina Luau, go to a less expensive one to see if you will like it. We went to the Old Lahaina, and it had the best environment, but was not worth our $$--we were definitely ready to leave and the food wasn't as good as we had in Paia.",Nov 2003,January 2005,,,"Pittsburgh, PA"
1372365,50,"Condo price, location, and service gets 6 STARS!","This was my first time in Maui, and we stayed at the Whaler for a week in April 03. We absolutely loved it. We were on the 11th floor, i think, and had a wonderful view of both the ocean, the Sheraton and black rock, and the mountains. A condo is definitely the way to go. We stopped at Walmart (only 2 miles from airport) and picked up many groceries for our stay. FYI--the Walmart also had many souvenirs that were the same as at the ABC Stores but cheaper!    The Whaler was right on the beach, has a guard at the entrance, and a beautiful lobby. Parking is underneath the buildings. They even have shopping carts in the parking garage to put your groceries in and transport up to your floor! The only problem with parking is if you come back late at night, the garage will most likely be full and you have to park in a separate lot by the guard station and walk but not too far to the hotel lobby.    There are picnic tables and bbq grills for families. The kitchen was small but definitely had everything you could possibly need. They left us a fresh pineapple and some champagne since it was our anniversary.    Although Whaler's Village is very close, I would not recommend eating at Hula Grill or Leilani's. They are very expensive and not that great.  Maybe one night there is all you need. Drive to Lahaina if you want to eat out. Some great bargains are at the Aloha Mixed Plate and Maui Tacos. I got coconut shrimp at the AMP for only $12 compared to $30 at Hula Grill & the AMP was much better. It is right next door to the Old Lahaina Luau so you can listen to the wonderful luau music while you eat right on the ocean. Maui Tacos is on the back side of a shopping ctr on the main drag. You can eat there or take back to your room. I got a chimichanga for only $4.95.    Next time I go to Maui, I will definitely stay at the Whaler again. The only bad part of our trip was we had some bad tradewinds and you'd get sandblasted on the beach, but we did so many other sight seeing things (hana, haleakala, snorkeling, volcano air tour, luau, ocean ctr) that we only spent a couple days on the beach....so it didn't affect us too much. Next time, I want more beach time and less sightseeing.",Sep 2003,,,,"Springfield, Missouri"
1258704,50,Fabulous!!!!!,"My 15 year old son and I stayed a week at The Whaler. We had a suite, 1018, which was perfect for the two of us. Great views, wonderful amenities, clean, everything smelled like fragrant flowers. From the marble bathroom to the wonderfully appointed kitchen, the comfy king size bed and the underground security parking, the friendly staff (thank you to our ever helpful smiling guard at the gate) and being right on the sand, not to mention within walking distance to the Whalers Village for great shopping and restaurants. A great sunset from the blue tiled lanai overlooking black rock, listening to the hula show from the Kaanapali Hotel next door. What a treat for our first trip to the Islands. Other nice touches included beautiful furniture, cable TV and a CD player. The staff left us a great gift basket in the kitchen which included cookies, 3 different types of local bread, fruit and a lovely welcome note. Daily maid service, hardwood floors, blender, microwave, dishes, glassware and a coffemaker. What a great place to stay! We upgraded our car to a jeep wrangler which was a blast and saved a lot on food by shopping at the grocery store in Lahaina. They even accepted my Ralphs card! Best place to get souveners was Longs and the Cannary Mall has a great indoor hula show most evenings (it's free). We drove the road to Hana, which you can take all the way around, even though it's a bit bumpy in some parts but it takes you through the upcountry and the Tedeschi Winery. Very relaxing, everyone was so friendly, not the clip joint island some folks talk about. I'm hooked, I'll be back. Mahalo Whaler Staff.",Aug 2003,,,,"Irvine, CA"
1257959,50,"Great value, great location!","We stayed at the Whaler in Ka'anapali for our honeymoon July 20-28, 2003. We wanted to save some money on accomodations by staying in a condo. What a great move! The condo was very well kept and comfortable, complete with a gold pineapple door knocker! We stayed in a 1 bdrm/2 bath and were upgraded to the 10th floor with a view of Whaler's Village, the West Maui Mountains, the Ocean and the Island of Lana'i.  Huge lanai, great for eating breakfast, reading a book on the lounge chair, candellight dinners, people watching at Whaler's Village during the day, listening to the faint sounds of musicians coming from Hula Grill...    The staff at the Whaler was friendly and helpful, and maid service kept our room clean. By the end of our trip it felt like our home and it was hard to leave. Right in the heart of Ka'anapali and just a short drive to Kapalua, Lahaina and South Maui. HIghly recommend. We will definitely return!",Aug 2003,July 2003,,,"Minneapolis, MN"
1129402,50,Loved The Whaler,"My husband and I and our 15 year old daughter and 8 year old daughter stayed at The Whaler on Kaanapali Beach June 12-18 of '03. The condo we stayed in was updated and had everything we needed, like a home away from home. We were on the 8th floor, with a view from the balcony of Whaler's Village in front of us, the Ocean to the right and the mountains to the left. It was spectacular. The beach was great. Very clean. Hotel staff were curteous and helpful. Maid service was also good. Would stay there again and again. We were going to go for something a little more secluded but now am glad that we didn't. The kids had alot to do with tons of beach activities. We visited different hotel swimming pools along the beach just to check them out. The Westin Maui definitely has the best pool of all the hotels along this beach, with waterfalls and poolside service. The best place to eat was a tie; the girls liked the Hula Grill and my husband and I liked Lelani's; both in Whaler's Village. There is so much to do here that you really don't need to ever leave. We did go sightseeing on Haleakala Mountain and Iao Valley. Both were breathtakingly beautiful with the Mountain being a long drive but worth it.",Jul 2003,,,,"Allen, Texas"
1122086,50,Wonderful Place to Stay!!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Whaler, and would not hesitate to stay there again. The staff was wonderful, and could not have been more friendly.

Actually, we bought a time share there because they have great rates and the rewards are priceless! The Whaler has a great location, right on the beach, and its conviently next to a shopping center. There are also many activities offered along the Kaanapali strip that include parasailing, banana boating, jet skiing, snorkling, trampeline jumping, etc. I've had a wonderful time every year and i expect the Whaler to offer nothing less!",May 2003,,,,"Providence, Rhode Island"
987955,40,Great Deal,"We have stayed here on two of our Maui trips. Our last trip was for our honeymoon- we were booked at the Grand Wailea for the first half and ended up leaving to spend our money a little more wisely (at the Whaler). We got a great price, because of our last minute arrival to the hotel- we had great service and great morning beach time (what else is important?). One of our favorite aspects of this hotel is the quick walk to our favorite restaraunt- Hula Grill. Ask for modern decor- this last time we stayed, the condo owner had just renovated floor to ceiling.",May 2003,,,,"Oakland, CA"
566550,50,Excellent Maui option,"I think the Whaler has much to offer. Great access to beach,activities,shopping and dining. No fancy lobby and blocks of hiking before you get to the beach or pool.If budget allows, the oceanfront units with wraparound lanai are fabulous (rent direct from owners to save $$). After dozens of visit to Maui my family agrees we would only stay at another property if it were an ""all-golf"" vacation.",May 2002,,,,
