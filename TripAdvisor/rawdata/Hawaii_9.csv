864042414,50,Family Stay with 4 kids aged 8-14,"It was our second time here - for good reason. The rooms are amazing with a brilliant location above the beach. You can't beat the stunning views and location with 4 kids. Just a minute walk from the beach. The kids loved the welcome water guns and drinks in the fridge - we loved the package of sunscreen and shell necklaces. I've done a heap of research over 6 trips to Hawaii, and your hotel ticks every box plus more and we will definitely return. One tip - we spent about $300USD on surf board rentals, only to find on our last day that you can get them for free at the other Aston (turn left out of hotel and walk to Aston). There was a massive room full of beach umbrellas, boards etc - you can borrow 3 for free each day!!! Would have loved to know this info at reception as would have saved lots of money. The other Aston Tower said they try to tell the receptions of all the Aston hotels that the service is available, but the info isn't passed on... a wonderful stay - we will be back :-)",Oct 10,September 2022,,,"Nelson, New Zealand"
792782700,50,Exceptionally Clean and Courteous,"We went as a graduation gift for my son. We stayed on the 19th floor in in an ocean front 2 bedroom suite. Words can not express how pleased we were. Our flight was cancelled so we had to readjust our dates and the staff helped do that with ease. Our checkin was very easy, they met us with cool towels to wipe down as they checked us in. Our car rental was not so generous and refused to keep our rental until the next day of our arrival so we didn't have a rental. That was not an issue, the staff arranged for shuttle when we decided to adventure out. I would request Rabbi Shuttle, this man was great. This is the cleanest place. The staff is constantly wiping things down, maintaing the garden area of the walk out to the beach. When we return to Hawaii this will be our first choice to book our reservation.",Jun 2021,June 2021,,,
863882038,50,Fantastic place to stay,The staff was amazing. They have an arrival fretting process that other places need to follow.    I highly recommend the Ocean Front rooms. The view is fantastic from the balcony.    The beach access is wonderful. They also have an outdoor shower on the path back.,Oct 9,September 2022,,,"Portland, Oregon"
861713421,50,The Greatest Place to Stay on Oahu,"See previous comments on how everything was PERFECT, from checking in to departure We were treated like royalty every step of the way, and all the wonderful extra amenities blew us away.

860814355,50,Would stay here again without reservation,"Lodging is the most important aspect of a vacation for me. This condo did not disappoint. The staff greeted us with leis, a welcome bag with water bottles, sunscreen, and cold lavender cloths with which to freshen up. I had called ahead and requested distilled water for my husband's cpap machine; two gallons were in the room upon our arrival at 10 pm. Thank you, Michael. Kalani was extremely helpful assisting me with a mixup for a breakfast order I made at another establishment. He also recommended a great restaurant near the airport upon my request. Each day, toiletries, laundry detergent, clean towels, and toilet tissue were replenished; beds were made and floors were vacuumed every day. Lobby staff made change for large bills (or vice versa) each time we asked. Valets were on hand 24 hours a day with no wait time. The oceanside view on the 18th floor was heavenly. I had read in some reviews in my research for this trip that Aston Waikiki Beach Tower's condos were ""dated"" and that the beds were too hard, the pool too small, but I thought the furnishings more than adequate. I am inexperienced in the workings of the hospitality industry, but I would think anyone would appreciate a reasonable price, a clean, spacious living area, a firm bed, and a staff who works hard to be friendly and professional. One would think that common sense dictates that constant use of a condo by thousands of people -- all of whom vary in their own level of cleanliness and respect for property -- would prohibit criticism of firm beds and ""outdated"" furnishings. Rather, it would seem one would be grateful for (1) an establishment who keeps its oft-used facilities in as good a condition as it does, and (2) an establishment who employs a staff who performs their duties and performs them cheerfully.",Sep 2022,September 2022,,,
859181058,50,"Love this place, and will definitely come back","Everything was great, welcoming, and friendly staff, excellent service, the room is amazing, great location!

859158608,50,Best hotel in Waikiki,"Top location, fabulous views from the deck. Great beach right across the street. Super friendly helpful staff, they all seemed genuinely happy to be at work. Welcomed with a lei, cool drink, cold flannel and gift bag of quality sunscreen products. Free valet parking is a huge bonus. Light and spacious, well equipped clean apartment, daily housekeeping. Pool towels provided in room. Good quality shampoo etc. Pool area with plenty of comfortable seating, gym, yoga studio, lounge area, billiards, BBQ and outdoor dining area. No inhouse restaurant or room service but not a problem with full kitchen and located near to multiple restaurants and quick dining options. Slightly noisy air conditioning but it helped block out the traffic noise of Waikiki at night which can't really be avoided. Huge bed in the master, 3 TVs, didn't need the sofa bed but looked comfy; kitchen had everything for self catering; washing machine and dryer with free Tide washing power supplied, and refills as required at no extra charge. A bit pricier than we would normally look to spend but worth every cent.",Sep 2022,September 2022,,,

856420383,50,Nice Trip with great view!,"Great experience! The staff are friendly and efficient, they gave us the kids beach toys and gift bag when we arrived. They also upgraded our suite from 6th floor to 27th, that's very nice, especially with the ocean view. The suite is perfect for family of 4 or more people. We have two bedrooms, dinning room, spacious living room and balcony. There's laundry machine too. Kitchen has almost all cooking ware and utensils. Very well equipped. Perfect for family with all the living needs. They have the pool on their 4th floor, with a jacuzzi. They closed their baby pool :( the location is great to visit the small Waikiki zoo and aquarium, alone with the pretty park in front of the diamond head. Only compliant is there are too many homeless people are in front of the beach area now. They dirty the place and view.",Aug 2022,August 2022,Traveled with family,Ask for higher floor for sure.

855952701,40,"Very nice, great location","A little pricey but traveling with a family this was well worth it for us. The full kitchen allowed us to shop and dine in. The location is ideal. It’s not a big fancy lobby with people and shopping everywhere. It’s slightly set back off the street. Parking was so easy, pool and gym are fine for the week. Views from full ocean suites can not be beat. Beds are a little hard, ask for foam pillows. Higher the floor — less city noice.",Aug 2022,August 2022,,,"Huntington Beach, California"

848448509,50,Wonderful Beachfront Condo,"We usually stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in the condos, but we were traveling with family who were staying at the Outrigger Waikiki and we wanted a condo close by. This place was perfect! For the money they paid for a one bedroom suite at the Outrigger, we got two bedrooms two bathrooms and a full kitchen! Not to mention free parking, tickets to several museums, gift bag with beach amenities and 24 hr concierge. Views from the Livingroom as well as the bedrooms were spectacular! And it was much quieter than the Outrigger. Would definitely book again.",Jul 2022,July 2022,,,"Torrance, United States"

845545909,50,Incredible,"I stayed at the Waikiki Beach Tower from May 26th - June 4th. This all condo property includes both units run by the hotel, as well as individually owned residences that can be rented. The entrance to the property is directly across from Kuhio beach, and the walkway is a covered trellis full of flowers, which then connects to a small lobby. The lobby smells amazing! I’m not sure what the scent is, but it is very inviting. For the first 3 nights of our trip we stayed in the hotel run part of the property. We were greeted with shell leis, and were surprised with an upgrade to a unit on the 31st floor, which we were walked to/through with a staff member. The staff at this hotel was so great and friendly, alohas and smiles every time we passed anyone. The 1200 sq ft 2bed/2bath unit was spotless, and the balcony views stopped us in our tracks as soon as we entered. We had no problems with a/c, or appliances. Housekeeping came daily. A dream stay.  The next 6 nights of our stay were in unit 1903, which was a private rental that we booked through Captain Cook resorts. Transition was seemless. There was so difference in hotel staff care, gym/pool use, valet service, beach towel sign outs, etc, no hassles whatsoever. 1903 was equally satisfying in regards to the condition of the unit. No issues. The only difference, was that we were responsible for our own cleaning during our stay (obviously).  I would 100% stay here again..can’t wait til I do!",Jun 2022,May 2022,Traveled with family,,
845361333,40,Great for big families,Love the location and the staff. Rooms and bathrooms were clean. Ideal accommodations for families.  It’s like stay in at home away from home.

845042456,50,Perfect for Families,"If you're looking for a place to stay that is reasonably priced, close to the beach, and has a full size kitchen, this place is for you. The two bedroom suite was perfect for our family with kids under the age of three.    Amazing service right from the minute we arrived. We gave our name, they were ready for us. Gave us she'll necklaces, welcome drinks, and wet towels. The front desk person walked us right to our room to show us around and how things worked and gave us a goodie bag with full size reusable water bottles, beach/water toys for the kids, and toiletries for the sun. Amazing! I've never felt so welcomed at a hotel. The main bedroom was beautiful, but the smaller room was less decorated. They also had bidets in both bathrooms. So fancy. I loved it!",Jun 2022,June 2022,,,"San Jose, California"
843785187,50,Can we stay longer!?,My family will definitely come back to this place. We tend to test different lodging facilities to see how we’d like the place and we’ve gone four times now and haven’t repeated a hotel. Now that we’ve stayed here we’re definitely coming back. You cannot beat the location and the easiest access to everything in Waikiki. The view was spectacular and so worth the money. Nobody wants to go home 🥳.

We arrived before check-in and they provided us a spot to park with our napping daughter, also got us checked in, valeted our bags and offered us access to their gym/spa area until our room was ready. Our room was beautifully adorned, well-equipped and offered breathtaking views of the Pacific Ocean and Waikiki Beach. We also loved the gym, pool, hot tub and how close everything was shopping, food and outdoor activities.

We could have lived out on the fabulous lanai, but there was plenty of inside space for me, my husband and our two adult children! Parking was also very convenient.

You get the most sq ft for what you pay compared to other hotels...and parking is free vs $40/night everywhere else.    The staff are very friendly and courteous. Shout out to cleaning staff and especially Umi at front desk for arranging the shipping of an item i left behind, going above and beyond.    Location is great, right across the beach and close to all the shops. Very clean hotel, and they provided our toddler with beach toys at arrival",May 2022,April 2022,,,"Toronto, Canada"

834070386,50,comfortable condo,"We stayed here for 4 nights. Booked through Aston, not VRBO. There are individually owned condos which are decorated as such and condos managed by Aston which are decorated more professionally. Ours was the latter and we were glad. Our friends had an individually owned room and the quality seemed lower overall. we paid extra for a high floor and got a little more than we bargained for. 33rd floor corner room.    Incredible views all around - beach to Diamond Head. Beautifully appointed condo - 2 bed 2 bath, nicely appointed kitchen. Was very comfortable and great to come back to after a hectic day in Waikiki.    The room was actual a bit too high for us though. We didn't use the lanai because it was a bit cooler and windier than lower down. The view was great when you went outside and looked down but the position of the lanai wasn't great. It was in shade whenever we wanted to sit out - morning or late afternoon and the lanai patio furniture wasn't the best quality. Our friends on the 10th floor seemed to have a better sit down view of the beach from their lanai and we liked that better. They were also on the middle part of the building that sits forward of the corner rooms.    The staff we very friendly. Valet parking was super fast and easy and included. Fitness room was great!    Amenities are practically none exisitng. The pool area is tiny and it was windy when we were there. We did not use it because of this. This truly feels like a condo and not a hotel experience. This is not a bad thing, just something to be aware of.    If you need space, are travelling with kids, don't need a good pool, want a fully functional kitchen, this is a great place. Lots to like here.    There are 4 rooms per floor - 2 on each side. There are corner rooms and center rooms. The center rooms sit forward of the corner rooms. Both have pros/cons. Rooms on the South side corner will have great views of Diamond head and beach right in front. Rooms on the North side will have views up Waikiki beach (if you are high enough). Corner rooms (ending in 1 or 4) will have wraparound views from inside the condo. Center rooms (ending in 2 or 3) will have possible diamond head all the way up to the end of Waikiki beach if you are on the lanai and high enough.    We owuld definitely recommend this property. We akso like the location, on the south end of Waikiki and it seemed a little less hectic than further up the strip. We like the beach location too. A little wider than further up the beach and good beach chair access.    Tip: go down by 8am to book your chairs/umbrellas for $60 for the whole day.",Apr 2022,April 2022,,Ending in 01 high floor room for great diamond head/beach views.,los angeles
833939888,30,Mixed bag,"I'm really torn on how I feel about my experience here. First I'll talk about room cleanliness- most of the room was spotless (and beautiful). Housekeeping actually did a very good job. But in the middle of this beautiful, clean condo... is an area rug that should be thrown away immediately. It has large, dark stains that made me not want to walk on it in my bare feet.    Then there's the air conditioning. It was there, but there were only 2 vents in the whole place and they were not very effective. I went out and bought a fan for the living room because I couldn't take it anymore.    And finally, the staff. The woman who checked me in, and most of the valets, were extremely friendly and helpful. But there was one valet who literally yelled at me for hugging my friend goodbye when I got out of my car; we weren't lingering- we exited the car, said goodnight and gave a quick hug and he yelled at us that we were in the way.    So I don't know if I'd stay here again. The view, the convenience of a full kitchen, and some of the staff members were really great. But overall I don't know if that's enough to make up for the rest.",Apr 2022,March 2022,Traveled solo,,Michigan

831075070,50,Location & Staff made the trip!,This was our first time in Waikiki so we were not sure what to expect. The Aston Waikiki Beach Tower was a wonderful surprise. The location is great in that it is just across the street from the tide pools so going to the beach was a breeze. It is also close to shopping and good food spots so it was easy to walk around and not have to deal with traffic. There is also one complimentary valet parking spot which was awesome since most hotels charge to park one car. The valet staff were super friendly and always available so getting in and out was not a problem. The welcome staff went above and beyond to make us feel at home. The check in and out process was seamless. The room itself was comfortable and a decent size for 6 adults. The kitchen had everything we needed from full size fridge and stove to microwave and rice pot. The room was serviced every day. We will definitely be back in the future.,Mar 2022,March 2022,,,"Irvine, California"

However, we decided to book here and the selling point was the full kitchen and the in-suite washer and dryer! Everything from check in to check out and valet was excellent. We had a 2 bedroom 2 bath suite for our group of 5 adults and it worked out perfectly. This is 1/2 block from the beach - walk out the front of the hotel, cross the street, and you are on the beach! Close to everything. Hotel itself doesn't have it's own restaurants but no worries - there are LOTS of options within walking distance and delivery galore! Everything here was super clean, organized and quiet. The building itself was quiet, but our room overlooked the ocean and beach, so at night the cars on the strip could get noisy, but did not detract from the other AMAZING aspects of this place!! Lanai stretches the whole width of condo and was large enough all of us could sit out there and enjoy Hawaii, the view, and people watching!!! Valet was excellent! I cannot say enough about this place I would definitely book here again!!!! BTW: Special shout out to Lyneth who was wonderful and acted like you were the only person in the building all the time!! Special Extra Shout Out to all of the Valet Guys - So Friendly, So Fast, So Nice (offering to take our pictures), So Patient all the time!!! Loved it. If you are contemplating booking here - book here -- WELL WORTH IT! Oh ya - how could I forget? Our party was greeted with a tote bag of water bottles and hand sanitizer and masks, etc. plus bathrobes to wear while there and slippers. I mean, come on, how much better can you get? Housekeeping came in daily and tidied up always so nice, too. I have zero bad things to say here.",Mar 2022,March 2022,,,"Appleton, Wisconsin"

829649385,50,Amazing stay! We will return.,"We had a great time at the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower. Our 2 bedroom waterfront condo was extremely spacious and well appointed. The beds were very comfortable (more firm than soft, which is nice) and all the employees were friendly and helpful. Bring ear plugs, though, the garbage trucks come early at 4:45 and they are noisy. Fortunately, that only happened a couple of days during our stay. I think that would be an issue at practically every Waikiki hotel unless you were on a very, very high floor. We were on 11. We would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family and we’ll stay here again the next time we’re in Oahu.",Feb 2022,February 2022,,,"Larkspur, California"

829515018,50,Excellent service and accommodations,"We stayed in the 2BR/2BATH premier condo in the upper floor. Absolutely worth the ocean front view. Staff is very friendly and professional and service was wonderful. Spaces condo, large kitchen, lots of closet space. No complaints. The free valid parking was very helpful, especially as we had friends visiting us who could also use the service.",Feb 2022,February 2022,,,
828257081,50,Would stay again!,"We recommend this accommodation. Excellent and friendly staff, wonderful location (though seemed to be more homeless people nearby than by other hotels, perhaps because the other hotels are surrounded by stores and the Aston is next to a McDonald’s), well appointed rooms, great ocean view, across the street from the beach. The valet guys are terrific. The hot tub is fantastic. Beach towels are plentiful. The bed was comfortable but since the air conditioning was so strong and the thermostat was primitive, it was a little cold and breezy at night. We stayed on the east end, and it was very noisy on the weekend nights because the Alohilani hotel across the street played music too loudly but fortunately stopped by 10:30 p.m. One potential improvement would be if the Aston could establish a beach chair and beach umbrella arrangement, even with a third party. We bought our own at the ABC Store for about $100 because we did not want to pay $60 a day per chair from the rental outfit on the beach. All in all, we would stay at the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower again.",Feb 2022,February 2022,,,

But a couple points for improvement:  -I booked directly on the hotel site, and didn't receive an email confirmation for eight days, although they took my deposit.  -Elevators not all operational, and the one that we were able to use had cracked flooring.  -Supposed to be non-smoking, but our neighbors were not abiding by this rule.  -Pool and Jacuzzi hours are 8AM to 9PM. We wish they were longer hours. It's nice to sit in the hot tub at 10 or 11 at night, after a long day of activities and a nice dinner.",Jan 2022,January 2022,,,"San Francisco, California"

824675586,50,Best place in Waikiki!,"The Aston Waikiki Beach Tower is a hidden gem. The place had everything that we needed and more. We were greeted with a cute welcome bag with some essentials for the stay, and the staff were courteous and friendly. Our 1 bedroom suite had everything. The kitchen was modern and had great appliances, even a rice cooker. Our lanai view of the beach was breathtaking. The pool area is on the 4th floor without much of a view, so we didn’t utilize it much. There was a small gym and outdoor area there too with a pool table for night time entertainment. We’ve stayed at the fancier hotels in Waikiki and definitely preferred our stay here. We will definitely choose this place for our next trip.",Jan 2022,January 2022,,,

From the moment I arrived and met Yumi, I felt taken care of. She was able to get me checked in early and to provide me with recommendations in the area.    I loved having a full kitchen and washer/dryer.    It is worth getting the oceanfront room. The views of the ocean were unobstructed.    The bed was also comfortable, and everyone at the hotel was extremely friendly.    It is right in the heart of Honolulu, so you can walk everywhere, though it can get a little loud at night.

Best place we have ever stayed in Hawaii.",Dec 2021,November 2021,,,"Boise, Idaho"
820428143,50,Great views and good for large family!,"I’ve been to Oahu multiple times before and prefer not to stay in Waikiki because of the crowds and how busy it gets, but we had a large group and it was first visit for many of them. I had been debating between Embassy Suites, Hilton Hawaiian Village, and other places. Overall, was a best decision to choose Aston Waikiki Beach Tower. Don’t get me wrong, it is more expensive but for good reasons. It was four adults and two babies, so the space was perfect. We had a full kitchen and washed and dryer! We also got upgraded from an ocean view to an oceanfront, which brought a gorgeous morning view from our balcony. Checkin was a breeze - and I’ve stayed at HHV before and it took almost an hour to check in - this was quick and staff was great. Parking was one of the best parts since we had a rental SUV for our big group - valet was included, we just tipped daily. Beach access and towels were great too, right across the street. I had also rented some baby items from a secondary vendor and it was delivered to our room by the bell desk and stored for us on the day we left until it was picked up.    Overall, really positive experience and would recommend to anyone looking to spend a little more for a hotel/condo style stay without the hustle and bustle of the resort life.",Nov 2021,November 2021,,,

818743135,50,Piece of Heaven!,"We reserved the 2 bedroom/2 bathroom Ocean view unit and it was definitely worth it! The unobstructed view from the huge lanai and the full window screen doors from the master bedroom provide an incredible view, whether it be unwinding for the day, or waking up to it. With some covid restrictions and inconveniences during our mid-Aug stay, the lanai provided a great place to dine in. The spacious living room and dining room, the fully equipped kitchen and washer/dryer made for an incredible stay. The hotel is more of a condo hotel, so it doesn't have the huge welcoming lobby. The lobby was quite small and undergoing renovation while we were there. The staff was incredible, providing welcome beach bag, with water bottles for all the guests, as well, as beach toys for the kids, and topped off with a box of chocolate. Tip: Make sure you get on a floor 30+, otherwise, there is another hotel obstructing your view.    Location can't be beat. While it doesn't sit on the beach, you walk across the street to it. There is also a hotel outdoor shower you can wash off before entering the lobby. The only downside to this hotel was the pool was on the 4th floor (I think) with most of it sitting in the shade during the day due to the building aforementioned above that not only blocks some views but also the sun. Not very appealing so we never used it, but being so close to the ocean, we preferred that to the pool anyway.    Lastly, the hotel also offered a communal A/C room to rest up and even use their showers while you're waiting for a later flight.",Nov 2021,August 2021,,,"Seattle, Washington"

810939501,50,"Amazing staff, great location, renovated rooms","I can't say enough great things about the staff here! From the front desk, to housekeeping, to the valet and bellhops, everyone was super friendly and welcoming. We were all given sanitation kits upon arrival, which included masks, hand sanitizer, and sanitizing wipes, plus a tote bag and complimentary water bottles. Masking is enforced throughout public areas of the hotel, and they ask for proof of vaccination when checking in.    Thank you especially to Regan for helping me with the check-in process when I was barely coherent due to motion sickness. The vertigo was so bad, I literally had to sit on the couch to limit head movement, and Regan was so kind and understanding—he took my vax card and ID, and walked back and forth to the front desk to help me get all checked in. Then he escorted me and my mom to my room and did a quick tour of where everything is. Thank you again, Regan!    The valet staff were all so patient with my giant family wanting to take out our cars, sometimes 2-3 times a day.    The rooms were also great! We had a total of four ocean-facing suites, and they were all renovated. The suites were spacious, clean, had a great view of Waikiki beach, and fully stocked with glassware, dishware, lanai furniture, and whatever else we would need for our one-week stay. The fitness center is pretty well equipped and clean--I was impressed. The pool is on the small side, but great for small kids. Plus, who goes to the pool when the beach is right across the street, anyway??    Only downside (and this is in no way the fault of the hotel) was street noise since oceanview also means street-facing rooms, at least for my one-bedroom anyway. My sister's and parents' two-bedroom suite, the bedrooms are in the back of the building and they had minimal street noise.    They're currently still renovating areas of the hotel so there was some construction noise, but it wasn't bad at all since we were out and about most of the time. My sis and I chatted about our stay after the fact and agreed we would 100% stay here again when we come back to Waikiki. Great balance of price, service, and location.

The location of the hotel is perfect, across from the beach with calm water for swimming and further out you see hundreds of surfers. Restaurants and fast food are just around the corner. The best value rooms are ocean front XX01 and XX02 for 180% view facing the ocean where XX is floor number, prefer floor 19th or a little higher for non-obstruction view.

Location was right in the middle of everything—everything from corner convenience stores that carry grocery basics to Hawaii-specific restaurants to McDonald’s to an international market within 10 minutes walking distance for high end shopping (Jimmy Choo, Balenciaga, Valentino et al.) and solid restaurants.

This was our second stay and the experience was even better    1. the location is great - beach is right across the street and the entrance to the hotel is tucked away in a side street -- the area is not the busiest or noisiest part of waikiki    2. the hotel is not as intimidating as some of other larger resorts - it truly feels like a home away from home. front desk staff are very courteous and helpful, valet crew is A+ and housekeeping is top notch. I have spent more $$ on fancy hotels in LA and San Diego and came away disappointed compared to what I saw here    3. the rooms are huge and only a few per floor - so it never feels super crowded at any point in time. The balconies are big, kitchen and bathrooms are nicely upgraded and everything works as it should    4.

Having a full kitchen made it easy to be COVID conscious and eat meals in. There are many tasty and authentic take-out/delivery options nearby as well. The staff are super friendly and relaxed.

We delivered our test to UPS early on Thursday afternoon and had results by 8:00 am Saturday morning. (Flight left at 6:00 pm on Saturday.)    We have been to Waikiki at least eight times before and could not believe how few tourist there were. Absolutely empty. (Probably 5-10% occupancy.)

778573216,50,Best Stay In Waikiki,"I have stayed at other places in waikiki, but this was my absolute favorite! The Aston Waikiki Beach Tower is in perfect proximity to everything that Waikiki has to offer. Waikiki Beach is a 5 minute walk (if that),and Kalakaua Ave (the main strip of Waikiki) is a 2 minute walk away (if that). The Aston Waikiki Beach Tower itself is in great condition. I did not notice any structural defects nor did I have any problems using any of the facilities. There were social distancing protocols in place. The protocols were not intrusive and quite easy to follow.  I stayed in room 2101 for 6 nights with my family. This was a two bedroom oceanfront suite. The suite totally satisfied all of our needs. The suite was immaculate, and everything was in perfect working order (despite there being written instructions, I couldn't figure out how to use the convection oven). The suite size was perfect for our family of 6. The suite and floor 21 was quiet, it never felt cramped, or as if we were intruding on each others personal space. The view of Waikiki Beach and the ocean was amazing!  The front desk staff and management were awesome. Very friendly, accommodating and helpful. I had a minor issue with one of the valet attendants. I mentioned the issue to the manager. The manager genuinely listened and apologized profusely. I was so surprised and pleased by the manager's attention to my issue, it literally warmed my heart.  If I had to stretch my mind to complain about something, it would be the entrance from the parking garage. I was told, by the valet, that self parking was on the 3rd and 4th floor. If you park on the 4th floor, you have to walk down to the 3rd floor to enter the building. (My room key would not open the 4th floor entrance)  Overall, I loved the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower. I highly recommend staying here. This will definitely be my go to place to stay whenever visit Honolulu.",Dec 2020,November 2020,Traveled with family,,"Mobile, Alabama"

I have stayed at many similarly priced hotels in other cities and never experienced this level of customer support.

Check-in was amazing, with a staff member personally escorting us to our condo and explaining how everything worked. On the way up, she casually mentioned that she saw we were having a special celebration so, if it was okay with us, she had upgraded our accommodation. Was it ever! We stayed on the 38th floor. The condo was large, beautiful, great amenities and had the most amazing view. We did have a couple of questions concerning the internet and tv. Maintenance came up immediately.

715538838,50,Great Location,"We stayed in condo 2302 and it was just as the pics showed. The furniture was comfortable and clean. This room has 2 bedrooms - king and 2 twins. There was a sofa sleeper, which could sleep another 2 people. It would not feel cramped if you had 6 people in this space. The views of the ocean and beach are stunning. I could sit on the lanai and never leave. But, of course, I did. The beach is located directly across the street from the building. There is a safe crossing at the corner. You can hear the noise from the traffic below, so that may be a problem if there are light sleepers.    The building offers free beach towels and valet service. The staff is helpful and friendly. There are only 4 condos per floor and they are located facing the Kalakaua Ave.    We had a problem with the plumbing, but the property manager and plumbers fixed the problem immediately. The issue and fix posed little to no interruption to our vacation.    The pool and jacuzzi are located on the 4th floor. Free towels are also located on this floor. During our stay it was very, very windy. So windy it caused little waves and back splash in the pool. It was breezy on the beach so I don't know if that was the problem or the funneling of the wind through the surrounding buildings.    The only thing I would change about the condo is the window shades in the master bedroom. They let too much morning light in room.",Oct 2019,September 2019,,,"Burlington, New Jersey"

708645221,50,Everything we hoped it would be,I had been scouting hotels on Oahu for several months before we booked. Places like the Hilton which I’m a loyalty member we’re just massive. Found the Tower with lots of great reviews and decided on it. The place is not inexpensive paying over $800 a night for a 2 bedroom on the 33rd floor. But was traveling with family and there are not many options for two bedrooms on or near the waterfront. Technically the Tower is not on the water but you are just steps to the beach across the road that is in front of the hotel. The staff was incredibly friendly from the front desk to the maintenance staff. Spent one week there and it was truly a great place to stay. Lots restaurants and shops within walking distance. The area is quite busy kind of like the Vegas strip without casinos. We had a full kitchen nicely equipped and actually had a good set of chefs knives. Our unit had a great soaking tub that was enjoyed each night after walks. Only disappointment was the number of homeless in the area that would cause some havoc from time to time. Last day there a couple of homeless got into a fight and one had to go to the hospital all occurred right in front of hundreds of tourists. Overall a great experience and would recommend if you can afford it.,Sep 2019,September 2019,Traveled with family,,"Cumming, Georgia"

691288286,40,Fantastic place only disppointment was the very unhelpful Kuhlani who manned reception,"· Location is perfect. 2 Bedroom apartment was very spacious and it was great to have a very well stocked kitchen with all appliances you could need and washing machine and dryer. Housekeeping staff were fantastic. View from the 29th floor over the beach was super, definitely worth the extra for an oven front apartment. Beach right across the road was easy to access and have a supply of free towels at the hotel was a bonus    · We arrived early from a long overnight flight from Australia. We had requested an early check in prior to our arrival. Although I was aware that it is never guaranteed I have always found most hotels are accommodating and do there utmost to get you into your room earlier than normal checkin. On arrival at Aston Waikiki we were greeted by a man call Kuhlani was very unsympathetic at the fact we had been up for 24hrs and our 3 children were extremely tired. He told us that checkin time was 3pm and we would have to wait unless we wanted to upgrade to another room. Having already paid $10,000 AU we weren't happy to do that. We went off for a few hours and had some lunch and came back at about 1pm as we were hopefully he may have found us a room. Again we were greeted with a 'check in time is 3pm '. So through exhaustion we sat in the hotel foyer to wait for our room. At approximately 2pm this same man asked my husband 'by the way are you over 50 years old"". When he said yes we were told that we were eligible for a room upgrade and therefore a room actually was available. We were then taken to our room which was on a higher floor than we had booked which was great. Unfortunately at this point we were thinking our stay at the hotel was going to be disappointing. Thankfully the rest of the staff at the hotel were lovely always greeting you when you went out or returned. Even the men and ladies at the car parking desk were extremely welcoming. Again the only person that never engaged with you was the same man that had checked us in. We were lucky that we didn't have to have much interaction with this person again, but he definitely didn't seem to follow the same philosophy of the rest of the hotel staff.",Jul 2019,June 2019,Traveled with family,,"Kew East, Australia"

The view we had was ""ocean view"" but it had a huge round hotel in front of our view, and for one night, we couldn't see the sun set at all. Bummer. I think the room was amazing. The internet for a gamer was great speed! But, we still weren't ""on"" the beach and the ocean view, to me, was just ok. For over $500 per night... I was a bit let down. I went to explain at the desk, and without paying more, there were no alternatives, bummer! I don't spoil myself often, so my partner was let down and he let me know it too. I could have paid an extra $150 and stayed at the Sheraton on the beachside. I guess the photos threw me off. The cold towels at check in awesome. My Tesla being left unlocked over night, not cool, it ran the battery down and we knew it wasn't locked properly. The pool, lovely, the hot tub super nice outside. A bit windy on that level. The street crossing not too bad. The outdoor view from balcony, bummer with that hotel in front, the staff, ok. No one did that above and beyond feel. Cleanliness of the room, found one hair on the bed sheet. The toilet, amazing auto toilet, loved it, the shower, needs a different shower head, can't move around, and the bathtub drain was broken we didn't complain, tolerated.

681107855,50,Perfect stay at Aston Waikiki Beach Tower,"My family and I had the opportunity to stay at the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower this summer and I considered this as one of the best places that I have stayed in. I was originally booked for a 2-bedroom apartment at one of the lower floors of the building but I took the offer of the reception for a higher floor unit for an additional fee. This decision is one of the best things that I have made for that trip.    The 2-bedroom unit is on the 36th floor and has one of the best views of Waikiki Beach. The unit has a modern feel with nice furnishing. As a service apartment, the room gets cleaned daily and all items (towels, bathroom amenities, and laundry soap) are regularly replenished. The master's bedroom share the same balcony as the living room and has a majestic view of the ocean. Waking up every morning with a spectacular view will perk you up each day and I highly recommend getting this unit. This might cost a little bit more than a standard 2-bedroom unit but it is all worth the price. One of our most memorable night was seeing a 30-minute fireworks display right off the shoreline. The staff are also one of the friendliest people that I have ever encountered.    Aston is only a few meters away from the beach and within easy walking distance to shopping and restaurants.

We used it almost every night. The lobby was nicely set up and it was a very short walk to the beach. The staff gave my kids snacks by the pool every afternoon. And they brought us chocolates and other little treats each night. They gave us boogie boards to use on the beach. We liked relaxing by the outdoor fire pits in the evening. We left feeling pampered... just like one should feel after a vacation to Hawaii. If we ever go back to Oahu, we will definitely consider staying here:)",Apr 2019,March 2019,Traveled with family,,

659385782,30,3star at best,Old property good location. Staff is likely to switch rooms on you. We booked a superior deluxe ocean front and were promised 30-35 th floors only to arrive and be offered 21 st floor or asked to pay to move up. We finally got put on the 25 th floor in a room with a broken window that made sleep impossible with the howling wind noises. They just stuck some wood planks to tighten the window. No apologies no changing rooms. Just gave us $25 off!    Location is very good but view gets blocked on lower floors.,Mar 2019,March 2019,Traveled with family,,"San Francisco, California, USA"

658475972,50,Weekend visit to UH with our son,"We chose this property because we wanted a condo with a full kitchen and wanted to be oceanfront in Waikiki in order to be near UH Manoa. This property exceeded our expectations. It was wonderful to cook breakfast in the kitchen and eat on the lanai with the ocean view. The location can't be beat, the service was excellent. The only negative is that the mattresses are extremely firm, which some prefer, I just don't happen to like it. My partner prefers a firm mattress and enjoyed it.    It's the best of both worlds; having a condo with the amenities of a high-end hotel.

654622442,50,breathtaking view and wonderful staff,"We recently stayed at the 34th floor premium ocean view room, had a wonderful stay, enjoying the sunset over Waikiki beach every day. And seriously, this place had the most attentive staff we've encountered in Hawaii!  - Location: go for the higher floors! Higher floors have the best location in Waikiki to watch the beautiful sunsets. I initially called and requested units with Diamond Head view, was a bit disappointed when I was assigned a Waikiki bay view ""03"" unit on arrival, but then I realized the bay view was actually amazing at sunset, with beautiful city lights at night! Diamond head view units do not have a full bay or city view. The tower is located at the end of the shopping district, so it's not so noisy at night, and just 1-2 blocks away to the heart of the high end shopping area, with tons (yes, tons) of eateries and stores within 2-4 blocks.  - the valet: I was initially a bit bothered by the valet only option, but they had the best valet staff! Very attentive, never rude or impatient, always a smile, and it never took more than a few minutes to get the car.  - rooms: very clean, including the bathroom grout! Kitchen was well equipped, all have 2 bedrooms and a living room. I think because of the large influence of Japanese tourists, their bathroom has a toto toilet (you know the one that welcomes you when you enter the bathroom:) and warm seat), kitchen has a top brand rice cooker, and PS3 had only Japanese instructions! You can ""rent"" (it's free) DVD or game from the machine on 4th floor. 4th floor also has a well equipped gym, outdoor grill, a small pool (this is Waikiki), and a hot tub.  It's not cheap, but we look forward to staying here again!",Feb 2019,February 2019,Traveled with family,go for the higher floors (premium ocean front),"San Francisco, California"

Considering we had a condo, the pricing was competitive with the other hotels in the area. Wonderful staff that made our stay most enjoyable.

The best rooms on the tower facing ocean are 02 all other rooms Upto around 17th floor face another hotel which looks into your room.  From 17th floor up rooms with 01,02,03,04 will have clear views.  Naturally I believe up to 17th floor will be slightly cheaper due to the low access to Ocean views.  The whole appartment was well equipped and the master bedroom faces the Ocean. With 3 children this room on 1102 was perfect for space with 3 tv’s linked to a android box allowing all of us access to thousands of programs over 3 tv’s.  The washing machine and dryer were the most used with our family of 5!

593754437,50,Perfect for families!,"Very family friendly! In room laundry, full kitchen. Great pool and hot tub. All high end finishes. For ocean view rooms, this is cheaper than any hotel if you have a family. This is far superior than 2 rooms at Royal Hawaiian or Moana surfrider (stayed at both). Basically, this has all if not more amenities than the Ritz, but is actually beachfront. The new renovations are amazing. We have come here for years and the old decor was good enough and worth the price. Now, it's another level above. I'd say 5 star level. It's almost too nice as I'm more nervous when the kids run around in the suite! There are only 4 units per floor, so it's not like staying at the Sheraton Waikiki where there are thousands of people milling around and elevator waiting (though they have a great pool for kids with slides even though it's crowded). You're not as worried about the kids running off at the pool here because it's a much smaller and private space. Also a plus, no fighting to reserve chairs or cabanas (which we've always had issues with at Sheraton, Aulani and other big hotels). This level of luxury is a total bargain if you have a group since you only need to book one suite vs 2 or 3 rooms at another hotel.    Also a plus, is free parking at a Waikiki beachfront hotel.

Like most other Honolulu properties The Residences are wedged among other properties. If you pay this kind of money for a room, stay as high as your wallet affords, though the value is not there at any level. There are many less attractive buildings surrounding and if view is important the buildings/ trees/ McDonalds will obstruct your view; particularly uncomfortable is sitting around the pool. The property has a structured, far east atmosphere. The apartments are small; much smaller than expected. The grills are very nice and clean; they need to be reserved and a great option since everything in Honolulu/ Hawaii is expensive. The employees are very friendly. A big issue: little kids/ babies taken into the hot tub and pool without diapers; no signage indicating health and safety concern.",Jul 2018,June 2018,Traveled with family,,Chicago

The second room out the back had views of the mountains and was normally quiet during the stay there, however when the trade winds hit - it made the room a like uncomfortable - but this was only for about an hour one night.

Daily room service was just great and nothing was too much trouble for the staff- from reception to bell services to housekeeping. They made you feel so welcome each time you came and went from your apartment. The view was amazing!!!! Not cheap but the ability to have a proper family holiday with young children and cook meals and do laundry as well as access everything available in Waikiki so easily by walking or trolley made this a dream holiday accommodation.

The condos are so spacious-ideal for a family or group of friends. We run the Honolulu Marathon every year and find it's the best place to stay as far as location-it's convenient to the start-the valet, Ed, always organizes our transportation to the race-via limo! We can walk to everything easily. The hotel is exceptionally clean, the housekeeping staff is fast and efficient. If you've rented a car the free parking is a major savings over all other hotels. (Wifi is free as well.)  We loved the renovations! Our condo was beautiful. Furnishing and flooring are new soft colors. Kitchenware and silverware service for 6, all new. You have a coffee maker, rice maker, dishwasher and washer/dryer-all the comforts of home! There is a grocery store within walking distance, however if you have a car Safeway or Walmart are within a mile or 2. If you don't want to cook, every type of restaurant from McDonalds (downstairs) to gourmet dining is offered within a few blocks. Delivery is available from many of the restaurants.  The 4th floor is gorgeous! The public areas, pool, grill and hospitality room are so user friendly. The pool and Jacuzzi are quiet, usually only a few people using either at any given time.  The gym is the best! You have every type of brand new equipment offered. On past visits I signed up for a membership at 24 Hour Fitness next door, since they've closed having a gym in the hotel is a huge savings and convenience.  The beach is directly across the street. If you run, you're steps away from Kapialani Park which is perfect for runners or walkers.

We had a 2 bedroom self contained condo for 11 days and moved into my sisters 1 bedrm nextdoor for the last night since she left the day before us.  Oh my goodness, the view was truly spectacular, we were on the 18th floor and the Circle Tower slightly obstructed a portion of the view but that was in no means to discredit it - just is so you are aware. We saw straight out to the beachfront and down the beach to The Royal Hawaiian/ Sheraton.  The sunsets from the lanai!!!!! Book here now you wont be dissapointed!  Straight across is the best part of the beach, McDonalds and the famous Eggs and things are underneath with ABC for all your regular supplies either side.  There was plenty of room in both places, the washer and dryer were great additions, as was the full sized kitchen with all the utensils, pots and pans you need.  The spa and swimming pool made for a great wind down time after spending a day at the beach before heading out for dinner, or cooking it in your room.  To top it off all the staff were a delight, they were kind, helpful and sincere. A special mahalo to Ed and Eddy, our favourite faces greeting us each day & night.

The maids replenish the shampoo, conditioner, lotion, paper towels, dish soap, laundry detergent, etc. every day.

500404176,30,Good location,"I chose this hotel based on the fact I wanted 3 beds. We had an ocean view suite with spectacular views. The room was adequate but rundown and in need of updates. Carpet by the dining room table was so worn down there was a hole. The kitchen worked fine. In the master suite that included the bathroom, there is no door to the toilet/shower area only a shower curtain. Also there was no fan in that area so after taking a shower the entire room was hot and uncomfortable. Since we were on the 29th floor we had to take the elevator. They were extremely slow and would go up to the top and come down with no one in it. Also have to share the elevators with housekeeping as they don't have a service elevator. Sometimes waited 10 minutes for an elevator. Right now there's construction on both sides of the hotel so the noise was disruptive during the weekday.

499791223,30,Nice staff - Bad property,"The staff at this property was amazing. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. They even had a welcome gift of sun care products and embroidered towels for us to keep. Very nice touch. Unfortunately, this staff has little to work with as this property has seen better days.    Location - Easy beach access and several restaurants steps from Hotel entrance. However, the oceanfront view from our unit was a tunnel view of the beach. Couldn't see to either side. We were on 16th floor, maybe penthouse floors would offer that panoramic view.    Room condition - The units was surface clean. However, the carpets were worn, dirty and stained. The furniture was quite dated and in poor condition. the appliances were literally from the 1980s and were damaged, had years of ground in dirt and were missing pieces. I didn't feel comfortable using them except to wash a few sand filled swimsuits. The cabinets were also from the 80s era but had granite countertops. ??? Very strange, but as I mentioned surface clean but don't look too closely. There was years of accumulated dirt and dust in the corners and on outlets, window sills, etc. The paint on the walls was touched up but with a paint that had a different sheen so you could see where they only painted part of each wall - just enough where you could see eye level.    Air conditioning - the thermostat control was an old fashioned dial that did nothing to control the temperature. It was either on or off and when it was on it got chilly. Especially for the people sleeping on one side of each bedroom where the vent blew right you.    Bedding - Beds were quite hard and uncomfortable. Not plush and inviting. The linens were thin and sparse. No blankets or comforter.    One final note, our unit did not have any hot water on the day we departed. We had an early flight with a full day of travel and it was not a great way to start the day with a freezing shower at 4am.

I like neat and clean so my expectations are high. I’m writing this review because of my husband who rarely complains unless something is really bad. He stated, “I did not like that place”.  PROS: First, the view from my bedroom was amazing! I loved waking up in the morning to the beautiful ocean view! Second, the hotel staff was really pleasant! Also, I liked the daily newsletter!  CONS: I read the reviews about the furniture being dated but dated doesn't necessarily mean it's in bad shape. However, as I was going up the elevator, I noticed the corners were not clean and from that I began to have a bad feeling...and I hate when I'm right! I stayed in room 2502, a Premium Ocean front room. Below are the issues with this room:  o Carpet – very dated and dirty, plus, there were no baseboards to cover up the uneven carpet cuts  o Kitchen - nice granite tops but the cabinets were at least 30+ years old. A cleaning with a product such as Murphy’s soap would help. At least 2-3 of the doors wouldn’t close. There was a nice range hood, stainless steel, however, it wasn’t clean, the microwave was clean on the inside but showed wear and tear on the outside, the rice cooker was just outright filthy. The refrigerator was clean on the inside, it too needed a stainless steal cleaner on the outside. The light switches were dusty and dirty.  Living Room:  o Couch – apparently quite old and used a lot because the pillows were flattened/sunken – uncomfortable – needs to be replaced  o Living room TV – though a flat screen, picture was unclear.  o Sliding doors – dusty and dirty in the bottom tracks  M/bedroom:  o Rattan Headboard – scuffed, broken areas, EXTREMELY dusty – needs to be replaced.  o Side tables – drawer wouldn’t close, extreme scratches, an area gouged out of the wood.  o TV – big, old, and gray...time for an upgrade  o Linens – a quarter size whole in one of the pillowcases and dirt on another – fortunately I bring my own.  o Carpet, old, needed cleaning, had the unfinished look, no base boards which showed the carpet cuts  o Wall plates – dirty/dusty  o When the A/C was blowing it was very, very loud. At times there was a strange smell emanating from the vent…  M/Bathroom  o Nice large closet – no base boards which showed the carpet cuts  o Two sinks w/granite counter top - nice.  o One of the sinks leaked  o When using the washer, one sink backed up with sewer smelling water  o Nice faucets – hard water shows calcium build up around the faucets  o Old mirrors, silver tarnishing  o Cabinets 30+ years old, needs cleaning w/Murphy’s oil, one of the doors wouldn’t close  o Wall plates – dirty/dusty  o Nice toilet – TOTO  o Shower doors – very flimsy glass  o Shower head – calcium buildup from hard water, very disgusting  o Gray shower mat – old, areas blackened with age  o Bathroom light – clean out the bugs  o Washer and Dryer was nice to have - the dryer had rusty areas on the inside  o The bi-fold doors had louvers – Extremely dusty and dirty.  o The bathroom vent was very, very loud. I asked that it be fixed…I was told it was but it wasn’t.  o 2nd Bedroom – had twin beds which was nice, however, it was always extremely cold, couldn’t adjust the temperature. The shower head in the second bathroom looked like it was white because of the calcium buildup. Wall plates need cleaning.  My analogy for this place...like putting clean clothes, such as the granite, on a dirty body.",Jul 2017,June 2017,Traveled with family,,"Saint Louis, Missouri"
498047065,50,"Jackpot, Grand Slam, Hat Trick, Gooooal!","This was one of the best vacations I have taken in quite sometime. And the bulk of that success was due to our stay at the Ashton Waikiki. I wanted to do something special for my wife, children and grandchildren (six in all). I was more concerned about them having a good time than me. From the moment we step on the property, it was first class. The high floor suite, the view, the beach across the street, the ideal location and a host of other advantages that made this a memorable experience. There were six of us and the only complaint I got was that no one wanted to leave at the end. I can go on about the amenities but you'll see for yourself. Nevertheless, I would be remorse if I didn't mention what made it special for all of us. It was the staff and it was genuine care and commitment to ensure a pleasant stay. From the house cleaning staff, desk staff to many other folks we encountered, they made us feel welcomed. So here's to Bob, Russ, Edward, Mary, Eddy, and all of you ... well done and Mahalo!

The location is convenient with bus stops and trolley stops nearby. We took the bus to Pearl Harbour, Diamond Head and Hanauma Bay and it is convenient (approximately 45 minutes to 1 hour bus ride from a nearby bus stop). The Honolulu zoo and Waikiki Aquarium is nearby and within walking distance. We enjoyed the evening walking along Waikiki beach to the shops and restaurants in the evening but it took roughly ten minutes one way to walk to International Market place.    One concern/problem that we encountered during our stay was our room key cards. Throughout our stay at the hotel, we had to swipe the key card multiple times for it to unlock the door into our room.

The location was ideal, our view of Waikiki was amazing and the two bedroom suite we occupied for 4 nights was perfectly wonderful. Originally we were delivered to the wrong hotel -- do NOT ask to go to the Aston, this property is known more by locals as the ""Beach Tower"" and it is a smaller property, but we liked that it wasn't a mob scene in the lobby or anywhere for that matter. The pool area was undergoing construction, but that wasn't an issue for us since our preference is the beach.  We did not have a rental car so appreciated that we could easily walk to the beach, nearby park and countless restaurants and shopping locations.

Yes, somethings are a little dated - the fold out sofa had seen better days and the refrigerator door had to be pushed shut. But, the overall experience was wonderful. Even on the 15th floor our ""partly obstructed"" view of the beach was fantastic. The full kitchen allowed us to have breakfast in the unit (on the oversize balcony/patio) Such easy shopping with the ABC Store just outside the front door meant we could run out to get more eggs - even in the middle of breakfast. The beach is the star and it was easy for the kids to grab towels before walking across the street to the beach. The pool was small but better than I expected.

The staff are great, only came across one valet who needs to find himself a new job out of the service industry. Nice refrigerated scented face towels to freshen up on arrival. Rooms are slightly dated , they are not totally old fashioned by any means, but they are not quite as modern as some others. In saying that, the rooms are very clean and well maintained. Rooms are serviced daily and staff seem to do a good job. The only real negative is the price, I realise you pay a premium for location but the price seemed a bit steep for what you get. I would like to stay here on our next visit but will shop around a little to try and get a better price. We stayed on the 25th floor in a 2 bedroom Premium apartment with completely uninterrupted ocean views. Overall if you want the latest greatest finishing touches and gadgets then look elsewhere, but if you are happy with nicely furnished, clean comfortable room with great view then definitely worth considering.

The dishwasher was actually broken, but everything else worked just fine.    The staff were really kind and professional. They gave us some freebies during our stay. The location is perfect, right next to the beach and the shopping district of Waikiki.    As with any Waikiki hotels though, the hidden charges were a bit ridiculous. In total, we paid $250 more for a two-night stay than we thought for ""amenities."" I get it, but haven't we already paid for that in our fees? That's only thing I'd warn for this hotel.

475636708,50,Fabulous stay!,"I'm writing this review while sitting on our amazing balcony. This hotel was everything we hoped for. Huge rooms, perfect location and the most gracious, attentive staff we have ever encountered in all of our travels. Free valet made hectic Waikiki easy. Rooms spotlessly clean. The only downfall was lots of construction next door which killed the quiet on the balcony during the day, but nice and peacefully quiet in the evening. Easy walk to shops and restaurants, loved Hy's Steakhouse for a special dinner. Across the street is the perfect beach, especially for kids since there is a breakwater to minimize the waves. We picked up meals locally and enjoyed lunching while admiring the view. (Try Rainbow Drive-In and get plate lunches to go) You might even have a birdie friend or two drop by to share your meal, we did. Pearl Harbor and other attractions close by. We could not find one fault with this hotel (and we are picky) and we have never experienced such hospitality as we have here.

My favourite thing would have to be the friendliness of the staff who are so welcoming and such amazing hosts I would never go anywhere else and have now been back 6 times over the last few years with a trip planned for July. In the next few years however I would love to see improvements on the pool.. despite not going to Hawaii to use the pool I do think that the quality of the pool is not what you would expect of a 4 star hotel. Despite the pool, this this is the best place to stay. Note- nobody should avoid staying here as a result of the less than average pool as the beach towers make up for it in many different ways.

Very nice, accomodating staff and manager. The customers were majority Japanese. I felt very comfortable here. The beds were a bit hard, but usually I was so tired once I went to bed I did not really notice. We rented a two bedroom suite with ocean view and loved it. You get a sunset view at night and can sit on the lanai and watch the beach traffic if you like. Once you check your car you can walk everywhere. Everything we needed was close by. They offer a turndown service with chocolates each night. The fridge was stocked with a few waters, coconut waters, and soda at check in. The hot tub is VERY hot. Very nice workout and BBQ area on 4th floor. You can check out towels for the beach at the bell desk. The rooms are very quiet. There is a single load box of detergent provided for laundry if you chose to do it. The manager brought us chocolates and champagne after check in. Later in our stay he dropped off two new hotel towels wrapped for travel. The staff accomodated our request to check out late due to red eye flight.

We are in and out of the hotel frequently; happily no huge lobby to trek through, but a lovely flowered portico, with an outdoor shower to rinse off after the beach. There is a laid-back feel to this gem which adds to the Hawaiian experience  - Parking is simply perfect. Average wait 2-3 minutes.  - Housekeeping never intrusive and would come at any time of day that worked for us.  - Excellent free WIFI.

We spent a great deal of time here - Not a full gym, but sufficient range of my favorites. There was also a separate room for stretching/yoga/spin cycles. Very nice lounge areas surrounding the pool and fitness centers.  - I believe this hotel is a condominium, so every suite has a different layout.

My husband & father in law loved watching the surfers, boats & whales in the mornings & afternoons from the balcony. It was the perfect spot to sit and relax with a drink.    The housekeeping did a great job and much to our surprise they even did our dishes while we were out. The front desk staff were superb and went above & beyond to help with everything that we needed.

People should understand this is one of those condo-hotel conversions where people buy units and then are able to put them on the hotel circuit. So, the rooms are renovated to meet the standards of the hotel, but are ultimately maintained by the owner (this is how I understand it).    We stayed in a 2-bedroom 2-bath on the 16th floor. Though it is a partial ocean view, we could see Waikiki beach, Kalakaua Ave. and an awesome VOG filtered sunset. Yes, we could also a few of the guests in the hotel directly in front of us and, from the bedroom windows, into the rooms of the hotel directly below us. But, we just kept the curtains drawn....

The views from the 14th floor are amazing, and the breaze was incredible.    The bad: Old, small TVs (tubes still, not flat screens), bathrooms felt very 1980s, road in from the hotel was busy and loud (not their fault, but it bugged me).    We got into the hotel finally at 4pm after a very long day of travel delays out of Dallas. Uggg. Honolulu traffic is no joke either. The front lobby is very bright and well appointed, and 3 ladies were on duty when we arrived. Super nice, super polite. They were aware that we were actually supposed to arrive the day before (canceled flight) and were apologetic we had so much difficulty getting to them. Check in process was very fast and we were given cool towels to refesh with.    The room we got was a suite - 1 king, 2 twins, plus kitchen & living room with pull out sleeper couch. It was very nicely appointed with a lot of storage. Would be great for a family. Our hostess that checked us in actually escorted us all the way to the room and showed us a bunch of the features. Little touches like the fridge has some coconut water, reg. waters, and mango sodas.    We opened the sliding doors and the breeze immediately hit us and was glorious! We left the doors open the entire time we were there except when sleeping because the noise from the road was too much for me, even 14 floors up.    The view from our balcony was amazing - we ate and spent a lot of time out there planning for our next adventure.    Towels are available at the desk to hed over to the beach with, and we took advantage and walked across the beach to spend some time in the water until a rain-shower drove us back inside.    There are a ton of restaurants and stores within walking distance of the hotel. The best ones we found were a 20 minute walk away from the beach - Uncle Bo's Pupu was great!

Had a problem with a Wi-Fi router in one of the rooms. Within 10 minutes, maintenance was up could not resolve in reasonable time, replaced the router and TV. Turndown service,daily room service and even though we did not have a car on Ohau, the hotel provided free Valet Parking. The staff's recommendations and knowledge of the area were very helpful.

402433907,40,1903 very good,"We rented through Captain Cook and had no issues. Even though not part of the Aston hotel, the staff were all friendly and helpful and willing to valet park and handle luggage. Just be sure to tip them appropriately. Unit was a bit dated but fine. Note that units ending in 03 have better views than 04 as they stick out further so offer a full view. Great having a full 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom apartment with kitchen, laundry, wifi and parking. Amazing views as right across the street from the beach. Floor 19 is high enough to have unobstructed views but lower floors would be blocked a bit by a small nearby hotel. A great location right in the heart of Waikiki. The pool area isn't anything special and only had a dozen lounge chairs but we came here for the beach so didn't bother us at all.",Aug 2016,July 2016,Traveled with family,,"Vancouver, Canada"
396092879,50,Great Place!!,"Our second visit to Hawaii and first stay at the Beach Tower. Previously we had stayed in resort style accommodation and with our kids now older we thought we would try a condominium to give us a little more room. We were not disappointed! We stayed in a 2 bedroom premium ocean view condo on the 32nd floor (3203). Views up and down Waikiki were sensational!!! Very well appointed with typical Hawaiian decor. Full kitchen so we could do our own breakfast of a morning which was great. Condo was very clean and serviced every day plus a turn down service in the evening. 3 TVs all equipped with subscription channels (included) and Playstation. WiFi in the room (nice and fast as well). Comfy beds and modern furniture!  Staff at Beach Tower are fantastic particularly the guys on the Bell Desk who were not only friendly but very helpful with everything. Beach Tower is more at the eastern end of Waikiki almost opposite the Duke statue and a short walk to all the restaurants and shops. Beach right across the road and a multitude of ABC shops right on the doorstep.  If you're looking for a great place to stay which is just a little quieter then the ""resorts"" then we would highly recommend Breach Tower.",Jul 2016,July 2016,Traveled with family,Higher floors are definitely the go for the best views.,"Yulara, Australia"

396008253,50,3602 via Captain Cook awesome!,"6 of us ( ourselves in our 50s, daughter and partner mid 20s/early 30s, daughter 22 and son 19 ) rented this unit via Captain Cook Resorts for 3 nights in July. It is privately owned so the Aston service does not apply. However the Aston staff on valet parking and front desk were helpful and willing to store our luggage when we arrived about 9 am well before check-in time. It is a pity we hadn't realised that as we had paid Paradise Transport and Luggage to store the suitcases at $ 5 per bag, which they did very well, but Aston storing them would have been even better. Our daughter and her partner arrived separately and in a rental car, so having free parking for the 3 days was truly awesome, difficult to obtain in Waikiki we understand.  Best points:. 1. VIEW! From 36th floor it is panoramic and we loved to sit out on the balcony( known as a lanai in Hawaii)  2. 2 bedrooms , 2 bathrooms, plenty of room , we let some of our young people use our shower so it was not 2 people for one and 4 for the other. The master bedroom and bathroom have the stacked washing machine and dryer in the bathroom, and a large wardrobe with 6 beach chairs, 2 boogie boards, 6 beach towels to borrow etc.Washing powder was provided.  3. Huge dining/lounge area with 6 dining chairs, good kitchen, we cooked in. Even had a rice cooker, had dishwasher supplies etc. We found it best to drive to a Safeway but there is also a Food Pantry in walking distance for supplies which we did use once.  4. Free wifi, very important, good TV etc.We did not find the condo dated at all, we found the decor very pleasant.A matter of opinion of course.  5. We found the pool area fine. Yes, the pool is a bit small- on 4th floor- but it is lightly heated, there is a very hot jacuzzi/spa pool which was nice in the evening, and nice loungers . Note the pool area is mainly shaded so do any sunbathing on the beach. It also closes 9 pm so you need to get that swim in after dinner before too late.  6. Free parking, as already mentioned.  7. I actually loved that it wasn't serviced because a private rental. We are all clean and tidy adults and it felt more private. It felt like a ""home away from home"" and we did not need the ""hotel"" services of bars, restaurants, maid service etc, and as a bonus with a private rental no ""resort fee"" as many people complain about in Waikiki.  8. LOCATION! Over the road to the lagoon area of beach, up north a bit further past Duke statue for waves, great shopping just by walking north up Kalakaua Ave, both high end( just for looking!) and cheaper like H&M. Good choices for the whole family.  Any downsides...  1. Aircon rather old and a bit noisy, so we didn't use it much at night but that was ok, could leave the doors to lanai open a little which helped.  2. Beds in master( king) and 2nd bedroom ( twin, used for our son and our daughter), were good, but our older daughter and partner found the sofa bed in lounge rather creaky and uncomfortable.  3. Elevators/lifts are a bit slow, only a minor point.

Everyone on the staff (especially Anthony) was friendly and helpful ~ always going the extra mile to make sure everything was good. The water and soda in the fridge was a nice touch as was the turn down service and chocolates each night.    The only area that keeps this from being a 5 is that the hotel is a bit out of date and could definitely use some updating although everything was very clean.

392740602,20,Disappointed,"Stayed here in room 2202 for ten nights with my Wife whilst on holiday on Hawaii.    The hotel is slap-bang on the Waikikki beach - the locations and views just don't get any better.    However, there are a number of important points for the owners to address:    1. The decor is dated and the room was very tired with worn/stained carpets, scraped/scratched walls, furniture and ornaments  2. The kitchen area wasn't clean enough throughout the entire stay and actually, it needs complete replacement. Floor tiles are chipped, the dishwasher is falling-apart & worn-out and there was food splattered on cupboards from the moment we arrived  3. Cleaning is also not thorough enough elsewhere with dirty extractor fans, grotty chair handles, spilled 'stuff' on the bedside tables and a dirty balcony mopped only twice in ten days complete with a coating of black dust (soot?)  4. The air conditioning is not so effective, especially as the thermostat for the bedroom a/c is in the lounge!  5. Turn down service is pointless: after taking a nap on our bed one afternoon it was left unmade (but had two chocolates thrown-onto it).    Photos are attached showing some of these issues.    These issues were brought-up with the front desk 2/3 through our stay. We were offered another room, but this seemed pointless as staff admitted all rooms are basically the same. Attention by housekeeping was also promised.    Unfortunately the room was no better when we returned the following afternoon: the same marks were on both the balcony tiles and bathroom floor tiles. In fact, there was no response until the day we checked-out.    The manager called us; he had been off on holiday. He apologised profusely for the lack of follow-up and for the issues raised by us. The apology was sincere. He explained that the apartments are privately owned and as such, refurbishment and replacement is down to the owners - though I don't think he offered this as an excuse, it was provided for context. He apologised too for the lack of cleanliness. We came to an agreement for compensation, but the fact is: we just wanted a clean room that reflected the price we paid.    Positives are:    • nice gift of champagne and chocolates for us on  arrival  • great front of house staff  • large rooms  • very quiet hotel (no banging doors etc.)  • good quality & clean linens and bedding  • good-quality balcony furniture and a huge balcony  • good TVs with lots of channels  • massive storage wardrobe  • fast, reliable WiFi.

My husband and I spent 5 spectacular days in Kona and finished our trip with one night in Honolulu/Waikiki. What a disappointment! We circled the block twice to even find the poorly signed entrance and then had to take the car around the corner to valet at a sister property and paid $25 to do so. The room at the Aston Beachside is cramped with only a small pathway to move around the king bed, which is hard and lumpy with four small, flat, hard pillows. The furnishings are not only hideously ugly but very old and falling apart. The balcony railing is too low and narrow so I was afraid to even sit outside for fear of falling over it. The view was only of a neighboring building anyway so no great loss. I felt uneasy and uncomfortable the entire time I spent in the room, which amounted to about 12 hours total. The only plus I can think of for this property is that the beach is directly across the street. But that can be said for several properties along this street so spend a little more and stay at a major hotel. This was an awful end to an otherwise fabulous trip.

There was also a stackable washer and dryer in the bathroom and they provided us with detergent so we came home with clean clothes, when does that ever happen? Speaking of the bathroom, the water pressure was way better than any hotel we've ever stayed in. We have hard pressure at home and always find it hard staying at hotels to get the shampoo and conditioner out of my long hair but not a problem here.

The kitchen and space for 3 kids ages 3,2,and 6 months to have to spread out was absolutely needed! I've never felt more relaxed with 3 kids in a hotel room than what I did staying in this hotel. It was a breeze getting to the ocean across the street and so easy to just run back up to hotel if we needed anything else. They supply beach towels at Valet desk which was nice. Also gave each child a bucket with toys for beach upon arrival. Staff was friendly although housekeeping a couple times was a little lacking. Umbrellas were there for use when it rained which was great too.Kids got to feed the fish while we waited for our bus to pick us up. Overall great hotel, nice staff-very helpful. I ordered some groceries from company that works with hotel and was delivered to room, which was great since who wants to go grocery shopping right when you get to hotel. So kids had the snacks and drinks they like, baby had food and baby water and adults had sodas and snacks and breakfast items all ready to go!    PROS- View and beach proximity is fantastic. Kitchen is great to have for kids. Never waited for elevator. Spacious rooms. Everything is close proximity from dinning to ABC stores to groceries. Endless supply of laundry soap and dish soap. Fully stocked kitchen. Water bottles, coconut water and mango soda stocked in fridge when arrived. We were up high enough to barely hear the noise from streets on a Friday night it really wasn't bothersome at all even when we were out on the patio at night time.  Overall everyone was willing and ready to be of service.Very fast Valet service- guys were all great and friendly.    CONS- Housekeeping was hit or miss. Both Showers/Tubs have sliding doors so it makes is difficult to have kids take a bath- Mine ended up just showering because it was too hard to bath them which made them mad because they like to take baths and play for a bit. King bed was a little hard and loud (not the highest quality mattress) when you rolled over but not too bad for a nights sleep after being outside all day. Couches and chairs were comfortable but could use a good cleaning or updating.    Overall this hotel is highly recommended if you have kids and are looking for that extra space and kitchen and love unobstructed views of the ocean.

359885416,50,Comfortable for families!,"Our family of four stayed here for about a week for spring break. We actually rented a condo from Captain Cook property management. It was fantastic! Busy part of town, but on 18th floor we did not hear as much of the street noise. Our views were great, though if we were higher they would have been unobstructed by the round hotel. However, the convenience to the beach and shopping made up for the little things the condo lacked. It is a little dated, but we had sufficient space for all of us. It was clean, and well kept. The beds were comfortable. Wi-Fi worked well. The kitchen was such a great thing to have so we did not have to eat out for every meal. The balcony was a great place to hang out in the morning and evenings. We will definitely consider staying at Waikiki Beach Tower, specifically renting from Captain Cook again!",Mar 2016,March 2016,Traveled with family,,"Leonardtown, Maryland"

353705025,50,Waikiki Waterfront at a discount!,We did find the 2 bedroom 2 bath to be a little outdated and not as clean as could be; however as soon. As we mentioned it the manager had housekeeping up to scrub a little more. We always wipe down our handles and counters and anything we may touch ourselves with Clorox wipes that we bring and spray all the areas with special spray to disinfect beds and couches so we did do that. Definitely out dated with the furniture but the view and the manager made up for that and then some. As this was our anniversary and our other couple had a birthday they were celebrating we each got chocolates and a bottle of champagne. The valet was professional and easy to get our car quickly. Would stay here again with the staff and how accommodating they were for our week there. If they would update the furniture in the rooms that place could easily bring in more money though!,Mar 2016,March 2016,Traveled as a couple,,
350638343,30,Mixed Feelings,"My husband and I with our two adult children enjoyed a two night stay at the AWBT last month. While I feel the service and location are second to none, it does need a bit of 'spit and polish'. Upon arrival we noticed the dated furniture, need for a little TLC and a bit of scrubbing. The suite however, accommodated our family of four adults with ease, but we unanimously agreed the beds were very hard. We had stayed at this property previously and found it quite noisy but I'm sure that was mainly due to the fact that it was high season (Christmas) and there was a lot of street noise. This time however, was perfectly quiet. My pet peeve with hotel bathrooms is the complete lack of ventilation - and this was no different .... no exhaust fan to remove bathroom odours and shower humidity. We loved the fact that McDonald's was at our doorstep. Perfect for grabbing a quick morning coffee and small breakfast. Were it not for the exceptional service I'm not sure I would consider staying here again. I feel there are probably hotels that are more updated, cleaner, and also offer good value - though likely set further away from Waikiki Beach.",Feb 2016,January 2016,Traveled with family,,Calgary
350139151,50,Loved the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower!,"After three weeks of travel already under our belts, we weren’t prepared to be blown away by our suite at the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower Hotel. To step into our room and see the stunning view over the beach to the front, then views of Diamond Head to the side, and views of the mountains to the south… wow! A generous balcony was furnished well, and we made good use of it. There was a full, well-equipped kitchen (which is far too often not the case in hotels); a separate dining area; a comfortable living space; two bedrooms – each with it’s own TV and bathroom. There was also ample cupboard space. The suite was very clean and well maintained. The customer service was of a very high standard – very friendly, communicative and welcoming. In particular, the doormen/valets were fabulous – we were never made to feel an inconvenience. Newspapers and newsletters we delivered daily, there was a complimentary beach towel service and a generous thank you gift was greatly appreciated. Access to the beach was directly across the road, there was a pool (but we didn’t get to see it – the beach always won out) and many restaurants/cafes nearby. We will sing the praises of the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower Hotel and look forward to a return visit in future. Worth noting – there’s a handy little coffee stall across the road for breakfast provisions, including pastries and a Haagen Daaz also across the road for late night treats!",Feb 2016,January 2016,Traveled with family,,"Melbourne, Australia"

Very impressed with this service.. also the small touches like chocolates and nuts being delivered in the evening before bed... and then the white towels to keep when we leave as a momento.  The condos are older but the views are amazing ... everything that you may require is in these condos. Our condo had been recently done up ..

341202482,50,1904 Waikiki Beach Tower,"Stayed 4 nights in Jan '16 in #1904    This condo was nice. The view was great. Don't get a room any lower than this or your view will be partially blocked by the building in front. Access to the beach was good because it was right at a stop light so you could get right across.    The manager Byron was helpful. We did have an issue with the clothes washer not working, but we only stayed 4 nights, so it wasn't a major problem.    All that being said, if we stayed here again we would choose a different room.    3 reasons:    1) rooms 01 and 04 on each floor are set back from 02 and 03. This blocks your view a little in one direction down the beach.    2). Rooms 02 and 03 have the master bdr overlooking the beach    3) This condo has carpet in the living room which means you have to be careful with sand when you come in from the beach. Some other condos (1903 for ex) have tile. This would be much better.    All in all, I have no complaints.

They were quick however to come and clean it up. Don't care for the fact that every hotel here charges you extra convenience fee for wifi, towels and free movies. Would rather they tell you up from how much the room is and not add in all these extra fees. Never watched a movie the entire 2 weeks we were on the island.

Five years ago, our unit was looking a little tired, and we were glad to see that they have refreshed the living room decor.    One of the main reasons we keep coming back to this hotel is the proximity to the beach across the street; ocean, bathrooms and rentals slightly to the right, a little ""bay"" beach with a covered area right out front, and a performance area that usually showcases local hula groups on the weekends.    Another is the staff. The bellmen and desk are great, and have been there a long time. Our cars were always waiting for us.    We also love the views from the balcony. Generally, there are 4 apartments per floor, with the foyer for 2 connected by an open breezeway to the other 2, so pay attention to your elevator bank if you are leery of heights. We try to stay in the 3 line (more Honolulu) above the 20th floor, as we like the views the best, but the 2 line is also fine (more Diamond Head).

It was evident that even the lanai is cleaned and swept so that guests are comfortable while sitting and staring at the prime ocean view this hotel offers.    The only thing I can think of to improve on would be that there needs to be a door entering the master bath. Anyone going and turning on the light while the spouse is sleeping is probably going to wake them with the brightness.

The valet actually smiled and made jokes, the check-in went very smoothly even with our fuddled minds! The staff had cold drinks in the fridge for us (YEAH!!) and we truly enjoyed having our kitchen, outside chairs for watching sunsets (or catching a few rays of afternoon sun). The staff was always courteous and very helpful with directions and recommendations for restaurants and activities.",Jul 2015,July 2015,Traveled with family,"Higher floors have best views!

292338636,40,Nice for a family of four,"We took our family of five to Oahu in July and stayed at the Aston Beach Tower which fronts Waikiki beach. These are all 2 bdrm condos, and, from what I understand, are owned by individuals and then managed and rented by the company. Our unit was on the 26th floor and had a beautiful beach front view. The balcony always had a beautiful breeze but the noise from the the main drag of Waikiki tended to reverberate off the walls of the balcony and was fairly loud.  The decor in our condo was only midgrade and seemed overdue for replacement with older furnishings and older carpet. The carpet had some stains on it and probably should have been cleaned prior to our stay. The mattresses were very basic and hard and the hideway sofa could only be slept on by laying at right angles to the mattress. It is not meant for an adult or even a large child as the metal crossmembers prevent any type of comfortable sleep. The bathrooms are fairly nice. There is a washer and dryer in the condo which is a big help.  The kitchen was very sparsely furnished with so few dishes and tools that we chose not to cook except for the most basic of meals. The dishwasher was old and the top rack could not be pulled out enough to put dishes in it.  The personnel were very friendly and professional and were a big help. There was daily room service and beach towels were always available at the entrance. The office personnel were always helpful and the main entranceway was super convenient to the beach. There is wifi which is okay and a pool and hot tub which we did not use as we spent all of our swimming time at the beach. They could really benefit by installing an exercise room with some treadmills and ellipticals. The only exercise option is a health club not far way that we were told costs $15/day/guest.  There are limited room options for families at Waikiki. We would definitely go there again especially if we had a family of up to four people. Five people, unless several are small children, do not fit very well at the Beach Tower.",Jul 2015,July 2015,Traveled with family,Try and get a room higher up with uninterrupted views of the beach,"Lynchburg, Virginia"
290965104,50,Fabulous week in my life,"We choose this hotel for our visit to Waikiki for our wedding and honeymoon. The staff at Aston Waikiki Beach Tower were very attentive during our stay, upon arrival we were upgraded and in our room was a lovely assortment of chilled beverages courtesy of the hotel. Although the furnishings were a little outdated, the service and location were 5 star. We were so close to the beach, restaurants and shops. Every day our room was serviced with clean linen and fresh towels. In the afternoons after our swim, we were also given fresh linen. I loved arriving back in our room each night to a little treat. We were spoilt on our wedding day with champagne and chocolates, and on the final night we were given a lovely taken to remember our fantastic week in our lives.",Jul 2015,July 2015,Traveled with family,,"Greater Sydney, Australia"

289660816,50,So nice to have some space after sharing hotel rooms with teenagers,"Ws finished off our 2 week family holiday with 4 nights here and it was soo nice to have some space after sharing 2 x hotel rooms with one of our teenage sons each night! Whilst it is an older property, it's location is first class for pretty much everything, beach, shops and restaurants. We were offered the opportunity to upgrade to a full ocean view room for 50% off the normal rate when we checked in. So glad we did as the view was superb and we were only on the 8th floor. Personally with teenage boys I was very pleased we weren't any higher! The staff on the front desk were brilliant, nothing was too much trouble, we checked in early and only had to wait about 15 mins for our (new) room to be ready. We are a family of 5 so had to use the sofa bed in the lounge which was apparently quite comfortable and as the 2 bed apartment was so spacious having he bed out all the time didn't really even impact on our space. Great to have a full kitchen, especially for breakfasts and 2 bathrooms was a bonus as well, not to mention a washer drier - definitely need by the time we arrived. I would have no hesitation in recommending this place.",Jul 2015,July 2015,Traveled with family,Full ocean view rooms are a must,"Auckland Central, New Zealand"
287484359,50,Perfect for a long family holiday,"We arrived for a 12 night stay on June 28th, this meant we were here for Summer break and Independence Day and ensured we had to be very careful with our choice of accomodation for in Waikiki.    Unfortunately the rapidly declining Aussie dollar coincided to create the perfect storm for us as far as rates go........so are pleased that we chose the Aston Beach Towers for our stay.    You will already have read posts about the awesome location, the breathtaking views and the spacious rooms on offer, so I won't go down that track other than say you won't be disappointed.    What I do feel is worth noting for families like ours (H & W, 13 & 12 year olds kids) is the benefit of the full kitchen and such a large, comfortable room that allows you the space for down time in between day trips and the endless activities.    To eat out in this part of the world 3 times per day for any stay over a few nights will cost you an absolute fortune, so consider paying a tad more per night to secure a condo over a hotel room, if you are in our situation it was normal for us to spend $150 - $200 (US) per meal with a drink or two.    At the Aston you have it all, a premium place to stay offering excellent service and the amenities that most hotels would dream about.    We will be sad to leave tomorrow and we really hope that our Maui accomodation is at the same level as this was.

283429381,30,Nice room but limited ocean view,"Rooms on the side have small (big enough for only one chair small) balconies and only from out there can you even see that there is a ocean just across the road. The elevators make you feel you are in some odd prison as you must first swipe your card, enter your room, wait for it to tell you which letter is your elevator then wait for that one to come get you. I guess it may be more efficient since those going to the same floor will be on the same elevator but during busy times like breakfast it is crazy. While I'm on the subject of breakfast while it is included in the bill, actually they charge a extra fee for the ""free"" WiFi, Breakfast and (actually a good thing if you got kids) free movie and game rentals. They also lock you into a $27/night valet service with no option to self park unless you find your own garage. Honestly Oahu in general is the least loved by my family of the Hawaiian islands we have been to, and this place contributed to that by making us wait 2 hours for our bags to be delivered to our room causing us to miss happy hour. The Tiki restaurant in the resort is about the only bright spot of our stay (I'll tell you about that in my review of their place so as not to tie them to this lack luster review).",Jun 2015,June 2015,Traveled as a couple,,"Harriman, Tennessee"

The kitchen facilities were great and having 2 bathrooms and a laundry made travelling with kids so much easier. The twice daily room servicing was exceptional - everything was cleaned thoroughly. All the staff were friendly, helpful and accommodating. We were made to feel incredibly welcome. Location was great. Beach across the road and everything else within a short walk and there is a main bus stop for the trolley services nearby.

269794472,50,5-star accommodations,"The Aston Waikiki Beach Tower is easily (and often) confused with a couple other Asten properties with confusingly similar names, and it's essential that you recognize the word ""Tower"" in the name of the hotel, located at the corner of Kalakaua Ave. and Liliuokalani Ave. Cars, taxis, etc. must enter the property via Liliuokalani Ave., making the official address on Kalakaua Ave. a little confusing (and two other hotels with which it is often confused also have Kalakaua addresses).  The 40-floor building looks like it was intended to be a condominium apartment structure, not a hotel. The units -- mostly 2-bedroom, a few 1-bedroom -- are amazingly spacious and well laid-out, all with large balconies facing the ocean. There are 4 units per floor and 4 elevators, so the wait time for an elevator is rarely more than a minute or so. Parking is free (almost unheard of in Waikiki) with a very efficient valet service, though the hotel's vehicle entrance can become jammed at times. The apartments are beautifully furnished, with fully-equipped kitchens and very effective dual-zone air-conditioning.  The staff is pleasant and helpful, housekeeping is proficient, and public areas (e.g., pool) are very will maintained. Because the property is so very much like a condominium apartment building, there are no restaurants, gift shops, or boutiques in the hotel -- which eliminates the congestion that such establishments create. Location couldn't be better. It is totally safe, directly across the street from Waikiki Beach, and with countless excellent shops and restaurants within a 10-minute walk. The daily room charge is augmented by an additional $25 amenities fee (becoming all to common at upscale hotels), and Honolulu's taxes on hotel charges are among the nation's highest. So, this is one of the more expensive hotels in Waikiki, but I think most people would agree that you are receiving what you pay for in terms of a high-quality hotel experience.",May 2015,April 2015,Traveled with family,"The view is partially obstructed for some units on lower floors, but the cost is adjusted...",California

You are looking right onto the ocean, you can keep your sliders open all night, go to sleep and wake up to the sound of the surf. You are right on Kalakaua Ave, 'the strip' of Waikiki, which I loved - I could go downstairs at 9pm and shop for a bit because everything was right there on our block. It's a ten min walk to any of the great places for dinner, no fooling with driving and parking. We got up at 6am, crossed the street, and the surfboard rental tables were open and ready for us.... 5 minutes later we're surfing in the Pacific. One morning I went across in my PJs to take pictures of my husband and daughter, I was back upstairs in 5 minutes! Less than five min walk each morning to any of the great coffee places there. It is noisy as you would expect, you have to decide if you are ok with that or not. Also, all places built on the beach were built a long time ago. If you want new (e.g. Trump) you will be a block off the beach. At least with this place you get a lot of space, a free indoor parking spot, a washer and dryer in your unit, and a full kitchen.

We were pleasantly surprised by the outstanding view and the size of this suite! We had paid the extra $50 for an upgrade to a premium room on one of the higher floors, well worth the money!! (We actually booked thru the hotel directly and got a great rate!). Our private patio was overlooking Waikiki beach straight on with no obstructions. It allowed us to sit and enjoy watching the activity on the beach, the surfers and see a beautiful sunset! We could even see whales spouting in the late afternoon. The maid service was outstanding, and in the evening we were always left a treat on our pillows at turn down service. The hotel supplied beach towels, chairs and umbrellas each day at no additional charge. With that and the free valet parking, it made the $23 daily hotel fee worth the money. There is a pool and hot tub with lounge chairs. It's not a big area and this is not like a big resort hotel, we did go in the hot tub one afternoon, but we came to Waikiki to go to the beach. The facilities are clean, it was convenient to have a full kitchen, with washer and dryer in room and the staff was outstanding! The location is right across from the beach with shopping and restaurants down the street in either direction.

If you want to surf/SUP, you can pass through the protected area also, no problem. The hotel is set back from the street so you miss the noise but you can see it all from your room if you go with partial or full ocean view. We got upgraded to full ocean view on the 18th floor and that made all the difference. The two bedroom with kitchen was huge (700 sqft). It had a large master with king and another bedroom with 2 twins. There was also a pullout in the family room which ended up being great as you could leave the patio door open and hear the ocean all night as if you were in the master. The dining/living room area was spacious and the fully-equipped (microwave, oven, stove, full-size frig plus everything you need to prepare and serve the meal) kitchen looked into both such that we could prepare food/drinks while conversing. The entire party can easily retire to the balcony overlooking Waikiki 180 degrees (we could see west to downtown Waikiki) and east toward Diamond Head. 98.5 FM for reggae on the Bose sound system rounded out the vibe. If you stay higher, you can probably see out to DH but no matter. If your not a sultan or a king, you won't be disappointed. The staff here is super accommodating and always put us first whether it be a maid to hold the elevator or valet (literally) running to get your car so you didn't have to wait even a minute.

The amenities have always been nice and are further improving with PS3 in every room with complimentary movies, games available. You get towels for the beach and pool but they haven't done the boogie boards in years because of liability issues (Shakespeare had it right when it came to lawyers).

We were just across from the beach and within easy walking distance of the shops and buses to get to Ala Moana. The pool was adequate and is obviously being upgraded but we managed to spend time relaxing there. My only tip would be make sure you are staying on higher floors. We were on floor 15 and that was good. I don't think the lower floors would have such a good view. All in all we had a lovely time at the Waikik Beach Tower.

Valet parking is part of the $22 per day resort charge, and our car was retrieved everytime within a few minutes. When we needed something, such as cleaners, salt, and water, someone showed up to deliver what we needed within 5 minutes.    The hotel is almost at the corner of Liliukalani and Kalakaua, separted from the beach by a street and two buildings. Facing the ocean, to the left front is a McDonalds, a nice looking low rise building. To the right front is the circular 18 story tower of Aston Waikiki Circle. The hotel has only 4 units per floor, all facing the ocean. Thus, the two units to the right (facing the ocean) are 1/2 obstructed by the circle tower up to about 18th floor. Above the 20th floor or so, all the units' vista become more and more open, with 180 degree views of Waikiki. We paid to upgrade to the 40th floor (the highest of 4 ""penthouse"" floors), and the view is scary grand. From our level, one looks down directly the beach, 400 plus feet down.    Our unit was somewhat dated but well cared for. The kitchen is old but functional. The living room large, the bedrooms good sized. I believe our unit was about 1250 sq. ft.

We were a family of 4 and wanted to finish our trip with a high end stay right in the heart of Waikiki. We were prepared to pay that little extra to ensure we had a great place in a central location. We were not disappointed. The staff at check-in were excellent and even escorted us to our suite on the 29th floor to show us through to make sure we were happy with the room. There was a supply of cold drinks in the fridge waiting for our arrival. After our drink we moved to the balcony What a view !!, We had a breathtaking panoramic landscape from Waikiki to Diamond Head which you never got tired of. Sunsets were spectacular They also have an evening turn down service where they offer clean towels and and a small snack. But the real bonus for staying here was the location. The longest part of the journey to the beach was the elevator ride. You at that close, directly across the road from the main Waikiki beach and you can pick up complimentary beach towels as you walk past the concierge desk who were always helpful. One morning the local area encountered a power failure and we had to walk down 29 floors to hit the beach and when we arrived at the bottom, the staff handed us cool flannels and a bottle of water. Just a small offer but greatly appreciated and demonstrates a level of customer service you can expect when staying here. We could not fault our stay here and would definitely recommend this as quality place to stay. On a side note we visited Honolulu about 7 years ago and experienced some excellent shopping at Ala Moana but were very disappointed this time.

The location is convenient being located just across the street from the banyan tree on Waikiki Beach and the price is right. I use Hotels.com to book my stays and this hotel is usually priced in the low $120/night. You don't get a beachview room for that price, but then who needs that on a business trip? Like most of the hotels in the area, the staff are very friendly and attentive. I only give this hotel a 3-circle rating as the rooms are dated, though management is making good efforts to improve this with new flat-screen tvs in some rooms and updated finishes. However, don't expect plugs for your electronics to be working all the time. They are so worn that they sometimes don't hold the plug very well.

We didn't cook in the end because there are so many great restaurants close by but it was great to have breakfast on our balcony while watching the surfers. Then down the lift, cross the road and we could join them. We had a couple of issues that needed sorting and they were dealt with so efficiently and speedily. All the staff made us feel so welcome.

237231838,50,Fantastic!,"Our family of four (with kids aged 9) stayed 5 nights at the Beach Tower in September. We booked a Premium Oceanfront 2-bedroom suite and we ended up on the 32nd floor. Check in was quick and easy and the staff on the front desk very pleasant and helpful. We were shown up to our room and were immediately blown away by the views from the lanai. They were incredible!    The suite itself was very spacious. The main bedroom had a king bed, with a massive walk-through robe and ensuite bathroom. The second bedroom had twin beds with plenty of wardrobe space and a TV. There was a main bathroom, full kitchen and large dining/lounge area. The lanai was a great size and ran across the lounge area and main bedroom.    The suite was very clean, although we found the previous guest’s leftovers in the fridge when we arrived. However, that was quickly taken care of. The bathrooms were quite out-dated and the showers were both over the baths, which may pose an access problem for some. The showers were also very slow to drain.    We loved having all the extra room and the full-sized fridge to store our supplies. We did not cook any meals, but having the oven to heat pizzas on the first night was very handy.    Our kids were given squirty pool toys upon check-in and they had great fun using them in the pool. We were a little worried before we arrived as we were told the pool would be closed during our stay. However, this was not the case and we enjoyed having the easy option of a quick swim in the pool after our days out and about.    My kids also celebrated their birthday the day before we arrived and once the front desk staff knew this, chocolates and sparkling cider were delivered to our room. It was a lovely surprise when we got back to our room.    We had a rental car the entire time and found the valet parking easy and convenient. It only took a few moments for the guys to retrieve our car and they were always pleasant and helpful.    The location of the Beach Tower is great as many a reviewer has previously mentioned. We loved being able to walk out of the hotel and be surrounded by shops, restaurants and the beach across the road. There were always many people around at all times of the day and night, but our room was very quiet. In fact, we heard no noise from any of the other rooms surrounding us at all. It’s always a plus when you don’t have to listen to the plumbing from the room above!    So, all in all, a wonderful stay at the Beach Tower on our first family trip to Hawaii.

237166181,50,Aston Waikiki Beach Tower - One Of the Best!,"I have stayed in a few of the popular hotels in Waikiki and by far this place is THE BEST! I need a larger room than the normal hotel room and saw this hotel on TripAdvisor. I booked through Priceline not knowing what to expect but knowing that Waikiki hotel rooms on the average are small and not cheap if you want to be close to the beach. Well, this place is right accross the strreet from the Beach.    When i arrived I was met by Ed at the Valet/Belldesk. Ed was a true professional and asked If i was checking-in and as soon as i said yes he knew who i was and addressed me by my name. IMPRESSIVE. How many hotels have people that look out for incoming guests and study thier names in preparation? That maybe common for the high rollers and rockstars but i'm far from anything like that.    Next, Ed unloaded our Mini Van and escorted us to the Front Desk where we were welcomed by Mary with cold towels and our keys. The check-in was so easy and quick it because Mary had everything ready for us presumably before we arrived. At this point I was very impressed with this place but it got better, normally hotels give you the keys and send you on your way, not here. Mary escorted us to our room and personally showed us around, how to use the safe/washing machine/ and sliding doors and everything you can think of. In fact throughout our stay Mary checked on us to see if we were okay, helped us out with booking a Luau, and made my kids very happy regularly.    The rooms here are big, we had a two bedroom, two-bathroom. This room can easliy accomodate six people easy since the living room couch folds out into a sofa bed. I found out that not all rooms ewere exactly the same but I can honestly tell you that there are no bad rooms here at this property. The views, the maintence of the property, and the staff are top notch.    The guys at the Valet are so helpful, they can give you directions and also give you some really good dining suggestions. They have a suggestion for any budget or taste. They proved that to me over and over. Thank You Ed and Eddy!!!!    Lastly, I have read a number of reviews of this place and if you have complaints about this place theres no helping you. Sure you can try and look for things to complain about and you might find something, it thats you, stay home.

We had our own private bedrooms and private baths, but yet we could all get together as a family to eat, watch tv, talk or hang out on the balcony sharing a beverage and the breathtaking view of Waikiki beach. I am so glad we chose the Aston. We searched the internet for many months before making the decision and were very happy with our choice. The location of the hotel was perfect.

This was the last week of our hectic 4 week USA trip. It was heaven. Planning accommodation proved tricky with the 3 children - but this was a winner. Yes $595/night is pricey but that was pretty much the standard in the USA if you didn't want the 3 child in your bed!  The manager gave us a tour of the room/advice on the area - the staff were VERY helpful.  There were 2 single beds in one room, a king bed room with ensuite, huge robe and washing machine and dryer (with free detergent - a welcome amenity when travelling with kids) A fold out bed in the lounge, a tv in each of the bedrooms (and lounge) fully equipped kitchen, huge balcony, pool and spa (not that we used it much) Complimentary parking for a car if you hire one and valet parking.  The minute we walked into the room - the view just blew us away - I spent a lot of time on the balcony!  The hotel is right out the front of the lagoon beach (opposite the duke statue) much quieter than up near the Surf rider etc and the beach is nicer.  Safeway supermarket is a $12 taxi ride away and plenty of shops with smaller extras. The main shopping street right out the front.  To get here from the airport we just hired a taxi van (fitted 5 people plus 3 large bags and 3 smaller bags) very easy to get at the airport.  The decor reminds me of many of the Queensland hotels - cane chairs etc. The apartments are not brand new flashy but very big and roomy with an awesome view.  There are plenty of restaurants very nearby - eggs and things very popular, mcdonalds at the base of the hotel but many more on the beach walk.

I was a little worried as I had read there were renovations going on - but we did not have any issues, we thought the apartment was fantastic. We used the pool which is not huge, but big enough and lovely, and when you have the beach across the road who cares!

227523711,30,Great Location and Beautiful Views (sort of),"After spending three nights at Disney's Aulani in Ko 'Olina, we moved to the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower for five nights. First, it was very difficult to find since the walk-in entrance is in between Eggs & Things and McDonald's restaurants, but no property sign to easily see. And, what is also confusing is that there is another Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel (not Tower) just down Kalapaua, so we kept going there by mistake. After several attempts, we finally figured out the drive-in entrance is on a small alley right after McDonald's between construction scaffolds.    Then, after checking in, we learned that construction on the outside of our tower meant we could not use the lanai's as they locked the sliding glass doors. We were never told this in advance of checking in and we booked this place six months earlier, so had we known about this, we probably would have gone elsewhere. After all, we paid good money for the beautiful Waikiki view, but had to settle to look through the glass. At least they compensated us by giving us a two-bedroom instead of one-bedroom, so that helped a bit.    The actual room is great with beautiful updated fully-equipped kitchen and Japanese toilets. The pool is modest and no one was there when I peeked as it was in the shade at the time. But, you can just walk across the street and go into effectively a salt water pool with the water breaks on the beach here. It is an easy walk to the zoo on one side and down by the various retain malls on the other side.    Service was also excellent with room service twice per day. I would have rated a 5, except for the poor communication regarding construction and lack of lanai access.",Sep 2014,September 2014,Traveled with family,,San Jose

Honestly it's worth paying the extra money for the convenience as it makes such a difference for your first time and for your stay. This hotel is central and is basically across fro. The beach. The views are magnificent and it placed in such a great location on the main strip kalakaua drive. The reception girls at the towers were accommodating and friendly especially Mary (or Mia?). The rooms are a little bit dated but from my understanding depends on the investor of the room because my mum and dads was different. The views more that make up for it and everyday we woke up to the surfers catching the waves on the beautiful blue Waikiki beach. There's a cute coffee shop across the road next to Haagen Diaz, especially if your looking for great coffee. I found the hotel great for my kid but then he's two-what would he not like? There was a pool and I think a games room on other levels but we didn't have time as there is so much to do! And why use the pool when there is amazing beach across the road.

211770849,30,Disappointed by lack of advance notice,"We paid extra for an ocean view and we did get that. What we didn't get was the use of our balcony for the week we stayed here. Apparently the outside of the building is being repainted, so all sliding doors to balconies were blocked off! Although no work was done on the Saturday, Sunday, or Memorial Day Monday we were there, we could only look at the ocean through the doors and not sit out on the balcony we thought we were getting.  The pool is on the front side of the hotel (where the painting was going on), so it too was out of service, locked off, and unavailable to us for the entire week.  The room itself was nice and the location is convenient, but it would have been nice to have advance notice that we would not get what we paid extra for, or even offered some discount to compensate for the lack of facilities we should have been able to enjoy.",Jun 2014,May 2014,Traveled with family,,"Lafayette, Louisiana"

About 10 minutes later the cider and some candy showed up. No matter where we went in the Hotel, any employee had a smile on their face, asked if there was anything they could do for us, etc. One time when I was riding up in the elevator it stopped on the third floor. An employee with a vacuum was standing there. He apologized for interrupting my trip and told me to go ahead, he would take another. When we were ready to print our etickets for the flight to the big island, another girl at the front desk (Mary) Took time out to go on line, took down the information and got them printed.

Staff were also very friendly and helpful and greeted us each time we went out or came back. Beach towels were available downstairs as well as beach umbrellas. Housekeeping came twice a day to clean and at night turn our beds down and left treats on bedside table. The place is a little old and could do with a upgrade, eg the shower was over the bath and had trouble turning it on each day. We found the beds very uncomfortable and the pillows just way to soft. TV's needed updating and the furniture was old and not very comfortable. Because two bedrooms units that are close to the beach are hard to find in Waikiki this was the main reason we chose this place.

205028493,50,"JOHN POND REVIEWS ASTON WAIKIKI BEACH TOWER APARTMENTS, WAIKIKI, HONOLULU","I am an Australian who recently stayed a month in the Waikiki area. Most of the time was spent in 5 star hotels. I try to visit Hawaii annually as quite honestly I love the place. I had always been impressed by the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower due to its excellent position opposite Waikiki Beach and right in the middle of the restaurant and shopping precinct. On my last trip I decided to spend a few nights there and check out the differences between Waikiki apartment living and 5 star hotels.    The check in process was as we expected from any 5 star hotel and it was very pleasant to be escorted to our room by an Assistant Manager who pointed out the features of the apartment.    Our two bedroom apartment had a large lounge dining area that led on to a very spacious balcony complete with outdoor furniture. The fully fitted out kitchen boasted a full size refrigerator, dishwasher, microwave, oven and cooktop plus many other culinary accessories. The drawers were stocked with plates, glasses, pots & pans, cutlery and all the utensils necessary.    Although my wife and I don’t do much cooking while on vacation, it was very pleasant to be able to stock up the fridge with breakfast and snack items. An excellent washing machine, clothes dryer and iron proved to be very handy. The bathroom had all the facilities and to our delight had the wonderful Japanese style toilet with the built in bidet and seat warmer.    The ever present ABC convenience store that seems to stock everything, was next door and a full sized supermarket was in the block behind.    There was a pool area which we did not use as the beach was a thirty second walk across the road.    Staff were very helpful and explained how to use the free internet and cable HBO movie box.    The apartment was serviced twice daily and was spotlessly clean.    Although there were only two of us, these extremely large apartments would be most suitable for families, as extra bedding can be provided if required for larger families. The extremely big TVs in the lounge and bedrooms, especially with their cable capability, was a big plus to me.    For the cost of staying at a 5 star hotel in a single room, one may enjoy the pleasures of spacious apartment living with all it has to offer.    The views overlooking Waikiki Beach and Diamond Head were exceptional and I certainly look forward to staying at this apartment hotel again in the near future.

Taxi was $42 from the airport and we had a two room apartment that slept the two boys in one room, us in the other and my daughter on the fold out couch. The apartments are older and haven't been re-furbed for a while but there is nothing to complain about.    Kitchen facilities perfect for an easy meal and we went out to Safeway to buy groceries for breakfast and lunches. The location is perfect and across the road from the beach so you can let the kids roam.    Rental cars are a 5 minute walk away and you can rent from Alamo/Enterprise for around $70 per day. Our apartment had a car park included so I rented an SUV for 3 days and we drove to Haumana Bay [20 mins?] and snorkled there for half a day. Note - rent snorkling gear in Waikiki for a couple of dollars and take it with you - saves spending $12 a set out there. Reserve a car in advance since when the Jap tour buses hit town - there are queues out the door...    The next day we looped the island and did the prawns [average] and Dole Pineapple place [no yearning to learn about pineapple so didn't bother going in... just ate the ice cream] all in a very easy day. If you are renting your car, do it only until 6pm as you will probably get it back to them in time and if you don't you can extend easily.

If there was a problem with anything the maintenance staff were there within 10 minutes to fix any issue we had.    Although the pool was closed this gave us a great opportunity to ensure we used the beach to its full potential and being right across the road was so easy to walk across at any time.

202638792,30,Beautiful property- unprofessional staff,"It's too bad that the staff here ended up leaving a bad taste in my mouth, because the property itself was great. A few friends were looking for a place to stay in Waikiki for a coworker's bachelor party. The party itself was taking place elsewhere but we didn't want to have to drive after and we wanted a place we could hang out for a little while before heading out. The price and size of the room seemed so much better of a value than anywhere else I could find. They're undergoing renovations so I'm not sure if the price has been adjusted to reflect that, but may have contributed to scoring a good deal. We booked a 2 bedroom premium suite. On the comments of the booking form, I mentioned we were there for a bachelor party, and if at all possible (depending on their occupancy) to place us in an area away from other guests in the event we got loud (just as a precaution!)    When we arrived, they were unable to provide a room with lanai access. There were warnings posted on the website that this may be likely, so we opted to upgrade to the 2 bedroom penthouse. As far as I know, it is identical to the 2 bedroom premium suite, just located on the top floors above the premium suites. The upgrade charge was reasonable, and after settling the bill, we were escorted to the room by a friendly girl from the front desk.    She showed us the room- amazing lanai, gorgeous ocean views, and even great views of Waikiki, downtown and the mountains through the bedroom windows.    We reiterated we were there for a bachelor party but wouldn't be on property for most of the night. She left, we cracked open a beer, and then our phone rang. She had told the manager we were there for a bachelor party (fine, we told her and I also mentioned it in the booking form comments). She said we would need to keep the noise down after 10 or they'd have to shut us down, and we said no problem, we're not going to be here until late to sleep.    A few minutes later, we got another call, telling us because we had upgraded to the penthouse, there needed to be an additional $500 hold on the room. WHAT??? We had just signed all the paperwork and talked about charges, taxes, amenities, etc and then been shown our room. And now that they had identified we were going to be a bachelor party, they freaked out and added a hold. I felt this was extremely unprofessional. If there had really been an issue, it should have been addressed at the desk. A $500 hold because it was on a higher floor than our other room? A room we had paid an upgrade fee just to stay in? I was furious, and had I been the one who spoke with the manager on the phone when he told us he was just going to put the hold through anyways, I likely would have told him to shove it and left.    Alas, we stayed (sort of, 2 of the 4 guys decided not to sleep there after all), they added the hold (which finally left my account 8 days after we checked out) and that was it. It's too bad, because most of us live here or are stationed here and often look for places to stay in Waikiki for special occasions where we want to be smart and not drive after drinking.

It slept the six of us comfortably with two kids on a sofa bed. Exterior of hotels is under minor renovations - the staff were very anxious that this didn't impact us and upgraded the location our room, gave us free towels to keep, toys for kids etc but the renovations only meant we could go on the balcony (not a big deal since I have a slight fear of heights and never use balconies). Great location on the beach. Although it is a big tower it has a low density of visitors since the rooms are so large - this is great since there is no wait for lift and the lobby is calm.

195987664,50,Most amazing holiday of my life!,"I went to Hawaii for Christmas 2012 with my family, it was honestly the best holiday I've ever had! This is a beautiful hotel, the rooms are so lovely! The breakfast is delicious, and loads to choose from. They give to a little cool bag thing to put all your breakfast in and take up to your room or to the beach/wherever which I found a little strange but I think its because the seats around the pool fill up so fast. The room we stayed in had a view of the ocean and it was so breathtaking to wake up to in the morning! On New Years Eve we could see all the fireworks from our balcony, and some people were on their surfboards in the ocean watching them.    The activities we did while we were there, we went up Diamond Head which is a must, the views are amazing. Whilst at the top we met a man called Mitch Berger who does 'Guides of Oahu'. We arranged for him to take us on one of his tours the next day and it was a really good experience. He takes you all through the rainforest and he knows literally anything and everything about Oahu and he is so passionate about it! We also went snorkelling at Hanauma Bay which is amazing!    As the hotel is right on the beach front, it is in excellent location for all the main shopping areas and restaurants.",Mar 2014,December 2013,Traveled with family,,United Kingdom
195271862,50,Perfect location for a family or group getaway!,"After reading all of the other glowing reviews here, we decided to try this hotel for the first time.  After many trips to Honolulu previously, we had decided that for this trip wanted an apartment and this one certainly exceeded our expectations.    The apartment itself was very spacious with more than enough storage for all of our luggage and (large amounts of) shopping finds.  Having a full kitchen cannot be raved about enough and it was fantastic for breakfast plus the occassional ""bitsa"" meal after a long day of shopping and sightseeing.    We opted for the premium ocean front condo and recommend this highly. The views are simply lovely and worth the extra bit you pay for them.    The pool and spa were being reconditioned during our stay but with Waikiki beach just across the road this didn't bother us. We also loved being across from the sectioned beach-pool areas which are great for young families and early morning paddle boarders alike.    We used our spacious and well furnished lanai several times every day. It's a wonderful spot to relax and take in sounds of the ocean and the sights on the streets below. One sport we loved was watching the comings and goings of planes (don't worry, the noise was minimal if at all) and also spying cruiseships entering and leaving Honolulu harbour.    We were in town at the same time as the Pro Bowl on this trip (unplanned) and were lucky enough to walk thorugh the block party happening along Kalakaua Avenue. With all the bands and people around we wondered if the noise would carry to our balcony. It didn't bother us at all as some music was present but not loud, in fact we had a great time watching all the goings on from there until they packed everything up shortly after midnight.    The beds were very comfortable for our family group of 3 adults and 1 child. The kitchen contained everything we could ever need from cutlery and crockery to salt and pepper (how cool!) and coffee, the latter being replenished daily if required. The turn down service at night was an added bonus with towels changed and a delicious little snack provided too.    The housekeeping staff have a good eye for detail and our unit was always very clean and well provisioned. We didn't need to ask for anything in this department but I am sure if we did, it would have been provided promptly and with a smile, as with everything else!    The staff were wonderful and ever helpful, even calling our airline for us to organise things when we needed some help. A special shout out to Yasu and Russ who really looked after us during our stay. You guys made us feel so welcome and always greeted us with a warm and genuine smile. Thank you!!    We had a car for a couple of days during our stay and the complimentary valet parking was fabulous! For those reading and wondering what the catch is... there is none. It's convenient and on the premises so no need to wait for ages to have your vehicle delivered.    Location wise, this building is located at the eastern end of the strip. Still close enough to be a short walk to anything but far enough away for those who don't like to be in the thick of it all. We actually prefer to be in the thick of it and were concerned that this might be a bit out of the way but we loved the location.    There is a Waikiki Trolley stop just across the road and buses out the front and to the street behind, depending on where you are headed. Nothing is too far away. There are also a number of ABC stores of various sizes very close by for grabbing your supplies.  For groceries, there is a supermarket not too far a walk from the hotel on Kuhio Avenue (one street behind and a couple of short blocks along) for a larger shop.    Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed out stay here and although the building is not new and there are some signs of wear and tear, the condos are well furnished and appointed, clean and very spacious. We plan to come back again!    Thank you for a wonderful stay! :o)",Feb 2014,January 2014,Traveled with family,Premium ocean front is our choice and recommendation.,"Sydney, Australia"

The accommodation was massive; we could happily have lived there, 2 beds, 2 baths, lounge, dining area and modern well equipped kitchen. The hotel is having some renovation which we knew when booking so access to lanai's was restricted. This didn't impair the fabulous view though and we experienced no building noise as work was scheduled to start after 10am when residents had left and end prior to 4pm.

We were very lucky to have been allocated a 01 Corner Suite (on 21st floor), with amazing views all around  My review may have been different had we received an 04 room - unbeknown to us the Tower is undergoing some major renovations, and everyone in the 04 rooms were unable to access their balconies.  The balcony was a MAJOR factor in our choosing this hotel so we would have been extremely unhappy if this had been the case.

188231892,50,"Fantastic staff, great location, undergoing some renovation","We booked two separate stays in the past two weeks here as part of our vacation to Hawaii. We found out ahead of time about the renovations, so were prepared as the notices said lanai access might not be available. Our first room, the 2BR premium ocean view, we had no problem. This hotel is in a great location across the street from Waikiki. The rooms themselves could use a little renovation (in addition to the outside work they are doing). Nothing major, just starting to look a little tired. This room had some really old TVs (like 10 years minimum), which isn't great for that early Sunday football watching.    What really stands out about this place though, is the staff. Everyone works super hard to make sure your stay is fantastic. I wish I wrote down names, but from the desk, to valets, to housekeeping (extra towels? No problem. Supplies? no problem), everyone seemed to bend over backwards to help.    The lack of pool access isn't a problem, unless you absolutely have to have a pool. This one isn't that big anyway, and there isn't much at the pool level other than that pool and a deck. I'd rather be on the beach anyway.    Concierge helped with some golf reservations, beach towels were plenty.    The second time we stayed, we requested a late checkout, as we were flying back in the evening. The staff juggled some things, so we got a partial ocean view with restricted lanai access because of the outside work, but we got the late checkout we wanted, with no extra charge. It was almost like getting another day of vacation. Again, the staff at the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower is as good as any place I've stayed, any where.

187924775,30,Disappointed after previous stay,"Okay, I must have been really spoiled on my first visit to the Aston Beach Tower in 2009. We had booked a ""2BR partial ocean view room"" and must have been upgraded to a ""2BR Premium Ocean View Room"" as we were on the 32nd floor with views to die for (Diamond Head to Ala Moana). The furnishings were modern, super luxurious and the whole experience was incredible. So........ when planning my 60th Birthday trip with husband, 2 brothers and 2 sisters-in-law, I recommended we stay at the same property. I booked back in March 2013 - a 2BR Deluxe Ocean View plus a 1BR Deluxe Ocean View and requested the ""highest floor possible"". One week prior to arriving we were contacted by our Travel Agent to inform us that the hotel would be undergoing renovations on the outside only, which should not cause any disruption to our stay. They stated that the renos ""may"" mean that we might be in a room without access to our lanai. While I wasn't very happy, it was too late to find an alternative property. However, upon arrival, we were then informed that we would not be able to use either the pool or the jacuzzi during our stay! While the Aston staff insisted that they had notified Wholesalers and Agents of the renovations back in September, we were certainly not advised until November about the renos and certainly not about the closure of the pool. Well, we were already there - what could we do? Then came the disappointment of the rooms! While we had requested (back in March) for a ""highest floor possible"", we found ourselves on the 12th floor, with a little view of the ocean directly in front of our lanai, but mostly overlooking the rooftops of the buildings on both sides and putting up with the noise of the air conditioners on top of the Pacific Beach Hotel next door. We did however have a great view into the Rooms of the Aston Circle Hotel in front of us! It was entertaining watching what other travellers get up to after dark with lights on and curtains open! The furnishings in both rooms were dated, tired and in need of a good re-furb. Coffee tables, chairs and TV cabinet all needed a coat of varnish, and the TVs were all the old tube-type. Not a flat screen to be seen. Needless to say, after the incredible experience of my first visit in 2009, I was disappointed and embarassed that I had recommended this property so highly to my family. There was no apology from Management, no offer of change of room, and certainly no offer of a partial refund for the inconvenience of no pool. I guess I equate it to paying a premium price for a dozen large free-range eggs, only to discover I'd only been given 10 cage-raised small eggs for the same price!

It was just the two of us on this trip, so they locked off a bedroom/bath for our 1 bedroom reservation - so it felt quite large for just us. The lanai had seating for 4-6 people and a full size table with lounge chairs and wrapped the length of the bedroom through living room.

181681112,50,Great condo!,"We stayed here August 14-21, 2013 and we have no complaints! The location was great because we weren't down in the very crowded shopping district and the beach access was great with actual shoreline which isn't the case for a lot of hotels on the beach. The condo was huge; we were traveling with two teenagers and one used the bedroom and our other teen used the pullout in the living room. We did not use the kitchen to cook but it is nice to be able to store your snacks, drinks and food with full size appliances. We shopped at an ABC and kept snacks, drinks, and other food which saved on restuarant spending in between meals. Having the washer and dryer was great because we were able to wash a few loads of clothes. The hotel replaced detergent each day and they don't charge you. The patio wasn't a little dinky balcony, it is a real patio with full size furniture and fabulous views (I think all,of the units face the ocean). We really didn't need to buy anything for the beach; the hotel gives you towels, umbrellas, or whatever they have in storage you can use and bring back. The hotel itself is not crowded with people (waiting on elevators, etc) and very laid back. The staff was very courteous and friendly. If you are traveling with kids or other family members and don't want to be stepping over your luggage and belongings in a cramped hotel room, it is worth the extra cost to stay in a condo!

It's a huge benefit to be able to cook meals and do laundry in your own room, no waiting in a stuffy laundry room.    -Turndown service: Every night a housekeeper would come by the room and ask if we needed any anything at all from extra towels to laundry soap, and would leave us a little goody to eat. The kids loved seeing what the treat would be.    -VALET: YES the Valet service is THAT good!! They were so welcoming, they knew our name even as we pulled in to check in, we had stopped at Costco on the way in for some needed grocery items, and they said hop out of the car, go enjoy and they brought not only the luggage but all of our groceries to the room.

CONS:    I had to get really nitpicky to find anything worth complaining about, so here goes, yes the building is older, some wear and tear is evident in places, but overall a very well kept property.    The pool is very small and offers no shade, we attempted the pool only once and it was a tad chilly for the kids, but wanted to give it a try at least. However, we did not go to swim in a pool, we were there for the ocean so this didn't bother us at all.    Overall, the beds were comfortable, the furnishings were pleasant, loved that the elevator only serviced 2 rooms on each floor, and the elevator is fast! The lobby had a very pleasant smell walking in, and there were the most beautiful flower arrangements inside. The koi pond in the valet area made the kids happy as well. We could tell you all the reasons we loved our stay at the Aston, but you should really experience it yourselves!! In my opinion the Aston is one of Waikiki's best kept secrets and we will only be staying here on future trips to Oahu! Impeccable service team and a killer view!! A big thank you to everyone at the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower for helping make this the best vacation to Waikiki EVER!",Sep 2013,August 2013,Traveled with family,,
173094174,50,Great front desk team - What a memorable week !!!,"I spent a week at the Waston Waikiki Beach Tower late in May and early in June this year. It was a memorable week. What a great place to stay ! Location is fantastic, the views from the oceanfront rooms are breathtaking, the double bedroom with kitchen makes you feel home and the entire staff of the hotel cannot be more friendly. You are so close to everything: beach, shops, restaurants, etc. One of my best memories of the Aston Beach Tower will be exactly the staff at the front desk. Amazing guys ! Yasufumi Koga (Yasu) and the girls were awesome. My evaluation to the hotel during my stay: 10 stars. Triple AAA. Thanks guys for making my trip with mom something so special.

170370054,30,"Great location, great views, varying quality...","The location of the tower is second to one, right in the middle of the action, great views, absolutely no complaints there! For families, it is right across the road from a sheltered beach area great for little ones to swim without the waves knocking them over.    One catch to watch out for is that if you book through an independent owner, there is no reception support and you will need to let others know travelling with you of your telephone number as reception will have no record of you, or be able to attend to your needs.    The 2 bedroom/bathroom apartments are well appointed, clean, but the building is old and in need of repair. The rooms are on the small side, and the living space is limited, but the balcony is a great size and we spent lots of time there.    The outdoor pool facilities are small, unshaded and in need of a little TLC.    There are no bars or restaurants if you are feeling lazy and not wanting to venture out into the hussle and bussle of the main strip.    For the price, shop around, as I think you will get better value for money elsewhere.",Aug 2013,June 2013,Traveled with family,"Be aware that each of the independently owned apartments vary in design, quality of furnishings...",Sydney
166984161,50,This place is a Gem!,"This place is fantastic! We stayed at the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower on our recent trip to Oahu June 22 - June 29, 2013. We shared a 2 bedroom, 2 bath unit on the 33rd floor (Room 3303) with another couple and had plently of room. This hotel is centrally located on Waikiki Beach and within walking distance of everything. We had great panoramic views of Waikiki Beach and Diamond Head from the master bedroom and living room lanais (the view you see on the hotel website is exactly what you see from your lania). The unit was clean, nicely furnished, spacious and very comfortable. It had a full kitchen with coffee maker (they even provide coffee daily), microwave oven, full size refrigerator w/ice and water dispenser, washer and dryer, queen bed in master bedroom, 2 twin beds in second bedroom and a couch in living room that made out into a queen size sleeper. There were two full baths - one with walk-in shower, other with a tub/shower combination. There was a nice dining area with table & chairs, nice size living room with plently of comfortable furniture and all rooms had flat screen tvs. There was also free WiFi, and if you had a rental car, free parking in their underground garage, which is a real plus for Waikiki!! There was maid service twice daily and the staff at the front desk as well as the bell desk, were gracious, friendly and very helpful. Special cudos to Tomo, one of the bell hops/captains, for arranging great transportation for us during our stay! Our second day we had a slight problem with the a/c but once reported, it was immediately repaired. I really cannot say enough good things about the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower!! This hotel is all condos, so there's no restaurant on sight, but there are a number of great restaurants, casual eateries and shops within short walking distance of the hotel, plus lots of ABC stores near by!! There's a breakfast place and a McDonald's right next door (McDonald's was temporarily closed due to remodeling during our visit), and there is a small bakery, barbeque place, and ice cream shop adjacent to the hotel. The hotel has a small swimming pool and a jacuzzi/hot tub on the 4th floor, but Waikiki Beach is directly across the street, literally just a few steps away from the hotel entrance, so who needs a swimming pool!. I would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower to friends and family visiting Oahu. If you get an ocean view room on the higher floors (above floor 15), you will have the best views, but I think any of the ocean view units would have a nice view of Waikiki Beach.",Jul 2013,June 2013,Traveled with friends,Rooms on higher floors (15+) have best view.,Sacramento
166575315,40,Return visit and loved it,"We stayed here in late June in a two bed apartment on the 29th floor. We splurged this time for a full ocean view and it as worth it as we spent many late afternoons watching the world go by. The size of these apartments and their balconies is great. The full laundry and kitchen is fantastic, even though we don't cook much on holiday. The location is good,right across from the beach although we tended to walk down towards the Sheratons for better surf, and close to lots of shops and restaurants. Finally the staff are uniformly friendly and helpful so I'm sure we will be back again.",Jul 2013,June 2013,Traveled with family,,"Auckland Central, New Zealand"
166459201,50,"CLEAN, great location, top-notch customer service","We stayed here for 8 nights as a group of 17. We upgraded to ocean front rooms. The rooms were clean, which is my top priority when it comes to choosing a hotel. The fully stocked kitchen and washer dryer were a necessity for my large family. Housekeeping came every day to clean and every night to turn down the beds and leave a treat, and they were very generous with coffee, laundry detergent, soaps, etc. The whole staff was so friendly and helpful, everyone greeting us with an Aloha. The lobby is really small, but they have a nice outdoor seating area in the open walkway. The only downer was that the McDonald’s adjacent to the hotel is under construction, so part of the walkway was boarded off. Otherwise, it would have been a beautiful walkway with the flowers hanging down and view of the beach, great for photo ops.  We basically had the whole floor to ourselves, which was great so we could keep all of our doors ajar and the kids could wander from room to room. We had the -04 room (6 people) which had a great layout and a great view of Diamond Head from the kitchen, master bed and bath, full ocean views from the living room and kitchen and beautiful city view from both bedrooms. The views from every window were spectacular. There is nothing like waking up first thing in the morning and having your breath taken away with a beautiful view of the ocean as you enjoy a cup of coffee on the lanai, then looking out toward Diamond Head as you wash up the dishes from breakfast! My sister and her family (5 people) were in the -03 room which also had a great layout. It was the most open, so this was where we convened most of the time. The back window opened to the breezeway, so I think she kept it shuttered the whole time for privacy purposes, and the bathrooms didn’t have any windows. The second bathroom here was much bigger than the second bathroom in our unit. The view from the lanai was SO beautiful, as it offered full panoramic views of the beach and ocean. My brother’s family and my parents were in the -01 unit (6 people). The layout of this particular room was a little odd, somewhat closed off, but it offered more privacy to those who were sleeping on the pull out couch. It was also the only room who could sleep with all of the windows open without fear of all of their belongings blowing away during the night. It also had a full ocean view with great views of Waikiki.  The location is great…steps from the beach, shopping and restaurants. We walked to and from dinner every night, which was great for the adults enjoying tropical drinks and fun for the kids to get a chance to get a glimpse of tame city nightlife. Going out shopping after dinner was fun too, as most of the shops nearby are open until 11pm or later. There is an ABC store right downstairs, a food pantry within walking distance and Sam’s Club/Walmart was a very short drive away. It had relatively easy access to the freeway, which made driving around the island painless. The location is right across from the beach. Kalakaua Ave. is very pedestrian friendly, so getting from our room to the beach was a piece of cake (even with 9 kids in tow).

The staff was exceptional kind and efficient. We would highly recommend this location.",Jul 2013,June 2013,,,"Marshalltown, Iowa"
166076233,50,Great family value with plenty of room,"We wanted to have an apartment rather than 2 or 3 hotel rooms for our family of 5 with 3 teens. This place was absolutely perfect, in a great location which is fairly quiet but only a few minutes from the centre of everything. Directly opposite the beach they offered us an upgrade on arrival to the top floors for a few extra dollars which was very much worth it, the view was awesome! Just a clue if you can get a room on the left side of the tower (looking out) your view of the beach wont be interrupted by a smaller block in front or alternatively request a room above the 20th floor.  The staff are great & the twice daily service is to a very high standard.

This was perfect with 2 bathrooms, a laundry,and huge living area as well as a large balcony overlooking the ocean.  We couldn't fault the service or the staff. They had an excellent beach towel service and there is a bin containing some beach chairs, umbrellas and mats (first in first served).  We completely agree with the review by UJ99.  We would recommend it to anyone looking for apartment style accommodation. It is serviced daily to a high standard and little treats were left for us to enjoy each night.

165313025,40,Not bad for Waikiki,"Excellent location, relatively reasonable rates for Waikiki. A little strange welcome to the hotel - they took us up to our room, only to find that someone else was already in it. To their credit, the hotel staff was very embarrassed and upgraded us immediately. Our upgraded room was huge with great views of the beach and water on a large balcony. Hotel staff was very friendly. The beach area directly in front of the hotel is ok - typically crowded and a bit dingy looking water. Lots of surfers farther out though. Overall, given that Honolulu is expensive and Waikiki is nowhere near the best beach in HI, I would recommend this hotel for a Honolulu stay.",Jun 2013,May 2013,Traveled as a couple,,"London, United Kingdom"
165206168,50,GREAT HOTEL!! A little tricky to find!,"We stayed here when we visited in March. The location is amazing and we were upgraded to a room with an ocean view! The staff was very accommodating, and the room was very clean. It was a little tricky to find, the entrance was off the street and through a little walk way with gardens, which were gorgeous. Some better signage would help to eliminate confusion. There was some construction in the evenings, which made it difficult to sleep. But overall it was a great hotel and I would stay there again!",Jun 2013,March 2013,Traveled with family,,"Billings, Montana"
165046387,50,Soaring views and customer service.,"Location – Just across the street from the Kuhio beach park and a little further down from the more crowded area of hotels on the beach, this leads to a quieter stay. You are just minutes away by foot from restaurants and gifts shops, and just seconds away from the beach. There is a bus stop across the street, a trolley stop and the free shuttle to Hilo Hattie. We were able to get the bus from the airport to Waikiki, and walk just two blocks to the hotel. The entrance is very low key, and if you weren’t paying attention, you might even miss it. You walk under a trellised archway to the lobby, which is smart if nothing special.    Check-in – Upon check-in, all our paper work was smoothly processed, with the utmost civility. We had a couple of questions, which the receptionist answered fully. She even then showed us to the room, and walked us round all the amenities. They had left us a bottle of champagne and a box of Godiva chocolates for the Hawaii 50/senior citizen special offer – very classy. We had a question about the password for the WiFi, and although it was written on the side of the modem, because it was not on a card on the desk where it should be, within 5 minutes a card with the correct details was brought to the room.    Room – We decided to go for the full ocean view, and it is worth the extra! We were on the 32nd floor, so although you are not directly on the beach, you have a complete and unobstructed view of the ocean, and to the left, a nice view of Diamond Head. We spent a lot of time on the lanai, which had 4 chairs, a table, foot stool and lounger. If you don’t want to eat out every night, then this room has a fully fitted kitchen, with large oven, fridge/freezer and all the cooking equipment you might need. It even has a dishwasher. This unit had two bedrooms, both with TVs, and the master bedroom with sliding doors out on to the lanai. The living room had a very comfortable sofa, and one the most high-tech and largest TVs I’ve ever seen in a hotel room! Nice cable line-up and a lot of HD channels, as well as a DVD player. Coffee maker with tea and coffee restocked daily and even cookies during turn down. Shower was roomy and came with nice high-end selection of toiletries. There is a safe in the closet, big enough for a laptop.    Restaurant – No restaurant in the hotel, but there is in room dining. But there are so many restaurants within a short walk that this is not something you will miss.    Amenities – Has some of the amenities you would expect, but no fitness center or business center. However, if you needed something printed out, I’m sure the staff would be more than happy to do it. I didn’t find that I missed a particular amenity during our stay.    Check-out – Check out was their usual courteous standard, and was accurate and efficient. They asked if we needed a taxi or any help with our luggage. The staff is very focused on detail, which I appreciated.    Pay the extra for the full ocean view, you won’t regret it! The staff is some of the most courteous and helpful that I have ever encountered at a hotel. The March 26th review, I have to totally disagree with – she must have stayed at a different place, or have excessively high standards. Much as I have loved staying at some of the hotels right on the beach in the past, it would be hard to stay somewhere else again next time I am in Waikiki.",Jun 2013,May 2013,Traveled with family,,"Rochester, NY"

The staff was VERY friendly and bent over backwards to answer every question we asked. Convenient to beach, spacious 2 bedroom/2 bathroom suite that was perfect for our family of 5 (king bed in master, twin beds in 2nd bedroom, plus pullout sofa in living room). Large deck & perfect views, full kitchen (we cooked many meals and ate outside on our deck furniture), washer/dryer in master bathroom, and plenty of beach towels available from the valet (we should not have packed any from home!). CLEAN - I'm very picky with hotel cleanliness, and had no concerns at all - everything was spotless when we arrived and cleaned daily.

Kids received a welcome gift which was heaps of fun for time at the beach which was directly across the road. View was amazing, sunset spectacular. Everything I hoped it would be! 2 adults and 2 boys aged 9 and 7 very comfortable in a one bedroom apartment. Kitchen and laundry were very handy for quick meals and for doing all our washing prior to getting on the cruise ship. Perfect!

160938421,50,Ideal stay,Myself and friends recently stayed here in a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom apartment on the 34th floor after arriving in Honolulu after a cruise.  We arrived just before midday and I knew our rooms would be ready so we left our luggage there no problems and was pointed in the direction to get lunch. The staff were very friendly and had lots of suggestions for us. After lunch and walk around Waikiki Beach we arrived back and our apartment was ready. Our luggage was already in the room and staff accompanied us up and then explained all the ammenities for us and showed us how everything worked. They also left us extra washing powder so we could do a few loads of washing.  The apartment was just super. We had a loverly view overlooking the beach and each morning and evening I would sit out there just watching the surfers. Each evening on the beach there was a free concert and we could hear it on the balcony. What a way to end the day with a glass in hand watching the sunset listening to the music. We mostly did shopping and when we came back with all our bags they were very happy to help us get rid of all the rubbish. The apartment was serviced twice a day. It was a short walk to a supermarket (just around the corner) to stock up so we were self supplied with food and the ABC shops just next door had a supply of goods as well.  If staying in Waikiki for a few days I would highly recomend staying here. When I come back I will stay here for sure.,May 2013,April 2013,Traveled with friends,,Adelaide Australia

We were on 12th floor but offered higher at which I declined more for fear of heights. Staff were fantastic nothing was too much. Very family orientated. After two weeks on the mainland of America living in hotels with no facilites was great to have fully self contained apartment with everything needed.  Location was fantastic walked straight across the road to waikiki beach where there was a swallow water inlet great for the kids. Public transport just down the road literally.

159857369,50,Awesome for a family,"We have 4 boys ages 15, 13, 11 and 6. This place was perfect. Our place faced the ocean and all the amenities were new. You take the elevator down and you walk right across the street to the beach. 2 boys slept on the pullout couch and 2 slept in 1 of the 2 bedrooms. It was nice to load up on groceries so we could simply walk back and eat lunch or while some stayed at the beach. The location can't be beat as you are right in the action. We surfed, scuba dived, whale watched, went to Diamond head, went on a sub, and went to Costco and loaded up on supplies. It's an ideal place. They have wave boards you can borrow and other stuff at the condo so ask before you go and buy that . Our place was exactly like the pictures. I would get up early and watch the crazy surfers go out a 5am. There were 100! My wife and I would go for a run while the boys slept and it was a just an awesome vacation for us. The place was great for us and hard to beat. We have stayed at other places but this was the best. You can go cheaper a few blocks in but it's just not as convenient and not nearly as nice.

158934181,50,Awesome!!!,"Rarely have I enjoyed such a perfect stay. To start with, let us say that this condominium resort’s clientele appears to consist mostly of demanding Japanese tourist, which may explain much of what follows… The location, right on the best part of the beautiful Waikiki beach, can’t be beaten. The staff, consisting mostly of incredibly polite and friendly Japanese women, is absolutely first class. But the real shock is when you enter the apartment and realize its size, the high quality of the materials, furniture and equipment, and when you discover the amazing view of the turquoise Pacific Ocean shining through the huge glass doors of the terrace. I estimated the whole apartment (# 2301) to be approximately 200 square meters including a 30 square meters terrace. It had obviously been recently renovated and had two bedrooms and two bathrooms, and the best equipped kitchen one can imagine, with high end oven and microwave oven, dishwasher, rice cooker, coffee maker, a huge fridge including ice maker etc… A huge flat screen TV, DVD player and a Bose sound system in the living room and in each of the bedrooms. A washer and dryer and of course a safe and perfectly working A/C... as well as the curious Japanese WCs with control panel! The room had breathtaking views on 3 sides: the Ocean and Waikiki beach on the front terrace, Diamond Head through the living room and master bedroom side windows, and the mountains from the two bedroom windows at the rear. The room is serviced twice a day, and cleanliness leaves nothing to be desired. No doubt this is one of the most beautiful placed I ever stayed; I wish I could live there! Just a warning, in order to fully enjoy this property you certainly need to be in one of the upper floors (I would say 20th story or higher) or else views may be blocked by adjacent buildings and street noise may be an issue.",Apr 2013,April 2013,Traveled with family,Choose a room on the 20th floor or above,"Luxembourg City, Luxembourg"

This property would definitely benefit from a cafe/restaurant on level 4 and an update of the change rooms/pool area. That would be the only negative though.  We were showed to our room on the 17th floor which was two bedroom ocean front with awesome views of Waikiki and also fully renovated. There was plenty of room for our large family of 4 children and two adults. The beds were super comfortable and being equipped with a kitchen allowed us to prepare some of our own meals.  The location was fantastic directly across the road from Waikiki beach, close to lots of fantastic shops and restaurants.  Not much on offer in terms of entertainment at the hotel but definitely a great base and good value. The kids' gift of buckets/spades was a nice touch.

We stayed in Unit 2601, a premium oceanfront two bedroom/two bathroom apartment, with two children sharing the sofa bed in the lounge. The recently renovated apartment was comfortable for six people, with good sized rooms and cupboards for the children staying on the sofa bed to offload their belongings. The kitchen and lounge overlooked the ocean while the bedrooms were at the back of the apartment and overlooked the mountains. The large lanai provided spectacular views of the beach and Diamond Head. The free Wi-Fi was a hit with the children.    Everything was very clean and housekeeping provided clean linen daily and a turn down service every night.    The service here is amazing; everyone was so friendly and helpful including the front desk staff, the bell staff and housekeeping. Nothing was too much trouble and they provided good advice on rental vehicles and restaurants.    Everything was in walking distance with the beach across the road, an ABC store downstairs and restaurants and shopping just up the road in walking distance.

155671980,30,"If you have high standards for hotels, please read this before booking your reservations","My family and I just returned tonight from a great trip to Hawaii. I wanted to share a few things about our experience with this hotel so that others don't show up for their reservations and are surprised like we were. The website is very very deceiving. The hotel is very run down and needs some re-decorating in a bad way. As we pulled into the parking garage and walk into the lobby, I burst into tears. I couldn't believe the pictures I saw online were the same hotel I was standing in. The lobby was freezing cold, poorly decorated and had an odd smell like a public bathroom. I looked at my husband and said ""You've got to be kidding me! I am not staying here if the rooms look anything like the lobby"". The receptionist took us to the 2 bedroom condo we had reservations for and OMG I lost it. It looked like a retirement home's room, NOTHING like the 2 bedroom room shown on the virtual tour on their website. They then told me that the room had just been renovated. Really!?! WOW! We went back downstairs where the receptionist got her manager and went back upstairs to see another 2 bedroom room. Now this one looked just like the one on the website. I am then told ""well this one is the ocean view room and is actually more money, but we will go ahead and upgrade you to make your stay enjoyable"" I was very very happy about this. However, nowhere on the website does it state that the 2 bedroom room on the virtual tour is only pictures of the ocean view room. (Funny how I just went to look at there website and it now has written under the photos ""deluxe ocean view"" under the images that didn't show that previously. They must have listened when I said they needed to update their info. The partial ocean view room looks NOTHING like the one on the virtual tour. The ocean view is amazing and worth the extra money. If you plan to visit this hotel or any hotel on the same street or by this hotel, I strongly encourage you to find a hotel on another street. There is construction going on right in front of this hotel that starts at 6:30 am every day but Sunday. It is very loud and wakes you up.    I will list the pros and cons of this hotel to help you make your own decisions on how you feel about this hotel. I have very high standards for hotels and the only thing that this hotel had that was wonderful was the staff and service.    CONS~  No restaurant in hotel  No gift shop or snack shop to grab something to eat  No Room Service  Pool area has no shade and is very small  Pool area closes at 9pm    PROS~  Directly across the street from the beach  Walking distance to many shops, several ABC stores and restaurants  Spacious and very clean rooms  Comfortable beds  Great customer service and staff",Mar 2013,March 2013,Traveled with family,ocean views are worth the extra money,"Temecula, California"

We were in a 2B/2B premium oceanfront with spectacular views of Diamond Head and the ocean. Although this rooms (#3501) furniture was a bit dated and no flat panel TV's, everything worked fine. Plenty of room for 6 to spread out and relax. Bunches of closets, large lanai with ample seating was nice to relax on. Bedrooms were good size and had mountain views. WI-FI worked great and the unit had plenty of outlets to stay charged and connected.(Very important with a 14 & 21 year old)    Bathrooms were clean, washer/dryer with detergent made things handy when spilling chocolate ice cream all over myself!    Housekeeping came around twice a day and kept everything neat and clean. Front desk was always friendly and helpful. Bell staff especially Ed and Eddy were terrific and always offered great advice on places to see and eat. Nice to have valet parking as the streets are packed and parking is a premium. We rented a mini-van and it came in very handy traveling the island. Traffic is bad all the time.    Diamond head was a nice walk for me in the mornings as it is only 2 miles away.Beach access is out the front door and across the street. Convenient walking to everything. McDonald's right down stairs closed a few days after we arrived for a 5 month renovation, so Big Mac meal fans will have to go elsewhere to pick up your $9 meal.

Especially liked the big patio (lanai?) that allows for 6 people to comfortably sit outside (with a great view of the beach/strip, esp. for a ""partial"" ocean view).    The only downside: The condo we stayed in needs an update. The pictures on this site show granite countertops and stainless appliances etc....in reality the suite appears circa 1998 (tile countertops, tube TVs, etc). I admit to feeling ""falsely advertised"" to upon check-in...    But in general, we enjoyed our stay. Other plusses:  - Staff was excellent and the free valet parking was great for us, as our group of 6 had a minivan that we used fairly frequently.  - McDonalds and Eggs and Things are right out front for great breakfast options  - Kids get a free pail, shovel and toy  - Valets have a selection of beach paraphernalia to use for free    We'd definitely stay there again....I'd just see about getting a condo that's seen a paintbrush sometime during the Obama administration! ;-)",Feb 2013,January 2013,Traveled with family,"Ask for photos of the exact suite.

The reception staff were wonderful especially Yutz (spelling may be wrong) and Jon the very helpful on call does everything for you. We called him to work out our tvs and the oven on a few occasions. The position was fantastic walking distance to everything with next to no noise. After reading tripadvisor got a few tips. As we were there 10 days from Australia I caught a cab to local saveway store and bought food for the week. I got a free Safeway card which on my $430 bill saved me $60. It's worth the $9.50 fare. The rooms were very roomy and everything you need in a holiday unit.

148007250,50,Way Too Short a Stay. Want to go back,"We stayed two nights at the Aston Beach Tower before our cruise on the Pride of America. We arrived at the hotel around 9 pm after our long flight from the east coast. The hotel is a bit hard to find as the entrance is on the side street. I knew it was near the McDonalds. Once we arrived we were greeted by the super friendly staff.    We had a one bedroom (2103 if I remember correctly). The room was in great shape except for the air conditioner (more on that in a bit). The layout is very nice and the furniture was in great shape, The balcony was a great size and the furniture was very comfortable. I did not realize though till the next morning that the ice maker had to be turned on so we didn't have ice till that night. The room comes with coffee which was nice. I didn't realize and had brought our own.    The hotel is up past the major craziness of Waikiki which was nice and beach was a short walk across the street and we walked to the Outrigger Waikiki in less than 10 minutes. The valet was quick and gave us a map which we kept for our entire trip to help us get to the H1 and told us to visit the Pali lookout when we ventured to the North Shore the day after we arrived. I am so glad they told us. The view was tremendous.    After returning we explored and found the pool. It looked great but we choose to go into the ocean instead. If we had more time than we would have used the pool.    The only issue we had was the air conditioner in the room. The first night it did not shut off. I got up during the night and found a long sleeve shirt and put it on. We told the front desk on our way out. We returned that evening and found that the heat was on and the room was up near 90. We told them and then went out. We came back quite a while later and they were still working on the unit. We were told that they didn't have the part to fix it that night but they could rig it to run all night again. We had them rig it. We could deal with the cold better than the heat. I put pillows from the couch and chairs on top of the tv cabinet in the bedroom to keep it from blowing directly on us. It worked.    We addressed this issue the next morning when we checked out and the lady at the front desk told me that she would address it with her manager when he returned about issuing a credit. Well the credit card bill came and no credit. I called the hotel and was credited one night of our stay for our inconvenience. I ordinarily don't do things like that but the problem was not fixed the first time and we were kept out of our room for nearly three hours while it was being fixed at night. It was almost 11 when we got back into our room and our bodies thought it was 4 am. We had to get up early to go to Pearl Harbor the next morning so we could not sleep in.

145345346,20,Overrated,"I stayed at a condo in Maui last year for a week and it was wonderful, so I expected the similar experience at Aston Beach Tower. After spent a week here, I found that the Aston has almost nothing comparable, not even close. If Aston is a 4-star hotel/condo, the Maui one would be a 7-star (and it was cheaper than Aston)!    This is basically an apartment building - there is a tiny tiny lobby, bedroom-size reception, no bar, no restaurant, a 500 sqft swimming pool that nobody uses, a pool table covered by dust. The room was good, kitchen was well equipped (but again, not comparable with the Maui one). The view would be great if you live above 17 floor (that passes the Aston circle in front of it) and your view isn't partially blocked by your neighbour.    The location is the only thing I feel good about it - it is a street away from waikiki beach (which is always super crowded).

Part way through our stay we were upgraded to a Penthouse, which was essentially the same as the room we had, but on a slightly higher floor.  The location of this property is fantastic. We were right across the road from the beach - took us about 3 minutes from our apartment to the sand. Friends were staying at the very luxurious (and pricey) Sheraton up the road. The Sheraton is actually on the beach but because that property is so enormous it took them considerably longer to make it from their room to the sand (proving that more expensive is not necessarily better at least as far as location is concerned!)  The Beach Tower is also well situated as far as shopping and restaurants go. Everything you need is right outside your door.  The first room we had was lovely - very spacious and clean, the beds were comfy and it had everything we needed. the furniture wasn't exactly modern, but it was all in good repair and comfortable so this was no problem. The view was absolutely spectacular.  The service was excellent. Housekeeping staff were friendly and efficient and even came in the evening to offer turndown if desired. My husband hired a couple of surfboards for the week, which staff happily stored for him. Each morning the porters/valets would retrieve his board so all he had to do was carry it across the road and he was set for the day.  There was one slight hiccup during our stay but we were very happy with the way the hotel handled this situation. The apartment above ours was being renovated during our stay. One morning we were woken by loud banging noises. My husband complained to management and the problem as swiftly taken care of. Workers were told to stop (as it was 8-30 in the morning and they were not supposed to make noise until after 10) and then we were offered an upgrade to a different room.

There is a pass-through window between the kitchen and the lanai for convenient dining outside.  On the ninth floor, we have a great view straight out at the ocean and beach.

Another great aspect is you walk out of complex and straight across the road is the beach. Great location for shops, ABC stores for general merchandise are everywhere. Cheesecake Factory excellent for meals but queues are huge-go about 5.30pm put your name down and table takes 1.5hrs usually so ready for dinner around 7 pm .you get a buzzer and if you go across the road and sit upstairs at bar the buzzer can be detected fom there so no need to sit and wait outside the restaurant for that length of time. Surfing lessons and outrigger all reasonably priced for beach family activities. Fireworks on Fri night at Dukes beach at 19.45 kids will love them. Only snag we hit was we had early flight so out by 5.30 am and front desk hadn't passed on to bell desk to collect our luggage and order taxis so just double check with guys at front of house that this has been organised.

We moved to another condo on the other side, but rug worn and dirty, dishwasher worked but dishes always dirty so we washed by hand.

142048426,40,Great Location - Beautiful Staff!,"We have just returned from a 10 day vacation at the Beach Tower. We were part of a large group (2 adults and 3 kids in one room and 3 adults in another room) and we all agreed that this location was superb. The staff were just amazing from the moment we arrived at the front desk to the time when we sadly had to leave. Nothing was ever a problem for them (including helping us clean at 12.30am from a vomiting child!) The room was very spacious, clean and comfortable with such an amazing view (we were located on the 17th floor). Everything in the room worked perfectly and was in good condition. The only concern we had was the loudness of the airconditioning unit but we just turned it off and opened a window. This was sufficient! The location is perfect with the beach, restaurants, shopping and tourist landmarks at your front door or within very short walking distance. We didn't get a chance to use the pool as the weather was perfect and the beach just too inviting to go past! I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for that little bit of extra space on your vacation. It was lovely having 2 bedrooms and a dining area to keep all of our shopping!

The location was perfect, close to everything and a short 10 second walk across the street until you hit the soft sand and waves. Restaurants are close by as is any shop you'd like. Waikiki Beach is one of the most expensive and most touristy spots in all of Hawaii, but if even just for visiting Pearl Harbor and spending the day on the beach, it's worth it.  The housekeeping was fantastic and very accommodating. The front desk staff and valets would go out of their way with any requests. I'd forgotten the mouse for my laptop and they lent me one. My daughters ""camera"" ran out of AA batteries and they brought one right up. Extra pillows, more coffee, sugars, silverware..... no problem.  The extra room in the suite was wonderful and the balconies are a great plus to listen to the sounds of the waves and watch the sunset.  The cost, for this kind of space and location, is extremely affordable.    Now, for the down side and I almost don't want to mention it as I know the amazing management will want to read and respond but, it's a fact - this hotel is one of the older hotels. I'm not sure if all hotels in Waikiki are not modern, but you should not arrive here expecting the Four Seasons. It's along the same line as a mid-level Hilton. I'd say 3-3.5 stars, certainly not any less than that. The Wi-Fi, although it gave consistent signal, was spotty at times. Nothing concerning though as you shouldn't be sitting around in Hawaii on your computer or phone :) The HVAC system was incredibly loud until we called the front desk and, as always, they arrived promptly and sorted out the problem (a blocked pipe or something) and it quieted down.

To make this hotel more ""modern"" would take a massive overhauling which would be both expensive and time consuming - which would make the hotel unavailable for months on end AND make room rates higher, both of which are unacceptable for a location and price like this.

We have two rooms and it was big, nice, clean rooms and beautiful ocian view. My three children love the comfy bed and toys for them to take out to the beach. This place is Waikiki's most luxurious condominium resorts, Aston Waikiki Beach Tower provides the perfect combination of condominium living and exclusive hotel-quality service. Conveniently located near the center of Waikiki's main stretch, the hotel offers easy access to an eclectic mix of shopping, dining, activities and exciting nightlife. And also just steps away from a wide variety of ocean activities from surfing to snorkeling and parasailing to sunset cruises.  Aston Waikiki Beach Tower offers spacious and elegantly furnished one- and two-bedroom suites. With a fully equipped gourmet kitchen in each suite, you'll have the option of making your own meals, or preparing quick snacks between beach visits. The daily housekeeping and nightly turndown service was very nice and friendly and you got your own washer/dryer for extra convenience to dry your children closes.  The Views from all suites that we stayed at Aston Waikiki Beach Tower are breathtaking. From your private lanai, you'll be able to watch the sailboats and surfers skimming the waves, or catch a spectacular Waikiki sunset.  From recreation deck, you can enjoy heated swimming pool, jet spa and sauna, or just relax in a chaise lounge.

139497535,50,"Our new ""home"" in Hawaii","We stayed at the Beach Tower in 2010 and were very happy with our stay. Now, 2 years later, our visit was even better than the first.    Even though the suites are huge and very nice, and the location is next to perfect, I think that the staff is probably our favorite part of staying at this location. Starting from the check-in, everyone we dealt with was top-notch and seemed to really enjoy their jobs. After check-in we received a follow-up call from Mary at the front desk to ensure everything was OK with our room. In addition, we received a call from Mike, the GM, to again make sure our room met our expectations. The follow-ups didn't disturb us at all and show excellent customer service. If you notice the previous reviews for this hotel, you'll see that Mike does comment on many of them. Obviously, he cares about this hotel and his customers.    In addition to the GM and front desk staff, we also had good interaction with the housekeeping staff. They have twice daily cleaning, (evenings are more of a turn down/touchup) and they timed the cleaning with our schedule. I ran into a housekeeper in the entry way and she asked what time would be convenient to do the cleaning. Again, great customer service. In addition, my previous review praised the valet staff, and they were just as good this time. They are there to get the car, but also provide beach mats, towels, and will offer an opinion when asked about an activity. Great group of guys and the 3 we dealt with most, Ed, Eddy, and Russ were all there 2 years ago if I remember correctly. They even offered to park the car ""close"" to save us time if we would be leaving again soon. Of course, you will want to tip the valet staff, but the valet parking is included in the price of the room.    The location is fabulous, right across the street from Waikiki Beach. The area directly in front of the hotel has a rock wall that makes the water gentle, but to each side of the wall there are the expected waves for surfing, bodyboarding or playing in the water. This gives you the option of gentler water (great for younger kids), or full waves that our older children enjoy. There is also a small stage area on the beach in front of the hotel where we've seen Hawaiian music played and dancers some afternoon/evenings. Overall, I can't picture a better location on the beach.    For our family of older teenagers, the additional space in the suites works well for us. We had the master suite with it's own bathroom, and the kids shared the other bedroom, again with another bathroom. There's a full living room/seating area, a full kitchen with dining area, and a huge lanai. We were on a higher floor and from the front of the unit we could see all the way from Diamond Head to I believe Barber's Point the other direction. From the back of the unit we had a great view of the mountains. Note that each floor only has four units and they go from the front to the back of the building. This means that you will not only have an ocean view, but in many of the suites (on higher floors) also a mountain view over the top of the other hotels, all from the same unit. Since our last visit they have also installed wireless internet in the rooms in addition to the wired.    As Eddy loaded the car for us to return to the airport, he stated ""see you again next year"". We talked a little further and realized based on the conversation that he remembered us from our stay 2 years ago. Based on the hundreds of families that stay there every year, this amazed us. I don't know what our travel plans are for next year, but if they include Oahu, you can count on it that you'll ""be seeing us again"".",Sep 2012,August 2012,Traveled with family,"Our full ocean view this time was of course great, but even the ""partial"" ocean view...","Prior Lake, MN"

From our apartment, 3304, we had a full view of Waikiki Beach,and we enjoyed gorgeous sunsets every evening. Surfing lessons were just steps away from us on the beach. For the kids - McDonalds right next door. ABC stores 2 minutes' walk from hotel. You get the picture.    What I have to specially mention though, which really made the stay special, has been the excellent service we received, from Yasu at concierge, Regan and Mary at Front Desk, the housekeeping staff. Whenever we had to call front desk about any matter, they would look into it right away and even call us to check if everything was okay, and if we had been tended to.

What a great view we had of the ocean, mountains, and the east side of the island. Yes, every room had a window with a beautiful view. It even had a window with a view in the master bathroom. The hotel provided everything we needed and more. It was equipped with various sizes of pots, pans, soaps, dish cloths, silverware, dishes, packaged coffee, coffee maker, blender, rice maker, even chopsticks. The living room had all of the comforts of home with big flat screen TVs in each room, wifi connections, ipod speaker, double sinks in the master bedroom, etc. The furniture and room decor was elegant with cherry wood and a very comfortable sofa bed and chair. The view once again was fantastic. You could see the entire Waikiki beach and all of the granduer that Hawaii has to offer.    The bellman/valet man named ""Eddy"" was so nice and was able to provide information about where to get some great local food such as ""shave ice"", ""long johns"", ""poke"", ""chop suey"".

If your'e looking for a great place to stay on your next trip to Hawaii, I strongly recommend the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower. It has everything you need.

We orignally booked a partial ocean view room but then upgraded to the deluxe oceanfront room upon arrival. We were shown both the penthouse and the deluxe oceanfront rooms (the premium oceanfront rooms were completely booked so we didn't get to see any of them). The penthouse and deluxe OF rooms were exactly the same. However, the penthouse had totally unobstructive views and was high up. You could see the Hilton Hawaiian Village Friday night fireworks from the balcony. The penthouse rooms also comes with slippers and bathrobes for your use (the deluxe oceanfront did not). In the deluxe oceanfront rooms, you can see some of the other surrounding hotels on the sides. The premium oceanfront rooms are higher up and above the the surrounding hotels which is probably the best option if you want beachfront, unobstructed views without having to pay penthouse prices. The TVs were old (non-flatscreen) but had a ton of channels and the rooms could definitely use some spucing up with new coats of paint (there were a lot of visible scuff marks which made the room seem more outdated). However, the tile floors in the bathroom and kitchen were clean (I know because we had to wipe up the wet floor with a towel in these areas and the towel came up clean) and the service impressive. Every time we needed to use our car, the valets were quick. We never waited more than 5 minutes. The valets were friendly and greeted us by name. The in-room washer and dryer was convenient. They provided laundry detergent too. The location was perfect! Just a walk through a beautiful archway of flowers, and the beach was right across the street.

Housekeeping came immediately and cleaned....but it was still noticeable the next day. We were a little surprised, based on the level of service we'd seen in the past, that they didn't offer to put us in another room as it wasn't a matter of not liking the set up of the room, it actually smelled. I know the hotel was pretty full but we still found it odd.    We were planning on upgrading when we could, so we moved rooms anyway. We also received two bottles of champagne during our stay free of charge. The room we upgraded to was on the 30th floors and had spectacular views. We stay there for the space, views, proximity to everything and, above else, the people who work there. The valets are personable, prompt, helpful and very nice. If you're there long enough, they get to know your habits (i.e. if you leave early in the morning) and will park your car accordingly. As we were often driving to other parts of the island, they usually had our car close. The parking is free which is another reason we stay here and they also provide you with towels and chairs free.    Other people have mentioned the furnishings but this was not important to us.

133287094,50,Awesome Experience!!!,"We stayed here for our 20th wedding anniversary and loved it. If you are considering a stay at one of the other large resort hotels on Waikiki you should check out the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower first. This is a condo-style hotel with 2 BR/2 BA units, full kitchen and in-room laundry. It is a perfect location only a few steps from the beach. One of the great advantages of the Aston is that it does not have a huge lobby with restaurants and bars so you don't get the swarms of people around the hotel as you would at other locations. The comments in other reviews regarding the friendly hotel staff are absolutely true. Everyone we encountered during our stay was so nice it was incredible. The rooms at the hotel are all privately owned units that are managed by the hotel. There is a variation in the decor and remodel dates of the rooms based on when the owner did the upgrades. You can ask the staff at the registration desk when the room was last remodeled and request a more recently updated room if it is available. The rooms a very spacious and it was nice to have a separate bedroom and bathroom for our daughter. There are lots restaurant and bar choices close by and you will really appreciate that they are outside the hotel when you see how busy Waikiki can be.

131385192,50,Location location!,"My wife along with her parents and our 10 month old boy have just returned from a 9 night stay at this Hotel. We stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment on the 30th floor (room 3003) and we're very happy with all aspects of our stay. The location is brilliant with only a 50m walk across the road to the beach and close to all the action in Waikiki. The view was simply amazing and was worth every cent we paid for a premium room. Make sure when you book you request a room in the centre of the building as the 2 end rooms only have 90 degree views of the ocean from your front balcony. Rooms ending with 02 or 03 have a full 180 degree view of the ocean that you will never get sick of looking at.    As a bonus our room was serviced daily and every afternoon we received treats (chocolates, biscuits etc) from the hotel staff. All staff were friendly and went out of their way to attend all of our needs. The 2 Eddys that worked as concierges (bell boys) really stood out and were always happy for a chat or to point us in the right direction.    If you are eating out The Cheesecake Factory and Dukes are good value for money if you are just after some casual dining. If you are looking for some takeaway you can't go past Me BBQ which a Korean joint 1 block away. If you have an apartment like we did and want to cook a couple of meals yourself make sure you fork out the $12 for a Cab to the local Safeway. They are open 24 hours and have all your grocery needs as well as alcohol and prescription drugs. Make sure you get a Safeway card. They are a free loyalty card that saved us $40 on our $280 purchase. Make sure you also buy your alcohol from here as it is very expensive from you local Waikiki ABC store. For example a carton of Corona 24pk is $28.99 with your Safeway card.    The only fault we could mention about our stay was that there was no range hood in our kitchen. This made cooking a little difficult as smoke would fill the room quiet quickly. A few other people on this site have also mentioned about the rooms being a little out dated. Whilst I will agree they are not 5 star in terms of furnishings etc they are very clean and well maintained. Hey but if you are going to Waikiki for a holiday to sit in your room all day you may as well just stay at home. We spent all our time either on the balcony, at the beach or shopping.",Jun 2012,June 2012,Traveled with family,,"Gatton, Australia"

130411659,50,Highrise Luxury,"We stayed here during my daughter's wedding week last September. It 's a beautiful property.  This is a highrise building that sits off Kalakaua Ave. When we checked in we decided to upgrade to a 2 bedroom oceanview (they are all Oceanview) on the 26th floor. It was over 1200 sq ft, killer views, everything brand new, granite kitchen, huge lanai, huge master with en suite, nice views up the mauka from the master. Being a wedding and all, there were 6 to 8 people sleeping there at all times, and there was room for everyone. The most notable thing for my stay there, was the gracious way the staff handled our impromtu Rehersal Dinner Party. We planned to go to Duke's at about $2000 total cost, once I saw how large the condo was, I decided to go to Costco, and throw the party there! What a total success. The staff patiently and graciously escorted all 30+ of our guests as they came in up to the 26th floor. The security also handled the teenage boy portion of our party very ""diplomatically"" too I might add.    I would recommed this property very highly.

129481060,40,Great Experience,"My family and I stayed here last Aug (2011). We were trying to go to hawaii as economically as possibe. Most hotels on the beach were pretty expensive, but through Travel Hawaii we were able to book the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower, 2 BR Oceanview for about 400 per night. I thought that was incredible compared to other pricing for high end places (most about 600-800 whenright on the beach) Plus this place had modern looking furniture, tvs in every room, a modern kitchen/dining room to eat in to save money.......It was wonderful. We opened the sliding glass doors of the living room and dining room and just walked in and out all day to sit on the balcony or whatever. Also great was the fact that every day the staff would slip a note under our door with an idea of an activity we might want to do on the island that day. The Aston is right across the street from Waikiki Beach, there are lots of places to shop and eat all up and down the street, there is public transportation easily accessible, and if you have a car...free valet. The staff always welcomes you ""home"" each time you arrive. They have free towels, matts, etc for the beach....I could go on and on. My family and I thoroughly enjoyed our Hawaiian vacation and highly recommend the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower to anyone interested in persuing a non hotel experience, more of a home away from home experience while saving a little money.

129264506,30,Not as Good as I thought it would be!,"My new husband and I (along with some family members) have just recently come back from Honolulu where we got married and we stayed at the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower. Before booking I had read the reviews on Trip Advisor I must say that I was a bit disappointed. Although we booked a 1 bedroom Ocean View Room we were upgraded to a 2 bedroom Ocean View Room on the 30th Floor. This sounded really great and it was up until they started jack hammering next door as they were renovating the condo next to us. This was only for a day but they should have told us prior and unfortunately this happened the day after our wedding day!!!    The building itself was fine but is in need of some updating and for the price I would have expected more. The other thing that was annoying although out of the hotels control was the renovation of the beach which meant that there were trucks and heavy machinery up and down the beach from 7am until lunch time. The hotel didn't discount their prices at all and in fact didn't acknowledge that the beach renovation was happening!!!!    On the positive side you couldn't help but get blown away by the views, soooo beautiful and on the 30th floor it was breathtaking!!!! If this building were to be renovated to a higher standard they would be in 5 star class. The position of this condo it great, in the middle of town and the free parking and internet are a big plus. The size of the condo was also a big plus as there is plenty of room to spread out.    The service we received was on the whole was pretty good but there were a couple of instances with staff which were unnecessary and uncalled for but most of the people there were great. I think this property in its day was probably the best of its time but they need to step it up if they want to be classed as 5 star.",May 2012,April 2012,Traveled with family,Make sure you are on the higher floors as there is a building in front of the Waikiki Beach Tower...,"Gold Coast, Australia"

Kitchen was well stocked with the necessary implements for cooking and entertaining etc.    The beds were fantatsic with six excellent pillows on the King main.    This is not a Hotel as such but more a block of managed apartments hence there is no restaurant however being Waikiki beach there are various restuaurants etc all within easy walking distance.    Car parking (valet) is availaable and free as is a good Wifi connection which is also free for the duration of your stay.    The only minor complaint we would have is with the pool which is difficult to find and really not up to the standard you would find in 5 star accomodation.

128653629,40,What it is and what it isn't,"We stayed at the Aston Waikiki Tower for 6 days in April. It really was a great experience overall. I wanted to share some more details about this property. Hopefully this is helpful.    What it definitely is:  Great for families to stay together in an apartment like setting  Stayed at 2 BR/2BA place and it was great for everyone to have their own space  Kitchen is excellently stocked. Had everything we needed  View was awesome! Balcony facing Waikiki beach directly. Really gorgeous to wake up to this.  Balcony facing beach was spacious  Property was very clean  Having laundry on hand was really helpful to wash sandy beachwear  Location is truly fantastic - grocery stores and restaurants are literally within minutes  People at the front desk, valet and staff were genuinely friendly - Shout out to Tomo! He was awesome  Free valet parking (I think the only place with free valet) in downtown Honululu - awesome  Service was top notch - anytime we needed anything someone was upstairs in a jiffy to help  Like I said, it was a great place for the entire family to hang and be with each other - building great memories!  For the price, for the amenities, for the location, for the number of people it accomdates, this property is really great!    What is it not:  Not a high end property - more middle of the road  If you are looking for a resort feel or high end hotel feel, you will be disappointed  Somehow after reading other reviews (which is why I booked this), I was expecting a 4 or 5 star type of property. Did not feel that way though  Felt a little bit dingy with frayed carpets and old furniture  The entrance and lobby really left a lot to be desired. They really looked quite ordinary. Not anything like what you would expect to see in a vacation hotel.    We stayed on Maui at the Four Seasons Resort at Wailea for a few days in the middle of our trip and contrast was very sharp. Super high end and quite middle of the road. But, for the reasons we chose it (cooking, family time etc), it worked out great for us.

We were upgraded to a full oceanview two bedroom/bathroom apartment which was certainly big enough for a family of four.

The kitchen was well equipped and the beds comfortable, the location was fantastic, close to beach shops etc; and the staff were very friendly and helpful. The pool area wasn't very inviting and lacked atmosphere but overall we had a great time.

It's great place to stay. The rooms are clean. The beds are comfortable and the staff very friendly. We're always greeted by the staff when we left and returned. No restaurant on site but lots of good restaurants within walking distance. It's right across the road from Kuhio beach. If you have young kids or inexperience swimmers Kuhio beach is great because there are breakers which encloses the area so it's look a protected beach.    The hotel also had a outdoor pool on 5? floor, so it can get windy. The only complaint that I had was for 2 of the 3 stays our room was ready on arrive day. But they did compensate when we raise our concerns. The first time we got an upgrade to a room with full-view. And the secodn time, they offer us a complimentary bottle of wine.    Love the place.

You dont have to lug all the beach gear blocks to the beach , & blocks back. If you have your own or rent a surf board they have storage for those as well.    Trolley stop across the road, to all the place you need to go: Ala Moana shopping Mall/Ward Centre/Hilo Haties    One block back is Kuhio Ave, which is where the main bus lines run . There is a stop at the back end of the hotel which leaves you a 2 min walk home.    Our Apartment looked straight out over the palm trees to a beautiful view of the ocean.We found the 2 bedroom/2 bathroom apartments to be fantastic for our family of 5. Much better than having to have 2 hotel rooms. The fully equipped kitchen is great for preparing a few meals to keep your food costs down. There are a few supermarkets within minutes walk to buy your ingredients. There is an ABC shop right outside the front entrance, which is enough get some of the basics with. Our kitchen was very modern with 2 door fridge with water dispenser/ice maker built in, Electric oven & glass cook top. The TVs were all new flat screens, 1 in each bedroom plus a huge on in the lounge room, (Sony Bravias) Not that we watched them a lot but are handy at night & if the weather stops you from getting outside.    As mentioned by other reviewers The furniture/decor is a quite dated, but, as a place for a holiday for a week its fine. If you were buying the apartment you would definitely be dong a maker on it, thats for sure. The hotels photos were clearly taken a few years ago, but then they al do the same thing.

The staff is great, free valet parking and wireless (very fast) internet. Rooms are very spacious. The view from the higher floors is marvelous.  However, there are several problems with this hotel. It is completely outdated. It looks like lots of years old. The price is more or less the same price for other hotels (if you don’t mind to be in a hotel instead of a condominium) right on the beach not across the street, like this one.  I love high-rise buildings and the views from it. We stayed at a 30's floor. But I can't imagine staying in this hotel with small children playing around. I will definitely need a special door lock for the terrace and then you will probably lose the best of the rooms, the terrace with the doors wide opened.  Finally, the photos that you will see of this hotel/condominium in several web sites aren't close to the reality. This place looks old. The photo of the room that you can see everywhere with a hall and some kind of dining room or lanai, well, that wasn't mine. It's offered as the ""2 Bedroom Oceanfront Suite"", I paid more for a ""2 Bedroom Premium Oceanfront Suite"", which was supposed to be the same room but at an upper level, and it was far a way of looking like that.",Apr 2012,April 2012,Traveled with family,,Mexico City
127970228,40,The Aston's biggest asset is their staff,"During early April 2012, my young family and I stayed in a two bedroom oceanview apartment on the 33rd floor.    Pros – Central Location, close to everything and directly across the road from the Waikiki enclosed beach area. Spacious rooms, kept very clean by housekeeping. Beds are very comfortable with cable TV in every room. Outstanding service from all Aston staff members – professional, courteous and helpful. Great views from Ocean View apartments. Fast internet access from all areas.    Cons – Rooms are very clean but extremely dated think 1980’s with 1990’s mod cons. Swimming pool is small and also dated. We didn’t go in the pool during our entire stay despite my children’s love of resort style swimming pools. If anything the top level apartments are too high with constant wind noise coming from Diamond Head and whistling through the windows even when they were closed. I’m not scared of heights but from the 33rd floor the view was incredible but a little uncomfortable. It’s a long way down.

The service from everyone was very good. The car was brought to us so fast every time we needed it, was nice not to have to find parking. The cord was broken in the room for the internet and within 5 minutes we had a service tech there fixing it. I had 4 little complaints. The toilets are strange. Everytime you sit, water starts pouring into the bowl and scared my kids haha! There is an option to wash and dry. When you select the dry option, it smells like cow manure seriously! For my Mom who was on the couch in the living room, the hall light was on all the time which I understand. The issue was that there are glass sides to the door which allowed the light to shine in which bothered her and would bother me as well. At most hotels, there are boogie boards, snorkel gear etc. to borrow for the day. There was none of that so we had to purchase 4 boogie boards to use for the 3 days that we had there which was very expensive. We left them to a family we met at the pool so they wouldn't have to spend the money(they had 2 kids the same as us and were very grateful). The 3rd thing that I was dissapointed about was how cold the pool was. It is shaded the entire day so it doesn't warm up from the sun for sure. It was deserted most of the time. There is a great hot tub by the pool but when you pay for a pool in the price, you hope that it isn't freezing, this one was. We stayed at the Aston in Maui and the landscaping was beautiful, great pool and hot tub. Other than these small things, we had a great stay, can't say enough about the service and the room. Go to Duke's for supper, fun and great salad bar. Great shopping, never seen so many stores in my life! If I were to come back, I would stay here again, great beach as well.

I was expecting a more luxurious apartment (the apartment was dated), but it was still extremely comfortable. Plenty of room in the lounge room even with the sofa bed folded out (we left it out for the entire duration of our stay without a problem). The sofa bed was very comfortable for an adult to sleep on. Air con worked very well and it was easy to get all areas of the apartment to a comfortable temperature. There are plenty of restaurants nearby (including child friendly ones). Hilton Hotel which is a very short walk away (very doable even with small children) has a good breakfast that is open 24 hours. Sandwich shop around the corner as well. This hotel is right on a great beach for kids (you literally step out the front door and you are there). On arrival the kids are given a gift of some sand toys.

123382366,30,Great location,"There are good and not so good comments from our stay here. Whether or not this hotel is for you really depends on what you want. The best part of this hotel is its location - right opposite Waikiki Beach. Also the fact it is self-contained is a huge plus: having your own kitchen and laundry is a real bonus. Beware though, that the oceanfront apartments look directly into the back of the neighbouring property if you are on a level lower than level 12. You will see right into your neighbours apartment, and they will see into yours. We still had great views of the beach from our balcony, but the next door hotel was a little distracting. The hotel itself is looking a little tired and drab in places, we found the furniture somewhat shabby and the bed uncomfortable. Noisy small wall-mounted airconditioner made for restless sleeping. If you wander through some of the larger well known hotels/resorts, then this one is certainly in need of some upgrades by comparison. However, if looks dont bother you, then this hotel will be great. The valets and concierge staff were very friendly and helpful, however there was only one person in the front office who bothered to make any effort and provide anything remotely resembling service. Note here: i have already taken this up with management, who have responded to my experiences and are looking into the matters we brought up.

The central location made the Beach Tower an ideal place to stay in Waikiki with the beach right across the road and as the shops here are open till 11pm, there was plenty of time to shop after sightseeing.

On our first visit, we got an upgrade to a presidential suite at no extra cost. The view from the top floors are astounding, so we were disappointed with the view from our 12th floor balcony this time. For those wanting a good view, I would suggest asking for a room above the 15th floor (about the top of the Circle Hotel, which is in front of the Beach Tower).    As others have said, the service is outstanding. The valet was very speedy, and they always remembered where we had gone for the day and asked how our trip was. Also, the room service was always very fast in bringing whatever we requested, from laundry soap to a new iron.    I wouldn't say that the suite was in the best shape; it could use a good paint to clean up the scuff marks and dings in the walls, and a good spring clean for items that wouldn't normally get cleaned every day (like the cupboards or water sprinkler heads). The beds were very comfy, but for the first few nights we slept on the hide-a-bed. Hide-a-beds are rarely as nice as real beds, and this was no exception.    We enjoyed our stay at the Beach Tower.

As a family of 6, our choices in Waikiki were limited if we wanted an apartment close to the beach, so we are SO thankful that the Beach Tower exists!  I do not need to elaborate much, as most of the prior reviews are accurate - the views (from the higher floors at least) are the most amazing I have ever experienced in many trips to Waikiki, and the location ideal. Being just across from the beach it was so easy to come and go as we pleased, our teens could head up to the room while we stayed on the beach with the younger ones, and you could even watch your older kids surfing from our balcony!  On our first stay our apartment was very well equipped (our second stay not as good, less kitchen equipment, pans not big enough for a large family etc) but on both occasions the beds were very comfortable, the apartments were quiet and we were exceptionally happy with our stay.  A suggested improvement - There is a large frosted glass partition next to the front door of every apartment - overnight it lets a LOT of light in from the outside hall lights which made sleeping for those on the sofa-bed difficult - resulting in us having to stack a tower 7 foot high of sofa cushions next to the glass to block the light out!)

We called for extra towels and a housekeeper showed up prepared to to whatever cleaning would be needed. This was over and above what I would expect.  The location was perfect also.

One particular incident we were unimpressed with was our phoning down to concierge to ask them to call a taxi for us, only to be told that where we wanted to go was only a ten minute walk away and that we would be better off walking than waiting for a taxi. We realised the short way but had spent the whole day touring and were extremely tired.

120352483,40,Aloha 2011,"We chose the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower solely because of the reviewer ratings and consistently positive comments on Trip Advisor. We have never stayed at an Aston property before; nor had we ever rented a condo. We were there for 11 nights and we would agree with most of what others have written. To elaborate somewhat on our experience ...    Location: For us, the location was fantastic - right across from Kuhio Beach, in a somewhat quieter section of Waikiki than, for example, the Royal Hawaiian, but not as quiet as the Hilton Hawaiian Village and the Ilikai area (where we also stayed on our return from Maui). We bought groceries at the Food Pantry, a nice, short walk (about 5 minutes) and, of course, there were about 4 ABC stores within 1 minute walk. To see Oahu (and snorkel at Hanauma Bay) we rented a car for part of the stay - the Hertz agency was in the Hyatt which is right next door.    Condo: The condo was spacious and very quiet. There are 2 units per section, with 2 sections per floor separated by a breezeway. Elevators arrived within a minute or 2. We were greateful for the washer and dryer and the fully equipped kitchen. Sitting on the lanai having coffee, eating breakfast, and watching the surfers was such a pleasant way to start each day. The lanai was large and comfortable and we watched the most beautiful sunrises and sunsets, and on one side had a view of Diamond Head.    Staff: As has been said by many, the staff are friendly and helpful, especially the valet. By the same token, we experienced the ""aloha spirit"" from virtually everyone we met in the service industry (e.g., gas station attendants, the clerks at the Food Pantry and ABC stores, restaurant staff), on the beach, at Hanauma Bay, etc.    The one area that was inconsistent for us was the cleanliness of the condo. We noticed that on at least one occasion the toilet was not cleaned; on another, the floor was not vacuumed; and, as far as we could tell, the tub was not cleaned at all while we were there. On the other hand, the kitchen was always cleaned and supplies refilled. Nor did we say anything at the time, which we probably should have.

The housekeeping staff kept our apartment clean and tidy everyday along with little bedtime snacks for the kids. They were very kind and accommodating with our comings and goings.  Hotel: I can’t emphasize enough how great this location is. It is exactly 74 steps from the lobby to putting your toes in the sand at the beach. We loved the view and found there to be no noise from the air conditioners nearby, however we were on the 36th floor which may have helped with that. The balcony is enormous! We sat out there every morning and had our coffee, then every evening having our wine. Very calm, hardly a hint of a breeze. There are many places to dine, fancy or fast food nearby and of course an ABC store at almost every corner.    Transportation: Take an ABC Limo (Melvin) to and from the airport. It’s not a whole lot more than a taxi and it’s a nice way to start the holiday. We even requested a bottle of chilled champagne which was very welcome after a 5 hour delay in travel, which to our great pleasure the ABC crew was aware of and were still there to greet us 5 hours after we were scheduled to arrive. The lei’s were lovely and fragrant as well. Our only glitch was on our return trip to the airport – Melvin forgot about us, but with one quick phone call from us – and he was there to pick us up within 5 minutes and refused to take payment for the return trip.

The two-bedroom unit was great, had everything we needed to be very comfortable (kitchen, washer/dryer), location right across from the beach and right on the main drag in Waikiki was great. The hotel is nice, clean, obviously well kept, but not a luxury place. The staff was very helpful, everyone we met. For a family trip where having a home-like room is valuable I would recommend highly. The only (small) thing we didn't like was that the front desk attendant tried to convince us to upgrade from partial view to full view at check-in, and when we declined they put us in a full view anyway and it was clear (we had some items pre-delivered and they were in the room) we were getting the upgrade whether or not we paid, this rubbed me the wrong way but is a small thing and all the other service we got was uniformly excellent.",Oct 2011,October 2011,Traveled with family,,Connecticut

We were checked in very quickly and we were taken to our room and shown around by a member of the staff. Our luggage followed minutes later and was brought directly to our room.

118496506,50,Amazing experience!!!,"My wife and I visited Waikiki several weeks ago to celebrate our wedding and honeymoon. As you can imagine, our hotel choice was a pretty big decision for us to make. As it turned out we decided to stay at the Aston Beach Tower based on a recommendation made by our travel agent. Let me just say up front that I’m so glad that we did, as every aspect of the hotel is amazing.  For starters, the staff was truly amazing and really went out of their way to make sure we enjoyed every aspect of our visit. I do want to take a moment to mention some of these people, as they were truly instrumental to our experience. When we initially booked our stay, Regan, the hotel manager, gladly handled our call and notated every request that we made. In addition, my wife called several times after the initial booking to either change or add additional requests, and Regan not only handled those, but remembered all of our previous requests and ensured that they had been taken care of (which they had).Regan knew the significance of our trip, and my wife and I truly appreciated all of his efforts to make our trip absolutely amazing. If we had it to do all over again, we would not have changed a thing.  In addition to Regan, there were several other staff members that I feel a need to mention. I will honestly say that some of the best people we met on our entire trip were the members of the valet team at our hotel, specifically Eddie, Greg and Ed. In addition to retrieving and parking our car quickly, they also went out of their way to make sure we knew our surrounding area and the best possible routes to take for each venue that we wanted to visit. Eddie provided us with great info on local restaurants to visit which we would not have known about without him… And they were great by the way. I also feel the need to mention Russ who is another member of the parking crew. Although he was polite and professional, it seemed like Russ looked for ways to tell me why he could not help me as opposed to just doing what I asked. Obviously, I’m not very well versed in the standard operating procedures of valet parking, but I thought his reasoning for not complying was a little excessive and unnecessary. None of the other gentlemen listed earlier had any problems with my requests and handled them without any hesitation. I would say that he was the only downside of our stay at the Aston Tower.  As for the hotel itself, the rooms are very spacious and provide a great atmosphere for your vacation. The view is truly magnificent no matter where you stay in the hotel, and all of the rooms have dual access to the balcony which is a really nice feature. Each room is fully equipped with a kitchen (with cookware) and a washer/dryer set, and all of the necessities are provided free of charge. The hotel also has some great addition amenities which include its own beach access, complimentary beach towels and shower areas to wash off at after you return from the beach. As you can probably tell, everything you need is taken care of for you, so you’re only job while at the Aston is to relax and enjoy your trip.  All in all, I would recommend anyone and everyone to stay at the Aston Beach Tower on their trip to Waikiki. It’s absolutely amazing in every aspect and I promise that you will not be disappointed… The decision is truly a no-brainer!",Sep 2011,August 2011,Traveled as a couple,"Their is a smaller hotel in front of this hotel, so if you stay above floor 18, you'll be fine","Richmond, Virginia"
118427846,40,Great apartment but....,My husband and I stayed at this apartment complex last week and we agree with all the good reviews. The rooms were spacious with nice furniture and the kitchen was so well equiped it made it very easy to cater for ourselves if we wanted to. We could not fault the staff who were very helpful and friendly.  Our only criticisms were that we thought the complex was right on the beach but there was a road between the building and the beach which during the day had a lot of traffic on it so sitting on the balcony was noisy. We unfortunately also picked a week when they were replacing the footpath which added to the noise. The main reason the noise was so loud was we were on the 7th floor which led to another problem. If you look at the picture on their webpage you will see a very strategically placed sailboard that strangely enough blocks out the hotel off to the right of the building. If you are below about the 14th floor and on the right hand side of the building you are about only 80 feet away from other apartments who can look into you and you into them which kind of destroyed the feeling of privacy and also blocked all the view that way. Be aware also that they take an additional imprint of $100 on checking in for incidental expenses. Unfortunately for us they did not inform us they were doing this and as we paid on a debit card we lost access to that $100 while we were there and the reversal did not occur until we were back in Australia so were left with $100 of american money we could not use.  I would recommend staying at the Beach Towers but only if you have a room above the 14th floor.,Sep 2011,September 2011,Traveled as a couple,only take rooms above the 14th floor,"Melbourne, Australia"

118043601,40,Very good condo experience with excellent service,"The two bedroom/two bath condo was spacious and ultimately comfortable. We were in 3201 and had a view straight out and toward Diamond Head -- great view of the surfers and the swimming areas directly below (across the street). They have updated this unit, but there are little things which show the age of the building. The service was fantastic -- from check-in to maintenance to valet. OH! The noise was really loud from the air handling units on the building across the street and below us. These was a definite turn-off if you paid top dollar for the unit or tried to entertain on the lanai or with the doors open. Perhaps the units on the other side (Ewa direction) have less noise competition? (we cannot verify this).",Sep 2011,August 2011,Traveled with family,,"Naples, Florida"
116958614,40,"Good location, parking, staff.","We are a family of 5. We took the two bedroom suite on the 18th floor. We got some savings off the rate by using our Entertainment card.    PROS:  --This is a CONDO property so some would argue that you can't expect any quality service because you are staying in someone's home.  Well, the staff here is 4-5 star!  They even called around for dinner reservations after making excellent suggestions.  Except for one issue I had (more later),  I always got a follow-up call after the quick turnaround of requests I had (the wifi doesn't work, may I have another box of Tide, etc)  --Without too much traffic, the ride to Pearl Harbor was about 20 minutes.  --The 2 bedroom suite is big and has a nice, diverse view including beach, crater, and city. The bedding configuration was perfect, two twins, a pullout, and a king size.  --The washer/dryer was bigger than I'm used to seeing in-room.  --The TV was weirdly awesome-- I think it's 3D!  --The balcony was nice including one lounge chair you could prop your feet onto.  --The valet was prompt; parking free so tip the terrific bell staff nicely!  --There is a lot to do/eat/shop within walking distance. At night there is outdoor entertainment not too far away.  --As busy as this section of Waikiki is, our suite was pretty quiet.    CONS (mostly minor):  --I liked the beach-- more sandy, a little more wavy-- in front of the Hyatt better, barely a one block walk from the hotel. This preference was in no way a dealbreaker to cause switching to the Hyatt.  --The furnishings in my suite were somewhat drab.  --You can't really hear the lap of the surf.  --The pool is tiny-- but c'mon, you've got a beach!  --Beware the staff's recommendations for a good beach! Three different, good-natured people at different times at the front desk suggested beaches that I researched and read that inexperienced people with kids (namely, us) could be hurt or killed: Sandy (aka BREAK NECK), Makapu'u (deemed for experts only), and Halona (no facilities, guards, and a slippery, sharp, steep, rocky path to climb). The beach in front was nice and so was Kailua, about 30 minutes away.  --The one bad spot:  The bed in the master bedroom was lumpy and I couldn't get good sleep. I called about it the first day and the staffer said uncharacteristically unkindly that the rooms are privately owned and there was nothing that could be done (no room change was offered.) I suggested a board to slip under the mattress and they quickly arranged that but the bed remained lumpy. The night before we checked out, a kinder staffer said that he had heard complaint of the same by another guest who chose to sleep on the pullout coach. This was not an option for us; my teenager was using that bed.

116139229,40,Great family holiday at the Aston Wiakiki Beach Tower,"Our family of 5, stayed in a two bedroom ocean-view apartment in July. Everything about this property is absolutely fantastic for a family - although the apartments are a bit dated (dark wood etc). The apartment easily slept 5 of us and had everything we needed - two bedrooms and two bathrooms (and 3 TVs, for those that need them) which is very unusual for a beachfront property on Waikiki. Also a washing maching and dryer, which comes in useful with a family. The locattion is brilliant, the staff are extremely friendly and helpful and the free parking was an real bonus. The kitchen contained everything we needed to cook when we wanted to eat in - including a good size fridge, freezer, full oven and cooktop etc. As an added bonus for apartments - our rooms very serviced daily with a turndown service at night. No in house restaurant or room service, but this wasn't a problem for us as there are heaps of restaurants close by - and Mc Donalds is down below in case of extreme emergency!!!! If these apartments were updated to the latest decor they would be 5 star plus. The guys on the bell-desk were great - a real asset to the property.

115165918,50,We loved the view and the location.,"We stayed in the beautifully remolded unit #1903 at the Aston Wakiki Beach Tower. The view was better than the pictures because we were actually right there to enjoy it. We were right across the street from Waikiki Beach and we never wanted to leave. I haven't seen the other Condos on the property, but this one is immaculate.    It has Flat sceen TVs and Wi Fi internet. The Master Shower is great with it's 2 shower-heads. (THE ""RAINFALL SHOWERHEAD"" is the best) . It was wonderful to wake up in the Master Bedroom to an amazing view of Waikiki Beach without getting out of bed. The Condo had all the utensils we needed to prepare meals in the Condo. We could enjoy breakfast, lunch and dinner with a wonderful unobstucted ocean view right from our Condo (that means that no other buildings were blocking our view of the ocean). We loved making Margaritas in the blender and just sitting on the balcony.    When we did get out, we were right on Kalakaua Ave and we could walk just about everywhere. My wife wanted to spend sometime traveling to the North Shore so we rented a car for a couple of days. The Waikiki Beach Tower has valet parking, but this condo has its own parking spot in the building so we didn't even need the valet. Parking is free with the condo. I guess that's because #1903 is rented privately and not part of the Hotel itself. We definately recommend ""Waikiki Beach Tower 1903"" and we will be staying there again next time we visit Waikiki",Jul 2011,June 2011,Traveled as a couple,,"Los Angeles, California"
114952391,50,The rave reviews are all true - our high expectations were fully met!,"We had read others' reviews of Aston’s Waikiki Beach Tower and, to be honest, thought they were American exaggerations. But from the moment we arrived we realised it was all true and more!  If you want a serviced suite with every modern convenience this is the pick of the bunch, and we’ve been around. The full kitchen in our two bedroom deluxe apartment included a double-door refrigerator with ice and water dispenser, 1300W microwave oven, conventional oven/ceramic halogen cooktop (download Whirlpool Accubake manual from the Web as the in-room instructions relate to some other appliance!), dishwasher, toaster, coffee maker, and rice cooker. We also enjoyed a DVD player and over 200 channels of cable TV in each bedroom as well as the living room, plus washer/dryer unit, iron and ironing board, clock radio, and in-room safe plus ducted rangehood, Insinkerator, airconditioning in all sleeping and living areas, magnificent view overlooking Waikiki Beach (as well as a great view out the kids’ room, looking up the mountain), free valet parking, free beach towels, free bucket, spade and model boat for the kids, pool and spa, and terrific staff. This is the only place we’d choose when we return to Honolulu!    If we had to find anything to be pernickety about (which we don’t, but we know Michael appreciates the feedback) there was only a handful of small things, such as the lateness of the housekeeping (usually between 3 pm and 4 pm), the lack of decent water pressure in the shower, the 512K slightly slow Internet access, and the need to run the dishwasher twice a day due to there being insufficient place settings to accommodate even two meals for a family of four.    It’s important to manage people’s expectation levels so we don’t want people to be disappointed, but we can really only find superlatives springing to mind. We have had a fantastic time here for almost a week and felt right at home very quickly. The kids are fussy eaters but with the facilities for self-catering we were fine, with plenty of eat out options when they’d earned a treat. For those with a car, shop at Safeway but make sure you apply for a Safeway Club card (cite the Aston as your address!) as you will save huge $ on your shopping. On our initial grocery shop to stock the pantry we saved over $45 with our club card!    For rental cars choose Hertz or Budget as they both have a service desk at the Hyatt Regency which is in the next block. The one way fee of $15 is cheaper than the cab fare if, like us, you’re departing by ship and not by air.    In summary, a most enjoyable holiday in a magnificent apartment. We’ll definitely be back!

114391995,40,Loved Turning 60 at the 'Tower',"Celebrated by 60th Birthday with my first trip to Hawaii. Our travel agent (AAA) booked us in the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower. The staff commemorated my day with Champagne and a box of Godiva chocolates.    Perfect for us. We brought our two teenage grandchildren and they loved all the shops, beach and McDonalds! The area was such that they could have alot of freedom.    We had a two bedroom, two bath condo; very roomy and comfortable. Comfy beds and pillows made for good sleeping. The staff was so attentive. Anything that we needed or asked they actually seemed happy to assist us with.    After reading reviews on this site, I called & asked to ensure we had a renovated unit. Our unit had granite counter tops and newer appliances. The furniture was moderately worn but clean. The TVs were somewhat outdated, the air conditioning unit was rather noisy, and the master bath had a really noisy light fixture. But overall these things were minor and I would stay in that exact unit in a heartbeat! The housekeeping staff were great (and with two teenagers ...) You just leave the dishes in the sink and they put them in dishwasher when they refreshed the unit. Washer & dryer came in handy. We shopped at a local Safeway so some meals & snacks were available for the kids whenever they wanted.    Waikiki is a busy urban area, but we live in the country so it was a delightful change. The best thing was having the beach right there. I loved sitting on the large lanai and watching the ever-present surfers.

We stayed at a different place the year before and we found it to be so noisey. We could hear the people next to us all the time. At Aston Waikiki Beach Tower we never heard anybody and we had people next to us. I had great sleeps this time and I was on the pull out couch near the door. Plan on spending alot of time on the balcony to enjoy the view. Balcony is a good size. The four of us sat on it with alot of room to spare.    They also have a great Swimming pool area. Nice size pool and a hot tub. Lots of places to grab a lounger and sit in either the sun or shade. Very clean and well kept. They also had a pool table in this area but we did not use it. On the pool level they have change rooms and showers and a sauna.    All the staff were freindly and very helpful. The room was clean, you had maid service twice a day but we turned the night time one away alot as we didn't need it. The view was spetacular. We were across the road from Waikiki Beach which was great as we were there for the tsunami so we got to watch everything from our hotel balcony. (The staff was excellent through it..very patient with the worried tourists) The hotel is at the quieter end of the main drag which I preferred.    We rented a car for most of our trip. The hotel has valet parking at no charge! Unheard of in any other hotel. We tipped the valet of course but it beats paying $25 each day. They also have a stock of beach items you can borrow. Chairs, small boards, floating rings. Just ask.    If I had to dig for something I didn't like I would say the air conditioner had a loud rattle that kept me up a first until I just turned the air off at night. It was still cool in our room in the morning as the bedroom air (they were quiet) was on. Also, when you sit on the balcony you have to listen to the air conditioning running in the hotels around you as you are at their roof level. If that is something that would bother you just move up to a higher floor. But really, they are not bother some.    Don't be afraid of the price..we found it was cheaper than the hotel we originally had booked. You will have no regrets!",Jun 2011,March 2011,Traveled with family,,"St. Catharines, Canada"

113329878,40,"Great hotel, Great Location, Great for Families","We stayed at the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower in early June 2011. We booked a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom condo. Upon arrival, the valet was very friendly. At registration, the receptionist asked if we wanted to upgrade our room. We initially did not agree, but she went and spoke to her manager and he agreed to lower the extra price per day cost. We ended up with a room on the 29th floor. The hallways are VERY quiet as there are 2 towers and only 2 rooms per floor, so you don't have to worry about kids or drunken adults running or talking loud down the hallway late at night. Our room was VERY clean and equipped with everything we needed. The hotel has internet access but not wi-fi the rooms. A secret: the hotel does have a limited number of wi-fi modems available, so ask to see if one is available to be installed in your room.    Location wise, the Aston is in a great location. There's a McDonald's right around the corner and is on the main ""strip"" of Waikiki. Great for walking and sightseeing. Note to anyone driving: the auto-accessible entrance to the hotel is on a sidestreet. You will see the sign for Aston on Kalakaua but you have to make a left turn on Liliuokalani Ave.    The only gripe I had about the Aston is housekeeping. The first day, when we arrived back to our room around 6pm, no one had been there. Housekeeping quickly brought up a change of towels and removed the trash. Apparently they don't service the rooms until late in afternoon/evening. I asked if they could come earlier next time...and then she showed up at like 9:30 a.m. We asked her to come back around noon, and our room was serviced when we returned later that afternoon.    Overall, I loved my experience here. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.",Jun 2011,June 2011,Traveled with family,,Missouri
113328162,50,Perfect place for families.,"Our stay at the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower was perfect. As most reviewers have described, the service was perfect. Everyone from the front desk, to the valet/bellmen, and housekeeping. They were all so nice and genuine and went out of their way to help us.    Another great part about our stay was the room (condo). They were huge and had great views, we were on the 16 floor and there was a hotel partly blocking our view, but it didn't matter. The balcony was roomy and perfect for watching the waves and sunsets.  There were five people in our party, four adults and a baby. There was so much space for everyone. We even had a little play area for the baby. Often times our parents came to visit, and there was plenty of space to talk and just hang out. Because, our rooms were toward the back of the unit. We could actually talk while the baby slept. The kitchen was also extremely helpful. We could keep the baby and ourselves on a somewhat healthy diet. Plus, we often saved $$ by cooking and eating breakfast in our room.    My ideal place (when we can afford it) is a four star resort, so I was a little surprised at how much I loved having this home away from home. I would never stay anywhere else while visiting Waikiki.    Also the location was perfect. Walking distance to the zoo and all the Waikiki shopping and restaurants.    Just a note for those travelers who need a totally dark room. The master bedroom in our unit (1604) was a little bright.",Jun 2011,May 2011,Traveled with family,,"Corona del Mar, California"

The hotel has a very nice private pool, but the beach was so great we never used it. Surfing rentals and lessons are available in the blocks around the beach area. Kalakaua Ave. is full of upscale shops and restaurants. Always felt safe, police station is also across the street.    The hotel staff was one of the most professional we've encountered. From the desk staff, to the parking valets, to the housekeeping, everyone was friendly, polite, helpful, prompt, they even looked for reasons to upgrade us to an ocean view room.

112486952,50,Best place to stay with your family in Waikiki.,"This resort is like having a condo across from the beach. The living rooms are spacious, bathrooms clean, views are incredible and the staff is amazing. From the outside, it's unpretentious (almost) hidden driveway and lobby is calming. If your looking for the torch lined grand entrance with Christmas lights, music and quick moving tourist flooding the place- Aston Waikiki Beach Tower is not for you. If you want a place that's simple, easy to navigate with a small personal staff who will learn your name by the time you leave, then look no further.    Eddy, Greg, Tomo, Amy- they all came through with anything and everything my family needed. Maps, directions, recommendations, and laughs. Seriously people, these guys are professional but also genuine and real. My daughter and father loved the pool; the hot tub was my favorite as it never seemed crowded. Incredible restaurants and stores are on either side of the property, yet the rooms are equipped with everything you'll need to prepare a meal including pots, pans, blender, toaster, microwave, glasses, plates even dishes for baking...

The staff at the Beach Tower are very pleasant and helpful. The bell guys/valet are so nice and give great advice as to places to go.

Our water did not heat first day but the problem was fixed promptly and they gave us a credit on our room for the inconvenience. I slept really well there - beds are nice . Would stay again - teens loved the action on the strip and we could let them out to wander and do our thing . We met up for dinner. Great beach right in front of hotel.

I decided to walk over to the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower to check it out because I had read about it and liked the reviews. I met a lovely receptionist named Amy that took me for a tour of the rooms she had available and I took a room for four nights. It is a little pricey but I do not regret it for one moment. It was beautiful and I felt very secure at this hotel. There was an unfortunate incident on the last night with a fire alarm that went off at 330 am and I had to walk down 31 flights of stairs with my 66 year old mother but fortunately it turned out to be a false alarm. Even though that happened I still felt compelled to write a review about how wonderful this property was because if it were not for others opinions I might have never had the pleasure of staying there.

101745322,50,Perfect Home Away from Home in Waikiki,"We recently spent 10 glorious days in Hawaiian paradise. We stayed at the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower and have nothing but accolades for this fine condo style hotel. This is a perfect spot to live while enjoying the sights of Honolulu. Our accommodations were spacious and comfortable with a living room, dining area, bedroom, bathroom, kitchen and large lanai. The kitchen was probably better stocked than many people's home kitchens. Laundry facilities were available right in your room. There were tvs in the living area and the bedroom (if you ever found time to watch them). Towels, soaps, coffee, etc. were amply replenished twice daily. A grocery delivery service was also an option of which we took full advantage. An ABC store with its huge array of goods was conveniently located next door and was certainly not as pricey as we were led to believe.The view from our room was amazing, looking right on Waikiki beach and the beautiful ocean. The location was centrally within walking distance to almost all of Honolulu's major attractions, plus we were right next door to the shuttle pickup area for those attractions which were farther afield. The staff are applauded for their excellent service, from the friendly front desk folks to the efficient cleaning staff to the competent gentlemen at the bell desk. Little extras like daily hotel-produced Hawaiian info notices, morning newspaper delivery and nightly turndown service with treats were appreciated. Even though this hotel is right on the main thoroughfare, it is surprisingly quiet and we spent many contemplative moments out on the lanai enjoying the Hawaiian sunshine and planning our next trip back here.

There is free valet parking, free use of beach towels, chairs, laundry detergent, etc. They switched our condo to a higher unit and gave us a really late check out for our late flight. They were most helpful and courteous. Couldn't ask for better service. My lower rating is only due to the fact that our condo, while spacious and well furnished, was very outdated. The cabinets were warped and the wood was actually flaking off in places. The carpet was old and warn. The appliances were old. It just looked tired and worn. It was also quite dusty and not as clean as I would have expected. This may have been due to the fact that we changed from our original room so they did not have the chance to dust. As each unit is separately owned, it may be that this one unit is the exception, not the rule. However, for the price, I would have expected all units to be newer looking and feeling. Or maybe they could offer a lower price for the outdated units. Too bad, as the service can't be beat, Really. Hats off to them for getting that right. Maybe they just need to convince their owners to update their units.

The suite was beautifully decorated, well equipped, lots of pillows available and we loved the treats left by the cleaning staff each day. The staff service was amazing. We never waiting more than 2 minutes for our car. I can't imagine a better location. I don't think that hotels ""on the beach"" are closer. It was close enough that the kids could run back to the room if they needed to go to the bathroom. Also, we didn't have to pay for any extras - free valet parking, use of safe, internet, etc.  The first morning we were up early so we went to the beach and Star Beach Boys were already there so we had the ""early bird"" surf lessons. $30 a person and we had 2 instructors - one for the kids, one for the adults. We all got up on the first or second try, then many more.  We walked to every restaurant we wanted to go to, and Safeway was a short drive.

We had originally made reservations at the Aston Sunset a few blocks away but received a surprising free upgrade to the Beach Tower upon arrival. So we never saw our Sunset suite but the Beach Tower suite was incomparable. It was large and comfortable. The bed afforded great sleep after day's full of activities. We used the kitchen minimally but it was great to be able to cook and reheat food for breakfast while baby took morning nap! Bathrooms were updated tho kitchen was not. I understand that the hotel tower is being renovated suite by suite. Lanai was huge and faced Kuhio Beach. We saw sunsets from our balcony and greeted sunrise and early surfers every morning. We faced popular surf spots so baby and I watched my husband surf every morning. It was great. Location is awesome too - so easy to take quick walks along Kalakaua - the main retail street. Kuhio is also a retail street but more low-key. Staff was very attentive - from front desk to bellboy to room service.

98030400,50,OUr 1st choice for Waikiki accommodation,We have stayed in Waikiki on seven occasions and the last 2 times have chosen to stay at the Waikiki Beach Tower. We originally chose the complex as we wanted some extra room that you can not find in a hotel but also wanted to be close to the beach and main restaurant area.  With Waikiki Beach Tower both of these criteria are well and truly satisfied. The condos are very spacious and clean with great balconies to enjoy the stunning view. Added to that is that you are right across from the beach and within easy walking distance of the main section of Kalakaua Ave. Being at this end of the street means things are also a little quieter.  The service and staff on both occasions have been wonderful and friendly.

Well, of course it was awesome and we were celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary, so we took it-for a good price but still very pricey! We knew we may never get back to Hawaii and we could afford it. If you view my pictures, you'll see why it was worth it. Our 16 yr old son and 13 yr old daughter were with us, so we needed two bedrooms and separate beds for them. Our son loved the condo so much that he started out sleeping on the lanai every night! We stayed 3 nights at this place and spent 2 weeks in various parts of Hawaii, and he said it was the best part of the trip! The room we were in had a Bose radio, beautiful kitchen, washer and dryer, and a feature you wouldn't think you would need in Hawaii but I loved...a heated toilet seat! The toilet was very fancy! We loved the views the best and slept with our lanai doors open the entire time we were in the condo! We had a master bedroom with a beautiful view and lanai. We had a view of Diamond Head from our lanai. We were within walking distance of the famous Banyan Tree and many shops. The beach is right across the street, just steps away. There is also a nice pool, but we never swam in it. We had free valet parking with our condo which was nice (of course we still tipped!).

The location is fabulous, and anything you could want is within a few blocks of the hotel – from a quick Subway sandwich to a high-end dinner. The big resorts further west on Waikiki all seemed ""self contained,"" and we really liked being in the thick of the town, shopping, restaurants, etc.    We were very pleased with our choice of the Waikiki Beach Tower, and really appreciated a few of the things you would not get at a big chain: complimentary valet parking, washer/dryer in the unit, nightly turndown with sweets (especially the chocolate covered macadamia nuts), and full digital cable package.    We stayed at another Aston property on Maui (the Mahana) the week after we left Waikiki and thought the service and friendliness at Waikiki Beach Tower were much better. Staff remembered us, asked about our plans so they could park the car in the most efficient spot, and all-in-all seemed happy and eager to be of assistance.

95531449,50,Fantastic Condo Hotel,"This Hotel is fantastic, it is just over the road from Waikiki Beach. The concierges and staff are all very helpful and friendly. The drive in entrance to the hotel would be a little tricky to find so if you are driving yourself ask for directions to the driveway. McDonalds is just in front of the hotel and there are several ABC stores within easy walking distance. The best place to catch the Bus is a couple of blocks behind the hotel, ask the concierge. Diamond Head is only open Friday,Saturday and Sunday at the moment so check before you go up there. Tours tend to pick you up at either the Pacific Beach Hotel which is next door (across the road) or on the street behind the hotel, ask for the specific pick up place to wait because we waited just near the entrance to our hotel (on the side road) and the drivers always seemed to be at the Pacific Beach Hotel and we usually had to find the bus and wait for the driver. The restaurants in  Waikiki book up really fast my suggestion is to book ahead, so if you arrive in the morning it is worth going for a walk down the main street and booking a restaurant for dinner, we went to about 6 restaurants on our first night in Waikiki before we found one with an available table. We also prebooked for other nights as well. The Concierges are happy to book activities and tours for you as well as Shuttles to take you where you want to go. We caught shuttles to Waikele Outlets, Fleamarkets and Pearl Harbor. If you are using the shuttles try not to change the pick up time as you end up waiting around for them to come from somewhere else as they plan their day on the first time you agreed on.",Feb 2011,January 2011,Traveled with family,,"Canberra, Australia"

Both bedrooms were spacious and clean, the kitchen was well-equipped, you could eat outside on the lanai or inside. The aircon worked very well as did all electric and electronic appliances. Wifi was available on the 4th floor recreational area and in the lobby. The bed, btw was very comfortable and we slept very well. The suite was cleaned well by housekeeping who also asked you in the evening if you had any requirements. There is a very large Safeway about 5mins drive away. The beach is just across the road and you can borrow beach towels from the bell desk as you go out. The beach tower is slightly set back from the road so because of the location you could retire to your apartment or you could be ""right in amongst it"". There's plenty to look at in Waikiki during the day and in the evening! The personnel at the bell-desk, the concierge and housekeeping were excellent, Front desk efficient with checking in and out.

It was myself, husband, 2 kids in one room, then my brother, his wife, my mom in another room.    We booked through a travel agent, and wanted to get rooms toward the bottom, easier for elevators, etc...We got the 5th floor. From the website it makes it look like this hotel is right smack on the beach....it's not. It is across the street. So the pictures online that show a couple overlooking the water, it is a little deceiving.    The room for my brother was much nicer than ours. Theirs looks like the one online, ours was very outdated. However, their room had many things break down on them...locked bedroom door, fridge issue, and the worst was the overflowing of their bathroom sink due to the room (I think above them). But, the hotel was always quick to fix everything and was very nice. We never had any issues with our room.    The lanais are HUGE. Great to open the door and have our boys run around outside. They have twice daily maid service which is great. Loved getting chocolate treats each night!    We had a full kitchen which was great. We made a trip to the store for breakfast items. But, being a first time visit to Hawaii I wanted to eat out all the time. LOVED everything I ate. There is a coffee shop right across the street which had tasty baked goods.    Loved having a laundry facility in our room. Was perfect with small kids!! Our sleeping arrangements were a master bedroom/bath, and twin beds in the other room with a bath right near that. It was kind of loud at night with traffic/tour buses and that started again around 6 am. I almost felt like the windows were open it was so loud. But, I had no trouble sleeping. The beds were very comfortable as well as the linens.    The staff was very helpful/friendly. I could never find a good deal on the attractions we wanted to go to from concierge, but that was fine. I also could never find a restaurant to honor the kids eat free with the lanyard, but no big deal either. The kids got a beach bucket/toys upon checkin. The beach is RIGHT across the street. It was great! We could easily walk through the flowered trellis and cross the street to the beach, even for quick dips into the water. My husband took the boys out and saw great fish in the water.    There is an ABC store very close by, a few really. Great for little things we needed. For those new to the area, they have cold food, snacks, toiletries, souvenirs, etc....Not a big grocery store, but a large convenience store.    Getting our rental car for excursions was very easy, friendly staff.    The rate for the room was kind of expensive, but we had such a great time on our vacation. We toured all over Oahu and fell in love with this island!!! The hotel was perfect for us. We kind of felt like it was home for our week we were there.    Our hotel was walking distance to the zoo and aquarium which was fun for a few little adventures with the kids. We brought our letterboxing journals and were able to get stamps from a couple places. Fun for the kids!    I think I would stay there again, but also interested in maybe another part of the strip, or even another island.

Each Of our 3 rooms comfortably slept 4-5 people--master had king bed, 2nd room had two twin beds and pull out couch in living room area. Kitchen was fully equipped with full stove/oven, microwave and refrigerator. A huge plus when you can eat some of your meals In the room and not in the in the expensive beach area. Location was awesome. All we had to do was cross the street at the stoplight and we were on the famous Waikiki Beach.  Hotel staff was amazing! From the first day, any questions we had or issues that came up they were more than happy to help us. Only downside that I could think of was that they Did not offer wi-fi in rooms. Wi-fi was available in the lobby and game/pool area.

Lovely amenities, gorgeous views...you never were left wanting for anything. From the front desk to the valets, we received friendliness to the 100th degree.

88838646,50,Great place spectacular location,"November 2010 we took our Mom to hawaii for her 80th birthday, and this is the place i choose for us to stay and im sooo sooo glad i did. We loved everything about this place, upon check in we were told we could upgrade our room 5 floors higher for 500.00 more i found that to be a bit extreme so we said no, while outside waiting for the check in a gentleman came out and told us that he could upgrade for 250.00 this sounded a bit better after all this is all for Mom so we said yes, this put us on the 27th floor and the view was to die for. This is on Kalakaua Avenue which runs along waikik beach so there was nothing but ocean view!  The rooms are large have full kitchen, fridge has ice and water, washer dryer, 2 bdrms, 2 full baths, safe lots of room for hanging you clothes 3 full closets. They refill everything everyday so if you use your laundry soap there is no need to buy anymore. Turn down at nite.. Large lanai with window from kitchen opening onto deck, there is just nothing about this place we did not like at all... Service was great loved the people who worked here it was almost hard leaving them. The only downside is and this is really nothing at least to us is this is a Condo hotel so there is no restaraunt on site DO NOT order from the menu in room, not only is this wayyyy overpriced like 30 dollars for bacon and eggs but food comes from somewhere else. This is within walking distance of everything Kuhio beach is directly acoss the street and waikiki beach about 1 block away... Great place..

I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again. The management and staff was phenomonal! Everyone was so friendly and Regan went out of his way to ensure our stay was excellent. The rooms have very up-to-date decor and are very spacious. Each room has a nice lanai with a table and chairs, so if you choose to eat outside, covered from the sun and enjoying the view of the ocean/beach, it is very easy to do so. Just having a fully-equipped kitchen when traveling with children is a blessing. Each room has a washer and dryer, so that was helpful when it came time to pack for the trip. Maid service came every day. Beach towels were available at the concierge, so no need to pack those. The beach across the street was clean and very kid-friendly, but the hotel has a pool and hottub, if you need a change of pace from the beach. There was so much in walking distance from the hotel.

86217152,40,Good location,"This is our last stop in Hawaii before heading back to the mainland. We drove from North shore (Turtle Bay resort) which took us approximately an hour to the Waikiki beach tower. We choose this condo for the complimentry valet parking and comfort of home; the three nights stay are for business this time) Upon arrival we were greeted by the valet, and our rental car and luggages were taking of. We knew that we had arrived early and decided to have lunch at a Japanese restaurant down the block. At approximately 2 PM our room was ready and we were assigned to room 2401 on the 24th floor. I was very impressed with the valet and bellhop service; everything was done in an expeditious and profesional manner. Our one bedroom was clean with good view of Waikiki beach; kitchen is nice and fully equiped. However, we never use the kitchen because of our schedule and the fact that we rather dine in the vicinity of Waikiki beach; plenty of restaurant to choose from. The unit has very good sound proof glass door; on the lanai you could hear the constant air duct noise from the hotel on the next block. Perhaps higher floor would not be as bad. We usually leave the condo around 9:00 AM every morning and valet would have our car ready within 2 minutes. When we returned at the condo at 3PM the unit are thoroughly cleaned. Every evening we would have nice dinner in the vicinity and when we returned housekeeping would have completed the turndown service. We had a very good stay at this resort, we were able to work, shop and play at the same time. My compliment to the management and staff.

We had a partial ocean view room on the 10th floor which was comfortable and had everything we needed, this was our home for three weeks so I can assure you it had to be good. We had no adverse loud noise from other rooms or from outside. The views from the lanai were breathtaking and enjoyed every morning for a leisurely breakfast. The hotel's location is brilliant for the beach which is just across the road and also for the bus and if taking tours most are picked up just at the back of the hotel shops close by as well as plenty of restaurants to satisfy all pockets but i seriously cannot say enough good things about the hotel and it's staff I have visited Oahu many times and stayed in many hotels, some of which are no longer around but i can safely say the Aston Waikiki Beach Towers is the best , don't confuse it with the Aston Waikiki Beach which is 2 blocks down and nearer the zoo make sure you book the beach towers",Oct 2010,September 2010,Traveled with family,,"London, United Kingdom"

81794062,50,We loved everything about this hotel.,"The Waikiki Beach Tower was a wonderful place to stay in Waikiki. Its location was ideal because it was directly across the street from Kuhio Beach and a short 2 or 3 block walk to the large hotels and busier area. The Trolley (which we didn't use) runs close by. The ocean view in the deluxe unit was unobstructed from the bedroom, living room, and kitchen and lanai. The condo had good sized rooms and updated kitchen and bathroom. (Not all units are updated.) We only needed one bedroom and one bathroom so they blocked off the other bedroom and bath (all condos are 2 bedrooms and 2 baths). The staff made us feel like royalty and were very friendly and helpful. The building felt very private and safe and was well maintained. We did not use the pool which was on the 4th floor level - outdoors. The driveway is on a side street which initially made it hard to find while driving.

We really loved the free valet parking which allowed us to easily park our rental car safely at night and be able to explore the rest of the island during the day.

It was not a big deal really but when they found out it would take more than a day to fix they opened up the second bathroom for us to use at no cost which helped tremendously with 4 people. 3 different people called to make sure it was fixed. The bellhops out front were fantastic. We quickly became friends with all of them and they helped with directions, local places to go to eat, etc. Also when you go to pick up towels for the beach ask if they have beach chairs and mats.

The bedrooms and bathrooms were average sized, the kitchen was a bit tiny yet had a view to the beach, and the living room was huge. We had a lanai as well.

75992060,50,8th and counting,"We love, love, love Aston Waikiki Beach Tower! We just returned from a 4-night stay in August. Since we usually visit 2 islands per trip, we stay in a hotel for the first island and always return to Waikiki Beach Tower. The proximity to the beach, the breathtaking view of Diamond Head & Waikiki, the friendly service and spacious rooms are just a few things that draw us back each year. You'd be hard pressed to find any condos/hotels that are this spacious at this price range. And it is located directly across from the beach. So, no driving, no parking hassles to get to a beach. In fact, they keep a storage of boogie boards, mats, and other beach gears that you can borrow during your stay. (Many guests donate their almost new boards when they leave).    The staff at Waikiki Beach Tower is always professional and friendly - especially those guys at the bell desk. They embody the spirit of Aloha. One of our favorite things to do in Hawaii is to have breakfast at lanai while enjoying the gorgeous view.    Most of the rooms have been recently renovated, and I noticed that the unit we stayed this time (#4002) had brand new mattresses! Thank you for that! The bathroom fixtures are not exactly what you would find at 5 star hotel, but they are certainly acceptable. Their service and location definitely rank 5 stars. It is also convenient that each unit has its own washer & dryer.    On a totally different subject, if you do stay in the Waikiki Beach Tower (or elsewhere in Oahu), do try malasadas from Leonards' Bakery - located within 10 minute drive from the condo. Malasadas are Portugese version of jelly donuts. I'm usually not a fan of donuts, but they were so delicious! There is usually a long line at the store, but it is worth the wait.

75522888,50,Best Vacation of our Lives,"When we arrived to check into a sister property, we were told we were being upgraded. At first, we were a little nervous because we had carefully chosen the sister property to accomodate our family of 5 (with two 16 year old and our 17 year old sons). When we arrived at the Beach Tower hotel, we were astonished. The condo was beaufiful ~ better than anywhere we have ever stayed as a family. The full kitchen was fully stocked. The unit also had a washer/dryer right in our condo. Our balcony overlooked the beautiful sandy beach. Every morning, I enjoyed my coffee while watching the sun come up. Beds were comfortable; two bathrooms gave us the gift of space. Closet space, living room, entry ... everything was better than we could have hoped for.    Staff were friendly, knowledgeable, and very helpful with everything. Housekeeping staff were invisible and surpassed any expectations we may have had. Front desk staff and the concierge were instrumental in finding us both a minor injury clinic and transportation when one son was slightly injured. Much to our surprise, it was the bellmen who were incredible! Their professionalism, courtesy, and friendliness made us feel like we were family members. When we asked for activity suggestions, they assisted us in both choosing and then booking fabulous (and very reasonable) tours and activities throughout our stay. (Don't bother with the trip/activity vendors on the street - you will be much happier with the recommendations of the bellmen.)    After checking out at noon on our departure day, we knew the hotel would keep our luggage until our flight left later that night. We didn't expect to be offered towels and the use of showers at the end of the day - but were very pleased to be able to take advantage of that extra perk.    Since our sons will be heading to college beginning next year, this was quite possibly our last family vacation.

Location is a block away from the International Market and just a short walk to many restaurants. Free parking/valet service at the Beachtower is definitely a plus in often crowded and hard to find parking around Waikiki. I felt like a VIP during my stay.

About 15 mins walk from the international market. They are not really a hotel, so can't compare the services to a hotel, but the room was fantastic, especially for a family. Room was comfortable, not the newest, but didn't look dated at all. I would highly recommend this apartment if you don't require the services of a 5 star hotel, though they do have a concierge who was very helpful.

69826208,40,"Great view, clean room","We stayed at this condotel in July for 4 nights. The hotel is located in the heart of Waikiki directly across the street from a very swimmer friendly beach area. Another reviewer described it as a ""pool"" and that's an accurate depiction. The swiming area is surrouned by a rock wall barrier that makes the water very, very calm and it's very warm. Great restaurants are a short walk in either direction, and you're right there in the middle of the action. The view from the lanai was amazing, absolutely breathtaking.    The room was very clean albeit a little dated. But even still, I can't stress enough how clean it was and the cleanliness did make up for the decor. We stayed in a 2BR condo. MIL and our 6YO son shared the second BR with 2 twin beds. Their beds were so comfortable. My husband and I were in the master bedroom with a king bed. I have two minor complaints (I'll get to the second later) about this property, and our bed is one of them. It was like sleeping on the floor it was just so, so hard. The pillows were wonderful, but the bed was awful. Our room was cleaned each morning, and we had turn down service each night and a little treat was left on each bed - a very nice touch that we all enjoyed.    There is a stacked washer and dryer in the unit. Very convenient and we utilized them. Just be prepared that they don't do full loads, so don't wait until the morning of check out to start doing your laundry. I left a note for housekeeping to leave us additional laundry detergent and they did, no problems there. The kitchen had everything you would need to cook, they really thought of everything. They even supply the coffee, powdered creamer, sugar and artificial sweetners.    Free parking (a huge bonus) and free internet make this a real value. Cable TV in each room. Air conditioning worked well. Oh, and TONS of closets. I was really pleasantly surprised by the amount of closet space, and hangers, in the unit.    This property, like all others in Hawaii, is non smoking. MIL is a smoker. Smokers must go out to the sidewalk to have a smoke, and they're directed by the bell staff to head across the street to the ABC Store where there is an ashtray outside. (There is not one there, btw, but she did find one down half a block in front of the hotel across the street.) I don't think it's a big deal to go outside, but I do think that the hotels, the Aston included, need to provide a receptical for their patrons. Like it or not, people smoke. If you don't make a provision for them, it's not going to stop them from smoking, they're just going to wind up snuffing their butts out on the ground with their shoe and leaving them there. I did notice a few people doing that, and it saddened me to see. It's an easily remedied situation -- just put an ashtray outside, and the smokers will use it.    All in all, we enjoyed our stay. It met all of our needs, and we were happy with the rate, the room and the property. This is a really great option for families or groups.",Jul 2010,July 2010,Traveled with family,,Bergen County NJ

Location: Across the street from the beach and"" beach pool"" (not sure what to call it, but its the area which the rocks gaurd the beach from the waves for families with toddlers can enjoy. Most of the beach is waist high with small fishes). It seems that anywhere within a block of the beach is close to ABC stores, restaurants and shopping. The only choice is to walk two blocks or less. Our hotel was across the street which was nice with our 3.5 year old daughter. We had an ocean view which was nice since we had breakfast in the hotel on the balcony.    Facilites: Simple pool and jacuzzi but area does get windy due to the buildings causing a wind tunnel effect. Not much else to write about that we used. They provide towels for beach use and give toys for kids to use on the beach. They also offer inflatables but limited choices.    Room (#701): We had a two bedroom for 5 adults and one child.

The pictures on the website were also very misleading. Probably will not stay here again.",Jun 2010,June 2010,Traveled with family,,"Anniston, Alabama"
67752290,50,It's tough to add more to the glowing comments from others,"As others have noted, we also loved our stay. We originally booked a hotel room at another location,but with a 19 year old son, and a 14 year old daughter, I got really concerned about spending 8 days in a hotel room with the 4 of us.    The Beach Tower was more expensive than the other choice, but I have no regrets upgrading to this hotel.    Even the partial ocean view was fabulous, it's super convenient to everything, and I consider the beach in front of the hotel as one of the best areas on all of Waikiki Beach.    We had limited exposure to the front desk staff, and did not use the concierge service, but I must especially point out the group in valet. The 3 we dealt with most were Ed, Eddy, and Greg, and I was won over in the first 10 minutes we were there by not only their helpfulness, but their genuine ""niceness"". We are members of the Disney Vacation Club and the ""friendliness"" there can at times seem a little fake. The valet group to me seemed very genuine, and I felt like they treated us as friends/family rather than us being their customers. In fact, my daughter commented on how she was wondering if Greg was a little sad when we left because every time she talked with him he seemed so genuinely concerned about how we were and what are plans were for the day. I'm sorry if I missed naming anyone in this valet group, everyone we dealt with was exceptional.    Housekeeping was also very good, and after our day at the beach I was delighted to see they even did a great job of cleaning up the entry way after we brought more sand back to the room with us than we intended. We had a couple of dishes near the sink, and when we got back they had loaded the dishwasher and started it to ensure we had clean dishes when we returned.    I have no hesitation recommending this hotel, in fact, we've been back 2 days and my kids are already asking if I can book this hotel again for our next trip to Hawaii.    With everything good, I need to mention a couple of not so good items. We had a couple of minor issues that didn't detract from our stay, but I should mention to provide a fair review. In general, the room we were in needs a little ""freshening"". The housekeeping group does a great job, but the furniture was somewhat worn, the carpets were obviously vacuumed but probably needed a deep clean as they were somewhat stained looking, and it looks like someone painted with white paint over a section of the ceiling that was extremely dirty or stained from the air conditioner vent, which made for a kind of shoddy look when first walking in.    Again, nothing major that detracted from our stay, but I wouldn't put the room condition (at least our room) on par with some of the Disney hotels we normally stay at.    We payed for an extra 8 hours in the room as our flight wasn't until 10:50 that night, but looking back it wasn't worth the extra money considering the valet group will store your luggage for you, and there are showers on the 4th floor for use if you need a shower before you leave to catch your plane. For others staying there it's nice knowing that they offer this if they have availability, but in hindsight it wasn't worth the money it cost.    Overall, location is perfect, staff is perfect, amount of space is perfect. Top notch overall, but the condition of our room was not up to par with the rest of the hotel.",Jun 2010,June 2010,Traveled with family,,"Prior Lake, MN"

The beach is across the street, activities pick-up was next door; everything we needed was close by.  The rooms were clean and large for our group of adult children no one felt crowded.  The full kitchen was great and cleaned daily. If I had one suggestion it would be to pick a higher floor (we were on 6) the day traffic is noisy, but we did not stay in the room that much during the day. At night all was quite.

We were, also, upgraded to an ocean view room. The entire staff was exceptionally courteous. There was free valet parking. There were six of us and we had plenty of room. My great pleasure was having coffee on the lanai each morning. The property is right accross from Waikiki beach and in the heart of the shopping district.

66478697,50,No better view & service in Waikiki,"For me, it's all about service, and this hotel/condo aces that test. From the folks at the front desk (please post baby pics when it arrives <grin>), to the concierge and bell staff, and the warm, attentive ladies in housekeeping, no one could possibly do it better.    The one-bedroom suite I had was on the 11th floor, with a glorious lanai and perfect ocean view. The room is large, with a sofa, chair & ottoman and television (wall-mounted flat screen, I think 32""). There is also a small desk/table with the wired Internet connection. Bring a wireless router if you don't want to plug in or if you want to connect more than one computer. Best thing ever: a hotel with PLENTY of electrical outlets!    The kitchen is well equipped with stove, oven, microwave, fridge (with ice maker), rice cooker, blender, toaster, dishes, glassware & cutlery. One note: the cooking pans all had warped bottoms, making them wobble unsafely on the smooth-top stove. If I'd planned on cooking more I would have found a WalMart and gotten a couple of pans.    The bathroom has double sinks and a large walk-in closet, with a separate room for the shower, toilet and stacked washer/dryer unit. The bathroom is off the bedroom, which is adequately sized with sliding door access to the lanai. My ONLY complaint was the bed. I could feel the springs in the mattress and the sheets were scratchy and rough. Plenty of nice pillows though!    Without question, an excellent place to stay, and I'll be back for sure!",Jun 2010,May 2010,Traveled solo,,"Portland, Oregon"
66265848,20,Hard Beds,The rooms were big with nice views but the beds feel like a sheet over springs and the bedspreads have been washed so many times they lost their softness.

Karin at the front desk was very helpful and located a wonderful condo for us.  This condo is in walking distance to dining, entertainment and shopping.  The bell staff was very efficent in bringing our car when we needed it. Parking is free.  The hot tub was nice and warm but the pool water was cold. Others pointed out that the pool deck is very windy and we found that to be true. Beach towels are free to use.  Our only small complaint was housekeeping. If you want your room cleaned when you leave in the morning call them. We returned one day at 3 pm to find that they still had not cleaned our room. When we called the front desk they were not the kindest and proceeded to tell me that it will get cleaned before 5 pm.  Be very careful with your credit card and check your statements closely.

62743833,50,Outstanding,"I would first like to thank all at the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower. We have never been escorted to our room and given a tour of the hotel at any other resort ever. From start to finish the staff was outstanding in service and quality. We went to Hawaii to celebrate my sons graduation, my daughters 16th birthday, our 20th anniversary and my husbands 50th birthday. They were unbelievable, truly. I never expected to get an upgrade which they offered graciously with a full view of the ocean. In addition, they gave us complimentary Godiva and champaign. Wow, what a start to the very best vacation we ever had!  Everyone at the tower was kind and friendly. We had originally thought about staying at another resort, however the hustle and bustle of big and commercial did not appeal to our vision of relaxation. Thus we ended up booking with The Aston Tower. I am so glad we did.  Anyone who wishes to make their dream come true in Hawaii, you must stay with the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower.

On our last day as we were leaving at night we were changed to room 2502 as they required our previous room for maintenance,the relief of a quiet room was satisfying but disappointing that we were denied a shift during our stay.

62112719,50,Travelling with kids - look no further,"The Aston Waikiki Beach Tower is everything that it claims to be. We spend 9 nights there at the start of April and it was fantastic. First of all we got upgraded because my husband had turned 50 the previous year and therefore we qualified for the 'senior' upgrade. We have children aged 10 and 14 and this accomodation suited them perfectly. The rooms were large and airy with a full kitchen , large lounge and great balcony (lanai). The view spectactular! But the service from the staff is the best - super friendly and helpful - nothing seems to be a problem. I had contacted them prior to our arrival and they organized a restaurant booking for us and helped us out with our trips around the island. The guys on the conceirge desk made it all so easy for us to find our feet around Oahu. Also this venue is right in the middle of everything.

61770822,50,Location and Staff Number ONE,"We had the priviledge of staying at the Beach Tower for 3nts at the end of our Hawaii vacation. First and foremost, the staff at this property is outstanding, from the Front Desk, to Jason the Concierge to the Bellmen. I guess when you live in paradise, why be in a bad mood, these folks were ALWAYS helpful and so so nice! Our 2 bedroom 2 bath was very spacious and well appointed, I did not mind cooking and doing laundry! We did pay for an upgrade to a higher floor which I felt was worth every penny, amazing oceanfront views of Waikiki beach and Diamond Head. Yes, the elevators were a little slow, but we were never in a hurry. The central location makes dining out very easy, with just about anything you want within a 5-10 minute walk. We had two nice dinners, one at the Seafood Village in the Hyatt complex and then at Hula Grill. My 15 yr. old son took surfing lessons near the Marriott and got up the first time, we also had a blast on a outrigger canoe ride, hiked Diamond head, enjoyed ""The Lost"" tour and spent an afternoon on the beach. The Arizona Memorial was closed for renovation and that was our only bummer!

61362514,40,Elevators a major bottleneck,"The good news is the hotel is right across the street from Waikiki beach, the less crowded side of it. The somewhat less good news is the hotel simply does not have enough elevators for the capacity, and a very confusing system whereby you swipe your key card, punch in the floor number, and wait... and wait... During busy times, often you get the ""please try again"" message over and over - frustrating!    Otherwise an OK hotel for the price.

59708742,40,Jack Lord would have stayed here for the Spectacular View.,"We booked a 2 bed Premium Ocean Front Suite as we were taking the whole family to Waikiki and wanted a central location. This option was more cost-effective than booking premium rooms in a top beachfront hotel. The suite we had booked was very nice and recently refurbished, however the very helpful staff offered us an upgrade to a topfloor penthouse suite which provided much more room for our family. Although the furnishings and decoration in the penthouse were very tired (not yet refurbished), the panoramic view from the full width balcony was so spectacular that we had to take it. We had uninterupted views beyond Diamond Head, over the city of Honolulu, the mountains, magnificent sunsets and the whole of Waikiki Beach. Believe me this view delivered the wow factor, big time.    If Jack Lord could have used our balcony for the opening shots of H 50, he would have done!    The staff were exceptionally helpful and the valet parking was very efficient. These condos are in a good central location across the main drag from the beach. The only small disappointment was the condition of the rooms (which you can overcome by asking for an updated suite). At the end of the day you will spend more time admiring the view than the furniture.    I would recommend these condos for families that want to be right in the middle of where it is all happening.",Mar 2010,February 2008,Traveled with family,,London
59681942,50,Wow!,"We stayed for 6 days and loved it. Even though it was just me and my husband, we opted for a 2 bedroom/2 bath because we like extra space. We were on the 36th floor and had a huge balcony with a breathtaking full view of the ocean and Diamond Head.    The hotel is hard to find because of the tiny entrance. It’s not on the main street that the GPS says it’s on. You actually have to turn onto Lili Uokalani and then keep your eyes open WIDE because the sign and entrance are small. In fact we passed it the first time and had to go around the block. And the valet area doesn’t have the best design. It’s small and you usually have to squeeze your car past other cars and watch out for people because it’s also the only way in and out of the hotel for people. But the valet guys were great. So nice and helpful, always with a smile on their face and a kind word. Don’t forget to tip. Valet also has beach towels you can use for free. All you have to do is cross the street and Waikiki beach is right there!    Check in was quick and the people were just as kind as the valet guys. Tomo (if I remember correctly) checked us in and then took us up to our room to show us around. What a nice guy! Our elevators were never crowded but there was a bit of a wait with being so high on the 36th floor. I talked to the concierge man several times for advice and he was very helpful. You can pretty much ask him anything.    The room itself was perfect! We had a lovely kitchen, fully stocked with pots, pans, silverware, dishes, dishwasher, frige, microwave, stove and oven. And the hotel management also left a bottle of champagne and a box of Godiva! It was so nice being able to cook my own meals in the kitchen. We ran down to the ABC store (there’s one to the right AND left of the hotel, just a few steps away) and picked up some bread and peanut butter and jelly and snacks for the room. Food is not as expensive as some people make it seem). And house keeping did an excellent job and they even wash the dishes for you! They also do a turn down service at night and give you a different dessert each time like Godiva chocolates or Hawaiian cinnamon toast. We had a washer dryer in the room and the detergent is replenished everyday, but don’t forget to bring your own dryer sheets.    Each room had a tv with over a hundred channels, the bathrooms were nicely designed, the beds were comfortable, the room always smelled clean and fresh, and it was always very quiet! We never heard noise from another room or even from other balconies! The only negative is the pool. It is on the 4th floor and in between two high rises so there’s barely any sun and is very windy. The pool is supposed to be heated but with it being in the shade, it is a chilly.    The service is impeccable and I would definitely return. The Aston doesn’t have the typical hotel feel where there’s lots of tourists crowding the lobby. It’s very intimate and quiet (people actually live there so it’s also got a comfortable, homey feel) and the staff get to know you and you feel at home.

We were blown away. The rooms are HUGE and we got a great rate even last minute. We stayed in a Junior Suite partial view but we had full view of the beach anyway which was great.    Service was even better than the room! Ed and the guys who serve as valets and bellmen were outstanding, learning our names by day 2 and going above and beyond. When we mentioned the king bed was a little firm, we returned to find it lined with memory foam! Are you kidding me?    Everyone else has already mentioned all the great things about this beautiful place, so let me just agree with all the positives. This is what Aloha is all about.

59154399,50,Our new place to stay in Waikiki,"My husband, adult son, and I stayed here in early March. I originally chose the Beach Tower due to its location (only 3 blocks from my godparents' condo in Waikiki) and the size (ability for our son to have his own room & bath). We were all extremely pleased with my choice. The location is fantastic; right across the street from the beach and in easy walking distance of all of the shopping & restaurants of Waikiki. The staff was very friendly during our entire stay. We were escorted to our suite by one of the desk staff who also showed us all of the features of each suite. We never had to wait for more than 5 minutes for the valet to bring our car. The concierge was very helpful in answering any of our questions. In a word, the service was outstanding. The suite itself was very spacious & comfortably furnished with a large lanai that was large enough for us to eat our meals from each day. The views from the lanai are unbelievable. Being on the 23rd floor, street noise was not an issue. The view was fabulous. . The room service is from the Hyatt (right up the street) and is very expensive, but with a fully equipped kitchen, who needs room service? The valet parking is FREE (for one car), which is something I have not seen elsewhere in Waikiki. I did not see a fitness center on site but that was not a concern of mine. My son, who works in the hotel industry and is something of a ""hotel snob"" was very impressed with the Beach Tower. My husband has declared that this is where we will stay in any of our future trips to Honolulu.

57631194,50,Made my first time in Hawaii so memorable,"A group of 5 of us including myself recently returned from a weeklong stay at the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower. I think we all LOVED our hotel but I will only speak on my own behalf! We stayed in a suite on the 7th floor with a full, clean, modern, furnished kitchen with a bar overlooking the lanai which was expansive itself and fit all 5 of us for breakfast.    The staff was amazing, they made us feel so welcome and greeted us with what I felt was true natural cheer, with no trace of forced instruction. The valets especially made us feel SO welcome, everytime we took out our car and it was so nice to come back to to them.    I believe this hotel is still undergoing renovation in some rooms as it was previously a resortquest and our suite was spacious, clean, modern but simple - uncluttered. It was perfect for us. The hotel offers countless perks which really made the stay so fluid and convenient for us, it's obvious someone put a lot of thought into the offers because although they aren't excessive to the point where you feel like you're paying for services you're not using, they're all so practical and logical and wonderful that the rate is inclusive of all the following perks.    Free beach/pool towel (unlimted) on loan, free beach mats on loan, free body boards left by other guests by the honor system, free wifi, FREE and FAST valet (tip them well, they deserve it!) and a friendly and flexible housekeeping staff. I loved this hotel and although it isn't The Four Seasons, I would gladly and enthusiastically stay here again because of the location. It's right on the beach (There is now a smaller hotel located in front of it which sort of impedes the view, but its still beautiful) in the center of everything, not noisy, and lots of inexpensive fast food options available around you. The beach is beautiful, and we were able to see whales from the shore and our lanai. There is a beautiful sidewalk/running path in front of the beach and its just so refreshing and scenic because on your right you have the ocean and on your left you have a park and diamondhead. There is also a small clean pool and a HUGE deck to lay out on, along with a hot tub that has a partial view of the ocean which is so, so wonderful after a long day at the beach/outdoors.

57350464,50,We Keep Coming Back for More,"This was the third time I have stayed at this hotel. The reason we keep coming back? The location, the huge rooms and the very friendly and helpful staff members. It is right across the street from Waikiki Beach and you can walk up and down Kalakaua Avenue to shop or people watch. The rooms are bigger than most apartments in New York City and the ones we’ve stayed in have wonderful lanais.  While our stay is usually uneventful, we were very high maintenance this time. During the course of an 11 day stay we called the front desk because: we broke the in room safe, left items in our car twice, couldn’t work the DVD player, needed assistance in hiding a surprise birthday cake, we needed more coffee, wanted more detergent, couldn’t work the air conditioning and had accidentally shaken out half of Waikiki Beach from a towel in one of our bathrooms and needed to clean it up. Our needs were always attended to quickly and with a smile. I cannot say enough about the valets and their service. They began to know our schedule and usually started off to get our car even before we asked.  We are planning another trip back to Hawaii later this year and fully intend on staying here again.

This city gets a bad rap the way other tourist destinations like Orlando and Anaheim do, but the fact is, there is a lot of charm in Honolulu, and the suites, staff, location and amenities at Aston helped us feel right at home.

54638713,50,I will never stay anywhere else when I am in Hawaii,"We have relatives in Hawaii and have visited many times. We always stay in some hotel near Waikiki. The Beach Tower is by far the best hotel we have stayed in so far! The hotel staff was better than any other hotel I have EVER stayed at. Eddy, Tomo and Brian were all excellent at their jobs and Beta, our cleaning lady was top notch. We have stayed in a condo-type hotel before and sometimes you don't see the staff, except behind the front desk. Everyone working at this hotel was over-the-top nice and extremely helpful. It totally made the stay memorable.    Now, about the room...all I can say is WOW! We stayed in room #1704 partial ocean view. The only thing we couldn't see is Diamond Head. No biggie. Seen it before. In this hotel you have views on three sides of the hotel. Yep. We could look all the way up the beach and up the mountain. The rooms are very spacious and amazingly clean. We had a full kitchen with granite countertops and new refrigerator, range, microwave and a dishwasher. We had a washer and dryer in the unit as well. They supply you with laundry detergent so you can wash clothes as much as you want while you are there. The TV has like 200 channels and a DVD player which is great if you have little ones like we did. We even checked out games from the front desk (Chutes and Ladders). The room is not noisy at all. The only complaint I can even think of is that the air conditioning in the bedroom was too cold, but a quick call to maintenance and it was fixed. Housekeeping comes by 2x per day. Once to clean and once to turn down your bed at night and give you a chocolate on your pillow. So nice.    There is a ramp to self park in, but they recommend the valet service. Parking was included in our package, but you should give the attendant a tip. The longest we ever had to wait was like 60 seconds. They are wicked fast! Totally worth it. We found out that as long as you are staying at the hotel, you can have one other person park in the ramp for free. We found out too late, but this would have been great for my Auntie when she came down to visit. Next time, we will know.    From the hotel room to the beach, you can literally be there in 3 minutes. Never had to wait long for an elevator...ever. You can even check out towels from the valet on your way to the beach. One night we wanted to walk down Kalakaua Ave to do some shopping and my sister-in-law asked on a whim if they had a stroller for my 2 year old. They DID! Eddy hooked us up and away we went.    There were five of us total on a 7-day stay - me, my husband, my sister-in-law and two young children 5 and 2 years of age. There was more than enough room for the five of us and we found accommodations perfect! See you next year!",Jan 2010,January 2010,Traveled with family,,"Minnetonka, Minnesota"

I was in charge of finding accomodations that would sleep seven adults and four children. After careful consideration we rented two condos at the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower. The rooms were fabulous and spacious. By having seperate bedrooms, living areas, and a kitchen in each unit we were able to come and go without disturbing family members that wanted to sleep in, take naps, or watch television. The staff was extremely helpful and the maid service, twice daily, was awesome. We rented two vehicles and had free valet parking. The washer/dryer in the condo was a huge, huge plus. By having a kitchen in the unit, we were able to cut cost by making breakfast and lunch at home. The views of the ocean were beyond words and we had great seats for the fireworks on New Years Eve. The beach is directly across the street and we felt very comfortable allowing our twelve and fourteen year old to walk by themselves. We could watch them from our lanai.    Overall, we had a super vacation and I would highly recommend the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower to anyone......especially if you are traveling with a group!",Jan 2010,December 2009,Traveled with family,,"Billings, MT"
54437361,50,This has become my new favorite place to stay in Waikiki!,"Havem always only ever stayed at the sister property next door (11 times) and have loved it! Staff, everything about it - loved it. This trip we decided to upgrade - mainly because I found the Beach Tower in the Entertainment Book for 1/2 off the rack rate. This was a really special trip and most likely the last one with my elder sisters (both in their mid to late 70's) so wanted a really comfortable place to stay. We truly enjoyed the reception we got with drive in valet parking. We were greeted with a truly friendly ALOHA, informe3d that we only needed to check in and go to our room and our luggage would be delivered to us. Nice! Unloaded and brought to us. A first for all of us!! The ""porter"" which is much less than he was delivered our luggage with a smile, put each piece in the right room, explained things about operation of things in the unit and left us. Having the kitchen was so nice. We made breakfast and sat on the lanai each morning to enjoy it along with the incredible view. It was so nice to just hand off the keys when we got back from our sightseeing excursions and go to our room, relax and have a nice cool drink, and again look at that beautiful water and those swaying palms. We never used the pool or other facilities. Never really had the time and who needed a pool with the beautiful Kuhio Beach Park right across the street?  The staff was wonderful to us. I had the hideabed and it was very sagging but when I mentioned this to housekeeping I had a big thick featherbed delivered within 10 minutes. Our beds were turned down each night, comforters taken off and folded away and candy on the pillow. Immaculate is how I would describe our refurbished unit.  I had really great emails with Mr. Ragan, and told him about our special trip and requested a certain type room, and requested which floors we would like and really hoped for a refurbished room. We got all three!  I just cvan't say enough good things about this place.    My only negative comments would be these:  When they refurbished, they had a huge area that they put in cabinets and a place for the LCD big flat screen tv and components. They would have been just fine in the Entertainment unit that was still in the room and it would have been a great investment to have put in a murphey bed (plenty of room for it) instead of having guests sleep in a hide a bed. They also should have brought in brand new beds as a guest should never have to endure sleeping in a sagging one. For the rack rate of this place, it is almost shameful to have that situation.  But that is my only complaint. Would I stay here again? Even if I had to sleep on the hideabed? In a heartb eat!!!!",Jan 2010,October 2008,Traveled with family,,NW Washington state

53851653,50,Great Experience,"We have vacationed in Waikiki for 25 years and stayed at various hotels in town. For us the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower is the place we will call home while in Honolulu. With two girls ages 23 and 19 my wife and I wanted a family vacation that was together, not in two separate hotel rooms, we got that and much more at the Beach Tower. Our condo was 1,263 square feet, including the lanai, two bedroom two baths, full kitchen, washer and dryer and very large living and dining room, one trip to Costco and your set for the week.    The Hotel is directly across the street from Waikiki Beach a short walk to all the shops and restaurants Waikiki has to offer. We rented a car and The Beach Tower provides FREE parking and Valet service. You will not find a more helpful, pleasant or friendly staff than the Valets. On our departure they arranged transportation for us to the airport and had a stretch limo waiting for us at the same cost we would have paid a taxi.    The pool area is a relaxing way to sun without having to get sandy. There are tables, chairs and lounges in areas of sun and shade, a great place to sit and read, play cards or just relax with a view of the ocean. The pool and Jacuzzi is large enough for the 140 rooms in the hotel. The pool area also has a sauna in the men’s and women’s locker rooms.    The hotel offers FREE high speed internet service, I brought a wireless router so we could all use the internet from anywhere in the room or patio. We enjoyed the availability of the internet without having to share one fixed connection.    The living room windows wrap around the room with a spectacular view of the ocean. The lanai was huge with seating for four, direct views of the ocean and a pass-through window to the kitchen to make it easy to get food and drinks. The higher the floor the less street noise and better view you’ll have of the ocean, sunrises and sunsets. The cable television has as many channels as I have at home; it was nice to be able to watch the Lakers play.    Management and staff are extremely customer experience oriented and exceptionally personable. In my opinion The Beach Tower is a must stay if space and location are important. I have included some pictures and a layout of the rooms to help you get a better idea of the property. Hope this helps.",Jan 2010,January 2010,Traveled with family,,"San Dimas, California"
53249636,50,Excellent choice,"Family of 4 with 2 additional teenage boys. The best location around for a group the size we had. We arrived very early, and as our room not ready (as expected) we were offered an upgrade to the presidential suite (4002) for an additional charge. It did mean we could enter now. We took up the offer at it was 7am...and we did not wish to wait till 3pm. Views and location were amazing. Being the presidential suite however, did not mean it was any larger or more suitable for the President, but rather on the top floor. I will compliment the hotel and its staff to the hilt, however, I did expect more by way of fixtures and fittings for a room described in that manner. I understand that the suites are individually owned and therefore decorated slightly differently, but one would hope to have reasonable sized televisions in both the living and master bedroom and a bath that did not spit out black grit when the spa mode was enabled. (i did alert the night clerk to this) Maybe the management could discuss this with the vendor as our 10 nights rates could easily cover the cost of the updates required. Having said that, I would definitely go back again as the staff at the valet and security were awesome, and so friendly and knowledgeable. I did not have much need for the concierge, but they were always friendly and said hello! My son cut his head quite badly whilst there (his own fault) and the management were brilliant in assisting me in getting care and treatment. All things done, a great time was had by us all, and as said, would go back again.",Jan 2010,January 2010,Traveled with family,,"Sydney, Australia"
52115943,50,Really great stay especially with 2 young kids.,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Waikiki Beach Tower. Great and friendly staff, big spacious suites (we had 2 bedrooms 2 baths), free valet parking. Amenities are little dated, but still useable. We had a ocean view room and the view was spectacular. The lanai was huge and the furniture, while not fancy, was more than suitable.    The pool area is underrated. Yes, the pool is small, but its clean, the water is comfortable (not cold) and its not crowded. Our kids really enjoyed the pool and the hot tub.    The location was perfect. East side of Waikiki and walking distance to everything. Kuhio Beach is right across the street and its a wonderful beach for young children. The Beach Tower provides new towels everyday for beach goers and also a bucket and shovels for the young kids to play in the sand.    In our opinion the only downside to this hotel is that when you are on a higher floors the air conditioning units on the other buildings are quite loud. So don't expect to sleep with the lanai open and just listen to the waves crash along the beach.    We expect to stay here again on our next trip to Oahu.",Dec 2009,December 2009,Traveled with family,,"Portland, Oregon"
51795829,40,Not bad at all,"I went for a 2 week trip with the missus. Waikiki beach is a surprise - 4 lanes of traffic running parallel to thje beach so very built up and busy.  Hotel was fine. We looked at other hotels on the beach, Outrigger etc, and they are not worth the extra money. The beach is so crowded in front of thos hotels that people were practically lying on each other.  We had a one bedroom suite for two weeks and it was perfectly adequate. Balconies are a bit small - not enough room for 2 chairs. Location is great. Pool is ok. Bar downstairs is quite noisy but fun and handy for a bite to eat. It's a comfortable reasonably priced base so you can spend money on other things like;  Hiring a Harley  Take a surf lesson  Have a helicopter tour  Go in a shark cage  Go in a submarine  Visit other islands  Shoot 44 magnums  Shop  Snorkelling is excellent  All of which make Oahu fairly memorable.",Dec 2009,August 2009,Traveled as a couple,,London
51669716,50,Perfect location for families with young kids. Beach and Zoo closeby,"Rented a unit for 2 weeks with my family.  Loved: Location, Views, Huge lanai and ample space, Nicely furnished with tons of shelves to store items away from kids' reach. Having a mostly fully functioning kitchen  Drawbacks: Kitchen and Bath a bit dated (shower doors stick in master bath), Electric burners on range, We were told to ask the bellmen for tips and advice since the concierge was for hotel guests only (we used the expedia desk at the hyatt next door for booking trips), Pool is mostly in shadow and a bit chilly and no poolside services. Not a lively scene like the hyatt next door.  If traveling with little ones, plan to bring your own crib and high chair seat. Our travel high chair fit great. It would have been the perfect family hangout for my 1.5 and 3.5 yr olds if they had a cabinet lock under the sink where all the plastic bags and cleaners are stored.

51176804,40,"Terrific Location, Breathtaking View & Great Value","The location of this hotel is definately one of its main selling points - it is right accross the road from Waikiki beach! It is about a 5 minute walk to the international marketplace & the main action of Waikiki, but again this is a good thing as you are in a slightly more peaceful region of Waikiki but are close enough to everything. It was quiet at night on the streets around the hotel generally.  We stayed in an ocean front room on level 18, the view took our breath away! It was amazing. The room is nicely decorated in a true hawaiian fashion which some may see as tacky but we loved it as it always reminded you where you were!  The pool area may not look like anything spectacular - but who needs it when you are staying on waikiki beach? The pool itself was the perfect temperature and never busy, the pool chairs were really comfortable and some were doubles meaning there was a table connecting two chairs with a canopy to get the sun off your face. The pool area was filled with sun in the afternoon which ment it was great to return from tours etc and be able to relax in the warm sun.  Breakfast on the beach was another great aspect of this hotel - it allowed you to get a little extra for snacks during the day, and also if (like us) you had tours that began early such as 6am, you could take some yoghurts etc and keep them in your fridge in your room to eat before you left. They also had relaxing live music each morning. One downside is that brekkie was only 6.30-8.30 which didnt allow for a sleep in!  Beach towels are provided, as are beach chairs if you wish to take them accross to the beach. There are 3 concierge desks which were all helpful and made organising last minute activities easy.  There is a wolf gang pucks express downstairs which had yummy pizzas for under $10 which was great for a quick & cheap meal.  Tiki's bar and grill was great also, it had live music every night and great service & food, tuesday nights were taco night where they had $2 tacos which were delicious, along with this they had numerous drink specials & happy hours. It looked right onto the beach so was a great place to unwind each day.  All in all, we loved our time at Aston Waikiki Beach and would stay here next time we travel to Hawaii.",Dec 2009,December 2009,Traveled with family,,Sydney
50639962,50,Breath taking views and above and beyond service!,"This was our 3rd time to stay on Waikiki and we never once, not even the slightest bit wanted to try another hotel or resort. On this vacation to the Beach Tower we stayed 9 nights which included Thanksgiving.The beach tower is in an ideal spot because you are right across from the open beach, no resort in front of you. The beach out in front of the hotel is perfect for anyone because it's right at a spot on waikiki where there is a enclosed ""pool"" so worries of sea creatures nibbling on your toes are gone and this also makes up for the Beach Towers lack-luster pool on level 4. I have to say though, the best selling point I can give about this hotel is their staff. From the moment we checked in, the receptionist welcomed us back and upgraded us to a full ocean-front view on the 21st floor. It was nice to be acknowledge for our loyalty to the Beach Tower and the view was breath taking, literally. We had view of diamond head, and every morning when the sun comes over the mountain it looks like a postcard! Every morning we would make our coffee and cereal and eat breakfast while we watched the early morning surfers catch waves. It's also not a very high-traffic hotel so service is one-on-one. Everyday passing by the front desk we would get an ""Aloha, what are your plans for today?"" and they were excited to hear our very touristy plans, but always had a bit of advice that came in handy. It was also nice that the distance from the entrance to the rooms was not a mile walk. That really comes in handy when you look like crap from being at the beach all day or have had a little too much to drink at night, you dont have to face many people on your way through the hotel haha. Anytime we called down to the front desk they were more than HAPPY to accomodate any of our requests, which ranged from a lesson on how to cook rice in the rice cooker, to the fact that I accidently threw away a Macy's coupon for Black Friday. When I called down to see if there was any chance a day-old paper was laying around the receptionist said no but that she thought there might be one in the trash, I tried stopping her from digging in the trash but she insisted and found an extra paper and did so with a smile.. all for a coupon! After every request, we soon got a phone call in the room 10 minutes later from the front desk ensuring that our request was fufilled and if there was anything they could do. Another perk about this hotel is the twice daily maid service. We always looked forward to the turn down service every evening, because they would leave us a different goody. I also have to say, it's rare to find a resort or hotel with free parking but it's more rare to have a group of valet's/bellhops who LOVE their job. They remember all their guests by name, which is probably because they engage with every single family. We were excited to pull into the hotel drive after each days agenda because we couldn't wait to tell the valet that we swam with sharks, went ATV'ing, or anything else we did. The guys truly care, they would get excited for us and gave lots of advice and were great with directions.    I can go on and on, but the Beach Tower made our trip 10x better. We were able to put more money towards excursion's and tours because we could buy our own groceries to keep from eating out each night. If you want a suite-like room, with views of Waikiki and Diamond Head, exceptionnal service, and the ability to save money on food expenses choose the Beach Tower.

The last 6 months had been really difficult for my sisters (one work related .. one health wise). My brother, who had cared for his sick wife the 20 years they were married before her passing hadn't been on a vacation in probably 25 years. I was so focused on wanting this to be a healing, enjoyable trip for them, I didn't realize until I was back in paradise just how much I NEEDED the vacation also. I guess trying to be the rock for everyone else took more of a toll on me than I realized.    Anyway, back to the review ... we arrived on October 19th and would have been on the 5th floor. We upgraded to the 17th floor and absolutely loved our room!!! This was the 3rd Aston/Resort Quest property we had stayed at and may I just say, we won't stay anywhere else but the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower when we come back. Every single person we encountered that worked there showered us with the Aloha spirit. If we had any questions, my brother would run down to have Karin at the front desk answer them and she always did so with a smile on her face. The valets are ""da bomb"". Ed rocked and we loved Russ and Brian (the security guard). They truly made our week there extra special. Being able to valet the car (free .. even better), was helpful since we had our 74 year old mother with us. The guys were extremely gracious each time they helped her get into or out of the van.    Normally, when you are staying in a condo, there is not any ""service"" to the rooms. Not only did housekeeping come once a day, they came twice. We were really surprised when we returned one morning after going out walking / shopping and the breakfast dishes we had left to wash up were already cleaned up. Now, how many times will you see that somewhere else??    Our unit was very spacious and I loved our lanai. I spent more than a few hours out there over the week just looking at the water and/or reading. Believe me, we were extremely sad when we had to leave :(    I have absolutely nothing negative to say about our experience at the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower.

The view of Waikiki beach was amazing (15th floor) and the beach is literally right out the front door of the hotel. The staff went way above and beyond to be helpful. They have free (wired) internet, but when I asked at the front desk about connecting two laptops at the same time, they said we could connect in the lobby or the 4th floor pool area to a wireless signal, and then they brought up a router so we could both connect from our room! They brought us fresh laundry detergent each day and loaded up the dishwasher when they cleaned the room each day. They have free valet parking and they carried up our groceries for us! My kids loved the staff and the free beach toys on check-in. We also used the ""kids play free"" coupons to get some free activities on the island.

The kitchen did have all dishes, pots, pans, etc so we could stock the full-sized fridge for a week's worth of food! The staff were very friendly, especially the valet staff (who loved driving our corvette!). The only problems I had was the fact that we stayed in a 2br 2bath deluxe unit on the 22nd floor, since we only paid for the 1br 1bath, they locked the doors to the available extra bedroom and bathroom. Now we were promised (by email from their manager) a free upgrade for our 20th wedding anniversayr, because of an AARP Expedia special, you think they would have just OPENED THE DOOR? No, we need to separate rooms due to snoring, and one of us had to sleep on the sleeper couch. I don't get it! They had ""availabililty"" so this made no sense at all. Also, with the Aston Circle hotel just below us, they had something on the roof that made a loud banging noise for the first 5 days and nights of our trip. Yes, someone finally fixed it, and it was quiet, but we could not fully enjoy our lanai because of the agravating noise!

The only downside was that 2 nights were not long enough to appreciate either the space or Honolulu itself...next time!  Some points:  - check in was amazing - drive up, handover the car, 5 minutes at reception and we were good to go  - our room on the 24th floor had lovely panaramic views, however if you went a couple of floors lower your view would be obscured by the Circle Hotel and would not IMHO be panaramic (front on only) despite being advertised as such - so something to watch out for if that matters to you  - our room was spotless (including the all important bathrooms), very well equipped and the bed so comfy I slept like a log - and I can be very unsettled outside my own bed. They are more than comfortable but I would not describe them as ""trendy"" or out of this world luxurious - so maybe not for the young hip honeymooners  - could not fault service  - internet is free which is great - but it is not wireless or high speed which could be frustrating if you need to get some work done while on vacation... but then again a great excuse not to work and to enjoy yourself!  - great location - a pedestrian crossing right outside for the beach, the only thing better would be being on the beach itself  - inside the unit with the doors closed it was so peaceful. The unit's airconditioner was unobtrusive and a very comfy temp  - on the balcony there was a bit of noise from the aircon compressors on the roof of the hotel next door  - the kitchen is great, not that we cooked up a storm but you could if you wanted to. Washer and dryer also very handy.  - we didn't go to the pool or use room service so can't comment",Oct 2009,October 2009,Traveled with family,,"Perth, Australia"
47139044,40,Terrific choice,"I'll let you read about the rooms on the other reviews. They are all accurate. These are basically apartments. We had the large, 2-bedroom variety. Everything was outstanding, particularly the location and the service (the valet guys were super - they remembered my son's name and welcomed him by name every day when we came back from the beach). We loved the location, the view from the room, the balcony, the close walking distance to shopping and nicer restaurants. The ubiquitous ABC stores carried everything we needed for quick breakfasts we prepared in our kitchen. Really, my only negative is that the pool area is pretty lame (clean, adequate, but not in an attractive location). If you want a top-notch location and something better than the standard hotel room space, you really can't do better than this place.    Also, it seems that the most popular review on here complains about the lack of high speed Internet. We had no problems. It's not wireless (you have to use an Ethernet cord on the desk). Not sure if this is a new thing, but it's there, don't worry.",Oct 2009,October 2009,Traveled with family,,"Denver, CO"

46302416,50,Family Friendly Perfection in Paradise,"The Aston Waikiki Beach Tower was the perfect hotel for our family vacation to Oahu. Our group of 7 (3 kids, 2 parents, 2 grandparents) fit comfortably in our suite. I checked pricing at all the major hotels on Waikiki Beach, and this hotel was the best value to accomodate our entire group. All the positive reviewes and ratings on Trip Advisor made it even easier to book.    We were greeted with awesome valets/bell captains. They were happy to help us with piles of luggage, groceries and shopping bags that we collected throughout the week. The front desk staff upgraded us from the partial ocean view that I booked to a penthouse suite on the 39th floor. It seemed like you could see the curvature of the earth because the view of the ocean went on forever from the balcony.    The suite was well furnished, and the beds were comfortable enough for sleeping. We used the room as a home base but really spent very little time there when we weren't asleep. We shopped at Costco the first day of our trip and used the kitched to save time and money on lunches and snacks. The in room laundy was an added plus. Based on the price for this hotel, my expectations for the room weren't all that high. The suite was very comfortable with an AC that blew very cold (even with the balcony doors wide open most of the time!!).    The hotel provided each child a beach toy set with bucket and shovel, and we made good use of them in building sand castles. The beach is literally across the street from the hotel, so it could not be any easier to maximize time spent there. When we weren't at the beach, we visited the Dole plantation, Matsumoto Shave Ice, the Polynesian Cultural Center, and Pearl Harbor. Our hotel was the perfect staging area for each new adventure.    If you take kids to Waikiki Beach, stay at this hotel. You won't regret it.",Oct 2009,October 2009,Traveled with family,,"Sandy, Utah"
46233730,40,"Elevator From Hell, But Nice View","Ok, maybe a crazy elevator won't deter many of you from picking a hotel, but my wife and I would think twice about going back. Let me give you our circumstance: we were traveling with a 13 month old, 2 bags, a car seat, and stroller (but we had 2 grandmommies to help). Not easy, anywhere you go, but here it was extra hard. Every time you need to use the elevator you had to take out your card, scan it on this machine against the wall and press your floor. This action would allow you to be taken directly to your floor without those annoying stops. Sound cool huh? Yeah, that's what I though at first too. Now put into place the fact that the place was packed, and you were carrying around your beach gear, bag, sand mat, stroller and other stuff, and last thing you want is to find your stupid card to scan it. Man this got really old really quick.  Add to this, the fact that the lobby is on the second floor, and to get to it you had to take either an escalator or a dedicated little elevator. So imagine lugging around your stuff and baby through 2 elevators just to get to your floor. Yeah, it's a little picky, but when you travel with your kid, you want things to be easy for you. And waiting for an elevator for 15 minutes is not cool, especially with a little one (this happened only once, but on average it seemed like we waited for an elevator at least 5 minutes every time)  So now for the good stuff. The location of the hotel is really good. Next to the Honolulu Zoo and Aquarium. Across the street you'll find a nice swimming area that has a wave breaking wall so that the waves are non-existant. Good for kids, but maybe not so cool for adults. The hotel has several eateries attached (at the street level, bottom floor). They include, Wolkgang Puck Express (tried it, was good, open late), Subway, Coldstone Icecream, and a Cookie Place. Lobby floor has a corner bar/grill place called Tiki's (didn't try it, but could hear the loud music the first night we were there).  As for ""Breakfast On the Beach"", it was very convenient, but it's not on the beach- to get to the beach you need to cross the street. I guess it sounds better than ""Breakfast at the Pool"". It filled us up for 4 out of the 5 days were there. Most folks do go down for breakfast, so prepare to wait in line on some days. It is kinda early too, 6am-8am. The one really annoying thing about breakfast is that it is by the pool, so all they have are a few tables and lots of those long beach lounging chairs, which doesn't make it easy to have breakfast. They provide a little tiny cooler to hold all your food. You can pack it with as much stuff as you want and just take it with you. So you don't have to eat there. We did, but we had to wait sometimes for a table. The main hot item changes daily: egg/ham english muffin sandwich, egg burrito/wrap, and scrambled egg with bacon and tater tots. The rest remains the same: yogurt, cereal, assorted pastries, bagels, french toast sticks, pre-cut/ pre-packed fruit, coffee, tea, fountain drinks. Quality was not bad, but definitely not restaurant grade. That's why by the 5th day we treated ourselves to a nice breakfast.  Now I give this hotel a 4 star based on value (5 nights 4 people, 2 rooms $3000 with air), location and overall convenience. I couldn't imagine finding and paying for breakfast every morning with a baby. The service, the rooms and amenities were all average but definitely not poor. As far as the elevator, it would not deter me if I was traveling only as a couple. They also posted that they were trying to update the system- don't know how though. Last, the view from our room was very nice, looking at the beach from the balcony and from the front door looking at diamond peak park.  It was my first time in Honolulu and it was very nice overall. Hope this helps",Oct 2009,October 2009,Traveled on business,,Sacramento
46055704,30,This is just a 3 star hotel. Don't expect too much.,"We stayed there for 5 nights. The staffs were as nice and polite as those in other hotels. However, the suite we stayed in was in diamond head side. It was so noisy from the engines probably for the air conditioning of the building. There was no way to relax and enjoy the spectacular view on the balcony. We had to talk loud in order to hear each other. We could not open the slider doors because of the noise.  The suite we stayed in was spacious. That gave us plenty of room inside. However, most facilities of the rooms looked quite old except for the granite countertops. The beds were the worst part. The mattresses were very uncomfortable.  From my point of view, this hotel is just a 3 star hotel. From the stand point of a 3 star hotel, it has done an excellent job.

45599025,50,Like staying with friends,"I was trying to decide between staying here and another property down the street. I finally decided to book here based on the fact that management responded to almost every review on Trip Advisor and I got the feeling even before I met the staff that they cared about whether their guests had an enjoyable experience. Once we arrived, that was certainly true! From the check in desk, to the cleaning staff, to the valets (especially the valets!) everyone was super friendly and took time to remember our names, our habits, and what we liked. The property itself was great. It was so nice to be able to do laundry after a sandy day at the beach and to have the option to cook meals in a well stocked kitchen. They even provide laundry soap and dish soap. The location is great for walking to local shopping and restaurants. We had absolutely no complaints about our stay! And even though I prefer to spend time away from Waikiki, I will definitely stay here again and use it as my ""home base"" in Hawaii.",Oct 2009,September 2009,Traveled with family,,"Los Angeles, California"

42738557,50,"Outstanding, best vacation we ever had...","Aloha!    I have taken too long to write my review, I apologize. My brother, sister-in-law, niece, husband and I stayed at the Waikiki Beach Tower in September 2008. I am a travel agent and have stayed at many properties in Honolulu and the Beach Tower by far is the best I have stayed at thus far. I think I will just continue to stay there, no use in being disappointed somewhere else.    The condo was very nicely furnished and comfortable. The kitchen had everything we needed, just add food and drink! The washer and dryer in the unit is a very nice feature. The staff was helpful, friendly and went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable. The bell staff will be happy to point out good restaurants or out of the way places to visit.    We were only supposed to stay at the Beach Tower for three days, until my brother's ""timeshare"" became available. Unfortunately (actually fortunately for us) the ""timeshare's"" air conditioning was out and we had to scramble to see if we could stay for another seven days at the Beach Tower. The staff was very helpful, and although we couldn't stay in the same unit, the staff gave us a choice between another newly renovated unit or the penthouse which had not been as recently renovated. We picked the penthouse, as the view from the lanai was absolutely breathtaking. We packed our luggage and the bell staff moved everything to the new unit while we went to the beach. The views from our lanai of Waikiki Beach, Diamond Head and the sunrises and sunsets were awesome.    The property is in a great location, across the street from the beach with lots of restaurants and shopping nearby.    We still talk about what a glorious vacation we had and how we were lucky that the air conditioning was out at the ""timeshare"" we were supposed to have moved to. Every morning we all went out to our lanai, had our coffee and watched the early morning surfers and the beautiful sunrises. And then in the evening the sunsets were just as beautiful.    I would not give one moments hesitation about recommending this property to family, friends or clients!!!    Mahalo  Lori",Sep 2009,September 2008,Traveled with family,,arizona
40626625,40,Great.,"I was a bit disappointed when we first checked in-the smell of Shake and Vac carpet cleaner, the institutional color painted on the walls, and generic furniture was a bit off putting at first.

40202821,40,View and much more,"The room is huge - bigger then most apartments. It has a full kitchen, washer & dryer, and a huge balony with a view to die for. For us the best part is that there are only two rooms per floor. Ours happened to be on an end, and we never heard anybody except when they were right in front of the living room. The location is at the quiet (if there is such a thing) end of Waikiki. The staff was incredibly nice, probably as consistently nice as anywhere you would go, even the Four Seasons.    The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is the bed was somewhat uncomfortable, the TV's were tiny and the towels were pretty flimsy. This seems really petty, but it does not miss 5 stars by much.    One suggestion - get directions the first time you go. We went to the wrong hotel the first time; after that is was a piece of cake.

37304323,20,Overrated!,"The Aston Beach Tower on Oahu was the worst place we have stayed in Hawaii. Our room had a noxious odor coming from the master bathroom when we checked in. We complained to the front desk immediately. They sent housekeeping up to try to mask the odor. They were able to make it not as noticeable for a brief period of time. It was not so bad that we requested a different room, because we had a good view and were afraid we would get a worse view. The odor was worse at times and better at times but never went away. On the day before departure, we went to Concierge to arrange our pickup for the airport the following day. The person there asked how our stay was. I told them about the odor, and they immediately reported this to the front desk (again). Shortly thereafter a maintenance person reported to the room. Immediately he said he knew the source of the problem. He asked if we would leave the room for a while, and we told him we were about to leave. He asked us to let the front desk know when we left because he was going to pour some strong chemicals into the bathtub drain to clear the problem and we should be out of the room for a while. He said it was a common problem in the building. We left and notified the front desk on our way out. We were gone for 2-3 hours and returned to the same smell in our unit. About 2 hours after we returned, the maintenance person knocked on our door. He asked if we ever left. We said yes and that we notified the front desk as we were leaving. He said they never told him. We told him to do his thing unless it would be harmful to us. He did his thing, and we did not notice the noxious odor for as long as we were there.    Additionally, the common areas in that ‘hotel’ were dingy; there was a musky odor in all common areas; the common areas were dark (as was our unit); it was not an ‘inviting’ place. I would recommend to any of my friends that they avoid that place, even though it’s location was good (not great). We were on an eighth-floor unit and overlooked Waikiki Beach Park (sorta-if you looked around the round hotel immediately in front of us.) I think the reviews of this place are inflated.

This was our first trip to Hawaii and I spent hours reading thru reviews of so many hotels... Although I could have just as easily gotten two rooms for the same or less cost at one of the other many beach hotels, in the end deciding factor was having all of us in the same room as these family vacations become more and more infrequent (19 year old son gone to college, 17 year old on his way too). It was a great decision which shock among shockers even the boys agreed with. Had a partial view room which was partial in two different directions so in my estimation was a complete view, both bedrooms were in the back of the unit so we were shielded from the street noise which really wasn't bad anyway. Cooked breakfast each morning, drinks on the lanai each afternoon/evening after a few games of billiards (wife wiped us all out). Did laundry day before departure so not much to do now at home. Each night the boys went out on their own and returned by 1:00AM which seemed fine as I could seel families with small children still walking the beach/streets at that time.

The advantage of a condo when traveling with 3 offspring cannot be underestimated: the amount of space, option to eat some meals in (which we did for most breakfast/lunch meals), ability to use washer/dryer, spectacular views from our lanai, all enhanced the comfort and enjoyment of our stay.  This unit was located high enough to have great views above the smaller building in front of it. The lanai was large enough to accomodate all of us at the table, had great morning views of the surf schools heading out to the waves in the early morning. Having high-speed internet access in the room was great. Kitchen was modern and clean. We enjoyed easy access to the beach across the street. This location was ideal for us: close to everything in Waikiki- we walked to Duke's for dinner one night, and drinks at House Without a Key at Halekulani. The Zoo and Aquarium are all within walking distance. The free parking space included in the rental was a plus- parking in the city can be scarce and expensive. The concierge desk and bell hops were very friendly and helpful.

The staff was wonderful, and quick to help with any requests whether it was information about restaurants or where to work out.( The Pacific Beach Hotel just across the street lets Aston Waikiki Beach Tower guests in to use their very nice fitness center for $10/day).    We didn't really miss not staying at a hotel, and were thrilled not to spend so much money on hotel breakfasts or chairs at the beach ( The Aston provides sand chairs for free.) There are two (that we counted!) ABC stores within a few blocks of the Aston, so you can always pick up stuff for breakfast or snacks, anyway.

My husband and I took our 4 kids from 17 to 7 to Oahu after not visiting for 17 years. We loved the Beach Tower - it was great to have a kitchen and washer and dryer. We were able to eat breakfast (coffee provided) in the room and make a quick walk across the street to the beach. Beach towels and mats were always provided at the bell desk and all the employees were super friendly. We lived on Oahu for a few years but this time we wanted our kids to experience the activities of Waikiki and they loved them. The beach near the hotel is great and there are so many beautiful hotels, bars, restaurants, and shops so close. We walked all over Waikiki from there in addition to going diving with sharks, several trips to Pearl Harbor and Hickam, hiking Diamond Head, farmers markets, Lanikai and Kailua, visiting friends in Mililani, Iolani Palace, Ala Moana, canoe riding, snorkeling, and finding numerous places for mochi and shave ice! They were doing construction on a few days of our stay (ripping out tile on lanais) and provided free trolley tickets to Ala Moana. We had activities already planned on those days so it wasn't a problem. Maid service was there twice a day and in the evening would bring candy, rice treat, or cinnamon toast for us all. The kids loved that. I'd highly recommend the Beach Tower for people with families and who want a washer/dryer and kitchen. My kids loved the pool because not many people were in it (and the hot tub) and would go there after the beach on several days.

The staff here is amazing! They are very friendly and will offer great tips on places to see and where to dine. The vallet guys are the best!

But with the economic downturn hotels seemed to be BEGGING for people to come and stay with them. The great price we obtained off the hotel web site was amazing. Less than half the rack rate and less then I would have spent on a lower quality hotel a few years back.    At check-in we were scheduled for a room on the 7th floor. The hotel offered an upgrade. We eventually negotiated a real cheap upgrade rate to get to the 33rd floor. (Yeah... I am sure they do this a lot, but hey.... it was worth it to me.) What a view from up there. And it was so quiet. We left the doors open at night to enjoy the ocean sounds and the cool breeze.    The room:  Room was huge. Mainly because it was a 2 bedroom unit that they locked off one room of since we did not need it. Full and well supplied kitchen. Modern appliances and lots of space. Living room was nicely furnished. Bed was a little soft for my liking, but I like a very hard matress. Bathroom and sink are was nice. Having a washer and dryer was great. We knew we had that so we packed a lot less clothing. Free high speed internet was nice also.    The location:    Loved it. Right across from the tidepool areas on Waikiki beach. Close to the malls and food and within walking distance of the zoo and aquarium. There is also a street 2 block south that was a quick way to get to H1. (It runs right by the zoo.)

The bed was one of the most comfortable beds in which I’ve ever slept while staying in a hotel, and I plan to go online to find where I can buy a feather pillow like the ones at the resort! Those were the epitome of comfort, and every night I experienced a peaceful night’s sleep. There were tvs in the living room and both bedrooms (although who watches TV in Hawaii anyway?) :-) The 2nd bedroom had 2 twin sized beds and not much of a view. The kitchen was stocked with dishes from plates to silverware to cookware. There was a dishwasher, a blender, a full-sized refrigerator, toaster, coffee maker with coffee, sugar packets, and cream provided (and even hot tea!). In Hawaii, Kona coffee is a must-buy. If you do buy your own coffee for the room, you need to buy coffee filters, as those are not provided unless you use the one-pot coffee packets provided at the hotel.  The hotel provides a box of Tide detergent each day, though they will give you more if you ask. You may want to bring your own dryer sheets if you use them as they are not provided. You are given beach towels, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, soap, and lotion, so don’t bother bringing these toiletries along with you. The hotel does not have a restaurant or a bar on the ground, and at first I was disappointed, but there is every kind of restaurant and bar that you could possibly want within an easy walking distance, so it was perfect!! The location of the hotel cannot be BEAT! Everything you need is within walking distance. One word of advice, I would request a room as high as possible simply because the city noise could be distracting at night if your room is close to the street. The pool at the hotel leaves a little to be desired as it is a bit small, however, it is rarely crowded, so there is plenty of swimming room if you choose to utilize it.  The cleaning service at the hotel always goes above and beyond, even washing dishes and changing the sheets daily. They even leave little snacks on your pillow each day.   In the spirit of saving the best for last, I’ll talk about the wonderful staff that works at the Towers! The employees of Aston are the best part of the hotel. They would move the moon for you if they could! Russ always has a friendly, happy smile and wishes you well as you walk out of the hotel and welcomes you back when you return. He has great suggestions for shopping and activities to do while in Oahu. Ed was another employee who was helpful and fun. He went as far as to not only give us advice about the return transportation to the airport, but he booked it FOR us. Gregg is also extremely friendly, and I enjoyed talking to him about how much better our UGA Bulldogs were than the Hawaii Warriors in the Sugar Bowl!! :-) Gooooo Dawgs, right Gregg? :-)  During our stay, we went to the Paradise Cove luau, which is said to be the best luau in Oahu. Hands down, the BEST activity we did was horseback riding on the beach. The Polo Club on the North Shore ( http://hawaiipolo.com/trailrides.asp ) does very small group guided horseback rides for very reasonable prices. You actually ride along the beach for part of the time, and for you “Lost” fans, you will ride on the beach where the plane went down in the first episode of “Lost”. Another fun “Lost” fact, one of our tour guides looked identical to Sawyer (ie: Josh Holloway) from Lost. That was just an added bonus!!   One tip I wish I had known about Hawaii in general was to bring very few clothes along with me because the sundresses, shirts, etc are very reasonably priced and ubiquitous on the strip. I bought 6 t-shirts for $20 and a sundress for $16. There are ABC shops literally on every single block. These are small stores that have everything from toiletries and clothes to alcohol and souvenirs.  To sum up my thoughts about this incredible week spent in paradise, pack lightly and fill your suitcase while you’re there, stay at the Aston Waikiki Beach Towers, and lastly, spend longer than a week if you can! There isn’t enough time to do everything in a week! Have fun and relax! Aloha!",Jun 2009,June 2009,Traveled as a couple,,"Athens, Georgia"
31746011,50,A heavenly Place to stay!!!,"My Husband myself and my parents stayed here from the 28th May, 2009 through to the 5th June, 2009. I have stayed here before in December, 2008 and was so impressed then that I returned again 5 months later. We live in Sydney Australia and travelled to the mainland first, spent two weeks in Los Angeles the went to Honolulu for 8 nights. The staff at this hotel are to be commended on their excellent customer service. A few names that I will remember will be Kent, Gregg, Ross & Milly. Their attention to detail and their friendly manner make this hotel a fantastic place to stay. Upon arrival we were greeted by Kent, who upgraded us to a Penthouse Suite, he then took us personally to our suite and was genuinely interested in our holiday. My parents arrived from Australia the following morning and were suitably impressed by not only the staff but the Suite itself. My parents are both hard markers and could not fault the hotel. Many people I know will be visiting Hawaii this year and as this was my twelth trip to the USA will know that the places I recommend will be the places to stay. My husband and I only returned to Sydney last night, but have already decided to go back to Honolulu in the next few months. Aston Waikiki Beach Tower should be very proud not only of the complex and services they offer but of their people that work for them. Nothing is too much trouble!!  I will definitely be returning again this year!!!",Jun 2009,May 2009,Traveled as a couple,,"sydney, australia"
31441822,50,"Great hotel, staff, service and location!!!","From the 1st day my family and I were immediatly taken care of by the staff. Russ the valet was great. Everyone was great. The room we had was a 2BR/2BTH partial ocean view on the 11th floor and it was great with plenty of room. We were thinking about paying the extra money to upgrade to a full ocean view at checkin but once we saw the partial ocean view we knew we were more than satisfied with it. The second bedroom has two twin beds but you can request them to be bridged and housekeeping will immediatly come up and change it.  Beach towels, beach chairs, umbrellas, mats were all provided by the hotel. Free coffee is provided to use with the supplied coffee machine and if you need more all you would have to do is call the front desk and they would quickly run it up. We never had any problems with the A.C. The little bose stereo was great. Valet parking was free (but don't forget to tip...those guys work their butt off). And our room had free internet (wired)  I guess the only minor complaint I would have is the size of the living room tv and the awkardness of the remote but then again we didn't watch alot of TV in the first place so we didn't even worry about it. I guess if you do watch alot of TV you would get the hang of the remote. But on the bright side, it did have a tv in each of the bedrooms.  The Pool was good but a little bit on the small side but there's hardly anyone there so it all makes up for it. It was great to get away from the salt water a bit and relax in the hot tub also. There are also showers with soap and shampoo that the hotel staff kindly let us use even after we checked out and spent the day at the beach waiting untill we had to leave for the airport.  If your are planning on staying in Oahu then you must consider the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower. I know we will definitley be staying at the beach tower on our next trip to oahu.

29875131,50,Perfect Paradise Vacation! I couldn't ask for a better place to stay.,"The Aston Waikiki Beach Tower has a great location- right across the street from the nice part of Waikiki Beach (no coral to step on, smooth sandy bottom). There's all kinds of restaurants nearby- from super high end to low cost, so we had our choice of what we wanted to eat, and how much we wanted to spend.    It's close to Kapiolani Park, which is a great place to go to walk in the evening, or play in the day time. There's a place called Kapahulu Ave. just a few blocks away- you'll find all kinds of local, mom & pop restaurants that you won't find in Waikiki.    The folks who work at the Beach Tower are very friendly. Laid back, but right on top of things if you need anything or have a problem. They'll even let you play with some of their beach toys they keep in a closet near the valet.    The rooms are super nice. All the amenities you could want or need to cook and feel comfortable- like a home away from home. Great views. The a/c kept our place nice and cool and we slept easy b/c the room we had was pretty soundproof.    Overall, if was fantastic.

The hotel staff was friendly,helpful, and provided great service. We really liked our location, right across the street from the beach and within walking distance to tons of restaurants and shopping. We rented a car which was free to valet park at the hotel. We would definitely stay here again. We loved Oahu!. We enjoyed having the beach and scenery with city backdrop and plenty to do right outside our door during downtime from sight seeing.

28439438,40,Second Stay Here,"This was the 2nd time I have stayed at the Waikiki Beach Tower. The first was 3 years ago....there were 6 women on that trip. We had an excellent experience and since I was coming back with 7 others decided to stay here again.    The same friendly service was waiting for us. The bellhops were the SAME ones who were there the last time. They went out of their way, each and everytime, to be of assistance.... including helping us start the dead battery in our rental van. This part of the trip was an extension from a week on the Kohala Coast. There were 27 of us on that leg. I love walking into the room and having Hawaii music playing on the radio (we never changed the station.. not once), chocolate on the pillows and a nice large space. We were up higher last time and that had a much better view but , really, no complaints about the view. Saw many whales from our window.    The only complaints we had (and we had them from both of our rooms) were the beds. They were hard and stiff. We had some people using the sofa-bed and it was so bad they opted to sleep on the floor.    Other than that it was great!! The view is fantastic as is the location. And we had NO excess noise problems of any kind.    I would absolutely stay there again. Especially if going with a group. You pay for the room and can easily sleep 6. Two bathrooms too.",Apr 2009,March 2009,Traveled with family,,"Battle Ground, Washington"
27610103,50,Fabulous Family Vacation Location!,"Our party of six (four adults and two small children) just returned from a one-week stay at the Waikiki Beach Tower. I reserved a two-bedroom, two-bathroom premium oceanfront suite, which guaranteed us between the 25th and 36th floors. When I mentioned to the front desk staff that this trip was a surprise for my husband's 50th birthday they went all out to accomodate all of my special requests, and even gave us the 40th floor penthouse suite for no extra charge! The bottle of champagne and Godiva chocolates in the room was also a nice treat.    The service at this hotel is absolutely top notch. I have never stayed anywhere that provided such prompt and courteous service. Any request to housekeeping or the bell desk is swiftly and efficiently met. The knowledge and friendly service provided by the front desk and bell staff regarding sight-seeing, dining and transportation is comprehensive and excellent.    Likes:    The view is stellar! If you want complete, unobstructed views of both Diamond Head and the hotels along Waikiki beach (which look amazing lit up at night) ask for an 03 or 04 series room (the two rooms that protrude farther out at the front of the hotel) and a floor above the 22nd. From the 22nd to the 25th floors you may hear noise from the roof-top air-conditioning units of the adjacent buildings, so if you think that will bother you then ask for a higher floor. You are guaranteed at least some view in virtually every room in the hotel, but if you want the best of the best, ask for 03 or 04 series above the 25th floor. You will pay extra above the 25th floor, but at least you will be guaranteed an unobstructed view. If you are the gambling kind, you could pay less and reserve a deluxe oceanfront room (floors 5 to 24) and hope to get upgraded to a higher floor at check-in.    Excellent location directly across from Waikiki beach with lagoon area for safe swimming for children. More active surf for adults and teens directly adjacent to lagoon area. Bell desk provides you with straw mats, beach towels and folding canvas chairs, which can all be returned on your way back to the room so that wet, sandy stuff does not have to be carried into your suite. Public washrooms are a bit farther down the beach, by the police station (or just pop back into the hotel and up the 4th floor locker rooms by the pool).    Rooms are incredibly spacious. The decor is not luxurious, but everthing is very clean and functional. Kitchen is adequately stocked with cooking/eating utensils for six people. If you are a gourmet chef you may want to bring a few of your favorite tools along, as what is provided is fairly basic. Fridge has ice and water in door. Full-size stove and oven, rice cooker, blender, microwave and coffee pot (with coffee, sugar and coffee whitener provided - which is replenished each day). Salt and pepper are provided.    Washer and dryer in ensuite is very handy. Small capacity stacking unit though, so if you think you will be doing a lot of laundry, you may want to bring some detergent from home, as housekeeping provides one single load box each day (although you can call down for more at any time, and they will bring it up). Dryer sheets are not provided so throw a few from home in a Ziploc bag!    If you luck out and get a suite that has the ""Washlet"" installed on the toilet in the ensuite, make sure you try it! You will fall in love with the heated toilet seat!    Dislikes:    The mattresses are very firm, so if you are used to a cushy pillow-top (as I am) you will wake up stiff in the morning. The pull-out couch bed in the living room is very uncomfortable - but that is the norm with these, in my experience. The linens and pillows are very nice.    Tips:    If you are stocking up on groceries there is a Food Pantry on Kuhio St. (3 blocks north and about four blocks west of the hotel) but it is quite expensive. Decent selection, but as with everything in Waikiki, prepare to pay. A cheaper alternative is to head to the Safeway a short drive or taxi-ride away. Bell desk will give you instructions. Not really within walking distance, but the taxi fare would be worth the savings on the groceries and it is a lovely store.    VIP Car Rental agency is very nearby. Price is half of Enterprise or Budget, but the owners are a little sketchy and the vehicles are far from deluxe or well-maintained. We had no problems with the vehicle we rented and appreciated the savings when everything else in Waikiki costs and arm and a leg. Parking at the hotel is free, which is very rare in Waikiki from what I hear. Valet service is speedy and efficient.    All in all, staying here is a fantastic experience. Can you get way cheaper hotel rooms in Waikiki? Absolutely! At $475/night our room was very comfortable for 4 adults and 2 children. I'm sure that we could have rented two basic rooms at another hotel for much less. But would we have had the spectacular view, top-notch service and spacious suite, with a full kitchen and washer/dryer in the room? Probably not.

25417319,50,Awesome rooms and location,"We stayed here for 10 days in February and truly enjoyed the experience. Our room was on the seventh floor and a two bedroom unit. It was huge, with lots of room for the kids and a big, fully equipped kitchen. The in-room laundry was also a plus, and the hotel provided detergent. The hotel is located very conveniently on Kalakaua Ave., the main strip in Waikiki, and the beach is right across the street. The beach (Kuhio) is perfect for young children as there is a man-made breaker that stops any surf from coming in, so kids can splash and swim in wading pool still water. If you want a bit more surf, you walk a few more yards down the beach and it is there.  The building is not new, but it is very well maintained and very clean. What it lacks in luxury it makes up for in many other ways. First, there is no nickel and diming going on here. When we got the bill at the end of teh stay we were surprise to find it was exactly what was quoted to us. No parking fees, resort fees, swimming fees, laundry fees, etc, etc. It seems resorts nowadays just hammer you with fees for simply using the resort. It drives me crazy and happily it didn't occur here. Maid service was twice a day, coffee was supplied and refilled daily, boogie boards, umbrellas, beach towels and anything else you need on the beach were there for the asking free of charge. How nice for a change. The staff were friendly and helpful. We called one day because our TV remote didn't seem to work and they sent a maintenance guy up before we practically hung up the phone. The only negative would be the swimming pool. This place clearly used to be an apartment and the swimming pool is small and the sun is blocked by a neighboring building. However, we walked through the grounds of several hotels and resorts (including the Hilton Hawaiian Village) and I found by and large the swimming pools were really small. I think the hotels here are just older and not as much emphasis was put on the pool area as some newer places. Also, the beaches are just so spectacular that you really don't need a pool. Also, cab drivers and others sometimes confuse this hotel with the Waikiki Beach Hotel, also owned by Aston, but not nearly as nice.  We were concerned about going to Waikiki and were led to believe that we would be surrounded by geriatrics in leisure suits and T-shirt shops. What a pleasant surprise to find all age groups and demographics represented here. There are tons of great restaurants (with a Zagat guide to help you choose) and plenty of shopping if that is your thing. The architecture is stuck pretty much in the 50s and 60s, but efforts have been made to spruce the place up a bit. We were right next to the zoo and the aquarium and spent many hours enjoying ourselves there, but also took a day trip to Sea Life Park and swam with the dolphins. It's half an hour away, but you get a glimpse of the beauty of the windward side of the island that left me wanting to explore more. We never did rent a car as we found it unnecessary, but I would rent one in advance next time so that we could do some more day trips to other sides of the island.",Mar 2009,February 2009,Traveled with family,,"Vancouver, Canada"
25350779,30,Great Location - Adequate Accomodations Not Deluxe,"Just spent 10 nights in a 2 bedroom condo at ResortQuest/Aston Waikiki Beach Tower. Stayed in 701 requested a higher floor - not granted. This qualified as deluxe oceanfront. The master bedroom did not have a balcony (we were told it did) just the dinning and living room areas. The location is great we have 2 small children and walked to the zoo and aquarium and the beach was safe for kids. The location and amount of space were great. Plenty of closet space, kitchen, washer/dryer, 3 TVs. Not cheap you pay for space with a 5 and 4 year old.    Cons - 7th floor not high enough to drown out the garbage truck noise which is in the back of the building. Condo rugs and furnishings need to be replaced. Staff cordial not overly friendly. Front desk called on day 9 of a 10 day stay to see if we needed anything - how about calling day 1 or 2? Valet/Bell staff were the most outgoing and helpful during our stay. Made two requests the entire stay - higher floor and extended check out both were denied. They did let us shower in the 4th floor locker room which was helpful since check out was noon and our flight was at 9pm.

25170897,40,"Great staff, good amenities in the rooms","As all the other reviews have said, the staff is great. They are very friendly, efficient and helpful. The free valet parking was great, especially when traveling with a baby.    The location was also good. It was within blocks of numerous restaurants. While the Towers offers room-service, I can't see that it is used much as even basic items were approximately $20. However, that doesn't matter much with all of the options for take-out and a full kitchen.    Our room, number 603, was a deluxe room with great ocean views. The room was clean and the staff was great with twice daily service. Our room was not remodeled and did not really reflect some of the pictures I have seen of other rooms. Our kitchen had old tile that was chipping, the carpet had numerous stains and the bathroom sliding door did not really close. Nevertheless, it was nice not having to be overly concerned with a young baby on the trip. Also, you can't beat having a kitchen to deal with bottles and feedings and the washer and dryer.    The rooms are totally sound proof, unless you opened the balcony doors to hear the ocean and the sounds of people enjoying Waikiki. The rooms are also huge and have plenty of space if you have a family and all of the accessories that a child travels with. If you are not content with swimming in the ocean, which has a great swimming area just accross the street, don't necessarily count on the pool. It is not heated and the weather was not warm enough when we were there to heat it.",Feb 2009,February 2009,Traveled with family,,Oregon
25114753,50,the people make the place,"I have stayed at 3 other hotels in Waikiki in the past, and this place is my new favorite. I went to celebrate my friend's birthday, and she rented 2 suites for those of us attending. The suites were excellent-full oceon view, clean, and the lanai is most certainly the largest one I have ever been on in Waikiki. We had maid service twice a day. First place I have been where they actually leave you lots of towels. The oven was not working and within 20 min. a man came to repair it and he was hilarious, and was soon involved in our conversation. The valets and security people were hands down the best-they were cheerful, extremely helpful, and had a great sense of humor. Ed and Gregg were my outstanding favorites. They remembered who you were, and let me tell you that is the first time that has happened. They seemed to go out of their way to remember you, and would go out of their way to talk to you. For example one of them commented that every time he saw me, I was running off to do something, and that I was never still for long-oh how true. I loved them. I will remember this as my most positive stay in Waikiki, as far as both accomodations and people go. And, yes Gregg, you are still the best looking guy in Waikiki-haha!!!!! I would highly recommend this place, and would stay there again, even if it is a bit pricey- what isn't in Waikiki???? At least you get what you pay for.

24768174,50,"Great Value, Location and Superior Staff","Our family of five (two adults, 3 kids) stayed in the Waikiki Beach Towers in Mid-February. From reservations through check-out, our experience was memorable. We reserved an upper level Oceanfront 2Bd/2Bth unit. It was my wife's and daughter's birthday in February. I mentioned this when making the reservation and received a follow-up call about a week later confirming the occassion from the hotel staff. When we arrived, there was a bottle of champagne, some Godiva chocolates and an upgrade to the 40th (top) floor in one of the penthouse suites. We told our daughter that we got the upgrade and the chocolates because it was her birthday - she was thrilled!    The housekeeping is friendly and courteous, the valet / front staff are exceptional. Prior to arriving I called to ask about whether or not to reserve a rental car, they offered great advice which helped my decision (Valet Parking is free). The kids get some sandtoys upon arrival. They provide laundry detergent for the in-unit washer/dryer and have a lovely entryway to the beach/ parking area. Check-out is a breeze. They call the day before check-out to confirm if you need anything to help out (baggage, taxi etc....). We're pretty low-maintenance people, but I doubt they wouldn't go to extreme lengths to ensure your stay is memorable. As one of the valets told me ""We're a flagship. It's all about the service for us.""    Nuts and bolts-wise, The 2+2 units are about 1200 - 1300 SqFt. There are only four units per floor. Units 1 & 2 are towards Diamondhead, Units 3 & 4 provide a great view of the coastline and city. We were in PH-3. Our view was spectacular and unobstructed. We could see Diamond head (the view is should be even more impressive in units 1 and 2). There is a Kingbed in the Master, two twins in the 2nd bedroom and a queen sleeper sofa. The kitchen is updated, slab granite counters and fully stocked with utensils etc.... The heated toilet seat with washer is, well, unusual for most Americans. My daughter got a huge giggle when she tried the washer. The pool / recreation area is on the 4th floor and there are some units very close to pool and the adjacent hotels. I think unit #4 on the lower levels would have some fairly obstructed views. The hotel is directly across from a protected area of Waikiki beach but set back one hotel width. There is a covered entrance from the street to the hotel which provides a buffer between the pedestrian and street traffic and the hotel. It's great and gives a safe, secure area for families with children.    Overall, if you're looking for great experience or have over four people in your family, the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower is my recommendation. Hotels are pretty close together in Waikiki and you may want to consider getting the higher floors to ensure the views, but our experience was unmatched during our trip.",Feb 2009,February 2009,Traveled as a couple,,Seattle
24415033,50,Great place to stay!,"I read about this place here on TripAdvisor, and the reviews were right on the mark. This place is great. Great location (right on breakwater at Waikiki beach - super for swimming, and right in the middle of the Kalakaua shopping for night life and people-watching). The staff is great - very helpful and accomodating. The free valet parking is very quick and easy to get in and out of. The condos themselves are very nice as well - not 5-star luxury, but very clean, well maintained, and well furnished. We have a family of 5, and this ended up being cheaper and much more comfortable than getting two hotel rooms someplace else. We saved alot of money by cooking some of our own meals and eating them on the lanai, overlooking the ocean and the people below, which made for some very special family dinners. If you stay here, definitely upgrade to the ocean view - it's worth the extra bucks due to the great location (great sunsets in the evening, peaceful mornings watching the surfers, and just plain relaxing to sip a marg (blender provided too!) on the lanai and watch the beach activity below while enjoying the warm ocean breezes).

24284983,50,Better than terrific!,"Just spent two weeks in the Waikiki Beach Tower hotel. The hotel rivaled in many ways, and exceeded in a few more ways, my own home. The location would be the equivalent of having a 24 hour doorman apartment at East 71st. and 5th Avenue in New York, which happened to include valet parking and twice-daily housekeeping. The heated toilet seat is the first thing I've ever seriously contemplated stealing from a hotel room. I was only on the seventh floor, but the view was exceptional. The hotel staff were professional, but very friendly, learning my name, asking about my hometown, interests, etc...    Twice-daily housekeeping, high quality linens and bed, spotlessly clean bathroom and full kitchen, free valet parking (in Waikiki?!? unheard of), killer view, high-speed ethernet connection, friendly doorman... I don't know where to stop. It's a really well executed product.    Something of note is the construction of the building. This building is dead quiet. Literally only once did I hear a peep from the room next to mine, when I was standing in the hallway waiting for the elevator, but I think they were just inside their own doorway, and it was muffled. There was no noise transmission inside the room, ever, in two weeks. Outside noise is another thing. Mostly what I heard was the pounding surf from the beach just across the street. If there is something, like a delivery truck across the road for an extended length of time, you can just shut the (large) sliding glass doors shut for the duration, which more or less has you covered.    I never saw a bug the entire time I was there. Also, though the lot had little room for landscaping, there were literally dozens of different, incredible palm specimens.

24038479,50,We will definately be back!!,"We just got back from a WONDERFUL stay at the ResortQuest Beach Tower condos. We traveled to Honolulu with 4 adults and two children (4 and 1), so it was the perfect spot. From the moment we made the reservations, I was impressed at the customer service. When we arrived, we were treated like royalty. The lobby is simple and VERY nice, the valet staff was incredible, so so nice and helpful. After checking in we were escorted to our condo and showed around. We originally were in one fo the remodeled rooms and they are beautiful. We asked for a room higher up, so we opted for a non remodeled room and it was still GREAT. No granite but who cares, your in hawaii. The rooms were spacious and the living area was big. We spent a ton of time on the huge balcony overlooking the ocean, perfect! I could go on and on about this condo! We have stayed in many hotels from Ritz Carltons, Marriotts and many others and we LOVED this. You dont get the big pool or restaurants in the lobby. The jacuzzi and pool were simple, but we were at the beach anyways. Who need hotel restaurnt, we walked to many near by. I LOVED the fact that it wasnt crazy with people and hussle and bussle, nice and relaxing. The customer service was top notch. We had one little issue with the sliding door and it was fixed within 20 minutes. They provided a high chair and cirb at no charge and had ample beach towels. The maid service was top notch too. We wish we were there right now! Stay there, you wont regret it!!!",Jan 2009,January 2009,Traveled on business,,"Chino Hills, CA"
23315226,50,Couldn't be better,"Stayed at The Beach Tower for 6 nights over the Christmas holiday, my family of 4 from the East coast met up with 80 year old Grandma from LA and uncle from Oregon as a celebration of Grandma's birthday and served a a family reunion.  The staff couldn't have been more accomodating including Ed at the desk outside and Mike the general manager. Everyone was willing to help us make plans each day and to recommend how to get around the island (we did not hire a car and it was not necessary).  We were there the night that Oahu had its power outage that lasted well into the next day. Mike and the other staff could not have been more accomodating incuding entertaining the kids and helping to retrieve Grandma's diabetes medication from the 11th floor with no elevators available. The ways in which they handled this crisis speaks volumes about the kind of place this is; one can imagine how distraught people were becoming when they were on the 30th floor of a place with no elevators and there was no food or water available as all the stores closed.  The staff were calm, reassuring and in good spirits which generally kept the tourists feeling reassured!  This incident was only a small, but memorable, part of our stay. The condo was spacious, clean and had wonderful views of the ocean. The chocolate treats each night were great, as was the ""Aloha"" greeting that we got each morning as we emerged to go outside.  If we were to return to Oahu we would not hesitate in our decision to stay at the Beach Tower again; it is all that is advertised and much more.

22660651,50,AWESOME PLACE,"After returning from our family vacation to Waikiki, we're soooo happy that we chose the Waikiki Beach Tower for our trip. We arrived the first week of December to beautiful weather in Honolulu and drove straight to our hotel. We arrived to the hotel around 2:30 pm ( 3 adults, 1 child) to easy parking and check- in service. As described by previous post, I must agree that the staff is very friendly and helpful ( true Aloha spirit). I was assigned a renovated room on the 21st floor and ......wow, what a room. As compared to other hotels and resorts that we've stayed in and around Oahu, this has certainly been the best and not the most expensive. The ResortQuest Waikiki Beach Tower has everything a family would want for comfort. The rooms have full kitchen, DVD player, sofabed, comfortable bedroom, washer/dryer, fast elevators and lots of space. The place is AWESOME. Complimentary valet parking, beach is across the street, plenty of restaurants just steps away, the lanai is huge compared to the other places we've stayed in the past and the views are spectacular. The pool and spa close at 9:00 pm just in case you want to keep swimming after a day at the beach. Heartfelt thanks to Karin and the rest of the TOWER staff for sharing their hospitality with our family. I would recommend logging in to the ResortQuest website and viewing the Virtual tours which are pretty much ""right on"". Within our arrival home, our extended family is already asking questions after viewing our pictures and listening to our raving about our room. I can honestly state that this place will be our choice for future trips to Waikiki.",Dec 2008,December 2008,Traveled with family,,los angeles
22294610,40,Great location and size for the money,"We are currently staying in the Waikiki Beach Tower. The location to the beach is great. You can walk right across the street and it is within walking distance to many shops, restaurants, etc. We have a 2 bedroom partial view and got a great deal. You can still see the ocean from the room, but it is partial and not a full view as there is a building in the way. If that would bother you, definitely opt for the ocean front rooms.  Pros:  Hotel:  Staff is wonderful and very friendly. Ed remembered our name and was extremely helpful. A nice plus from much bigger hotels that don't provide personalized service. Also, the rooms are wonderfully sized. Although we don't spend a huge amount of time in the room, when we are here, it isn't crowded. We have 4 adults and 2 children. The decor is nice and most all units are being or have been updated. I would give the room a solid 4 stars, but not 5 as it is not ultra plush. Rooms are very nice and well equipped, though. We drove to Safeway which is just about a mile away to do some grocery shopping. We ate breakfast and lunch in our room. Saved us some money. Since it is right across the one-way street from the beach, it is very convenient to come up to the room and then go back down. The traffic on the street is not bad at all. Free parking is nice! W/D in room is also very convienient.  Beach:  The walk is less than 100ft. Very close! We did not have any problem finding room on the beach to spread out. Also, the beach is protected and a perfect place for kids to play without too many worries. Think of it as a huge salt water swimming pool, there is a lifeguard as well. The kids & Dad even snorkeled by the rocks and saw about a dozen different kinds of fish. Sand was great as well. To the right of the hotel, is Waikiki beach, also a great place to hang out and play. It doesn't have the protected (jetty) but awesome for body surfing, etc.  Cons:  If you are on a lower floor about 5:40 am you can hear the garbage trucks. It doesn't last very long, but if you are a light sleeper you should request and/or pay for a higher floor. The front of the rooms face the ocean, the back of the rooms face the next buildings and streets below. The beds we had in our room were very firm and hard, but others have not complained. We are used to very plush mattresses. The pool is chilly, but the kids only used it while we were getting ready, etc. In summer this probably isn't an issue.  And the worst thing is: at some point you have to leave.",Nov 2008,November 2008,Traveled with family,,Seattle
21382386,50,Feels like home!!,"We stayed at the Waikiki Beach Tower for 9 glorious days at the beginning of October. There were 6 girls and we had a 2 bedroom suite with a partial oveanview. Even though we were on the 11th floor, the view was SPECTACULAR!!!! The concierge was AMAZING!!!! We needed a van for the 6 of us and they found that a limo would be cheaper, so we got a limo to go to the flea market!!! Everyone was very friendly and always had a smile on their face and greated you with Aloha. They had great opinions and advice on where to eat, where to go, and what to stay away from. We even got to inform them about places that they have never been. We truely miss them all!!! Our room needed to be updated, but it was still a great place to stay for 6 girls and one room. Next time that we come back we will be sure to stay here. We were able to have breakfast on the lanai daily and watch the surfers. Will suggest this place to everyone going to Oahu.

21208944,50,Excellent place to stay,"We are two couples in our fifties who travel regularly together. This was our first trip to Hawaii and we stayed in a two bedroom/two bathroom premium ocean front apartment for 12 days from 23rd August to 4th September 2008. From the moment we checked in we were treated like royalty. Our unit 2503 was on the 25th floor so the view was magic. Housekeeping service twice daily, very friendly and efficient with the different little treats supplied each day adding a nice touch.  There was not one single thing that we could complain about and we would like to congratulate all of the staff for their committment to customer service. They made our stay a truly memorable one. The location is very close to everything in Waikiki and right across the road from the beach. We found it an easy stroll to the must see areas of the shopping and restaurant district.

20548244,50,"Spacious, clean, friendly and good location","We moved to this hotel from another Resort Quest property. We were in Hawaii to visit relatives. We were traveling with a 5 month old and loved this place.    The suite was spacious, clean and nicely decorated. There is a washer and dryer and free high-speed internet in the room! Also free valet parking. The staff were all very kind and personable. The location is great if you prefer to be a little removed from the tourist heart of Waikiki (I think a couple of arteries are clogged).    We enjoyed renting an umbrella close to Kapiolani Park and spending the morning on the beach and the PTH in the condo with the napping baby.    Excellent place, we will stay there again.

20113919,40,Wonderful stay and great staff.,"What a difference great staff make to a place. we stayed here for 7 nights in a 2 bedroom ocean front apartment and the positives far outweigh any defiencies.    the positives.  1)central location on the main waikiki strip, across the road from a protected beach.  2)we stayed on the 16th floor oceanfront room which was relatively recently renovated. nice size rooms and good size balcony.  3)twice daily maid service, which for an apartment is a rarity.With two kids, coming back to a clean apt. and fresh towels is a bonus.  4)great staff, friendly and helpful, esp. the valet crew.i must single out Mike the general manager. There were a couple of issues with the hot water system and air conditioning and he straight away offered an incredibily generous compensation.    the negatives.  1)the hot water was intermittent for a couple of days, due to changing over to a new hot water system.had a cold shower one day. but the problem's been rectified.  2)the view isn't panoramic due to the building being set back from the street and a couple of tall buildings on either side obscuring side on views. so unless you're above the 25th floor you wont get that 180 degree ocean view.    all in all a great place to stay.",Sep 2008,September 2008,Traveled with family,,"Sydney, Australia"
19667430,50,A General Manager who truly went above and beyond!,"I must first preface this review by stating that I came to Waikiki for a family trip with my wife's relatives, our 10 month old baby and some high expectations from the property.    I will cut to the chase for those of you who choose not to read the whole review, STAY HERE! The property is not only great for those with families, but for anyone looking for quality and comfort at reasonable rates considering all the space and amenities you get.    We booked a deluxe oceanfront 2 bdrm unit and that is exactly what we got. In fact, the majority of these type of units are all recently remodeled, which makes a huge difference. The kitchen area is very practical, microwave, stove, full fridge, dish washer and all the dishes and silverware you need. They even had a rice maker. The one complaint I had was that they did not replace the paper towels and fill the salt and pepper shakers when low.    The living room is VERY large and spacious, easily the center of all the living space. The balcony is great, it wraps around the living room and kitchen and provides a great area for rest and hanging wet items.    The bedrooms are both very usable. Not much to say here except, no complaints. They also have a smaller capacity washer/dryer and even give you single load refills of tide for the laundry. If you want more, just ask the twice daily housekeeping. The housekeeping comes in a group of 2-3 people and are in and out quickly and very friendly. They even leave you a little snack on your pillow at turn down.    As I mentioned, we brought a 10 month old baby and thus, as first time parents, were and are always worried about bringing enough items for the baby and sleeping arrangements for the baby. I even went so far as to email Mike, the general manager of the hotel ahead of time to request a crib and ""their best crib"" at that. I had read other reviews below where people were not happy with the crib quality and had to rent them from outside vendors. When we arrived, the condo was spotless, however, the crib was not up to our high expectations. In fact, it probably would not have met our lowest expectations at that. To describe, the crib was made of metal,m about 1/2 the size of a normal crib with a flimsy foam mattress that my dog would not like to sleep on. I called down and spoke to Mike, the GM and he recalled our email exchange and told me that the hotel had concerns about cribs and potential baby health issues by providing bedding and crib pads, etc... I explained that I could not use the cribs they provided and before I said anymore, he let me know the head of housekeeping would go out and get us a crib that was more to our expectation. By the end of the day, the hotel actually went out and purchased a brand new, full size crib made of cherry wood, all the bedding and bumper pads and delivered it all set up to our room. I can not express how much this made our trip perfect, since we had one huge less worry for our baby. Mike truly went above and beyond by making this happen. I can not believe any other property would care that much about guest satisfaction.    My best advice is, if you are not happy with something, speak up and let the properties actions speak for itself.    If I even go back to Waikiki there is not doubt where I am staying. If you have a family, this is your place.    Location wise, it is prime, right across from the protected beaches where the waves don't come directly in, next to the Duke K statue and near all the major shopping. Plus, only 1/.2 mile away, a brand new just opened Safeway Market, which you will make a few trips to, in lieu of the nearby Food Pantry.    In addition, you get free valet parking with valet staff that is always courteous and seem to have been there for years. They really help out and serve as the true ambassadors of the hotel.    Plus, no need to buy the beach mats, towels, floats, etc... at the ABC store, just ask the valet and they have all the pieces left behind by past guests for you to use.    Thanks for being a great place to stay,",Sep 2008,August 2008,,,"Arcadia, California"
19484467,50,Love the Beach Tower. It has become our home away from home.,"Seven years ago, I asked a travel agent to recommend the best place for a family to stay in Waikiki and she said the Beach Tower. We were drawn to the 1200 s.f. rooms, awesome ocean view, air conditioning, pool and great location across the street from the beach. But it is the wonderful staff that has turned our family vacation into an annual trip to the Beach Tower for seven consecutive years. The General Manager, Mike Tasaka, is always gracious and must be a great manager because most of the staff that was there on our first trip is still there today. The front desk is always professional and the valets are amazing. Greg, Mandy, Ed, Russ and his brother (to name a few) always welcome us so warmly and are full of information on where to go and how to get there.  We spend alot of time at the beach and love that the guys will hand us beach towels and mats on our way out and take the dirty towels back from us upon our return. (My husband always stores his surfboard downstairs at no charge). The location is very convenient. If you ever get to the beach and have forgotten something in your room, it's only a two minute walk back to the room. The location is also great for dining out since there are so many places to choose from. But since the condos have a full kitchen and dining area, we usually dine in for breakfast which works better for us since we have children.  If you have a family of four and plan to stay somewhere for more than a few days, a hotel room gets pretty cramped and a suite is usually cost prohibitive. These condos are very spacious and are perfect for our 7-10 day stays. Unlike many condos, the Beach Tower has daily maid service and a nightly turn down at no additional charge. I love a clean room and our kids love the treats that are left on their pillows every night. Having a washer/dryer in the room is also a plus since it enables us to pack light. I could go on and on about this place...",Aug 2008,July 2008,Traveled with family,,Malibu
18511097,50,Resortquest Waikiki Beach Tower makes you feel like a millionaire!,"First of all, I am reluctant to write this review, as the next time I want to stay at the Resortquest Waikiki Beach Tower it might be all booked up! I have wanted to come to Hawaii my whole life, and I can tell you that the Waikiki Beach Tower did not disappoint. When we arrived, my husband, my daughter and her friend were absolutely overwhelmed and floored with the spaciousness of the unit. The lanai was huge, and had four chairs, a table and a foot stool. We often ate breakfast out there, and the view was outstanding. You could see the beach clearly, and around 7:15 ish, you could enjoy a marvellous sunset. The kitchen was beautiful, with granite counters, microwave, full-sized fridge with ice maker, flat ceramic stove top, and overhead exaust fan, and all the amenities one needs to feel at home (toaster, coffee maker, utensils, dishes, even salt and pepper). The master suite had a tv and a king-sized bed...very comfortable. It had a walk-in closet, with safe (a huge plus), which adjoined a bathroom with two sinks, and in an adjoining shower/toilet room, was a washer/dryer combo, enclosed by a folding door. Having the washer meant we packed fewer clothes and had more room in our cases for souvenirs and Hawaiian clothing. It was a huge plus for washing and drying beach towels, swimsuits, etc. We used it countless times.  The girls' room had two twin beds, a tv, and a bathroom next door, which included a bath and shower. Having a separate bathroom for two girls was great, and very handy. It gave them their own privacy and personal space. The living room had a huge entertainment unit, which housed a flat screen tv and a dvd player. This unit was obviously renovated, the decorations were lovely and tasteful, and we were more than comfortable. In fact, the unit was so beautiful that we felt like we were millionaires living in luxury!  The location of this hotel is perfect. It's across the street from the sheltered swimming area (breakers off shore), so we felt very at ease, as my daughter is not a strong swimmer. It is right in the heart of everything. We could walk to shopping, several restaurants are nearby, a McDonalds was right at our corner, and the ABC stores were next door to purchase snacks, pop, sunscreen, etc. The walkway to the hotel has flowers everywhere, and there is a fountain with a statuette next to the driveway, which provided a great photo opportunity. The lobby is clean and welcoming, with a flat screen tv and comfortable chairs and a couch. The valet parking was a huge plus, and we enjoyed having quick and easy access to our car. The valets, by the way, were outstanding, and they always were willing to help and to direct us. These gentlemen deserve a lot of praise, as they made us feel welcome and comfortable throughout the entire duration of our stay. We also felt very comfortable having security at the entrance as well. One of the guards was very helpful and friendly...I should have taken note of his name. It may have been Brian. Gregg (one of the valets) went out of his way to explain to us how to get to the Swapmeat at the Aloha Stadium. Mahalo, Gregg!  The front desk staff were always obliging. They explained directions, gave me maps, and one gentleman even helped me stick stamps on my postcards!!! The check-in and check-out process was quick and easy...no hassles. The bill was correct and everything was explained to me clearly. The front desk helped us with currency exchange, and they were always willing to give me small change for larger denominations when I needed it. Also, each day we received a newspaper at our door, with a lovely note from the concierge (Karin), highlighting some of the history and attractions on the island. This was absolutely charming, and such a thoughtful add-on to the paper.  We enjoyed having twice daily cleaning service. In the evening, the girls always rushed to their room to see the treat that had been left near the bed, by the maid...from chocolate-covered macadamia nuts, to Godiva chocolate wafers, to coconut rice treats etc. The turndown service in the evenings was a lovely touch and we enjoyed having access to additional towels, extra Tide for washing, etc. The lady who came in the evening was always pleasant and helpful.  We were on the 17th floor and we had no problem accessing our unit. The elevators were nicely decorated and always clean. We didn't use the recreation area much, but my daughter and her friend did use the pool on one occasion and said it was fine. They were more interested with the easy access to the ocean and Waikiki beach.  This particular property is outstanding...take note it is the Waikiki Beach Tower Hotel ( a condominium hotel). The unit we had was a 2 bedroom/2 bathroom unit, with full ocean view. This property is not a regular hotel, and I believe that some of those who wrote reviews in the past may have been confused with a similarly named property in the area.  Now that I have been completely spoiled and pampered, I don't know how I will ever stay in a regular hotel room ever again. In fact, on the last day of our trip, I actually sat down on the couch and cried. It was so hard to leave. We stayed right until our noon check-out time, and stood on the balcony for one last look at the ocean. I told my husband that I felt ""like a queen"" being at the Beach Tower.  I want to extend my thanks to the Resortquest Waikiki Beach Tower for hosting me and my family. We had to save for this trip for many years. I can't tell you when or if we can ever return, but if we can, we will most certainly choose the Resortquest Waikiki Beach Tower. I recommend this property highly to anyone and everyone, especially families with children. The memories of our vacation will stay with us a lifetime. One thousand mahalos and Aloha to everyone at the Waikiki Beach Tower Hotel.

18155953,50,"Overall, The ""BEST"" place to stay for a family vacation !!!","Just got back from a 6 night stay at the ResortQuest Waikiki Beach Tower. This was our family's first trip to Hawaii. I spent alot of time reading reviews for all the family oriented locations to stay. We needed alot of space and wanted to be near the beach. Choosing the ResortQuest Waikiki Beach Tower was the best choice we made. Location, Location, Location. Throw on top of that the friendly staff. Can't beat the combo.    With a family of 5, we chose the 2Bedroom/2Bath condo. We received a fully renovated room. The condo had plenty of space so you never felt crowded in. Just like everybody says, the lanai is huge compared to the other hotels.  The condo comes with a fully equiped kitchen with a full size fridge. If you happen to leave dishes in the sink. The maid will wash them for you.  Knowing that there was a washer and dryer in the unit , we did not pack alot of clothes. We used W/D several times. Don't worry about detergent, they keep you stocked up. They do not provide fabric softener sheets for the dryer. No problem, just add it to your list when you stock up on your supply at Safeway on 888 Kapahulu Ave.    Other good amenities. ""Free"" Internet service. 'Free"" valet parking. If you check other hotels, they charge a mandatory $18 to $20 a day to use their parking garage if you have a rental. For our 7 day trip, we saved up to $140 staying at the Waikiki Beach Tower.    The staff at the Waikiki Beach Tower are alway friendly. They make you feel welcome everytime you get back from an outing.    Gregg and Russ at the valet station, Mahalo from each of my family member for making us feel welcome and taking the time to answer all my questions.  Any issue we had with our room was responded to immediately within 10 minutes and handled professionally. Thanks to the crew at the front desk and the maintenance team of the ResortQuest Waikiki Beach Tower.    Thanks again for a great time.

(Literally right across the street from the beach.) Staff was more than courteous and beyond helpful. Our kids, (15,12,8) had fun at the beach and in the pool.

18048621,50,Our all time favorite hotel/condo!,"Note that this is a condo-style hotel with full kitchens, living rooms and one or two separate bedrooms. There is a similarly named hotel that seems to be reviewed, sometimes negatively, in this section. ResortQuest Waikiki Beach TOWER is the condo-style facility that I am reviewing ... and it is absolutely fabulous! We stayed for eight nights in a 1200-square-foot, two bedroom suite on the 34th floor and could not have been happier. The condo was clean, nicely decorated and well designed with the living room walled with floor to ceiling windows overlooking a fantastic view of Waikiki. The full kitchen had a pass-through window to the large lanai where we had breakfast each morning. The two bedrooms were on the mountain side (back) of the hotel and had lovely views in that direction. The suite includes an apartment-style washer/dryer and the housekeeper left a box of laundry detergent each day. The ability to do laundry in the room makes packing for an active family much, much easier. We had two full bathrooms in addition to the full kitchen, which worked very well for our group which included my husband and myself, our two teenagers and my mother-in-law. The beds in the second bedroom are twins, but the sofa in the living room makes into a decent double or queen sized bed. The master bedroom has a king bed. The housekeeping staff services the rooms twice a day, including turndown with different Hawaiian treats left on the pillows each night. Parking was free (!), which is no small amenity in Waikiki and you can either have the valet park your car or you can park it yourself since the parking is in the hotel. Valet service was also very quick when we needed our car. The hotel is a little difficult to find the first time because, although has a small front entrance on Kalakaua, you drive into the valet area which is on the side street (Liluokalani -- which is one way from Kalakaua to Kuhio). The hotel is next door and slightly behind the ""circle hotel"" which is pretty easy to identify due to its circular shape. Like other hotels in this area, the Waikiki Beach Tower is across the street from the beach, and is right at the area where part of the beach is protected by a wall. That makes it easy to choose whether you want to be in a protected area with smaller children (or you just want to swim without dodging surfers) or you can choose to be in the unprotected area where you can surf, go out in catamarans, etc. The hotel is a couple of blocks from the International Marketplace and within a few blocks of many good restaurants and plenty of shopping. We have visited Oahu many times and have stayed in a number of hotels in the Waikiki area, but I doubt we'll stay anywhere else if we can get a suite at the Waikiki Beach Tower. You can certainly find hotels that are more luxurious, but for a family, I can't imagine a better place than this. Just make sure that you are booking the condo-style TOWER, not a similarly named hotel.",Jul 2008,July 2008,Traveled with family,,"Hot Springs, Arkansas"

17289482,10,Nothing but problems!!!!,"This hotel is truly the worst experience we've had on our trips to Hawaii. This hotel is rated highly but the rooms are dated, with many maintenance issues that are not fixed satisfactorily. Our room stayed in the mid-seventies although our thermostat was set on 65, so the extra money we paid for an ocean view was lost as we had to keep our curtains closed to try and keep the room cool. The bathtub drain didn't work and you stood in a foot of water taking a shower - how did they clean the tub with that? While it got fixed, the toilet leaked all over the floor, while at the same time making an incredibly high ""shreaking"" noise every time it was flushed. The toilet had to ""have a part ordered"" - are you telling me that a hotel with twenty plus floors does not have extra parts for toilets - the most commonly used facility in the hotel?? We were unable to access the internet, had to have someone come in and physically turn it on, yet another time we had to wait in our room to get something fixed. The elevators - they are ""secure"" - but when you are supposed to go up you go down and vice versa. One day we had to walk down from our floor to get out of the hotel because the elevators ""weren't working"". We were offered to change rooms but since we had already unpacked, the inconvenience should not be placed on us. This hotel is NOT anywhere worth the money we paid for it and definitely NOT anywhere near the rating given. The response from management was non-existent and the lacksadaisical attitude from the front desk staff was just insult to injury. Whether a family or couple, this is an awful hotel. The pictures are deceiving for the rooms, what you pay for and expect is NOT what you get.",Jun 2008,June 2008,Traveled as a couple,,Alaska
17201283,50,Excellent Stay at Resortquest Waikiki Beach Tower,"We (myself, husband, and two boys aged 14 and 11) stayed 6 nights at the Resortquest Waikiki Beach Tower. We had a fabulous room on the 38th floor. It was spacious (I can’t imagine staying in a regular hotel room anymore) and totally remodeled with granite throughout (kitchen and bathrooms). The views of the beach and Diamond Head from our room were unobstructed. We enjoyed watching the fireworks on Friday night (approx. 8:00pm). We also had a view of the movie screen on the beach, a partial view of the entertainment shows on the beach, and of course a full view of the surfers at Waikiki Beach. Although the OVERSIZED balcony was the best spot for viewing, the views from the master bedroom (which must be requested) and family gathering area were also outstanding.    The room was very spacious and welcoming (Thanks to Tomo for accommodating us). The NBA Western Conference Champions (LA Lakers) were playing in the finals during our stay (Thanks to Scott for keeping us updated). The staff at the facility were very nice and warmly greeted us whenever we passed through the lobby. The security guards were also very kind and could be seen walking the property on a regular basis. They also greeted us whenever we passed, making us feel safe and feel as though they knew who was staying at the hotel (Thanks guys).    My boys brought their X-box 360 and were ecstatic about being able to connect their “gear” at all three T.V.’s even though the screens were smaller than they’re accustomed to and the T.V.’s were a bit dated. Nevertheless, it worked for them during our down time (which was not much as we were very busy). The room also had internet connection with a desk that faced the ocean view (Fabulous!).    The kitchen had all the necessities and we were thankful because we cooked a few meals at the hotel during our stay. We enjoyed eating on the balcony while watching the activity on Waikiki Beach. Although the hotel is located directly across the street from the beach, it felt as though it was located on the beach, as we were on the 38th floor with no obstructions to our ocean view.    We also liked having a washer/dryer in our room. It was very convenient to use for washing/drying swim trunks after the boys went surfing (they took semi-private lessons for the first time and were surfing within the hour). It also allowed us to pack lightly. Tide detergent was provided by the hotel.    The hotel also provided twice daily maid service. It was nice having the room cleaned twice because we returned often to change out of our beach clothing, shower, and prepare for the night time activities. After leaving for our night time activities, we returned to fresh towels, turned down beds, and little treats to enjoy (the boys loved the treats and tried to guess the type of treat they would receive each night). Although the treats were nice, we missed the comfort of a “dream” bed; however, the mattress provided was sufficient.    The hotel is still in the process of remodeling some of the rooms. We did not hear any noise from the construction work. One of the elevators was padded with carpet to prevent damage to it during the construction process. While this didn’t look very good, we appreciated being able to utilize it. Otherwise, the wait for the elevator could have been much longer. We were satisfied with the timely movement of the elevators. There were no restaurants at the hotel, but plenty nearby. We did not utilize the swimming pool or other amenities at the hotel nor did we go see what the areas looked like. We were too busy traveling around the island. We rented a car during our stay and were happy with enjoying the sites at our own leisure.    In conclusion, we enjoyed the great location, panoramic view, and spacious (2-bedrooms) condominium style room. We were happy with our selection, as we were able to ENJOY our VACATION without feeling cramped in a small hotel room. We plan on returning to the Resortquest Waikiki Beach Tower.",Jun 2008,June 2008,Traveled with family,,CALIFORNIA
17262770,50,PERFECT FAMILY VACATION!,"This was our 2nd and final stop from Maui to Oahu. Our first family vacation trip to Hawaii and so I wanted it to be real special. I did my research and read the reviews this property had. I am so happy to have chosen such magnificent place to stay. We couldn't have asked for more - we had a beautiful unit (1103) with absolutely breathtaking views from our bedroom lanai to the living room. Everything was just perfect from the decor, the spacious bedroom with comfortable bed, the living room area, dinning area, the bathroom and not to mentioned the kitchen. WOW, kitcen was equipped with everything needed to cook. I just really enjoyed cooking/preparing meals for my family in such beautiful kitchen. But that's not all - our unit even had a washer and dryer which was just perfect. I mean what more can you possibly want? This, by far was the BEST!    The staff - THE BEST! So professional and always willing to help and answer any questions we had. Every morning and evening they would all greet us with big smiles in their faces. I mean these people were just all so friendly and happy. The lady in charge of cleaning our unit always made sure we had everything we needed from towels, toiletries etc. She would even leave us cookies and cinammon toast as treats. Mandy (Valet) was always cheerful and willing to assist in anything that was needed. He even called us immediately upon loosing our camera. We were devastated, since it was our first trip to Hawaii, but just when we thought all hope was lost here this wonderful man calls us and gives us the great news. Not to mentioned the very nice lady that found it and returned it. If you do read this we all say ""thank you""! Your kindness in returning it, is very much appreciated. We had valuable pictures in such camera of our wonderful vacation. Thank you all at Waikiki Beach Resort - Thank you for such wonderful stay, thank you for helping make this vacation a very memorable one never to be forgotten. Thank you all from the bottom of our hearts. We cannot wait to come back again next year June 2009.

17167443,40,Great location,"We stayed here on the 2nd stop of our honeymoon.    Hawaii is a place that I always wanted to go to and I was'nt disappointed.    We stayed here for a week and we really liked the hotel.  We got an honeymoon upgrade when we booked.  And when we arrived we were upgraded to a room with a king sized bed.However this room only had a partial sea view,whereas we had booked a full sea view.So we changed rooms.  The seaview was fabulous and we really were glad we changed rooms.  The room was a nice size but balcony had only one chair which was a bit strange.  The staff at the front desk were only okay to be honest.Particulary when we asked to be moved.One lady in particular was really unfriendly.  However all of the housekeeping staff and bellboys were really friendly.  The buffet breakfast on the beach was a great idea and the food was actually quiet good.  The hotel is in a good location but when we go back,we might stay further down the sea front.  I would recommend this hotel to friends,although some of the front desk staff need a bit of hug...!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Jun 2008,May 2008,Traveled as a couple,,"Dublin, Ireland"
16665737,40,Great location with plenty of room. Excellent staff! Lovely.,"Our stay at the Resort Quest Beach Tower was very nice. I just love the Resort Quest properties and this one certainly did not disappoint. Our group of 4 stayed from May 16 - 21, 2008 in a 2B/2B condo. It was mostly updated and had a wonderfully large lanai to enjoy breakfast on each morning.    We had a view of Diamond Head from the kitchen window and out one of the master bedroom and bath windows.    This condo gave all of us plenty of room without feeling crowded. The exception to this was the guest bathroom was very small and the hall closets were filled with shelving which made it challenging to find a place for the suitcases to live. We managed just fine.    Love having a washer and dryer in the unit. We used this several times and greatly saved on the amount of clothing we brought. Plus they replenish the detergent every day, which we didn't expect. The maids come in twice a day which was wonderful. Having the turn down service at night was always a pleasure. We found something different on our pillows each night. On our way back from dinner each night, we started to guess at what would be there.    The staff at the Beach Tower are wonderful as well, Everyone there was always friendly and willing to help with whatever our questions or needs were. Aloha definately resides here! The valets were great too. Greg and the others were very helpful with maps or directions to places as we headed out. They even pointed us to some very good places to eat. Thank you guys!!    The only problem we really encountered was the ice maker in the fridge was not working. When I asked about this, ice was brought to our room in about 5 minutes.    This was our first visit to Oahu. We've been to the islands 4 other times. Oahu was very nice and we enjoyed our visit. However, Waikiki is the 11th largest city in the US. It's a BIG city. You will have city noise around you and I noticed it while in the condo. One afternoon we were jet lagged and really needed a nap. Well, there was a jack-hammer going all afternoon on the sidewalk below. This prevented us from a much needed nap.    We saw the highlights of the island like the Arizona Memorial, Punchbowl, Diamond Head, Hanauma Bay, Chinaman's Hat, the North Shore, Byodo-In Temple, and others. There's just too much to see and do in one vacation.  Oahu is lovely and staying at the RQ Tower was an excellent location. Right across for a nice protected beach, all kinds of dining options are only a few minutes walk, and shopping!    If you are looking for more than a hotel room, this is certainly the place. With a complete kitchen, it allowed us to save a considerable amount of money on food. We had breakfast each morning on the lanai and prepared lunch there too.....or packed a picnic lunch if we knew we would be out most of the day.  Dinner was the exception. We went out each night and then walked off dinner by walking around window shopping or watching the street performers.    You can't go wrong with RQ!",Jun 2008,May 2008,Traveled with family,,"Grand Prairie, Texas"

16592171,50,Paradise within paradise,The is a marvelous place to enjoy Waikiki and Oahu. the staff are exceptional. I have been coming back to the Beachtower for more than 20 years and many of the staff have remained all of these years. It is like having a marvelous home in paradise. I could never stay in a single hotel room after experiencing the Beachtower.    It is centrally located and one can walk to many places and enjoy toe beauty without having the hassle of driving to dinner. It is also a large place where families and friends can stay and have their space.    my favorite part is having coffee on the balcony every morning and looking at the surfers at Waikiki.    I highly recommend this experience to anyone.,Jun 2008,May 2008,Traveled with friends,,buffalo

15624411,50,Fantastic - We'll be back !,We stayed 8 nights located on the 24th floor. Rooms were fantastic with full kitchen with dishwasher & fridge with Ice dispencer. There was a sliding door onto the balcony from the kitchen - perfect for serving morning breakfast. The balcony was big and overlooked the beach. We had a 2 bathroom 2 bedroom suite. Heaps of storage area for clothes & washer / dryer facilities with maids leaving plenty of washing powder. Plenty of towles were never an issue with maids also coming to do a turn down service in the evenings. Front desk staff were very helpful with advice where to eat etc. Ideal location for the beach and the pool and Spa were also very good. Agree with other reviewers that you should try and get a 15th floor or above to make sure you get the best views.

15483034,50,Wonderful Family Experience,"Returned 4/29/08 after a week stay at the Beach Tower. This was our third visit to Oahu, but first to Beach Tower. Perfect marriage of condo independence with hotel service. No property is perfect, so here are the cons. (1) My unit, 2B and 2b, on the 6th floor was not as modern as the web photos and a little more worn than I expected (2) pool area a little small and hot tub really HOT. That is it! So the pros. (1) The service here makes up for any, and I mean any, shortfall. The staff is great and make you feel like you are the only guest at the hotel. I really can't say enough about the folks, from registration to the 100 or so time they retrieved my car from the FREE valet parking they were extremely dedicated to the guest. (2) Location, Location, Location! (3) Great size for Waikiki. (4) Tremendous value for price, this property does not charge you for any of the extras you should expect (valet parking, newspaper, internet, etc...)

15371803,50,Fantastic Stay at Beach Tower,"We travelled the US during March/April for 1 month . Family of 4 with 2 teenagers.  This was our last stop, after a long trip , on our way home.  I wanted something large to give us space from each other, in central location, on the beach with great views.  I researched hear on TA and came up with the beach tower.  We where not dissapointed  The tower is in an excellent location right accross from the ""rock pool"" and in the heart of all the shops and restuarants.  Our apartment was on the 24th floor, 2404, it was a renovated 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom apartment and I was extremely pleased with all the facilities. We had washer/dryer in the apartment , and the maids left me detergent every day. This was usefull as I completed all my holiday washing!  We had a full size kitchen (which we didnt utilise to potential) but was handy for breakfast and snacks.  Two enormous bathrooms, huge king bed in main bed, twins in the other room, plus a huge living/dining and the biggest balcony with amazing views  The tower does not have a restuarant but that was no problems, rewstuarants everywhere.  The staff where helpful and courteous, and Greg the bellhop was truly amazing with his help  We got a better rate by buying the hawaii entertainment book and calling the hotel, to which they honoured my booking at a reduced rate    I will definatley return to hawaii and stay hear at this fanastic apartment tower.

15338437,40,Will be back again,"Selected this property after reading Trip Advisor and were not disappointed. We stayed on the 20th floor in a 2 bedroom apartment. Huge rooms and balcony. Good beachfront view- we enjoyed sitting out for an evening drink watching the world go by and of course the great sunsets. The apartment was refurbished with modern kitchen. Having a washing machine and dryer was great.    Location is an easy walk to everything. Hotel is right across from the safe beach areas with walled in swimming = great for young kids. 100 metres to bigger but still safe surf. Lots of restaurants in walking distance. Also the trolley stop was just across the road. We only used this to go to Ala Moana but I think you could go further afield.    Hotel service was really friendly and helpful. Also rooms were serviced twice daily, an extra touch.    The only thing we didn't like were the lifts which were sometimes slow and occasionally one was out of service. A minor problem overall.

15150265,50,Was a great vacation,"Was pretty sure I knew what to expect after reading many reviews of this hotel. It pretty much lived up to the expectations.  There was a total of 10 of us travelling together, 4 adult and 6 kids. One family stayed in a 1 bedroom, and we stayed in a 2 bedroom. In our room there was 2 adults and 4 kids. Sounds kind of cramped, it wasen`t at all. The room was kind of dated, but very spacious, which worked for us. We were on the 6th floor, so I was not sure what kind view we were going to have, but the view still was very nice, we were able to see the entire beach from our lanai (it was a huge lanai as well). The entire staff here were great. Always willing to go out of their way, at any time, for anything that you may need.  The location was perfect, right across the street from the beach, with all of the amenities that one would need / expect.  The beach was awesome, the surfing was great (all 6 kids in the party surfed often), the resturants were very good, although rather expensive, and the people were super friendly.

14346806,40,Excellent Location - Weak on the Interior,"Just got back on March 14, 2008 - Spent two weeks there. We booked an Ocean View but upgraded to a Penthouse for an additional $50/night. The view was incredible but the interior is VERY DATED - you'd think the penthouse would be better than a Deluxe Ocean View but it was not - just a bit bigger in the hallway and the living room. The Linai was huge - enough to host a party in the Linai alone. The best: Convenient, Clean and Comfortable - very friendly staff - The bad: Interior design - dated furniture, Kitchen has everything but it's all from the Dollar Store - The elevators are old and slow especially when you are on the 37th Floor - sometimes, the wait can be 5 minutes. Absolutely no smoking - which was good. The 4th floor, which is where the swimming pool, hot tub and sauna are located was very old and dated - the hot tub and pool were functional but the sauna isn't - the pool table and tennis court are so old that you shouldn't bother trying to use. There is a convenient store and McDonalds right downstairs - Next to a 24 hour gym, which is great! Not recommended for singles - more for family. If you are on the 9th floor or higher, you don't hear much and get to see lots. Our floor was on the 37th so we had unobstructed views.",Mar 2008,March 2008,Traveled with family,,Toronto

There are two basic room types, center and end units. The center units have two bedrooms, with one bedroom facing the lanai and the other on the opposite side. Both 2502 and 3302 are center units.  The units are spacious and quiet with the largest and nicest lanais I've encountered in Waikiki. Views are simply amazing and the location just couldn't be better. The beach is just across the street, as is a free hula show each night at 6PM. All of Waikiki, the zoo and the aquarium are short walks away.  The staff have always been extremely courteous and helpful to us. Amenities are lacking; no pool or exercise area but there is free internet. Of course, each unit has a complete and very adequate kitchen along with all of the basics, including a small washer/dryer combo (adequate, but not the best).  Unfortunately, the units do show a bit of wear. Decorations are a little dated, paint is dingy in spots, and the bedroom door in both units tended to rattle a bit.

13890036,50,A pearl on Waikiki!,"We booked this property for our family vacation and were pleasantly surprised. We needed a place that could accommodate 5 people, since booking hotel rooms in Honolulu can be very pricey. When we arrived at the hotel the front desk folks were very friendly and helpful, they even upgraded us to an ocean view room from a partial ocean view. The front desk staff coordinated with the bellman to take all our bags up to the room, and the front desk person even escorted us up to our room to show it to us. The unit we were in, #801, had all new appliances, beds, and furniture, as well as granite counter tops. The room was spotless. To say the least we were very impressed! The hotel is directly across the street from Waikiki Beach, and a short 5-10 minute walk gets you to the heart of Waikiki. We never saw the housekeeping staff, but as stated in previous reviews, they do turn-down service and leave a treat for you, which is always nice after coming back from a busy say of playing tourist. We especially enjoyed having breakfast every morning out on the lanai, watching the surfers and beach-goers. BTW we never saw any ""critters"" in our rooms. There was wired internet access in our room, which worked well and was great to have so we could keep in touch with family and friends back home.

The other bedroom was smaller & had a window that opened to an enclosed walkway/hall. It was dark in the middle of the day. If you are sharing a 2 bedroom unit with another couple (& not your children) allocating the bedrooms could be a problem. They are not equal.    The ugly  I booked the most expensive unit possible on the ResortQuest website. When I checked in, I was offered an upgrade to a penthouse for an additional $70/night. We ultimately settled on $50/night. However, when I looked at the parking receipt I was given when I drove into the hotel, the preassigned room number they wrote on my receipt was the same room number I later paid to ugrade to.

11248714,30,"above average condo, good location","If you compare this property strictly to other condos in Waikiki, it is the second-best behind the Hilton Hawaiian Village Ali'i Tower (way behind, btw). But compared to other hotels it is just average. You can tell it's an older property, it has the 1970's A/C units that are pretty noisy, old fixtures, really old elevators, and it's just more functional than visually appealing. However, the rooms are quite large and the hotel is in a prime location in the heart of Waikiki and right across the street from the beach. In fact, from our room (which was a partial ocean view) we could see this stage where they bring out hula dancers every night at sunset. The weirdest thing was that our room was right in front of the pool, and I mean RIGHT INFRONT. No one really used the pool so it wasn't a problem (and it was pretty convienant to just climb over the railing and hop down, its elevated maybe 3 feet above the pool level), but I can imagine in July/August this might be incredibly noisy. Then, the tennis courts were right outside the bedroom window on the other side of the unit. This has to be the worst possible location in the hotel, I'm sure. That's just the one room though, all the rest I'm sure are fine. The bed in the bedroom was nice, but the bed in the pull-out sofa sleeper was horrible. Overall it's not terrible but not super awesome, it's just average. Unless you have a family of 4 or 5 I'd skip the condo and stay at a hotel next time, they're a lot nicer for the same price.",Dec 2007,September 2007,,,"Westminster, CA"
10774509,50,Fabulous for families,"We just returned from a 10-day stay at this hotel and have concluded that we've found our new home-away-from-home. We have been to Oahu about a dozen times pre-children, and now three times with children, and have to say that this property is just about perfect if you're traveling with little ones (our kids are three and six months).    The pros:    > The two-bedroom suite layout is fantastic. The master bedroom was easily big enough for me, my husband, our baby in a Pack N Play, and our son on an inflatable toddler bed. Our au pair and her boyfriend were in the other room, and we actually never felt crowded or that we lacked privacy.    > There's a full kitchen, including rice cooker, coffeemaker, microwave, full-sized refrigerator and freezer, large oven, garbage disposal, dishwasher, and probably a lot of other things we didn't notice. We ate breakfast, snacks, and about half our dinners in our suite -- it was great! And they just opened a new Safeway in Kapahulu, about a 5-minute drive away, so stocking up was a piece of cake.    > Lots of space in the living and dining areas! Great for active kids and for letting adults sprawl out. The provided DVD player was a godsend for itchy kids (we brought our own DVDs with us).    > Location, location, location! Everything is just a short stroll away. The best beach for little kids in Waikiki (Kuhio Beach Park) is literally across the street and features two sheltered lagoons perfect for beginning swimmers. There's a beach, some grassy areas with shade, and a freshwater shower right at the beach for rinsing.    Other kid-friendly destinations: the zoo, three short blocks away; the aquarium, which is a little further, but still an easy walk; Kapiolani Park, three blocks away with huge expanses of grassy space for kids to play (and great photo opportunities). For rainy days, the children's Discovery Museum, in Ala Moana park on the other end of Waikiki, is a 15-minute drive.    Foodwise, it's a treasure trove in kid-friendly dining. There's a McDonalds adjacent to the hotel, ABC stores on every corner (for snacks, drinks and premade sandwiches), and our favorite hang-out restaurant, Duke's, is a block and a half away. Cheeseburger in Paradise is across the street and Keoni's, a Thai restaurant that has a great traditional (American) breakfast, is a quick walk even with a straggling preschooler. Oh, and one more parental bonus: the hotel has room service! It's pricey, but it beats dragging fussy kids out to dinner.    Finally, the International Marketplace is about two blocks away and a great browsing treat for the whole family.    > The staff! They were exceptional. We couldn't believe how nice, friendly, and helpful everyone was. The guys at the bell desk/valet stand were just amazing, always ready with a smile, a destination recommendation (we discovered a fabulous locals-only spot for poke thanks to them!), and a quick game of catch with our preschooler. They were responsive to our requests (e.g., more beach towels) and did a great job checking us in and out.    > TONS of storage! Multiple closets with shelves throughout let us give the kids their own dedicated spaces. Easier for corraling toys!    > Free DSL. Yippee! Our au pair spent hours IMing her friends and family when she wasn't watching the kids.    The cons:    > Avoid the hotel-provided crib: it's made of metal with a foam mattress, not the firm type of mattress recommended by the AAP. We ended up renting a Pack N Play and some other items from Baby's Away Oahu (babysawayoahu@gmail.com), a company that supplies kid stuff to traveling families. Worth every penny!    > The hotel pool doesn't really have a shallow end; the minimum height is 3 feet. But it is heated, which is great!    > Slightly outdated decor, and a couch whose seat cushions kept sliding off.    > Believe it or not, the twice-daily maid service could get annoying. A few times we forgot to put in the do-not-disturb card, and we had to explain to the housekeepers that they couldn't clean because children were sleeping. But that's obviously a minor problem and the benefits outweigh the negatives!    > Expensive. But then again, cheaper than booking two separate hotel rooms, for the most part -- and you can't beat the convenience of a suite, plus the many amenities.    I could go on about all the great things about this place, but the bottom line is, we loved it and will absolutely be back!",Nov 2007,November 2007,Traveled with family,,San Francisco Bay Area
10438657,40,Family Fun,"Our Family stayed here for a week in the beginning of October. Our children are ages 1, 3, 5 and the amenities this property provides were perfect for our needs! We ran a load of laundry a day with all the swimming and exploring we were doing and the housekeeping staff caught on quickly and kept us well supplied with Tide :-). The kids loved the sandpails they received at check-in and the beach directly across from the hotel is very shallow and has a wonderful breakwater which kept big waves from wiping out our little ones. The staff were exceptionally courteous, espicially the valets! The 2 BR 2Bath unit we had was very spacious and the kitchen had everything we needed to make meals in (easier on the kids than eating out all the time). It's within walking distance of the zoo and aquarium and the Oceanarium is right across the street. McDonalds is right out the main entrance and was great for pancakes and fresh pineapple that we could bring back upstairs for the kids a couple of mornings.    They are currently remodeling, and the unit we stayed in hadn't been refurbished yet but we didn't mind. We worried much less about causing noticeable damage. Our 1 year old did manage to pull a handful of cables out of the cable box on one of the TV's and the maintenance staff that came to repair a broken one for us was so kind and even smiled and joked with our little perpetrator.    My only complaints would be... The maids always came between 1 and 3 when our two youngest were napping. They did light, quiet work but never adjusted schedule to come during a time when they could give us full service, vaccuuming, etc. Also, the evening turn down service with treats that the kids quickly came to look forward too was non-existent the last 3 nights. They were sorely disappointed! Also there was a problem with tiny little ants in the kitchen, we declined their offer to have an exterminator come in and use chemicals while our children were there and they never offered to move us to another room although admittedly we never asked.    Over all the amenities and location were ideal with only a few service issues.",Oct 2007,October 2007,Traveled with family,,WA state
10311109,40,upgraded!!,"We were booked into the ResortQuest Waikiki Beachside Hotel for 3 nights in October, however when we arrived we were pleasntly surprised to find we had been upgraded to the ResortQuest Waikiki Beach Tower! It is only 3 doors down & right on Waikiki Beach, they are in the middle of renovations presently, so things were a little different, check in was on the 4th floor, foyer was non existent, only two lifts to service all the floors, which sometimes made for a bit of a wait. We were on the 8th floor & when we stepped out of the lift the carpet was covered in plastic, however when we got inside our room, it was great! Beautiful balcony with magnificent views of Waikiki, the staff were sooo friendly, their was a washing machine & dryer, 2 TV's, fully equipped kitchen, with ice maker in the fridge!

10292912,50,wonderful spacious condo,"Aloha! We just returned from a family destination wedding. My family reserved a 2 bedroom 2 bath unit on the 28th floor with an awesome ocean view in front and Diamond Head view to the side. The location was wonderful...it wasn't the crazy busy shopping area but we were only a couple of blocks east from it. Finding the hotel in our rental car was a little confusing but thank goodness I read the reviews here. The hotel says it's located on Kalakaua Avenue but the car entrance is actually around the corner on the Lili~ street side. You will be greeted by the friendly valet guys (Aloha Eddy!). The lobby is currently undergoing construction so you will check in on the 4th floor. Since 10 of us went, we decided that a condo would be the best choice for us...6 of us stayed here (maximum per hotel policy) and the rest stayed at a less expensive hotel across the street. Whenever we cooked, our other family members hopped on over for the meals and we saved lots of money that way. There is a Food Pantry market a few blocks aways on Kuhio Street which was reasonably priced. Also, there were many ABC (convenience) stores which we loved...they sell ready-made sandwiches, cut-up fruit, souvenirs galore, cosmetics, wines/liquor, beach accessories etc. Back to the rooms...like the other reviews, it was very spacious...our little ones loved playing hide and seek...there was plenty of closet space and kitchen cabinet space (almost too much space for just 6 visitors). The kitchen and bathrooms did need some updating but they were functional. The hallway bathroom was a bit crampy and dim...but the master bath had a window with a wonderful view of Diamond Head. There was a tv in each room which was nice for the kids, adults and seniors in our party. The balcony was so spacious...don't feed the birds out there...they'll try and come into your room...luckily we shooed one out before it caused chaos inside. I didn't bother with the pool since I read the reviews here but my husband did visit it on the 4th floor and agreed that it was small...but he loved sitting in the jacuzzi.  Tourist attractions that we did:  Diamond Head (loved it but difficult hike because it gets too hot...cool off with yummy shaved ice at the base)  Alamona(?) Falls (loved it...slippery and muddy at times and many mosquitoes...my 3 and 5yr old did it)  Polynesian Cultural Center (loved it but Ali Luau package dinner food was blah..also, the show stadium is small so I think any seat is fine...no need to upgrade your seat which they may try to sell you when you first walk in the center)  Hanumau Bay (must see breathtaking views... but I thought the beach across from our hotel was actually better (not as pebbly...is that a word?)...food is pretty expensive but their $10 sandwiches and burgers were actually delicious)  Aquarium (you can see everything in 30 minutes...I'd skip it and go to Sealife Park...save your $9 per adult)  Sealife Park (much better...good for your kids...it's about $25 per adult and about $18 for 5yrs and up)  International Market Place (so so...you just see the same souvenir stands over and over...but check it out while you take your stroll down busy Kalakaua Avenue.  Also, the destination wedding place at Aquaveil Frais Marina in Kapolei was wonderful...it's a small cozy setting...perfect for party up to 50 people. The ceremony was timed with the sunset in the background. They wedding coordinators did a wonderful job with the reception...pleasantly surprised. Overall, we had an excellent time at Waikiki.",Oct 2007,October 2007,Traveled with family,,"Flushing, NY"
8709706,40,Good value and family friendly,"Our family stayed in a 2 BR unit on the 11th floor during the last week of August.    Positives:  Spacious and larger than we expected; plenty of room for kids to run around in living room  Outside patio is large  Excellent location across street from a small but family friendly beach with breakwater - perfect for little children  Free broadband internet  Free parking in the building  Pool is well maintained and clean  Concierge staff friendly and helpful; they genuinely look like they enjoy working there  Complimentary beach chairs, mats, towels they loan you when you go to the beach  Toy pails for the kids  Laundry machine in your unit and they even provide detergent    Negatives:  Building directly overlooks what without a doubt must the ugliest building in Waikiki  Numerous items were broken in our unit that should have been caught by housecleaning before we checked in (broken toilet seat, DVD player not working, internet cable snapped); all these things were pretty quickly fixed when we told them  The temperature in both showers fluctuated wildly from cold to hot  No restaurant in the building (the other reviews on this site about the Tiki restaurant are people who are posting erroneously about another similar sounding hotel 2 blocks up the street)  Self parking was often quite crowded and took a while to find a spot  Kitchen has very few cooking or eating utensils are provided  Pool is small and can get very crowded  No towels provided at the pool (on the 4th floor), you must bring them from your room or go downstairs to the valet on the 1st floor  Jacuzzi next to pool is way too hot  Funky smell in the room that came and went    Overall its a good value for what you get.

8708466,50,Wonderful condo and view!,"My mom, younger sister and I stayed at the Resort Quest tower the first 4 days of September. I didn't realize it was a condo when we booked it. The lobby was a lot smaller than I pictured it to be from all the reviews. As we were leaving on the 5th they were getting ready to redo the concierge and registration area. The employees at the registration area are very nice and accommodating.  We were first given a key to the 19th floor. Our key card wouldn't work and before we even had the chance to go back downstairs the front desk person was up on our floor apologizing that they gave us the wrong room. We were moved to the 12th floor.  The bell service was prompt w/ our bags and brought an entire box of Godiva chocolate!  The condo itself was amazing. We had a full kitchen/fridge, washer/dryer, 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms w/ wonderful showers, and 2 large sliding glass doors that brought you out to a gorgeous view from our lanai! The view alone was so incredible.  One of the drawbacks to the hotel is that if you are a pool person--not so good. The pool is off the 4th floor at the back..however there are another hotel's rooms basically at pool level. The pool is mostly under shade and there aren't too many chairs to lay out. Luckily right across the street is the beach! It is fun to watch the surfers out from your lanai off and on throughout the day!  There is also a turn-down service every night! One of the housekeepers come by around 6ish every night to turn down your beds, turn on the lights..and leave yummy local Hawaiian treats on your nightstand or bed. There aren't a lot of amenities here at the condo. The entrance is beautiful and they do have a feet/body wash area if you are coming in from the sand. The hotel is located nearby several restaurants/ABC Stores and if you have any tours scheduled the pick-up place is off to the right of the hotel across the street at the Pacific Beach hotel. Easy and not a big walk.  As for restarurants we tried several of them around town. We really liked Duke's on the beach as well as Lulu's about 4.5 blocks down the street. Great breakfast and wonderful service.  We were not impressed w/ Cheeseburger in Paradise or Tiki's Lounge/restaurant.  We were also lucky enough to stumble across a wonderful hula show right across the street by the beach a couple of times.  Our family did the Pearl Harbor and deluxe island tour as well as the Polynesian Cultural Center/Horizons show. We definitely reccomend the island tour. Amazing views and some great stops!  I really enjoyed the views in Oahu!",Sep 2007,September 2007,Traveled with family,,"Portland, Oregon"
8686976,50,An Unforgettable Holiday,"We had 5 adults in a 2 bdrm condo and we were more than comfortable. The condo's are very spacious with a large combined dining/living area, full kitchen, 2 bedrooms + sofabed, 2 bathrooms and large lanai. We booked a partial ocean view room but were upgraded to a full ocean view at check-in. The rooms have been refurbished and are very presentable and modern in comparison to other hotels with a hawaiian print overload. We received complimentary bottles of water in our room upon check-in and the staff are efficient and friendly. We were on the 24th floor and didn't find the lifts to be slow as previously mentioned on TA. International Market Place, Royal Hawaiian Shopping Centre are within 5 mins walking distance. We didn't get to use the pool and spa as waikiki beach is across the road. The hotel is clean and there is a twice daily maid service.

8686413,50,Can't beat the location! Great for traveling with kids.,"We booked our 2-bedroom unit directly with the owner. We had very nice ocean views. The best features of the condo were the location, the size of the condo and the friendly staff. Since we rented directly from the owner, we had an assigned parking space which was nice.    The property does not have a lot of amenities. There was a small pool on the fourth floor which we never visited. The kitchen was small but we did not need to cook a lot as there were so many restaurants close by.    The location was great. We just walk across the street to the beach and the kids were able to swim in the blocked off area of the ocean. The building was showing its age and there were some noises during the day time due to some other units' renovations. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay. We were able to sleep 7 people (including an infant and a 4-year old) comfortably in the unit.",Sep 2007,August 2007,Traveled with family,,"Walnut Creek, California"
8364557,50,Very nice apartment hotel for families,"My wife and 3 of our young children stayed here for a week in April 2007.    We had problems with our flight connection so we phoned at the last minute to say we would be arriving a day late. According to the reservation policy, we should have paid for the night we missed because we gave the hotel no notice. However the charge for that night was waived without any hassle or argument.    We stayed in a 2 BR oceanfront suite. The suite was huge. We cooked all our meals here in the full kitchen. The bedrooms were comfortable. There was no problem with noise. The view over Waikiki Beach was outstanding.    The only downside to the room was the decor, furnishings and carpet were showing their age. Nothing serious but everything looked a little worn. This was no problem for us as we were there for a fun active family vacation rather than a luxury resort type of experience.    The location of this hotel is perfect. Across the street from a nice quiet part of Waikiki Beach. The beach here has a protective breakwater forming a large shallow ocean swimming pool which is perfect for preschool age children. The hotel staff lent us chairs, umbrellas and beach toys whenever we went across the street to the beach.    The hotel pool was small and the pool area was extremely windy as it is elevated a few stories high. Gusts of wind would blow our towels etc. across the pool area. We could not enjoy much time at the pool because of the wind.    We had a late night flight out. We requested a late checkout. We are used to asking for a 2:00 PM or 3:00 PM checkout and getting refused half the time. The hotel staff gave us an 8:00 PM checkout for free. This made a huge difference as my kids could have a nap, eat a meal, and get showered and changed before our flight home.    Overall we were extremely pleased with our stay. Our family will definitely be staying here next time we are in Waikiki.",Aug 2007,April 2007,Traveled with family,,Prince Rupert

We really liked the entertainment during breakfast (hula dancer and guitarist). Tiki Bar was very convenient and nice.

Every staff member was kind and gracious. Our rooms were cleaned twice a day and were spotless. We loved being just a few steps away from the beach, and many stores and restaurants were also close by. This is the perfect place to stay with a family.

7844162,50,Wonderful place for families,"My family and I spent 5 nights at this place and loved it. We booked it through Pleasant Holidays. While Pleasant Holidays has it rated as a four star, the beds, furniture and linens are probably more in line with a AAA rated 3 star similar to a Double Tree or Embassy Suites.    What the facility lacks in these areas they clearly make up for it in customer service. The front desk goes out of their way to please and the bell boys bend over backwards to assist in what ever your needs are. I dealt with Eddy and Ed almost entirely during the trip and they were wonderful.    The rooms are large with 2 bedrooms, 2 baths, full size kitchen and livingroom with dining area. Each room and the livingroom have TV's with extended cable programming. There are large balconies that face the ocean. They suites are approximately 1200 sq. feet in size. There is a washer and dryer in the hallway closet and all cooking utensils needed plus service pieces for 6. While the furniture was a bit outdated and showed signs of wear, the wear is probably no different than most guests' own homes. The plus to this is that if you are travelling with children you don't have to concern yourself with then bringing in sand or sitting with wet clothes on the couches. The kitchen and baths are also stuck in the 80's but are in excellent working condition.    One downside is the second bedroom only has two twin beds when there is plenty of room to have 2 full size beds. The pull out sofa is queen size and is comfrtable as far as pull outs go. There are only 4, two bedroom suites per floor and the building is about 38 floors. Some of the units have been recently refurbished but I did not get to see any of these. All of the suites face the ocean. I was on the 33rd floor which had a full view of the ocean and Diamond Head. I think that any floor above the 5th floor will have similar views. The views from the 1st to 4th floor will probably be partially blocked by palm trees but you would still be able to see the ocean plus you are closer to the sidewalk and beach if you are a people watcher.    Make sure that you don't confuse the Resortquest Waikiki Beach Towers with the Resortquest Waikiki Beach Hotel which is one block away but only has standard hotel rooms, not 2 bedroom suites.    Another drawback is that the 4 elevators are slow, especially during the check-in and check-out period.    There are plenty of restaurants nearby within walking distance with every choice of food, both high class sit downs and fastfoods. Parking is free at the complex which is a plus for Honolulu because of the lack of parking spaces. There are also trolleys and bus service which will take you to all area tourist attractions. There is a Walmart, Sams Club and a Safeway nearby to stock up on food and supplies, though it might be difficult to carry back to your room if you do not have a car.    While this place is a condo, there is twice daily maid service that cleans, washes dishes, and replace towels and is better than most hotels. The bath products are also first class and have a tropical scent. They do not provide cotton balls or Q-tips though.    This complex is across the street from the beach but is an easy 40 yard walk from your room to the beach. On this section of Waikiki Beach, there are no hotels directly on the beach. This section of the beach also has man made reefs that block the waves so the ocean is calm for the little ones. If it is the large waves you want, they are available a few yards away on either side and beyond the man made reefs.    Waikiki Beach is a busy scene, especially in the evening and late night hours so if you are looking for a more peacefull vacation you might want to try Maui, especially the south end where the Four Seasons, Fairmont and the Grand Wielia are located. I was travelling with 2 teenage daughters so the busier pace of Waikiki was more to their liking.    The Waikiki Beach Towers is not a place for someone looking for a romantic spot as a couple but it is the perfect place for active families. I will defintely stay here again when visiting Waikiki with my family. If you are looking for a more relaxed and romantic place, try the Fairmont on Maui which I stayed at for my anniversery last year where all rooms are suites that consist of a bedroom, livingroom, large bathroom with tub for two, refrigerator, wetbar and microwave.",Jun 2007,June 2007,Traveled with family,,"Riverside, CA"

We were upgraded to a full ocean view 2 bedroom 2 bathroom suite on the 11th floor (I mentioned the Hawaii 5-0 free upgrade option when checking in ) - what a view - we had stayed previously in the partial ocean view suite but this suite was just magnificient. The suite looked as though it had been recently upgraded as there was a granite kitchen benchtop, bathrooms and verandah retiled which were totally different to the partial ocean view suite.  The Bell hops (Russ and his crew) were friendly as always and extremely helpfull when put to the challenge. Free high speed internet access in the suite is handy and when I asked for a longer internet cable a new one was delivered and connected by the building maintenance man within 30minutes - what service!!  The suite has everything U need to live comfortably and has plenty of room to spread out. Car hire is available from all of the major companies nearby and U can park on site for free. I hired a surfboard via the internet which was delivered on site within 1 hour and was able to be stored near the Bell hops in a board rack - a lot cheaper than hiring a board across the road at $10/hr. Would recommend the Cheesecake Factory for a great feed (inhouse/take away) and the usual burger houses are also plentiful and nearby. I would highly recommend this complex for its location, suite size and facilities available within the suite.",May 2007,April 2007,,,"Sydney, Australia"
7418632,40,What a view!!!,"We had a little trouble finding this condo. Driving along the main road in Waikiki there are 3 Resortquest hotels, I think. There was not a sign for where to turn. I called the front desk and they came out to the road to meet us.    We were on the 32nd floor which normally would freak me out but the view was worth it. We had an oceanfront room, I thought with the price difference was well worth it. There is a convenient walkway to the beach. Upon checking in they gave us a pail, shovel and sifter for our kids which was a nice surprise. While these are inexpensive and there is an ABC store right on the corner, it was nice just to have it and go right to the beach.    There are no restaurants to speak of right nearby except McDonald's. Since we arrived late and were starving after our 9 hour flight, we tried to get room service and were told 45 minutes since they get it from another hotel. There are, of course restaurants in all the nearby hotels, but with two tired and hungry kids I really did not want to take them into a hotel.    The room was decent, a little musty smelling maybe from the ocean air. The bed in the master bedroom was hard as a rock and the pillows flat. The a/c in the master controlled both bedrooms but to have it cool enough in the master the other bedroom was like an ice locker(you can open the windows to combat this). Up where we were we did not hear the traffic sounds other than the occasional rescue. The dryer took forever!!! Plan on turning it on at least 3 times for a normal size load.    I would recommend this condo. It's a convenient location, the waterview is amazing.

7407862,40,Just One Night,"We only stayed one night as we came into Oahu a day before our timeshare rental was available. I rented a 2 bedroom oceanfront deluxe room. We were very pleasantly surprised upon check-in when we were informed that we had been upgraded to the Penthouse suite!Though this room was very nice, I could never see paying the $1300/  night it rents for. But what the room lacked, the view more than made  up for. I believe we were on the 42nd floor! Diamondhead to our left,  and the whole expanse of Waikiki Beach in front of us and up the coast to the right. All the staff were extremely helpful. If you tell  them it's your anniversary, they have a little bottle of Korbel waiting in your room. A very nice stay, very clean but not as fancy as you might expect for the price. I guess I expected what the website picture showed as the room and it is not that updated. It appears they are working on certain rooms to update them though.",Apr 2007,March 2007,Traveled with family,,"San Diego, California"
7347803,40,"Solid, spacious condos w/ good amenities; not really 'luxurious,' though","We stayed here for 9-days w/ kids & senior parents.

Positives:    (1) Enormous living space  (2) Excellent ocean views  (3) Good-sized lanai  (4) Free wired internet  (5) Free, friendly valet  (6) Washer/dryer in unit  (7) 2x daily maid service  (8) ""Bridged"" twin beds convert to king  (9) Kid-friendly pool (3' to 5' deep)  (10) Good coupon book on arrival for Polynesian Cult.

Tile (not granite) counters; old cabinetry; popcorn ceilings.  (2) Limited common area/lobby  (3) Not in the same class Ritz, Four Seasons, or even a high-end Marriott or Hyatt.  (4) 1 bad service experience. Check-in person rudely responded, ""Where do you get these ideas?"" when asked if he could bridge the twin beds. Of course, housekeeping bridged beds following day.

7347120,40,Great place for families,"My husband and I stayed at the Resortquest Waikiki Tower with my parents and brother last summer. The location is pefect. Right across  the street from Waikiki Beach. The whole area is grossly commercialized and touristy but it is convenient. Close to everything  ..restaurants, grocery stores, shopping, etc. We stayed in a 2 bedroom with partial ocean view. The view from our patio was fantastic. The rooms are nothing fancy and some of the furniture and fixtures are older and could use some sprucing up but overall, the condo is very well maintained and clean. My husband and I have stayed  at the Princeville Resort in Kauai and Grand Wailea in Maui so we like luxury, but this place was very do-able for us since we had 3 extra family members staying with us. At about $2500 for 6 nights, much more economical than staying at a resort. The staff is very helpful and friendly, especially the bell boys..always smiling and eager to help. If you're looking for luxury, this is definitely not the place but if you're with kids or a larger family, this place is perfect and I would highly recommend it.",Apr 2007,August 2006,Traveled with family,,"Orange COunty, CA"
7171278,50,Great Location!,"We just returned from a trip to Waikiki and Maui - we spent six nights on each island.    We enjoyed our stay at ResortQuest very much. The location was fantastic - close to the action, but kind of at the end of it all (not as noisy and busy). We were right across the street from the beach, but also enjoyed bus service to the hotel. We had oceanview rooms, the view was incredible.    We enjoyed Tiki's Restaurant very much. Great food and entertainment. The included breakfast was also great for us - there's great choices and the convenience was incredible. There was also entertainment every morning at breakfast, which was really enjoyable.    Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone travelling!",Mar 2007,March 2007,Traveled with family,,"Edmonton, Alberta"
6907201,40,An Excellent choice for families,"We just completed a 6 night stay at this hotel. We were a group of six with 3 adults and 3 young children. This hotel was an excellent choice for our family. The location is excellent and easy walking distance to most activities in Honolulu that would interest a family with young children, including the aquarium, the zoo, the beach which is right across the street, plus most activities on the main strip. The units are very large with 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a large living room, a full dining room, and a full kitchen. It easily accommodated our family. There is also quite a bit of closet space which let us fully unpack. Even with 6 people, we never felt crowded and with 3 televisions there was no fighting and everyone could do their own thing.    We had booked a partial ocean view room, but were upgraded to a full ocean view on arrival (thank you to the hotel staff). The view from the lanai, which was also very large, was amazing. A sweeping view of the ocean, plus a great view of Diamond Head to boot. The only annoyance was some noise that came from an air conditioning unit on an adjacent property, but it was not horrible just a constant hum and you could only hear this from the lanai.    The staff at this hotel is extremely friendly and helpful and the doormen always greet you with a smile. They were happy to assist or offer advise with anything we needed. The hotel provides fresh towels for the beach, and also beach chairs, mats, umbrellas, inflatable rafts, and sand toys.You just pick these up in the lobby and walk across the street to the beach. When you come back, you just drop them off in the lobby as well, so no wet towels or sandy beach toys in the room. The beach across the street from the hotel is excellent for children as it has a breakwater wall that cuts down the waves. Most other beachs in Wakiki would be difficult for young children or poor swimmers to use because of the rough surf. Free valet parking and free internet access (wired and pretty fast) was also a plus.    The lobby was a little dated, and the furniture in the room, was a little worn, but none of this was too bad and everything was very clean. With young children, we don't mind some furntiure with a few dings in it as it makes us less nervous. All of the hotels in Wakiki take a beating because they are right on the beach and people are constantly dragging sand and wet shoes through them. The hotel is currently doing renovations (but we never heard any noise from this) and I understand that the lobby and all of the rooms will be redone shortly.    Having use of a full kitchen was great. Its much easier with a large group to have everyone eat breakfast on their own schedule then trying to get everyone up and out. We also saved a lot of money as breakfast is expensive in Honolulu.  The kitchen had everything you would need, including an icemaker in the refrigerator door. There are no restaurants or bars in the hotel, as its setup more like an apartment building then a hotel but that is really not an issue. You are surrounded by restaurants and hotel bars all within easy walking distance. We went to The Cheesecake Factory, California Pizza Kitchen, Oceanarium, the Shorebird Broiler, and Cheeseburger in Paradise. All good choices for young children.    On the whole I thought this was a very good value and was a better option that renting two smaller rooms at another hotel.",Mar 2007,February 2007,Traveled with family,,New York
6650507,10,"Absolutely Horrible, Dont Bother","We stayed here in April 2006 on our honeymoon. The staff was rude at the first encounter. We got off a long, arduous flight and were exhausted, then find out our room wasn't ready. Their attitude was, oh well, too bad. Our room was cramped, the walls looked like they had water damage, the sliding glass door wouldn't close properly, so we had to keep it open all night, thus having to endure the noise from the street, the bar downstairs, etc. The furnishings were cheap and sparse and for the money we spent (around $2000) it was not worth it. The elevators didn't work properly, Sometimes there were spills on the tile floors that went unattended. The ""free"" breakfast was horrible -- I've had better food at McDonalds. On the 3rd day, we were on our way back to our room when some guy in front of us was checking all the doors to see which one he could get into. He was extremely intoxicated and started harrasing my husband. Under no circumstances would I ever recommend this hotel to anyone, including my worst enemies. It pretty much ruined our honeymoon.",Jan 2007,January 2007,Traveled as a couple,,San Diego

The valets Eddie and Russ were all smiles and had great attitudes.We were greeted warmly every time we walked by.  At check in we were informed we had been upgraded to a 2 bedroom penthouse suite instead of the 2 bedrrom deluxe oceanfront because of some construction some in the building. the views of Diamondhead and the ocean were amazing .The twice daily maid service was a little more than we were used to but the fresh linens and loaded dishwasher everyday was great.

6628704,50,Very Nice,"My wife and I recently returned from a five day visit to Oahu and a seven day NCL cruise to the islands of Kauai, Hawaii and Maui. We saw many spectacular sights and enjoyed our visit. I can add little to reviews by other Trip Advisor travelers on Hawaii’s natural beauty, Honolulu’s shopping opportunities or the high cost of goods and services in Hawaii. However, I agree with those that say Hawaii is a “must do”.    I am an avid Trip Advisor reader and always look forward to user reviews and recommendations as part of any vacation planning. This trip was no exception.    Our itinerary included two days before the cruise and three days after the cruise in Honolulu so selecting superior but good value lodging on or near Waikiki Beach was a priority. We were traveling with another couple so we could add condos to the list of properties we would consider.    One of Trip Advisor’s higher rated properties is the ResortQuest Waikiki Beach Tower (the condo, not their similarly named hotel three blocks nearer Diamond Head). I am pleased to add my recommendation for this property to others you can read on Trip Advisor.    The Waikiki Beach Tower is an attractive and exceptionally well managed property. While it looks like a 1980’s property it has been carefully refurbished and is exceptionally clean and well maintained. In addition to the well furnished rooms there is a pool, hot tub and saunas. The front office staff is gracious and helpful. There is an abundance of service staff (from bellmen to maids) and any request we had to the desk was satisfied within fifteen minutes.    The property has numerous floor plans and views. We inspected two superior rooms before making our selection. One, a partially obstructed view, room on the seventeenth floor and one with an expansive ocean/beach view on the twentieth floor. We took the one with the best view.    One item that was not clear to me from my review of this property was the condo’s lay-out. I missed (or it was not covered) that the condo is furnished with a king bed in the master bedroom and two twin beds in the 2d bedroom. The twin beds did not meet our requirements. The desk quickly “bridged” the beds and relocated the night tables in the 2d bedroom. The couple that stayed there said it was comfortable and one could not tell that it was meant to look that way.    The cost of our stay at the Waikiki Beach Tower was 1322 USD ($220.00 per night per couple). There are flashier lodgings on Waikiki Beach. However, I consider the Waikiki Beach Tower to be a bargain for a clean, well run Waikiki Beach-front hotel with a gorgeous view. I highly recommend this property.",Jan 2007,January 2007,,,"Comanche, Texas"
6122252,50,This place rocks,"My wife and I stayed here for our 10th anniversary and were very impressed. First since my wife deals with severe allergies to cleaning products and the like I contacted the hotel via e-mail to ask if it would be possible that only allegy friendly cleaning products could be used. We received a response via e-mail within a day advising they understood. A couple days later we received a e-mail from the hotel manager advising they would be happy to fulfill the request and if we had any recommendations for types of products to use. When we arrived we were greeted by a very friendly valet and front desk staff. During our 7 day stay, the staff were extremely nice and friendly and our room impeccable. There is a nightly turn down service and we would return to our room to find the bed turned down and a bagged goody placed on the pillows. Eventhough the hotel does not have an in hotel dining room that didn't slow these folks down a bit. They have an agreement to get thier meals delivered by the I think Sheraton, one block down, and we placed an order and had our food delivered in 40 minutes and still HOT!! Newspapers delivered and set outside your room each morning and caring staff who actually called my wife twice to check to see if everything was up to standards and if anything else was needed. During checkout the staff were very nice and even gave me paper towels and bottle of water(my head was sweating since I shave it daily). Also have to say that I found the concierge inserts in the newspaper everyday fun to read. This hotel has by far been the best that my wife and I have every stayed at. They were professional, the room cleaned immaculately and the view from our oceanview room amazing. These folks rock.",Nov 2006,November 2006,Traveled as a couple,,Sitka Alaska

The location of the building is great, right on the north side of the main strip across the street from the beach. The staff could not have been better and made the stay very pleasant by giving advice on places to see and beaches to go to away from the regular tourist areas. Parking is free with a valet and the bell service is top notch.

6034329,50,What a delight. A perfect experience.,"After quite a bit of research online, I selected this property for my husband's and my first trip to Hawaii. We don't have kids and we're 39 and 49 yrs old (he's the older one). We were hesitant to stay in Waikiki partly because we are sick to death of construction (we live in Orange County and there's always something going on construction-wise), and partly because we thought we'd like to be in a more natural setting.    Well. We selected this property nonetheless, and we haven't had a bit of regret. We stayed there from October 21 thru the 27th and booked the whole shebang thru Aloha Airlines Vacations. I always panic that when you book indirectly, something will get mixed up. But the whole trip went smoothly like buttah. And this includes when we pulled up to the RQ Waikiki Beach Tower. Bellman Ed and another guy whose name I forget actually anticipated our arrival and guessed our names as we got out of our car. Nice. Immediately alleviated our fears that our reservation would be screwed up.    Our room was ginormous. We had a 1 BR condo unit on the 9th floor. As others have said, the view is stunning. You don't believe the ocean is really that color til you're staring at it. The lanai was huge, stretching the width of the unit, prolly 25 ft or more.    The full kitchen was awesome. There was silver service and dishes for 6 people. Plenty of glasses and mugs of various sizes. A knife block with a big carving knife and one small paring knife. Salt and pepper. A sauce pan, a frying pan, some glass bakeware, a measuring cup. Coffee maker, rice maker, toaster, blender. We found the kitchen more than adequate. There is a dishwasher and soap provided daily. The housekeepers ran the dishwasher for us incl putting our dishes from the sink to the dishwasher. We cooked a couple times for dinner and ate in for all breakfasts. Lunch most days was sandwiches and fruit we made in the kitchen and took with us.    Then there's a great big living room area and a dining area too. The sofa in the living room is a pull-out. It was, sadly, uncomfortable in both those capacities but that's a small thing compared to all the things this place gets right. TV and DVD player in the living room. Desk with internet hookup dealie.    Master bedroom is not huge but absolutely serviceable. TV in there too. Master bath has two sinks, medicine cabinet, tub/shower, and this is where the washer/dryer are located. We used it four times during our trip (they are ""mini"" units but still a great perk).    It is true that the carpet is old, and the whole place needs a paint job. But it was absolutely clean and the service provided by everyone who works here more than makes up for the cosmetic issues.    There's a small pool (hardly saw anyone using it during our stay but it looked nice and clean) and a jacuzzi, both on a fourth-floor deck.    There are no restaurants in the hotel but two steps one direction or another, and you're falling over restaurants outside the hotel. Plus there are THREE ABC stores on the same block as this property.    The bellmen, both Ed and Eddy as well as the others, could not be more friendly and unsnobby. They allow you to basically help yourself to the supply closet where the beach stuff is. We borrowed floatie rafts, beach mats, beach towels, coolers, beach chairs, and a beach umbrella. They didn't even make you sign them out or anything -- just ""here you go, knock yourself out and take what you want"". Very very convenient and just nice that they trust you.    It is on the pricey side, this property, but man oh man, what an amazing experience. I'll include pics of the beach right in front of the hotel, as well as a sunset from the lanai.",Oct 2006,October 2006,Traveled as a couple,,"Littleton, Colorado"

Let me start by saying what a great time we had and how nice it was to stay somewhere so friendly and laid back right in the heart of Waikiki.  We had a 2 bedroom/2 bath oceanfront condo on the 30th floor which was great. The room was clean and well furnished with everything you need for a great vacation from dishes in the kitchen to extra towels stocked for the beach. The view from the room was also absolutely breathtaking.  Even tough you are right in the hustle and bustle of Waikiki the hotel is quiet and peaceful and you feel like you are the only person there.  The staff is friendly and extremly helpful always there if you have a question or just for a nice ""Aloha"".  This was my second time in Hawaii.

Not much of a pool.    85% japanese occupants. Sometimes difficulty in communicating. Felt like I was in a foreign country.    No amenities on-site (food, bar, stores, gym. etc.)    Disappointing.

Knives, forkes etc. and other kitchen necessites were very limited.    The unit was very large. The location of the resort is perfect. We walked to the beach in front which was wonderful. Calm enough to float about. Surfers were beyond the small wall.    We ate at the Cheescake Factory (great breaded shrimp) and Chilli's and saw the Society of Seven Show at the Outrigger (we walked).

5296705,50,The Best 05/27 - 06/02,"6 nights from May 27 to June 2nd    We booked this trip one month in advance, so it was kind of a last minute trip. We are a family of 4 so, i was looking for at least a one bedroom suite that was close to the beach. And of course everything was sold out (well all the rooms at the Waikiki Beach Towers). When i read about the rooms at Waikiki Beach Towers I knew that's where i wanted to stay. So, I narrowed my choices down to the Waikiki Sunset, and the Waikiki Banyan. There where some negative reviews about the Banyan and the Sunset but some good reviews also, so I had a hard time making my decision. My main concern was the distance from the beach. Once i got there I saw that the 2 and 3 blocks that people talked about from the beach and whatever you wanted to do. Was not really that far away. The Banyan and the Sunset are just around the block from the Waikik Beach Towers. And if you are looking at a hotel map, (like i did before going) things look farther away than they actually are. We rented a car for the 6 days that we where there, but never drove to any location in Waikiki. We traveled to other parts of the island in the car. Anyway, my point is: if location is what you are looking for and you want a suite. Don't think that the Banyan and Sunset are too far from the beach because they are not. We paid about $1000.00 more to stay at the Waikiki Beach Towers than we would have paid to stay at the Sunset or Banyan. I don't know how the rooms are at Banyan or Sunset but the location is fine.  Ok, anyway. After searching the web I found a site that still had a couple of rooms at the Waikiki Beach Towers. (greathawaiivacations) We paid for at 2 bedroom partial ocean view. When we arrived they upgraded us to a 2 bedroom deluxe oceanview room. We where on the 31st floor, both bedrooms and the living room had at TV (living room had the dvd player). The kitchen had all the dishes and everything that you would need. Frig had ice and water dispenser. Free Internet in the livingroom, just plug the cord in and you are connected (no wireless internet, but it's dsl). Washer and dryer(and they provide detergent), microwave, iron and board, robes, beach towles, nightly turn down service( if that's something you need), free valet parking, and you can walk right out the door and across the street to the beach. This place is within walking distance to everything in Waikiki. There is a mcdonalds and an Asain resturant just downstairs. You can't go wrong by staying here. And if you come across a negative review. They must be Rulers of some other country, because this place spoils you.",Jun 2006,,,,Los Angeles

This was my mother's first trip to the islands so we wanted to make it special. The staff were very accomadating of our few specail requests. Our room wasn't quite ready by three but they gave us a bottle of champange, Godiva chocolates and a $100 in-room dining credit so we didn't mind the delay, just went next door for a snack until it was ready! Every staff member we encountered was friendly and willing to help with anything we needed. We had a two bedroom partial ocean view on the 17th floor. It was certainly better than most ""partial ocean-view"" rooms! We watched the surfers and swimmers every morning as we enjoyed our coffe on the lanai. The condo was a little dated and needed a few repairs but the beds were comfotable and everything worked so that was minor.

5148281,40,"Excellent Condo,Great Service!!Loved it!! We'll be back!!","We stayed here for 15 days, from April 27 - May 12 for our 10th anniversary and had a great stay! I read some of the negative reviews, and could not understand where they could have come from. I found a good package deal with Great Hawaii Vacations, and we got a 2 Bedroom since we were sharing with another couple. Splitting the cost, it cost the same or even less than hotels in the same location, and this is a condo-resort, with a full kitchen, 2 Large bathrooms and a huge lanai with a fantastic ocean view!(The only negative for me was that the bed was not very comfortable and the toaster was broken. I'm sure if I had complained, they would have tried to help the situation, but my stiff neck got better as the day went on and the toaster wasn't all important, so I didn't say anything. Maybe they could invest in some mattress toppers to soften the beds...)By the way, it was called a partial ocean view, but even that was great because you're so close!! Oh and I forgot, most importantly, daily maid and turn down service, free valet parking (which is important in Waikiki!), and a superb ""Aloha Spirit"" amongst the whole staff, especially the valets--- you guys were great, and the maintenance man, Eddie, who fixed our sliding door for us! I almost forgot the washer/dryer in the condo with free detergent, so you can wash all you want-- also free coffee each day. The front desk staff/concierge would bend over backwards to help you with whatever you need, from tours and activities to restaurants and more. They sent us a sweet anniversary card with Godiva Chocolates and a bottle of sparkling cider for our anniversary -- thanks so much, for helping to make it special. The pool and hot tub/jacuzzi were kept extremely clean and were fairly quiet, compared with other places we've stayed. They also had a sauna and a pool table, but we were too busy going to the beach, right across the street!! Also, one of the best restaurants we found, the Oceanarium, was right next door at the Pacific Beach Hotel. The buffet was $33.95, but the food was awesome and you get to look at the sea life in the oceanarium tanks while you eat! Try it at least once if you come here. There are plenty of other restaurants very nearby, so not having one in the building is no big deal, and probably makes for a much quieter place to stay. I know we never had any problems with noise or anything and they were renovating 6 or 7 of the condos at the time. This is probably why someone said the decor in the condo could use updating, because that one hadn't been renovated yet. Well, I could go on and on, but you just need to experience it for yourself. True it is a bit pricey, but share the cost of a 2 bdrm with someone and it's better-- plus the service and cleanliness, etc. is really worth it. So, thanks to all of you at the Waikiki Beach Tower!! You all deserve a raise. I felt totally pampered. ALOHA!! : )",May 2006,May 2006,,,"Honolulu, Hawaii"
5077095,40,Great for a family of 5,"We recently returned from our Hawaiian vacation and had a very nice stay at the Resortquest Waikiki Beach Tower. We are a family of 5 (kids 12, 10, 8) and usually have difficultly finding accommodations that easily fit all 5 of us without getting 2 rooms. Since this is a condo style property and not a hotel it fit us great. Our condo was a partial ocean view which afforded a better than expected view of Waikiki Beach. The unit was a little dated but clean and comfortable. Ours was a 2 bedroom, 2 bath unit with kitchen ,and with daily maid service, it was the best of both worlds. We never experienced slow elevator service. The bellmen were very attentive and helpful with recommendations for great local restuarants (check out Me BBQ for Korean BBQ right around the corner). The Beach Tower offers nice big beach towels, chairs, and bamboo mats for FREE rental. There are even some boogie boards that they let you use...for FREE.  As far as location, this property is located in the heart of Waikiki. zoo (5-10 minute drive). It is close to Diamond Head and the Its street entrance is well hidden with easy around the corner drive in lobby. Finding this place was a little tricky.  The beach in front is great. It offers the waves of Waikiki and the protected breakwater of Prince Kuhio Beach. There are surf lessons and outrigger canoe rides right on the beach. The canoe rides were $15 per person for 3 waves, about 20 minutes worth of paddling. There are photographers on the beach to digitally record your voyage. The photos are burned to CD ($15 for 1 photo, $30 for all photos of you).  This place was ""da kine,"" and I would stay here again!",May 2006,April 2006,,,"Hartland, WI"
5038556,20,So it's big.....BIG DEAL!!!,"I just recently stayed at this location and must say I was very unimpressed (Especially based on the reviews here). Yes, it's a big room but unless you're with a family, who needs it? I was in Oahu with my wife and thought to myself as I entered the room that if I wanted a condo, I could have easily gone to a few websites and found one for considerably less than what I paid for this place ($400+). The furniture is old and there aren't many services to speak of. I've stayed outside the main strip before (Ko Olina) and found the rooms away from Waikiki are quite spacious but not outrageous like this place. If you're with a family, this is a good choice, but if it's just you and a spouse or partner, I'd suggest someplace that offers the services of a regular hotel (room service, bar service, etc.). It's much more fun to be pampered when you're on vacation.",May 2006,May 2006,,,"San Mateo, CA"
4972374,40,Excellent Location and Service,"The hotel is in a great location and is just a few steps from the beach. You can walk to anywhere in Waikiki from the Hotel and feel safe. The service at the hotel is first rate. The staff are helpful and give great recommendations for restaurants and are just good natured about everything. This is what separates this hotel from the rest.    The hotel room is above average, but has a nice balcony. The kitchen is nice to have. The bathrooms could be larger, but we felt very comfortable in the spacious room.",Apr 2006,March 2006,,,Chicago
4954860,40,memories for a lifetime!,"We had a wonderful vacation here at the Resort Quest Waikiki Beach Tower Condos (March 31 - April 9). The weather was great after having 41 days of rain. We had a couple of days that rained only a few minutes and then the sun came out. The staff was awesome and very friendly(especially the valet guys :) ) You were greeted every time with a big smile and a big ALOHA! They made you feel very welcomed. Our room had a spectular view of the ocean and Diamond Head. The bedrooms was nice. There is also a washer/dryer in this condo so pack light. There are no restaurants or bars in this resort but you can walk to many of them right down the street.    We did many touristy activities but the most memorable one was our Shark Encounters Tour. It was incredible and highly recommended for pictures of a lifetime. It was the top attraction for my whole family. Captain Jimmy was awesome! Some other recommendations or musts are:    Shark Encounters  Blowhole  Haumema Bay for snorkeling  Polyesian Culture Center  Diamond Head  Pearl Harbor  Makaha Beach  Parasailing  Try all the beaches besides Waikiki Beach    We saw an Elephant Seal on one of the beaches sunning itself. We also saw a whale while parasailing.    As for restaurants we went to Cheesecake Factory, Tikis, SeaSide,and Dukes.  Thank you Resort Quest Waikiki Beach Tower. We had a great time.",Apr 2006,April 2006,,,"Michiana Shores, Indiana"
4827906,20,A bit overated,"I'm a little surprised by such high praise of this hotel. I would probably give it a 4 star if it was similar in price to the other hotels on the Waikiki strip, but it isn't. With that in mind it needs to be compared with a higher quality hotel such as the Halekulani (or at least something in that ballpark). When it's put side by side like that, it really isn't a good buy for you money. Most of the reveiws just keep raving about location, but seriously...how big is this island? My normal commute to work is about 45 minutes so I don't mind going a little further out for better value. Afterall, I don't typically run back and forth to a hotel if I'm spending time in Waikiki (don't know many people who do). We spent some of time on the other side of the island and Turtle Bay resort was far superior to this one and at about 1/2 the price (you just have to deal with driving if you want to go to Waikiki...but it's much more relaxing than being in the city). Anyway for my money, I'll try someplace else.",Apr 2006,March 2006,,,"San Francisco, CA"
4824837,50,Absolutely no regrets...the perfect choice for us!,"We (family of four with 2 kids ages 6 and 4) stayed here two weeks. It was the perfect choice for us - the unit was large, the view was amazing, and the service was great. We had an ocean front room so we could see the beach from both the living area and the master bedroom.    It was great to be ""in the middle of everything"". Kuhio Beach, a calmer area (breakers for the surf) for kids, is just across the street. Just stroll outside to plenty of restaurants, shops and of course the beach. The hotel provided towels, and beach mats, plus inflatable toys for the kids. It was so nice to not have to slug all that stuff for 3 blocks; it's amazing how much stuff you bring to the beach! And when we got caught in some downpours, we just walked across the street to our room, waited it out, and went back.    I know some have complained about the pool, but we loved it! It was perfect - there was hardly anyone ever there. Always a lounge chair available, the kids could play freely, and the hot tub was HOT! I personally don't care for the ""nicer"" pool areas in hotels when it means you can never find a spot and the pool is jam packed.    Be wary of the negative reviews...most of them are for the RQ Waikiki Beach Hotel, not the Tower. I will say that the rooms are in need of an upgrade (fresh paint and carpets, and the cupboards were outdated), but that was going on while we were there.    I would post pics, but they would be the same as those aleady posted.    All in all, I highly recommend this place. For families it can't be beat!!    Mel",Mar 2006,March 2006,,,Vancouver
4772612,50,Nice place to stay,We stayed at the Resort Quest Waikiki Beach Tower in March and we loved it. The view of Waikiki Beach is incredible and the staff is very helpful and friendly. Don't pay attention to the bad reviews-they're from people who are confusing the name of this place with the hotel. The condos are large and clean and the location is great.,Mar 2006,March 2006,,,"Monroe, CT"
4607166,40,Had a great time!,"I have to laugh at some of the reviews that comment on the Waikiki Beach Towers lobby.......who cares! It was a small, clean lobby but that isn't what makes a vacation. The staff at the Beach Towers is what made the stay so pleasant. They were so friendly and helpful. They made us feel very welcome and made us feel that they were glad we were there! We could count on our room being ""tidied"" up every day while we were out and the turn down sevice every evening was such a nice touch.....your bed is ready to climb in and they leave a little treat on the pillow. We could walk to so many places from here and when we went to Pearl Harbor and the Polynesian Cultural Center we were within walking distance of our pick-up location. Otherwise, you can hop on the city bus to get anywhere else. Yes, the furniture is a little outdated but that didn't bother us. There were 3 couples celebrating our anniversaies and we certainly enjoyed ourselves....again, the staff was what made each day one to smile about. We stayed at another ResortQuest in Maui and they couldn't compare with Waikiki Beach Towers.",Mar 2006,,,,"Delphos, OH"
4602620,50,"Great experience, lots of space",We just returned from a 6 night stay at the Beach Tower and had a wonderful time. Although it is true that the condos are somewhat dated they are in the process of renovating. The rooms were extremely clean and service was great. As far as the pool and hot tub area go-they are clean but stark-The size of the units and the location far outweigh the absence of an upgraded pool area. We actually spent far more time in the condo than we normally would in a hotel room because it was so comfortable. Being able to prepare breakfast and make our own cocktails saved an enormous amount of money. Having a washer and dryer was great too. It was a nice combination of having a large quite unit to retreat to and being just steps from the action of Waikiki and its beaches. This was truly one of our best stays in Waikiki and we would stay here again (unless of course it becomes cost prohibitive after the renovations.),Mar 2006,March 2006,,,"anchorage, alaska"
4581340,10,Don't stay at the ResortQuest Waikiki Beach Tower,"When we arrived, even though we had prepaid, they said they were overbooked and did not have a room. They sent us to another hotel, which was really a pain because we had already unloaded all of our stuff, our children etc. The staff was INCREDIBLY unhelpful and rude. The check in time was supposed to be 3:00 but they said that is the ""earliest"" check in time, and we would actually not be able to check in until much later. The location is good, but the place is also a dump with bad service. Other people were at the front desk complaining at the same time. I think this seems more like a 2 star hotel. Be wary, and DON'T prepay because you will be stuck.",Mar 2006,February 2006,Traveled on business,,"Carlsbad, California"
4366577,30,Top Rated Condo in Waikiki is Overrated,"I don't know about the 1-bedrooms, but the 2-bedrooms are definitely a rip-off in this place. We are seasoned vacationers with a 4 and 5-yr old. We strive to get a good value whether we are staying a in 3-star or 4-star property. We read the glowing reviews of this place and got an Entertainment rate for 50% off the rack rate of a premium ocean view 2-bedroom unit. (The rack rate at the time of this review is $776! - not much inventory in Waikiki with 2 bedrooms) So we decided to splurge this year.    We are familiar with many Waikiki properties and realize most were built in the 70's so many have rooms that still have that 70's dated feel. The Beach Tower is no exception although there was renovation beginning in the lower floor units when we checked in. Right away we were extremely surprised with the almost Motel-6 like check-in area. Tiny and a bit of a dingy/worn feeling. But it's just the check-in area, big deal I thought, but surprising. We had a corner unit on the 32nd floor (I think that was in the top 3 floors). Unit was definitely 70's. Worn carpets, dark ugly woods, dated kitchen, etc. Gorgeous view of the ocean and Waikiki (and the side of the building for the middle two units that stick out farther.) At $388 a night, this was unacceptable so they moved us to a center unit which had a better 180 degree view and the master was on the view side instead of the kitchen being on the view side of the unit. Problem is, you really have to sit out on the lanai to really enjoy it (the overhang of the lanai above you is very low), or better yet hang over the railing to get the full 180 degrees from Diamond Head all the way around. All the corner units did not appear to have large windows around the corner on the other side of the building so your view from the living room is pretty narrowly focused.    I initially decided to 'surrender' and spend the next 6 days paying out the nose for a mediocre 2-bedroom condo but then I took the kids down to the pool and saw the worst pool area I've seen in a long time. The pool area is tiny and not enough seating area. My wife and I would have had a hard time finding a place to sit to watch our kids swim. The sunning area is a separate area down the stairs. It is large with plenty of room but you can't sit their and keep and eye on your kids at the pool. The pool area is very plain/ugly - nothing special AT ALL. There's also a very closed in claustrophobic feel to the pool area because of the sides of the building so close by. Unacceptable. (No tennis court to boot.)    So we abandoned the place and moved to the dumpier Waikiki Banyan two blocks down and 1 block in for $130/night for a 1 bedroom with a partial Ocean View on the 36th floor and a much better pool area with tennis court, putting green, playground, two hot tubs, and barbecue area. We stayed there last year so we knew what we'd be getting for our money. At 1/3 the price of the 2-bedroom at the Beach Tower, it is a MUCH better value - definitely a step down from the Beach Tower though (except for the pool area). I realize your paying for the view and location of the Beach Tower and it IS Waikiki, but lack of renovated rooms, and 2-star pool area do not justify the high prices they are charging. I'm not going to pay close to $400/night for a place that isn't worth over $300/night - about $275/night max in my estimation considering the pool area.    One thing I did notice when riding the elevators (which could take 5-10 minutes to arrive, especially after 4:30 when they shut one down to let housekeeping do the turn down service.) is the majority of the guests were from Japan where I believe they are used to paying higher prices for things. If you're more concerned with location over value and want a spacious 1-bedroom or 2-bedroom condo in the heart with an unobstructed oceanfront view and don't care much about the pool and recreation facilities, you will be happy with this place (as most other reviewers were). If you have experience vacationing a lot, staying at many different places in different levels of luxury (especially with children) and are very value conscious (even if you can afford $500/night) you will be very disappointed with the value factor of the property (as you will with many Waikiki properties - but there ARE good values out there.)",Jan 2006,November 2005,,,"Seattle, Washington"
4365980,40,Great Condo - Some reviews for wrong hotel,"Many of the reviews in this section are for the wrong hotel. The Waikiki Beach Tower is across the street from Waikiki beach where they rent all of the surf boards, etc. Some reviews that I'm reading appear to actually be for the similarily named hotel, the ResortQuest Waikiki Beach HOTEL(not Beach TOWER.)    One of the main differences between these two facilities is that the Beach Tower is an all condo high rise. It does not have any restaurants. Any reviews mentioning breakfast buffets, etc. are actually for the Beach Hotel, not the Beach Tower.    Now that we have that straightened out... the Beach Tower is a very nice facility. The location cannot be beat. It is directly across the street from the most happening area of Waikiki Beach. In fact, we could see free the nightly luau on the beach right from our balcony.    We registered for a partial ocean view 2 bedroom 2 bath condo on Orbitz. When we arrived we received a free upgrade to a full ocean view room. From the 15th floor, the ocean view was fantastic. Although there are actually about 30 floors in the facility. There are only 4 rooms per floor, I think that all have at least a partial ocean view or a view of Diamond Head.    The balcony ran the length of our bedroom and living room, so it was quite large and nice to sit on.    When we arrived to our room we received a free 1/2 sized bottle of champagne and a box of Godiva chocolates. What a nice touch. We didn't pay extra for this or ask for it. In addition, each night we received a turn-down service with a different ""treat"".    The kitchen is fully stocked with all the dishes you will need. We had six people in our condo (two on the pull out sleeper in the living room - which wasn't too comfortable.) But the unit was accomodating for the six adults we had.    As most reviews mention, the service at this facility is fantastic. All the bellmen are extremely friendly and nice. Everyone smiles and greets you very pleasantly. They will give you fresh towels for the beach everyday at the bell station and take your dirty ones when you return. There is also a shower in the walkway up to the hotel to wash off your sand, etc.    As I noted earlier, there are no restaurants (or room service) in this facility. But that didn't bother us. We bought a bunch of groceries our first day and we went out for dinner quite a bit too. If you have a car, there is a Costco about a 15 minute drive from the hotel. A much better deal for buying groceries than any of the local places by the beach. We also really enjoyed the ""pu pu"" menu at the Outrigger Hula Grill just across the street and to the right. From 4-6 they have a happy hour with great deals on sandwiches, appetizers, a great fish fry and drinks. They have $3.50 Mai Tais that are the best on the island. Tiki head glass and all.    The furniture in the place looks like the photos on this site, but the photos were probably taken quite a few years ago. Our furniture seemed a little run down and the wood paneling on some of the cabinetry seemed like it was from the 70s. But my party all agreed that we would sacrifice the ""high style"" room for a room with a lot of space and a great location.    Many hotels in Waikiki charge upwards of $15.00/night for parking. This hotel has free nightly parking. This was a great deal since we rented a car for the entire week that we were in Waikiki.    If you're looking for a room with a great location and a lot of space for your group, this is the best place to stay on Waikiki beach. Aloha!",Jan 2006,January 2006,,,"Milwaukee, WI"
4364845,40,"Location, location, location...","My family (my husband, father, 21 yr. old daughter, 18 yr. old son & I) stayed at the Waikiki Beach Tower from 1/3-1/10/06. Our accommodations included: ocean front view, 2 bedrooms, 2 full baths, a full kitchen and a washer/dryer. Positives: 1) the hotel is in a GREAT LOCATION, overlooking Waikiki Beach and Kalakaua Ave. It allowed for easy walking to many restaurants, shopping, the beach & surfing. 2) The staff at the Waikiki Beach Tower are outstanding, especially Eddy & Gregg of the Valet Service. All the staff were friendly, helpful and easily offered driving directions or suggestions on restaurants and golf courses. 3) Our rooms were very spacious!! When traveling with 5 people whose ages range from 18 – 74, it’s helpful to have space to get away from each other occasionally. Between the 2 bedrooms, the huge balcony and the living room there was always plenty of space. 4) There were 3 TV’s, one in each bedroom and one in the living room. 5) The kitchen was well equipped with everything from a dishwasher, coffee maker, toaster, rice cooker, flatware, chopsticks, pots/pans, wine glasses, etc. 6)There was a great deal of storage space i.e. walk-in closet in the master bedroom, a closet and a cupboard in the second bedroom, a linen closet and decorative cupboards in the living room area. 7) There were several chaise lounges, a pool table, tables/chairs around the pool, hot tub and sundeck area. The locker rooms were clean, as were the showers and sauna’s. Negatives: 1) Everything is a little “worn”. The hotel would benefit from fresh paint, new carpets, and newer furniture. The hotel is undergoing some renovations but I never felt inconvenienced by it or heard any noise from it. 2) There are a few hotels in the area with very similar names making this hotel difficult for us to locate initially and for the rental car company to deliver our van to us.    Overall, my family felt that the positives greatly outweighed any negatives. I showed them Hilton Hawaiian Village and asked if they would have preferred staying there (it’s at the other end of the beach). Everyone agreed that the Waikiki Beach Tower’s proximity to restaurants and shopping was much better than the Hilton and preferred our “condo-hotel” accommodations to the typical hotel room we would have had at the Hilton.",Jan 2006,January 2006,,,"Camillus, NY"
4332969,50,Great spot and a fantastic Hotel,"We were here in December 2005. A quick check in and they gave us a room with three beds (for our two children) and a nice mountain view with sea-glimpses on the 22nd floor.    The pool deck has a great breakfast till 9.30. So my son and I would go surfing across the road and then come back to have a family breakfast overlooking Waikiki Beach.    Close to everything with plenty of shopping close by and the trolley to Moana Shopping Centre stops out the front.

4025903,40,pretty good for what/where it was,"just came back from 6 days in waikiki- and had a great time. i've never written a report here, but after this trip felt compelled to do so- There are good things and bad things- but i think overall the good outways the bad. First the good- we stayed on the top floor, and had a decent view of waikiki beach- every morning they have breakfast, in the front area by the pool- which is a nice ammenity to have. the breakfast was pretty decent- they provide a little bag in the room and you take it down and fill it up with the things they have-not much immediate seating, but there are tables downstairs, by the street and they encourage you to have ""breakfast on the beach""- after the 5th day, the menu repeated itself- but overall good choices- and its rare to find a hotel nowadays that actually provides breakfast- the location isnt bad- its the last hotel on the strip before you hit the zoo/park- so you do have to walk a little more, but not too bad as everything is close by- underneath the hotel, on the ground floor is an ABC store, Coldstone (yumm) and a few other stores which makes eating and shopping quite convenient- they also have quite a few internet kiosks that were great and reasonably priced. the only cons would be that the elevators are slow, and there is nonstop music coming from the restaurant- so even at night there is music going, but its not too bad. also there is no self parking, so you have to valet- which can be kind of annoying if you want to just get up and go- but overall, i would definitely stay there again.",Oct 2005,October 2005,,,"irvine, CA"
3934526,50,ResortQuest Waikiki Beach Tower - Excellent!,"Days stayed: Sept. 15th - 21st, 2005  We (4 people) stayed at the ResortQuest (formerly Aston) Waikiki Beach Tower in an ocean view suite. It has a master bedroom (king bed) with its own double sink and bath. A second bed room with 2 twin beds. A second bath room is in the hall. It has washer and dryer in the suite. Living room has dining table, sofa bed. It has a full kitchenett (with full size refrigerator with ice/water dispensers, stove, microwave, automatic rice cooker, all cooking utensils, dishes, bowls, cups, glasss, wine glasses, dishwasher)... Big sliding doors lead to balcony (with outdoor chairs/tables) overlooking Waikiki beach and the ocean!    Technically, it's a condo!    We stocked up with foods bought from FoodLand and Chinatown. We cooked breakfast, went on our daily ventures, then came back and cooked our own dinners. Caution: you cannot take any fresh fruits that is bought out side of Honolulu Airport back to the US mainland.    Room service is provided everyday. We were able to do our own laundry in the suite! That helped a great deal. We even went home with clean laundry!    PLUSES:  The view is wonderful! You can watch Waikiki sunset from the balcony!  The beach is right downstairs!  Kitchen: save lots from eating out.  Washer/Dryer: You can pack and travel very light!  Staff and maids are very, very friendly.  Parking: Valet - complimentary!  Airconditioning! It works great! But we loved the breeze. We just turned it off and left all windows in all rooms opened all day/night!  If you like fastfood, right downstairs on the left is McDonald, on the right is Jack-in-the-Box!    MINUS:  Internet access is dial-up from the phone in the room.  NO wireless. NO highspeed!!!! Not even in the loby!    It's not cheap! But it's a wonderful place to stay.    ResortQuest has many hotels in Waikiki with similar names.

Furnishings were in fine shape, although they perhaps need  an updating. Staff was more than helpful. Prices are not cheap, but  you definitely get your money's worth here.    We were three in a one bedroom, and if I were to go back, I  would chose the two bedroom.

3888407,40,great hospitality,"They have hospitality mastered in every part of the stay.

We asked to leave our car in valet parking after our check out due to a tour and were told no problem. Free valet parking, newspaper at the door every morning, washer/ dryer in the room and full kitchens. Hotel is directly across from the beach with awesome view of the ocean. Our daughter returned looking cold from her night swim in the ocean and they were there with a towel covering her up without us even asking. Spacious rooms are due for a remodel but I would definately stay again. All of the rooms are 2 bedroom suites- they simple lock the second bedroom and bath if you opt for a one bedroom. We asked if we could have the second room openned and they said it was normally an additional $50.00 per night but only charged us $25.00. We loved it.",Sep 2005,August 2005,,,"Kalispell, MT"
3887171,50,Great with kids,"I stayed at this hotel with my husband, 8 year old daughter and 6 year old son for a week at the end of August, 2005. The staff was phenomenal, so helpful and friendly. They gave us detailed maps every morning to help us get where we were going. If we had a problem with our room, they came right up and fixed it. They had a washer and dryer in the room and we had been worried about finding a grocery store to buy detergent. We were coming from 10 days in Japan and had lots of laundry to do. We found out that they had a small box of Tide (enough for 2 loads in the small washing machine) waiting in the room for us and brought us more when we needed it! The valets were so friendly and ready to talk to and play around with our kids (which the kids loved!). The view was terrific and the location was great. When you walked out of the hotel, the crosswalk was right in front of the hotel and then you were on Waikiki Beach! There was a huge walk-in closet in the master bedroom. All in all, they made our stay in Waikiki perfect! Thanks!",Sep 2005,,,,Raleigh
3667425,50,Full of Aloha Spirit,"This is a great place to stay, right across the street from Waikiki beach. From check-in to check-out we had the best vacation ever! First, the front desk staff are all so friendly and knowledgeble about attractions on the island including locations. Furthermore, they are willing to go out of their way to assist you. When I needed help getting somewhere, they would make very good suggestions to make the experience easier/better. Even before checking in, I called the hotel and Cori was very helpful in providing information regarding Fourth of July activities and Luaus on the Island. She also advised me to skip on packing beach towels, chairs and beach mats as the hotel would provide these items. We were even allowed to take the items to other beaches. The rooms themselves are huge (1200+ sq. ft), we had a 2 bedroom 2 bath on the ninth floor. At check in, we had been upgraded from a partial ocean to a full ocean view, and the view of Waikiki beach was unbelieavable. The balcony (lanai) stretched the length of the room and there were two sliding glass doors to access it, one from the living room and one from the master bedroom. The lanai had a nice seating area where morning coffee could be enjoyed and surfers would be seen bright and early. There is a huge walk-in closet in the master bedroom, and the fully equipped kitchen allows you to save on meals and cook yourself if you prefer to. Another plus is that we did not go home with dirty laundry as there is a washer and dryer in each unit. The only possible drawback is that there are no restaurants on premises, but Waikiki is loaded with places to eat. Duke's at the Outrigger and the Oceanarium at the Pacific Beach Hotel right next door are great places to enjoy breakfast. There is also a McDonald's right next door, which suprisingly had a local style breakfast consisting of eggs, spam, portuguese sausage and white rice! Tiki's Bar and Grill at the other Aston property is great for Dinner. Now back to the staff, the valet staff is awesome! My 10-year-old thought Gregg was the coolest ever, and he would receive a ""shaka"" or ""hang loose"" every time we passed him. All the valet staff helped us out beyond our expectations. My father was in a wheelchair, and they made sure we were taken care of to the fullest extent. My son actually got teary eyed when we left Hawaii, because not only is it a very healing place, but our experience at the Waikiki Beach Tower made us feel part of a family. We will definitely stay at the Waikiki Beach Tower during our next trip to Oahu.",Jul 2005,July 2005,,,"Bisbee, Arizona"
3630107,50,Best Kept Secret on the Island!!!!,"What a great price & location. The Hawaiian music at the Tikis Bar & Grill added a very nice touch. I had a room right above the pool and the scenery from my balcony was incredible. You could see all the way down Waikiki Beach. The hotel was close to shops, the ocean and some really good restaurants. The shuttle stopped by at regular intervals so if you did not rent a car...no problem.    The hotel provided cute bright yellow totes to take your breakfast down to the beach. I did not opt to purchase the breakfast, but after checking out the selection I wish that I would have.    I will definitely stay here again!!!",Jul 2005,May 2005,Traveled on business,,"Salem, Oregon"
3624502,50,Absolutely fantastic!!,"We just returned home from a 9 day stay at the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower. Our vacation was absolutely fantastic!! From check-in to check-out, we had a great time! The staff is awesome, especially the valet's Ed, Russ, Gregg, and Eddie. They were so friendly, and were great with the kids! The housekeeping staff was very friendly and courteous! The twice daily maid service was great! Everynight our beds would be turned down and little treat would be left for us. (Chocolates, cookies, macadamia nuts, etc...) Everytime we passed the front desk we were greeted with a smile and ""Aloha""! Having a full kitchen, and washer and dryer in the room was very convenient for our family of 4. We had an excellent oceanfront room on the 10th floor. (Room 1002) The closets were huge and there was more than enough cabinet/storage space. Walking the streets of Waikiki can be exhilirating or frustrating depending on your preference for action or relaxation. There was alot to see, and tons of shops, most of which were ABC stores. There were street performers, and artists up and down the beachfront strip. The International Marketplace was just a few blocks away. We rented a car for the length of our stay, so we really had a chance to explore the island. It was nice to escape the hub-ub of Waikiki, and see some of the other great beaches. I highly recommend renting a car for at least a couple of days to really get out and see the other parts of the island. We will definitely stay at the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower the next time we visit Oahu!! Aloha!!",Jun 2005,June 2005,,,"Newark, DE"
3604563,40,Wonderful stay!!,We stayed for 7 nights in the condos. Staff was very nice. Our rooms had great view of Waikiki Beach. We had our 10 month old with us and the extra large rooms enabled her to practice her walking without bumping into everything. Would definitely stay there again.,Jun 2005,June 2005,,,"St. Petersburg, Florida"
3545127,40,Great for a condo near the beach with good service,"We stayed a week, enjoyed the property and would stay there again. With a small child, we wanted a 1 bed condo close to the beach (so we wouldn't have to schlep everything for blocks to the beach) and it worked out very well.    It's not cheap ($300+/night). At that price level, you might expect a property comparable to a higher end chain like Ritz or Four Seasons. It's not. And that is okay as long as you know going in what your $300+ is paying for.    What you are paying for is a condo, large rooms, a pleasant staff, and a location across the street from the beach. Plus there are two ABC Stores next door, too. Plus valet parking is complementary, and there is a clothes washer/drier in each unit.    My only gripes (minor as they are) would be:  - because it is not a large hotel, there isn't always a lot of staff around and it took a while for our bags to get delivered to the room after checking in.  - the building is 21 years old and is starting to show the wear and tear of 21 years. Some stains on the carpet, chipped or cracking countertops, things like that. Nothing major though.  - they started doing room maintenance the morning we checked out. Not sure why they could not have waited until we actually checked out.    Overall, we liked it and would go back.",Jun 2005,June 2005,,,San Francisco
3543022,50,Great getaway at the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower!,"Just returned from a 8 night stay in Waikiki. We were treated like family from the moment we arrived. We were pleasantly surprised upon arrival that we had been upgraded to a full ocean view and that (at 12 noon) our room was ready for us. It was very clean and spacious. We felt so comfortable and relaxed. We walked to lunch at Cheeseburgers in  Paradise, then were off to the beach! The staff spoiled us rotten, even insisted on bringing up my groceries for me! We had many meals in...it was like home away from home! The twice daily maid service was a special treat. We were able to borrow everything essential for a great day at the beach, chairs, mats, towels, snorkel gear...even boards for body surfing! Everything is close by, the view was heavenly and having the laundry facility in my room was a HUGE bonus...came home with all clean clothing! We were so sad to leave, felt like we were leaving friends. We can't wait to return!",Jun 2005,June 2005,,,"Medina, Tennessee"
3473635,50,Heaven in Hawaii,"My wife and I just returned from a short trip to Oahu and the only complaint I have is that it could have been longer. The hotel was excellent. From the very fun and courteous valet (Greg- who kindly provided me with a bottle opener for my cold beer after the long 10 hour flight) to the magnificent oceanfront room. After Greg showed us to our 22nd floor suite we decided that we could spend the rest of our vacation in the room. The view was incredible with Diamond Head to the left, the Royal Hawaiian to the right and the ever so blue pacific with its abundance of surfers straight ahead. (did I mention the sunsets) The suite was very spacious with access to the balcony from both the living area and the bedroom. The bathroom was large with two sinks and a walk-in closet. The twice a day maid service was excellent leaving us a different goody each night on our pillow after turning down the bed. There is no restaurant at the hotel but they do offer room service and there are many places to eat within walking distance. Waikiki beach is right across the street and there are numerous shops along Kalakaua Ave. We highly recommend Moose Mcgillycuddy's for lunch and Tiki's Grill and Bar for dinner. Once again, we would like to thank the gracious staff for a wonderful stay. Mahalo!",May 2005,April 2005,,,Mars Hill NC USA
3423338,50,Great Condo!,"Just arrived home after a REAL vacation! This proptery is just wonderful. We stayed 5 nights. Eddy and Gregg, the doormen are GREAT! John, at the frontdesk is very kind.    We had the Grandparents, two kids (all under the age of 4 years), and us, Mom and Dad. A ""spur of the molment trip"" as we work for an airline. Glanced over the reviews, and asked fellow co-workers where to stay, they ALL said this was a great place ""to park"" and not have to do anything, they were right!    Right across from the Kuhio beach, on Waikiki Beach, (check out the LIVE cameras on the web, just put in the Hawaii transportation site...that is YOUR beach!) The rooms are very clean and well layed out. Beautiful views, we were on the 15th floor, very quiet, (don't go any lower than that), as the Circle Hotel is right in front and can block your view if staying in a room with a ""4"" in it...Each floor has 4 condo's on it. 1, 2, 3, 4...4 is an ""end"" suite, and ""3"" is in the middle. ""1"" and ""2"" are on the Diamond Head side. Some rooms have a ""partial"" view of the ocean, or a FULL ocean view ( we could see it ALL in a partial) and the back of the room is a view of the mountains, the BEST of both world's. The pool is very nice and the hot tub, great!  We brought with us, EZ Mac and Cheese, popcorn, and packaged oatmeal, for the microwave. Three ABC store's are right outside the door, and you can pick up liquor, mixers, beer, water, sodas, milk, oj, sweet rolls, cereal, crackers, cheese, chips and dips, fruit etc.. beach rafts/bags, sand toys, thongs, t-shirts, bathingsuits, dresses, candies, and all kinds of stuff! For fast food you have it ALL! Jack in the Box, McDonald's and Burger King. There is Coffee EVERYWHERE and in your room! At the Hyatt, nextdoor, there is a place called ""Kimo's Coffee"" with FREE wireless internet, they just ask that you buy something, NO problem! The condo has dish soap, dishwasher soap, washing machine soap, and soap and shampoo in your rooms, so do not bring it! You also have and iron and board. Towels are changed daily, as is bedding, and you have BEACH TOWELS, too! We enjoyed the DVD, and VHS player, with the cable TV...we brough movies and Cd's to listen to while hanging out the the room. And the kids could play video games...which they did not do, as they were so tired from a day at the beach!    We went to dinner at the TIKI Lounge, great with kids and HUGE portions. We went to Duke's, Shorebird, Chili's, Hula Grill, all wonderful!    There is a BIG grocery store across the street from Chili's, if you need things like diapers,and/or larger grocery items not found at the ABC. All in all a five star rating for this place. You do not need or want a car on Honolulu, (they do have Free parking, at the property for one car). We took Robert's shuttle to the hotel, roundtip, CHEAP! And used the city bus to get around. But the condo was SOOOOO nice, we just wnated to hang out there!    Have fun and Aloha!",Apr 2005,April 2005,,,"Bay Area, California"
3398382,40,Nice hotel for family vacation,"Stayed at the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower for spring break with 2 teenagers and had a generally pleasant experience. Spacious 2-bedroom suite with beautiful water view, fabulous bellmen and valet parking service, with a few inconsistencies in service.    We arrived at the hotel at noon, were told our 2-bedroom suite would be ready between 2:30 and 3 pm, and were given an excellent recommendation for a nearby casual restaurant for a restorative lunch. However, at 3 pm we were told that our room would be ready 'sometime' that afternoon. I had to insist on guaranteed 3 pm check-in to get our room. The desk clerk became hostile when I insisted on 3 pm check-in, turned his back on me and refused to speak. We observed several other family parties between noon and 3 pm that were checked-in immediately to 2-bedroom suites on nearby floors, so it was difficult to understand our wait. At the rates you pay for this hotel this kind of service is not acceptable.    The rooms are a bit run down, though generally clean and comfortable (and roomy). Unfortunately our maid service was anytime between 10 am and 4 pm so it was difficult to make a point of being out of the room to get out of their way. Evening turn-down service and linen replacement is a real treat when you've been on the beach all day and leave your bathroom messy while cleaning up before dinner. It's quiet, quiet, quiet at this hotel. I never heard another guest or maid service in other suites.    There's a supermarket two long blocks away on Kuhio, across the street from Chili's restaurant. Good prices, good selection, easy walk to hotel, MUCH cheaper than ABC stores.    The pool and sundeck are clean and nice, and generally sparsely populated, so a great place to get away from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki. There's even a large shaded area on the sundeck to enjoy the heat but avoid being cooked alive.    Can't say enough about the marvelous guys handling baggage and cars -- always made our day!    Recommendations in Waikiki:  Eat at Tiki's up the street--super service and good food! Don't bother with Top of Waikiki -- lousy service. Duke's Canoe Club is okay if Red Lobster is your idea of fine dining, otherwise go there for the people-watching, not the food.    Go to Germaine's Luau, and try to get Cousin Greg as your host on the bus there and back. His patter made the time fly, and after many mai tai's on the beach, he made the ride home hysterical, and the ideal end to a great week in Honolulu. Even our teenagers found him a riot. The luau itself is like every other I've been to, but the bus trip was the best part and worth every $.",Apr 2005,April 2005,,,"Seattle, WA"
3346749,50,Michiganders loved the spacious and friendly environment,"Spring break at the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower April 2005 was a great choice for a family. Because we were traveling with a teenager, we wanted the space provided in a two bedroom, two bathroom unit. This condo is indeed spacious. TV in the master bedroom and in the livingroom. DVD player in the LR, and they brought us a VCR to tape the MSU mens and womens basketball big 10 championship games, at no charge.  Things I wish I had known :  1. Don't pack coffee or laundry detergent, the twice daily maid service furnishes both.  2. Bring a small suitcase filled with grocery items for the week, then you can re-pack the suitcase with your great shopping finds on the return flight home. Wonderful location for shopping!  3. For milk and other essentials, this hotel is located within a few feet of an ABC store that has all you need. There is an even bigger store (Longs Pharmacy) at the Alona Shopping Mall about 1 1/4 miles west, a $2.00 public bus ride away. ($1.00 for students)  4. Do not grab fresh fruit as a snack to stick in a carry on bag for the return flight home. I bought a single banana for $1.59 at the ABC store just before departing for the airport, and they took it away due to the agricultural rules on the island. They even took away our 2 remaining Michigan apples. It's aparently okay to bring over a banana and an apple, but not okay to leave with them. Who knew?  5. Waikiki is VERY WINDY. Ladies, be prepared with a light layer of jacket or wrap for morning and evening. My husband never used an additonal layer. Must be a guy thing.  6. Waikiki gets a misty rain spattering on and off throughout the day. Sometimes it is barely noticable, other times you'd prefer to seek cover. An umbrella isn't a bad idea, along with a rain poncho if you plan to hike in the rainforest area to see the waterfalls.  7. All of the attractions (Luau's, cruises, special tours) take your picture then sell it to you for $20.00 I wish I had known this, I would have stategically chosen what to wear, removed the sunglasses, etc.  8. About one block behind the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower on Kuhio Ave and two blocks west, is an Internet access site. (Can I mention the Fishbowl by name?) Our teenager was very happy about being able to instant message her friends.  9. We stayed the week without renting a car. The Bus has a great route to Diamond head, and up to the Nature Preserves and bays that I can not spell. The attractions and tours pick up either at your hotel or directly across the street. Very easy.  10. Explore all of he other near by area beaches and hotels, just for fun. There is a great beach just a 15 minute walk west, located at the Army base. It is open to the public. It has the best shade and is away from the noise and traffic in front of the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower. Make sure you learn the exact name of this hotel. There is also an Aston Waikiki Beach hotel. Easy to get these confused. Start practicing the name of this hotel now. You will often be asked where you are staying.  Aloha",Apr 2005,April 2005,,,"East Lansing, Michigan"
3226788,50,"Great Hotel, Outstanding Location","We are at the hotel at this moment, for a 10 day stay at the end of February 2005. The rooms are spacious, the Lanai is great, and the view is priceless. We occupy a two bedroom suite on the 31st floor, so nothing obstructs the view of the ocean, Diamon Head, or the beach. The fully stocked kitchen (dishes etc.), washer and dryer, and complimentary valet parking are all worth the price of acmission. We love it here.    The Vuez clan.",Feb 2005,,,,"Edmonton, Canada"
3193392,50,Add my five stars,"Our family of 6 stayed at the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower for about a week in the summer of 2004, in a two-bedroom oceanfront condo. After just coming from a quiet resort on the Big Island, we were in shock at the hustle and bustle of Waikiki. Once we got up to our rooms in the Beach Tower and settled in we knew we would love it there for different reasons--all the comforts of home and the convenience of being high above but still at Waikiki. The location is great--plenty of restaurants and shopping right out the front door. The beach is a let-down, but we enjoyed watching the surfers from high above. Having the kitchen and the washer/dryer was great. The hotel staff was friendly and our rooms were well-kept, though a little dated. We never waited long for the elevator. This is a great place for families--highly recommended.",Feb 2005,January 2005,,,"San Antonio, Texas"
3178904,50,Aston Waikiki is #1 accomadation,"We stayed at the Aston Waikiki the week of January 31/05. The hotel is situated at the quiet end of Waikiki, one block from the zoo and right across the street from the beach. From our balcony we had a stunning view of the ocean and the unforgettable sunsets. On the other side of the hotel was a clear view of Diamond Head. The room had a king size bed and lots of space. A buffet breakfast is available every morning with the most flavorful Kona coffee. The hotel provides all services such as Internet access, sightseeing activities, hairdryer, iron etc. Entertainment at Tiki's Bar & Grill through the day and night. Our room was soundproof and it was a wonderful vacation. Would definitly stay there again.",Feb 2005,,,,"Comox Valley, B.C."
3173846,50,The best yet,"My wife and I just returned from 6 nights at the Aston Tower. Although it was our first trip to Hawaii we have traveled quite a bit throughout the world and must say, the ""Tower"" is without a doubt the best. The accomodations were great, the staff was very friendly and professional. We opted for the 1 bedroom deluxe ocean front. The rooms were very spacious, the twice daily maid service was great. The only down side I might thing of is the great ocean front balcony. We spent way to many hours sitting out there enjoying the relaxing view when we should have been out sight seeing. I must say, it was well worth the extra money we spent to get a room here.",Feb 2005,January 2005,,,Utah
3026896,50,A suite room!,"The hotel room was like a suite. It had a large living room with a very comfortable foldaway bed in the couch. We had a king size bed in the bedroom. The kitchen was comparable to a house size kitchen. Dining area was big. There were plenty of closet space and a stacked washer and dryer. Laundry detergent and dish soap were provided. All kitchen utensils, dishes, and pots and pans are also provided. We made our own breakfast everyday, took our lunch to the beach, and went out for dinner at night. It was a great deal.",Jan 2005,,,,"Los Angeles, California"
2965674,50,Absolutely Wonderful,We stayed here for a week in September 2004 and it was wonderful. Very clean and the staff was very accommodating. We had a oceanfront room and it was worth every penny. You are directly across from the beach so you can hear the waves at night. I will always stay here when visiting Oahu from now on and highly recommend it to anyone else.,Dec 2004,,,,"Carmel, Indiana"
2880351,50,Delightful Experience,"Arrived at night in pouring down rain, had only general idea where hotel was located, called the hotel, friendliest guy in the world answered and talked me all the way there. ( And if you've never been to Hawaii, there are no big glowing neon signs to point you to your destination!) Staff warm and genuinely friendly. Every need we had was met quickly. Place was clean and tidy, twice daily maid service, great view of ocean, beach across the street! Excellent place to stay!",Dec 2004,,,,Alabama
2855015,50,Loved the Aston Beach Towers on our First Stay in Hawaii,"We spent a week in October at the Aston Beach Towers and loved it! Staff were so friendly and helpful.........especially Greg at the valet desk. He was so helpful in giving suggestions and directions, always with a smile. The front desk clerks also nothing but polite. Housekeeping was exceptional....rooms very clean. Service twice a day with towels replaced as soon as used and bed turndown at night with a special treat on your pillow. Being over 55, we were given an upgrade to an oceanview room.......outstanding. The view of the ocean was fantastic. No restaurants on premises, but many good restaurants (and shopping) within walking distance. We will not hesitate to stay at this hotel again if and when we return to Oahu!",Nov 2004,,,,"Bakersfield, Ca."
2703692,50,Our home away from home,"My husband just returned from a marvelous stay at the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower. We have had several vacation trips to Oahu. We thought our previous accommodations were good. Staying at the Wakiki Beach Tower was like experiencing the wonderful island of Oahu for the first time! The room was incredible. It had the most spectacluar view of the ocean and all the excitement of Waikiki. The fully furnished kitchen was perfect. We spent every morning on the lanai eating a home cooked breakfast. It was very romantic! We were in Hawaii celebrating our 23rd wedding anniversary. We plan on celebrating many more at the Wakiki Beach Towers. All of the staff members were very friendly and courteous. If you have any doubts about this hotel, feel free to e-mail us! It is absolutely the place to stay. Aloha!

2657427,50,Awesome!,"The beach tower is an incredible hotel. The room was excellent!!! It was clean, spacious and was fully loaded with all the necessities. The view was fantastic! We had a room with a ""partial view"" only because a smaller hotel was located to the right of us. Even with that, we still had a panoramic view of the water. I'm sure the people on the higher floors would confirm my statement.    The staff was very courteous and informative. We were always greeted with a smile and a friendly ""mahalo"".    The hotel is located right next to everything, the beach, couple blocks from The Marketplace, a few more blocks from the DFS and novelty stores.    I would give this hotel an A+.",Oct 2004,,,,"Rosemead, CA"
2590877,40,Lovely Property,"After a terrible night at the Aston Waikiki Sunset (old, dirty rooms), we switched to the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower. What a pleasant surprise. The rooms were very large and the furnishings were pleasant! We had two young children and a babysitter traveling with us - everyone had plenty of room. The view was magnificent and the location couldn't have been more convenient. We were in Hawaii for a destination wedding. Our suite was large enough to accommodate a number of guests for a pre-party. We would return to this property and think it is a good value for the area (large room sizes, good location, nice furnishings).",Sep 2004,,,,"Chicago, IL"
2496465,50,Couldn't be Better!,"We couldn't fault this wonderful condo. After reading lots of reviews of lots of places, I'd have to say that everything was excellent (except for the American fondness for dim lighting!) (I had to remove the lamp shades so we could read). No elevator queues, friendly competent staff in all areas, gorgeous condo, great location and views, masonry construction (so no noise transference between condos) - no street noise with doors closed. We had been staying on the north shore in a house I'd booked over the internet, and it was ok at best, so finding accommodation in Waikiki Beach Tower at the last minute was fantastic.",Aug 2004,,,,Sydney Australia

2283890,50,what a view!,"we just returned 6/30 from a one week stay at the aston waikiki beach towers. we'd go back in second. we booked the one bedroom, full ocean view. it has a hugh lanai, with chairs and a table. great for early morning breakfasts. very spacious and comfortable. it was great to have a washer/dryer. the kitchen was fully stocked with all the cooking untensils you would need to fix a complete dinner. all appliances full size. very clean throughout. everyone was very nice . especially ED at the front desk. very helpfull and courteous. the location is great, just cross the street and your on waikiki beach. they will even loan you beach chairs and mats. buy a blow up mat at the abc store just feet from the entrance and your ready to go (abc will blow up the mat for .60 cents). the food/ restaurants were very expensive . next time i'd take the bus/taxi down the road a few miles to the safeway and stock up on the fixings for at least a few meals . you could probably eat for a week on what it costs for one dinner for 3. the cheescake factory on the main drag (a five minute walk from the tower) was really good, lots of choices for dinner or lunch, and the cheesecake was great(try the key lime cheesecake). take the e noa tour for the arizona and circle island. we had a guide named jeremy. he was really good. very interesting. the beach towers was expensive but we weren't dissapointed at all. well worth it. all the previous tripadvisor reviews for the beach tower helped me make my decision. they were right on the money. hope this helps someone too. can't wait to return to the waikiki beach towers.",Jul 2004,June 2004,,,"monterey, ca"

I would like any traveler out there to know, this is the best place to stay in Waikiki, Ocean Front Views, very spacious Condo units, beautiful decor, absolutely the best and friendlous staff.

1664286,40,Aston Wakiki Beach - Family Friendly and Overall nice place,"I was very nervous after reading some of the reviews of this property.  We were traveling with our 2 children and wanted a nice clean place to stay. Expedia's ratings leave a lot to be desired, plus they are compensated for they're representation of these hotels.We were very pleasantly surprised. Aside from some very morose choice of colors in the halls the hotel was clean. A breakfast buffet was provided daily with a nice assortment of things - all you acn eat. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The only bad note was a $13.00 per day parking fee that we were not told of. Not too bad considering that almost everywhere we went charged for (or did not have) parking. I would happily go again. It was a beautiful area to visit and knwing we had a clean safe place to return to each evening made it a lot more fun.",Feb 2004,,,,"Bridgewater, MA"
1550976,50,Incredible!!,"After a very delayed flight from the east coast (our trip took 24 hrs rather than 12), we arrived at the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower at midnight and were immediately greeted with the friendliest and warmest people. The size of the condo, the view of the ocean and the twice a day maid service was perfect! Our travel agent totally mixed up our scheduled trips around Oahu and without the staff at the Beach Tower working overtime to get us a new schedule, our trip would have been a disappointment! The condo is perfectly located on the strip within walking distance of everything. Highly, highly recommend!",Jan 2004,,,,Georgia
1533198,50,One of the best places to stay in Honolulu!,"This review is way overdue. My family of 5 stayed here in 1996. Our t/a got us a great deal including airfare. This condo was great! We were greeted warmly and our accomodations were superb! My husband, son, and I occupied one bedroom and my parents the second bedroom. One of the best things is that there are two bathrooms so there's privacy and convenience for everyone. The living room was so spacious and it overlooked the beach. Also convenient was the kitchen and the washer/dryer combo. The latter came in really handy since we could clean our clothes as necessary. There was a small lanai also and it was great to sit out there and watch the sunset. The pool is very tiny and may be the only drawback. But with the beach just across the street who cares about a pool? There was turndown service nightly and the housekeeper left shells on our bed-very unique. If we return to Honolulu this is the only place we will stay. Glad to know others feel the same and the quality has not diminished over the years.",Dec 2003,,,,USA
1517770,50,"even bigger than I expected, better than I can describe","The Aston Waikiki Beach Tower is just what the doctor ordered for our 8 day family vacation on Waikiki. It was even bigger than I expected, and better than I can describe. With our two teenagers, it allowed everyone their own space and privacy for grooming, dressing, etc., but also had large spaces for gathering in the living room, dining room, and balcony. Great location. Amazingly helpful staff, very friendly valets.  Great views. Washer and dryer turned out to be a life saver. Full size refrigerator, stove, and complete table service allowed us to save time and money on breakfast most days, and we even cooked dinner one night.Don't let the small lobby or lack of a restaurant deter you - this place is well worth the extra bucks you might pay over a standard bed-TV-desk hotel room.",Dec 2003,November 2004,,,"Covington, Louisiana"
1283404,50,Aston Waikiki Beach Tower Condos are a great way to go with family!,"We flew from California to Honolulu and our relatives from Japan also flew to Honolulu. We had two rooms at the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower. One had an Ocean Front view and the other room a partial ocean view. Both rooms were superb! Each room had two bedrooms and two baths. They had a full kitchen and large living room. The balconies had more than enough room to have about 10 people sit out there. The staff was more than helpful. John and Spencer were always pleasant and assisted us with our questions and needs. The same goes for the Concierge, Gregg, who was always willing to go the extra mile. We booked thru the hotel website and received 3 nights with the 4th night free. A good deal for this hotel. It came out to approx. $300 per night. Well worth it if you have quite a few people in a room. I would highly recommend the hotel!",Sep 2003,,,,California
1212667,50,Beautiful property with a friendly staff,"My family and I have just returned from Waikiki after an 8 day/7 night stay at the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower Condominium...... not to be confused with the Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel or Aston Waikiki Beachside Hotel as several of the previous posts have. This is a luxury property; a condo with many of the amenitites of a hotel. Upon our arrival and after a long, 11- hour plane ride, we were greeted cheerfully and checked in within 10 minutes. We were each given a bottle of ice cold water to sip on as we sped through the check-in. We produced our room voucher, listened to a brief explanation of the amenities and were soon on our way to our Premium Oceanfront Condo. (We had booked Deluxe Oceanfront but were upgraded to a Premium unit on the 33 floor with spectacular views of both the beach and Diamond Head) The 2 bedroom /2 bath condo, complete with washer/dryer and full kitchen as well as a lanai that was the entire width of the condo was extremely clean and well maintained. Wooden hangars, down pillows, free daily newspaper, 3 tv's, twice daily maid service including turndown service, concierge services, swimming pool and FREE valet parking were just some of the perks that made us come to love this place! Everyone from the front desk clerks to the bellmen and the parking attendants were friendly and helpful. We were just steps from the beach (beach towels are also available from the front desk so no need to bring your own) and within walking distance to just about everything. We highly recommend this property and would stay there again without reservation!",Aug 2003,July 2003,,,"West Islip, New York"
1135337,50,Great Aston Waikiki Beach Tower,"We stayed at this property for 10 days. It has beautiful condo'a. Large balcony (lanai), 2 bedrooms, two bathrooms, 2 televisions, large living area, kitchen, and washer and dryer. Maids were very efficient and polite. Valet parking that was free and courteous. Nice pool, and hot tub. Billards available, great location. All very positive. The only negative, is that it was difficult to find. Its parking garage is across the street from Pacific Beach Hotel, which would have been nice to know. We arrived at night, and few of the streets have signs, or numbers that are visible in the dark. Highly reccomend this property.",Jul 2003,,,,
925531,50,Loved the Hotel,"The Aston Waikiki Beach Tower in my opinion is one of the best places to stay in Waikiki if you have a family. From the wonderful service of the attendants (Gregg and Russ) to the fantastic views from the spacious lanai's, the hotel was great. The rooms are big and offer the opportunity to eat ""at home."" My family and I will make an annual trip back to this hotel!",Mar 2003,,,,"San Diego, CA"
