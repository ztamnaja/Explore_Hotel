864284616,50,Simply the best!,"We have stayed at Hualalai many, many times over the las decade and have always had a wonderful experience. Amazing food. Warm, yet professional staff. Always so sad when we have to return home, but start planning our next stay before we even get on the plane to go back!",Yesterday,September 2022,,,
857155674,50,Top-Notch Stay in Every Way,"Four Seasons Hualalai is one of the best resorts we've ever encountered. Everything is at the top level, from the welcome with leis and drinks to the departure with the friendly and helpful desk staff. We stayed in an ocean view room (king plus pull-out for our child) with the lava rock shower, which I can't recommend enough. We were offered an upgrade to a second-floor room but turned it down since we wanted that outdoor shower - this was the right choice! Our room faced the beach and we could easily hear the sound of the waves from our lanai. Being on the first floor also meant having direct access to the lawn/gardens and we were just steps from the quiet pool. What a beautiful setting! The landscaping and architecture make your room feel isolated even with people right next door, and the low buildings make the entire resort feel intimate in a way that a high-rise never could.    Every interaction we had with staff was welcoming, thoughtful, and attentive. We especially loved how the staff would come by our beach chairs throughout the day to refill our ice waters and offer little complimentary refreshments such as popsicles, fruit, and frozen grapes. They would even clean your sunglasses for you!    One of our favorite features of this resort is the beach in front of the Seashell (family) pool. There is a lava rock barrier which creates a safe place to swim and snorkel and buffers the area from large waves. It's still fun for older kids and adults as you can get some good waves in high tide, and there is sea life (a very charming sea turtle swam around for most of our visit) but you don't worry as much about predators or jellyfish as I would in the open ocean. The water is very warm and in the morning is still and smooth. I do recommend bringing water shoes because there are sea urchins among the rocks even in that area and we did see one person step on one (easily remedied by staff who have a kit to neutralize the stingers - but still unpleasant).    Every meal we had was terrific - the prices are frankly astonishingly high so be prepared, but again the service and the quality were top notch. We ate at Ulu, Beach Tree, and Hualalai Grille and each one was unique and delicious with plenty of choices for both food and beverages. We also liked the Surf Shack by the beach for easy (and reasonably priced!) lunches. The breakfast buffet at Ulu is not to be missed!",Aug 2022,August 2022,,,"New York, NY"
863292477,40,"Grounds exceptional, Service spotty","We have stayed at this resort 4-5 times. Comparatively to our past visits...the grounds and rooms are wonderfully exceptional, however the service / food by the ground staff (not management or front lobby-they're wonderful) was extremely disappointing. Mediocre or poor-quality food, slow and without enthusiasm wait staff, rarely acknowledged by name, poor/slow pool service. Just extremely disappointed in the overall service experience...again, the grounds and rooms are great! We look forward to the Rosewood property opening in Kona Village next door. We luv our Rosewood properties in Mexico so we look forward to spending our thousands with Rosewood and experiencing what service they will provide.",Oct 5,September 2022,,,"Plano, Texas"

861482506,40,Five star but a few nits,"I usually frequent the Wailea FS but wanted to try this one and another hotel on the Big Island. The resort is really a series of casita like rooms with no grand lobby or connecting rooms. Everywhere is golf cart transported from the valet (excellent btw). The main restaurant however is just average. One dish was burnt and the back waiter brought out entree’s and asked ‘ who was having etc …’ an absolute no no in a fine dining restaurant. Used dishes were left on the side stands visible to diners as hoards of sparrows ate off the plate ( I don’t think sparrows are cute I think they are a notch above pigeons ). I witnessed three restaurant workers standing nearby but not really reacting something that is constantly monitored at Wailea FS. They have a swim able aquarium which some would love but all I could think of was fish doo doo probably something left over from Cleaning a fish bowl as a kid. The ocean shoreline is gorgeous but rocky and not really swim able, nothing like the stellar beach at the Mauna Kea or Wailea. The pools are beautiful infinity pools and service is excellent. They are relaxing and nothing chaotic as Wailea can be. The rooms all seem to have views and are gorgeous and newly redone. This is a five star resort with a few nits.",Sep 2022,September 2022,Traveled with family,,"Los Angeles, California"
861279343,30,Four sessons is not Fourseasons as it was.,"We visited the Four Seasons again at a time when the Covid Pandemic improved. The beautiful garden and the smile of the staff pleased us, but the soggy room, the bed, and the cleaning condition that couldn't be worse than anything else, ruined our vacation. All the time staying at a great resort has been ruined by housekeeping. The shower booth and bed washbasin remained untouched, and the floor and sofa were not cleaned, so I rather cleaned up again. I really don't want to think again. We've thought there's no better alternative than the Four Seasons, but I don't think I'll be able to choose the Four Seasons to avoid ruining my next vacation if these services don't improve.",Sep 2022,September 2022,,,"Seoul, South Korea"
861239965,50,Best resort ever!,Wow - what a great resort on the Big Island. So many things to do on and off resort and the service and accommodations were impeccable. The breakfast buffet was amazing. I just cannot think of anything negative about the experience at this resort.,Sep 2022,September 2022,,There are so many good rooms - each has its own features and good views.,Virginia & Maine
860740242,40,Bucket List Visit that fell a little short,"It has taken me some time to think about our visit before posting this review because some of the experience was not quite what we expected. This was a bucket list resort for us for several reasons but especially because my husband has long wanted to play the golf course and we love the Big Island and lots of reviews refer to this resort as the Best in Hawaii and even the World. We are not wealthy, we are hard-working professionals who will splurge on travel and golf experiences. When we managed to snag what appeared to be a “low” price for the lowest category room (but still expensive) we gulped and booked three nights to add on to the 5 nights we were staying at Westin Hapuna. We joked with friends that one night here cost us more than our air/hotel package honeymoon to Paradise Island in 1986! So this is a review for people like us and some of our opinion on “Is it worth it?”    What’s Worth It: The Pros. Yes, the service was very good and we liked being able to communicate via the app with the concierge. And the pre-visit experience was also very good. The service at the pools/beach was very good and special shout out to Kelly who took care of us for two days at the Beachtree Pool, she was great and we enjoyed chatting with her. The ocean golf-view room had a better view than expected (even from first floor) and was more conveniently located than we expected, we thought it was going to be far away from the main part of resort but it wasn’t and being so close to golf clubhouse/cultural center was a plus. We were glad we didn’t pay lots more for a higher category, in fact, we found our location much quieter than the rooms located near the pools/beach. And the outdoor shower was really fun…we never took an indoor shower! Food - The food was very good, what we liked best was the pasta at Beachtree. The ladies at the Hawaiian Cultural Center were wonderful, I took a fun and educational bracelet weaving class (complimentary) and since I like arts & crafts if I had stayed longer I would have taken more advantage of this. The location of the property is of course spectacular and the design is just right for Hawaii, low-rise, lots of coastline, open air. I like to walk for exercise and so that was a real plus. Golf experience and course was excellent and definitely worth it.    Cons - Maybe Not Worth It: The drinks. We enjoy our cocktails, especially on vacation and for the cost of $50+ for two drinks you want them to be excellent. I was on a mission to try as many different Mai Tais as possible on this trip (#vacationgoals) and had better drinks at Westin Hapuna, Mauna Kea Hotel and Merriman’s on Maui. Did try the $40!!! Mai Tai at Ulu because hey, was wondering how a drink that expensive would be…it was the best I had at the 4S but it then again, it was $40. Restaurant experience…if you want a romantic, quiet couples trip do not visit here in summer or during school holidays. Our dinners were somewhat marred by all the kids running and playing loudly on the lawns/beach in front of Beachtree restaurant and Residents restaurant. The Bar Experience - we like an upscale bar/cocktail lounge experience and that really does not exist here…the bars are part of the restaurants and pools and so don’t really have an identity as a destination and experience if that makes sense. For example Copper Bar at Mauna Kea Beach Hotel or the lovely outdoor balcony cocktail lounge at the Fairmont Orchid. We missed that here. The “feeling/ambience” of the resort….something about how all the buildings are separate and spread out made it seem like a “central identity” was missing and so it did not quite capture us “heart and soul”…it felt like a bunch of upscale beach/pool clubs strung together along the coastline. I realize this sound extremely picky but for example, Mauna Kea Beach Hotel gave us a Hawaiian resort feeling that FS Hualalai did not. Last but not least, we were turned off by the blatant attempts to get us to pay for a room upgrade, I have never encountered this anywhere else. A few weeks before our trip we were emailed an offer, which we declined. And then at check in, we were made the offer again to pay $200 more a night…what, we are paying $1,200 a night for a room, excited about our visit and immediately when we arrive you are indicating it is not good enough? And by the way it is our Anniversary and you can’t offer a complimentary upgrade? Tacky and not what we expected to start off our visit.    I don’t want all of this to make anyone think we didn’t enjoy our stay, we did! Did it blow us away??? Obviously not. Is it worth trying once? Of course! We were glad we arranged our trip to do all our excursions/island touring while were at the Hapuna…because when you pay the cost of the 4S…you want to spend the entire time at the resort. If you are looking for the quintessential upscale Hawaiian beach resort experience and can pay the price, then this is it. Would we return? Yes, at a price that was right for us, but we’d do the same as we did and combine a short visit with one of the other wonderful resorts on the Big Island because we have now stayed at a number of them and they each have unique advantages.",Sep 2022,August 2022,Traveled as a couple,,"Highland Village, Texas"
860144668,50,SUPERB,Probably the best hotel in the world. Nothing but great thiungs to say. My son left a favorite book in our room- which we discovered when we returned home.

Let’s be honest I actually fell in love with the Four Seasons stuff! from the minute I entered the resort we were greeted with Napua at the front desk , who is very kind and accommodating along with Keanu at valet and I would love to point out Koa who gave us a personal tour of the property that made us feel at home.  On the last day we got greeted by the resort manager graham who asked us how are stay went.

858939409,50,FSR Hualalai is Hard to Beat,"My wife and I have stayed at some wonderful resorts throughout the world, but we had yet to experience the quality of service and caring we received the the FSR Hualalai. The property is spectacularly set on the Pacific and boasts architecture and landscaping which fits perfectly with the natural setting. The food in the Ulu restaurant is outstanding and creative. The wait staff attentive and making every effort to please. The concierge will arrange snorkeling with Manta Rays which is a must. For a relaxing, rejuvenating retreat, FSR Hualalai is hard to match.",Sep 2022,August 2022,,,"San Diego, California"
858690589,40,Very nice but overpriced food,Very nice grounds and excellent rooms in very good condition and very clean.  Limited beach in front of hotel and small swimming area in ocean but one further away that is accessible.  Restaurants are way overpriced for what is served (count $200 minimum /head/day) without splurging.  Great concierge service and nice staff overall.  Location is isolated so one is pretty captive on site.,Sep 2022,September 2022,Traveled as a couple,,"Paris, France"
858610290,20,"Big Island, Big Mistakes","*I booked this stay using Amex FHR.  -Upgraded room (very minor but ✅)  -$75 breakfast credit  -$100 dining credit  -early check in was not available due to my disappointment with the upgrade  -guaranteed late 4pm check out *    Let’s start with the room- I was originally upgraded to a prime ocean view room from an ocean view room, this was already disappointing. Usually at higher costing Amex FHRs , they will upgrade your room to a suite. For example, I booked a corner room at the Ritz Carlton Waikiki and was given an upgrade to a corner suite, which is at least a 3 category upgrade. However, at FS Hualalai they were only willing to offer a 1 category upgrade. Due to my disappointment in the upgrade I was willing to pay for a lower level suite. I thought it was implied I wanted an outdoor shower since I specifically asked if my original room was lower level. However, after paying $650 and waiting for an hour , I checked into a suite that did not have an outdoor shower, and had a very partial ocean view. It was already past 3pm at this point, so I didn’t want to waste anymore time trying to check into a desired suite.  As for the service, as stated above I feel as though the front desk team needs some work. Not only did the greeting/ check in feel very rushed, they didn’t even get the welcome amenity right. I responded to several emails beforehand and signed off those emails with my preferred name -“Bella.” The birthday card that came with the cake printed out my full name..that no one ever really calls me. Also they treated me as if I was not the cardholder, and seemed to be surprised when I took the card out of my wallet at check in.  In addition to the less than stellar welcome, there was an incident on a golf cart that could have easily been avoided. My Grandfather (who I had paid for and added as a registered guest) fell and was dragged off a golf cart causing injury to his knee and head. The driver sped off before checking that everyone was on. My Grandfather was left dazed from the fall and the only “help” that was given was ice in a ziplock bag. I waited a few days to write this review to give FS Hualalai a chance to address this incident and follow up with a very sincere apology, but have not received anything of the sort.  I have stayed at other Four Seasons locations on the islands, and none of them felt as unwelcoming as Hualalai. The ‘2’ rating is simply because the pool, spa, and restaurant staff were nice.",Sep 2022,August 2022,,,"Lahaina, Hawaii"

856339200,30,Summer 2022 Stay at Four Seasons Hualalai,"While I certainly appreciate the challenges COVID has created in terms of the labor industry, my recent experience at the FS Hualalai was vastly different than pre-pandemic. There were some stand outs in terms of the quality of service - James at Beach Tree and in general the staff there were outstanding as well at the bartender at Ulu. The staff at the Trading Company was also outstanding and our experience at the Tennis club was wonderful. Our daughter also had a wonderful time with the Marine Experiences team both on the behind the scenes feeding the morning of her 5th birthday as well as the private tide pool experience.    However, the breakfast staff at Ulu was extremely inconsistent and untrained and the food was horrendous especially when compared to breakfast at the competing hotel of the Mauna Lani. The pancakes ordered were burnt, an order of eggs Benedict was raw and the staff uncaring. The pool service at the King's Pond was horrendous with us having to make multiple requests and reminders for things like drinks. Checkin was also haphazard with us being greeted by someone who was obviously new and clearly hadn't reviewed out itinerary. Housekeeping was also very inconsistent, sometimes we'd be provided new water, sometimes not. Trash was only emptied occasionally. The landscaping team has done a fantastic job as the resort still appears incredible. That said, we never saw any cockroaches on prior stays and this time had them in our room on several occasions. Lastly, and most disgusting was that upon checkin, we found a large pile of feces being swarmed by flies by the outdoor rinse shower adjacent to our room in the King's Pond area and immediately informed the pool staff there who did nothing about it and it was still there the next morning. This ruined our in-room dining experience that night as we opted to have it on the patio but had to fend off hordes of flies that had obviously been feeding on the feces. It was not until we went to the front desk and complained again the next morning that engineering/maintenance did something about it and cleaned it up. The front desk staff was also less than apologetic and seemed to treat it as something that occurs regularly.",Aug 2022,August 2022,,,"Walnut Creek, California"

853721488,40,Hope the updates made it better,"This is for a trip done in June 2021 so the information could be dated. That was our second stay at the hotel. Our first was more than ten years ago for our honeymoon and the hotel really wowed us that time. This time, we returned with our kids and all enjoyed it but found also room for improvement.  Pros:  - King's pond - unique, beautiful and fun. This was the biggest selling point for us picking this hotel and we all loved it.  - Plethora of other pools for kids.  - Washers/dryers on site with detergent - So convenient for a longer stay.  - Long walks on the beaches with sea turtles- my kids loved trying to spot these sea turtles. It made the stay super special.  - In general, beautiful property.    Cons:  - Internet - we booked thru Amex which promised 'free wifi' but that only gave us the entry level wifi so we had to upgrade if we wanted to stream. Given the cost of the hotel, we wished they didn't have to nick and dime its guests for something like wifi. even with the upgrade, the wifi wasn't without glitches.  - Mac and Cheese. Food in general was ok although expensive. However, I was floored that a mac and cheese my daughter had looked worse than store bought boxed Krafts. I'd have thought they'd have at least home made Mac and Cheese at this price level!  - When we checked out, the bill had errors on it that needed to be corrected.    In general though, this is still a beautiful property. There were some signs of age since our last visit but my understanding is that the hotel has updated its rooms in the last year so that shouldn't be an issue anymore. This property is such a distinguished one that we hope it will not rest on its laurels and continue to improve.",Aug 2022,September 2021,,,"New York City, New York"

851616863,50,Amazing resort in paradise. Pricey though.,"The resort is phenomenal. Staff is outstanding - everyone seemed genuinely invested in helping us out. We did have a issue with the beds in our rooms but it was handled quickly and professionally - how hotels handle the inevitable snafu says a lot about their commitment to service.    This is one of the few beach resorts I have been to where they solved the beach/pool chair problem - we never had trouble finding chairs even arriving late in day. Seems to be a combination of: having enough chairs to start with (what a novel idea!), plus staff the vigilantly clears chairs that haven’t been used in a while. The servers come by to the chairs periodically with complimentary little treats - fruit, macadamias, water, etc.    The hotel was pretty booked but never felt busy. The smart layout spreads people out and it was adequately staffed so we never had to wait for anything.    Food overall was great. The lone exception was the dinner we had at Ulu Grill - the tuna and shrimp were brutally overcooked. Maybe they were just having a bad night, as we ate breakfast several times at Ulu and it was very good.    Prices for food/beverage/etc were, as expected, pretty nuts. I get it is Hawaii plus it is the Four seasons but still. $40 for a boxed lunch with a sandwich and chips, $21 for a cocktail, $30 for an omelette, etc. Free self-parking was a nice surprise. I wouldn’t bother with the $30/day valet as they park in the same lot. But this is the kind of place where you just need to know going in that everything is expensive.    One complaint from my teens was the gym hours. Closing at 7pm seems way too early. Most hotel gyms are 24/7.    As I write this, I realize I have nitpicked quite a few things. But I am sticking with the 5-star review- despite the couple issues; the rest of the experience was just that good.",Aug 2022,August 2022,Traveled with family,,

We went to learn about Hawaiian history and the language. Both Micah and Kaulu at the center put our trip over the top. After learning about the amazing Hawaiian people and the culture they built they both put on an impromptu Hula experience with Micah on the ukulele and Kaulu performing. Both are renowned performers and it was perfect. Made my wife cry she loved it so much. If you walk past the cultural center and don’t go in you are missing one of the best parts of the resort.

The activities for kids are terrific. Everyone is so friendly. The tennis and golf facilities and staff are fantastic. I can go on and on but…I’ve never found a hotel this good. The only “negative” is that unlike, say, Wailea in Maui, it’s a decent 15+ minute drive to go anywhere else, but you never really need to leave this resort, and I don’t think the drive to Waikoloa (where we’d go for other stuff) is that bad either.

845094728,40,Beautiful resort,"This is a resort for the wealthy. No way around it and you can feel it the moment you arrive. The grounds are impeccable. The staff generally very friendly and helpful. Food very expensive- but delicious. We had a few bumps with our stay but front desk manager Mo did everything he could to make it right and emphasized he wanted service recovery to occur— I felt he really wanted to make sure we enjoyed our stay there. Notes for improvement (in my opinion) revolve around warmth/friendliness of front desk and concierge. Everywhere else staff was impeccable. I wonder if some room types allow you a personal concierge? We had an oceanfront room and I don’t know if the same person ever answered my email when trying to pre-plan. They did make dining reservations for us in advance which was a huge help. We ate at Beach tree, Ulu and Hualalai grill. Loved Beach tree— the setting on the ocean was spectacular and service top-notch. The real standout for our family was King’s pond. My kids loved snorkeling there and poolside service was excellent. We did a snorkel safari and behind the scenes tour at kings pond arranged through concierge. If I were to pick one of the two- do the behind the scenes. Great time feeding the ray and the fish with additional time exploring the “touch tank” next to the pool.

844108560,50,Simply The Best,"We simply don't have words to describe the absolutely wonderful visit to Four Seasons Hualalai in May 2022. We visited this hotel resort for lunch many years ago and always said we would like to try a stay here so when we had the opportunity over the Memorial Day Weekend we were excited to say the least. We were worried that due to the holiday it would be crowded with long wait times at restaurants. We never experienced this over our short 5 day stay. From the moment we stepped off the plane in Kona we were catered to and pampered beyond our expectations. We booked the Milo Suite which is located in the Palm Grove Crescent. The suite was beautiful with a perfect view. Our concierge, Helen, prepared our itinerary for our short 5 day stay and did a most incredible job! We ate at each of the 5 different restaurants during our stay (our favorite was Resident's Beach House) and loved each and every one of our meals. We took a helicopter tour, arranged by Helen, and saw the entire island with lava flow and different terrains. We landed on the side of a mountain and hiked down to a waterfall and back, then had lunch overlooking the ocean with the breeze blowing and Aloha Spirit surrounding us. Just magical! One of our favorite parts of this vacation was getting to know some of the employees at this resort; they are genuinely happy to work there and are so accommodating that it truly humbled us. The grounds are astounding as are the people at Hualalai and we can't wait to return!",Jun 2022,May 2022,,,
843462605,50,Perfect stay,Stayed at four season Oahu a couple years back and decided to stay on the Big island for this trip. The property is completely different from Oahu but still the same amazing experience you expect from a four. The property is much more spread out and rooms are not all in one building. Our room was right in front of the ocean by kings pond and it was absolutely stunning. To wake up each morning and open the doors to the ocean was something I will always remember. Our room had an amazing outdoor shower and not once showered using the indoor one. How could you? Great restaurants but by far my favorite was ULU absolutely phenomenal. As for activities my wife really enjoyed her time at the spa and the uniqueness of the facilities. We both booked the one wheel experience on the golf course and it was one of the best highlights of the trip. We had never one wheeled before but our guide was so patient and helpful we were flying by the end. We also snorkeled in kings pond which was nice and got to see them feed all the unique fishes. Can’t recommend this place enough. Lovely people and such a great experience from start to finish.,Jun 2022,June 2022,Traveled as a couple,,"San Francisco, California"
843307566,50,My daughter was right!,"I’ve never been a big Four Seasons fan- okay rooms and high prices! My daughter thought that the Kona 4S was the place to stay as part of a Hawaii family vacation. This property is just fabulous! It’s hundreds of acres of breathtaking scenery coupled with great accommodations and flawless service. Yes, its too expensive and the restaurant service is not the best at times. However, if you want a spectacular resort, it will be difficult to find a better one.  It’s hard to believe, but I might be becoming a Four Seasons convert!",Jun 2022,June 2022,,,
842626149,50,Our new favorite Hawaiian resort,"This place is so special. My husband and I just spent a week at this resort with our three young kids, ages 5,4, and 1. It was our first time to this resort. All five of us had an incredible time and definitely want to return in the future. We’ve stayed at other top reports in Hawaii, my favorite until this trip being the Montage in Kapalua on Maui. But FS Hualalai has now taken the title in our hearts of favorite Hawaiian resort! What really stuck out was just how luxurious it felt to have the long stretch of beach and beautiful tide pools at the resort, and how spread out everything was. We saw turtles, crabs, and so many beautiful fish. All of the many different pools each had their own character and were each loved by our crew. The spread-out two-story bungalow style is so much more enjoyable than huge housings and towers. The landscaping and gardens throughout were lush and gorgeous and meticulously kept. We also loved our outdoor shower and used it every day.    I booked a very good rate through my Tripadvisor Pro membership. I highly recommend looking at potential savings through that route. When we arrived, I asked it we could upgrade to a room closer to the family pool. They kindly gave us a great option. We had to pay a bit extra per night since what was offered was a prime ocean-front room, but it was absolutely worth it to be so close to the Sea Shell pool (main family pool) and “Ocean Pool,” particularly because of the young ages of our kids. The baby pool/beach at Seashell Pool was a huge hit!    We loved all of the restaurants there. Don’t miss Residents Beach House for lunch and Ulu for a sunset dinner. Food and drinks are, of course, expensive, but were all delicious. (We also loved The Canoe House at the Mauna Lani resort- it’s definitely worth going! Kids can run around on the lawn while you eat- like at Beachtree at FS.)    Service was generally wonderful. There were a couple of things forgotten here and there by both housekeeping and in-room dining, but they were always quick to fix the issue once notified. Mostly it was flawless and friendly. The resort was not very busy when we were there, which we appreciated.    The sports club and spa facilities were beyond beautiful. I took a great pilates and a good circuit class, and utilized the steam room and hot tub at the spa afterwards. Kids for all seasons is am amazing program. The marine life programming is superb as well. Don’t miss the fish feeding and touch tank! We also loved the guided Outrigger Canoe trip we did. It was perfect, even for young kids. We were able to jump in and snorkel off the canoe, which I wasn’t expecting. And it brings you over to Kukio beach for the canoe, which is a beautiful beach that’s not to be missed.    Hualalai truly lived up to the hype. We had such and incredible trip, and we hope to return in the future!",Jun 2022,June 2022,Traveled with family,,"Danville, California"

841885702,50,Honeymoon Vacation,"Great experience from the moment we checked in. We were taken to a couch with a welcome drink where a tour and ins and outs of the property were explained. Our room was not quite ready as we arrived earlier than the check in window, but we were upgraded and the guest services took care of all of our luggage for us while we went to have lunch by the ocean at Beach Tree. When our room was ready, guest services transported us by golf cart and we had an awesome room with a great view of the ocean by King’s Pond Pool. The room was very clean and all amenities were awesome! We were celebrating our honeymoon and greeted with a bottle of Prosecco and white truffle chocolates. During our time, the fitness facility, spa, and pools were all great experiences! We had concierge rent us a car to explore the island and this was also a seamless process. All of the meals we had were awesome, and the servers we had at Ulu were so excited to explain their expansive menu. Lilibeth was especially fun to chat with about food and she provided some great recommendations including the Misoyaki Kanpachi. Overall, this property is beautiful and very expansive. It is truly a resort that is spread out and we often found ourselves walking to our dinners at 7pm without seeing any other guest until arriving at the restaurant. We had a great time and look forward to returning in the future!",Jun 2022,May 2022,,,"Omaha, Nebraska"
841179596,50,Actual Paradise,"For our first Hawaii vacation we wanted to splurge and thought FS Hualalai would be the right choice for that. The resort definitely exceeded all of our expectations. We stayed for 6 nights and honestly wish we stayed FOREVER because the place is that special. Everything from the service, restaurants, our oceanfront room, and views (everywhere is picture perfect) were 11/10. I can't imagine coming back to Hawaii without staying at FS Hualalai now. My husband and I already can't wait to come back to this magical place.    I think what also makes this place truly special is the staff. You can tell they want to make your stay an unforgettable one. My husband and I really enjoyed getting to know some of them during our stay!    Wanted to give a special shout-out to Oji (hope that's spelled correctly) from the Hualalai Grille for giving us really amazing service for our last night at the resort. He was super accommodating and made us feel like we've been friends for years.    You will not regret staying here!!",Jun 2022,May 2022,,,

840128019,10,"One Star Service in a ""Five Star"" Resort","My wife and I booked for five nights. I’m a hot sleeper, and so without a cooling mattress pad, I cannot sleep well unless the bedroom is at or below 63 degrees F. I was told by hotel staff that their A/C system in their rooms could provide this. But after the first night it was clear the “coolest” their system could reach was 69 degrees. Even with the ceiling fan on and covered with only a sheet, I literally woke up dripping sweat. It was miserable.    The front desk suggested, of course, that I talk to engineering. And, of course, the engineer told me – in the most disdainful manner that I have ever been spoken to by anyone – that they would have to change the systems of the entire resort in order to change mine, implying that was clearly out of the question.    The bed was also extremely soft, so much so that my back went out. I asked them twice the 2nd day if they could provide a firmer mattress, which they twice refused. After desperately asking a third time, they agreed but the replacement was so hard it was actually painful to sleep on, since I’m a side sleeper.    I also dropped off two silk shirts the morning after I arrived for their “24 hour” dry cleaning service. After 34+ hours later had to call to ask why the shirts had not been returned. When they were finally returned, my black shirt had visible white spots on it (soap?), some of which I rinsed out in the sink and hand-dried with the hair dryer. When I got tired of that I called housekeeping and asked why my shirts were returned with spots on them. I was told that dismissively that there were no spots on them. So, apparently, both I and my wife were hallucinating.    After two nights I asked to check out early, in order to end this torture session. I was told that I would have to pay a penalty fee!    Keep in mind that we were paying several thousand dollars a night for this place. Service this bad is simply not worth that price. In fact it’s not worth any price.    We won’t be returning.",May 2022,April 2022,,,"Las Vegas, Nevada"
839713171,50,Four Seasons 5 star service and quality,"Excellent service is the one thing I have grown to love when staying at Four Seasons Resorts. The Hualalai did not let me down. From the moment we stepped off the airplane and were met by the airport greeter, every need was handled. Once we arrived at the resort someone was waiting for us at the entrance ushering us to the couch for a personalized check-in experience with welcome drinks waiting. We were instantly impressed with the VIP service.    My husband and I stayed 4 nights in a Deluxe Beachfront suite. The second floor offers the best views of the ocean but the first-floor units have easier access to the pools due to the walkout patio. My preference was the 2nd floor to enjoy looking out over the water. We stayed in the Beach Tree crescent and after visiting the other pools, we liked our pool the best. It's the biggest and is deemed the quiet pool. This means, no splashing, no swimming laps, and rowdy/loud people are not permitted. Perfect for our style to relax and take in the ocean breezes.    The resort grounds are beautiful and so unique. Built on a lava field with plenty of lava rock used throughout the property pathways, golf course and outdoor showers. My husband and I commented on the variety of trees, flowers, plants, etc... Simply beautiful gardens everywhere you look.    Throughout our stay, we enjoyed the attention to detail from every department. The turn-down service always made sure our room was refreshed and ready for the evening replenishing our ice, water bottles, stemware, towels, etc... One evening, they noticed my sunglasses were dirty so a lens cleaner was left under my glasses (very thoughtful). The pool team always made sure we had what we needed and were very attentive to everyone. The housekeeping staff came through for us when we needed a rain poncho last minute but couldn't find one in any onsite shops. They miraculously found one for us the night before we needed it for an early morning tour the following day.    My one and only complaint about this report is the spa design and how most of the couple's relaxation areas and massage rooms are completely outdoors. It was too hot for us to enjoy a massage outdoors. Luckily one of the rooms with A/C was available so we had our treatment there instead. I realize most people enjoy the outdoor massage but it wasn't for us. Just thought I would share that bit of info for future travelers to make an informed decision before scheduling an appointment.

The room itself is very true to the pics you see online. I went right after spring break and thought things we pretty peaceful and quiet. Not a lot of screaming kids by any means.    Some useful tips that may help others that I didn’t see in other reviews: the room has reusable metal water bottles that guests can refill at these little huts in front of their rooms. The hut also has free to use washer & dryer machines along with tide pods, etc.    The fitness center has many machines and airy areas to use them in, with good ventilation for COVID precautions.    A rental car is a must if you want to see the further away areas of the island like the volcanoes national park or Mauna Kea . I saw that Uber did have cars nearby though, so that could work for shorter trips.

The rooms weren't huge but quiet, and I think all rooms have a view of the beach, at least the second floor. We spent lots of time sitting on the balcony just enjoying the view. There were lots of pools, so nothing seemed very crowded. We did the onsite snorkel, which was also different and interesting. All of the food was great, but expect to spend at least $50 per person per meal. We spent $100 on french toast and a breakfast burrito.

836973940,50,The best resort in Hawaii at any price,"My wife and I have been to Hawaii several times now, and I really can't imagine visiting Hawaii without a stay at Hualalai. No other resort offers this combination of service, setting, quality of facilities, and serenity. Yes, it is expensive and I understand that it is a bit of a splurge to stay here for a lot of travelers, including myself, but if you are on the fence at all you will not regret choosing to stay at the Four Seasons.    When we arrived we were warmly welcomed with leis and fruit juice before the bellman drove us to our room on a cart and helped us with all of our luggage. The room has a modern feel to it with touches of Hawaiian influence throughout. You could see the ocean from our room, making for a beautiful view. There is a chromecast connected to the TV which is nice if you like to watch something other than regular TV.    The resort itself is fantastic. There are several pools, each with a unique setup and vibe. We never had issues finding a chair at the pool. The golf course was in immaculate condition. There were no ball marks on the greens, all of the tee boxes were perfectly level with perfect turf, and the fairways were in great shape.    The only thing to be mindful of is that the resort is fairly remote. The nearest town/shopping/restaurant that is not on the resort is a 20-30 minute drive in either direction. This was not an issue for us, as there is plenty to do on the resort and we liked the on-site restaurants as well as the general sense of seclusion that you have while on property, but if you plan on exploring other areas, just make note of this during planning.    The thing that really sets the Four Seasons above other resorts is the service. Throughout our entire stay, every time we needed something there was a friendly face there to help. They really do go above and beyond here and provide hands down the best service we have received at any resort. We never had to wait for help with chairs at the pool or to make a food/drink order, the golf staff was incredibly friendly, and there are regularly people walking the resort refilling water, offering popsicles or smoothie samples, or even to clean your sunglasses. The staff really do make you feel like you personally are the most important guest at all times, and this is ultimately what will keep us coming back for years to come.",May 2022,April 2022,,,

834863176,50,Amazing stay on the Big Island,"Such a beautiful property with excellent food, service, and of course a stunning location! We travelled from the UK to stay here for 10 days and loved it. The four pools each have a unique ambience and means there is somewhere for everyone. King’s Pond is amazing, and the new infinity pool is gorgeous.  We enjoyed all four of the restaurants and it’s difficult to pick a favourite but the Residents’ Beach House probably just wins!  The only problem (during a very busy spring break week) was the lack of clear policy over reserving sun beds. In my opinion, it might be better to simply prohibit people from being able to reserve beds until they’ve finished breakfast. But whatever the policy, there should be clear signs and staff should be confident in enforcing the rules. It’s a shame to see people arguing about sun beds in such a high end hotel.

The resort was beautiful, and the rooms and grounds were even more beautiful in person. The crescent design is ingenious, with pools for each traveler’s interest. The Sea Shell Pool and the new infinity pool atop King’s Pond were favorites with our kids, and we greatly enjoyed snorkeling in the Ocean Pool and King’s Pond. Kids for All Seasons was a hit with our 6 and 8 year olds. We were also impressed with the dining – we had multiple meals at Beach Tree and Ulu. We usually tire of resort fare after a few days, but that was not the case at this property – the restaurants were quite good. Though expensive, I found this FS to be a fair value for the quality and relaxation.

A few highlights for our family were: the walking trail every morning, snorkeling in the ocean in front of the resort and seeing sea turtles, the spa if incredible (Carol in particular!), my son fell in love with tennis and loved his lessons, dinner watching the sunset and the Luau was so so fun and delicious! Few tips: Get a bottom floor room if you want the outdoor shower - which is awesome; book dinners in advance for the sunset time; we went to the trading post ALOT for snacks, lunch and breakfasts; bring some cash as you will want to tip the pool/beach staff because they are great; go to the spa!

The staff, especially the Concierges, could not have been nicer. The rooms are spacious and most face the ocean (although the top floors are the ones that view the ocean - still the lower ones are often set in gardens just a few steps from the pools and ocean.

Four Seasons does not ""package"" the place or bring in tour groups at a discount. The people who do come here can well afford it and it shows. You never hear any complaints, and what they pay for food and drinks -- they couldn't care less. Some arrive in their own jets, bringing their families and hired help along as well. This is how ""the other half"" live and they enjoy it. The hotel is well-staffed and guests are treated exceedingly well. One suggestion is to call well in advance to make restaurant reservations.

831464073,30,A Private Country Club Ownership Development With an Incidental Hotel on Property,"A truthful description of the Four Seasons hotel on the Big Island of Hawaii is hotel rooms situated within the country club facilities that belong to hundreds of property owners at Hualalai.    This reality, however, is not at all apparent from the marketing materials directed at would-be vacationers. The resort is a huge development with hundreds of homes in neighborhoods that border the golf courses, surrounded by lava rock walls and electrified fences. To get an idea of the size, the drive from the highway down to the ocean and where the hotel rooms and resort facilities are located is probably a mile or more.    If you don’t mind being the interloper at someone else’s country club, then you may love it here. But If spending your vacation in the weekend playground of wealthy owners and their families is not your idea of a vacation, then look elsewhere.    Although there are only about 230 hotel rooms here, don’t expect peace and quiet or solitude. Every day there is an influx of residents using the resort facilities, so you will be in competition for restaurant reservations, pool chairs, spa appointments, etc. And please be aware that, while the protocols may be subtle, the residents get priority over hotel guests. There definitely is a hierarchy at this resort, and you will be at the bottom.    Speaking of being low on the totem pole here, we discovered two insulting and undisclosed policies aimed at us, mere hotel guests. We paid in full for our 11-night stay last summer, so the hotel had our money for months ahead of our arrival. We gave them our credit card for incidentals at check-in. Nevertheless, we were informed by voicemail on day six that our folio would be charged to our credit card on the following day. Our folio consisted primarily of charges for food and drink in the resort, which adds up fast when a cup of diet coke is $7 and a cocktail is $25. This was very insulting to us that they were concerned we might not have the money to pay our bill at the end. Later, on the tenth day, our keys were deactivated despite having another pre-paid night. The front desk agent explained that all keys are deactivated on the tenth day. This is apparently another undisclosed tactic used by the management to force the guest to come to the office to be confronted with the folio. No other hotel has ever treated us with this undeserved level of suspicion that we might bolt without paying the bill. Why were we targeted for surveillance? We arrived with heavy bags and no rental car. Our 11 nights were pre-paid. We did not order exorbitant champagne or shop in the jewelry store and charge huge expenses to our account--just ate in their restaurants. We were polite and quiet guests. Our credit card was in their hands with a huge amount of free credit. Just dumbfounded. Maybe it was because we are from flyover country? Because we had not stayed at Four Seasons before? No clue but we left with a very bad taste in our mouth.    And I must discuss the situation with kids at this resort. Often with little or no supervision, kids roam around the resort facilities where the hotel is located. They and their parents act like the resort is their own back yard, which it basically is for the property owners. The most disruptive and annoying situations occur on the beach around the restaurants. Parents sit in the open-air restaurants sipping drinks while they allow their kids to run back and forth from the table to the beach out front. This is very disruptive to the hotel guest who just wants to have a peaceful dinner enjoying the sunset. Our last dinner was ruined by the view of a small girl disrobing and relieving herself in the sand across from our table, while her family at a table above us watched her and laughed and did absolutely nothing about her terrible behavior.    I also need to warn the hotel guest who is considering a premium oceanfront room: if you expect to have nothing but sand or landscaping between your patio and the ocean, like at most resorts, you will be disappointed. The reality is that there is a paved walkway that runs the length of the resort between all resort facilities and the ocean. This pathway is the main thoroughfare for the resort and is heavily traveled by people on foot and by workers in golf cart vehicles at all hours. People walking by have a direct view of your patio and into your room if you don’t close the shutters. There is no privacy. All premium oceanfront means at this resort is that you have a room closest to the ocean compared to all the rest of the rooms, but you still have obstacles between you and the ocean and no more direct access to the beach than anyone else.    The property itself is lovely and well cared for. Individual front-line staff gave us good service and were very polite. Housekeeping was good, except they could not remember to leave extra wash cloths or sun towels for our chaise loungers. Food and drink were very very expensive, and only really good in the restaurant Ulu. The rest, nothing to write home about. Room service food was just ok although prompt. The beach and pool attendants were very attentive.    But overall, we were second class citizens at this ownership resort. We resent having been treated by the management as potential skippers, and we were appalled at the lack of manners and the lack of appropriate socialization of some of the rich children on the property.    And one final comment. Half of the over-the-chair beach towels had holes in them, which is really out of character for a place with the reputation of the Four Seasons.    My overall service ranking is for the front-line staff.

Even with issues associated with COVID the service and attention to detail were more than we could have hoped for.    My husband was interested in learning more about the beach area. Onsite Marine Biologists told us about the beach area and the hotel's dedication to protecting the environment. We enjoyed a swim in the lagoon.

It is just beautiful. feel very safe with respect to Covid precautions. Staff is fantastic. Highly recommend snorkeling in the Kings pond and booking an eco-tour with the marine experts. We were two adults and completely enjoyed our time, but we could see where this would be a good family friendly resort as well (but not at all disturbing if you are only adults). We stayed in room 2504, which was like having our own direct beach bungalow. We slept every night with the doors open and listen to the water. Not a single mosquito. The surf was very high the week we were there, but the ocean pool was still spectacular. This resort delivers across the board.

823173456,50,Impressive,"We travelled as a family of four with two young kids 5 and 3. The property is awesome in pretty much every way. Several great pools, immaculate grounds, great restaurants, excellent service.    The Kings Pond pool is really a one-of-a-kind experience. We did it every day during our stay. Such an awesome intro to snorkeling for young kids. There are a ton of different fish to see. We also attended the feeding of the Eagle ray one afternoon which was also cool. Try to go at 10am when it opens as the water is most clear at this time before the algae blooms later in the day.    One thing to know- the beach here is not world class. It's fine but if you're expecting Wailea or Hapuna, you'll be disappointed There are a lot of areas or large volcanic rock on the beach that were actually pretty fun for the kids to explore.    Once minor gripe- even the outdoor restaurants require masks to go from the hostess to your table. I realize it's a resort policy but come on. Such a waste of masks and completely worthless covid theater. But I realize that's the world we live in.    Overall, this place lives up to the hype and is worth the money.",Dec 2021,November 2021,,,Iowa
822782596,50,Best Resort Stay in Hawaii in last 30 yrs!,"From beginning to end, our stay at The Four Seasons was flawless.    Napua checked us in and made suggestions for our overnight stay based on the amenities offered. Keanu took us on a short property tour before taking our luggage to our room.    I know the holidays are a very busy time. Nonetheless, your staff took the time to honor my request for a room with an outdoor shower. And the room was perfect!    Jessa helped us with last minute dinner reservations at Ulu’s. Lauren, one of the onsite the marine biologists and her “Junior Assistant,” Poppy updated us on the variety of fish in King’s Pond and told us about the hotel’s conservation measures and the fisheries supplying oysters and other delicacies to your restaurants.    Natalie and Craig helped us find lounge seating and explained more about Kainalu, the Spotted Eagle Ray, Bullet and some of the other ocean pond inhabitants making a simple swim more of an educational experience.    Paul, our very gregarious and friendly steward brought breakfast to our room Saturday morning. And now your events staff is helping us plan a dinner for 12 in February.

822778778,50,A haven in heaven,"We spent 10 days here for our honeymoon. How do we love the Four Seasons Hualalai? Let me count the ways:  1) The app. Communication with the Four Seasons concierge and team were excellent. Download it and use the messenger - it is great!  2) The location. Hualalai is other worldy, carved into a lava field that meets the Pacific with small but usable and private white sand beaches (a bit rocky). Landscaping is very sympathetic and gives a luxurious, verdant feel. Sunsets off the beach. Gorgeous!  3) Wildlife. We saw whales breaching, spinner dolphins jumping and spinning (more than a hundred), coutless birds.....  4) Food. Ulu and Beach Tree are outstanding. Even the food delivered to your lounger is tip top. Few resorts can match the food quality found here!  5) Pools. Something for everyone. NEVER felt crowded even though property was pretty much full. Never hard to get a lounger. No need to ""reserve"" with an early morning towel.  6) King's Pond. This gazillion gallon, trillion fish pond feels natural and has handsome infinity pools and hot tubs carved in the borders. Can snorkel and swim in it at your leisure. Kings Pond is a uniquely natural experience for experience. As a tip, consider reserving a Ocean View Deluxe room, these look onto the King's Pond and to the ocean.  7) Activities. If you are bored here, you should do some soul searching. On site activities include the pools, beaches, hikes, spa, lap pool, gym, boules, outrigger canoeing, SUPs, golf, tennis......... Off site is all the Big Island has to offer (helicopter tours (Blue Hawaii five star outfit), scuba diving (night manta dive, omg), Mauna Kea summit (Mauna Kea Summit Adventures were excellent) and Volcanoes National Park to name some highlights.  8, 9, 10) The staff!!

Everything was outstanding, the property, the staff, the room, the food, the golf course. I've read some negative reviews and all I can say is people love to complain I swear.....they complain about prices mostly, but if money is an issue you shouldn't stay at a Four Seasons! There were times when we had no business staying at a Four Season or like resort, but we are now fortunate to be able to do so. Trust me, plan with in your budget and where ever you go you will enjoy, but if have the ability to come to this resort, do it, appreciate it, and count your blessings!!

822385455,20,Unethical,"My parents stayed in the property for 2 nights. They just check-out today. They told me ridiculous story, the first night they were there, around 10:30pm, they were all sleeping. Someone knock on their door, they didn’t open the room because they were deeply asleep. But the knocking still going and woke them up. When my dad was going to open the door, a man entered their room!!!!! He freak them out, a stranger came in their room in the middle of the night when they were half asleep. On the second night, when my mom was on the shower, someone knock on their door again. My dad didn’t hear the knock for quite sometime and it happened again, someone was inside the room again. They thought they were hotel staff. It’s extremely inappropriate for hotel staff to come inside the room at night. Doesn’t matter what the reason was!

822366499,50,Excellence from start to finish,"We have stayed in many Four Seasons properties and 5-star resorts around the world and can say this one is truly excellent. We spent six nights there and for the first four, literally never left the property. We had an ocean view suite by the King's Pool and fish viewing pond and really loved the location -- there was good people watching but quiet at night as the pools close as sunset.    The room: incredible attention to design detail and both the outdoor shower and inside steam room/shower got much use. Extremely well designed and appointed.    The service: excellent room service that arrived literally to the minute on time, every time. High quality food and great coffee (we preferred the regular coffee over the french press FWIW).    The restaurants: slightly mixed. Ulu ocean grill provided some great meals and service and also a bad sushi evening. Beach tree cafe was reliably good. The steakhouse in the golf club needs help: kind of like being in a Marriott that needs renovation (although the food was excellent). In all cases, there are options to be seated outside with view to the ocean, in which case you don't see the people behind you.    The property; Three visits to the spa and mostly loved it. The best were some of the body wraps by partner and I did - highly recommend. The cellular rejuvenation facial was good but breathtakingly expensive. The pools are all different in character so check them all out and see which you like the best. Do take advantage of the snorkeling on site to see cool fish and a spotted ray in the easiest of settings. And, we swam every day in the ocean in a protected area in front of Ulu Ocean Grill.    Last tip: Splurge on a private dinner on the beach. We did this to celebrate my partner's 60th birthday and it was magic from start to finish - the team at the Four Seasons really knocked it out of the park.",Dec 2021,December 2021,,We found first floor rooms to be better than second floor -- you have more of a patio and full...,"Chicago, Illinois"

819193846,50,Absolutely Stunning!,This is the most beautiful resort we have ever been to. From the moment you got off the plane and the car service takes your bags we knew we were in good hands with the Four Seasons staff. Attention to every detail is something that comes up when I tell friends about our trip. Everything we needed or asked for was taken care of promptly and with a smiling engaging staff member.    Room - Our room was incredible. It was absolutely beautiful and had everything we needed. Our room had the outdoor shower. We never used the indoor shower! The rooms are large and the closet is amazing! The staff kept our room spotless and gave us bottled water every day!    Property - The property is perfect! I don’t know how they do it but it is absolutely stunning from every angle!    Food - We loved every meal and drink we had at the Beach Tree and ULU! We also loved the room service breakfasts!    Staff - While we were staying at the Four Seasons Hualalai we had the opportunity to meet and speak with many of the staff members. They not only take so much pride in making your time with them special. They are such a joy to be around. Every staff member was extremely professional and attentive! We didn’t want for anything.    Surfing - My husband and I both surf And couldn’t come to Hawaii and not surf. Prior to our visit the Four Seasons recommended Kona Town Surf Adventures. We booked 2 semi-private sessions and loved ever minute! I can’t say how easy it was. We showed up and were handed two waxed boards and within minutes we were in the water. It was safe and fun and It was the perfect set up. By having Matt (our instructor) we didn’t have to worry about where to be or which wave to take! It couldn’t have been any better!

Book as far in advance as you can so you can pick your date and time. They are very busy.  Make sure to book the Manta Ray at night experience. Unbelievable!!  Also, we loved the canoe - nice to get out there on the ocean.  We spent most meals on our own patio - since it was the best view possible. Room service is excellent.  We rented a car for the day and it was wonderful to have it delivered and ready to go. Very easy.  The beach chairs are readily available and the service on the beach was excellent.

815916307,40,Amazing property,"This place, this place, this place. ah-mazing  From the start where we had four seasons greeters waiting for us and taking out bags to the cab, I knew we were in for a real treat. We initially had issues with our room selection due to the special occasion. After siting around the room waiting for available options we ended up staying in room 401 which is a downstairs room at kings pond. What I like about the kings pond rooms is unlike all the other rooms, kings pond rooms are stepped back from the pool and isnt easily accessible from the outside sitting area. Some people will like it and others won't, but its good to know. Also even though the kings pond is popular it wasn't ever crowded with kids or adults. What also helps is that the snorkeling is only available from 10-4, so a lot of people due the snorkeling and then leave. I'm also bias since we stayed at the kings pond room but the views there are unmatched. During the day we spent most of our days at the adult only pool because of the swimup bar but if you stayed in that section you would see a smallish pool and a nice green area where people can lay on the grass an relax.    Food:  ULU  Its the restaurant for breakfast. Its your basic continental with the option of buffet or ala cart. It was ok, nothing to write home about, but quick tip the egg station makes all different versions of egg styles with add ons so get your scrambled there.    lunch/dinner  the nigiri- amazing  our favorite item ended up being the tomato and avocado salad, perfectly balanced    I had the curry with chicken. It was so-so and the chicken looked like it had no seasoning. She had the puna chicken, it was much better    Beachtree  the pepperoni pizza was ok  So was the brick chicken    Kings pond:  Best burger between the pools    Dinner by the stars:  multiple courses oh amazingness. Everything that was made was just the best thing you'd ever taste, and it had to be because you're paying for it lol. The attention to detail was nice. I used this moment to propose, and it was everything and more. It was to the point that every day after the meal almost everyone at the resort recognized me for proposing lol. If you do it i recommend the band. They play mostly Hawaiian music but i went with the mood perfectly. Our private waiter wen above and beyond, he was just great. For example it was super windy that day and when we took pictures he grabbed our champagne and anything else on the table and put it away so it doesn't blow off or get sand in.  Chef love was amazing. He even came and briefly talked to us at the beach. And every time we went to ULU he would come give us a quick chat before heading back. Great guy, and better chef.    omkase:  I see why there's a waiting list. Look whatever you need to do, just get a reservation. Chef Nuri fantastic. One of the coolest dudes there.    Pools:  We mainly stayed at the kings pong pool and the adult only pool.  Kings pond pool was amazing, Not very big bu you can look down into the kings pond and watch people snorkel or even get glimpses of the sea life. Adding that there are some great seats that aren't just your standard deck lounger with a canopy. There are some great seats that are at the edge of the kings pond where you can really sea the fish. The snorkeling is great if you're a first timer or don't regularly snorkel. The water is very calm and my advice to people who haven't snorkeled before, Have a buddy system and start off on the side closer to the ocean, its not as deep and narrow from end to end. It will help with your confidence to swim to he deeper end and make any mask adjustments . After a couple minuted you""ll forget how deep the pool really is and have an amazing time.    adult only pool:  We probably stayed there until they closed. What sets this pool apart is the on site bar. Were every other pool will have a short wait for the restaurants to make a group of orders and to be transported to the pool area. I cannot remember he bartenders name but he was amazing, to the point that no mater what day i came all I had to do was look at him and he'd have my usual drink order in the works. There was another bartender, he was not great to the point where no one wanted to order drinks because he was so slow.    Room:  great  the outside shower draws you in everytime. It was beautiful, it had a nice touch with the shelf next to the door where you can leave the card keys, very convenient. The window shades look great for the room but weren't practical. They didn't really close all the way so there is light peaking through in the morning. Great for morning people but it you're sleeping in, there will be light. Also the bed was very firm, not as plush like some fs properties. and those pillows can't be the same fs pillows because, just no. Huge tv if you want to turn it on with a nice amount of channels.    Service: Its a fs property, service shouldn't be a question and here it wasn't. everyone was great and made you feel at home. Special shout out to Suzie with the pool staff, i loved her, great personality. I can't remember the black guys name at the kings pond but yes you were right the last episode of ""what if"" was amazing, thanks for no spoilers. And i want to say i think everyone in the resort the loved the guy who walks around with the macadamia nut and popsicles. He was so nice and remembered conversations you had with him and i felt very genuine.    Only issues:  I want to say Jason who checked us in did everything in his power to make us happy with our room selection. He even personally drove us to each room for us o see. Service top notch. But i will say they did put him in a difficult situation when they gave us a room near the sea shell pool and the hotel not having a lot of available rooms. It was known about the engagement and I thought we wouldn't be put smack dab at kids pool central    I informed them prior to coming to the property that I was getting engaged on the property. Whats waiting for us in our room, a gift with a card saying ""congrats on the engagement"". Luckily i was first in the room    A major issue I had with the dinner by the stars group was communication. It started with agreeing with the chef consultation time slot. I believe we agreed on 4:30pm. I agreed, informing them my flight lands around 4:00. Since I've never been to the island didn't know if that wasn't enough time but they never said that would be an issue so didn't think twice. Once we get on the property and after the issues with the rooms were handled i see that its past our appointment time. There was no communication on where i go for the consultation or who I talk to. I informed Jason and he told me who to call. I called multiple times and left an email with ZERO reply. The next day which is the day of the dinner I get to the point that i have to have concierge call and leave a voicemail to get any sort of reply. Finally someone calls me and tells me the chef will call me at 3pm. I agree, forgetting i have a massage ending at 3pm. So i call back, no answer. So again i call concierge to tell them to move the time to 3:30pm. That amount of stress i could do without    Sea of candles: $350 for around 30 Walmart candles.

I wanted a Haku (flower crown) to wear on my birthday so I sent a note to the concierge via chat to enquire where I could procure one. They sent it to my room before my birthday dinner! When we weren't doing activities we mostly lounged at the sanctuary pool and sipped on craft cocktails while the attentive staff was always making sure we had everything we needed.

Washer/dryer and ice right next door. iPad that you use to text questions, request room service or anything else you need. Very convenient! Ocean front beach cabanas and snorkeling equipment without charge. No self parking fee. Pools and the pool staff are AMAZING! Always keeping your ice water full and making sure your comfortable. The protected beach was great for snorkeling and turtle watching. Restaurants on site were less than I expected. If your going to spend some money on a night out for dinner drive somewhere else.

HOWEVER, it is beyond the word expensive and I think they are just gouging people for rooms here now (October 2021). Thank heavens we are in an ocean front suite, but we paid through the roof for this room! Also, when you pay as much as we did, you don't expect to have noisy people on top of you (meaning on the second floor) and you don't expect construction. It was kinda slimy that the Four Seasons notified us only 1 week out of our stay that they had construction (so there was no way to cancel as they have a 30 day cancellation policy). The property is nice for sure. No complaints. Plenty of pools, which is great. The ""Kings pond"" is also really cool because you can snorkel in it and see a wonderful array of fish. They also have a small, protected cove area for littles which i think is great. I think what gives it from receiving 5 stars is not only is the price just crazy...but for what we paid it should be a lot better room.",Oct 2021,October 2021,,Make sure you know EXACTLY where your room is as it does make a huge difference noise/view wise,Silicon Valley
813180691,40,"Beautiful property, close to five stars","Just back from visit, in some ways I wish I could give full 5 stars. Some aspects are above and beyond - the pools and resort itself are absolutely gorgeous. Lounging by the pool (Palm Grove and King's Pond were our favorites) was a delightful way to spend a day with excellent service from the respective pool staffs. The ocean ""pool"" was great, one day two sea turtles swam by us while we were in it, another day a large silver blue fish jumped out of the water right next to my husband and we tracked the fish's jumping all the way down the length of the ocean pool, really a joyful experience.    We had an oceanfront 1st floor room in the seashell pool section. We loved our room, very tastefully decorated, the outdoor shower had great hot water and water pressure (not always the case in an outdoor shower) and our walk out patio had lovely views. We had breakfast delivered there every morning and enjoyed watching the resort come to life every morning.    I had a dental emergency while there and the concierge staff got messages out that night to a few local dentists, followed up first thing in the morning and had an appointment for me at a good dentist in Kona within 12 hours of my tooth breaking. They went above and beyond, super impressed with them.    So why not a full 5 stars? We had a few service issues that were awkward. I'd chalk it up to training as staff certainly has been challenged this last year, but they did occur and are reflected. Also, the food at the resort was average to good, not excellent. There were a few standouts, some nigiri at U'lu was excellent, the burgers by the pool were excellent, breakfast malasadas were divine, but overall not up to the caliber I'd expected. We didn't pick up our rental car until the day we were leaving for our second resort, I wish I'd done it sooner to drive out to other restaurants and experience life beyond the resort food wise.

We recently booked the hotel but I was very concerned that things may have changed given a number of negative reviews. After spending a few days here we can assure you that the resort is nothing short of outstanding. The service is perfect, the renovated rooms are amazing and the grounds are possibly the best in the world. I have no idea what those negative reviews were about.

Some of the negative reviews I read before I came almost had me cancel (didn’t want to pay the cost of 5stars and not feel the service and the value). I am glad I didn’t. The property is amazing, the rooms gorgeous and recently renovated, there is plenty of room to spread out and we felt safe and comfortable with the masking guidelines in effect. The service is still top notch - from the fast responses to questions on the app, to bellman, to the towel/water providers (France at the beach tree exudes Aloha), the waitstaff (always around, rarely a wait), the women in the boutiques, Arlen who comes around to clean sunglasses or offer a popcicle, Carolina at the beach house, Michael at the King Pond who dug out the last snorkel for a friend who wanted to swim with the fish before she departed, cara in reservations who helped me move to a room that was a better fit for my stay. Amazing. Despite labor shortages, likely new staff who had to quickly learn hualalai’s ways, despite worries of their own about safety and Covid and all the rest. Book and enjoy.

808134029,50,Another incredible stay,"We had been wanting to come back here ever since we left last time. There is something magical about this place. We stayed for a week in a suite at the Palm Grove (adult) pool.    First off the rooms are incredible. After a complete renovation they are stunning. Each room has a large patio to relax during the day. Nearly every room has an ocean view.    The golf course was also updated to be more friendly to the average golfer. We did not play this visit but the course always looks amazing!    The pools on property are awesome. The Palm Grove pool is adults only and has a swim up bar. Great views of the ocean from the infinity end. The main pool is perhaps the most stunning setting on the island. Wonderful pool with free cabanas and lots of loungers. Please do arrive early as chairs get booked up. Then there is a kids pool. Finally the newest, and perhaps most incredible pool, at Kings Pond. This was just finished this year and is a wonderful infinity pool overlooking both the pond ( a massive ocean water aquarium that you can swim or snorkel in) and the ocean. Service at all the pools were very good. You can also swim in a protected area with beach. Always turtles swimming around which is great.    Plenty of options to lounge at the extensive beach as well. All with food and drink service. Lots of options to do nothing all day!    We ate lunch at the various pools. Each pool has a specific menu but you can order from other pools if you'd like. The fish sandwich at the Kings Pond pool takes the cake. The fish tacos at the main pool were great. The hamburger just ok. Lobster roll was excellent.    We had room service a few times as well. Easy to order from the iPad in the room and eating on the balcony was wonderful.    The Grille at the golf course was a wonderful steak focused meal. Nice wine list as well. Perhaps our favorite meal was at the Residents Beach house. Wonderful setting on the beach, great service, and tasty options.    We also did massages at the spa and they were incredible. We get regular massages back home but these were significantly better. The spa overall is wonderful.    One nice perk they don't advertise is the free washer and dryers located in each building. Pods and dryer sheets too.    The stay was not without its issues. The food was excellent at nearly all of the restaurants and pools. Ulu however remains a mystery. We had an excellent breakfast there but then 2 dinners where most people did not like their entrees. This is the signature restaurant of the property and the prices are very high. Perhaps they are going through a transition. Housekeeping was also a bit of a letdown, but after speaking with them they were back on track.    Overall a wonderful stay and we can not wait to return again.",Sep 2021,August 2021,,,"Minneapolis, MN"
803770701,50,Paradise in a time of pandemic,"We have visited Hualalai many times pre-pandemic and now twice during the pandemic and believe the resort has done an amazing job maintaining the essence of what makes this one of the most sought after vacation spots in the world. The grounds are perfect. Not a grass or flower out of place. The room renovations are warm and inviting, quietly sophisticated yet not too delicate for families with boisterous children. The aloha spirit is alive and well from the security guards at the gate welcoming us back from a walk with ice cold water bottles, to valet attendants who remembered the names of family members and always greeted us with a smile. The resort was packed when we visited and stayed in a rental home in April and was still full when we visited the hotel in August, yet the staff is still good natured and did everything possible to make our experience feel cozy and intimate. Housekeeping was perfect and thorough twice a day. Camp Manitou was a godsend and accomodated our son on short notice - with staff that recognized and welcomed him from prior years’ visits. The remaining construction was contained and quiet. Were there challenges? Yes. Did I mention we are in a pandemic? The front desk staff was professional but reserved and not as joyful as the bellmen and waitresses. The restaurants, with the exception of Resident’s Beach House, would benefit from menu refreshes and much deeper wine and cocktail lists. Management ought to consider hosting a daily cocktail hour with invites for newly arrived guests or reaching out in a more personalized way a day or so into guests’ stay in light of covid.

803438911,20,Still here and completely underwhelmed,"This hotel has a massive reputation. Here is what I’ve observed so far. The food is not better than an airport food court. Seriously. It costs 5 to 10 times as much, but will be the same in quality as your garden variety LAX meal. The hotel is completely understaffed. It takes an hour to get a drink by the pool and some of the staff you ask will openly say that you need to wait because if they put an order in it won’t matter. It’s a nice property for sure, but you will want to eat and drink while you are here, and the quality level based on what we’ve seen will make you want to cry when you realize what you’ve paid.

802002816,30,Gorgeous property but poor service,"We stayed at this resort in 2 rooms as a family for 6 nights.    Property: Absolutely gorgeous! Loved our walks along the ocean & lava rock pools, past the villas. Green & beautifully maintained with abundance of flowers.    Rooms: The prime ocean view rooms were okay - nothing gorgeous about them & we felt were below par - compared to other properties we have stayed in.    Lava rock bath: looks pretty ordinary at first but taking a bath here is an experience. The baths are partially covered & it’s awesome taking a shower in filtered sunlight amidst chirping of birds in the morning. Evening showers feel like you are in a rain forest.    View of rooms: one of our rooms was on second floor with a balcony & the view was pretty. The view from the first/ ground floor was okay - nothing great.    Housekeeping: Not good at all. The rooms were well cleaned only one day during our stay, a day before we left. The other days it was pretty bad. Used cups & glasses were not taken away or replaced & we had to repeatedly call. The shower gel bottle in the bath was broken & we had to call too. These minor things may be common at other hotels but when we stay in Four Seasons we expect the value for the money spent. The towels look a little worn out too.    Breakfast: Standard, no wow factor. Service at breakfast is pretty bad, the servers are all over the place & there are delays in bringing in orders. The fruit & pastry section needs additional servers as there may be waits.    Restaurants: We enjoyed the food at BeachTree, both lunch & dinner menu/ food is pretty good although limited. The waiting staff is excellent, very professional & Frank is a gem, full of empathy & very professional.  We were not crazy about the food at Ulu although the waiting staff is excellent. It’s pricier but we have had higher quality of food at that price.    Once during our afternoon walk we asked for a bottle of water from Beach Tree & was provided one for $9! We don’t mind paying but this seemed a bit much!    Beach: loved the beach specially the huge lava rock pool. The water is warm & you can swim. In the pool areas & beach, there is room for everyone - it’s so expansive. Our kids thoroughly enjoyed snorkeling in the lava rock pool, teeming with fish. Almost every day we saw sea turtles swimming there. The beach cabanas, twin loungers are awesome & the beach staff is just super.    Pls use water shoes if you decide to step into the tiny rock pools as there are hidden sea urchins.    Concierge: We had a medical emergency during our stay. Security with medical equipment arrived within 15 mins, EMT soon after & nurse Julie (a sweet caring professional) made a room visit. However a family member had to be taken to the hospital for chk up & IV. The concierge called a cab for me(due to covid regulations I was not able to accompany in the ambulance), they were unable to provide any resort car. The drive is 45mins. I sat in the parking lot of the hospital for 8 hrs, the cab driver was kind enough to sit with me. The concierge just told me the cab driver would have all details of the hospital & return info. That was all. Imagine being in a strange place with no support - I have never felt so alone. Returned around 12:30/ 1 am & even next day no one from the front desk or concierge chkd. Sone resorts have a heart some are completely indifferent/ money oriented.    Luau: The resort organizes lovely luaus & dinner in a gorgeous amphitheater. We loved the interactive performance. Chk out the menu when you book & ask for replacements if you do not eat something. The performers are great & the setting perfect.    Plan a trip to the caldera - the surreal landscape there is worth seeing. If possible use Kalani tours & ask for PJ. He makes this long day tour interesting.",Aug 2021,August 2021,Traveled with family,,
801861308,20,"Was it worth $25,000?","We were excited to vacation again after a year of COVID quarantine. We chose Four Seasons Hualalai as our first vacation spot after COVID. We’ve been here before (read my previous review) and had an amazing experience the last time around. However, after spending $25,000+ for our 6 night stay here, we left feeling really disappointed and unhappy with our experience.    Our experience this time was much different from our last and it has to do with inconsistency and lack of service, which is not what you would expect from a five star hotel. As soon as we were being checked in, things already felt different. The front desk staff was professional but wasn’t friendly and didn’t make us feel welcomed.    Room:  The hotel has 2 versions of their oceanfront suite. A lower level option and an upper level option. The lower level option has a large outside terrace, which makes the outdoor area a lot more spacious than the upper level option. However, the downside is that the view of the ocean is more obscured and not truly oceanfront. The upper level oceanfront suite has a true oceanfront view and the view is unobstructed but the outdoor balcony is small and narrow.    We booked the oceanfront suite and for the first few nights we stayed in the lower level suite and it was spacious and the view was decent, but I would not say the lower level room is a true oceanfront suite as there is a walkway right in front of the outside terrace and the room is actually quite far back from the ocean. In addition, every night you see couples having romantic candlelight dinners in front of your supposedly paid unobstructed oceanfront view. We’ve inquired about eating there ourselves since there were limited dining options, but they were unable to accommodate.    Another issue with the lower level suite is that we found 3 dead and 1 live cockroach during our stay there. We had to call the front desk on multiple occasions to clean up or kill the cockroaches. Yes, I understand that we are on a tropical island, but no I still don’t appreciate finding multiple cockroaches around our room. It makes me wonder if the rooms were thoroughly cleaned and this is especially important during COVID times. I believe that since our room is on the lower level and next to the ‘Ulu restaurant, the room was more susceptible to having cockroaches. We requested to move to a higher room floor away from the restaurant and we stayed there for 3 nights and did not find a single cockroach so it makes me believe the room we initially had was a magnet for cockroaches.    Another morning, at 7 am, we hear loud pounding from a room next to ours. It woke us up and we called the front desk to complain about the noise. They said construction wasn’t supposed to start until 9 am, but someone did not get the message. By the time they fully investigated and the noise stopped we were already wide awake.    Restaurants:  Let me start off by saying there are only 2 restaurants at the hotel as the grill was not open yet during our stay. There is also a 3rd option at the residents beach house. What they forget to tell their guests is that you should book reservations to these restaurants way in advance of your stay. We tried to book reservations for dinner every night when we got there and each night our reservation wasn’t until 8 or 8:30 pm. Part of the frustration of eating late was that menu items would be sold out by the time we ordered. The experience was also frustrating because the concierge made it seem like they were doing us a favor by getting us a reservation if at all, even though we were staying at the resort - where else are we supposed to eat?    Again, service was inconsistent. Sometimes you get a really great waiter and other times you don’t. Some of the waiters seemed to be new and not knowledgeable about the menu and the prices. When we ordered the seafood tower we were told it was $150, but it turned out to be $250. It was not about the money, but you would expect the server to know how much things cost especially since the menu is limited.    Pool/Beach:  The main pool is always packed and a lot of times you have to put your name on the waitlist if you don’t arrive early enough. Service at the main pool was good as servers tend to be available and attentive. Beachside service, however, is again, inconsistent. Sometimes we were met with really good service and other times you wouldn't see a server come around for hours. The beaches were not crowded so it was nice and relaxing, however there was construction going on so depending on where you decide to relax you can hear loud banging throughout the day.    Conclusion:  I think we should have waited until they worked out all of their kinks after their COVID shutdown before we dropped $25,000+ to stay here. We’ve been to 5 star properties all around the world and this is not it. One crucial thing that defines a 5 star hotel is consistently good and attentive service throughout your stay as well as going above and beyond to make their guests happy and satisfied. We didn’t feel like our complaints were well addressed and issues kept coming up throughout our stay. After multiple complaints about multiple issues during our stay, not once did a manager come to our room to apologize even after we spoke to a front desk manager about our issues nor was anything sent to our room as a gesture of good faith. Anything they would have given us would have been immaterial to the $25,000+ we spent there but even just the gesture of sending a bottle of wine or some fruits would have made us feel like they at least cared and acknowledged our negative experiences.    I hope they work out their issues and return to the Four Seasons Hualalai we’ve come to know and love.",Aug 2021,May 2021,,,
800557210,30,A nice and relaxing trip that could have been better with a few tweaks,"Let me start off saying my favorite four seasons to date is punta mita. I don’t know if it’s fair to compare this one to one in another country, but it’s inevitable. Also I know it’s Covid and the resorts are just coming back to life so they got a pass for that    Kids for all seasons didn’t greet us at the lobby like punta mita and the guy didn’t even tell us what was going on for today. Just gave us a paper print out.  Golf cart to room but he didn’t show us how everything worked or tell us where everything was. Didn’t show me where the laundry was or take us by kids for all seasons.  No chair reservations at pool.  You know it’s bad when you’re at one resort and you’re already regretting not having gone to the other one that is your gold standard. First day was kind of a let down. We had never stayed here before. I remember when I was younger, a lot of friends on Oahu had had their honeymoon here.    Rooms: newly remodeled and bathrooms have fans which are nice but toilet door is slotted so no privacy there although there are pocket doors to the bathroom itself. Ours wouldn’t close all the way. Kids did not get the usual welcome package. It wasn’t until they were playing with a little boy their age at the pool who said the water toy he had came in a bag with a stuffed animal and some other stuff that we realized. Service was spotty. Sometimes we wouldn’t get turn down service and sometimes they would try to come after we were sleeping.    Day 1:  Beach tree  Poke bowl $37- good but a lot of rice and the rice was really plain - I think it would have been better on a salad or with furikake rice. Kids burgers $12 had buns thantlooked smashed and flat like they just came out of a bag.    Pool service : sat for about 2 hours on the first day and no one in a blue shirt came to see it I wanted water or anything to drink. Really the reason we stay at the FS instead of the Waikoloa is for the service and so i can lounge in my lounge chair and someone can wait on me and bring me a ridiculously expensive drink, am I right? After about 15 min a guy in a white shirt came and asked if i wanted towel covers for the chair. Had to go up to the little shack and request a water at around the 1,5 hr mark even though three waiters walked passed me about 50 times. No sunblock advertised but they have it if you ask. Pool service improved on subsequent days. Popsicles at around 1:30 but where’s the sunglasses doctor?    Shaved ice : they should be embarrassed. Considering Hawaii and shaved ice are as synonymous as big island and Mauna Kea , this is the WORST shaved ice in Hawaii EVER. It’s a snow cone pretending to be a shaved ice. Ice is crunchy and tiny pieces of ice and should be shaved, fluffy and soft. Syrup is too sweet. It was like being at a resort in Montana that’s trying to make like it’s Hawaiian. And for two for almost $20? Ridiculous. Big island shaved ice company at Waikoloa shopping center has real shaved ice. But really, if you’re the four seasons and supposed to be so amazing no one wants to leave your property, you should invest in a better shaved ice machine.    Hualalai grill: octopus appetizer. For $23 it’s only ok. You get one tentacle and I’m sorry to say it was chewy. They need to send the chef to osteria mozza in LA or the four seasons punta mita to learn how to make octopus.    Residence beach house - highly recommend for a relaxed atmosphere and restaurant on the beach but harder to get reservations as priority is given to the residences. But they can tell you by 3:30. We went at 5:30 and it wasn’t busy at all. Food was great! My favorite restaurant of them all for the atmosphere and simple cuisine.    Trading post is a great deal ( comparatively) for breakfast and grab and go stuff.    Lagoon in the ocean was better than their lagoon - it had lots of turtles but be careful wading in as they have urchins. Also go earlier when tide is lower. Free snorkel rental    Overall service was good. Everyone willing to do things that were asked but I can’t say that anyone went the extra mile except for the vallet guy who threw four umbrullas into our trunk and saved us from getting soaked when we told him we were going to Hilo for the day.

794303683,50,"Outstanding as usual, but...","We have been going to Kona for more than 20 years and have always made an effort to stay at Hualalai, mainly at the 4S and once through a VRBO rental with another family. This trip was originally scheduled for June 2020 as my son's graduation trip which obviously did not happen. This trip we went to Kauai for 5 days and Kona for 6 days. Our vacations are relatively active as pretty avid scuba divers, hers, and golfers. So, we do not spend that much time at on property although always enjoy dining at the 4S and utilizing the Spa.    First off, the renovations at the 4S Hualalai are stunning. We always stay in the Golf-Ocean view rooms as there is parking directly in front of the rooms making early morning dive boat times much easier to load gear and get to Honokohau Harbor or to Kawaihae (if diving Kohala) on time. The decor was getting dated, but the room renovations are absolutely stunning. Hualalai only allows 3 people in a room and therefore we do need to reserve 2 rooms for our family of 4. That is a substantial expense not necessarily incurred at other Kohala resorts. It is supremely relaxing to have 2 bathrooms and the kid in another room, but it will be a personal decision on whether or not it's worth it for families.    The new pool at King's pond is also stunning. We did not spend too much time there other than the last day, but what an amazing infinity pool with 2 integrated hot water spas. The infinity edge overlooking the King's pond is stunning.    What always has us return to Hualalai other than the property itself are the people there. They are warm, friendly, not stuffy, and bend over backwards to try to accommodate requests. Despite changes due to COVID protocols, we still feel the warmth of the staff and their dedication to making the Hualalai experience as memorable as possible. The concierges were outstanding although a bit slower in replies by email than I remember. However, they were very attentive the closer we got to our stay. Be sure to book restaurant reservations including off property locations well in advance.    Dining at Ulu, Beach Tree, and Hualalai Grill were outstanding. I was a bit worried about staff shortages due to COVID, but I have to say the wait staff at Ulu, Beach Tree, and HG were genuinely some of the best I've had in all of Hawaii. The quality of food was also consistently great although, as with everything in Hawaii, very expensive. Ulu is still the most amazing location for breakfast and dinner just steps away from the ocean.    Mundane features such as full size self-service complimentary washer/dryers located just a few steps from all rooms really are important details that add to the experience.    The Hualalai golf course renovation and re-seeding of the course and practice range have significantly up'ed the quality. Hualalai had by far the best conditioning of all the golf courses I played in Hawaii...although the Mauna Kea golf course is by far the most beautiful.    One feature that we've always taken advantage of was shower facilities available in the evening before traveling to the airport. We try to fly red-eyes out of Kona to take advantage of a full day and a last sunset dinner. There is nothing as nice as being able to shower and freshen up before going to the airport. As of 2019, the locker rooms at the Golf Club were available (sometimes opened by security) as late as past 7 pm. This year the golf locker rooms are closed completely. The Hualalai Spa was available for this purpose but closed at 7 pm and is restricted to ages >14. Hopefully as Hawaii relaxes COVID restrictions, the 4S will make the locker rooms at the Gold Club available again for late showers and for families with children.    Overall, the experience was outstanding, as expected. The renovations were perfectly executed and despite the COVID restrictions, the 4S staff were amazing. Having been the 4S @ Hualalai 15 times (I think), it is nothing less than what I expected and remembered.    Which brings up the ""but..."" The cost of staying at Hualalai has dramatically increased especially over the past 10 years. For years I felt the cost as a ""bargain"" for the experience, facilities, etc. The golf-ocean rooms (which we specifically love for the parking convenience) are now booking for $2000 a night. For a family of 4 needing 2 rooms (based on their occupancy restrictions), that is becoming prohibitive. I have no issues with Hualalai charging as much as they can based on market demand. And, I'm sure that their reputation will continue to keep their occupancy high. But, I'm sure for some frequent return visitors that felt part of the Hualalai Ohana for years will need to recalibrate their vacation spending calculus. I know this family will have to.    But, bottom line, if you. wish to stay at the finest resort on the west side of the Big Island of Hawaii with stunning, updated rooms, fine dining, great service, amazing amenities, all with a warm smile, you won't miss at the 4S @ Hualalai...",Jun 2021,June 2021,,,"Clarendon Hills, Illinois"

793823144,50,"Paradise found, again !","This was our third visit in the last 4 years. By far, the grounds and the service bring us back year after year. The updated rooms were really nicely appointed and thoroughly enjoyed the more comfortable accommodations. Concierge staff are attentive, accommodating, and we were very happy with all the activities they suggested and planned( private volcano tour and Kayaking to Captain Cook’s Monument , fun!).    No, despite what you read in other reviews, we had no issues with any of the homeowners. The owners we met greeted with the spirit of Aloha and shared how much they enjoy their community.    The cake from the bakeshop for my husband’s 65th was incredible . If you have a special occasion, or, if you don’t, order a cake! Room service graciously brought slices of the cake to our room and the pool upon our request! The cake was truly delectable !    We loved the quiet pool, which wasn’t so quiet this year. The “quiet” wasn’t enforced, which would have been nice. The reservation of cabanas was a sketchy situation. A different reservation approach would be welcomed.    Dinners were all on point, but the food and the service at the Resident’s Beach House were a touch above the others. No issues with reservations if you plan prior to arrival with the concierge team. The Beachtree chef even prepared the ahi my family caught while deep sea fishing! The resort could use another diverse restaurant or two or perhaps a “food cart/truck”? Planned dinners aside from Luaus in the gorgeous outdoor theatre, which seems underutilized? A casual meal option at dinner would be appreciated. We ordered room service from Beachtree restaurant for dinner, which was lovely on our Lanai. We had breakfast from the general store daily, which we always look forward to.    The construction was a bit off putting considering the price . It was odd because these construction events are usually so subtle. Maybe one too many projects at the same time(beach walks weren’t as magical as before), but we understand that they are renovating due to market demand .    A few glitches were very quickly rectified by genuinely kind upper management. Mahalo to all.    Truly, a very special place,  A Hui Ho",Jun 2021,June 2021,Traveled with family,,"Midland, Texas"

The service was very hit or miss. More miss than hit. Half the workers were super friendly and accommodating and the other half seemed like they were annoyed or didn’t want to help us. For example requests such as moving pool chairs closer or getting towels seemed like the most bothersome request that we ended up doing it ourselves. Or having to wait 2 hours for our room when we checked in at 6:30pm, shouldn't there have been rooms that were already available? I’d recommend everyone to at least stay there once but too mediocre of a service to be a yearly destination.

791315494,30,"Incredible Place, But Noise and “Owners”Killed It For Us","Beautiful seaside location and room appointments. Top notch facility. Rendered useless by constant daytime noise and very limited restaurant availability.    Construction noise by the pools (and rooms surrounding the pools) is unmanageable. No quiet at the quiet pool or the adult pool. What’s the point if you can’t relax? Use headphones for your entire stay? It’s inexcusable at the price point. Picture large carts transporting lumber down the paths all day long, followed by the sound of them then being installed in two large nearby buildings.    There’s also a constant chatter among guests amid this competition for restaurant or beach resources. There’s some type of stratification at play that caught us way off guard. It’s strange to be asked (by other guests): are you staying here? Do you own? Are you renting ? We very much got the impression that the people who “own” feel they are more entitled to the resources more so than the hotel guests? On several occasions, they plainly stated it to your face. On man even told us what his initiation fee and yearly dues are. I am asking myself - “why is this even a thing and why am I being asked to defend myself at a property that charges >$1k/night?”. Weird position to impose on your hotel guests.    The children of the residents (adult children or younger) seem to roam with impunity across the resort. Zero enforcement of bad behavior, drunkenness or impact on hotel guests. It’s like you’re vacationing as a guest in someone else’s country club. Bizarre scenario.    Love the place. Love the room. Love the views and the pools. Construction and the resident experience kill it.

791001874,10,"Miserable experience, will stay away from going to any more Four Season Property","rubens881    This was our 3rd Four Seasons property visit. The first time (2017), we visited Four seasons Oahu, we (I and my wife) were super impressed. So we returned to Four Seasons Oahu in 2019.    And we had a bad experience  https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rubens881?fid=db5b0986-d8bc-4b7b-960b-5d3acc110baa    This year, we thought let's give another try to Four Season property, so we (I, my wife and our 3 years old son) visited Four Seasons Kona from May 15th to 26th.    Let's see, where we start:  - The room was a partial golf course view and ocean view on one side. During our full stay, every day from morning to evening lots of massive noises from big construction equipments. Our golf course and Ocean view was sprinkled with lots of big construction vehicles. Other side of the room was parking lot.  Several parts of the property, lots of construction noises, equipments moving around all of the time.    - Upon arrival, I reported that our bathroom pocket door doesn't close property, very hard to drag and close. Supposedly they sent a mechanic to fix it, and nothing changed. So for the entire stay we had to deal with a very hard to close bathroom door. By the way bathroom door has no lock, and when you have 3 years old kid, you can imagine the plight of my wife, who simply couldn't use the bathroom peacefully.    - First night, our 3 years old slept in the baby crib provided by the hotel. Morning when we woke up, his entire body has 50+ large bite marks of something. Upon reporting to the front desk, they said maybe mosquitos (even though our balcony door, front door were closed). We were given a mosquito repellent candle.    Second night, exactly the same thing happened. Another 30+ big new bite marks. This time again I reported to the front desk, and I have questioned that they might have bed bugs or something along that time.  Only after that, housekeeping came and cleaned the entire room, changed all the mattresses of the bed and crib. Only after that for the reminder of the say our son was not bitten by bed bugs or someother bugs that were in the mattresses.    - On the third day, our son suddenly screamed in the bathroom. We discovered a cockroach in the bathroom. Reported to the front desk but no reaction. We took a photo of it. You can see it by yourself.    - Entire property really has 3 restaurants. ""Residents Beach House"", ""Ulu"" and ""Beach Tree"". This property is far away from any other business. So as a guest, you can expect that you can walk-in at least in one of the restaurant and grab dinner.    First evening, we walked-in to restaurant at 5.30 pm, and we were told that they are fully booked, we have to do take out or order in-room service. Even though we saw several tables were empty.    ""Residents beach house"" you can never get a reservation. No prior reservation is allowed. On the day of dining, only at 3 PM, reservation queue gets opened. We can't call and reserve, only concierge has to do that. For the entire during concierge didn't get a single day reservation for us.    After 3 - 4 calls to concierge, on the second day we got reservations to alternate restaurant, however for two days there were no dinner reservation.  It is very odd to see that a high end five star hotel doesn't have enough seats for its own guests.    - Food in Beach tree and Ulu restaurants, that is another story. First we should give credit where it is due. Pastry chef is Ulu restaurant, is excellent. We even enquired about the chef. We live in the city in US with very expansive restaurant choices. So we have had our fair share of understanding what is means ""tasty food"", and on top of that my wife is very much into gourmet cooking.    Food in general in Ulu and Beach tree is very mediocre to bad. We were very surprised that, food quality so mediocre in a reputated five star hotel.  During our 11 days stay, given that we had to alternate between two restaurants for lunch and dinner, by 7th day, we were repeating the same mediocre food over and over again.    For breakfast you have to go to Ulu restaurant. First few days we took breakfast buffet. In the fruit section, they have cut papaya, however they are not peeled. Try eating unpeeled papaya with fork, spoon and knife, that is an exercise. On the second day I asked at the fruit counter, why they don't peel papaya, and I was told that if I wanted to eat peeled papaya, we have to order from a la carte menu. That is an interesting answer, and very surprising.  Breakfast buffet option for the entire duration pretty much remained unchanged, may be 2 - 3 options changed.    Two times in the restaurant, we were given stale chips with stale smell (when we ordered chips and salsa), and server acknowledged it later.    When we checked in, we were told that hotel policy that, kids younger than 4 eats for free. Everytime we would go to the restaurant, they would charge for our 4 years old son and then we have check the bill, and ask the server to change the bill.    During our entire duration, we hired a nanny (via hotel referenced nanny service). After we settled our bill and came home, and we checked that, everytime our nanny went to the restaurant with our son, hotel charged for his meal, and our nanny simply charged to the room.  This is a sneaky tactics by hotel, try to nickel and dime you in every possible ways. In most of the well known high end hotel, simply don't charge for kids below certain age. We as a hotel guests, we don't have to be vigilant that hotel is not charging us money incorrectly.    - In the kids pool area, there are absolutely no toys, nothing.  - In the adult pool area, when we will go there, sometime we will wait for 5 - 10 mins, before someone would come with towels etc to setup the beach chairs, when we see that folks responsible for the pools were chatting and hanging out amongst themselves    On final note, when we arrived in the Kona Four seasons, we were chatting with the staff members. They asked us that if we visited any four seasons in the past, in response we told them that we were in Four seasons Ohau. At that time we were informed that, hotel manager of Oahu Four Seasons is managing the Kona Four seasons. Hearing that I and my wife sighed, given our bad experience at Oahu Four seasons (during our second visit), but we were still optimistic.    Well, ""Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me"", so it was our foolishness that we decided to make a follow up trip to Four seasons.    PS: My wife and I took few massage sessions. The masseuse we had were excellent.    After we returned home, I called up Four Seasons to report the problems. I was first told that, send an email to their office of president. Upon insistence, the person on the other end took down the notes. I spent 45 mins explaining all the issue. So much for customer service.",Jun 2021,May 2021,,,

790019128,50,Gorgeous luxury resort with superb service,"We first visited Four Seasons Hualalai in 2018, and enjoyed it so much we picked it as our first post-vaccination trip destination. I was not disappointed, the property is as lovely as ever and the service is still outstanding. It’s not always perfect, but whenever there was a lapse, the response more than made up for it.    Particular kudos to the executive chef, Richard, and the rest of the kitchen management and staff, for going above & beyond to accommodate my dietary restrictions. He communicated with me prior to arrival, offering his phone number if I ever wanted to contact him for assistance. They even made a delicious cake for me, and were happy to share recipes. It really put my mind at ease and made me feel welcome.    They are making every effort to provide a safe, clean experience for everyone, with masks required in all public areas except when seated at your table or the beach/pool. I did note that enforcement seemed to lessen a bit after the CDC’s most recent announcement, but you are outdoors for almost everything, including meals, and tables and loungers are well-spaced out, so it feels very safe and relaxing. They take your temperature and make a rather perfunctory effort to review screening questions before putting on your daily wristband when you go to breakfast.    The King’s Pond area has been significantly modified; it’s still lovely to look at but a bit less “natural” than before, with a new infinity pool, deck area with loungers, and some additional structures. We really enjoyed that pool, so I think it’s a good improvement. At the other end of the resort, a couple of new oceanfront buildings are under construction near the adult pool and Residents’ Beach Club, which unfortunately meant listening to the sound of construction while at the adult pool. For that reason, I would currently recommend avoiding rooms in that location.    The rooms have been updated since our first stay, and I was especially pleased that one of the few improvements I wished for last time has been implemented – handhelds were added to the rain showers. (My other wish, that they get a true shave ice machine for the surf shack, remains unfulfilled; it’s still just an overpriced snow cone.) The rooms are gorgeous, well-appointed and comfortable. Plenty of drawer and closet space, multiple bedside outlets for charging electronics, reading lights, a refrigerator, and an iPad for browsing menus, ordering food or other services, etc.    I particularly love that the rooms here are scattered in low-rise buildings with individual entrances, it does not feel like a huge, crowded resort. No hallways, no elevators, just a relaxed island vibe. We were offered an upgrade to a suite for the latter part of our stay, at a reduced rate, which we took advantage of. We didn’t use the living room much, but having the larger lanai with two loungers was really delightful.",May 2021,May 2021,,,"Seattle, Washington"

Even though there were COVID precautions happening (most notably with the buffet which was difficult to navigate and hard to hear the servers behind the glass), the precautions were hardly even noticeable. Also, the hotel was either at or very close to capacity when we stayed but with the addition of the new pool it was much easier than in past years to get a chair! Only the adult pool chairs were a little tricky to get, but every other pool had really good turnover.    Shout out to Michael our bellman who was a delight during the tour and bag drop off, Shannon at the swim up bar who invented multiple custom cocktails for me, Arturo at the kings pond who gave us above and beyond service and Floyd at Ulu who made our dinner amazing with his knowledge of wines and sorted us out when our table was way too windy!",May 2021,May 2021,Traveled with friends,,"Holualoa, Hawaii"

787585569,50,Return to Four Seasons Hualalai!!,"My husband and I have stayed at many 5 star hotels around the world, but Four Seasons Hualalai will always be one of our favorite resorts. We stayed here a few years ago and they make you feel special as soon as you step foot into the resort. They welcome you with the warmest aloha greeting, a refreshing drink, and whisk you to your room in golf carts. Not all 5 star hotels are the same when it comes to service, or even among Four Seasons, but service at FS Hualalai is top notch. Every staff member you come across at the resort greets you with the warmest smile and makes you feel right at home.    The property itself is stunning with amazing views of the ocean. One of my favorite things to do was to eat breakfast at the restaurant and enjoy the amazing view every morning. They have multiple pools at the resort including a swimmable pool filled with various tropical fishes. We loved lounging next to the pool and enjoying the relaxing atmosphere. My husband was surprised that on our first night, he walked by the pool and asked for a quick towel from a pool attendant in a 20 second interaction and the next day, they greeted him, “Mr. Liu,” as if they had been serving him all day before - most places don’t even remember your name. The rooms itself were very spacious and clean and some have outdoor showers.    Out of all the places we could choose from, we chose Four Seasons Hualalai as our first vacation spot after getting vaccinated. We are so excited to be back on Monday and will be staying for a week.

787343845,50,Heaven for a first trip to Hawaii,"We selected FS Hualalai to get back to travelling, and it did not disappoint. From the moment we drove up and were quickly checked in by a friendly person in a gorgeous setting, we had an idyllic time. Yes, it's expensive. Yes , it's worth it. The room was comfortable and beautifully appointed. It was clean and comfortable and suitable for its surroundings. The landscaping and pools are glorious, and even though there was construction going on, it was pretty much invisible and they must have been using elf tools it was so quiet. Every staff member was warm and authentically welcoming and concerned about us. Little touches like water and towels as we went off property, or suggestions for little things like more tea bags made us feel truly welcome. The setting was amazing- I saw spinner dolphins off the beach and walked the shore line every day, and felt like I was in paradise. The only drawbacks were the food- while breakfast and the pool food and in room dining were very good, I was slightly disappointed in the two main restaurants. The menus and food were just OK but still very expensive. For the price point , I expected WOW. I got WOW on every other front.

787282126,30,Not up to par,"Since the beginning of the Covid virus I have been daydreaming about returning to the Four Seasons Hualalai on the big Island of Hawaii. I have spent quite a few happy times there with my family and loved the property and the service and also the delicious food. When I was finally able to travel I immediately booked my room there and looked forward to a wonderful visit. Sadly, I was very disappointed in the service that I received and hope that things will turn around when everyone recovers from the pandemic.  First of all, the Hawaiian tourist board makes it very difficult to go to Hawaii as they require a negative Covid test 72 hours or less prior to your flight and they also require it from certain testing places they have approved. It is necessary to upload the results to the website of the state of Hawaii as well as another site which collects personal data from travelers(Perseus) . Most people I know that have gone through this found it frustrating and very stressful because you aren’t sure that you have everything you need not to have to be quarantined once you arrive in Hawaii. Most everyone on our plane was given another Covid test at the airport. I found this really wrong.Why make people go through so many hoops prior to getting to Hawaii and then once they arrive test them again? Particularly if they’ve been vaccinated!  I was looking forward to arriving at the resort but unfortunately when I did arrive I was not greeted appropriately and I was left to sit in the lobby of the hotel for nearly 20 minutes. Though I had told the hotel when I was arriving they apparently were confused and thought I was just there for lunch. I finally had to go to the front desk and complain about the wait and I was told to go back and sit down and that someone would be with me shortly. When someone finally came and took us to our rooms it was not done with the same grace that one usually finds being welcomed to a hotel in Hawaii.  My hotel suite was beautiful but there was no welcoming gift as there usually is when one pays for an expensive suite and is a return guest. Again, I did not feel that my presence was appreciated or the money that I was spending to stay here.  The first night we had dinner at the Ulu Grill which is very overrated, hugely expensive and not worth one’s time.Unfortunately, there is only one other alternative which is the beach side grill: more pleasant than Ulu but not great. The food at both places could definitely use some help and the menu is limited and not particularly interesting. Normally there’s a third restaurant open in the golf club but this was closed and our attempts to have dinner at the Residents Beach club were a failure.  We ordered dinner twice from room service and both times it came an hour early and had to be returned to the kitchen. The head of the catering department called both times to apologize but it was actually funny that the same mistake kept being made.  I had some very odd and unpleasant experiences with the front desk staff at the spa as well as the locker room staff. The practitioners that have been there for years are wonderful but someone should step in and instruct the front desk staff on proper communication with guests  I would say that the housekeeping department could also use some instruction as on several occasions I found things that hadn’t been done properly. The standards are definitely slipping and it’s very upsetting to see.  I really hope when Covid is over the Four Seasons management will make some changes here and pay attention to the way things used to be at this hotel. I used to tell people that I thought it was the best run hotel in the world with the best food and the most beautiful surroundings. It was so disappointing to have this experience and I really feel let down. I completely understand that everyone is stressed by the Covid experience but I also think that management at this hotel is not overseeing it as it was overseen in the past.I hope things change.",Apr 2021,April 2021,Traveled as a couple,,"Greenwich, Connecticut"

786029757,50,"The Time of Your Life, and Well Worth It.","Last year I offered a stellar assessment of the Four Seasons Maui as essentially without peer in the South Pacific. I spoke too soon. In my defense, it had been nearly 20 years since I last visited Four Seasons Hualalai on the Big Island of Hawaii, so my memory might have faded. I’ve just returned from a one-week refresher course.    Hualalai is nothing less than stunning. More eco-friendly resort than swank high rise, it is easily distinguished from its cousin on Maui. Maui has shopping within walking distance of the property, a spate of good restaurants nearby if you want to venture off site, and an upbeat suburban vibe throughout the island. A driver told me he preferred the Big Island because it is “more authentic.” This resort and this island are quiet and understated.    Four Seasons sits on the Kona coast, the northwest sector of the Big Island, a 15-minute ride from Kona Airport. Including its Jack Nicklaus-designed golf course, the resort boasts over 800 acres of prime real estate, beautifully manicured and maintained daily to promote a recurring sense of fresh wonder. The cart paths and walkways never feel tired or worn. The flowers bloom. The birds preen. The humans are generally soft spoken. There is a Zen-like quality to the experience.    Most of the guest rooms are in two-story pods surroundings four pool areas (including some that feature two pools). The lower rooms have walk out lanais leading directly to putting-green soft grasses and then pool decks. They also feature outdoor rain showers in private stone enclosures. Upstairs rooms have better views to the water or golf course, but no outdoor shower option. Bathrooms are well stocked with upscale amenities and a good-sized dispenser of an aloe-based gel for sunburned skin. Every room is newly renovated, tastefully decorated, and spectacular.    Most guests focus on the water. Everyone has some kind of ocean view, and the Pacific is never far away in sight or sound. Adults avoiding children have their own pool area with swim-up bar, hammocks on the green, and a short stroll to the beach. The serenity pool welcomes all ages, but there is no jumping, pool toys, or cell phone chatter to pierce the relative quiet. Further north, there is an all-purpose pool and a baby pool, and further still is the saltwater King’s Pond for swimming and snorkeling with hundreds (thousands?) of native fish and rays. Above the pond is still another infinity pool for unlimited use.    At either end of the resort are restaurants, Ulu to the north, featuring primarily Asian fusion cuisine and a killer breakfast buffet. To the south is the Residents’ Beach House, a members-first ocean front dining experience with a more American menu. The Beach Tree restaurant and bar serves casual bar food, pizzas and burgers in the middle of this coastline. The Hualalai Grille above the golf pro shop has a diverse menu with second story views of the golf course and the rest of the property. All the venues feature stunning, unspoiled views of the Pacific.    Four Seasons lacks nothing in the fitness regime. A full-service spa includes outdoor treadmills and bikes, a four-lane lap pool, weight room, and a regulation half-basketball court. The tennis center features eight wind-protected courts, teaching pros, demo racquets, and ball machine rentals. (Tennis players will tell you that sometimes you just want to work on a stroke by yourself without engaging a tennis pro. Most resorts won’t let you use a ball machine.)    The Hualalai golf course spreads over the south side of the resort, and several of the holes play alongside the ocean, between something far more challenging than deep rough: ancient lava fields border the oceanfront holes and I suspect some of the interior ones as well. The course offers an expansive driving range and a fully equipped “hale,” or outbuilding, where golfers can refine their swing in a digital tee box with video feedback.    Water sports include paddle boarding, snorkeling, and James Bond-like handheld, propeller driven scooters to push or pull snorkelers around with far less effort. Whale watching Zodiacs are available in whale migration season.    Things everyone should know: complimentary washers and dryers, detergent and dryer sheets are sprinkled around the resort, so no need to overpack. Free wifi throughout the property, faster upgrade for a fee. Room service will bring you food not only from their kitchen, but also from every restaurant on site if you’re willing to wait a few extra minutes. You don’t need a car, and bellmen will take you longer distances on golf carts should you need them. The concierge desk runs cars out from Enterprise at the airport, so you can rent a car when you want one for the day. There is a gas station on site (open until 7pm), adjacent to a general store offering coffee, ice cream, sandwiches, and treats if you’re on the go.    I have only touched the surface of the broad array of amenities available from an incredibly resourceful concierge staff, singling out Summer, Kay-Ree, and Chenin for extraordinary effort on my behalf. They represent examples of an impeccably trained team, always willing to lend a hand regardless of job title. I saw Wil working the front desk, and later driving a guest in a golf cart. Special thanks to Melissa at the front desk for her ingenuity, and Sean herding cats at the Ulu buffet daily.    These folks are representative of an ethos that seems to be slowly vanishing from the hospitality industry. Courtesy, flexibility, and resilience run in short supply these days, and a global pandemic surely doesn’t improve one’s patience. I credit Sebastian Hinsch and Charlie Parker, General Manager, both of whom were visible, engaged and helpful throughout. Four Seasons is lucky to have these able men and women, and we are all beneficiaries of their skill and good nature.    If you are looking for a Las Vegas-style vacation, this Four Seasons will disappoint.

786023492,50,Best Family Vacation Ever!,The Four Seasons Hualalai really delivered up one of the best family vacations Ive ever been on! Two adorable children's robes and complimentary kids packs (with a pool toy/stuffed animal/coloring book and shaved ice coupons) had my boys cheering from the start. The resort is breathtaking and Im not sure I could get closer to the ocean if I tried! Our boys left it all on the beach/pools each day and my husband and I could relax with a cocktail and be delighted watching them love life. (If you are sans kids- there was an adults only pool as well.) I made reservations ahead of time for the restaurants each night and never had an issue. We did the trading post or room service on our deck each morning. Ulu Sushi delivered up one of the best meals Ive ever had on our last night. Every single staff member I encountered was so nice and accommodating to us. They really go out of their way to make sure we had the time of our lives.

785943877,50,"Thoughtful, genuine service at a stunning property","Of many hospitality experiences, Hualalai was by far the best in terms of service and amenities. We were coming from our wedding about an hour away on Hawaii island and the Hualalai team ensured our dinner reservation could be adjusted, and when we arrived that evening, a host of bellmen were there to help me and my wife (including with her dress) and instantly put us at ease. The rooms are well apportioned and befitting the property, but it is the people who make the place. Service here was not only excellent - but what put it a cut above was how genuine all of the staff are. They genuinely care and want to help you, or just talk to you. Because they care, and ask questions and go above and beyond to suggest things that you might like or want to experience, you end up having a better trip and stay. On top of that, the thoughtful gestures and gifts (like the dinner staff knowing that it was our wedding night/honeymoon, to the thoughtful card and prosecco on ice in our room upon arrival), the staff and place embody the spirit of aloha.

783916474,50,A lasting impression by a valuable employee,"I hope this commendation for one of your employees - Keone in recreation - gets to him and his direct supervisor because his kindness has left a lasting impression on me that I won't forget.    My partner and I stayed at the FSH over the weekend of February 27-March 1, as a staycation from 'normal life' in Honolulu. It was a great stay all around and felt especially lucky to get a 4pm late check-out on Monday before our 5pm flight back home. We decided to spend the afternoon at King's Pond in front of our room and were graciously welcomed by Keone. Not only was he friendly and welcoming, Keone checked on us regularly throughout the afternoon - always quick to notice an empty glass or a need for new towels. Relaxing away, we lost track of time and ordered lunch around 3:30. It was only after a few minutes that we realized it was almost check-out time. We had gotten most of our things ready but we hurried to grab our bags from the room and returned to our spot at the pool. By then lunch had arrived in the bento boxes and without any time to eat, we asked Keone for our bill and told him not to worry about the food. Keone refused to accept that; instead, he jumped into action. He sent the food back to the kitchen to be packaged to-go and then asked if we wanted a golf cart to the lobby. I told him it was fine and not to worry about it but out of his genuine concern, he told us to go ahead to the lobby for check-out and he would bring our food to the bell desk. True to his word, Keone arrived just a few minutes later with our food in hand; after he graciously handed it off to us and a quick fist bump, he thanked us!    I want to emphasize that this commendation has nothing to do with the food - which was delicious, by the way. Through his kindness, Keone not only embodied the service standard synonymous with the Four Season, but he truly represented the warmth and hospitality of the people of Hawai`i Island. Often times, acts of kindness are rewarded only with a ""thank you"" and then perhaps the interaction is forgotten over time. I wanted to make sure you as his family at the FSH know the kind of person Keone is, and I also wanted him to know that we are truly humbled and grateful to him for showing us care and concern that perhaps few others might have shown. Through our interactions with Keone over that afternoon and the lasting impression he made on us, I hope you know you have a truly valuable member on your team and I hope he can be recognized for going above and beyond for two babooz from Honolulu.",Mar 2021,February 2021,,"Choose a ground level room for a unique, outdoor lava rock shower.",
783503550,30,Not what I expected for a Four Seasons Property,"I was thrilled to be able to take a vacation given the COVID mess. I realize the property has only recently been reopened. The service was not nearly as good at the many other four seasons properties I have stayed at in the past.    The room was an ocean view that with tax and other fees was $2K/night. Way overpriced given the level of service.    1. Room cleaning was bad. Sand on the floor, carpet not vacuumed daily. Coffee and creamer not restocked.    2. Getting into the restaurants at dinner was not easy with long waits.    3. The concierge screwed up the billing for the day trips (Entire excursions were billed to one party in our group).    4. Room service food was delicious. I was happy about this because I had to eat room service several nights because the restaurants were full.    5. Poolside service was hit and miss. I expect more from four seasons.    6. The beach was very rocky and when the high tide came in at night, the walkway on the property would be covered with sand. Only cleaned up intermittently.    7. Resort is being rebuilt. Lots of construction noise.    8. Spa was nice with great massages    9. Gym was open    I'm giving them a break for what should be a 1-star review - due to the COVID closure. I can say with confidence that I will NEVER stay at this property again. My expectations for a four seasons property with a room this expensive were not even close to being met. The four seasons should change the name until they get it together.",Feb 2021,February 2021,,,"Newport Beach, California"
783432674,10,To each their own but this one is certainly not for us,"The hotel is clearly popular as it is crowded but I guess we have a completely different vision of luxury. We stayed just 2 nights in a 2 bedroom 'ocean' view suite and will clearly never return. For that price its about as bad as it guest from a value for money perspective.    Yes its clearly not a high rise building but it is however a crowded building and the ocean view is mostly a view on the pool with a little piece of ocean behind this. Forget about privacy and seclusion.    This is not a slow life quiet destination. Instead it is crowded everywhere. Restaurants are so loud that with our family of 6 we could not hear ourselves talk. If you love restaurants where its hard to get a booking (which it is), where there are people everywhere in classy attires than you ll love this. If your idea of a holidays is spending time away from a buzzing New York restaurant then you won't love this.    Like any crowded place you certainly have the sentiment that something must be great here for everyone to come. The fact that the paying cabanas are located at the edge of the pool in front of the most crowded path with no privacy whatsoever (and yes there a much more discreet options facing the ocean) gave us a hint. These were always occupied or reserved. I guess if you love showing how much money you have and showing your new attires (perhaps with the price tag still on it) you ll love this place. If you like relaxing away from the crowd you' ll hate it.    Service is like in any place that doesn't need your business. Its like a popular private school with a long waiting list. You are not happy? well there is a long waiting list and we don't need your business so move on. We had lots of trouble in booking a restaurant for the nights we were staying in and had to eat much lated than we wanted - not to mention long waiting times.    Each of our request was met with a 'sorry this is not possible'. The first morning in the crowded breakfast area we waited 50 mins for our food. The next morning I went in 20 mins earlier to give the orders ahead of time and limit the wait but that was totally impossible. The hotel claims to love feedback but it never seemed like they were really interested or followed up in any way.    Covid wise the big island feels safe but I was not particularly impressed by the procedures. The tunraround time for instance in cleaning a room is 3 hours. In that time the room windows are kept close. There were alternative rooms (hotel wasn't full) but we were still given a room previously occupied a few hours earlier.    Last but not least the kids club is an infamy. We have visited quite a few kids club duding Covid (notably the exceptional ones at Waldorf Maldives and Soneva sushi) and have seen 4-5 every year in the last 15 years. This one is by very very fare the single worst one ever. I cant even think of a close second. We looked to bring our youngest son in the first afternoon. There were 4 children sitting on a table each watching a movie (this is what the kids club calls free time). The next morning we brought him in and whilst they pretend he would be doing arts and crafts they actually put him in front of a video game.    As I was driving to rent buggy boards 20 mins away (apparently the FS doesn't like the idea of not having you pay for any activity and hard to pay for BB rental so they don't have any) I got a call about 25 mins later claiming my son wanted to go back in the room. As I was in the car I said Id be there 20 mins later to the exasperation of the kids club team.    My son hated his 45 mins there. The staff is probably either hired from former DMV disgruntled employees with no interest whatsoever for children or perhaps from former prison guards. No direspect for these professions but clearly not trained at looking after children.    What was frustrating was that the only people that looked friendly were the dedicated team situated near the pools doing paid arts and craft. If you pay 40$. That was another element we did not like. As a client you are just as good as your wallet. Every activity you have to pay for.    On the positives, food was good and the they are great at looking after allergies.    Clearly the four seasons doesn't need our business (and clearly they don't care) but equally the hotel industry has changed. We have fond memories of great FS stays (Landaa Giravaru being the best) but time has passed and there are so many better alternatives for similar price points (Aman, Rosewood and smaller private hotels like Soneva) and we don't need them either. We are done with FS. So long.",Feb 2021,February 2021,,,Geneva
783391289,50,Lovely Resort,"Stayed in a residence within the resort and paid the upcharge to have daily access to Four Seasons. We had a very pleasant stay and were able to enjoy all the restaurants, spa and beach. Unfortunately, we could not sit next to our favorite pool in the Palm Grove area. Home renters are not allowed to sit next to any of the pools, only on the beaches on the covered lounges. Service beachside was not quite as good as we’ve had in the past poolside but perhaps some of the decrease in service had to do with Covid. No spritzing, sunglass or iPad cleaning, some days no snacks and slower service in general.    Dinners were lovely at Ulu and Beach Tree and it was great to have nightly entertainment. The spa was nice for services but of course the hot tub, outdoor showers, steam room, sauna were off-limits. My massage was wonderful but my husband’s was not satisfactory for him. He didn’t bother to voice a complaint when he knew all the therapists had not been working much in the past year. The weight room in the gym was disappointing because even though there was a 4 person max, it was not monitored and too many people would crowd in. It did not feel safe on some days so I left. We felt mostly safe from covid but noticed some guests flouted the rules and were never confronted by staff.    When at this resort we spend most of our time at the pools so due to the pool seating constraints we will probably stay at the hotel in the future.",Feb 2021,January 2021,,,California

781089447,50,Now is the time to go! The best in all of Hawaii,"It is always a pleasure to return to the Four Seasons Hualalai, but it was a special pleasure to come with my family for a much needed safe getaway during the pandemic. Upon arrival we were greeted by the omnipresent Resort Manager, Sebastian Hinsch. He could not do enough to make our family welcome and comfortable during our stay. I was so impressed to see him at 6:30 am one morning working hands on with and guiding the landscapers to make the pool area perfect after an overnight storm. Sebastian is true leader of his team and highly respected by them for his hard work.    I was blown away by the friendliness and attentiveness of all the Four Seasons Hualalai family, from the moment we arrived they went above and beyond. Tony Cook at the Front desk was a wizard at addressing our various questions and requests through the app and was so good about following up and making sure everything was perfect. The check-in process was quick and private, the staff were cautious about taking guest’s temperature and requiring wristbands once guests have had their temperature cleared — this made us feel safe and comfortable. Everyone visiting the island received a negative genetic Covid test, and another PCR test immediately upon arrival.    Occupancy is being controlled during the pandemic but even when the property is at 100% capacity it always feels very private and calm.    Once checked in we were escorted to our gorgeous entirely renovated guest room. We love both the lava shower gardens with orchids on the first floor rooms and the second floor views. The rooms at the resort are low rise bungalows with views of the beautiful, clear ocean that surrounds the island.  The beaches in this part of Hawaii are my favorite of all the islands — particularly beautiful with long stretches of white sand and framed by lava rock. Turtles come every day to sun on the beaches and feed amongst the coral just off shore. The snorkeling is just fantastic at any point you walk out into the ocean.    On the property, there are five incredible and very distinct pools, perfect for relaxing throughout the day. There is a family pool where the pool attendants go above and beyond, going around with frozen treat for the kids and adults. There is also an adult infinity pool and hot tub for very quiet relaxation. The Kings pond crescent has been entirely renovated and enhanced. There is now a large warm infinity pool which overlooks the Kings pond (stocked with thousands of tropical fish and an eagle ray to snorkel with and feed during feeding times). They also added three hot tubs to this area, with plentiful high quality loungers and shade. If you would like to exercise, there is also a dedicated lap pool next to the gym and spa. Its also worth mentioning that there is a ""pool"" in the ocean, carved out of the lava rock, the size of an olympic pool, but protected from the largest ocean waves by a natural lava wall. It also has many tropical fish and one day I saw three turtles grazing along the wall, and another day an almost three foot long rainbow colored parrot fish.    Do not miss taking a guided outrigger one morning of your stay (arranged through the incredible concierge). Ask for Chad! If you go anytime between 7:30-8:30 you will very likely see and possibly be able to swim/snorkel with one of the many pods of dolphins which grace the shores of the resort. We also saw a hump back whale family teaching a baby how to jump and flap their tale. It was magical and the memory of a lifetime.    The food at all of the restaurants was very good, but our favorite remains the Beachtree for dinner and Ulu for Breakfast. The food is almost all made by hand at the resort and sourced locally. The team who runs the restaurants, particularly the hostesses Tierra, Kora, and Precious at the front desk are a joy to see every day and do such a good job taking care of everyone.    The resort not only renovated all of their guest rooms, and made a tremendous addition to their pools, but they also have a new incredible General Manager, Charlie Parker, who is always on the move improving the experience for guests and team. He is very hands on and fully engaged with both guests and his new team. He was an absolute joy to see every day.    The Four Seasons Hualalai has been ranked as the number one resort in all of Hawaii for many years, and with the unveiling of this new renovation of rooms and the Kings Pond crescent, and the leadership of Sebastian and Charlie, its crown of true aloha has never shone so brightly.

The room, patio, bathroom- everything was huge and just lovely.  The new infinity pool above Kings Pond is incredible. Multiple hot tubs and the pool itself is warm and offers amazing views of the ocean (and pond!)  The adult pool was just opening back up so we spent some time there (they have my favorite Mai Tai and crushed ice) but there is still construction going on over there so it isn't quite as peaceful as the other pools.  We enjoyed breakfast and dinners at Ulu along with Beach tree and the Residents Beach House. Everything was excellent.  Also, the check-in process was seamless and very private.

778733740,50,Lived up to the hype!!,"Visited this property for a three night stay just two nights after they opened back up. Was immediately blown away by the friendliness and attentiveness of staff. We booked through the Amex Fine Hotels and Rewards program and received a room upgrade on arrival as they had availability.    The room was incredible - outdoor shower (only on lower level rooms!), fantastic bath products, extremely comfortable bed, modern interior design, great lanai with ocean view.    We were slightly disappointed to find out that two of the pools were closed due to ongoing renovations (they said they would be open by 12/9), including the Kings Pond which is stocked with tropical fish that you can snorkel with. The management at The Four Seasons responded quickly and provided us with some extra accommodations to make up for this. They also arranged a very late checkout as we had a 930pm flight home the last night, very thoughtful.    The poolside/beachside service is impeccable - attentive staff to keep your drink fresh, and ensure you are comfortable. They even brought over a towel to rest my elbows on when I wanted to read in the pool, true luxury. The resort was overall very quiet, the hotel wasn't that busy just a few days after opening, but the staff said they expect a full house in just a few weeks.    The restaurants, while expensive, all delivered delicious food. We did drive into Kona (about a 20 minute drive) for one dinner to save a little money, as the meals add up.    I also played golf at a course nearby, as the full rate for playing the on property course is about $350 - there are others in the area for about half that cost I recommend. The Hualalai course did look immaculate though.    Lastly I highly recommend going over to Kukio Beach for snorkeling. Its a 15 minute walk or 3 minute golf cart ride. You can request a ride by talking to the concierge. All snorkel gear, drinks, snacks at the beach are provided by the hotel, and the area is full of beautiful fish and even sea turtles to swim with.

Have visited all of the Hawaiian islands and the location of this resort and the available activities on and off the property is the best of any of the Hawaiian Islands.  Restaurants have a great variety of food, service is impeccable, breakfast buffet is superb.  The pools and beach areas are gorgeous, never crowded. Yes it is not a true sandy beach for swimming, but you can see sea turtles right on the beach and breaching whales and Spinner dolphins just offshore. And the protected area is fun to swim in. Snorkeling in Kings Pond is a must-do. The other pools are perfect for swimming and family activities.  The sports centre is immense- huge well equipped gym, tennis courts,bocce ball, ping pong.  Rooms are large, clean, excellent house keeping service. Our room was always cleaned by the time we finished morning activities.  They will arrange a wide variety of off property activities.

750552049,20,Dinner Disaster at Four Seasons,"Tonight we went to have a 75th birthday celebration on the beach at the Four Seasons - Hualalai. Drinks at the bar before were awesome. Great service and staff. Then we were seated in the back of the restaurant where we eventually got drinks and service. It was slow but even paced. After ordering we had some items split on two plates. Other split items had to be passed across the table. When the wrong meal was served to 2 of the six of us the server stopped in the middle of wine service to deal with it. Glad she left the wine bottle on the bench so at least we could serve ourselves.  She never showed back up until after the food initially served wrong was replaced almost 15 minutes later. Never a word of apology. The manager did stop by, apologize and comp those two meals. She then came back as if nothing ever happened. We still had to have a birthday desert that tasted great, even as my wife and I are passing a plate back and forth across the table because couldn’t figure out how to split a tart in two. The server assistants seemed to have a hard time finding the right table or caring if they did or not.  Bottom line. The food was great. The service was no where up to the standards of any Four Seasons we have ever been to. I’ve had better service in a roadside burger joint.",Mar 2020,March 2020,Traveled with friends,,

The pools are great, including infinity and salt water. It was disappointing, as a child was hanging out at the adult pool, and staff did not say anything, but...we did it at the end of the trip. If you are not going to spend the day lounging around the facilities, I would say not worth the price.

748950696,30,3 star stay - 5 star expectations,"We were so excited to come stay at the #1 resort in the US (based on US News), the Four Seasons Hualalai. We were curious as to how this resort would compare to our experience at the Four Seasons Oahu, where we had spent the last few days; in Oahu, noise levels were an issue but service and food were both 5 stars. We figured that the Hualalai resort would take it up a notch.    The location and ocean front property is untouchable,  but views alone don’t make you #1. The food and beverage program didn’t wow us, especially at the pool where we paid $33 for a dry, cold chicken ceasar salad. It was noticeable immediately that modern touches and upgrades to the rooms were lacking, and the service was only mediocre. I was confused about this being the #1 resort, but upon checking to see some reviews, realized it had just dropped to #16 on the list and #3 in Hawaii (previously #1 in both)!! I am typically not one to care about ratings like this, but that’s a big drop. How do you not strive to maintain your position, let alone lose a spot in the top 10?    After check in we ordered drinks to our room to celebrate our arrival, it took 40min for them to arrive. At Ulu, during dessert, our soufflé was forgotten, after we waited 45min. We were told they ran out, but with two flavors available, and the restaurants mostly empty, it wasn’t adding up. The next day we got back to our room after a day at the pool and the room was still not cleaned at 2pm. We had to call to ask for service...    For us the worst offense was that we requested a late check out several times, and when we called to confirm this was ok, we were told that our room was already re-booked and it wouldn’t be possible due to the hotel being at full capacity (obviously not true). In conversation with a staff member they confirmed the hotel was only at roughly 65% capacity and said they would see what they could do. We eventually got the late check-out approved, but the bad taste was already there - we didn’t need an excuse about re-booking and there was no need for the blatant lie regarding occupancy.    Coming from the San Francisco Bay Area, living in a luxury full-service building, traveling to the top hotels in the world, we know what luxury looks and feels like. At the Four Seasons Oahu, the staff went above and beyond to meet our every need, even driving us to a beach outside of their “typical” shuttle range.  At the Four Seasons Hualalai, while the staff is quick to chat up their “regulars”, there appears no sense of urgency otherwise. This resort is missing the modern touches that one comes to expect at a 5 star resort; it’s missing the “wow” factor in its food and beverage program, and it’s missing the untouchable service that most hotels of this caliber easily execute on. This leaves me wondering, what has happened here?",Mar 2020,March 2020,Traveled as a couple,,
748782437,50,A Fairytale 50th Birthday,"From the moment we booked our room, it felt like our vacation began. I downloaded the app and easily spoke to a team of concierges and guest support. They cared what time we landed, helped us arrange the type of transport to/from the hotel that was right for us/our budget, and greeted us in the lobby with an artful, local display of nibbles and drinks on a tray. We were over the moon. The property feels residential and intimate, with no building being over two stories tall. We were in the adult pool ""horseshoe"" of rooms, which was quiet and fabulous. Our room was relaxed luxury, and every arrival amenity that I had asked for for my fiance's 50th was lovingly cared for and presented. I felt like the Four Seasons made me look so good! We snorkeled, we took naps in the hammock, we vegged out on room service and a movie in the ridiculously comfortable bed, we played tennis on the marvelous courts almost every day, the pros were gentle and knowledgeable, we got drinks at the swim up bar, and we topped it all off with a birthday blessing by Ali'i down by the water and a Chef's dinner at Chef Thomas' table at Ulu, which was 6 courses never to be forgotten. The staff was friendly and warm. There when you needed them, totally gone when you didn't. If I could say one thing about this property and our experience, it was that everyone gave what they were doing 110%. Whether it was making a perfect mai tai or helping with towels or giving us a cold rag after tennis, the service and care was above and beyond. We loved it, and even though we went for my partner's birthday, we are now talking about an annual trip. I can't recommend this property enough.

Staff (special thanks to Rebecca) went above and beyond to accommodate us (except one Spanish guy at the breakfast with a bit of attitude) and we appreciated the little touches for our babymoon! We have never seen such a starry sky and it was a tranquil paradise from the layout of our room, territory around, pools and everything else at the highest level. Just wish it had a less rocky beach but I guess you can't expect that in Big Island.

747467785,40,One star short of a 5 star,"I have stayed at many of the high end resorts on the big  island but this is the prettiest property of them all. The grounds are both lushly landscaped and incredibly maintained. I love the beaches even if they are not swimming ones. There is something mesmerizing about watching the constant ebb and flow of the waves as they sweep over the lava rocks. The staff meets the usual incredibly high standards of every Four Seasons I have stayed in, a lot of energy, genuinely warm smiles, an attitude of what can be done to make our stay even better and an appreciation of having the best job in the world at the best place in the world. We were a bit disappointed in the room. We paid $1,500 a night for a room that was oceanfront. It seemed smaller than its advertised 635 square feet and did not have a feel of being a luxury room as one would expect. It was dark and not furnished to the chain’s standards. Timely housekeeping was an issue as well. Be forewarned that you have to get to the beach or pool by 7:30 to choose your chair or you may be disappointed. They have a policy that outlaws holding chairs but it is ignored. Numerous times I saw people claiming the “best” chairs at 7:00 am but not occupy them until 11:00 or 12:00. There are 4 excellent restaurants open for dinner which I thought was a strong point. I hate being at a secluded resort where you keep going back to the same restaurant or two with the same menu. Even still, you need to make advance dinner reservations as the restaurants seem to fill up quickly for the prime hours.",Feb 2020,February 2020,Traveled as a couple,,"Los Angeles, California"

746440214,40,Great trip overall....some issues 😟,"Just completed a 6 night stay. Overall a BEAUTIFUL resort, weather perfect, staff helpful, attentive service...but should still be even better - since it’s 4 seasons.    So I’ve started at 4S Wailea, Maui. Phenomenal. This resort is good, but needs more work. If I compare - Wailea was much better.    Housekeeping - rooms need to be cleaned better and extra touches need to be there! Also, it takes FOREVER to get wine glasses or any other amenities you need delivered. Cleaning of rooms should be better.    Food - is good at all the restaurants but WATCH YOUR BILL! We were overcharged on 2 separate occasions. How can you charge for 4 glasses of wine (when you only had 2) OR on a separate bill charge for an extra entree!!?? Do not know if these are innocent mistakes or preying on drunk guests? Hmmmmm....check your bill! Did speak to the manger Bonnie about this - was a weird encounter.    Tours - are way overpriced - try to book on your own.    Exercise area - lovely facilities - but all machines should be working - not the case.    Overall - it’s a lovely place. Beautiful location. Amazing. But for the amount one pays for an ocean view - it should be perfection. It was not.

741354693,50,Spectacular Wedding Anniversary @ Four Seasons Hualalai,"This is long, long overdue given my stay was in October and it's been on my to-do list since we had the pleasure of being guests here. All I have to say is wow, it's worth mentioning when the service is just above and beyond in ways I won't be able to capture fully with words. My wife and I came here for a special wedding anniversary, and went all-in. This place deserves to be in a class of it's own. From the outstanding service to the people to the privacy to the availability of amenities to the fitness areas to the food to the private dining. I've never been so happy to splurge and ready to come back - and now we are, for another special occasion in March. That says it all because we typically like to explore new places - but perhaps never again in Hawaii - this resort is like a magnet, nailed it - and you really can't just stay anywhere else, IMO. What did it? I just kept coming back to the FEELINGS I had that were evoked when we were there - and this literally is the best place I've ever stayed. The service clearly an art here: it is just so well balanced - personal but not over the top, private but not deserted, high quality with a special touch of feeling home. So, THANK YOU Hualalai Four Seasons for making that happen - and we'll see you in March! Extra special shout out to Sebastian for setting us up and the incredible private dining experience trio: Extraordinary Planner Victoria, Exquisite Chef Michael, and to Charismatic Pro Tyson overseeing our service and bringing it home! If you haven't done the private dining, I'd say give it a go - you won't be disappointed, I can assure you. Just to show some balance in this review, if only for the purposes of grounded practicality, what could be better? Hmmmm.. well sure, I think the rooms are ready for some updating, but that's only if you don't like the era they were updated, because they are immaculately maintained, not run down at all, amazing lanais, and the beds are incredibly comfortable. Perhaps I've just contracted myself - eh, who cares - what more do you need? Wish there was a 6-star review, I'd give it here :) !!!",Jan 2020,October 2019,,,"San Francisco, California"
740146868,50,Heaven on earth and beautiful beaches,"Our experience here was just amazing. How do you describe a perfect haven?    Imagine this: its a beautiful spring evening. 70 something degrees out. The sun is about to set. You leave your cabin to go to one of several restaurants on the resort, the beach, or off site dining. The atmosphere is quiet, but you hear the waves crashing in the near distance. The sky is a masterpiece, painting the sunset. The many torches along the pathways have been lit. I mean, the place just looks magical. You're in heaven. If you came here by passport, you may be tempted to throw it in the sea, just so it'd delay your return home- only to be disappointed by your Embassy's passport services.    You cannot beat the service at Four Seasons. This review just seems pointless because I am echoing what everyone else is saying. PERFECTION. We booked on Expedia, our room was ""Prime with Ocean View"" and included a daily $100 credit, for a total of $500 credit. You can use this as a cumulative amount, meaning if you did not use up your credits on one day, it would roll into another day. The food at the hotel is phenomenal but, of course, its extremely pricey - as that is typical for Four Seasons.    Beaches: The beaches in this part of Kailua Kona are beautiful. For those that compare the islands of Hawaii based on the beaches they offer - they may say Big Island has the worst beaches. My opinion, that is simply not true, especially when you stay at or near the Four Seasons hotel. The beach is a beautiful white sands. Kiholo Bay is close by- with tons of turtles. Its one of many beautiful beaches. The area has alot of lava rock in its landscape and makes it all that more scenic.    Having a rental car is a must. You stay on the Big Island to explore, as well as relax. Take a drive to the wetter Hilo and purchase tickets to the Hawaii Tropical Botanical Gardens there. Experience a beautiful rain forest through a walk way that takes you to the edge of one of its beaches. Walking out to waves crashing onto Onomea Bay takes you back to the explorer days before the island was ""discovered"". The boardwalk takes you to a scenic view of this Bay, with its caverns, beach and crabs, and the Twin Rocks vista.",Jan 2020,March 2019,,,"Saint Louis, Missouri"
739647106,50,Luxury and Warmth at the Big Island Four Season!,"We stayed at the Four Seasons Hualalai in September 2019. This property is beautiful and only 2 stories tall for a very private feel. It is spread out beautifully so most every room has a view of the water and has privacy! The rooms are very large and appointed perfectly. The ground floor rooms have a connecting private outdoor shower and the 2nd floor rooms have amazing views! The bathroom is huge with large separate tub and nice powerful shower. There are 3 wonderful pool areas and the pool attendants come around with frozen snacks for the kids and frozen alcohol drinks/pops for the adults. Since this is the Four Seasons, there is no additional charge for a cabana set-up by the pool or on the beach or for a chair and umbrella like you find at other hotels! The meals at all the restaurants on the property were very delicious! If you want just a small snack or easy breakfast and latte, you can order and eat outside of the Trading Co/Store near the gym/tennis courts. They also sell wine and snacks. Tip: The Island Gourmet grocery in the Waikoloa area (about 10minutes) up the road has a large wine selection at much lower prices and prepared food and groceries. The inside/outside gym is very, very well equipped and there is a lap pool near the gym area. The Spa is beautiful! They have cold/hot plunge pools, sauna, steam rooms that you can use regardless of getting a spa service. The entire staff constantly greets you as you are walking around the property.

The setting perfect. The facilities (i.e. pools/rooms/fitness areas) pristine.    For the huge $$$$$ costs, you would expect near perfection. And the property nearly met our very high expectations.    Our issue was with some of the staff. We didn't feel that the staff (especially the concierge staff) went out of their way to accommodate our minor requests. For example, my wife requested that the concierge change our dinner reservations from 5:30 pm to 7 pm at one of the resort's restaurants, and the concierge essentially told my wife to do it herself. Really? Plus there were a few other minor staff issues (too many work trucks during the day on the walking paths which constantly requiring that we get out of the way of speeding golf carts/etc).    For a 5 star property with $$$$$ prices, the place should operate flawlessly.    Is it the best place on the Big Island to stay? Absolutely.    Is it perfect? No.    Worthy of the best hotel in the USA for 2019 (as so rated by US News and World Report)? No. Close though.    --    Suggestion to management -- > continue to work with the staff.

I traveled here 17 years ago when my daughter was ten weeks old. I wanted to show my two teenagers (17 and 15) old one of my favorite places. We were traveling to Hawaii for a wedding and were only able to spend one night in the Four Seasons. We reserved our room through Amex Platinum so we could benefit from the amenities offered with the card.    We arrived at the property and greeted with two alcoholic drinks. It was not a big deal, but the person checking us in seemed annoyed that it was one person with two teenagers. Our room was not ready, but we could use the property. Not a big deal once again, but we had a wedding at 3:30. We used the facilities, showered in the spa, and took our room keys before we could look at the room.    We went to the wedding and returned quite late and discovered that we had one of the furthermost rooms away from everything on the property. Not a huge deal, but the Four Seasons forgot about our upgrade through Amex platinum. My teenagers love the pool and the ocean, and it was quite a trek to get to everything. I mentioned upon check out that we were not upgraded to a better room, and we were told, “oh, I am sorry.” once again, not a huge deal, but this is our vacation. I could have booked via booking and saved a lot of money for the same room. We booked through Amex so we could have the upgraded room.    The property itself is gorgeous! The spa is beautiful, and the workout room is terrific! We loved the saltwater pool with a ton of fantastic fish and rays! The restaurants are excellent, and the staff is fantastic! I have stayed in a lot of Four Seasons, and this is one of the better ones.    I will return to this property, but I will not leave before looking at our room.

As our room was having a maintenance issue and we could not check in on time they upgraded us to the huge Milo Suite. The room was more than we needed but a real treat. They also gave us a bottle of Prosecco and some chocolates. Now this is customer service! The view from this suite gorgeous and in a quiet location behind the adult only Palm Grove pool. Although not a swimming beach we enjoyed lounging at the Beach Tree pool that was carved out of lava rock. Pool service by Kelly and team was super with lots of chilled water being offered throughout the day. We enjoyed lunch at the Resident's Beach Club. The poke, pizza and wine list great! Dinner at Ulu so memorable. Sitting ocean front, watching the sunset, taking in the fresh air so relaxing. The menu here so creative hard to choose. We dined on the freshest salads, sushi and fish entrees. We were then presented with a special dessert as they knew we were celebrating my husband's birthday! The breakfast buffet is amazing with everything one could want. Don't miss the macadamia sticky buns! Upon leaving the general manager made a point to ask us how everything was and say goodbye.The Four Seasons Hualalali is pretty much perfection!

721906408,50,"Absolutely stunning, incredible service -- expensive, but worth it.","I recently got married at Hualalai and had the most incredible vacation with my friends and family. We were somewhat reluctant at first to want to select Hualalai as our venue because the rates might be cost prohibitive for some. After a week-ish in paradise with many of our best friends and family however, we have no regrets with regard to choosing Hualalai for our entirely magical stay.    The sprawling property features several very different and unique pools that make it feel like you are taking vacations within the vacation even after staying on property for several days. While I often get bored just staying at one resort all day and as a result tend to choose vacation destinations with off-resort activities, Hualalai is such a dream that it feels like an absolute chore to leave. Its really somewhat unfortunate, because it would have been great to see more of the many things that the Big Island offers - but we had such an awesome time staying at Hualalai. We absolutely did not want to leave.    Above all else, what really sets Hualalai apart is the service. Each evening our phone charging cables were meticulously folded and the house cleaners came twice a day to replace and/or fold linens. I had left a bag by accident at the hotel pool restaurant and it was immediately returned to me -- I don't even really know how they knew it was mine!    All of my wedding guests who stayed at Hualalai shared similar experiences, many were initially apprehensive to stay there because of the cost, but now I think swear by the Four Seasons brand and will probably be clients for life... All the little details -- the friendly staff that always say Aloha, the amazing bathroom soaps and the immaculately appointed rooms -- it all makes it 100% worth it.    The spa was also fantastic. I only used the shower and the steam room there, but if I had stayed longer I would have sprung for a massage. DEFINITELY check out the spa area if you go... they have several indoor and outdoor showers, a really uniquely designed steam room and cold and hot plunge pools - all located off a peaceful outdoor courtyard. It was magical.    As far as my experience planning the wedding itself, that was also a breeze. Working with Marissa was a pleasure and she definitely helped allay some of my concerns about cost. She was patient, organized and prompt to reply to my questions and requests. She also was very thorough in going over the ins and outs of each estimate, even with my sometimes demanding and hard pressing parents... Definitely stress relieving when you are spending so much money on one day. The food for the event was outstanding - many of my guests exclaimed that it was the best wedding food they'd ever had. The in house florist, Heidi, was also terrific. Her tropical designs were so unique and beautiful, I couldn't have dreamt of more gorgeous arrangements. I felt so special and honored to carry the bouquet she made for me, it was the most beautiful bouquet I'd ever seen! I felt like absolute royalty.    I couldn't recommend this resort higher both for a vacation and hosting an event. Everything was amazing and despite the high price tag, the value you receive makes it totally worth it.    Final note, downstairs rooms have outdoor showers, which I, for one, really enjoy -- so pro-tip: request a downstairs room if possible, you will not be disappointed :)",Oct 2019,October 2019,,Chose a downstairs room to get an outdoor shower,"Washington DC, District of Columbia"
720749262,50,The single best resort ever stayed at,I didn’t think I would ever stay at a resort that literally had everything covered and handled every issue like we were the most important customer they had. We had only a couple issues that were small but they more than made up for them. They have already thought of everything from water socks for the ocean to sunglasses cleaners making rounds. Having stayed at a lot of luxury hotels I was getting tired of paying extra for the same service and detail of 4 star hotels and was about to start staying at those instead. This resort changed that. They covered everything all the time. The competence of every single employee shocked me no matter what their job title. Will definitely be back and recommend to anyone. The island is definitely slower than others but we like that.,Oct 2019,October 2019,Traveled with family,,
720490834,40,Lovely stay,"When booking our honeymoon, we had 3 people tell us this was their favorite hotel in the world so we had very high expectations. My husband and I love staying at luxury properties so we were excited to end our honeymoon here. We let the hotel know that we would be flying in from the Four Seasons Bora Bora overnight and landed very early around 8am. We were exhausted when we landed and were hoping our room would be ready. We were greeted by a very friendly man who gave us upgrade options (with a price) I think we were so delirious we just went ahead a did it. We booked with Amex so we were hoping for a 12PM checkin. We unfortunately didn't get our room until 3PM so were a bit frustrated about that. Of course we realize the hotel has until 3PM so not much we can do although knowing it was our honeymoon weeks in advance and we had been traveling it would've been nice to get in a room earlier. The hotel did seem full though so we would like to think the staff did what they could. All of the staff was so friendly especially the staff at the adult pool. My husband did think the front desk staff he interacted with during checkin were not as friendly. We did have welcome champagne for our honeymoon which was very nice. The rooms themselves are very outdated. To be honest our friends that let us know this was their favorite hotel hadn't been there since high school (10 years ago) so it made sense at that point. The views, food and pools were great but the rooms definitely need some love put into them. Our room had a musty smell. Our last night we were running late and the concierge help get the restaurant to deliver food to our room before it closed which was so kind. The food itself was okay, we liked breakfast the most!

715343003,50,Resort Perfection,"I’m a Four Seasons loyalist and have stayed at over 12 of their properties around the world and this is still my favorite property. However, I’m somewhat biased because I was married on this property under the wedding tree in 2010. On a return recently, almost 10 years after our wedding, the stay here continues to be perfect. The staff ensure each stay is elevated to levels that exceed all expectations.    Meals here are so good you won’t want to leave the property. The Beachtree never disappoints and I highly recommend the beat salad, the fish of the day in the evening and sharing the banana split for dessert. The Palm Grove pool provides my favorite poolside meal that I still dream about. They do a simple fish and chips but it’s executed perfectly and served with a malt vinegar tarter that we now try to replicate at home. The bartenders at this pool are also fantastic. The guy working there during our recent stay was able to replicate any drink I asked for flawlessly with ease and was always the perfect level of chatty—not too much, not too little.    Resort activities will provide everything you need to keep busy. King’s Pond snorkeling is a treat for those who aren’t strong swimmers and the spa is top notch in their services offered. The spa facilities also provide great indoor and outdoor relaxation areas and showers. The on-site store is very reasonably priced and has everything you might need or want during your trip.    Service at this hotel is always perfect and I am someone that is very quick to critique top end hotels. While most Four Seasons are top notch, I use this Four Seasons as my bar for quality.

As you would expect the grounds, rooms and experiences are 6 star and when you offer this to your guests, the devil is in the detail. And this they impress with the most. Staff only ask your name once and for the rest of the stay they address you by name, they remember the drink you ordered, where you like to sit and what time to ask you if you’d like lunch. They are friendly but not intrusive in anyway. The perfect balance. It is also super easy to contact staff through their messenger app, their response time never over 3 minutes. We were super impressed to find washing machines and dryers for guests’ own use - particularly as my husband came straight from a 2 week business trip.  We have two teenagers and Miss 11 and there was plenty for them to keep busy.  The gym area of the resort is incredible and there are plenty of tennis courts to have a hit.

Service at the pools and beach were top-notch; always a friendly smile ready to help or serve at anytime.    The resort has a reputation for being kind to the environment and landscaping features local, non-invasive species. It was all beautiful and all wonderfully maintained.    Food/drink was good with a wide variety of offerings around the property.    The top notch property has top notch prices to match. This is especially true of the accomodations which are more than double nearby resorts on the Kohala coast. But for the price, you get exclusivity, great friendly customer service everywhere, and a high staff:guest ratio. For me, it was worth splurging here.    The resort is super-photogenic. Every view is Instagram-worthy; and like other Hawaii Island west coast resorts, the best sunset views in the world are here.

705763477,30,Great Staff but the property is tired,"It was a rough start to a quick vacation getaway. We decided at the last minute to jump on a plane out of San Francisco and head over to the Big Island for a few days. Having stayed at the Four Seasons Maui the last two trips we decided to give the Hualalai Four Seasons a try. We arrived around 2pm and while going through the check-in process we were offered an upgraded suite for an additional $700/night. We decided to preview our original room and the suite upgrade so we took a quick ride with the bellman to look at both rooms. Our original room was ready for us and looked fine, but after seeing the suite we decided the additional space would be nice to have for the next 4 nights. The bellman left the luggage in the suite (because it was ready) and we were told we need to go to the front desk to complete the check-in. Once back in the lobby we were told the suite would be officially ready in about 30 minutes (the room was clean and ready but needed a final inspection before we could have the keys). We decided to go have some lunch and come back later. After 90 minutes we went to get the keys (it was now 3:45pm) and were told the room would be ready soon. It was very hot and we were still in the same cloths we flew in...not dressed for the beach and heat. Not wanting to wait any longer we asked for the keys to our original room and cancelled the upgrade (which would have meant an additional $3,000 for the hotel). If the hotel could not get the room inspected within 90 minutes of our arrival, it wasn't worth it. We weren't in our room 5 minutes before the manager called to let us know that the suite was now ready (it was like magic). We declined, and decided to stay put. I will say that the manager was very nice and her service recovery was excellent. She offered to buy us dinner for the mishap and was very gracious in the way she handled the situation.  The room we were given was just okay by Four Seasons standards. The furniture was worn, the baseboards are banged up and dusty, and the mattresses did not seem to be the same as we have experienced at other Four Seasons. We bought our mattress for home from the Four Seasons in Palo Alto, CA after staying at the Four Seasons Maui and wanting to own the same mattress. We recently stayed at the Four Seasons Baltimore, Boston and San Francisco and all seemed to have the same beds. 10 minutes after being in the room there was a knock on the door and engineering showed up to repair the screen door (which we did not know was broken). It made me wonder how this room was supposedly ready for us, but the suite was not??  We were on a breakfast package and chose to have the buffet each morning. In comparing the buffet to the Maui Four Seasons, there is no comparison. The Hualalai resort served a very lack luster buffet.Waffles were cold, no pancakes feshly made, only 1 flavor of syrup (versus 3+ at Maui), fruit offerings were not visually appealing, and the person at the omelet station was gone more than she was there. 3 different times I stood at the omelet station for more than a few minutes without anyone to make me some eggs. Because we had an early tee time for golf, we showed up for breakfast at 6:35 am to eat one morning. Many of the items were not yet out and most of the items which were out did not have any serving spoons set up yet. It was 6:45 before the buffet was actually ready for service. I wanted a bowl of granola, but there weren't any spoons to scoop it with for 10 plus minutes. 6:45 is 15 minutes past the time the restaurant opens. As a business owner with a chain of retail locations, being late is unacceptable. When the doors open the restaurant should be ready for customers. While we are not a ""food focused"" couple, we did notice how significantly different the buffet was compared to the other islands. The little things that make you feel like you are at a special place with exceptional service just seemed to be missing. For example, Maui FS staff cover your plate with a wicker plate cover to keep the birds off your food if you get up to go get something else at the buffet. At Hualalai you are on your own. We watched one table next to ours get covered with birds the minute the people got up to go back to the buffet, and the wait staff just walked around the table as if nothing was happening. My wife and I simply took turns to stand guard so that didn't happen.  On our second day we spent some time at the adult pool, and on our 3rd day we chose to go to the ""quiet"" pool because the adult pool was filled with overly loud obnoxious people who can't seem to talk at a level to keep their conversations between themselves and the people they are speaking to. Everyone at the adult pool got the entire conversation of the few loud and drunk people. At the quiet pool on day 3 we deiced to order a pizza that was on the menu of the adult pool, and we were told that it wouldn't be a problem to get one brought to our pool (I guess they have different menus). The order never got put in and after 45 minutes we asked when the pizza would be here and we were told it had never been ordered. The waiter who we placed the order with didn't even offer an apology.  Any of these things by themselves would never add up to giving a 3 star review, but there seemed to be many little mishaps along the way that all added up to it being a lackluster experience..  On the positive side, we really enjoyed the dinner at Ulu Grill and the Hualalai Grill. The wait staff at both of those restaurants were great and the food was very excellent. The golf course was in perfect condition and the staff at the golf course was excellent as well.  My takeaways are these:    Pros: The staff, bellmen, golf course attendants, etc.. were all positive and helpful. The grounds and landscaping are gorgeous, and the location is idyllic.    Cons: The buildings are old, and the furnishings are tired. The organization of the staff needs improvement in order to offer a better experience. Four Seasons needs to invest in this old property if they are going to compete at the high end. The Mauna Lani is opening in January as an Auberge resort, and Rosewood is build a high end luxury resort right next to FS which will open in 2022. Mauna Kea recently did a full remodel and the Hapuna Westin did as well. FS sets their prices as if they do not have competition...but they do and will have more very soon.",Sep 2019,August 2019,,,"Sydney, Australia"

Everything about this report has been designed to give you comfort and luxury without taking away from the natural beauty of the Kona coast or the magic of the Big Island.

When arriving at Big Island one here in Hualalai, I had to say this is by far the best I ever had . It is primitive style with extraordinary garden and pools. The beach is just a step from the bungalow style of guest rooms. No matter garden view or ocean view are unforgettable experience .

703332741,30,"A beautiful property, but missed the mark","We visited FS Hualalai for our anniversary after so many people had recommended the property. The resort is huge — 3 pools, hot tubs, restaurants and plenty of beach access. The grounds are nicely manicured and the staff is friendly and accommodating for the most part. Overall, the resort is nice, but it fell short in a lot of ways for us, especially considering the price. I think the bottom line is that it’s just so expansive that it’s hard to deliver luxury every single time, which is what we’ve come to expect from FS. When we checked into our room, it smelled horribly of mold and housekeeping agreed. Unfortunately, their remedy to this was installing a humidifier into our room and essential oils, which is nice but when you’re paying $900/night a super noisy dehumidifier isn’t ideal. The next morning they had a room available and transferred us, which was nice but meeting with the front desk, packing up, transferring our luggage, etc took a good part of our morning and could have been avoided had they dealt with it the day before. We had our best meal at the Grill in both food and service. We loved the menu at Beachtree, but it was swarming with kids who were dancing on the tables, screaming and running back and forth through tables to the surrounding lawn on our first night. We decided to eat there on our last night and our food came 1. With the wrong order and 2. Cold. The manager was gracious but we had already lost our appetite. As a side note, there is also very noisy construction happening near King’s Pond that we weren’t aware of prior to booking. This is definitely a family resort, which is great, but don’t come expecting solitude or luxury. Having stayed at many other FS properties both in the islands and elsewhere, we were disappointed.",Aug 2019,August 2019,Traveled as a couple,,"Honolulu, Hawaii"
703321034,30,Disappointing and not worth the $$$,"We stayed here for a coupe of nights after staying at the Mauna Kea for a few nights. We were expecting it to be the highlight of our stay at 3 different locations on the Big Island - the last was a lodge in Volcano, HI.  Unfortunately it was our least favorite spot on the island. We were expecting a unique experience and something a bit magical for the price point but it was neither of those things. It was pretty, but definitely not unique nor magical.  First off, it's tight. Everything feels squeezed in. There are no big vistas as everything is low and there is no elevation change to the resort. You are right on top of your neighbors. This was a huge difference between FS and the Mauna Kea. What we loved about the Mauna Kea the FS could just not compete with.  The beach was a huge letdown after the Mauna Kea resort. We knew they weren't known for the beach going in but didn't expect it to be such a disappointment. It felt like we were tripping over people.  This is a pretty resort that feels like it could be anywhere, very formulaic. It's all about the pools and they are lined up along the waterfront in between the restaurants.  The restaurants are not great. They are definitely not worth the price. I paid $35 for a plate of linguine with very overcooked seafood.  The staff were very friendly for the most part (but not all). Chris (the tall, slim one) at the pool was fantastic! A true credit to the resort.  The rooms were just ok - again, not worth the price point. I missed our amazing room at the Mauna Kea that was half the price of this room. It was so well designed and very spacious and private. We actually had a golf view room at the Mauna Kea and an ocean view at the FS too so that says a lot.  For the record, we are more than able to pay for a resort such as this so it's not that we are uncomfortable with the cost, just uncomfortable paying for something that is clearly not worth it.  It's interesting that this resort gets such high reviews. I don't get it. I wonder if it's because it's full of Four Seasons devotees who don't stay anywhere else?  It definitely did not capture the essence of Hawaii. We won't be back.",Aug 2019,August 2019,,,los angeles
702687047,40,"Very nice resort, some minor hiccups.","First and foremost, I want to thank the families who chose to leave their nannies at home thinking everyone else will be watching their children. Because of them, the family pool was closed on multiple occasions. Closed more often than it was open during our stay. If you can’t tell when your future masters of the universe is having tummy trouble, you should make sure you travel with someone who can.    Beach is visually appealing, but it’s not really a swimmer’s beach and therefore not a substitute for the pool being closed. While I appreciate the resort making sure that the rest of us would not get sick from this, they could have handled the guests complaining around the quiet pool better. They should have offered to set them up around the adults only pool while the families were sent to the quiet pool. We were told numerous times between 3:40 and 3:59 that the family pool will reopen at 4:00. My standard response was that it was not 4:00 yet. They need a better protocol for handling brown outs.    The breakfasts were great, both the buffet and the individual meals. After a bad experience on our first night at the Barefoot (cold risotto and watery pizza sauce), we chose to pay the ride share tax and eat in Kona and Waikoloa the rest of the trip.    As expected, the service is top notch. Housekeeping and the turndown service were great. Check-in was welcoming. The little treats around the pool like the frozen grapes and alcohol blue raspberry ice pops were nice touches. My son to advantage of the camp to take his first surf lessons in Kona at a black sand beach. A really cool experience for him.    Rooms were spacious and well appointed. We especially enjoyed having the outdoor shower in our bathroom, the robes and the human sized toiletries. Surprised to find a toaster in with the coffee maker. Turned to my son and said “good thing we bought Pop Tarts at the store.” Only room complaint was the thermostat. We could not get the room down to our comfortable sleeping temperature of 66 degrees. I know resorts are trying to be eco-friendly, but with a good amount of the island’s power coming from renewables they should be concentrating more on conserving water than the electricity.    Aside from the pools issue, another great Four Seasons experience.",Aug 2019,August 2019,Traveled with family,,"Morristown, New Jersey"
701668628,50,#1 Resort in Hawaii,"The #1 resort in Hawaii hands down, ok, Koele Four seasons on Lanai is a close second, but there’s no beach there! Hualalai Is on my least favorite island, but for couples, families, anyone this is where it’s at. From the moment you pull up at valet, there is always someone attentive, welcoming you, and ready to help get you to vacay mode! They will lei you, Hawaiian style to welcome you to their property! The check in process is nice, you don’t need to stand at a counter, they seat you and your family on a couch and serve the adults a mai tai (alcohol mixed with POG) and the kids POG (passion orange guava mix) in coconuts and cool refreshing towels, confirm the details, take your cc, and you are on your way. The property is a little spread out, we arrived at night, and though our room wasn’t far from the lobby, they shuttles us there on golf carts, my kids always enjoy that part! They happened to upgrade us, pleasant surprise, and since it was our anniversary there was champagne, desserts, and toys for our kids. The room was such a treat for our family of 4, it was a one bedroom suite, but the couch pulled out and since we arrived at night, the bed was already made. We had two bathrooms, the one in the living room had a shower, the one in the bedroom had a tub, a shower, and a fabulous rock wall, rock step OUTDOOR shower! The closet was a small walk in with ample space for all of our bags! The breakfast is phenomenal at Ulu Grill! Buffet breakfast with everything you can think of, an omelette bar, fruits galore (exotic ones too) meats, oatmeal, miso soup (Japanese breakfast) pancakes, waffles, and matcha lattes, coffee, and a kids bar with tater tots, confetti waffles, eggs! The water activities are supreme here and endless!!!! The property is fronted by a swimmable beach and it’s protected by the reef, so it’s safer for the kids, I saw a canoe in the little protected cove as well, there are also rocks/reef that have formed tide pools, and where my 4 year old wanted to frolick and hang the whole day looking for little fish, sea animals and playing with the torpedo fish the hotel gifted him. There are so many pools, one that’s for adults only, much quieter and next to a restaurant we never ate at since we have kids, although it was really good the last time we visited. A short walk away there is a ping pong table, and a water activities desk, I’m sure you could rent snorkels, tubes, water gear although we failed to visit during this trip, and right next to this is another pool with a waterfall, Tahitian hut that covers the jacuzzi, and a short distance away a kids pool with sand on one end, little sun chairs and mini umbrellas for the littles! They also had a mini kid bar, complete with Mac and cheese, chicken fingers, fruits for $12ish close the towel stand and kiddie pool. The night we were there, a Friday summer night they set up an inflatable screen, popcorn maker, candies at the bar and you could swim and watch the movie after sunset at the pool. The last pool, Kings pool is our absolute favorite!!! It’s a salt water heaven of fishes and an eagle ray that you get to snorkel, snuba, or swim with! There are feeding fish times you can participate in, they have a touch pool where you can hold brittle stars, sea cucumbers, and other sea animals and if you get there a little before they open around 10 am and sign in before the spaces fill up, you can personally feed the eagle ray (sting ray no stinger) the kids loved this experience it made the whole trip! We ate at Ulu for dinner, I have another review just about the restaurant, it was outstanding! There’s so much for every age to do here, I didn’t mention the gym, the golf course, most of all just the absolute beauty you are surrounded by! Sunsets are stunning here and life is perfect, worth the cost, to you won’t be disappointed you did!!!",Aug 2019,August 2019,Traveled with family,,"Honolulu, Hawaii"

The service at the resort was amazing (from the moment you pull up to the bell desk to the moment you leave). Everyone was super friendly and helpful. And the resort is so beautiful. It never seemed crowded. It was very relaxed. We stayed in bungalow 10 and it was perfect for our family. The room was not huge, but it had space enough for the four of us (the kids were on a pull out couch, which was small, but very comfortable). We had our own lanai with views of a pretty pond and the ocean. And the outdoor shower was a big hit with our kids! I loved that they have free laundry facilities on site (lots of them so they are near all rooms). That helps with packing when you travel with kids. And our kids loved snorkeling in Kings Pond and playing in the ocean pool and in the regular kids pool. We found great snorkeling along the beach past the resort and at the resort activity center . The concierge was great and helped us plans tons of activities on site and off site. We ate at all the restaurants and they were all good.

698201936,50,True luxury resort that will always exceed expectations,"First time to the Big Island after countless trips to the other islands of Hawaii and tropical destinations overseas. Our trip started with a favorite that we've known and visited, especially when traveling with little ones, The Fairmont. After three disappointing nights (see my review of Fairmont Orchid), we cancelled the rest of the stay and headed to Four Seasons, which we've also known and loved as a family. The contrast between the two resorts was astounding even with the same ratings. Time after time, Four Seasons simply exceeds expectations in every aspect of the experience. Instead of fighting to get our car at the valet, we were greeted by name as we pulled up. Instead of standing in line to check in, we were led to a seating area in the lobby where the cold drinks and cold towels were ready. We checked in seated while everyone received beautiful leis. By the time we were finished, our luggage was already loaded onto the golf cart as the porter drove us to our room while making us feel at home once again. Facilities and rooms seem dated from the outside but once in the front door, the appointment and level of detail will take your breath away. The transitional progressive architecture oozes quality and class as the slate flooring blends seamlessly into the granite counter tops and stain grade maple and oak cabinets. Island style ceiling fans and working wood shutters contrast that of the dual 60"" flatscreen tv in our suite but the level of detail in the selection and placement of every piece of furniture, every bar of soap, all the way to where and how the robes are folded and hung is reminiscent of all the Four Seasons we've had the pleasure to stay at over the years. Bora Bora Four Seasons will always be our favorite in the world followed closely by Hualalai even exceeding the Four Seasons on Maui and Lanai. Pool lounging is always first class and the restaurants, oh goodness the restaurants, absolutely amazing. Staff always helpful, attentive, and genuine in their want to help you in any way to make your stay that much more pleasurable. Ulu is know as one of the best in the area and we now understand. It's the first time a restaurant that serves the daily breakfast buffet did not feel the same way when sitting down for an exclusive wine pairing dinner in the evening. Albeit none of the dishes was able to make it to our all time favorite list of best food in the world, the gorgeous view and sunsets made up for it. What started with a vacation ruined turned into one of the most memorable trips to the islands ever.

We reserved two golf-view rooms through American Express Platinum. Upon check in, I asked whether there were any room upgrades (which they're promised to provide upon availability) and I was told there was nothing available during my 13-day stay. I asked again -- nothing for 13 days? And I was told nothing. Yet, when I went online, I could book pool view and ocean view rooms during this time. I shared this and then received a call (after we arrived in our rooms) that they could move one room up in 5 days. They said nothing about the second room. Overall, they made me feel badly about asking for an upgrade. But why? It is part of the deal that they and I made with American Express. It would have been much nicer to have heard ""we'll do everything we can"" and get back to you, Instead, I felt the words they used and the attitude they had was ""nope; nothing, you silly woman"" and I had to push the matter.. And only after I pushed the matter, they offered the rooms. I shouldn't feel bad asking for an upgrade; And now I have to go back and ask about the second room -- they haven't offered. This is NOT the ""how can I help"" attitude that I'm used to at Four Seasons. Rather than embrace American Express clients, they made my request feel like a burden that annoys them.

The rooms however are smelly old, humid, dark, and look very tired. They are not comfortable period. The furniture is horrendous. 10, 000 people must have slept in the same bed as you and must have sat in the same sofa as you. The sofa belongs to the times of when Hawaii became a state of the US.

696694559,50,"Beautiful, amazing resort with a caveat","Recently spent four nights at the Four Seasons. The place is absolutely gorgeous, the service impeccable, and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Would give readers one word of warning, however. I originally booked via the Four Seasons website for an oceanfront room. We had stayed here once before perhaps 10 years ago and wanted the best room. Their website describes these rooms as mostly upstairs in the very front on the beach. It was quite expensive, but that wasn't a worry. We were flying into Honolulu and then on to Kona the next day and I didn't make these flight reservations until about a month later. After booking the flights the Hawaiian Airlines website asked if I would like to book a room. Well I looked it up, and the exact same room (with an $100 nightly resort credit) was available for around 20 - 25% less, including airfare. I thought this was great so I went and cancelled through Four Seasons and rebooked through Hawaiian Airlines. What a smart shopper I am! When we arrived at the Four Seasons and were taken to our room, it was downstairs and pretty close to the ocean, but the foliage was so overgrown that we could barely see the water. The gentleman checking me in was named Will and he ended up giving us a suite (for a small additional fee). He was great and they even cut all the foliage around that room the next day.

King’s Pond was a special treat for us; being less adventurous snorkelers, the 4000 fish within the safety of the pond allowed us to enjoy while being relaxed.

695076026,50,This is written by a 12 year old.,"No doubt, I would give this resort a five star rating. There are so many fun things to do for kids and adults. In this review, I will tell you about some of the aspects of the resort.    Restaurants: Our family went to four restaurants in all. We, first, went to Beach Tree. The lunch menu looks amazing and I would recommend it for lunch, but the menu was a little limited for dinner. We didn't enjoy that dinner as much as the others. We loved the Ulu restaurant. The sushi is amazing, and the desserts are also very good. The Hualalai Grille was my favorite restaurant. The steak was amazing and so was the fish. Our family liked to watch the golfers on the course. Some people are very good at golf, others need some work:). The last restaurant is the most underrated place on the resort. It is called The Residents. The food is amazing. The view is amazing. The dessert is the best I have ever had. The restaurants are SO good.    Pool and Ocean: Our family spent the most time at the quiet pool. I enjoyed reading on the edge of the pool. I recommend going snorkeling in the ocean just right in front of the resort. We saw three turtles, hundreds of little fish on the surface of the water, and some rainbow fish. You can also use King's Pond to snorkel. There is a spotted eagle ray in there. On week days, you can sign up to feed it.    All in all, this resort is great for kids and adults.

691517436,50,Incredible Place,"We’ve been coming to the Big Island for a long time, my wife is from there originally. We’ve stayed at every hotel on the Kohala coast. The Four Seasons Hualalai is easily the best hotel on the island, and has to be one of the best in the world.    One reason it’s so great is there is plenty of everything. At other beach hotels like this I always feel the need to rush to get a great spot at the beach, or by the pool, or to get a great table at a restaurant. This isn’t so here... I can totally relax knowing that whenever I show up there will be a great spot for us. I’m not sure what the occupancy was, there were certainly lots of people there, but every time we left our room we it was a total pleasure to use the amenities.    The staff was also awesome. Everybody was incredibly personable, they’re obviously encouraged to get to know the guests and I really like that. My wife knew on of the employees from school and he raved about what a great place it is to work and how he couldn’t imaging working anywhere else. I have in-laws that have worked at other hotels on the island, and they definitely don’t feel that way!

691204966,40,Sliding,"My family and I have been going to Hualalai every year for many years and it is slipping.    Either mgmt is going to step up and take care to keep the good staff, and pay a lot more attention to the details that differentiate a luxury property from others - or this is the new Mauna Lani or Mauna Kea - great in its day but those days were in the distant past.    The prices are ridiculous and that is fine - but the service quality and attention to detail must improve. I think it is all on the mgmt.    From silly pool policies with seating and holds to dirty bathrooms - to understaffed pools - none of this is hard. But instead of cranking up prices again - how about make some needed improvements?    The new pool deck is great. The new general store is great and well-run    The restaurants are tired. The menus are tired. The Beach Tree menu is stale. The grille. Ulu. No fresh local nor organic anything. Name one healthy option in property?    $48 for Ulu breakfast?  Clean the Seashell pool bathrooms every 2 hours? The Beach Tree every 3? Hire a second bartender so drinks comes out quicker.    There are great people on property - Robyn at kids club, Ashley in the poolside stand, even Darren the food runner. Michelle in the store. Nice people. Familiar faces. They make the experience better. Keep them. Turnover hurts. Familiar faces bring people back.    The grounds are always great. So you are starting on third base. Stop screwing up the simple stuff.    The resort was pretty empty this early July. And if the prices stay high and the service quality keeps sliding it will be down from here and frankly I do not mind 60-70%  occupancy as it’s quieter and more dinner avails:)",Jul 2019,July 2019,Traveled with family,,"Newport Beach, California"

690513800,50,A very special place,"My family of 4- 2 adults, 2 kids aged 6.5 and 9 just returned from our first stay at the FS Hualalai. This place is very special and we had a wonderful time. We had a 1st floor room on the lawn in front of the seashell pool. This was a great central location with easy access to the family (seashell) pool. There was never a problem with noise. The whole family enjoyed the outdoor lava rock shower. We rarely left the resort as we enjoyed our time so much. Daughters loved King's Pond so much they spent 6 hours there our first day- including touch tank, fish feeding, ray feeding, and swimming, snorkeling and playing in the ""aquarium"". One of the attendants fondly referred to them as fish.  The service was excellent overall. There was never a problem finding a place at the beach or pool and the attendants are very attentive in setting up your space with towels, menus, etc. The food and drinks at the pool come out very quickly. All the restaurant servers and staff are very polite, friendly, and attentive too. Beach Tree was our favorite- you can't beat the view and the ambiance, especially the live music in the evening as the sun is setting.  Swimming in the ""ocean pool"" is also amazing. We swam alongside sea turtles there more than once.  Our girls went to the kids club 3 times. Twice during regular business hours and once for a special event (Hawaiian Slime Night, 6-9PM, $100/each).    The ocean activities- Alakai Nalu are wonderful. You can book through the Four Seasons. We did a morning ribcraft snorkel trip. We were the only people on the trip so it was like a private tour. Kane and Casey took us out in search of dolphins, snorkel spots, and black sand beaches. We saw 100s of dolphins from within the boat, but amazingly, we were able to swim within the pod 3 different times. Magical!    The only critiques I have are:  - communicating w/ the concierge. We were in touch with the concierge by email starting months ahead of our trip. We had questions about the various restaurants, activities, etc and wanted to plan the perfect vacation. The concierge was not timely in responding, and several times we didn't get a response until we sent a follow up inquiry.  - additionally, upon arriving and checking in, we were told that the spa treatments we booked were not available as booked because the spa was undergoing repairs. We were never told this ahead of time. Instead of getting the couples massage in an outdoor hale followed by a hinoki bath, we had our massage in a popup spa assembled in unused guest rooms. No one ever communicated this to us in advance. Furthermore, we were led to believe the spa facilities (sauna, etc) were unavailable, but it turns out they were. We did not get the full spa experience, and probably would've made different plans if it were clearly communicated to us.    Overall, we had an amazing few days. Nightly rate and food/drink prices are quite high, the same as, or more so, than other luxe resorts we've been to that I'd probably return to again before returning to the FS Hualalai",Jul 2019,July 2019,Traveled with family,,"Los Angeles, California"
690438659,30,Overpriced. Good restaurant.,"Restaurant was good both for breakfast and dinner  Rest of the hotel was not worth the price. Rooms are small, older and the view is just OK. (We had an ocean view room that actually overlooked a dirty snorkeling pond with the ocean off in the distance).  Beach is clean but largely unswimmable, rocky etc - we did not see anyone swimming so we did not try either.    Overall underwhelming for the price paid (although probably true of other high end Big Island hotels too - seems to be a Hawaii thing - prices are out of touch with quality, possibly because of the “allure” of Hawaii - but Hawaii doesn’t compare in the least to other islands like the Maldives or Bora Bora, on which resort prices are quite similar).",Jul 2019,October 2018,,,"Paradise Valley, Arizona"
689922381,50,wonderful stay (with a few bumps),"The last leg of our summer vacation to Hawaii with my husband and 4-year-old was to the Four Seasons Hualalai. My expectations were really high, considering the reviews I've seen here, and elsewhere as well.    Starting at the airport, a sweet woman helped us with our luggage and getting to our taxi. Once we got to the hotel, we had a nice man to help check in, and tell us all about the hotel. Our room wasn't ready (we arrived a little after 1pm, and we were told the room would be ready by 3pm, guaranteed). We went over to the Residents' Beach House for lunch. Lunch was great. We finished up, and headed back to the lobby. The room was still not ready, but it was by about 3:15.    The room was gorgeous - we had an Ocean View room, with a lava rock shower. Super spacious, even with the cot for our daughter. We loved the shower and used it daily. So peaceful, and different. Our room was right by Kings Pond, so another gorgeous view. There were only a few issues with the room that I found. The AC wasn't great - it never got cold enough for me. Additionally, the window shades didn't block out enough sunlight in the AM (I wish there were blackout curtains). Finally, our location proved a little loud in the mornings with food carts, housekeeping, golf carts going back and forth...it was a little startling and the first morning i thought something literally crashed into our room.Housekeeping was good, turndown a little sporadic even though I called to tell them what time was best for us.    We ate at every restaurant on the property. Our favorite was the Beach Tree, and I wish we could order the corn agnolotti right now. :) The 4th of July BBQ was fantastic. Ulu breakfast was quite good. Ulu (dinner) and Hualalai Grill were fine - nothing to write home about, and the prices were absolutely not worth the quality we had. Residents' Beach Club - we had a nice lunch, but dinner came and there were 2 issues. 1 - a bird pooped in my husband's drink and 2 - there was a piece of hard plastic in our appetizer which ended up in my mouth. The bird poop was absolutely not the restaurant's fault, obviously. The waiter gave my husband a new drink after he brought it to their attention. The plastic - not the same experience. I brought it up with the waiter and when he was apologetic, I was like ""it's not a huge deal it happens, and we ate around it."" That being said, nothing was taken off the bill. Frankly, I was really surprised - I didn't bring it up that night at the restaurant because I was so surprised, but did at the front desk upon checkout. The woman I spoke with there was nice, and apologetic and offered to take it off the bill. I declined because at that point it didn't really matter, since it had happened several nights before and it was more that I just wanted them to know that this had been our experience. To sum up - I expected WAY more than we got food wise (and service wise) at the Four Seasons. There are not any restaurants nearby the hotel, you are kind of stuck with what they have unless you are willing to drive 15-20 minutes. Regarding the plastic issue - again, just surprised. It's a Four Seasons, and I expected better in terms of resolution.    The pools are lovely - especially Kings Pond! I wish there was a 2nd pool for kids. The Seashell Pool was packed (4th of July weekend) and it just got to be a lot. Considering the size of the property, I'm surprised that the pool isn't larger. The ""quiet pool"" allows kids, but they aren't allowed to splash or make any noise, so it's not a great fit. I LOVE quiet pools and miss them now that I am a mom, but in the summer with kids, two pools (or one larger) would be better for sure! Pool service was great, though and we appreciated the snacks, etc. that were brought around.    All in all, it was a great stay. I think we'll probably wait until our daughter is a little older to come back to Big Island, as there are so many awesome excursions to do there that will be much easier when she is older. The little criticisms I have are mainly there because of the high price we paid to stay, and the quality we saw as slightly missing during this trip for a few things. I still rated it 5 stars because it really is, even with the small misses. If you come here, you will have a marvelous time. :)",Jul 2019,July 2019,Traveled with family,,"New York City, New York"

685867706,50,Fantastic Honeymoon,"My wife and I celebrate our honeymoon at the Four Season Hualalai in June 2019. The service at this property exceeded all our expectations. Upon check in we were greeted by the receptionist who spent about 10 minutes reviewing the property, accommodations, and itinerary. We were upgraded to a sea view room that overlooked King's Pond. The room was beautifully decorated and bed was so soft and comfortable.    Thankfully we purchased the bed and breakfast package which provided us a $95 credit at Ulu. The breakfast was so filling that we usually opted for a light lunch. The views at breakfast were amazing. We sat watching the sun rise and dolphins out in the distance.    The pool and beach service was very good. The staff setup our beach chairs and filled up our water every hour or so. The drinks and bartender created some delicious drinks. They aren't cheap... but totally worth it.    We dined at the Beach Bar and Beach Tree for dinner. Both were good and the service was outstanding.    For activities we booked the Ribcraft and Volcano Tour. The Ribcraft was our favorite because we were able to swim with wild spinner dolphins for about 1 hour. It was a once in a lifetime opportunity. The Friends of Hawaii Volcano Tour was not worth it. It was basically a glorified shuttle. Lots of driving and not much to see.

They no longer put throw pillows on the beds so everything feels clean. Their response time on room service and on any requests is so exceptionally fast.

682951665,50,Our best resort stay to date,"Over all, this was the best resort stay we've experienced and the best of the 5 Four Seasons properties we've ever stayed at. The entire resort is distributed across the beachfront and all rooms have some kind of ocean view. It's much different from the Maui property, for example, where the resort is structured more like a traditional hotel. It makes for a very special atmosphere.    We stayed in an Oceanfront room, which I highly recommend. On the second floor, we were so close to the water that it's almost all you could see looking out of any of the windows. The soothing sound of crashing waves at night was wonderful.    The staff was excellent in virtually all aspects, and always addressed us by our last name. If I had one criticism about the property, it would be that pool and beach service is a bit less attentive than other resorts I have stayed at.    The food was excellent (we ate at every restaurant throughout the trip, and had breakfast every morning at Ulu). Lebron James and Chris Paul were staying at the resort and we saw them for breakfast Wednesday through Saturday of our stay. Our favorite, go to restaurant ended up being the most casual - BeachTree. The menu was perfect for us; largely locally sourced and many gluten free options. The fresh catch was reliably perfect. The prices are steep, but the quality was excellent and I never felt ripped off.    We had two couples' massages, which were both excellent. I also used the spa facilities almost every day, which is included in the price of the stay. The Ocean Pool is also amazing. There are a couple sea turtles and lots of tropical fish in this area, and you don't have to worry about currents or surf. We spent hours out there most days.    Some people complain that the resort needs a major update, but I don't agree. There are some bad looking roofs on property that FS appears to be in the process of replacing, but it didn't bother us at all. The resort is kept in immaculate condition other than that bit of maintenance, and we never experienced any unwanted noise.    Ultimately, we could have purchased a decent quality brand new car for what we spent on a 9 day trip all-in, but we did feel that we got what we paid for. This is a very special place.

681693560,30,Not up to par so far,"Writing after my first night at the Hualalai and I would have to agree with the person who said this FS is not at the same standard as the others.    Having stayed at many other FS just in the past couple of years (Wyoming, Vietnam, LA, Chicago, Tokyo), I agree the Hualai is wonderfully designed to take advantage of its locals with gorgeous pools and landscaping.    The trouble began when we checked in. We use our Amex Platinum which comes with amenities such as free upgrade. Instead we were offered “an upgrade” at an addicting $300/night. When we inquired about the commentary upgrade she said that was not available but reiterated this “offer.” It left a bad taste in our mouth as it seemed to be nickel-and-diming, and also refusing an room upgrade that was part of the Amex card rate (already at $2500/night!)    At the pool, I waited 15 min for towel set up then had to approach the staff twice before someone came to help. Then the aircon didn’t work and we had to spend 45 min with the room tech while trying to shower and get ready for dinner. Finally at dinner we were led to a back table while ocean-front tables sat empty.    Hopefully the second day will be better but I am not impressed so far. The spirit of Aloha seems to be missing from the Hualalai.",Jun 2019,June 2019,,,san francisco

There is a wonderful lap pool between the fitness buildings and the spa complex, very quiet and relaxing and has wifi! Having a lap pool outdoors was so great!! The fitness class offerings were plentiful yoga, pilates reformer classes, spinning,etc. Call ahead and have the concierge send you a weekly schedule so you bring what you need. My husband loved the Peleton bikes!!  The dining facilities are plentiful and every meal did NOT disappoint. Very healthy options.The staff was attentive to every need. Loved the welcome drink and lei I received upon arrival! I had never been to Hawaii and the hotel staff set me up with a driver who gave me an amazing 5 hour tour of the west side of the island with a stop for lunch-so great!!

681013912,10,Disappoints-do not recommend,"We have stayed in numerous FS with the family. This one disappoints in many areas. On arrival offered drinks for us and the kids without labels. Son ends up drinking the rum drink with detrimental consequence for the entire day. Management offers an apology stating we did not hear the description. Person is very soft spoken, multiple kids, a lot going on, signing paperwork etc. Best to label.    Rooms ok. Not very clean. Missing foot stools in our lanai double rooms. Toilet clogged.  Pool service meh. Watermelon skewers taste like sunblock. No spritz service.  Beach not swimmable due to spiny sea urchins and rocks.    Birds loud early morning. Good to increase soundproofing.  Lobby ok. Not meant to hang out or relax, more used for check in.    Concierge unhelpful. Had to do a lot of research and find the best option. Lukewarm reception, lack enthusiasm.    Location-not much going on. Need to drive into town 30-40min.    Room service poor. Dishes stacked, tablecloth on the side, no arrangement done on our table. Left all for us to arrange. Service which we pay for is lacking.    Complimentary coffee in the lobby not offered daily.    For an isolated hotel, not much in the way of stores. A couple.

From the minute I arrived (only 15 minutes from Kona Airport) to departure, it was one incredible experience after the next. This is all about the experience and the staff there has worked very hard to make that happen. Whether for a group event or leisure travel, there are numerous options to fill your time in a meaningful and memorable way. The food at the various restaurants was exceptional, the golf on property was challenging and picturesque. The Spa has 22 treatment rooms and it is very relaxing. The various pools offer a different experience at each one which was fun to explore. 90% of the guest rooms and suites have Ocean Views and the beach access was right there. More than all of this is the staff. You know what to expect with Four Seasons culture and they more than delivered on that promise. They are easy to talk to, very attentive, and genuine. The aloha spirit is alive and well here. They are not shy about their F/B pricing but worth every nickel to get the full experience.

The bartender Grant is the best bartender in Hawaii. I recommend his Mai Tai, Mango Lava Flow (pina colada with mango purée), and Bloody Mary. He will make anything on or off the menu, though! This pool does get full (though not that many seats so it doesn’t feel crowded), so make sure to go before 10am to get a seat, otherwise you may not see a free space until late in the afternoon.

680519159,40,What I’ve Learned,"I’m giving this place a 4/5 and not a 3/5 because I do think it’s a unique resort. My husband and I initially checked-in to the Hilton but left that same night (separate review on that ). We live on Oahu and wanted to spend the weekend on Hawaii Island to go to Green Sand Beach and Mauna Kea. We really weren’t in the room much. It’s a beautiful campus. And, yes, it’s expensive.    For me, I really only care about three things (four if it is for work) when staying in a hotel: comfortable bed, great food, updated decor (a gym is the fourth in case you were wondering). I’m taking off one point for this place because the room service was not good...at all. My Opah was over cooked and I had to request another, which was also over cooked. The cheese dish was the most edible but required no culinary skills. The bed was comfortable for me but too soft for the hubby. And, the decor seems outdated and old, with some chipping and wear.    We did see a freshwater pond with fish and Eagle rays that you can apparently wade with. I guess this is a cool feature.    Overall, beautiful grounds.    What I’ve learned from my experiences with resorts on the islands: the food is not that good and i’m planning to try to go more local on my next trip.",Jun 2019,June 2019,Traveled as a couple,,"Honolulu, Hawaii"

679324063,10,Disappointing for a Four Seasons Resort,"We have stayed at a number of nice resorts, Ritz Carltons, Waldorf astoria's, J.W. Marriots ect. This was my first stay at a Four Seasons and in my experience they didn't even come close to the service provided by the other resorts. Keep in mind this review is relative to a 5-start hotel, so of course, grounds, rooms and food were excellent and the wedding department there was incredible, however, service by the pool was terrible. To have slow service is one thing...to be completely and obviously ignored is another. Multiple times we had to chase down somebody for service, even a cup of water was difficult to get. Multiple times our orders were messed up, the bills for the pool-side service were NEVER correct. When we finally did get food, which was always missing something we had to wait another 15 minutes for them to bring out the ketchup, mustard etc. Maybe I am just being picky but when you are paying almost $1000 a night you really expect things to be at least as good as other resorts you have stayed at. I have never actually felt unwelcome at a resort like that before. Hope others have a better experience than we did.",Jun 2019,June 2019,Traveled with family,,

We were NOT disappointed! This place wowed us from the moment we pulled in! It is absolutely perfect in every way possibly imaginable! Stunningly beautiful, immaculately clean, and with the best customer service I have ever witnessed! (I am convinced that the words ""no"" and ""can't"" are banned from the staff vocabulary!) From the moment we checked in, when we were greeted with rum cocktails, fresh pineapple, and wet towels to freshen up with, to the sad moment when we checked out, we were continually impressed. The rooms were beautiful, the landscaping was beautiful, the scenery was beautiful, the pools were incredible, the spa and fitness center were incredible, the bars and restaurants were incredible! Everything about this place was impressive, but what impressed us the most was the management and staff! Professional, helpful, courteous, congenial, they are what elevate this resort to elite status!

It was huge! Full size living room/dining area, foyer & best of all 2 full bathrooms! The bedroom was large also. Huge lanai spanning the entire unit so both the living room & the bedroom had access to the lanai. We faced the adult pool, which means you had to be 21 to use it & it had a swim up bar. Aside from all this splendor, I cannot rave enough about the restaurants at this resort, every single meal was memorable. Our favorite was the Ulu Ocean Grill but all of them were fantastic. With the exception of the Hualalai Grill at the golf course, every restaurant was right on the beach so you always had great views of the sunsets. We frequented the quiet pool most days, great service & the cabanas are no extra charge. One note I will add is that there are a lot of stairs on this property & you do quite a bit of walking to get around, but the staff is happy to take you anywhere in a golf cart. We also really enjoyed playing the golf course, it was fun & beautiful with all the lava...it was also empty when we were there, not typical for golf in Hawaii. I just can't say enough good!!

672374094,50,Simply the best resort on the Big Island,"There have been many great reviews about the Four Seasons, and it is truly that great. The one thing I was going to add is that many of the villas and even houses along the golf courses are available for rent on various websites, and if you travel there as a family with children that may be the way to go. You can still use the hotel's amenities (there are some restrictions during the peak holiday times) but you have a whole house to yourself which means you can have the same experience as the home owner who is too busy to enjoy the place himself. Each villa or house comes with electric golf carts so you don't have to use your car within the resort. But don't forget to venture outside of the resort as well to see the rest of the island, it is all too easy to just arrive at the Hualalai resort and not go anywhere.",May 2019,April 2019,,,"San Francisco, CA"

670930826,50,Magical and Spiritual,"This place is something very special. Very deep. The grounds are awesome, well manicured.  Beach - The whole place is created by black lava. A little different from your standard beach, but not spoiled by the man made beach concept. Snorkeling was very good tight at the resort beach area. There were turtles jumping fish and a great variety of every other type of fish.    Accommodations - these are bungalow style accommodation, not your typical high rise resort. It was a refreshing change of pace. At first it took a minute to get used to because we were used to the big hotel towers at most Four Seasons Resorts, but after the first day or two it grows on you. Ironically, when I recently visited Four Seasons at Ko Olina, I was missing the intimacy of the bungalow style rooms at Huallalai    The Island - truly unbelievable. It was not commercialized. This place is truly sacred ground. The island was unspoiled by man. Ocean was blue, blue, blue. We swam with dolphins in the ocean and it was life changing. The company was Hawaiian oceanic. It was awesome. Not into the dolphins in captivity. I assure you none of the dolphins we swam with in the ocean had bent dorsal fins. We also did a helicopter ride with Blue Hawaiian located a short distance from the resort. Also, a life changing experience. I would highly recommend both excursions.  Service - was Four Seasons standards. Before we arrived, the concierge set up dining options by rotating all the restaurants. The Beach House was probably the best of them. Make no mistake, it aint cheap. Dining options somewhat limited because resort is somewhat secluded.    Spa - Magical. Best steam room ever. Also, they offer a plethora of products to use post-spa. Moisturizers and top quality product. The services were great as well. We did a couples Lomi-Lomi massage and then relaxed in the waterfall area. Best experience.  Golf was very cool as well, Course cut in black lava rocks. 'Nuff said.  This place is a winner winner chicken dinner.

669509415,10,Avoid staying at the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai,"The Four Seasons in Kona is such a let down compared to our previous stay to that at the Four Seasons in Vietnam. Gosh where do we start?  *we had one of the premium rooms which is right outside Kings Pond overlooking the ocean beyond. The room offers very little privacy. And let's just say, when we were having adult fun in bed, we noticed one couple staring/watching us and they were standing on the pathway around Kings Pond. Of course they walked away when we glared at them, but there is no privacy; if you are doing that, you must close your shades, you cannot keep them open to see the ocean. Four seasons should grow some more shrubs or have thought about lowering the pathway around the pond so guests have privacy  *the rooms are VERY dated and showing their 22 years of age  *we had very poor experiences at their ULU restaurant, which seems to be highly overrated. Of our comment regarding ULU sushi grill which is on the Four Seasons Kona property: it’s mediocre. The toro is great, and that's really it. The servers are generous with their sake pours which is terrific as well, and that's really the only other positive about the restaurant. We had generous saki tasting pours with our waitress Regina and also another waitress Alicia since we ate here for two nights. The negatives: the rice in all of our dishes had too much rice wine vinegar or something and the rice texture was not ideal so the nigiri is ruined and the rice bowls are not good. Regarding terrible service: on one of our dinners where Crisha and Courtney were working, both ladies failed to give us seats to the restaurant as resort guests and only comped us an appetizer and dessert AFTER we complained. After the front desk senior staff had to speak to these two ladies to help us get a dinner seat, and only after mentioning we knew the senior executives at Four Seasons, is when both Crisha and Courtney apologized. The problem is, what are they actually sorry for?? Think about it: what did they do wrong. Apparently they should not have done anything wrong if they were turning us away due to a full reservation that night (by the way, there were empty tables and once we got seated after all the issues were settled, there still never was a full house at the restaurant at any given point that night). It was only after we complained to front desk and that Crisha and Courtney said a table just happened to become available: if that was the whole truth, what are they sorry for? Are they only apologizing because we know Senior executives at the Four Seasons and they realize how rudely (especially Crisha) they treated us. It is unacceptable at this level to treated like that at a resort restaurant especially for the premium room guest as we were staying at the Four Seasons. Resort guests should always have seating for their resort guests because there are no other restaurants nearby: guests should always have preferential treatment when it comes to seating compared to out-of-Resort guests  *The breakfast is terrible for $45 USD a person. Also during breakfast the restaurant does this weird cheap ""Costco"" like thing where a man is promoting Kona Coffee and offering coffee tasting outside ULU restaurant. The whole approach is coming across very cheasy and at a place like Four Seasons it is pretty embarassing  *For the outdoor beach service by the Kings Pond: Craig the waitor was not good, but Johnny was great.  *if you're looking for a quiet resort, this is not it. There are a a ton of guests and non-resort guests on the property  *the only thing I liked about the hotel that stood out was their 24/7 text messaging service. They always responded super quickly. That would be great if more hotels offered this service  *worst off: my boyfriend was sent a comment link email after our stay. He filled it out with some of our main concerns/feedback and mentioned Four Seasons could contact us. The hotel never bothered to reach us to rectify any of this.

It is sometimes embarrassing how much they want to do for you to enjoy your vacation and how nice they are doing it. We are already planning our next trip here with our entire family.

Lots of activities and big pools (swim with 4,000 fish and rays in King's Pond; have fun with kids in family pool; relax around adults-only quiet Beach Tree pool, with no lap swimming or diving). Excellent food, beverage and towel service around the pools. Restaurant service not five star. Disengaged at times at dinner. Better at breakfast. One annoying routine: fast bussing of tables, to turn the tables in Beach Tree and Ulu. Kind of pushy about clearing plates, even when not done. Menus fairly basic. Best menu was at the resident's beach club (need to have concierge make reservation since residents have first choice). More classic entrees at the grille, overlooking the 18th green. Enjoyed great pork chop, and filet, and rice with lobster and bacon. Good idea to rent a car and get off property. Get a feeling for the island and the beauty of nature, including where lava from volcano eruptions changed the landscape and the beaches. The golf course weaves through some lava fields, a private home section and along the beach and can be fun for players of all abilities. Excellent spa and gym, with many spinning, yoga and other classes. The rooms have been updated in some sections of the resort.

The restaurants are all fantastic and staffed with superb servers. The rooms themselves while a little dated in style, are very clean, and have everything you will need. A few important notes:    * The concierge service before and during our stay was the best we've ever experienced. Download the Four Seasons app. Its worth it. You can chat the to concierge from your beach chair.    * We greatly appreciated the large balcony. It was perfect for breakfasts in the morning and glass of wine at night. It appears that all rooms are equipped with the same large balconies or patios.    * Each block of rooms has access to a washer and dryer with detergent pods so that you can do laundry. Without going through the hotel service. This is a tremendously valuable amenity for all guests but especially families on longer trips.    * Guest rooms are in two story blocks wrapped around one of the four pool areas. Each pool area has its own personality (Kings Pond is secluded. Seashell is active and family oriented. Beach Tree is a nice mix. Palm Grove is adult oriented) but it must be said that there really are no bad room locations.    Yes it's very expensive. However, in this case you do get what you pay for. Great for a romantic get away or an amazing spot for a family vacation. Few resorts are perfect for both but Hualalai nails it.",Apr 2019,April 2019,,,"Ottawa, Canada"

667055065,20,Disappointing Experience,"We were so looking forward to the Four Seasons experience, but the visit fell short. The reasons for our disappointing experience were primarily customer service related.    Overall, we felt the wait times for food and beverages were really long. This both goes for the wait to get the food and the wait to get into the restaurants at dinnertime.    On our first night, we almost struck out entirely at dinner! We first went to the sushi restaurant where we were told there was a 2.5 hour wait. Over 1/2 of the tables were empty, but staff said that bad weather was moving in and they couldn't open up those tables. Regardless, I left them with my phone number to call when the table was ready. No call ever came. Then, we tried to get into the Beach Tree restaurant where we were told there would be a 35 minute wait (regardless of about 1/2 of the tables being empty). The hostess suggested that we just eat at the lounge since the full menu was available there. With a small kid, we felt that we needed to sit down for our meal, so we told the hostess that we would wait in the lounge until our table was ready. We let her know that our plan was to get a drink and an app in the lounge while we wait. At the lounge in the entire 30 minutes, not one person stopped to give us menus, ask for a drink order, bring water, or anything at all. Tables were about 30% occupied which left me wondering why the service was so strained? There was a server going to the tables, but why she kept skipping us, I do not know. When I tried to get her attention, she just said, ""I'm really swamped, I'll need to get my manager for you"" and walked off. Finally, I went back over to the beach tree hostess and inquired if we could have one of the 10-ish empty tables at the Beach Tree. She scolded me! She said, ""Ma'am, you still have 8 minutes to wait until you can have a table"". I am unsure how table occupancy would have changed in that 8 minutes. We went back to our lounge table (still without service) and waited until the Beach Tree hostess decided it was ok for us to eat. I was shocked by how rudely we were treated by the hostess and shocked by the complete lack of service at the lounge.    The next day we had a lovely breakfast experience, but the poor customer service picked back up again at the quiet pool. I had put my daughter down for a nap was was relishing in the hour or so of alone time I would get in peace! I asked for a drink and 30 minutes later had to check back up on the drink. I was told that drink order was never put in, but no offer to expedite a new order or anything. So I re-put my drink order in and still waited almost another 15 minutes. By that time the baby woke up and my pool time with my lava flow was over.    Lastly, we were contacted after we left about items that we allegedly hadn't paid for at check out only to receive a folio for gift shop items that we had never purchased. The resort is refunding, but it was still a little shocking for a high end resort to mix up charges like that.    Overall, the wait times for food and beverage was slow and the service abrasive. I almost felt like they acted like we shouldn't be there! There were a few bright spots - The rooms are phenomenal, Melissa at the front desk was lovely and the spa was gorgeous!    I love the grounds, the accommodations, and the facilities, but don't know that any of that is worth being treated so poorly by staff - especially in this price point.",Apr 2019,April 2019,Traveled with family,,"Brooklyn, New York"

665589676,50,Excellent Spring Break Family Vacay,"We had a great time at the FS Hualalai over spring break. The hotel was at capacity during our stay, but the hotel has a very high staff to guest ratio, so it was not an issue for us. There were many poolside attendants available and we were always able to get lounge chairs with umbrellas at the pool, no matter the time of day. I appreciate that we didn't feel stressed to have to wake up early to run down and reserve a chair for the day and also that all pool attendants, not just restaurant servers, are able to take your order for drinks and food. We had excellent dinners at both the Hualalai Grill and Beach Tree Restaurant and enjoyed the expansive buffet breakfast at 'Ulu. Our teen/tweenage kids enjoyed the games room when they weren't in the pool or exploring the beach path for errant golf balls...we ended up finding over 30 balls by the end of our stay!

The service at the pool was excellent and the on site restaurants were very good. Prices are as you’d expect for the FS but worth every penny. Beaches are rocky and have some sandy spots for snorkeling but it’s isn’t the best. There is a fully stocked ‘pond’ for on site snorkeling adventures, kids would love this feature.

You are greeted personally at check in with a lei and mai tai in a lobby that looks out over the ocean. If you want to be pampered to the highest end this is where to stay. Every request can be met by the staff. We had room service everyday which was spot on time as requested and delish! There are numerous activities the concierge can help as well as in site activities. The property is very large and they also will give you a ride to your destination on their property is. Restaurants.  The Beach Tree was a beautiful outdoor dining spot, and the food was 4 stars. The Ulu bar was a little snotty however that is to be expected at a 4 Seasons, trust me if you want snotty try the San Francisco location. It’s not as bad but expect to be paying close to $20 a drink at this bar or $125 for a 25 year single malt MacCalllans scotch.  You will feel like royalty but it comes with the price tag. If you can afford it then stroll on!  Rooms were very quiet but we stayed during the “slow” time before spring break. I definitely recommend sone type of ocean view room and an upstairs one so you don’t hear people above you. There is a lagoon stocked with 4000 fish for a safe snorkeling experience and they even have a eagle ray you can feed with the trainers.

657676980,50,Perhaps the Pinnacle?,"Okay, I have read a few less-than-stellar reviews of this place, and that is what these things are about; variety of opinion. However, allow me to weigh in. We spent 4 days here on a brief sojourn from Oahu to the big island, and the last days here were perfect. That is a high standard, but they were indeed perfect. Now, do not get me wrong. This isn't a bargain, or a great deal for the money, or anything like that. You're staying at a Four Seasons, and it is going to cost a few dollars. However, everything should be worth it, and make you appreciate that the money is spent for a reason, and that is indeed what we experienced. Our reception - perfect. A cool drink while the staff got things for us to sign and got a driver and a cart to get us to our room. Meals - we ate largely on property. Not cheap, and not ordinary. Unbelievable. Meals at poolside (and we spent lots of time. at the pools) were very, very good. Drinks poolside the same. Our room was spacious, well appointed, looking over the lagoon with various sea life within it and on to the beach, and quiet and just amazing. We went for runs on property; well directed and always with a cool water to greet us on return. The beach is more rocky than expected, but there are plenty of ways to get into the surf and enjoy it. The infinity pool was a high point. We could still be there and be very happy. Bars and restaurants were all very, very well done. We enjoyed drinks at the beachside bars watching the sun set (another reason to be there.). Go.

656853588,30,I thought I was staying at the Two Seasons!,"I don't write many reviews and normally just leave it to my wife who I think has 6-700 or so but this experience was so disappointing I couldn't let it go by with nothing said. We started the day with a private tour of their oyster farm w Kelsey and a tasting with champagne and oysters at the Residents Beach House (open to the public and much more private) which was amazing. Eric at the Residence Beach House was extremely knowledgeable and professional so I'm thinking all is well. We had checked in early and our room was not available but I received notification during Lunch that the room had become available so after we finished we got our key cards from the front desk and proceeded to our room 2102 (building 21 second floor). We were informed we were given a room upgrade from an ocean view room. The room had a nice view of the ocean but was dated and I would be hard pressed to notice the upgrade. I think the only additions that have been made to this room were a big screen TV (65"") and possibly a small couch w nice pillows since 1996 when the hotel was built. The weather has been fantastic so we decided to sit outside on the lanai but we were greeted with the smell of BBQ/fried foods from the BeachTree restaurant directly in front and asked for a room change. We were once again told this was a room upgrade from 2102 to room 802. This was a bottom floor unit in building 8 with closer proximity to the ocean. I can truly say the only upgrade this room has seen since 1996 is a 65"" TV. The room felt spartan lacking any real decor. Not sure but I was confused by 20+ year old furniture and three chairs in the bedroom. This room since it is on the lower floor has a cabana for two as well as two teak chairs and a table outside. Not sure why the unit needed another two chairs and a small (dining) table inside instead of a couch and ottoman like 2102.  House keeping also missed the turndown after I specifically asked directly for it which I thought was odd after returning from a $400.- dinner. I called and they said they could send one and I declined since I didn't want to be bothered this late in the evening and just asked for a call from management who was very nice and resolved the issue in the morning. While the private cabanas are nice just outside our unit I think they would be much more inviting if housekeeping place terry cloth covers on daily.  In closing this hotel is in desperate need of a major renovation and has been riding way too long on its good reputation. With the Mauna Lani just up the road acquired from Auberge resorts and a $100+ million renovation in progress this hotel will need to up its game!

Also we noticed depending on the prevailing winds, some rooms have a distinct restaurant aroma.

We can't say enough about the service... at times it seemed the staff was telepathic. We traveled with two children (ages 7 and 10) and the hotel took really good care of the whole family. The layout of the hotel seemed to create different experiences for different guests with family-centric locations and activities that seamlessly interlaced with couples and adult groups.

My family and I stayed at a privately owned condo on site and we were able to access everything at the hotel. It was so much fun taking a golf cart down and up. It allowed us to see how gorgeous the property truly is. The best part of the entire experience was the pool side service. They came the perfect amount of times to check in on us, they would bring frozen fruit out for snacks when it got hot, they were constantly freshen your water, and they would even often to clean your sun glasses.

653786259,20,Beware of Bad Weather!,"We had the bad luck to be staying here for 2 days of heavy rain. Not their fault obviously- except that the hotel seemed surprisingly unprepared for this situation. It’s various services seemed to be quickly stressed, and the service level dropped. The Spa seemed maxed out by the extra demand, and appeared to have brought in the “B Team” staff to try to deal with things. My wife had a massage in a large room with some equipment in it which was obviously not a regular massage location. The crowded restaurants moved everything indoors and, as with the Spa, the ambiance was long gone.  All of this could have been okay, except for one thing: there was zero recognition of the obvious problems and the price points all stayed at the same very high level. Sorry, but when the water is literally coming under the door it is no longer a 5 Star experience and a good hotel will forget its profit margins for the moment and will take the initiative in addressing the obvious situation (some recognition and a complimentary dessert go a long way!). I am sure that they deserve their stellar reputation, but a test of any business is how it responds when things go wrong. They were tone deaf and seemed okay that people were spectacularly overpaying for what they were getting. Anyone booking there should especially hope for good weather!",Feb 2019,February 2019,,,"Edmonton, Canada"
653741351,50,Awesome as always! Possibly the best place to stay in Hawaii.,"The service at the property is top notch! And it is nice to see that they keep up the high standards as the time goes by.    The staff is helpful, professional and friendly. At the arrival they greet you with a drink/cocktail and cold towels, and while you relax and fresh up, they bring you a folder with check in documents. So the check in is pleasant and bearly noticeable. They upgraded me to an ocean-view room with a magnificent view. The property is very big and very well maintained. So even when hotel operates at full capacity, it still does NOT feel crowded. People just spread out. We have never been disappointed with food or drinks at any of the restaurants on the property or in-room dining.    The staff at the main pool could have been a little more attentive. But that definitely didn't affect my experience, as I was always able to get drinks/food/towels promptly.    We have stayed at Four Seasons Hualalai numerous times, and it has always been amazing.

It was incredible and we were completely satisfied with our trip. Gym, with rock climbing, basketball, lap pool and everything else you could want, including snacks.

We paid quite the premium to stay here during holiday season so was frankly disappointed. Loved the outdoor shower though. These rooms are nothing compared to Four Seasons Lanai. Also, not the most private.    Grounds - Loved that you are so close to the beach but honestly, the resort felt like it could be on a beach anywhere. I didn't get the super lush Hawaii feel I was expecting.  There was a gorgeous rocky area in the water to take the most lovely family photos.  Loved that there were so many pools and hot tubs to choose from. I especially love an adult pool and the protected ocean pool area. Did have trouble flagging people down from time to time bc the place was PACKED during xmas/NYE time.    Food - Fresh and delicious. Amazing breakfast buffet! Best in Hawaii. Loved watching the sunset from the deck at Beach Tree. Loved the more trendy upscale vibe at Ulu.    Spa/gym - Had the MOST AMAZING deep tissue massage! I had to will myself up and off the massage table, I had turned into jello. Best spa amenities of all the spas we visited on our xmas/NYE trip in Hawaii.

The food is fantastic with my favorite being the grilled lobsters and ahi tuna.The hotel rooms are gorgeous with views of the ocean and pools or King's Pond which has over 70 species of sea life.

The general store on property has a nice place for coffee and a quick breakfast and ULU has an excellent buffet breakfast. Beautiful sunsets from any of the ocean front restaurants. Gym is well equipped. Bocce and tennis courts, this place has a lot to do. But the best happened after we left.

The facilities were beautiful. My tips for the room is the mildew in the shower needs to be address and there was mold in the sand candle on the outside table.  We had a few hiccups with the service, we asked the front desk if we could do somethings and later they disclosed the opposite in an awkward manner. When I addressed the situation with the front desk she just blew us off...""oh I'm sorry"", but I'm not really going to do anything for you or about it.

646841978,40,Fantastic Experience here ... AFTER the holiday,"The Hualalai property is absolutely gorgeous and there is a lot of beach front and poolside space which means you really get to enjoy the water while you're there. The food and drinks were fantastic … we almost never felt the need to search out other dining options while we were at the resort. It has excellent gym facilities, which is something that lots of resorts seem to skimp on, but is really important to me and my family.    We had a one-bedroom suite which was spacious, well decorated, and very comfortable. We especially appreciated the robe and stuff animal provided for our 5 year old son upon arrival. We had to move rooms during our stay (our fault, not Four Season's), and our first room had an outdoor shower while our second did not. The outdoor shower was nice ... make sure to ask for it if you're staying on a ground floor suite.    The concierge was extremely helpful in helping us to plan activites during our stay, and the valet and front desk were always on top of things and knew us by name. Service was top notch during our entire stay.    I really only have 3 issues / negatives with the stay, which are relatively minor. The first was that half of our stay was during the ""Festivus"" period. During that period it was extremely difficult to get dinner reservations and chairs at the pool and the beach. We timed our stay on the Big Island to coincide with some friends who have older kids in school. We honestly were not aware of how busy things get during the Winter Break period. Anyhow, while it made things a bit stressful, when I expressed my dissastisfaction multiple managers contacted me and did what they could to make the best of the situation. After the Festivus season ended, things really quieted down and we started having the vacation we had really imagined. If you have the option, I would not visit this resort during the Festivus season, although perhaps if you're expecting it, it would still be enjoyable. Second, we found ourselves wandering around the property quite a bit for a few days. Signage is not great and it was frustrating at times trying to make our way around. More directions more frequently with better lighting would be helpful. The third and last quibble is with the quality of food in the snack shop / store The Trading Company. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, but the food quality, choices and speed were not that great. We ate there when we had to (busy day planned or didn't want to sit down to a full meal), but never looked forward to the experience.    All in all, I would definitely stay at this resort again, and I bet if we had stayed outside of the Festivus period I would be giving this resort a 5-star rating. The food, people, view, and facilities were all top notch and made for a fantastic stay.",Jan 2019,January 2019,Traveled with family,,"Lisbon, Portugal"

638458509,40,"Nice resort, just not the FS we were expecting","Our family ventured to the FS Hualalai for the second half of our vacation and leaving with mixed feelings. We grew up coming to the Big Island amongst others and had high expectations from other hotels on island we had stayed at. Prior to our stay we also had several people exclaim to us “it was the best hotel ever, you have to go there” but all of us named at least a handful of experiences each we preferred just at Four Seasons properties alone let alone other destinations.    The hotel is set upon a majestic lava encumbered landscape that anyone would be hard pressed not to find beautiful and appreciative of their surroundings. That first impression quickly faded when we actually got to the property and had a bit of dishevel with the rooms and overall booking. The initial rooms we were taken to were beautiful but had the staunch odor of perfumed de-smoke agent to mask a prior occupants habit. The front desk was able to accommodate us in the same room type else where later in the day which worked out fine. Prior to that we had serious reservation issues which just started the trip off with a very poor taste in comparison to other stays at FS properties.    The staff per usual of FS quality is great and attentive to your requests. The pool staff holds true in this regard especially, Tanner, Sierra and everyone else was exceptional.    The restaurant choice is pretty verbose although a tad repetitive with food choices. We tried every place and you’ll notice a recurring semi shared dish scheme. Whatever you do, go to the Beach House for lunch and have the seafood enchiladas. They are freaking unreal. After lunch around 2 stroll down the beach past the 17th hole and try to scope out the napping turtles. Golf was beautiful and worthwhile course to enjoy.

638342302,50,Relaxing Paradise on the Big Island,"This resort has held its charm and modernity in the 20+ years its been open. It is quite pricey (be prepared to dole out big bucks for pretty much everything) but the service is outstanding and the food is impeccable. Unlike other large, Hawaiian resorts, this one maintains the intimacy and quietude of a smaller hotel.    We originally booked a golf-view room but was upgraded to an oceanfront room. While it was lovely to be able to walk right out on to the ocean, the golf view rooms are much more private. Many of the ground floor ocean front rooms have people walking right by that can easily look right in to your space. Furthermore, we were on sunset beach where every night they had live music which, although wasn't super loud or didn't go very late, was annoying. I'd much rather have my windows open listening to the waves at night rather than a cheap band.    As others have mentioned, many of the ground floor rooms have outdoor showers which are lovely and romantic. The second floor rooms don't have these but undoubtedly have better views so if you prefer one or the other, I'd make a request.    All three main restaurants are delicious but almost laughably expensive. The best is the sushi lounge. If you're trying to save a couple bucks, order lunch by the pool (equally tasty) but a bit less pricey.    If you're interested in swimming in the ocean, the resort has built a small sea wall along a portion of the beach to prevent the strong swells and rip currents the area is known for from affecting this section of the beach. This was a really nice treat since most areas of the the Big Island, it can be quite dangerous to just wander right into the water. The enclosed aquarium for snorkeling (and Eagle Ray feeding which is super fun) is also delightful (especially if you have children learning to snorkel for the first time).    Overall, we had a wonderful experience. However, I don't think we'll be coming back.

The rooms are starting to show their age and need some refreshing.  The restaurants...  •Ulu for breakfast. The food whether ala carte or the buffet is outstanding and the service is none better.  •Ulu for dinner.....it's been disappointing two years in a row. The service needs attention. It's as if there are two separate outfits running the restaurant at breakfast and dinner. Night and day.  •Beach Tree... the beach side location is out of this world and the service and food is exceptional.  •The Resudebrs Club....the best ahi sashimi we've ever had. And another exceptional beach side location.  The pools... there are several and can be a little overcrowded at times even in off-season times. Get there early. The poolside service is excellent.  And some little things that sometimes can make a difference and may be the result of management changes....  •No longer does the gatehouse nor the valet greet by saying ""welcome home"".  •And the many electric service carts do not stop when guests are in the paths.

633717108,40,"stunningly beautiful, friendly staff, a few glitches & OTT expensive","We considered coming here for a week but after reading quite a few negative reviews about service, decided to stay for one night when on the BI for a couple days to check it out first before committing to a week. The room we had was up to the Four Seasons standard except that the A/C was loud and rattled...all night. At $800/night not something you'd expect or wish to tolerate. The grounds, pools and seaside are stunning, truly one of the most beautiful resorts we've ever seen and we've been to resorts in Mauritius, continental Africa, Sardinia, Thailand, and the Middle East. One thing that did set this Four Seasons apart from other 4S is the genuine friendliness of the staff, especially the valet and pool staff and food servers. We had an amazing dinner at the Ulu Ocean Grill and our server Tic deserves a special mention because she just knows her stuff and was a pleasure to be served by. We split three appetizers, one order of uni, a snapper special for two people, one dessert and two cocktails each -- and dinner was $450. The food was outstanding but that's OTT even by Hawaiian standards. The next morning we returned to the grill for breakfast after specifying that we just wanted a coffee and pastry, not the full buffet breakfast, and were told we would be charged accordingly. Two coffees and pastries was $75. When we were seated, a server came and offered the ""juice of the day"". Neither me nor my husband drink juice but my husband wanted to taste it so asked for just a little. That taste $10 on the bill. Lunch by the pool is a bargain compared to dinner and breakfast, and it was very good, as were poolside cocktails We tried room service for two cocktails the night before while getting ready for dinner. My husband was told they were busy but would get the cocktails out quickly. 40 minutes later I called back to ask if we could cancel since we were now leaving for dinner and they quickly said yes. It probably would have been more than an hour wait for two cocktails and the hotel did not seem anywhere near full so I cannot imagine what service would be like during a busy week like Thanksgiving. Had my husband been told that it would be over 1/2 hr, he would have gone and got the cocktails himself or made do with something from the mini bar. Room service is better off being honest about wait times instead of taking an order they cannot fulfill in a reasonable time period. Would we go back? If money were no object, without a doubt but definitely not during a period when the hotel would be full or near full.",Nov 2018,November 2018,,,"London, United Kingdom"
633690463,40,Wonderful Staff/ Beautiful Grounds,"We booked Four Seasons for the pools (staying in an airbnb the first half of our trip to do siteseeing). The pools that were available certainly didn’t disappoint and the staff are very lovely. A couple of things that were a bit of a let down (and this is simply due to the price that Four Seasons demands): the main pool (the one in all the pictures) was closed so they could redo the deck. No mention of this prior to our stay, which is not very cool in my opinion. There should be discounts during a time when all of the services paid for are not available. This led to overflow at the adult pool. We heard several people talking about it, as well as staff mentioning that they wished guests had been notified ahead of time. Rooms near that pool got all the noise during the day, luckily we were not on that side. The rooms are dated but still very nice. We had a downstairs room that felt a bit dark and basement-like. I would try for an upstairs room. On a more positive note, the grounds are simply beautiful, breakfast is delish (get the lemon ricotta pancakes), the music on the lawn at night is lovely too. We used the workout room(s) and man, they have everything you could want and more. We checked out the rooms closer to the workout facilities (300 room #s) and I would not want to stay on that side. It’s near the public parking lot as well as the herb garden and fishery (they raise their own Moi) and it smells not so good (although good on them for having their own herb garden).... self parking is easy (and saves you an unnecessary 30+ dollars a day), you park in the same lot as the valet and you are right at the entrance. One other note... most of these hotels discourage outsiders from using the public beaches (with their gates), but you are able to drive up to the gate and let the guard know you are going to the beach and they will point you to the public lot.    Side note: Make sure and swing by Da Poke Shack south of the airport before you check in (we did that and never had better poke the rest of our stay).",Nov 2018,November 2018,Traveled as a couple,,"Portland, Oregon"

632471165,50,A beautiful oceanside resort with stellar Four Seasons service,"We booked a Prime room and were upgraded to a Deluxe location in bungalow 8, I think one of the best rooms in the resort, with a gorgeous view of the ocean, beach, and Kings Pond. Watching sunrise from our second floor lanai was a magical way to start the day. Thank you, Four Seasons!    Rooms are arranged in two-story ""bungalows"" in four crescents around the resort's four pools. Room categories are a little confusing on the website, best to call and discuss your preferences. I think most of the rooms are the same, but the categories indicate different locations. ""Prime"" rooms are on the second floor in any of the four clusters, ""Deluxe"" rooms are in Bungalow 8 facing King's Pond (and right next to Bungalow 9 on the end, which is an ""Oceanfront"" bungalow - these are the ones on the ends of each crescent, closest to the beach.) And within each cluster, I think the end rooms are preferable - the ones in the middle are kind of set back, with walls on either side of the lanai, whereas the end ones stick out further and have a more expansive, open view.    It was a huge comfortable room, with a walk-in closet, four big dresser drawers, and spacious, well-appointed bathroom. The large lanai had two comfortable padded chairs and ottomans, and a big table. The bed was super comfortable, with great functional bedside tables including charging stations on each side, much appreciated. It was furnished with two light cotton bathrobes, a beach bag, umbrella, and coffeemaker.    Amenities in the room included a package of shortbread cookies with a welcome note, and a little mousse cake for my husband's birthday. A few days later, we were surprised and delighted to find a plate of assorted sweets - chocolates and caramels. And the pool/beach service includes little treats throughout the day - fruit, m&ms, otter pops, aloe vera, etc - as well as a steady supply of ice water. One day, they came around offering to clean our sunglasses! At each pool, there's free sunscreen (both SPF 30 and 50) and leave-in hair conditioner, and different food menus. Service is outstanding throughout the resort, everyone is very friendly and we felt very pampered!    The beach is nice for relaxing, and since we were there at the end of October, it wasn't too busy and we never had a problem finding open lounges. This isn't the best beach on the island, much of it is fairly steep/narrow and there are a lot of rocks in the water. The best portion for going in the water was the stretch in front of the big Seashell pool, where there's a rocky breakwater just offshore so the surf is very mild and it's not too rocky. But if you have water shoes, I suggest bringing them    The restaurants are all good. There's extensive workout facilities, and a general store selling snacks, gift items, and some casual breakfast and lunch items, and even a gas station onsite (about 50 cents a gallon more expensive than elsewhere, but great if you just need to top off the rental car before returning it.) You will need a car to go anywhere, as there's nothing within walking distance of the resort.    What could be improved? I'd like a handheld in addition to the rain shower head. And they really need to buy a true shave ice machine for the surf shack! Especially for the price they charge, it's a shame that what they sell is really just a snow cone - and not even a good one, at that. We had real shave ice in town, and it was delicious.

The place is beautiful, the pool, oceanfront and golf course world class. We stayed in the golf/ocean view rooms. This is the most affordable option here. The view is perfect - it is a quiet area. But the rooms are dated and have issues. Hot water only comes in the shower, never could get it in the sink, originally we were told our ceiling fan speed was not adjustable but noticed in other rooms adjacent to ours the fans seemed to work fine so asked again and someone came and showed us how to adjust it. Housekeeping was inconsistent - some days they didn't come until later in the afternoon and we never knew if they would leave the right things we needed for coffee - meaning real sugar, coffee stirrers - simple things. However, they were the nicest people ever and very polite! I know they are planning to update the rooms we stayed in so maybe that will fix the issues.

The water was amazingly warm, clean and clear, the waves were controlled by the natural lava rock walls, and it made for the best snorkeling experience, we saw so many beautiful fish & sea turtles! which is saying a lot because snorkeling in King’s pond was out of this world amazing! The beachside/pool service, as well as each of the restaurant’s service, made us feel like we staying with friends from out of town, everyone took the time to actual have a conversation (which may have had something to do with my chatty hubs) The Spa is a must, pure nirvana.

I used my Amex Platinum concierge to book the stay which automatically affords you many bonus options including an upgraded room, if available. I was given a beautiful quiet room overlooking the Kings Pond and the ocean. They have five or more swimming pools or ponds including an adults only one. The food at Ulu Grill is very fine w entrees running 38-48 dollars for the most part... it’s sunset view is marvelous including from their bar. There are washer and drier amenities near each room section for your convenience. The Spa jacuzzi, sauna, steam room etc is availability for hotel guests at any time, no Spa service required. The athletic club is comprehensive and is superior to any Hotel gym or fitness facility.

It starts with the people and ends with the amazing location and layout.One subtle but important feature of this hotel is the fact that it is only two stories tall and the resort spreads out across many buildings and at least 4 different pools. So, the resort feels small and relaxing. The staff does an unbelievably nice job of making every guest feel like royalty.Whenever we visit, we never want to leave during our stay (to visit other locations) or at the end (to go home)",Oct 2018,September 2018,Traveled as a couple,,"Menlo Park, California"
619767804,40,A wonderful resort with mixed reviews on service,"This was my first visit to a Four Seasons property. Typically, I don't care about where I stay, since what I care about most is convenience, cleanliness and value. This was a different trip for me, since I knew I would be spending the bulk of my time at the resort with my friends, since we were all there for the Chef Fest.    When I arrived at check in, the bell staff and check in process was wonderful. I arrived a little earlier than check-in time, but was lucky enough to get in. The room was gorgeous, and there was a nice welcome gift waiting for me.    The property is gorgeous. It's what you might expect from a typical resort, but it's not ridiculously huge like the Hilton Waikoloa. There weren't too many guests when I went in September, so it was nice to secure lounge chairs by the beach or pool. The service while enjoying the beach and pool was awesome! Servers came around in just enough frequency to check on us to see if we needed more water or wanted to order anything, but not enough to feel like we were being disturbed. As a special treat during Chef Fest, they were handing out treats so that was a nice surprise. When we casually made mention of how much we liked it, the server was kind enough to ask the chef for more. That was definitely the wow service I expected!    Breakfast at Ulu was a typical hotel buffet breakfast. The gal at the omelet station was wonderful and exuded the aloha spirit. The rest of the servers each morning were also pleasant and helpful.    One night, there were five of us who opted out of that night's Chef Fest dinner. We decided to eat at Hualalai Grille. It was after 7 P.M. and only half the restaurant was full. We waited to be assisted, and after a little while, we were checked in. We were told it would be about a fifteen minute wait, because they were busy. We said it was fine and decided to get a drink at the bar while we waited. There was one person drinking at the bar and it looked like the bartender was drying glasses. As we decided where to sit, we were never acknowledged or greeted. We stood around trying to figure out if we should sit at the bar or on a four top table and bring one chair over, which took a good two minutes or so, as we were also having side conversations amongst each other about another topic. My friend pointed out that it didn't seem like anyone wanted to help us, so we decided to go back towards the hostess stand and wait on the chairs instead.    When we were finally seated and presented with the menus, we were disappointed to see there wasn't any Big Island beef on the menu. Regardless, we were going to order something else. As we discussed what we would be ordering, we realized it had been ten minutes, and no one greeted us, or offered any water to us. We decided to leave the restaurant and eat sushi at Ulu.    As we approached the bell desk, there were two bellmen behind the podium. I asked if we could be shuttled to Ulu, and the one who responded, who I assumed to be the one with more seniority, stated it may be a while for someone to drive up with a cart. This was said, as I glanced over and saw a few carts parked in the corner. The junior person said something to the other one, and the senior person responded by saying, ""No,"" and proceeding with asking him to do something else. Following our experience at the steak house, I became more agitated about the lack of customer service from the resort. Finally, after a few minutes, a driver pulled up and took us over to Ulu.    Once at Ulu, we were quickly seated and greeted immediately by Sharon. She was extremely attentive and we felt like she more than made up for the subpar service we had been experiencing that night. I ordered a chirashi bowl, which had raw fish on top of rice. Although it looked pretty, it was not the best quality ingredients. For the flavor, the price was not worth it. My friend ordered some tobiko and ikura rolls and he also mentioned it was not good, but was so hungry, he ate it. When I mentioned this to Sharon, she was kind enough to take it off our bill.    As I walked the resort the following day, I came across the spa. There was a gentleman there, and his female co-worker, who were just bundles of joy. They exemplified the aloha spirit and were very helpful. He convinced me to obtain a spa service, so I booked a treatment, and convinced two of my girlfriends to join me.  Our massage therapists were all wonderful. I had Kyle, and he was very friendly but allowed me to relax during my treatment. The facility smelled like poop, for some reason, but by the time I returned from my treatment, I could tell the floors were wiped clean and the smell was gone.    There were wonderful servers during the Chef Fest event and there were many others who were wonderful as we passed them along the bath. Housekeeping was also very attentive and friendly.    Upon check out, as I approached the front desk, There was one guest being helped. There were three people clustered together talking, with no one in front of them, so I stood in front of them waiting for their conversation to finish. Each of them saw that I was standing there, but the two gentleman didn't want to seem to interrupt the lady that was speaking, and it appeared she was training them on something. When I realized the guest being helped was gone, I moved over to the other front desk agent and she was kind enough to assist me with my check out.    Would I recommend the resort? Absolutely. My favorite parts included watching the sunset from the beach, swimming under the stars at the heated pool, and having breakfast and seeing spinner dolphins jumping out of the ocean or turtles sunbathing at dusk. Would I make a special trip to return to this resort? Not unless there was a special reason to. For the price paid, I would probably opt for another resort.",Sep 2018,September 2018,Traveled with family,"Try to ask for a room in the 1500 series.

615995250,50,Heaven on earth,"Such a lovely resort! The experience starts when you arrive.... you’re greeted with a mai tai and a lei and are escorted to comfy couches for the check in process. It’s all very attentive and leisurely and something I’ve only experienced at Four Seasons. You then get a golf car ride to your room and an offer of a tour of the resort. The resort itself is BEAUTIFUL with many different paths to meander and beaches to explore. If you want a cabana, there are many available at mo extra charge along with comfy beach chairs that have shades you can pull up. There are also “couples’ nests” if you desire complete privacy. The property has many pools. Not having kids, our favorites were Sunset Cove which is adults only with an infinity edge and a swim up bar and also the “quiet pool”. I’m not a huge Mai Tai fan as usually they’re too full of fruit juice for me, but they are amazing at Sunset Cove! The service is excellent, and throughout the day the bartenders would whip up a special concoction and give everyone samples. Service is great at the quiet pool too...Food is excellent at all the restaurants and there are many choices. In addition to Ulu, Beach Tree, and the gold course steakhouse, you can also go to the residences Beach House for a more casual experience. We also went to the Trading Co once to get yummy sandwiches to take to the beach with us. The rooms have every amenity you could want....nice hair and skin products, robes and slipper, coffee/espresso machine, small frig, huge TV, and a VERY comfy bed. I have back issues and usually sleep miserably in hotels but I slept amazingly here!There are many nice places to stay in Hawaii, but what really makes this resort stand out is the friendliness and excellence of the staff.

Views are better from second floor but first floor rooms often have outside showers. The property is spread out, quiet and peaceful. There are lots of pools. The gym/ spa is incredible but much busier than other resorts I have been to. I assume this because the privately owned villas on the property can use these facilities.  The service was great. The food at the restaurants is good, not great and you are paying the highest prices for it.  If you are a beach going prison, this is not the resort for you.

The service is above a 10 especially around the pools, from cleaning your sunglasses to filling up water and ice buckets they come around all the time and they know your name it's extremely personalized which the Four Seasons is well known for. Ulu the breakfast as signature dinner restaurant is so close to the ocean that you get sprayed with water sometimes that's how close it is the best views for dining. The Palm Grove pool was another favorite of mine for an afternoon Mai Tai (they were delicious) and the overall service and friendliness of the staff is incredible.

611641136,50,Hualalai never disappoints - even during Hurricane Lane,"We just returned to NYC from ~ two-week trip to Hawaii, which was unfortunately impacted by the Hurricane during our last 2.5 days. Fortunately, we still had 5 great nights at the Four Seasons Ko'Olina on Western Oahu (see separate review), followed by 5 nights at the Hualalai (we had to cut our stay one night short to beat a hasty retreat from the island)This was my first time at the Hualalai in 10 years, but I have to say that it was almost exactly as I recalled it...i.e. just about perfect. A couple observations:- I don't remember the ""Ocean Pool"" existing when I was last there, but it's an amazing concept. We went snorkeling in it one day, and when I tried to swim up to a rock, I felt something brush against my stomach...which scared the crap out of me...it was the resident giant sea turtle!! - We stayed in the ""Sea Shell wing"" - right in front of (or behind, as it were) the Sea Shell pool, which is the ""family pool."" If you're staying with kids (our daughters are 6 and 9), I would highly recommend staying in this area so that you're closest to the Sea Shell and Ocean pools.- If you want a more remote/quieter stay with kids, I'd request a room overlooking King's Pond.- Ulu (the sushi place) is probably one of my favorite restaurants in the world. I cannot explain how much I love the kampachi carpaccio with ponzu gelatin, or their spicy tuna handroll. The chocolate soufflé is also sublime. We went their 3x during our stay, and I could have gone more.- I realize that the Beach Tree restaurant (adjacent to the Beach Tree pool) seems to be the most popular...I just don't get why. Ulu is far superior. With that said, if you do really want to eat there, make your reservations early...we didn't bother, and it was at capacity pretty much every night of our stay (kind of annoying when you stay at a hotel but can't get reservations at their restaurant...but that's kind of what you sign up for when staying at the Hualalai, esp during peak times).- Definitely check out the Residents Beach House for lunch/dinner as well. I think they only take same-day reservations for non-residents (hotel guests), but it's worth it!- The Sunset Beach store at the spa is so much better than I remember it. I bought a ton of great stuff. Also great inventory at Sunset Luxe below the lobby.- My only knock, if I have one, is the state of the rooms...we had just come from the Ko""Olina, where the rooms were recently upgraded / all new fixtures. The Hualalai rooms need facelifts.",Aug 2018,August 2018,Traveled with family,,"New York City, New York"

You get a lot for it and we certainly felt that we got a lot of value for what we paid, but not everyone will. If you're staying on the resort, you will pay more for food, drinks, etc.  * If you fly out later in the evening, they're happy for you to use the shower/facilities at the spa so you can enjoy a day by the pool before freshening up to hop on your flight.  * There's some vog some days right now, particularly with the recent eruptions.

606136250,50,Slice of Heaven!!,"We are a family of 7 who stayed in the Kailani Suite rooms 2501/2502 in July. This was a 2 bedroom suite (one King and 2 Queens with a rollaway) located directly next to the beach. Pictures will show our lounge chairs with the background of the terrace to our suite. The terrace had a large table for dining and several loungers for seating. Everyday 7 lounge chairs were set out for our group which was great being so close to our room with young children. We had a nice living area, kitchenette with full refrigerator and Keurig.    Our family travels frequently and we all agree that this might be our favorite hotel at this point. Service is near perfection at this hotel. We spent the first half of our vacation in Oahu (Aulani-Disney Resort) and our 6 year old granddaughter preferred this over Disney. We initially booked this for the second half to recoup from Disney but I wish we had made this the full stay. Lots to do on the island in addition to this wonderful hotel.    Hula Kanda was our Suite Experience Manager and she does not disappoint. Months earlier, we started working with her for our excursions but she made the visit incredible with all of the little details. We had champagne, fruit, chocolate upon our arrival - also toys for the kids, bath sponges spelling out their names above their tub, pillow cases embroidered with their names and bar stocked with all of our favorites. You name it, she thought of it! She handled all of our excursions which were all fabulous. (Paradise Helicopter - the Ultimate Nui Charter. This was a 6 hour helicopter tour with lunch provided and several stops, Kona Ocean Adventures for our scuba dive and day of snorkeling and our Hali'a Family Style Dinner - Dinner Under the Stars) The helicopter tour was incredible but I will wait to review Paradise and Kona later. I will mention that after a long day from the helicopter tour, Hulu had us picked up and delivered to our door.

We wondered why our pilot took pictures, but this was definitely a nice touch to our incredible day.    Dinner Under the Stars (dinner on the beach) was lovely and I would highly recommend. We chose the Hali'a Family Style Dinner which started with cocktails at 6:30 and the evening lasted until 9:00. We had lounge furniture set up on the beach for cocktails and a beautiful white table with tiki torches set for our family. We chose an Hawaiian Acoustic duo and a Hula dancer for our entertainment and they did not disappoint. The evening was just spectacular.    We ate at all of the their restaurants, but our favorites were Ulu and Beach Tree by far. We loved dining by the ocean and the musician was wonderful. I could have listened to him all night! Hualalai Grill was good but not our favorite. Food is just average. Ulu has a wonderful breakfast buffet but we chose to have our breakfast on the terrace every morning but one. It was hard to beat the view and not having to leave our room with the grandkids is always a plus. We had 2 pots of coffee delivered each morning at 6:00am. They were late one morning for 5 minutes and I was actually concerned that my husband had given another time. The fact that I questioned 5 minutes is only to let you know how prompt they are for everything. Any time we had something set up, they were knocking on our door at the exact time - not a minute later.    We loved the Seashell Pool. It was a beautiful pool area and was not crowded at all. We were closer to the Beach Tree Pool (Quiet Pool) but it was a very short walk to go on down to the Sea Shell. Kings Pond is a short walk past Sea Shell and the kids loved snorkeling here. Lots of sea life to view and it was good for the kids to start out here before being whisked off to the ocean for snorkeling. Snorkel gear can be checked out so no need to bring gear.    I had read some unfavorable reviews regarding the beach, but I found it to be very nice. The water is not the Caribbean but this a beautiful beach in a rugged way. There is raw beauty about this beach and of this island. I found it very enjoyable - especially with their exceptional beach staff! We never waited on a drink or anything else for that matter. Make this a bucket list trip - excursions and all. This is a pricey hotel but we all left feeling refreshed and pampered. It was all worth it and we will definitely be back.",Aug 2018,July 2018,Traveled with family,Kailani suite was directly on the beach.,"Jenks, Oklahoma"

We were upgraded to a room overlooking the kids pool with a view of the ocean. What a stunning view! The staff was absolutely the best. They were cheerful and told us tons about the island. My 12 year old daughter loved the crafts and pool- especially the Surf Shack. She spent a few days doing Camp Manitou, which was great because it gave us some down time and her a chance to socialize with other kids. The Camp Manitou staff was fabulous. We didn’t reserve a spot for her and she still was able to go. The vog was nonexistent, the only impact seemed to be fewer people at the pools and restaurants(which was a bonus for us). We had no problem getting a table at all the restaurants without a reservation. The food was sublime! The atmosphere was relaxing and serene.

The second I step foot on the property, I am instantly happy and feel at peace. The grounds are beautiful and very well kept. The spa is fantastic and the gym is my all time favorite. Our last visit was in December and the hotel was quite busy as you'd expect. The wait time for breakfast was excessive and the service there had declined. At lunch and dinner (we never leave the property) the food and service was quite good, but in the past we thought the food was amazing. There used to be amazing lunch specials (creative salads that varied every day) but this time there weren't any specials and there didn't seem to be as much effort put in.

Stunning beach setting in enough acreage to ensure there's peace & quiet - most beautiful sunsets over the ocean, with a view from the bar and restaurant to die for. We ate informally at one beach restaurant for lunch and the more formal grill (also open air and ocean facing) for dinner. Both outstanding.    Beautiful suite of rooms - king size room and 2 queen rooms joined by a central lounge - all the the amenities you expect of a 4 Seasons (outside shower etc). The combined space of the outside lanai gave us the feel of a detached villa and enjoyed a lovely room service meal one evening as a result. Seen a comment on here about some rooms needing refurbishment - certainly not these! (Ocean-facing).    Service is legendary at Four Seasons - you won't be disappointed here - discrete, genuine warmth and sense that everyone enjoys working there. They've nailed hospitality in a way that so many American hotels haven't.    Yes, its very pricey - but so are many Hawaiian hotels relatives to the star rating.

We love going to this resort in February because of the humpback whales. The day we arrived we saw the humpbacks breaching the waters - it was so awesome! Seeing them breach while dining at the excellent restaurants like Ulu and Beach Tree House is such a treat!    They have plenty of cabanas available near the 4 pools at the property. The beach cabanas are plenty as well. The pool staff is very friendly and accommodating and always offer the best service. My family loved that there is a nice beach enclave with more calm waters than the open sea. During low tide, it is cool to checkout and walk around the tide pools. The canoe ride for kids is a nice experience for the little ones.    Kids for All Seasons is the best and my son loves it especially! Their staff is always the friendliest and my husband and I don't ever worry leaving our son in their care. King's Pond also offers eagle ray and fish feedings for kids which is especially cool. You also get to snorkel in King's Pond and see all the marine life around.    I especially love the spa at this resort. This is one of the few FSR that offer guests access to the spa amenities even without getting a service. You truly get to unwind, relax and enjoy the natural surroundings and sounds of the property.    Sea Shell pool is best for families. It is a short walk from our room which was just behind Beach Tree House. The pool is also the closest proximity to Ulu which offers breakfast. Their breakfast buffet is especially good with all sorts of breakfast options. Their made-to-order station is excellent!    When we stayed here back in February, there were a few days with thunderstorms which made for a spectacular lightning show one night. It was a bit out-of-the ordinary to us since it was super heavy rain. One night we ended up eating in. The area just outside the front door flooded a bit as well. But the room service guy was very nice and helped put towels down. They had plenty sandbags to prevent flooding in the rooms.    Even with rain and thunderstorms, we would come here and stay again.

Family - Our family including our 8, 5 and 3 year old were made to feel very welcome and had plenty of pools and beaches to choose from. We stayed 6 nights. I loved that the resort offered a children's lunch buffet on the lawn next to the kids pool, so, we didn't have to worry about lunch arrangements for the kids. The kids aged 8 and 5 enjoyed feeding the sting ray and their short visit to the kid's club.    Plenty of lounge chairs available to select from and are made up for you as soon as you sit down. A refreshing glass of iced water arrives straight away with offers to replace throughout the day. Plenty of staff to assist with any requests.    Staff - amazing! Seemed hand-picked for their genuinely friendly approach and their ease to offer assistance and care for the guests.    Food - amazing!    Tip for the restaurants: The hotel restaurants were popular and can be booked out in advance, so, I would recommend making reservations prior to your arrival.    Activities - Easily arranged through concierge. We took a Paradise Helicopter tour around the island. A highlight - to see the varying island landscapes. We were lucky to see red hot molten lava flowing in to the ocean. The resort & air weren't affected by the recent eruption. The forest area with waterfalls was amazing too. We took a rib-craft and snorkelled with hundreds of dolphins.    Extra touch I appreciated - the laundry ""suites"" that are plentiful and spaced among the rooms.

It was the best time because the hotel was only half full, maybe due to the volcano going on which didn't affect us at all.  From the moment we walked into the resort until the moment we departed we were treated with warmth and kindness.  This was our 2nd visit to Hualalai but the first with just the 2 of us. It was the most perfect 5 days.  We had the buffet breakfast every morning and the servers were all very friendly, and personable. We appreciated Maggie, our server one morning, who gave us the special Kona Coffee, for our anniversary. One of Ulu's manager's, Maggie, was also very friendly and personable. Every server was fabulous.  There is plenty of healthy and g/f options. Plenty of fresh fruit, even salad available.  Definitely recommend to treat yourself with the Kona Coffee French Press, at least once, during your visit.  We also had dinner at Ulu's couple of times. Want to share that Bianca, our server one night, was exceptional. She knew everything on the menu and how it was prepared which helped with our decision on what to order, very appreciated. Our 2nd visit for dinner our server was, Carola, who provided us with a beautiful and tasty dessert for our anniversary. Ulu's restaurant was definitely our favorite for dinner. Sushi and fish and the best spot for watching the sunset.  We also ate at the Beach Tree lunch and dinner. The hostess Deena was wonderful. Our last night we ate here and had the pleasure of meeting Noah and Justin, both managers in training. They were so friendly and fun to talk with. They spoiled us with a spread of various desserts. The bon bons were my favorite.  We mostly hung out at the ""quiet pool"" during the day and were able to choose which cabana we wanted to relax in as the hotel was only half full.  Tori and Keisa, which worked at the quiet pool were always fun to talk to. They were super friendly, everyone was there, and they also spoiled us with a free dessert.  Our room was across from the family pool on the bottom floor, which is our favorite because of the outdoor shower. We weren't affected by any noise from the pool at all. I had my eye glass case by our bed and when the cleaning service came they left a new Four Season eye glass cleaning cloth. I was so appreciative of that small gesture. It's things like THAT that set the Four Seasons apart from any other hotel we've stayed in.  We frequented the gym and the spa. Every amenity you can think of, they provide.  My husband and I went on several walks throughout the day. Every morning and evening we'd walk to the end of the path where you can rent SUP's. They also have free snacks there. We'd take a little swim and hang out on the floating pad not far from the beach.  We also walked in the opposite direction towards the old (but being renovated) resort. There's a black beach and it has great snorkeling.  We never left the resort and could have easily stayed several more days. We never ate at the steak restaurant but heard good things about it.  Another example of exceptional service is I had forgotten to bring my sun hat so I called Lost and Found to see if they had any there I could use for the week. There were 2 hats that had expired in the Lost and Found and they delivered both to me so that I could choose which one I wanted.

586228663,50,Heaven on earth,The Four Seasons Hualalai is as close to heaven on earth as as spot we have ever found. It’s a totally unique experience built as a series of two story buildings in four semi circles facing the sea. It doesn’t feel like a hotel - it’s more of a private tropical playground. So many of the people who come hear visit this property regularly which is the biggest testament to how special this property is and how well managed it is by The Four Seasons. And for those of you worried about the volcano - don’t be - it has no impact on this part of the Island. The weather was great and we had little to no vog at the resort. You have to drive south of the airport to hit vog.,Jun 2018,June 2018,Traveled with family,,"Houston, TX"

583459505,50,Another Outstanding Visit,"This was our fourth visit to this resort and what a wonderfully relaxing visit it was. Our last visit was about 10 years ago and although the resort has changed a little, the important things like unbelievable attention to detail and comfort remain the same. This time around we spent five nights in the Wai'olu suite (1,700 sqft). Perfect location next to the adult pool. Just leave the living room slider unlocked and walk fifty steps or so to the pool and bar that overlooks the ocean. Our room was perfectly clean and in no need of renovation, but we did speak to a couple at the pool that said their room could use a facelift.    We ate dinner at Ulu's once and Hualalai Grill twice, preferring the simpler approach of the latter.    If you have never visited Hualalai, you owe it to yourself to take the plunge. It isn't cheap, but it is a place you won't soon forget. You can spend an entire day marveling the incredible landscaping and the fish at the King's Pond.

I can see how some people may think the rooms are a tad outdated, but they must be a 1 percenter, because the rooms are pretty impeccable. At a place like this, you shouldn’t be spending much time in your room anyhow. The outside shower was awesome and I highly recommend to request one if your on a honeymoon. Our room was cleaned twice a day and the service was great, they folded our clothes and everything. Plenty of USB ports in the room, I thought the USB integrated wall sockets were useful. The free washing machine was very useful too. We stayed here in the middle of our three week vacation so being able to do laundry was very helpful. Staff members were great. The scenery was picturesque. And the sunsets were unforgettable. Lots of other little things make this resort so great. Cleaning your sunglasses at the pool, free sunscreen, and the ability to send text messages to the concierge to make all activity and dinner reservations was very forward thinking and saved time so I could relax.

I hear sometimes they allow children in the adult pool but we preferred it with no kids...sorry families. The little lagoon complete with sting rays and fish is the perfect place for the little ones as it has very shallow water and the kids can swim with the fish. The beach is incredible and you can walk forever. There is also a little grill restaurant on the beach that is in front of the 4 seasons residences that has good grilled food.

The last time we were there children were unruly and the parents seemed to care less. There are residents in property and we ate at a restaurant that caters to owners. Well a fight broke out.

577754628,50,Great Resort,"We (2 adults, 1 8 year old) stayed here for 4 nights at the end of April and had a great stay. This is a great property with lovely grounds, walking trails, helpful staff and excellent food. Here's more info:    - We had a regular room (whatever it's called near the Seashell pool). The room was nice. The outdoor shower was great. Some reviews said that the rooms need updating - we didn't find that to be the case. To be sure, this property isn't new, but it's still super nice. Furnishings were all in excellent condition. Cleaning service was good.  - The food at the property was good. The restaurants all had vegetarian menus (thanks!). Ulu was my favorite for dinner - it is be a bit of a foodie place, which we thought was awesome.  - Some reviews mentioned people holding pool chairs. We did not experience this. The hotel was full when we were there and there were plenty of places to sit at the pools or beaches. Even more, the resort has clear policies that chair holding is not permitted. (I wish more resorts did this. It's not like 5 start resorts have a shortage of chairs, so I've never understood why people hold them anyway).  - Prices are as one would except at a property like this. It's expensive. The service is excellent.  - The King's Pond is pretty cool. My son really enjoyed the eagle ray feeding.  - We enjoyed talking to some of the staff, especially since so many aren't from the Big Island so their thoughts on what to do were useful.  - The gym is great and the lap pool is as good as my Equinox.  - You can swim in the ocean here. The ocean pool right in front is a nice easy plunge and easy for kids due to the breakwall. If you want more beach, Kukio Beach at the end of the property (15 min walk) is a really pretty bay. The walk there is also pretty cool.    I would say in closing that although we thought the resort was really great, we would not return to this particular destination. The Big Island is really great if touring around is your thing. We wanted a short beach get away and had bad luck w/ weather (that can happen in Hawaii). We spent one day driving around the island and that was super cool. We just didn't want to spend more time in the car (we do that at home). To be clear, it isn't awful to lounge at the Four Seasons on a windy cloudy day, but given the flight time from LA + time change, it's just a lot easier for us to go elsewhere for a short break.",May 2018,April 2018,Traveled with family,"If traveling without kids, consider asking for a room near the Quiet or Adult Pool.","Newport Beach, California"

575743485,50,Excellent resort,"The layout of this resort is delightful, set in beautifully landscaped grounds with extensive use of local materials. Accommodation is arranged in small blocks each containing three or four suites. We had paid for a large sea front suite and it really could not have been any nearer the sea. So although it’s a largish resort you don’t get any feeling of that - from most of our large deck we could not see any other rooms, so you really get the feeling of having your own villa by the sea.  We loved The King’s Pool - A huge snorkelling pool carved into the volcanic rock, stocked with 40 species of fish and a ray. The first time a ray swims under you at speed is breathtaking. It get progressively more cloudy during the day with algae bloom, so the best snorkelling is first thing.  We had three excellent dinners at three of the four onsite restaurants but be warned bookings are necessary and even on quieter days the two most popular tend to fully book up a couple of days in advance.  The resort is very isolated. You’ll need to drive to Kailua-Kona to find a restaurant, cafe or shop. A good 30 - 40 minute drive.

575371436,50,Our Favorite Hotel in the World,My wife and I travel to probably over 50 properties a year and this is our favorite. Could not ask for more! The thing the makes this place so special for our experience is the staff. We have been going here for several years and to see the same staff each year and that they remember you is absolutely amazing.,Apr 2018,April 2018,Traveled as a couple,,"Atlanta, United States"
575343518,50,The Best Resort on Big Island-no doubt about it!,"The resort grounds are magnificent, with 4 pools, a snorkelling pond with 4000 fish including an eagle ray, 8 superb tennis courts worthy of holding the ATP tour on, a spa, the largest and most well equipped gym ever, multiple shops and my wife’s favourite, a self help laundry facility with complementary washing pods around every corner, with an adjacent ice machine. A real highlight for us was seeing the turtles swimming in the shallow rock pools or resting on the beach, they are always there, we saw up to 6 during each walk along the beach. There’s a nicely signposted jogging tack offering approximately 2.1, 3.4 and 4.8 mile lengths but it was tough in the heat and humidity, one really needs to go out early before 7am to do this.    The resort layout is very clever, the majority of the rooms face the ocean and are arranged in clusters so it never looks large or crowded, there are two levels only, the upper with a nice sized balcony and the lower with a similar sized outdoor area containing a table and 2 lounging chairs. It’s really arguable whether it’s worth paying for “ocean front” as the “ocean view” are almost as good.    The Rooms:  The rooms are spacious with a huge and comfy but rather soft king sized bed, a small dining table with 2 chairs and a single lounging chair, one large chest of 4 drawers and a massive 65 inch flat screen TV. Note that there is no desk as such to work from, but a major plus is the multi plug adapter at each side of the bed that includes 2 USB ports with a total 3.1A output so can charge an iPad and iPhone at the same time. There is also one of these on the small table. The bathroom is large with his & hers basins, separate WC, very large shower and an additional very private outdoor shower. The amenities are in refillable 4 Seasons bottles and are actually very nice, even if they are not well known branded products.    The Pools:  These are simply magnificent, there is a huge family friendly “activities” pool where the families with kids go, the “quiet” pool with tons of loungers with umbrellas and cabanas, and the “adult” only pool with a swim up bar but with a relatively small number of loungers, under 25 I would guess. All offer a different lunch menu, and the complimentary freshest nicest iced spring water ever. Be aware that these all use a salt water chlorination system so the water is very slightly salty and can make one itch if you don’t rinse off in the fresh water shower afterwards. The attendants will bring complimentary smoothie tasters each day, but no cold face cloths, cool sprays or sunglasses cleaning you might find in other high-end resorts. They do offer complementary suntan lotion and leave-in conditioner which my wife raved about. Melissa at the “quiet” pool was simply fantastic and deserves special mention. It’s important to be aware that you can’t “reserve” loungers by putting personal items on them, except over lunch when you are allowed to do this for 2 hours. If loungers are unattended after 15 minutes personal items are removed to make them available for other guests, this is actually a good thing. I should mention there is also a training pool at the gym for doing laps, and next to the activities pool there is a well equipped shop selling kids water toys including giant inflatable turtles and manta rays, balls, suntan lotion, googles, ice cream and iced lollies.    The restaurants:  There are 4:  Ulu- for breakfast (buffet or ala carte) and evening dinner, biased towards seafood/sushi. Quite honestly, I thought the breakfast options were pretty mediocre and compare poorly with that offered by resorts in Asia or Australia, but the dinner is excellent.  Hualalai Grill - an excellent steakhouse  Beach Tree - Californian/Italian fare- very nice  The Residence-this forms part of the resident owners club and they have first option  You could expect to pay a minimum of US$250 for a couple having starters, mains and a glass of wine each by the time gratuity and taxes are included. There are no nearby restaurants outside the resort one can walk to, the nearest are at least 15-20 minutes drive away.    The Shops:  There are two excellent boutiques, an uninspiring jewellery store and the Trading Post which is something special. Not only can you buy the best coffee there, you can get fresh smoothies, sandwiches, breakfast items to take away or eat outside but also every conceivable snack item, drinks (alcohol/non-alcoholic), toiletries, souvenirs, clothing- it’s superbly equipped.    Other recommendations:  1. Swimming with Dolphins- Kona Ocean Adventures, with Momi and Daniel who are excellent and fun guides, the boat with a large sun cover takes small groups, 6 on our day, for a 4 hour trip to swim with the Dolphins- they even offer a guarantee, if no dolphins are seen they will take you out free on another day. Snorkelling year is provided as are non-alcoholic drinks and a rather nice lunch, for around $200 per person.  2. Helicopter tour with Sunshine Helicopters-over the whole island to see the volcanoes and waterfalls. Ian our ex-military Blackhawk instructor was a superb pilot and commentator. Two tips- a)check whether the lava is actually flowing otherwise there is very little volcanic activity to see as in our case, the huge waterfalls on the northern side of the island were well worth the trip anyway, b) option the extra spacious front two seats with superb view - well worth the extra cost approx $100.  3. Boat Trip to see lava flowing into the ocean-not current,y available as lava not flowing.  4. Manta Restaurant at Mauna Kea Hotel- about 30 minutes taxi drive north, do a really nice dinner, beautiful setting overlooking a magnificent large beach, and when it gets dark 7-8pm you can see the Manta rays swimming at the shoreline just below you attracted by the lights that shine into the water. Suggest get a 6-6.30pm booking.    So what was the down side to this magnificent resort? (1) The 4 Seasons service is justifiably legendary however we did have an issue where one evening we had no turn down service and the next morning the room wasn’t made up. This was promptly rectified by management in response to a phone call, a manager attended personally after the service to check all was ok and brought a plate of chocolate treats as an apology which was appreciated.(2) A couple of mornings we had no hot water but as it didn’t inconvenience us we never raised the issue. (3) The room decor is very dated, they are not plush by any means, although more than comfortable.(4) This is not a resort to offer sea swimming or activities as it is surrounded by volcanic rock, getting past that to paddle board or swim is only possible at high tide and quite hazardous, no-one tried it while we were there, although there are a couple of “lagoons” where one can swim which are actually ancient Hawaiian fish traps. (5) While the resort is pricey and so are the meals, I think it’s unnecessary to charge for use of the tennis courts, or paddle board or canoe assuming you were mad enough to even attempt the latter. (6) While there is free wi-fi throughout the resort (unlimited devices, easy login) it’s pretty slow at 1-2 Mbps, ok for email but unsuitable for downloading larger files or streaming, one could opt for a premium paid for service at $25 per day but that only offers “double the speed” so probably not worth it.

574450656,10,Terrible Service!,"I have never experienced such terrible service at a Four Seasons Hotel! We waited 20 minutes for a table on our first morning for the buffet breakfast and 30 minutes the 2nd morning. The restaurant was less than half full. There were 20+ people waiting to be seated and nobody seemed to care. I made a complaint and a manager came and saw us and said they only want their servers to look after 3 tables at a time so that's why we were expected to wait 30 minutes for a seat and half the restaurant was empty! When someone finally came and took our requests for drinks, they would return with 1 or 2 of the drinks and never come back with the rest. We had to get up and ask for clean cutlery and dirty plates piled up around us. The service continued to be bad when we went to the restaurants for dinner. We would be seated then nobody would come and see us for 20 minutes or if they did, they would come and take the drinks order and then not return for ages. The only time we got good service was when the staff saw the manager of food & beverage talking to us. The rest of the time we were ignored. I don't know what has happened with the staff in the restaurants there because it's never been like that before. We stayed 8 nights and nobody tried to fix anything until our last night there even though I had complained after our 2nd night.",Apr 2018,April 2018,Traveled with family,,"Gold Coast, Australia"
573847723,40,"Wonderful Resort, Crowds Can Impact Value","Recently stayed at FS Hualalai for eight nights with my wife as we are expecting our first and wanted to get away as a couple one last time. It was the week after the usual spring break crowds, but still very busy.    First off, the resort grounds and surrounding Hualalai area are stunningly gorgeous. The grounds are kept up with exquisite detail. One of the things we enjoyed the most was taking a 4.5 mile stroll around the perimeter of Hualalai every morning. It’s paradise.    Second, the staff was simply wonderful, period full stop. Floyd, Paul, Bronson and Bianca at Ulu were all spectacular, and really enjoyed our time with Mike and Jeff at the bar at Beach Tree. Everyone got all the little things right, but perhaps more importantly they are just good people to get the chance to meet. The people made the trip for us.    We did use the spa and gym. We were able to get spa appointments at the time we wanted with about 24 hours notice, which was nice. The facility was top notch, the service fantastic. The steam room was amongst the best I’ve been in. The gym is very large and top flight.    Here’s a lense in which I compare the overall value:    Having stayed at the StR Bora Bora, Palmilla, Las Ventanas, Rosewood Jumby Bay, Six Senses Koh Yao Noi, and others of that caliber, from a grounds, spa, food and beverage perspective, Hualalai is top flight and competitive. There is a bit of a difference here in regards to value that does need to be mentioned. This is comparable, if not more expensive in price than the others. It’s a bigger property, and thus there are more people and a lot of families. Generally speaking, if you want a beach/pool lounger when the resort is busy, you are out of luck if you don’t claim one by 10 or 10:30. One of the mornings they were all claimed by 9:30. Some mornings, all of the loungers at the adult pool were claimed (not occupied, but claimed) by 8:30am. At the Hilton, Marriott, or that caliber hotel I can live with this. At the FS with a rack rate starting at about $1,500 per night, the rat race for a chair falls short of both expectations and acceptability, even when it’s busy. At that price point one shouldn’t have to make a decision about getting breakfast versus getting a seat by the pool if they sleep in a bit. This may not bother some, but again this is a FS management issue and not in anyway meant as a criticism to hotel staff. The hotel is not a couples retreat, and people are willing to pay premium prices regardless, so you do have to take that into consideration.    Another note, they do corporate events/conferences/retreats and there were a few of them during our time there. It creates a situation where a large group of people that know each other can take over a section of the resort. While we were there, one of these groups took over the adult pool for a number of days and treated it more as if they were at a party than one would expect at a FS. Had a lot of other guests we spoke to a bit bewildered. Again, not an issue in and of itself, but something you don’t expect to encounter at a certain price point.    The rooms are nice and well appointed, perhaps a bit outdated and have somewhat of an “ordinary” feel for what you’re paying. That’s not to say they are not nice, we had no complaints.    The takeaway here for me is this. It is a wonderful resort with a wonderful staff. Perhaps the best in Hawaii. I do believe that there are better values to be found at the same price point when it comes to crowds and rooms, just maybe not in Hawaii.",Apr 2018,April 2018,Traveled as a couple,,"San Francisco, California"

573371685,50,One of the best hotel stays ever!,"We stayed here for three nights as part of a three week trip to the islands and it was a real highlight of the trip - I think that they’ve thought of everything! The resort is fairly isolated from the outside world (think the nearest town must be around 30 min drive?) but why would you leave? It has four fabulous (and different) restaurants, a beautiful beach, swimming pools around every corner and even its own “exotic fish lagoon” which is simply beautiful to (safely) snorkel or just to sit by and relax...  We’re not really golfers, but the golf course and amenities look very special...  The beachside suite we were lucky enough to enjoy, was just so luxurious and again, all the little touches of big screen TVs in each room, a gorgeous beach view lanai, which still felt secluded, the four seasons touch of walk in closet, etc, etc... and, a big deal for me, we’re travelling for 3 weeks and so laundry becomes an issue - not here! At very convenient-points across the resort, there are free laundry rooms (so no having to save up your quarters!!) and they also supply the washing pods and dryer sheets! So welcome!!

572031506,50,Luxury meets Paradise!!!,"Stayed there for a few nights with my family to attend a wedding. The whole wedding party and different events took place at the hotel property. It was an Indian wedding and can I say it was picture perfect against the backdrop of black lava rocks, soft beach sand, turtles lazing next to us and stunning, pristine ocean. The property is massive and we did take golf carts to different points. The breakfast buffet in the mornings was at the sea side restaurant and I could not get enough of the fresh tropical fruit and pastries.  There is snorkelling equipment available free of charge and my 10 year old and I went snorkeling by the beach. No need to go far into the ocean. You can see corals and colorful fish close to the beach itself. We had turtles swimming not far us every time we went into the ocean. Of course you have to be mindful and not get too close to them and respect their space.  The infinity pools were heaven and what a way to relax with a drink in the pool right before a night of party.  The property was even able to fly in chefs from their SFO branch to prepare an Indian theme feast for us the night of the engagement party. Replete with fresh flowers and stunning bonfire lamps to light up the place, the engagement venue was heavenly.  So was the wedding evening. Ceremony took place at the beach followed by a stunning reception indoors at their banquet space.  Their staff was friendly, attentive and very warm. We had a little one with us and they had all supplies handy in case of need or emergency.  Though the property itself has plenty of restaraunts, there are other less pricey options too. The marketplace close to the spa area, sells supplies, milk, sandwiches, coffee in case you want a quick bite and not spend over the top on every meal.

571152469,30,Price performance?,"Overall we truly enjoyed our visit to Kona and Hualalai, however I have to question the price performance on the room rates and fees we encountered here. I, like many other reviewers, strongly suggest a remodel on the rooms. They are dated, musky in odor, and did not meet the expectation of a $1300 price tag per night. We did not receive housekeeping for our first two days there and finally called to find out why. We were given some reason that they sometimes arrived later than 2 pm. ?? They didn’t arrive at all for 36 hours until we called. As other visitors encountered during Spring Break we had difficulty arranging for restaurant reservations. At this resort you are somewhat trapped into the resort restaurants due to the distance from the main town. If you are taking a reservation for a very expensive room you should have dining accommodations for those guests. Our alternative was buying chips and dip at the general store (seriously?!). There was NO alternative for us to eat otherwise. I also agree with beach chair issues at the pool. Overall, there is major room for improvement. The grounds are lovely and the staff were as expected on a whole for a Four Seasons resort. But when commanding the room charges that this resort does - more should be delivered to your guest.",Apr 2018,March 2018,Traveled with family,,
570464579,50,"Almost rated at ""4"" this time but, honestly, it's still a solid ""5""","We've been visiting Kona for nearly 20 years and have made 14 trips to Hualalai. We've witnessed multiple changes to the 4S @ Hualalai over the decades some for the worse and some for the better. We have visited during slow seasons (between Thanksgiving and Xmas) and this trip, during the busy Spring break season. We have traveled there during weak tourism years and strong tourism years. There is no doubt that the 4S @ Hualalai has substantially increased their prices over the past 10 years to the point where it is exceedingly expensive for families.    What has not changed over the decades is the wonderful people that work there and make it the wonderful place to vacation in Kona. Going into this trip, we kind of expected a little less personal service that we received during ""off seasons"" when the resort was less busy. And, there were some minor annoyances which are not characteristic of the experiences we have had in the past likely due to the resort operating at full capacity. For instance, we had some issues with housekeeping coming late for both services. We also had an issue at breakfast with a mislabeled pastry that actually contained Mac nuts (we have a child with severe nut allergies). However, in each instance, the Four Seasons staff proactively went out of their way to address the situation and rectify it. I'd especially like to recognize Thomas Bellec, the Executive Chef at 'Ulu for his personal attention.    Some issues such as lounge chair availability is always going to be more of an issue during busy seasons such as spring break and one should plan accordingly. But, as frequent travelers to Kona and the 4S @ Hualalai would recommend some tips which help tremendously during busy seasons and some other quick tips.    1. If a very close ocean view is not necessary, the golf-ocean villas are a better bargain and have a partial ocean view (just farther away) and a beautiful view of the 18th green. They also have parking right in front of the villas which makes it very convenient if you have a car. The rooms themselves are identical to the standard (non-suite) rooms on the complexes around the pools. We reserved 2 adjoining rooms (1 with a king bed and 1 with 2 queens) for our family.    2. Breakfast at 'Ulu is our favorite place for breakfast in the world for the breadth and quality of food and the location. Just plan on getting there before 8 am if you want seating right away. It's easy for us jet lagged midwesterners.    3. Dining in Hawaii is amazing, and we can recommend 'Ulu and the Hualalai Grill unequivocally at the 4S. But, there are amazing places outside the 4S definitely worth checking out. Roy's at Waikoloa and Merrimans in Waimea are other more fine dining options definitely worth the trip. But, ABOVE ALL, email the 4S concierge (who usually sends an email weeks before your arrival) to make all your preferred dining reservations especially during busy weeks.    4. The Spa is bar none, the best spa we have experienced in the US. Also, email the concierge for preferred times for treatment appointments especially during busy weeks.    5. The golf course is a very nice resort course that is never too busy and can be played very quickly usually (I got around in 2 hours as a single). I haven't really made tee times during even busy seasons and have never had an issue getting on. If you need an early tee time, I would make it in advance however. The course itself is pretty easy with wide open fairways. The greens are really slow however when I've played which is a little annoying. The course is not really oceanside with really 1 hole (#17 par 3) that plays along the ocean. For golf on the Big Island, do not miss Mauna Kea.    Overall, given the cost of staying at the 4S and the minor annoyances we experienced during this trip (our 14th to Hualalai including once renting a house), I was considering a 4 rating. But, the response of the fantastic 4S staff, really do make this a 5 rating experience even at this price point IMO. The best endorsement I can give?

570247588,20,Mistake to come during spring break,"Our kids were dreaming to come to Hawaii during spring break. They have never been there. So, we thought ok- especially when 4 seasons is there with such great reviews. But what a huge disappointment! Never again!  Four seasons- if you can not provide service to all the guests, do not sell rooms! Do not book to your full capacity when you can not provide service. Do not rip off you long term clients!    Lines and wait lists.. to have a breakfast - 20-30 min wait! And then wait for 30 min to get your breakfast! What a lounge chair - need to get up at 6 am to reserve! Otherwise no luck. We are sharing 2 chairs only in the afternoon. When we arrived I tried to reserve dinners. No luck! Booked for whole week! All the restaurants. Wait lists.. we started to joke - maybe a waitlist to complain too.    If we went to all inclusive 3 star resort- ok expected. But at 4 seasons, paying top dollars you expect good service. Now it is a struggle to get food or relax.    Shared my experience with other guests - they feel the same.

Every inch of the property is perfectly manicured and deliberate but it still feels like a tropical jungle wonderland. The room is my favorite room I’ve ever had at any hotel. I got the inside scoop from a friend to call ahead and request a downstairs room with the outdoor shower which turned out to be probably my boyfriend and my favorite amenity, which is saying a lot consdering there are four pools/swimming areads each with a unique vibe - a snorkling pond, a family fun pool, a gorgeous reflection pool and an adult pool. The whole place was full while we were there and yet we felt we had the place to ourselves. Nothing feels busy. The beaches are perfect. There are sun lounges with pull-over shade pods and excellent service. The restaurants on property are amazing and really there is no reason to leave the resort.

564005226,40,Perfection is hard to maintain!,"I write this report with a mix of sadness thinking about what used to be and hope that early intervention can restore this amazing property to its former glory. By way of context, I have stayed at this resort many times over the last 15 years and this resort has been a big part of my family's history. My kids have grown up there, we've had family celebrations on property, and we've made lots of great memories. You can read my review from December 4, 2014 to confirm my fanboy status for Hualalai. It has been about 14 months since I last stayed at this resort and my stay then was amazing.    So I was relieved when my kids informed us that they wanted to go back to Hualalai for winter break--I know this place and it is easy to put a vacation together without hours of planning! We just finished 9 days of Hualalai so we got a pretty good sampling of all of the resort. Unfortunately, the level of service and quality of the food have definitely declined compared to the past. To be sure, they are still better than most resorts and if you didn't know the way it used to be, you wouldn't perceive anything egregiously out of order. But for me, the erosion of service levels and food makes the value calculation much more difficult to justify. Staying at this resort is at least double what you would spend at other resorts along the Kohala Coast, so it is an expensive undertaking. In the past, justifying the extra cost was relatively easy given the incredible service and the amazing attention to detail. After this last trip, I'm skeptical about whether the current experience justifies the cost .    The biggest change was the staff. They appear overworked and fatigued and the hustle factor just wasn't in evidence. I talked with some of the staff I know and they confirmed that they are severely understaffed and everyone is stretched to the limits. I feel bad for them and hope that management can provide some relief. We definitely felt that staffing crunch because they have cut back on a lot of amenities. In 10 days, not a single staff member offered to clean my sunglasses, the little treats offered by the pool were minimalistic compared to the past, if I wanted food or drink I had to get up and seek out a staffer, and so forth. None of that upsets me and I am totally capable of doing all of that for myself, but in the past all of that was automatic at this resort and it was nice to have an effortless day with some pampering. It is what you pay all that money for!!    Service at the restaurant was also abnormally poor. The waiters were inexperienced and actually had been pulled from other parts of the resort to staff the restaurant. Service was confused and slow and dinner turned into quite a marathon. Fortunately the view was dreamy!    Similar experiences occurred in other parts of the resort. Despite being a busy week, the spa was almost deserted. I had to wait a long time just to check in for a massage because nobody was at the desk. There was no attendant to help with robes and towels and the locker room was messy with discarded towels and robes on the floor. I went to the main hotel desk in the middle of the day to make an inquiry into an activity and it was deserted. I waited awhile and finally got annoyed and left.    Those are just a few examples of the changes, there are more. I write this with the best of intentions and I am putting it on this forum because Four Seasons management clearly pays attention to it. Many of the on-property managers are new and I suspect that they don't have the institutional memory that I have and they may not even realize that things have slipped a little. I would have gently informed them myself, but unfortunately they were not out and about like the used to be talking to the guests. In the past, over the course of the stay, I would meet every manager of every component of the resort because they were very visible and engaging. On this stay, I didn't encounter a single manager.    I hope the perspective of a long time guest has some value and that they are able to make some changes to attain the unique perfection that Hualalai has been famous for over the years.",Mar 2018,February 2018,Traveled with family,,"Salt Lake City, Utah"
563794164,40,Incredible in (Almost) Every Respect,"Stayed here for five nights with my family (last of three hotels on a 10-day Hawaii trip). We had an Oceanfront room and three teenage sons had an Ocean/Golf View room. Four Seasons rarely disappoints, and I seriously debated four or five stars for this review, but it just didn't earn five this time.    The property is stunningly beautiful, with every architectural, landscaping and lighting detail perfectly executed -- the hotel buildings, villas and homes all blend right in to their natural surroundings. We lost count of whales breaching and sea turtles basking... Truly paradise, 15 minutes from Kona airport.    Check in went beyond the usual lei... sit down and relax with a cocktail and a chilled towel, take in the view, chat with the host, etc. Not just ""card and ID sir?"" The rooms met or exceeded our expectations, with amazing ocean-front views for us and surprisingly beautiful ocean and sunset perspectives from the boys' golf view room. Both were reasonably large and had updated bathrooms (ours with an outdoor lava rock garden shower).    There are four pool areas at FS Hualalai (with hotel rooms discretely placed in crescents around each of them). None felt too crowded or overwhelmed (in fact nothing on property did).    Kings Pond was a major highlight. I frankly wasn't expecting much but we all found snorkeling among the 4,000 fish and feeding the Eagle Ray to be very cool.    Our experience at the Sea Shell pool, on the other hand, was an unmitigated disaster. I never complain about cost at expensive hotels, but we (in retrospect, foolishly) reserved a daybed for three days at $400/day, expecting the attentive service and amenities we've always enjoyed at FS resorts. This time the towel service was slow/non-existent, I had to chase down a server every time we wanted something, and every. single. day. we were charged for the ""free"" cocktails and appetizer that were supposed to be included in our daybed package, which required me to go back up to the desk to find someone to adjust the check. Relaxing? We rarely had the same person helping us twice which undoubtedly contributed to the lousy and inconsistent service. Oh, and by the way, it wasn't busy at all...    Next time I will go to Beach Tree pool, which allows children as long as they're quiet (they can go back to Sea Shell to be kids...) and seemed to have much more attentive and consistent service that we unfortunately only discovered on our last day. Get there early as their ""cabanas"" are first-come, first-serve.    Palm Grove (21+ pool) looked amazingly relaxing and appeared to have a 2:1 service to guest ratio, including an in-pool bar. Perhaps FS is telling families to go elsewhere?    Restaurants all exceeded expectations. Our favorite was Hualalai Grill which is actually off ocean but has elevated water and sunset views, an amazing atmosphere, fun bar, and really great service (and my sons all like steak...). Only minor issue here was my first three wine choices (but still on the list...) were no longer available. Ulu was great for breakfast every day, and was my favorite oceanfront dinner on property. Resident's beach house was also good for dinner but our favorite lunch spot by far. Beach Tree is good for lunch (can get busy, wait, etc...) and a more low-key dinner.    Concierge service was amazing and consistent with all prior FS experience. Arranged a great helo tour (Paradise Helicopters) and guide for a full day on the other side of the Big Island, including lava flows and a hike as well as canyon waterfalls, ocean front cliffs and lots of whales... Also connected us with Ihu Nui for a great day of deep-sea fishing, who hooked us up with a 400 lb Blue Marlin.    Never made it to the gym or the spa, but it's a spectacular property to run around, with a nice five mile loop along the ocean, up into the golf courses, through the homes, and back down to the resort.

563263733,50,Beautiful resort,"The resort is privately located within a community and lies between a golf course and the ocean. It is the perfect setting for total relaxation away from all the tourist action within other parts of the island. The golf course and landscaping are immaculate and make you feel surrounded by nature. Our room had a wonderful view of the ocean and the pool so we could wake up to the sound of the waves daily. With that said, all rooms at the resort do not have the same view. Be sure to specify and request a view if this is important to you. There are 3 separate pools- kid friendly, relaxation and adult only- therefore, you have your choice daily based on your preferences. The restaurant food is wonderful and staff is always willing to assist. The only issue is that the surrounding community does enjoy the Four Seasons amenities; therefore, it can get busy at times. We had to reserve a chair early if we wanted time at the adult pool and the gym/restaurants were busy nightly.

This resort is fantastic for families with children. There are many activities for the kids and all we saw were having a blast. There are all kinds of pools here of all types. A pool for every taste. The beach has a mini wall that keeps the ocean from pounding the beach in front of the resort. Perfect for kids to safely play in the water.  The restaurants here are also wonderful and the servers in the restaurants or in the resort are all wonderful kind and engaged.  It’s the little things that get missed that detract from the experience. No daily cleaning of the dead leaves that fall in a tropical setting. Sand bags by our door to keep the water out. Our room, 804, the front door faced the back of the restaurant and picked up that noise as well as greasy water that ran to our sidewalk. We could here people upstairs moving furniture or using the toilet. Make sure you specify maid service when you check in or you may get back to your room in mid afternoon and find the room still in disarray. We also had several turn down services missed. We also scheduled a vendor for a lei making class but the hotel wouldn’t assist me in paying for the service despite instructions in our itinerary to the contrary.

562526852,40,"Luxurious, but didn't live up to my expectations","I am lucky enough to have been at the Four Seasons on the Big Island, so I don't mean to complain... but, a resort is a resort at any price. On the plus side, you could get a clean towel any time you wanted, there were many pools to choose from (fewer if you are with kids), and the food tastes great. It all just seemed a bit generic; the food didn't seem to emphasize local, a pool is a pool, etc. And it's crowded; probably could be more crowded elsewhere, but it's still just a bunch of tourists clustered close together around a pool. Even though the Big Island is one of the most miraculous bits of nature around, resort life isn't about nature. It's about plastic cups of water being constantly tossed out and refilled. Before this stay, I hadn't realized that 5 star Ecolodges are so qualitatively different from 5 star resorts.

562006811,50,"Best Honeymoon EVER - Thank you, Four Seasons Hualalai!","Best stay ever. We love luxury, gorgeous scenery, delicious food, ultimate relaxation, and exceptional service - Four Seasons Hualalai checked all of our expectations and more!    We stayed here for our honeymoon and Four Seasons surprised us on our arrival with an incredible upgrade to this huge presidential suite overlooking the ocean and golf course. We were greeted with delicious, refreshing Pogo juice in coconut shell cups, fresh towels, and a thorough explanation of our room.    The flowers leis weren't normal leis - they smelled beautiful and were gorgeous compared to leis I've received at the Four Seasons Maui and other Hawaiian resorts. These had plumeria (omg, the scent is overwhelmingly amazing!) and cute little Hawaiian purple flowers.    Napua was so kind and helpful when we checked in and when we checked out - wow, she deserves a promotion for her calm, professional, overly helpful, sincerely nice, and genuinely courteous demeanor. Superb customer service! Her helpful and friendly customer service was synonymous with the entire working staff we encountered during our memorable stay.    The room service was superb and the food was delicious! Loved the seafood loco moco - I had that three times because it was so good! The white sand beaches on the resort were so nice and we loved seeing the sea turtles resting on the beach! We also enjoyed having an acai bowl every morning at the cafe next to the spa - so fresh and one of the best we've ever had! Since we were on the island for two weeks, we definitely needed to fuel up our rental, and that was no problem at the resort because Hualalai has their own fueling gas station right in front of the cafe and next to the spa.    The suite had two balconies and two openings. The rooms were very spacious - the living room was huge with a 75inch tv and fan, the guest bathroom was nice (aloha to the two huge moths on the walls, lol), the master bed room was beautifully designed with a 75inch television and fan, and the bathroom was my favorite due to the open space, open walk-in closet, hot tub, standup shower, and it's separate bathroom toilet. We seriously lived like a king and queen during our stay - best honeymoon ever!    The only complaint I have is probably the overly priced spa services that were just meh (I got my make up done for the photo shoot here and it was not good; my husband hated his overpriced haircut), but that's the spa, not the resort.    Every day was perfect at the Four Seasons Hualalai. We took our honeymoon photos with our wedding photographer on the premises, and they turned out amazing!!! Even their restaurant, Beach Tree Bar, had hosts and guests celebrate our honeymoon with us - they all bought us champagne, entrees, and desserts. Wow! What a grand experience! Everyone was so generous and thoughtful - kudos to the Beach Tree Bar hosts for their amazing service.    We can't wait to come back to celebrate our anniversaries, birthdays, etc. Maybe a baby-moon this year?!

The variety of swimming pools makes up for that in my opinion.  The staff is what makes this resort special, for instance Concierge Summer, who was just wonderful in helping us decide what activities on and off the resort we might enjoy. She made reservations as necessary and all were first class.The driving tours of the island,she suggested, helped us enjoy so much more of the island then we knew existed.    Once again, our favorite restaurant on the resort was the Residents' Beach House, where we enjoyed great food, as well as watching breaching whales followed by some of the best sunsets we have ever witnessed. The staff was extremely friendly and efficient. The only issue was that you could not make a confirmed reservation, you could request a desired time and then you would have to wait until approximately 3:30pm the day you requested to be notified if your reservation was confirmed.

Have to note the breakfast buffet here is one of the best I’ve ever experienced! The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the prices. Yes, I know everything is imported and we are at a Four Seasons but it just seemed like they really took it to you when dining and ordering drinks.

561365269,50,Typical Four Seasons experience but a shout out to the extraordinarily friendly golf staff,"We have stayed here many times in the past, primarily because of the outstanding Four Seasons service. This visit my wife and I were on a golf package and interacted with the golf staff on a daily basis. What a great group of guys. In particular, Hank, Dennis, Stephen were friendly, helpful and just a lot of fun to be around. Sid (who drives the beverage cart 4 days a week) we have known for years and he is the most friendly and outgoing person you could ever meet. All aspects of the Resort are good but I particularly wanted to single out the golf staff who made our golfing days so enjoyable. I also want to recognize Cora, the breakfast hostess at Ulu who remembers us from year to year and is always ready with a smile and conversation.    If I were to offer any constructive criticism, I would focus on pool seating. Coming off the golf course at around 1:30 PM each day, it was sometimes difficult to get any cabana or beach chairs with covers. Adding additional seating might help.  Prices have also crept into the danger zone on food. $19 margaritas don’t even exist in NYC and $39 for a bowl of spaghetti bolognese at Beachtree is pushing the limits. Other than that, the grounds, staff and ambience of the resort make this a go to destination as long as you are willing to pay the price.",Feb 2018,February 2018,Traveled as a couple,,"Greenville, South Carolina"

The golf course was a treat to play and very easy to book a tee-off time. Had three separate treatments at the spa which were heavenly!! They have an ocean pathway which was a pleasure to walk. The beaches of coarse were somewhat full of small lava rocks and broken coral but that is to be expected. We saw saw sea turtles resting peacefully on the beach!

561341541,40,Another nice Four Seasons resort!,"The resort is fairly secluded so if you are looking to go off property you’ll need to rent a car and drive twenty minutes plus to go shopping or to try another restaurant. The design of the property is very nice. There is a ton of space with multiple pools, which gives guests a feeling that the hotel is not fully booked when it fact it maintains a high occupancy level almost year round. We stayed in a one bedroom suite with a partial ocean view (see photo from patio), which had two bathrooms and a fold out couch. It was very comfortable. Maid service, bell service, concierge, etc. were excellent. I have to say all staff members were very attentive and took great care of us.  The biggest highlight for our twelve year old son was the lagoon pool that has many different types of fish. Snorkels, masks and fins are available to use at the lagoon so you to can swim with the fishes! Conversely, my wife’s favorite pool was the “quiet” pool. Children of a certain age are allowed to use the pool but they must stay quiet and you may not speak on the phone while there. There is a family pool for those, like our son, that crave a louder atmosphere.  There are plenty of activities available from golf to the usual snorkeling and water sports, spa, kid’s club plus Hawain cultural actities at the on-site cultural center. You can just hangout at the pool or stay pretty busy. We went off property for a couple of fishing trips that were arranged via the concierge and had a great time. Rental cars are also available through the concierge.  Of the three restaurants available we enjoyed Beach Tree the most for dinner and lunch. They have very good pizza and we liked all of the dinner choices we tried. For lunch the Nicoise Salad was our favorite. The Hualalai Grille is a steak house on property that is good, but very expensive (everything here is expensive). I would say that it is probably not as good at your favorite steak house at home and costs even more, however it’s not bad. We did not enjoy the Ulu Ocean Grille. The menu was a bit strange and the food was marginal. Breakfast was great every morning. There is a huge breakfast buffet with an omelet station or you may chose from an a la cart menu.  In summary, a very nice resort that lives up to the Four Seasons standard of service. We travel to Hawaii at least once a year, usually two or three times, staying at the Four Seasons Maui / Wailea. Hualalai is a much more laid back environment. Things we missed from Maui included the beach and the ability to quickly get off property to local shops and restaurants. Things we really liked about Hualalai included the feeling that the resort was not over crowded and the generally very relaxed atmosphere. We will be back to Hualalai, but we will always ask ourselves wether or not it is worth the additional expense over Wailea / Maui.  Finally, a thank you to the staff. They were great!!

I wonder where else they have all stayed.    For sure the grounds are amazing. That is where the good starts and stops. The room we are in which I am fine paying $1500 per night plus all the taxes and add ones is $2000 a night. That’s fine if It’s nice but it’s tired and worn out. This place desperately needs a face lift. Now let’s talk service. Some are amazing. But we were just told we had to leave the pool because they were setting up for a private party. That was wrong but we agreed. Then it took them 30 minutes to wait on us in our relocated seats. Then our drink order was delivered 30 minutes later and on top of that it was wrong. And then, when we left, they cornered me and accused me of not paying. Which of course I had. I wish they had waited on us as fast as they accused me of trying to not pay my tab.

The spa is wonderful, although the outdoor women's area is small, but packed with all the expected amenities (steam room, aromatherapy showers, cold plunge pool, hot tub...). The fitness center is incredible with various spin classes, Peleton bikes, etc. While there is a protected area to swim in the ocean (which is divine), don't expect to grab a SUP and take it directly out as there are waves that break consistently and there isn't direct ocean access (at least during our stay in Jan/Feb).

559874781,50,Fantastic,"The first thing to know about this fantastic resort is that, if you think about it in terms of value you will come up with a different opinion of it than I have. There is no rational way to justify $1500 (plus about 14% state tax!) per night for a (lovely!) hotel room (but also pools with attendants, restaurants, fitness buildings, and. acres and acres of lovingly maintained landscaping). If spending $22 for a martini or well north of $100 for breakfast buffet for 2 will make you crazy, don't come.    So, if you can get past that issue, you are in for a treat. We arrived after 24 hours of travel and were greeted with such wonderful hospitality. Absolutely everyone we met- certainly front desk and bell staff but also housekeepers, maintenance guys, and gardeners (!) met us with eye contact, a smile, and an ""aloha"" or a ""good morning."" Remarkable customer service training, the best we've seen.    Our room looked out on King's pond, which we liked. It's not a standard Hawaii beach scene but rather a salt water lagoon full of fish, billed as great for snorkeling although we didn't partake. It was more of a jungle than a party scene but nice and quiet.    Our favorite restaurant was U'lu, right on the beach. We loved the open air bar with direct views to the ocean. The food was super fresh and local. I always eat fish in Hawaii but I confess I wish for more indigenous shellfish. No more- if you accept locally farm raised oysters and Maine lobster as indigenous. The wine list is super expensive of course but the best I've seen in Hawaii if your taste runs toward old world as mine does. We liked Beach Tree a lot as well, also open air, but we had a less fortunate evening there with a combination of a warm night with no breeze, a table in the middle of the room, and loud parties all around us. One technical note- While many advocate serving red wine ""at room temperature"" that doesn't apply when the room is 80 degrees F. That was easily and quickly fixed with an ice bucket but still. Also, I looked forward to ""porchetta night"" but it was just OK.    The exercise facility is first rate, the best hotel gym I've seen, probably aided by its status as the facility for the associated condos. They have a lap pool with free aqua classes, lots of cardio machines both inside and outside, and a large room with weights and cable machines. Really nice.    We like to relax in the shade and read books when we visit Hawaii and there were plenty of places for that. One note, the umbrellas at the adult pool are fixed in place so that it's hard to avoid the sun as it moves across the sky.    Another point to keep in mind is that this resort is sprawling. It's a good 10-15 minute walk from King's Pond to Hualali Grille. If you combine maximum 2 story structures with luxurious privacy, the result is a large physical footprint. It's all lovely although it took us a couple days to learn our way around the property. You can always call a bellman for a ride in a golf cart but it's something to consider if you have mobility issues.    One minor but unexpected and really welcome feature of this place is that there are ubiquitous and free self service clothes washers and dryers scattered all through the property, stocked with Tide pods and dryer sheets. Next time we'll bring fewer clothes!    Also, next time I don't think I'll rent a car. We ate on property 5 nights in a row and didn't get bored and it's a little drive to get to other restaurants. I think I'll get airport transfers and just get a car for a day or two if I want to explore.    We had lovely weather in late January- apparently rain is rare. We then hopped over to Poipu in Kauai where we had 3 out of 5 days with heavy rain.    So, in summary, we loved Four Seasons Hualalai. We liked it because it is low key with no hint of the super hip LA crowd we experienced on prior visits to FS Maui and especially FS Oahu. We loved the people who work there. The pools, beach, and restaurants were first rate. We're already planning a return visit.",Feb 2018,January 2018,Traveled as a couple,,"Cincinnati, Ohio"

558751717,50,What a Spectacular Resort!,"This property is incredibly well managed! It shows in the staff and the attention to detail they give to everything. From the moment you arrive, you are completely tended to. The welcoming staff with MaiTais and leis make you feel so special after what is usually a long journey. The rooms are lovely with great linens. Yes, they could do a bit of a refresh on the sleeping room's decor, and I really didn't care for their shampoo, conditioner, or soap. But these are small items compared to the overall feeling of being extremely well taken care of during your stay. The staff helps you with anything you need and are so pleasant about it. We snorkeled in their fish pond (fun), had breakfast room service each morning (always ON TIME!), had cocktails and dinner each night with great ocean views, etc. Our favorite restaurant was The Grill / Steakhouse. (I will write a separate review about that wonderful experience.) Best restaurant of 4 on the property, although we thought all of them were good. I can't say enough about our stay at Hualalai.

There are complimentary snorkels, masks and fins available for use. Our room had a view of the ocean and the salt water pool, and we slept every night with the doors open and just screens and louvers for privacy so we could hear the ocean. I have to say I was in love with the private outdoor shower which included orchids and lush foliage growing in it and a rain shower shower head. The service was impeccable.

558143099,50,Outstanding resort,"This resort proves again that Four Seasons is just in a class by itself. The property is beautiful, and the service is excellent. We had an ocean front room by the Palm Grove pool, which felt a bit more private than other parts of the resort, totally peaceful with an excellent view. We played the golf course right after the Mitsubishi Electric tournament had finished, and it was just in phenomenal condition. Fantastic layout with some challenging holes and great views.    All the staff at the resort are extremely friendly and helpful. We tried all the restaurants, all really good with a few outstanding dishes, but I still think they could up their game just a bit with the dinner menus. The breakfast buffet was outstanding. Plus a great variety of drink and food offerings at all the resort pools.    We did have a problem with one of the tour operators on an excursion we signed up for, and after reviewing this with the Concierge Manager Chenin, she negotiated a fair resolution with the tour company. Many thanks to her for resolving this for us.    About the only other improvement I can think of for this resort is a greater variety of pillow offerings. The pillows sleep a bit flat, and the only thicker ones they had were the heavy buckwheat pillows common in Japan. But this is one really minor nit to pick...    The resort itself is just laid out so well, beautifully landscaped, and perfectly maintained. Truly a peaceful and relaxing beach resort getaway.

One of my favorite features is the Kings Pond which allows visitors the opportunity to snorkel with thousands of beautiful exotic fish. The staff are very knowledgeable. We also fined at all three restaurants which were excellent! My only complaint and reason for not giving a five star review is that we had terrible service in the Ulu restaurant one night at dinner, not sure if the server was new or just overwhelmed but all in all the staff at this hotel goes over and above.

557175634,30,Needs Updating,"We stayed for 6 nights, booked an oceanfront room but were upgraded to a large one bedroom suite. The property has a lovely location and every amenity/activity imaginable, I can see why it makes a great family destination. But the rooms, in particular, are in need of updating and the overall experience, while good, is not up the Four Seasons' standards. Not only was our room very dated and a bit worn but it smelled strongly of cigarette smoke (when we called reception to see what could be done we were told it was a non-smoking hotel! Well, yes, but.....) On the plus side, the fitness faculties (especially the dedicated lap pool) were excellent; combined with the tennis and golf you can be very active here. The food/wine was very good for resort food (a major qualifier!). Aside from our experience with reception, the service was solid (housekeeping, restaurant, valets and fitness staff). Finally, part of our visit overlapped with a PGA event for which the hotel closed one of the three main restaurants for the duration and another restaurant/pool at certain times; also there was wedding one night with outdoor amplified music that kept us up -- it's disappointing that these events were allowed to impact other guests so much.    Overall, this property is not up to Four Seasons standards and it's certainly no great value (~$2,000/night for oceanfront room) but it may be the best option on the Big Island all the same. We also stayed at the Four Seasons Lanai on this trip which was excellent and on par with the Four Season brand ""promise"".",Jan 2018,January 2018,,,"Santa Barbara, California"

Not to mention the Jack Nicklaus golf course that is challenging yet playable and a huge tennis facility with activities all day long. Our room was great with a view of the 18th green as well as the ocean beyond. The touches are amazing including Four Seasons glasses cleaners left by our housekeeping team underneath sunglasses left on the table.    One example...we had one cool day (74 degrees!) so the staff put out hot chocolate in the lobby for their guests...and they did it Four Seasons style with fresh whipped cream, chocolate shavings and marshmallows.

556870556,50,The PERFECT retreat...look no further,"As I recall this incredible vacation my whole body fills with warmth and happiness. We loved the Four Seasons brand and have always enjoyed every property, but this one surpasses all that we’ve experienced so far. I loved it so much i really want to return. Allow me to begin with the healing lava you are surrounded with on the island of Hawaii. The relaxing beach with our turtle 🐢 friends swimming freely beside you if you choose! The Luau right on property is a must! A beautiful entertaining, delicious and Educational experience for all! Now the outdoor shower in our room was the greatest every day. The spa experience was superb. Try one of the scrubs. My skin was never so soft in all my 56 years. The food in all the restaurants on property was amazing and yet different. Leave it to Four Seasons and the manager to have a Hawaiian 🌺 light the torches at dusk blowing the horn and children jump from their seats with parents following him. Live music all over the property serenading you. Dance if you wish, enjoy the sunset, the warm breeze, the children playing right in front of you safely as you enjoy a cocktail 🍹. The famous golf course is impeccable and get out there. Sid is sure to find you with a homemade health bar and drink or perfect apple 🍎 to keep you going all day. We also visited an incredible coffee farm nearby called Hula Daddy’s. Rented a car that was delivered to us on property for the day. Fun experience and am drinking the Kona coffee at home daily now. The most delicious was purchased at the restaurant Ulu on site. There is nothing forgotten when building this property. My husband can’t walk long distances. We had the ideal room near the 🌊 ocean, pool, and food. If we needed to go further, the property arranged us a little golf cart ride to wherever we needed. There’s a gym of course and tennis courts with pros. We truly enjoyed the personalized peaceful seaside service by Alissa. Seeing Alissa every day was truly the icing on the cake, as she was what the Four Seasons brand is all about. Home away from home.

The staff is incredibly welcoming! We booked their luau for our farewell night and it was so much better and classier that the ones in Kona centre. It is more expensive, but well worth it, the food is glorious and well presented, the ahi poke and kalua pig were the best we ever had (and we were staying on the Island for 1 month) and the coctails just great as well. The dancers were from the most reputed company on the island, Island Breeze, the tables elegantly appointed on a slight slope around the scene, so every table had a great view guaranteed.

Our room overlooked the Palm Grove and we had breakfast on our balcony every morning and saw whales jumping in the distance. The food at the Beach Tree restaurant was our favorite (the Greek salad and the Marscapone we became addicted to).    The resort has multiple pools, including a pond with an eagle ray and tons of rather large fish. The resort provides snorkel gear to use at the pond and in the ocean. You can also feed Kainalu the ray during the week via a sign up sheet.    Our favorite part was watching the incredible sunsets on the beach right in front of our room.

The good:  The resort itself and the facilities are excellent and it is set in a beautiful location. Staff are unfailingly friendly and mostly provide a great service.    Good choice of pools or beachfront locations to lounge during the day.    The not so good:    The price to value ratio is becoming questionable.    Rooms are feeling very dated and are dark and a bit gloomy. Towels in rooms were threadbare and we had holes in the sheets.    Not four seasons standard and damaging to their brand. Not worth the almost $2,000 a night for a regular room    Food at the restaurants is inconsistent. Beach Tree is our favorite but had several off dishes. Ordered the half chicken three times and twice it was great and once dry and horrible. A friend on another table said she sent her chicken back on the same evening. Similar issues with one of the pasta dishes - twice great and one time terrible.    Ate at the Grill only once and didn’t like it. Half of our table were served and then the server accidentally threw the rest of our food at us and on the floor. He was quite apologetic but the rest of us had to wait for 15 minutes for our food by which time everyone else had finished. No apology from the management or offer of some compensation for our inconvenience.    A recent New York Times article castigated the resort as “mean and stingy”. Their review was spot on. After staying for 2 weeks over the festive period for 10 years our welcome amenity was a bottle of water. This despite my partner being a so called Four Seasons ‘Elite Guest’. In this respect the resort compares very very badly with other hotels where we are regular guests.    We understand there are plans to re-model the rooms. This would be very welcome.

I understand it's a humid, tropical climate, but the rooms are dated, and have that sticky feel to them... I get the impression that many people who come here are largely U.S. ""brand fanatics"" of Four Seasons in the States who have never set foot in a 5 star hotel in Switzerland, Paris, or even London. There is a resulting upward ratings bias, in my opinion.    As a luxury family excursion destination, with kids, I would recommend this property highly; once you're there, there is no need to leave the grounds and plenty to do and eating options for all ages...

Lots to do and very helpful staff.    Rooms are very comfortable with great views of the ocean.    Unfortunately the food is so mediocre it brings the whole resort down.

Not huge but definitely a very solid spread of fruits and pastries and omelette station and yogurts. Good quality food there and no complaints. Lunch and dinner are so lackluster it's perplexing.    The first night we went to Ulu sushi bar and were served dry bread and a hummus type spread (really weird for a sushi restaurant and just not that tasty). I then ordered ahi poke with some oils, onions and other flavors on top. I finished only half. Was not that tasty and a little fishy. I've never left ahi on my plate before. It was just not appetizing. For mains I ordered some local Hawaiian fish in a miso type broth. Fish was overcooked and the broth was just not flavorful at all. Really bland.    The resort undersalts everything, so everything lacks flavor and is bland. For lunch we had an assortment of pizzas, salads and burgers. All just average. Fries were under salted and overcooked one day. So much oil. Salads were boring and dressings lacked flavor. I mean, the food was just boring, not great execution or flavoring and the menu is very heavily gluten/pasta oriented. Not enough variety and just disappointing, regardless of price. And the fact that all these items cost $20++ makes it even harder to justify.    If the resort overhauled its dining, I'd probably have given 5 stars no hesitation.",Dec 2017,December 2017,,,"New York City, New York"

We enjoyed golf, spa treatments, quiet pools, beachfront bathing, shopping, dinners by the water, and spectacular sunrises and sunsets over gorgeous palm trees.

This is a place to relax. Dinner reservations end at 9pm and it is 15 minutes to anything off the property (Uber and taxis are very convenient). We loved Ulu restaurant!! The coconut soup with chicken and cilantro.....one of the best soups I’ve ever had in my lifetime!! Sooooo flavorful!! Floyd our amazing waiter at Ulu made our dining experience so lovely. Thank you Floyd!! You are awesome!! He spoke with the chef who made it possible for me to enjoy the soup again through room service (was not on the room service menu). Above and beyond!! I was so impressed!! There is an adult only (Yay!!) infinity pool with a swim up bar. That was fabulous as well. The rooms are beautiful. They reminded me of casitas in Scottsdale - very cozy and private. Their King’s Pond boasts 4,000 fish from 75 species in a safe educational marine environment.

546721589,50,Visitor suggestions for a beautiful property,My wife and I just spent a week at Four Seasons Hualalai. Without being repetitive with the other reviews here are a couple suggestions we came up with for people visiting the property.    1. We booked an oceanfront room but it doesn’t seem much different than an ocean view room. Save your money and book a lesser room. In some cases you’ll be upgraded to a better room anyways.    2. Eat at the Residents Beach Club for lunch or dinner. We enjoyed the meals there over anywhere else including Ulu.    3. Hualalai Grill was very good for steak but check out their wine list ahead of time as they don’t have a sommelier.    Aloha,Dec 2017,December 2017,Traveled as a couple,,"Highlands Ranch, Colorado"

Food is amazing, beach is immaculate and has long trails you can walk, either on the beach front or paved roads. Tons of adorable turtles along the beach (don’t touch them! They just want to chill) and top notch service. I was blown away from the second we checked in, to the view from our room on the 18th hole (if you like golf GO HERE) to the awesome hourly refreshers while lounging at the pool. This place is crazy expensive but if you’ve got the money don’t even look at another property in the area. There’s even a fresh water pool you can snorkel in with literally everything that flows from the ocean...awesome fish, sting rays etc. It is stunning and a dream for anyone who loves to swim with the fishies :).

We also had the privilege of visiting (or dinners mostly) and none really compare to the Four Seasons. Is it worth the premium - for us it absolutely was but not for everyone.

With the Four Seasons, you certainly get what you pay for. Service is outstanding from the opening sit down greeting session (some refer to this as check-in) to your car’s all packed, you really won’t have to think too much. It’s an easy trip from the airport, (hang a left, travel north a few miles and take another left), and you are on the dry side of the island amongst the old lava fields, right where you want to be on the big island. You know its an outstanding resort for relaxation, as even the turtles are known to rest on their magnificent beach. Don’t worry about the red flags, their just paranoid. Waves aren’t any worse than on a typical yellow alert day on the outer banks (if you are an east coaster.) Breakfast was especially noteworthy. We ate on the property most evenings and the food is fabulous. Our bungalow overlooked the adult pool and it could not have been any better. Great nights sleep. Don’t forget to rent a car. My wife and I trekked out to see the lava in the evening. Although it required a 4 mile (easy) bicycle ride and an 1 ½ hour hike over the black lava rock at night, it was unbelievable being able to walk right up to the lava.

First the pros. The staff is marvelous, helpful, friendly, attentive, everything you would need from a staff member. Concierge service is amazing, This has not changed at all.    What has? minor things, like no more fresh squeezed orange juice, no more L'Occitane bath items, just quart size black container of shampoo, hand wash etc., no more pumic stone, bath brush....    Coffee machine (Illy) in the suite does not work. Does not take a scientist to figure out how one works and I am a scientist. Meaning, it's a dud.    There are truly minor things and I wouldn't write a review just to mention them, but what really got to me is the reservation policy for restaurants on site.    Once you make a reservation you have to cancel 72 hours plus earlier, otherwise there is a penalty. I guess if you're paying $1500 or so (sic!) for a suite $50 is nothing, but to me its the principle. 72 hours!  The other thing is self-parking, Free, otherwise $25 a night for valet parking but the problem is there are very few, maybe 20 or so slots not marked ""for valet purposes only"". The unmarked ones are full of what looks like employee vehicles.    Finally, room service. The ladies are very pleasant and do a very good job but they come in after 2 pm.

This was of such importance that if our group had realized that this could have been an issue we would have chosen a different resort. Two double beds was not what we had in mind. The rooms were booked one year in advance. We were ultimately given a room with a King, after my husband worked with staff for 1.5 hrs upon arrival. That's a difficult start for a week at The Four Seasons. He walked away with the room, however, the frustration of that 1.5 hours stuck with the trip. Many of the people traveling with us went through the same ordeal and some received the King room others did not. The ordeal was met by almost all. The service at the pool was awesome. Wenonah (not sure on spelling) was fantastic. The resort was beautiful and clean, the people in charge of the beach and pool chairs were always great. I was disappointed to find that there wasn't any recycling in the rooms and lobby and that there wasn't a fresh filtered water option in the lobby to reduce use of plastic bottles for those traveling with water bottles.

The rooms are well appointed, nice bathroom, tub, large shower, with standard amenities. Comfortable beds, evening turn down service. We ate in all of the restaurants and the food was delicious and the service was excellent. Expensive but you expect that in this type of property. We stayed four nights and got off to a bad start because as we arrived, one big group was leaving and another one was arriving. We were shown to our room and we weren't happy about the location, right next to the pro shop. We could hear them bringing out carts and golfers getting ready in the early morning. We asked at the front desk to be moved and the manager basically shrugged her shoulders and said there was nothing they could do as they were full with the president's club for a large group. As the days went on, it felt like the resort was catering more to the big group than to individual guests. On two occasions I tried to get lounge chairs at the adult pool and none were available due to an event the group was holding at that location. I was told I could be put on a waiting list.... not acceptable for a Four Seasons. On our last night we received a call saying that could put us in a different room, which we declined, too much trouble for one night and we were leaving early the next morning. I would say this is more of a family resort than couple's get away. There were a lot of kids and we listened to some crying babies each morning at breakfast and kids running around the restaurant. We were invited to a manager's reception showcasing the new Four Seasons helicopter, which we really enjoyed.

The accommodations we had were very comfortable. The service was friendly and generally good. The food in the restaurants was very good. The staff were all very pleasant. So why only 3 stars? This resort is reputed to be one of Hawaii’s very best, and thus our expectations were extremely high. And because this resort is terribly expensive (think $29 martinis and extrapolate from there), we were less forgiving when service was less than perfect...and it very often was. There were many significant lapses in service which should not occur at a resort like this. Furthermore, at a hotel such as this, we expected the fine dining restaurant, the Ulu Ocean Grill to be far more upscale. It is nice, but other deluxe hotels in Hawaii, the Four Seasons Maui or the Halekulani in Honolulu for example, have restaurants that are much more special. In summary, we have stayed at many fine hotels, and this property clearly fell short of what a five star property should be...and with the extremely high cost, it is a very poor value and in our opinion is certainly not worth the price.",Nov 2017,October 2017,Traveled as a couple,,"Irvine, California"

We were escorted to our ground level room and was given a thorough explanation of everything. The outdoor shower was our favorite and we used it every single night. The body wash, shower gel, and conditioner were top notch and exactly what you would expect at this type of resort. Bottles of water were always left for us after maid service. The small fridge came in handy because they have a general store on site where you can buy different types of drinks and food items. The grounds of the resort are beautiful and it's a treat just to walk around. The ambience of the tiki torches at night make it all the better. For those of you that like longer walks, there is a path that leads from the resort to the beach where the ocean activities are located. It's about a 30 minute walk with incredible views of the ocean and lava rock. Once you get past the Residence Beach House restaurant, just keep on walking. We did this once when we took advantage of the outrigger canoeing. This was incredible and something everyone should try. Prices were reasonable, especially when splitting the costs with another couple. They even drove us back to the resort in a golf cart. Exceptional service from the activities group. This is where the best beach is. Service in the Beach Tree Restaurant was best at night. During the day, it was island time. No worries, just plan accordingly. Food was okay. Overpriced for the quality. A lot of the dishes seemed to be overcooked. Perhaps the grill was set too high. No worries though. We didn't come in expecting the food to be spectacular. Pools were immaculate and beach service was beyond exceptional. Workout rooms were amazing and well supplied. Basketball court and tennis courts were well maintained. We had to use the showers on our final day because of a late night flight. Again, service and facilities were exceptional. One day, we rented a car to see the rest of the island. If only every car rental could go this smoothly. Told us what time to be in the lobby and voila, our car was ready. No long forms to fill out. Gave us a great car for the day. Couldn't have gone smoother. The concierge was also helpful in pointing out some cool spots to see around the island (black sand beach on the northern tip of the island). Another really cool thing that the resort has is King's Pond. Several types of fish and a stingray call it home. You can snorkel as long as you want, all within the safe confines of the pond. Other than the quality of the food, I would say the bed (at least in our room) needs updating. Mattress was saggy in spots. Overall, it was still the best resort I've ever stayed at and would recommend it in a heartbeat to others.",Nov 2017,November 2017,Traveled on business,Choose a ground floor room with an outdoor shower.

We took advantage of the 21+ pool bar, snuba'ing in the King's pond, our personal lava tube shower, swimming at 2 am in the 24 hours pools/hot tubs, and sleeping on comfy cabana chairs in front of the gorgeous ocean waves. We ate dinner at Ulu on the ocean where they had a floodlight so you could watch the ocean waves even in the dark. The service was top notch and the views beautiful.

We had been told Four Seasons Hualalai was best of best. We were disappointed. It is a beautiful locale, but the property is decidedly ordinary - property, grounds, architecture, rooms, public areas - for what was billed as a top of the line luxury experience. Our room was dank and dreary, badly in need of a refurbishment, service was good but not Four Seasons excellent, there was nothing special about this resort.

One restaurant was not open until the middle of our stay, and the swim-up pool which is the only pool that is not a quiet pool was unavailable until the middle of the week as well. There were a lot of good people who served you, but the other concierges and some of the other people behind the desk were ridiculous. We are not all snobs who have money. Our family is very diverse, and we are very proud of that. The front desk staff were nothing like the waiters and room service staff who served us.

539221634,50,"Second Visit, Many More To Come!","My husband and I recently celebrated our five year wedding anniversary at the Four Seasons Hualalai after having spent the first week of our honeymoon there. Below is a brief summary of our experience during our second stay:    - Location, location, location - The resort sits on the site where the Hualalai lava flow meets the ocean; a landscape truly like no other. While the beach is somewhat limited by the rocky landscape, it provides some fairly spectacular (almost other-worldly) scenery. The property itself is magical - it reminds you of some exotic fantasy locale where the air itself smells of hibiscus and citrus. I was prepared for a bit of a let down when we returned as I had convinced myself that there was no way this resort was as wonderful as I remembered, but it is in fact sooooooo much better! For travelers looking for a bit of adventure; follow the highway to it's furthest point north until you come to Pololu Valley. Climb down the bluff (a very steep 3/4 mile hike - NOT for those looking for a leisurely stroll!!) and make your way onto the most incredible black beach you've ever seen. The sand is powder fine, the water crystal clear and just slightly chilly and the scenery is indescribable. The trip back up the valley will make you question your life decisions, but trust me...it is worth it!    - The liquid component - Hualalai offers something for everyone when it comes to options for a swim. Although you have to mind the lava rock a bit, there are a few well manicured beaches on property that are lovely. The pool game is on point - ranging from the Seashell (geared toward families), Beach Tree (the ""serenity"" pool) to the Palm Grove (adults only with an in-pool bar). Each has several stations set up with a rotating selection of fresh fruit flavored water, along with high quality sunscreen and leave-in hair conditioner. Kings Pond is the resort's own private lagoon, stocked with a wide array of aquatic life for the snorkeling enjoyment of guests. Comfortable loungers and cabanas are plentiful, and, in true Four Season's fashion, attendants come around to clean your sunglasses, hand out fresh fruit skewers or tempt you with a full menu of poolside food/beverages. Fabulous.    - Your own slice - The rooms at Hualalai were built to blend seamlessly into the surrounding landscape. Two story bungalows are situated in crescents around the pools, all facing the ocean. For the sake of full disclosure I will mention that the rooms are beginning to show their age a bit, but they are spacious, clean, comfortable, private and very Hawaiian. Kimono-style robes are provided for guests, which are almost stylish enough to throw on a few accessories and wear out for the evening! Seriously - I almost did it. The resort also provides complimentary laundry facilities around the property, which we found come in quite handy if you are staying more than a few days.    - Eat, drink and be merry - We tried several dining and drink options on property during our stay, including room service, the breakfast buffet at Ulu daily, Beach Tree Bar as well as food/drink service at both the Beach Tree and Palm Grove pools. All were delicious and high quality (though perhaps a tad overpriced), but the Beach Tree Bar in particular continues to be our all time favorite place to eat and drink. Like...best EVER. Whether you are grabbing a quick afternoon lunch at the bar while listening to the waves crash just a few meters away, or have staked out a few comfy chairs on the patio for an evening meal and several rounds of drinks to watch the sun set, you will be wowed by the thoughtfulness and attention to detail put into every sip or bite. So yes, you will pay Four Seasons prices for meals and drinks here...but c'mon, that's to be expected, right!? Do yourself a favor - stuff your face, wash it down with a well crafted Mai Tai (or three) and enjoy. Cheers!    - Claim to fame - Lets talk about what reeeeeeeally makes this resort special: the legendary Four Seasons service! And it is on full display here, my friends. Upon arrival, my husband and I were upgraded to a prime ocean view room in the Kings Pond crescent - just a few doors down from the room in which we spent our Honeymoon. The resort had record of our previous stay on file (from five years prior), and made a point to recreate our honeymoon trip as closely as possible. A lovely bottle of fairly expensive Champagne, several ""welcome"" treats and a personal note from the property manager awaited us in our room. From that point on, the level of service remained consistently high across the property. We were greeted by name by the resort staff, with several wait staff/bartenders remembering our favorites and making suggestions of other things that we might enjoy. Mahalo, FS Hualalai...we felt the love!    Here's the moral of the story: go here, stay as long as you can, spend a ton of money and don't regret a dime.

Took advantage of the beach as well as snorkeling with the prescription mask available (thank you!). Tasty dinner and breakfast and appreciated the ability to ask for half portions for lighter appetites. We truly felt we could ask for anything we needed.

539168515,50,Amazing 20th aniversary celebration in paradise,"We have stayed at several Four Seasons resorts before and this one is over the top. The architecture, décor, and landscaping have preserved the flavor of an elegant Hawaian resort. We were upgraded to a deluxe suite (which was HUGE) and though we did not have the ocean views we had hoped for, the private outdoor shower with orchids and tropical plants made up for it. The different room categories are somewhat confusing when booking, an ocean view room is on the first floor and views are sometimes obstructed by landscaping, beach chairs, umbrellas, and palapas. Prime ocean view rooms are all on the second floor and guarantee a better look at the ocean, the best views are from the ocean front rooms.The front desk and concierge staff were really friendly and helpful, we were greeted with rum punch, cool towels and paperwork already done so we could check right in.

Our oceanfront room was basically 20 yards from the beach with breathtaking views of the Pacific Ocean. The staff is friendly and engaging and always willing to please to make your stay very special. The concierge was extremely helpful when making the right reservations for Island excursions as well as transportation options for our stay.    Can’t say enough about the top rated restaurants you have to choose from as well as the quality of the spa.

Incredible views of the Hawaii coast and the Pacific Ocean from all over the resort. We stayed in Palm Grove and were just steps out the back lanai to the adults only infinity pool and the ocean.

537265333,50,Incredible Location and Food,"We stayed at the Four Seasons for 5 days and had a lovely time. The setting, the food, friendly staff and activities were superb. For a resort of this caliber, it is hard not to give a top rating; however, a couple of items could have been better. The room was dark with two lamps that did not light the entire room, there were no outlets next to the beds so a long charging cord was necessary and there were no usb charging stations available. In fairness, it could have been just our room but it seems like those things should be standard. The snorkeling pool had short hours closing at 4 which seemed limited. The prices in the restaurants were very expensive. The concierge staff, Iwalana and Suzanne, were incredible and helped us think through options for activities. One of the concierge staff, however, gave us information that was not helpful. For example, we asked about the best way to see the lava from the volcano and she said that the helicopter ride was the only way to do this (at $550/pp). We later found out from a local that the best lava viewing is by boat. And boy were they right. The lava viewing tour by boat was half the price and took us right up the flow. It was the most incredible experience. So glad we did not give into the pressure to book a helicopter for this specific request.

537221247,20,Hualalai is tired and needs cap ex. Go elsewhere,"My family and I stayed at the Hualalai last week. In short, we were quite disappointed in our stay. We felt that there was very little value especially given the $2000 per night price tag. The rooms are very tired and have not been updated. The furniture is chipped and damaged. It appears to be a decade old. Further, the Hotel seemed unsder staffed and uncared for. For example, the windows on our suite were dirty with bird poop that was not cleaned during the entirety of our trip. Stairs were unpainted. Pool furniture was mismatched. Even the soft serve ice cream machine at the kids pool was broken. There were waits in the restaurant (and we were off season). The food quality was around Marriott level. For example, they serve Chobani yogurt at breakfast (with no organic option). Hotel recently sold and apparently the new owner is not investing it yet charging full price.

My husband and I arrived ate in the evening. It was beautiful with the glow of the low lighting the the torches. We were received in a nice lobby and offered a Maui tai and hot hand towel to freshen ourselves from the long journey. We were brought to our Ocean front room and it was spectacular. You couldn't get closer unless you were on the water. The rooms are very roomy and nicely appointed. We had an outdoor lava shower (only available in bottom rooms). The doors to the lanai opens up to an outdoor lounging area overlooking the ocean. We were left little surprises everyday, a bottle of champagne, chocolate covered strawberries, chocolate turtle candies, cloth to clean glasses...) it was a nice touch.  The resort is absolutely amazing with breath taking views everywhere. There are several restaurants on the resort. I highly recommend staying on resort and dining at any of them. We were very pleased with all the food we had and we consider ourselves foodies. One of our favorites was the Wednesday night Pork Special at the Beachtree. We smelled it cooking in an outdoor pit all day while hanging poolside. We also really enjoyed our meal at the Residents Beach House. Don't miss the Maui Tai from LG while you are there. It's a special recipe. We dined on the lemongrass prawns with fried rice. Delicious! Don't miss the Lobster tails in a Thai basil butter at ULU Ocean grill. We paired it with a sake flight and enjoyed all the flavors together.  This resort has so many things to do you really don't have to leave the resort unless you plan to do an adventure such as the Lava and waterfall helicopter ride. Concierge is real good at assisting you with any of your adventure request. You are able to rent a car right from the concierge if you so desire.  Do not miss the spa!! We scheduled a spa day. The couples lomi lomi massage was incredible. We were brought out to a relaxing garden while we waited. We then were brought through as plush garden to a cabana for us. It was so relaxing and we really enjoyed this massage technique.  We really enjoyed all the pools. There are several to choose from. As we are empty nesters and on our honeymoon we opted for the quiet/adult pool most of the time. The pass around cool and refreshing adult treats a few times a day (vodka passion fruit Popsicle, rum soaked pineapple...) The ocean pool was really nice and we even were able to swim with a sea turtle that was in it with us. The King's pond pool is were you can snorkel. I suggest going early during the day for best visibility, but we enjoyed it late afternoon too.  We did not play golf this time but will on our next visit here. We will definitely be back!!!

They started our stay with a welcome kit that involved mango with rum for adults and juice for the kids (best thing ever). The staff went long ways to personalize our experience: wrote the names or our kids on the tab with non-toxic crayons, even provided tiny motorized whale as a present for them. This is equivalent to saying to a 1.5 and 3.5 year-old: ""bathing is going to be fun while you are here"". Brilliant. The whole resort mentality is check-in and just enjoy. We will take care of everything for you. No need to carry your wallet, question what is free. Most services are free e.g. towels, beach seats, access to pool, toys/diapers for kids, water and sunscreen. The things that do require payment, e.g. drinks, food, you can handle by just giving them your room number. They 've thought of the most crazy details. There was a person going around the pool / beach area and offering to clean your glasses if they are dirty/wet from the water. Who does that? Most chill, relaxing, experience ever.    Note that we were there with 2 kids. They essentially have a daycare in the resort and also nanny services. We tried the nanny service 3 days and we were blown away every time.

The resort provided snorkeling equipment and my wife and I snorkeled daily. We loved the turtles, fish and the manorays. The restaurants were great but expensive. I just don't understand why anyone would charge so much for breakfast. A couple eggs, coffee, toast, fruit, bacon... that shouldn't be 50 bucks. So most days we took advantage of the complimentary coffee and ate in our room for breakfast and lunch, we just used the restaurants for the most part for dinner.

533233897,50,Exceptional in every way!,"Stayed 10 nights during Ironman World Championships. Have been coming for the past 16 years to Kailua Kona but have visited all the islands as part of my stays. This Resort is exceptional in all categories. The overwhelming positive reviews are for good reason. Tip: book with American Express Platinum travel and you get breakfast included each day, early checkin, late checkout, $200 credit to the room, and complimentary room upgrade! Well worth it! I followed Travel Advisor notices on room rates for several months and booked at a great rate. Then, the rate dropped again via notice by Travel Advisor and I rebooked the stay w American Express Travel concierge saving an additional 100/ night. Upon checkin the upgrade was not available due to Chef Fest and full capacity but the second day we were upgraded to a great ocean view room located in the center of the complex, room 2110... great view on second floor overlooking Beechtree pool and ocean, easy access to dining, Lobby, Spa/Fitness Center, and primary pools. The spa fitness center is top notch w a thorough variety of fitness spa options. The breakfast at Ulu grill is very nice; however, note that gratuity and taxes are not covered by Amex benefits described above. The food typically is expensive but I knew many places to enjoy meals in Kailua Kona as well as in Waikoloa north. The trading company at Resort also has reasonable options for breakfast or lunch along w full coffee bar, smoothies, etc. There is also gasoline available at the Trading Company to fill up rental car before returning to airport just a few minutes South of Resort. Enjoyed mornings sitting on lanai sipping coffee available in the room while watching the great view, people and native birds.

There are a few beach areas to choose from, and there is complimentary snorkel gear. There is so much to gush about I am losing track!

I was a little hesitant when first booking in that I don't like the feeling of people overstepping and providing service because they are expected to (the standard but phony response ""My Pleasure""). However, service here far exceeded expectations. From fresh fruit offering in beach chair to unobtrusive but always present service staff providing fresh cups of ice water to courtesy rum popsicle treats in afternoon....fantastic from the start. It felt like all staff genuinely wanted to make the guest experience exceedingly enjoyable. Property is superb, great sunsets with views from Ulu and Beach Tree restaurant (Residents was closed for remodeling); Beach Tree for live music background while watching sunsets, and Ulu for sunset viewing and great food. Lunch menu from golf course restaurant could use more options than just burgers but minor minor point. Courtesy snorkeling on property in ocean a recommendation as well...very convenient (didn't do the snorkeling in the pond provided).

531527200,50,Exceptional service and hospitality,"Hello,  We had a wonderful experience with the concierge service while planning for nanny services for my daughter. The nanny was just as I’d hoped, friendly, energetic, creative and knowledgeable about the resort. My daughter wanted to bring her back to the main land with us!  We were very happy with the Resort and thought that the architecture and design of the buildings blended nicely with the gorgeous surroundings without detracting from their beauty. We were able to enjoy Hualalai while combined with unparalleled luxury from the Four Seasons. My morning jogs past the golf course and through the lava fields will stay with me for a very long time as an example of breathtaking views, weather, sun and waves!  If I could change one thing about our visit it would be to add a few more items to the children’s menues in your restaurants or even offer a slightly bigger portion. My 6-year old daughter enjoyed the meals but was frequently asking for more of the offered item to satisfy her hunger. An example is the French Toast breakfast at Ulu. She simply looked at the two pieces of toast then looked at me and said “well, I’m going to need more than this!” I agreed with her on many occasions we visited your restaurants. Of course, I can’t discount the effects of good weather and outdoor fun as well as the quality of food on her little belly!  That said, I can’t enumerate the many splendid things we enjoyed at your Resort.

Everything is up to date in the rooms and I loved the gym part (don't ask me about the spa, I am clueless for about that), the perfectly clean...well everything.

529481939,30,Meh,"We were, well, very disappointed in our recent stay here. We had just come from five nights at Four Seasons Lanai (where we had not a single complaint) and by the end of our first night here we were truly tempted to leave.    It was our honeymoon, and we had booked the Ocean Front Room. The most expensive, top room (not suite) that you can book. ""Ocean Front"" is an affront to that term. We had a view of the pool, and a partial view at best of the ocean. We were on the lower level of two, so perhaps the second level would have offered a better view and more privacy. I have never stayed in a property that calls ocean front anything like this. There was no privacy. We walked out to our small lanai only to face the adult pool where there were constantly people making noise. To the left we could see the walkways, lots of chairs, and slightly the ocean. People walking by all the time. From our bathroom, if we left the doors open we could see people and the pool. This is NOT the private, romantic, experience that ""ocean front"" would imply, or that this caliber of resort seems to indicate. The outdoor shower was very cool; we enjoyed using that, AFTER we closed all of the doors for privacy to the outside. The room was our first major disappointment.    The pools/seating, while pretty, feel more like a cruise or Sandals resort. It is just loaded up with seats, one right next to another. Instead of feeling special, you feel like a sardine being packed in to the space. There is no space to move a seat around if you like to face the sun straight on, or just to get any sense of being on your own. While it is true that we never could NOT find a seat, we regularly couldn't find a seat that gave us any sense of romantic, quiet, semi-private time.    The food was fine. Our favorite was definitely Beach Tree; great, authentic, Italian food (recommend the pizzas and the cacio e pepe pasta!) right on site was a treat. Nice cocktails and wine list, too. Umi was mediocre; we ate here twice and both times had overcooked food, and boring fish (the poke was flavorless). The steak house was also decent, but very expensive for a not totally outstanding meal. Also had a nice cocktail and wine list here, and we enjoyed our meal overall. Great service at the three restaurants.    The spa was nice, though personally I would have preferred a massage in air conditioning and without having to hear guests down the walkway. The steam room, showers, cold plunge pool, and amenities in the spa are very lovely. It's a nice treat that you can use the spa even when you aren't getting a service; we took advantage of this our last day when we had to check out early but didn't have a flight until 8pm. They provide everything you need.    The beaches? Ugh. What a disappointment. My husband is allergic to chlorine/chemicals in pools, so when we travel to an island/beach vacation we really want a BEACH. We spent a lot of time at the Beach Pool, the only stretch of beach that you can actually swim in. There are numerous areas where there are seats set up that face the ocean, but they aren't swimmable. The Beach Pool? It was...okay. Again, seat after seat after seat, no seclusion, sardined in. One day we were next to two teenaged boys who were loudly playing music; perhaps we should have complained to the staff, but it seems to me that the staff should have insisted they turn off the loud music without anyone needing to complain. The water was nice, but the sand and bottom were rocky. Waves that are stopped by the rock wall on the outside of the swimming area make for a pretty calm experience. A turtle (or two) spend time in here; that was neat. It was fine for a dip, but with so many rocks it wasn't a place you wanted to relax in for a long period of time.    Our service at the pools and beach was good and very friendly. They would set us up in seats quickly. They could have come by more frequently for drink/food orders, but other than that we appreciated what they did for us. They offer snorkeling equipment and fun stuff for the kids to play with.    All of the ""luxury"" items are not worth all of the negatives. Sure, it was nice to have my sunglasses cleaned. It was cool to have adult popsicles at the ""quiet"" pool (that was anything but quiet). These ""amenities"" felt like extras that weren't needed and I would have taken them away to have a better room, better beach, quieter trip.    Our favorite pool was definitely the large ""quiet"" pool, though as I stated above it wasn't quiet except for one day. Groups would congregate and drink in the pool, chatting loudly. This isn't exactly offensive, but also not the ""quiet"" experience we were told this location would provide, and makes the time spent there less relaxing as you hear the conversations of the people on every side of you, in every corner, and in the pool. It felt more like a Cancún pool party scene than a luxury hotel pool.    The walk around the resort was beautiful. Nicely maintained walkways, very pretty, lots of wildlife. Plenty of bathrooms around the property. As we walked around our first night, we realized that our complaint with the rooms could not be fixed. The design of the resort is such that there are U shaped areas with the rooms, so all rooms are basically on walkways. Perhaps some of the suites offer more privacy?    Overall, this was a really disappointing end to our honeymoon. No upgrade (they don't upgrade from rooms to suites? Not even for a honeymoon? Not even when the resort isn't full? We were told with our four seasons preferred amenity they do not upgrade outside of the room categories, but the resort itself could have provided one), an ""ocean front"" room that was anything but, offering almost zero privacy, a not great beach experience, too busy, and less awesome food than expected at this caliber of resort.    A previous reviewer complained about kids; while I was not bothered by them, I can absolutely confirm that it was a very kid-friendly resort. There were children running around everywhere, at all hours. I found this much less annoying than the loud party-scene adults. So, fair warning for those looking for a quiet, adult, romantic experience: this resort will not offer that. The Beach Pool (the one spot to swim in the ocean) is right in front of the family pool, so expect it be loud, as well as the snorkeling pool.    The shops on site are nice. Some more expensive than others, but all offering a nice selection for gifts or souvenirs. We enjoyed the Trading Post a lot; great spot to grab a coffee or breakfast sandwich, or a cold bottle of wine to take back to your room for slightly cheaper than room service/restaurant prices.    If you like small, boutique, properties, this isn't the place for you. If you are okay with larger, busier, all-inclusive feeling, resorts, this could be a good pick. Given the reviews, clearly most people are very happy at the Four Seasons Hualalai.    And a final FYI: I definitely recommend you book with a four seasons preferred partner, and if you want to splurge on an excursion, a helicopter tour was an absolutely amazing experience and phenomenal way to see the island!",Oct 2017,September 2017,Traveled as a couple,,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"

I very much enjoyed how the property is laid out - meaning it was not a gross monstrosity like so many Hawaiian resorts. That being said, I was quite surprised by how expensive the food was. I was also shocked by the cost of spa treatments. My largest pet peeve about the resort is that they made the beach area a pool (they made a lava wall protecting it from waves).

At check in we asked if we could upgrade (willing to pay) and was told other rooms would be available in 2 days. We never heard back. The guy who gave us the tour was really nice as he showed us around the resort. We saw him several times throughout the stay and we only got the same greeting ""Aloha""....that was there way of extending the legendary service??? Not one person referred to us by name...has happened at every FS we have stayed at. Not one person personally checked on us to see how they could make the stay magical. Maybe there's just no magic hear beyond the beauty of the resort. Maybe they want the resort to speak for itself??? I wouldn't recommend paying this price point for just mediocre service, especially if you've been blown away by other FS properties. My son said the staff at the golf course were an exceptional team. He had a lesson and played the course which he said was remarkable. He had a Dream Catcher activity and glow in the dark golf that he said was more geared for kids younger than 6...he's 12.

527823266,50,Paradise,"We had the pleasure of being guests at this resort for seven nights at the end of July. The rooms, the grounds, and the staff were all fabulous.    In advance of our trip, we were contacted by the resort concierge team. I have never had such a pleasant experience or such great assistance in making arrangements for a trip. This concierge team made me feel like I had my own personal group of travel agents working to make every detail perfect. They gave me detailed suggestions on excursions and activities both at the resort and around the island. After we decided what things we were interested in doing, they made all of our arrangements for these adventures. They also helped arrange restaurant reservations and vegan accommodations for us during our trip. Upon arrival they gave us a complete itinerary with all the details we needed.    We had a substantial flight delay and therefore arrived much later than expected the first night. The receptionist greeted us with leis and courtesy Mai Tais while we checked in and got acquainted with the resort. They valet parked our Jeep (free self parking is also available), got all of our bags and delivered us and our bags to our room on a large golf cart.    Our room was just beautiful! We selected a Ocean View Prime King Room and we were given a second floor room around the adult-only pool with a beautiful ocean view. We regularly opened the double sliding glass doors and enjoyed the beauty of this scenic view. The room was very spacious with a huge bathroom complete with a double vanity, large tub and stand up shower and private powder room. There was also a walk-in closet and large balcony with chairs and a dining table. We were celebrating an anniversary and a birthday on this trip and the resort recognized this with a beautiful fruit and chocolate plate and bottle of champagne in our room upon arrival.    The grounds of this hotel is a giant garden. They have their own horticulturists on the property. The beauty is breathtaking. They took great care to integrate the buildings and the nature in a very organic way to celebrate the beauty of the island. I really appreciate this.    There are four restaurants on this resort (three beachfront restaurants and one that overlooks the golf course). There are also four pools (three family friendly pools and an adult-only pool). One of the family-friendly pools is filled with fish and allows guests to rent snorkel gear to view the sea life. I would love to see the resort remove/convert this pool. The ocean is a great alternative to see these fish in their natural habitat and I don't think it is necessary to have them contained like this. There is also a spa, golf course, fitness center, cultural center and a few boutiques on the property.    We had breakfast brought to our room each morning and dined on the balcony. The room service staff was wonderful and very willing to accommodate our vegan diet. All of the in room service was great, but we had Jon a couple of mornings and he was very personable and we enjoyed his service very much. We tried each of the restaurants on the property over the course of the week. Our favorite was 'ULU Ocean Grill. The ambiance, service and food surpassed the rest. They provided us with a nice vegan menu and even made us a special vegan dessert. We enjoyed live acoustic music while we dined. The other restaurants could benefit from a more comprehensive vegan menu.    The service at the adult-pool and ocean area was lovely. Noah, Mayson, Christian and Ashley were very friendly and helpful. They have a swim up bar that serves wonderful cocktails.    For excursions, one day we drove up to Hawi and shopped and had lunch. After lunch we drove up to Pololū Valley Lookout, which is spectacular. We hiked down Pololū Trail to the black sand beach below. It was definitely worth the hike. This part of the big island was so beautiful. Another day we took a morning helicopter Paradise Helicopter. This was a highlight of our trip. There is truly no better way to see the island. We saw several active volcano sites including seeing lava flow into the ocean. We also saw the beautiful coastlines and many waterfalls. We tried to surf a couple days as well, but the waves were not good so we opted for some paddle boarding and ocean snorkeling which was fun.    Our stay at Four Seasons Hualalai was wonderful from start to finish.

Great quality but sometimes it can be tricky to order when you're wheat/grain free and dairy free like we are. More Paleo/Bulletproof options would only add to the allure of this property. 4. Gorgeous pools. Again, authentic old Hawaii vibe. 5. The staff was superb. They really take the time to get to know you and cater to what they know you like which is super appreciated and noticed, especially at this price point. 6. Bottom line, this place is special.

This was the first vacation that when I left I actually and honestly felt refreshed and peaceful and not the least bit aggravated about anything. FIRST TIME EVER! No joke. 7.

From the moment of arrival when they give you a lai and a cocktail, you feel like the most valued guest on the property. We were invited to a small cocktail reception the first night and met the property manager, who was lovely.    The rooms were insane, the property amenities were outstanding....they thought of everything. We went from here to the Ritz in Maui and it made that location feel like a dump!! It was that nice! Never wanted to leave and cannot wait to return.",Sep 2017,October 2016,Traveled as a couple,,"Norwalk, Connecticut"
526506040,30,Paradise- LOST,"This was our 10th visit to Hualalai Four Seasons. The design and marketing has always been to adult relaxation and beautiful surroundings and adult pleasures to the max. This was never a DISNEY LAND type property but it is becoming one. So very DISAPPOINTED to experience their gradual yet complete focus on families. Every venue has been permeated by kids and their endulging parents and Four Seasons staff who look the other way as other travelers are affected by and must endure bad behaviour. I hardly think that sensual, up lite outdoor showers in the room planted with tropical plants and orchids are meant to be for the kids. I hardly think the wonderful menus in all the the upscale ($$$$$) property choices are meant for kids. I hardly think the Jack Nicklaus gold course is meant for kids to tear it up while charging golfers premium fees. I hardly think that wonderful spa/fitness area and outside spa garden was designed with kids in mind. This is all about the selfish parents that want to enjoy this venue at the expense of other adult travelers who the resort was originally designed for and that Four Sesaon's is greedily raking in revenue from.    THE GOOD:  Delightfully designed property. Comfortable beds. Appealing room decor and amenities. Meandering paths. Manicured, understated, beautiful landscapes, Wonderful restaurants and food offerings. UNBELIEVABLY relaxing and top notch offerings at the  spa/fitness areas. Terrific oceanside path. Cultural center. THE OUTSIDE SPA GARDEN. THE COLD PLUNGE. THE OUTSIDE SHOWERS in the rooms and the spa.    THE BAD:  Kids overtaking EVERY venue. Screaming kids running in and out of all restaurants while others are dining, including their parents who look the other way and enjoy at everyone else's expense. Kids interfering with others' tables in every restaurant venue. Parents leaving kid messes behind for others to attend to. Kids overtaking the Shell Pool and the ""QUIET"" Beach Tree pool. Floats and blow up toys in the pools. Kids in the fitness area on equipment and in the lap pool at the spa. Kids terrorizing the golf course, sand traps and greens while golfers are actively on the course and starter looks on. Kids overtaking entertainment stage at the BeachTree lounge/restaurant.    Four Seasons' attitude is ""there are a couple weeks after Labor Day and into early October you can book to avoid kids. Also a couple weeks after Easter and before summer vacation as well"". REALLY...I have to restrict my travel there to a very few weeks. Obviously I am no longer a priority, valued customer...JUST BE AWARE when you book that FAMILIES and KIDS are the preferred customers at Four Season Hualalai.

526374915,40,Great vacation spot!!,"We had an amazingly memorable stay here. Granted this particular Four Seasons property lucks out in terms of what the Big Island has to offer (which is A LOT), but the resort itself is still worthy of high marks. This is a place where you can spend your entire vacation and feel completely satisfied in terms of both relaxation and exploration.    The location might seem slightly remote on a map but it's easy to drive around on the island and there's nothing like going back to peace and quiet after a day of exploring the island. It's only about a 10 minute drive from the airport and 30 minutes to Kona and Waimea. It's also easy enough (and definitely worth it) to take day trips to the West side of the island (to the volcano national park, Maura Kea, Hilo, etc.).    The property is beautifully maintained (yes very Instagram worthy for all the millenials out there) and very spread out, which I personally prefer over the usual single large building because this ends up feeling more like apartments than rooms. I do have to say that the rooms themselves are on the older end of the spectrum -- I'd describe them more as spacious and classic rather than sleek and chic (which the FS Lanai is) -- however, they're of course very clean and comfortable.    There are 3 main pools plus a snorkeling pond. We spent all of our time by the quiet pool, which is decently large, gorgeous, swimmable, and serene. The spa is one of the best I've seen!! It's mostly outdoors, which I loved and they have wonderful amenities (hot tub, cold plunge pool, eucalyptus steam room, dry sauna). The therapists are also extremely competent. One downside is that the tennis courts are an extra charge ($55 for an hour, which is almost urban city pricing) -- not sure if this is a new policy at FS resorts or not but this was not the case in Kudaa Hura (Maldives) and Bora Bora.    For dining, just based on our food moods, we stuck to Ulu for breakfast and The Beach Tree for pool-side lunch and dinners. The breakfast buffet at Ulu is solid but not cheap at ~$50 per person if I remember correctly. It also seems to be quite disorganized for breakfast. Each time we had breakfast here, the wait was rather lengthy (15 minutes) even though there were tables (nice ones, at that) open. As a result, there's usually a line built up by the hostess desk and some hangry people waiting. The Beach Tree is dependable Italian fare with legit Neapolitan pizzas. And I'd also recommend NOT ordering room service pizza....we thought it'd be a take out version of the Beach Tree one but it was extremely disappointing....tasted like frozen DiGiorgno's.    All in all, it's a beautiful place to relax and offers the convenience of easily being able to go outside of the resort compound for some amazing exploration trips. It's probably one of the best places to park yourself for an amazing vacation.",Sep 2017,August 2017,Traveled as a couple,,"New York City, New York"

The restaurants were excellent as well; the prices are high, but the quality is there both in terms of the food itself but also the setting. The spa was also wonderful.

525246246,40,You will pay-a lot-for this quality,"Sensational hotel. Amazing quality in every department. Lovely staff. But ridiculously expensive...for everything. It is the food cost that makes it unreasonable, especially as portions are small and tightly managed for profitability. A salad 7 inches in diameter and 2 inches tall for $ 20.00. If that doesn't bother you....this is a terrific hotel. I gulped at every meal at the extravagance and that, unfortunately, leaves a bad taste. The gym programs are excellent-but again eye opening expensive. And the hotel's remoteness makes it a bit of a scam as one rarely leaves the resort as there is really nothing commercial away from it. So generally speaking if the costs are within your reach- this is a phenomenal hotel. If budget is an issue...pick another hotel.

Even check in is superb - you are seated with tropical concoction in hand, along with leis and cool towels. Rooms are bungalow-style, as opposed to a tower, and they meander along the entirety of the property. Ours faced the ocean with a back porch slider that went out to the ""quiet pool,"" and had a beautiful outdoor shower that our kids said felt like a jungle waterfall. One expects fantastic service at a Four Seasons, but even I was pleasantly surprised by the complimentary washer/dryers outside of our room. Had I known in advance, we would have packed much differently In fact,this is definitely a barefoot kind of resort - very relaxed and casual, & most of the clothes that t I did bring along seemed silly and out of place when I arrived. The food was marvelous (we are still talking about the coconut muffins and scones, & the innovative combos of fresh pressed juices every morning). Our entire family was mesmerized each evening just staring at the star filled sky, that seemed so much closer and clearer than anything we have ever experienced. Who knew it could be so easy to identify Maui's Fish Hook in the constellations?    My only suggestion would be to fly direct to Kona from the mainland, rather than going through the inter-island terminal in Honolulu.

That being said, our last visit three years ago there were a few rough edges: tired decor in the rooms and overstretched staffing in the restaurants. I'm happy to report, all of that is now resolved. The resort is top notch. We had a suite for three nights with an outdoor shower, a real treat. I imagine all rooms have good views but those on the upper floors are likely to be better - but you don't get the outdoor shower. We ate in the Ulu and Beach Tree restaurants. Although they have different ambiences, the food is first rate - but not cheap, be warned! The spa and gym are a must, fabulously well equipped and served.

If you want to visit Kona, go early as traffic in the afternoon is often heavy. The coffee plantations are even further away. The waterfalls are an hour or more north and volcano visits are definitely day trips. The hotel has a great spa, work out area, tennis courts, climbing wall and is adjacent to a golf course. The hotel has a quiet/adult pool, kids pool, family pool and the King Pond. In front of the hotel is a section of the ocean that is enclosed by a break wall making it great for swimming & snorkeling for kids and adults. We had dinner the first evening at the Beach Tree. The food was great but the service is slow. We had a similar dinner experience at Ulu. Great food but very slow service. So, when it comes to dining, know that it will be a very relaxed experience. So, if you take kids, plan accordingly and head to dinner before they are hungry. The service at breakfast was better as the restaurant was not as busy - but we ate on the early side.

It is designed in a way that does not make you feel like you are at a large resort. There are a variety of areas to sit and relax around the 3 pools and beach. They have a system to alleviate the dreaded lounge chair roulette that you encounter at many resorts...well done. There is NO saving seats all day, etc. You can reserve for 30 minutes and if you don't show up...they go to someone else....except for a lunchtime when you can save them for 2 hours. The pool attendants are very pleasant and attentive...quick to respond and satisfy your every need!  We had a ocean front king room with a beautiful view. It was very comfortable and well appointed...bathroom was spacious and functioned well, good closet space. It was slightly dated looking, especially when compared to our last summer vacation at Four Seasons Maui and Lanai!! We much prefer this resort to Maui....we would not go back there...only because that huge resort feel is not our vibe. Lanai is magical...but a week might be too long as there is very little to do there.  Overall great experience....and you pay for it!!!! We expected it to be pricey but a few times it was quite shocking! Cocktails are $20./ea. Dinners are $$$$. Shops are $$$$.  Spa is $$$$. But, I guess you get what you pay for ... and this is a lovely slice of heaven.  Would love to bring the whole family, but might just be too expensive. There were a lot of little kids there... all having a great time!

517829761,50,Paradise,"Visited here last winter and absolutely loved it. We came just before the Christmas rush and it was probably only 70% full. We got upgraded via the AMEX FHR program to a room with an outdoor shower. This was the best outdoor shower we've ever had! The room itself was spacious and set up very nicely with a great patio for sunset cocktails.    The hotel has several pools so it never feels too crowded. The service at the pools was extraordinary. Our sunglasses were cleaned daily. When our water glasses needed to be refilled, they dumped out the warm water instead of just topping it off. Treats were brought out each day and the pool crew learned our names early on. The service here far exceeded our experience at the FS Maui.    The restaurants were all really good but our favorite was ULU. The tableside poke is a must and something I still dream about. Again, service in all of the restaurants far exceeded our high expectations.    King's Pond was a lagoon on property that you could snorkel in. They provide all of the snorkel gear complimentary. They had a stingray that you could feed each morning. This was a big plus since the ocean was a bit rocky and there wasn't much snorkeling onsite. My husband spent time in the pond each day and still talks about it.    The gym was fantastic and they even had basketball courts and a rock climbing wall. One big bonus for us was that the hotel had a great jogging trail of varying lengths around the property / golf course. It got hot very early due to the lava rock but was nice to be able to run outside while on vacation.

516553161,50,Just booked another trip here two weeks after we got home!,"An amazing, luxurious, private resort devoid of snobby obstentatiousness yet absolutely attentive to aesthetic pleasures at all levels!    My partner and I were a bit worried about staying here, despite our positive experiences at other Four Seasons. We are both very obviously LGBT, and also tend to ""stick out"" at resorts due to our tattoos and eclectic fashion sense. We are very quiet people as well, despite our appearance. We are not into ""fame"", and were lucky enough to make a lot of money in the industry behind the scenes back in an era--pre internet--where music was very different in terms of both lifelines for alienated youths and potential cash cow for certain introverted multi instrumentalists. While I digress, I do want to mention that the last thing we want while staying at a five star hotel with our tattooed aging hipster weirdo gay selves is having to justify how we made our money...or worse, constantly interrogated by security guards for our room number.    Thankfully, this was not a thing at Four Seasons Hualalai (apologies for my inability to figure out how to type the diacritics). Everyone, without exception, was friendly, welcoming, kind, and engaging. Of course the grounds, food, wine, rooms, and service were flawless...this is the Four Seasons. But the lack of judgmental pretentiousness towards our eclecticism made us love this resort so much that we are choosing to come back in a few months rather than head to a locale in St John's which we did love, but seemed not only less friendly, but also less aesthetically pleasing.    My partner and I had six flawless nights at Four Seasons Hualalai last month. We will be back in a couple months, and--barring a drop in this resort's unobtrusive yet friendly and accepting relations towards those of us in the LGBT community--will look forward to staying at this gorgeous resort multiple times a year for years to come!    Also: We really appreciated the quiet, heated adult pool with swim up bar, the King's Pond (as one of us is a certified scuba diver and enjoyed the pond on days he wasn't on a dive boat, where his partner is bored to tears!), and the lovely walk to the beach where Honu can be observed and swam with at a safe distance of course!",Aug 2017,August 2017,Traveled as a couple,,

515330719,50,PERFECTION,"This FS hotel could not be better. From the moment you arrive, until your departure, you are taken care of in a way that makes you feel special and is unforgettable. Every single staff member is unique: at the reception, the concierge, the pool staff, restaurants staff, house cleaning.....the rooms are gorgeous with beautiful views, the grounds are stunning. We only used the ""adults pool"" and it was peaceful: salt water, no piped music, no diving etc. every morning we did our laps at 7 am and we were the only ones there until at least 10 am! The restaurants are amazing : Ulu, the Beach Tree...we ate there every day. Disappointed with the Grill because they did not carry local Kobe beef, only USA imports...we were explained that the American clientele did not want the ""chewy"" but tastier local beef...oh well, their loss.    I could not recommend this hotel more. Their patch of beach is tranquil and not wavy...lots of sea turtles and snorkeling, the beach sunsets are beyond gorgeous and really appreciated the quality of the musicians who came every evening to The Beach House and to Ulu restaurants. really: Four Seasons you rock!    Also a few other perks were: the amazing snorkeling fish pond, the endless supply of fresh drinking ice water by the pool, the smoothies and popsicles( also by the pool ) the sunglass cleaning service and the yoga lessons at dawn.

511928099,50,Amazing Anniversary Getaway.....,"Four Seasons Hualalai is just magical! We came here for our honeymoon and after 4 kids returned again for our anniversary. There is no doubt that choosing FS Hualalai for such a special occasion was the best choice.    The drive alone, into the resort is very scenic. Upon arrival the valet porters are already waiting to greet the guests, by name! We were greeted with leis, cool towels, and fresh mai-tais. We were taken by golf cart to our room....    Our room..... WOW! We had the most amazing view! We had the ocean front room which came with an unobstructed view of the ocean! We were able to walk out onto our lanai and enjoy breakfast daily with the most amazing view! Although the room is a bit on the smaller side, I will take smaller room with fabulous amenities and top of the line customer service!    During our last visit we left the hotel and went out on several excursions. This time we decided to stay and enjoy the resort. FS Hualalai has absolutely everything you need and not have to leave the resort at all.    We stayed at the Palm Grove section of the resort. We were just a few steps from the pool and the pool is just a few steps from the beach. The Palm Grove pool is for adults only and has a swim up bar. We arrived later in the day when the swim up bar was already closed. After our day of traveling we just wanted to relax. The bartender did not know this yet he was gracious enough to allow us a couple a drinks as we just relaxed and watched the sunset! Sunsets here are the most amazing and breathtaking sunsets we've ever enjoyed! During our stay we were able to reserve the day beds at Palm Grove Pool. I was able to lay out on the chaise and catch some sun while my husband relaxed under the shade. Win Win! You receive full service at the day beds and they always make rounds with ice-water.    We were surprised to return to our room after turn down service came by and our room was full of orchids. From our bed all the way to the restroom and bathtub. Now, we've already experienced this before, but each time it has been very special. This was the most romantic night of all.    We tried the different eateries on site, like the Luau and Uluu (reviewed separately). We also got to do snorkeling at kings pond. There are just too many activities to name them all.    Bottomline is this place is absolutely amazing! Everyone will go out of their way to accommodate you!

511025161,50,Fabulous 50th!,"We visited Hawaii to celebrate my partner's 50th birthday.    We spend our first 5 nights on the island at the Four Seasons Hualalai resort.    I was contacted by the concierge several weeks before our trip and given information on activities available, and the various restaurant details. Bearing in mind we would be there during peak season, I decided to book the luau evening in advance, and reserve a table at the ULU grill for my partners birthday.    On arrival we were greeted with cold towels, leis and a drink. We were taken to our room by golf cart. The golf view rooms are on the edge of the resort, away from the main areas and pools. They are quiet and private and still have views of the ocean and sunsets. We had an upper floor room with balcony that was private and not overlooked at all. The sun shone on it all day, and we could watch the stars at night.    We enjoyed the luau on our first evening very much. Not cheap, but free flowing drinks and an extensive buffet including the pig cooked in the ground. There were cultural activities (lei making, traditional tattoos etc) and then the singing, dancing , fire-eating and ukulele playing. All great fun, enjoyed by all ages.    We preferred o spend our days at the adult only pool, and had cocktails at the swim up bar and in the hot tub there. There were plenty of places each morning and the pool staff keep your loungers while you go off for lunch.    The kids pool looked very busy with families, as was the ""quiet"" pool. I suspect getting a lounger there might be more of a challenge....    We ate in all the restaurants during our stay. Our favourite for dinner was the Hualalai Grill at the golf club. We also liked relaxed lunches at the Residents Beach House. The Beach Tree restaurant was always busy with families as it was next to the kids pool area. All the food we had was excellent.    We were luckily enough to see a turtle on the beach one morning as it struggled back down the sand to the ocean. Very special. We also saw some wonderful sunsets.    All the staff here are wonderful. Helpful, cheerful, friendly, attentive but not over the top. Service is what this sort of resort is all about. We couldn't fault it.    Of course this doesn't come cheap, and everything was just soooo expensive (especially as the pound isn't doing so well against the dollar!). However, this is what we expected, and we were celebrating in style. You're only 50 once!    After 5 nights of relaxing, eating, drinking and topping up our tans , we were sad to leave, but looking forward to our next adventure on the other side of the island...",Aug 2017,July 2017,Traveled as a couple,Golf view room - away from the main areas - peaceful and private.

510379359,50,Amazing! A Truly Magical Resort!,"This was our second visit to The Four Season's Hualalai and it was absolutely amazing. The hotel has beautiful grounds, the rooms are spectacular, and the staff anticipate your every need. As soon as you arrive at the hotel you feel as though you have been transported to magical place that can't possibly be real. The check in process is relaxing with fresh juice, fruit and cool towels and the staff was so welcoming from the start. We were given a beautiful room near the palm grove pool with a lava rock shower. It was quiet and beautifully appointed. They even included some treats for my husband's birthday! The hotel is arranged with four main pool crescents (although there is also a kid's pool and lap pool). Each crescent has a pool, hot tub, and beach front with lots of seating and cabana options. We were very impressed by the staff at the beach and pools. They were very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed to be comfortable. We enjoyed hanging out at the beach and by the palm grove pool which is the 21+ adult pool with a swim up bar. Snorkeling at the King's Pond is also a must do! Guaranteed fish and eagle ray sightings right on property! There is also the seashell (family pool), and beach tree (quiet pool) to meet everyone's needs. We had very pleasant experiences at the restaurants on property as well. My husband has celiac and the restaurants had tons of gluten free options and were very accommodating and ensured no cross contamination. We very much appreciate this care and attention to detail. We ate at Beach Tree and Ulu. Beach tree is great for lunch with lots of options. We ate there for dinner one night too and enjoyed the food. I couldn't decide between two different pasta dishes-- so they brought me a half portion of each! Both were delicious! Ulu has great sushi and entrees. We really enjoyed sitting at the Bar with Doug and enjoying great service, drinks, and sunset! Overall the Four Seasons Hualalai is an amazing place. It isn't just a hotel but an experience. The only ""con"" was that we didn't want to leave... so we never made it to Mauna Kea like we planned.

We agree with all the positive reviews, staff is great, location is great etc. We loved that the rooms and restaurants are super close to the ocean, when you eat lunch or dinner at most of the restaurants you are within a few feet of the beach and that's incredibly special, you feel very connected to the water. Sunsets were beautiful. I am a swimmer and I was in heaven swimming in the bay about a 10 minute walk south of the resort, it's the perfect spot for a swim and they have a nice mile long course mapped out. We hung out at the Palm Grove adult pool, we don't have kids so it worked out great, it's quiet and met a lot of fun people. They also have the swim up bar. We ate most of our meals at the resort because it's not really close to much, however, food is very good. Just be prepared to spend what Hawaii and Four Seasons commands.

508112880,30,"Rental Unit, Four Seasons Hualalai Resort, Hualalai, Hawaii","1. Documentation for rental units is complex, 5+/- pages including photos of each person in residence all in advance of arrival.  2. All local calls are long distance on your cell phone, no room phones.  3. Bring hand wash cloths, none provided. Also, only liquid soap is provided. If prefer soap bars when showering be sure to buy some when make stocking trip to grocery store, approximately 5 miles.  4. The multiple site maps can be confusing and some details are either missing or inconsistent. Maps can also be hard to read.  5. Is this Four Seasons in financial difficulty? Fees are many, charged to renters to the point of getting the buffalo off the nickel for even minuscule items. The capstone is the 4% surcharge for using your credit card. Also, guests at nearby rentals have to pay serious money for resort amenities access which is sold in three consecutive-day blocs. They also are not individually available, group purchase required.  6. Overall, prices are high across the board. For example a simple buttered bagel cost $5.00 at the low priced Trading Company store. A plus at Trading Company is a gas pump immediately outside the entrance.  7. Requires a lot of walking due to limited car parking and a large zone barring access to cars and golf carts. This is definitely a spread-out resort, no central building/hotel. The ""lobby"" is a standalone building accessible by climbing stairs or drive through drop-off.  8. Golf cart pathways were a bit rough so that some people drive them on the roads for cars.  9. On site dinner reservations can be difficult forcing dining at 5:30 opening or 8 PM or standby waiting. Make your dinner reservations well before arrival.  10. Meals are expensive, breakfast for two at Lulu $80 w/tip. Dinners for 4 (2 adults + 2 older kids) including tip and glass of wine, depending on venue, $275-$400. Food is excellent. Ocean and sunset views from dinning areas are superb.  11. Only 2 or 3 bugs in our unit, no big deal. They supply bug killer.  12. Had to use iP flashlight to read thermostat, seems dated. Also had to put hat over bright clock face so didn't keep us awake at night. Last, dishwasher is either dated or a cheap model.  13. Nice ocean views, spacious unit. Weather 75-85 degrees, humidity 60-90% depending on time of day (Mid-Summer, 2017). Pools and beaches are nicely done, excellent. Golf course and grounds in general are visually beautiful and well maintained, excellent. Service is excellent and staff friendly.    If you enjoy baking in the sun, hanging out at pool, golf, tennis, eating good food, excellent service and spending serious amounts of money for this then this place could be for you.

505861309,50,Still amazing-some flaws,"We visited hualalai for the 5th time in 5 years November of 2015. Our previous stays had been absolutely flawless leaving nothing to be desired.    During our most recent stay we did encounter some hiccups.    All previous stays we had noted our preference to be ground floor with outdoor shower, this time we were told we would have an upstairs room and there was no way to accommodate us in a ground floor room (aside from paying thousands more for a suite).    The first room (2nd floor) we were put in did have AC issues and we had to be moved, for which a dinner was comped for the inconvienence. This was very kind of the staff.    Although the rest of our stay was for the most part amazing and I still consider this property my favorite of anywhere I have been in the world I was upset that as multi time repeat guests there was no way to get us in a ground floor room. Ultimately we were fairly compensated for this issue but I hold this property to such a high level I was disappointed.    I will say we have planned a trip to return this coming October and I am so excited to come back and bring my son and my parents to experience my little slice of heaven for the first time.    Most likely if you go everything will be perfect as the staff really does everything in their power to ensure your needs are met.    I have to give a special shout out to one of the best bar tenders Tom at ULU who remembers us from year to year and always makes us feel special! And in all honesty two of the absolute best servers I have encountered in traveling extensively- Leia and lauentiau at the beach tree. They are truly exceptional and look forward to seeing them year after year. They are world class and make dining there so much fun!    The food (especially beach tree) scenery, staff, pools, sunsets are among the best in the world as many others have said.

505733651,30,"Great place, but disapointing experience...","Stayed for 6days in june/july this year.    The resort itself is lovely and one of the nicest in the world probably.    We still had a couple of bad experiences that still made it a disapointment for us.    1.  The resort is very family friendly, which i ofcourse dont mind, but they also have adult pools so we can stay there if we want to. Since we dont have kids thats what we preferred. But that pool is so small that it was difficult to get chairs there. The hotel is very determined that you cant reserve chairs with towels and such. But the pool area was all taken before breakfast almost every day. And to make things even better, the hotel reserved chairs/beds for guests. Not a good thing.    2.  We had arranged a dinner under the stars for our 5year anniversary. The weather that day was kinda bad, with a lot of rain during the dinner itself. Problem was not the weather, but planning from the resort. The private table we got, was probably not even 10m from the restaurant. Which meant that we were less than 1m from the walkway. So we had probably 100people walk past us during our dinner. It started raining, and they had not set up our back up table yet. Approximatly a 30min break in the middle of the meal and luke warm dish after that. Server seemed to have more gueste to attend than our table.  Couple of days later i sent in an email and complained. Got a reply close to 10days later, after mentioning the missing reply in a guest survey mail. The answer i got was that he had been busy with investigating.  The most annoying part with this experience was that i got questioned why i had been so pleasant during the dinner itself. What good would it bring for me to blow my top during the anniversary dinner with my wife?    3.  Dinner at the grill/steak house. I had initially meant to let nr two just pass by, but after another disapoiting dinner experience i just could not let it pass, since it was not at all up to four seasons standard. We got seated right behind a large dinner group that had some grill your own food. Wind into the restaurant meant that we had the fumes/smoke from them blow onto our table. I asked to switch tables, but was told that a corner table was so wobbly it was no good for us. Strange thing was that there was two people dinning at that table when we came in. Table nex to that one was occupied, but we where told we could have that one when they left (which we didnt).    We waited 30minutes to get drinks. Which was so late that they ended up being complimentary. Dinner took forever to get. I was kinda annoyed at this point :)    Server probably noticed and asked if we wanted desert, we said no. I had just had a big steak. She asked if we were celebrating something. And i said no, but that we had celebrated our 5year anniversary a couple of days ago. I also asked for the check at this time. She probably did not listen clearly as she was stressed.    She brought us a desert that said congrats on our 5year anniversary. I had complained about the table, asked for a different one, 30min delay on drinks and said no to desert and no to ""do u celebrate something tonite"". I just felt like an idiot and ate the bloody cake :)    Steak was good, but waiter seemed distant and stressed and overall a weird and bad experience.    So overall the resort ended as kind of an disapointment despite us having a good time there. Very annoying to get a the feeling that they thought i was only after a refund when i sent the initial email.

The rooms are quite nice but a little dated especially for the price. my main complaint is that the restaurants with the exception of Ulu Grill's breakfast seemed to be short on servers and service was slow. The food was not bad just nothing amazing. The breakfast buffet was our favorite- wonderful food and service. I do think the resort is overpriced and you will pay extra for just about everything.

Nothing beats the King's Pond which allows fully protected snorkelling and marine biology in the hotel itself. The protected ocean swim area is a welcome necessity as are all the pools on the property.,Jul 2017,July 2017,Traveled with family,,"London, England, United Kingdom"

Our children were finally old enough to really enjoy everything, from the beach itself to Kings Pond. Everyone is over the top nice and accommodating. We brought our Pug and were welcomed all over the resort. Couldn't have been more satisfied by our stay.",Jul 2017,February 2017,Traveled with family,,"Mendocino County, California"

Although all staff was great, I am writing this review specifically for Jake, the Ocean Pool Attendant. When I wanted a beach side chair set up with some towels, Jake was there. Needed a refill on my water or cocktail, Jake was there before I even had to as. Even when I (unfortunately) had sea urchin spines stick into and break off into my hand, Jake was there with a first aid kit and instructions on how to care for it. So if you are staying in the resort, I highly recommend setting up your beach day lounge chair in Jake's section. He'll take care of you...just remember to take care of him ;)",Jul 2017,July 2017,Traveled with family,Be sure to ask for a bottom floor room with an outdoor shower.

502697653,50,"Best resort in Hawai‘i, no question","My husband and I have volunteered at the Run for Hope charity event the Four Seasons Hualālai for a number of years now, and we have always been impressed with how amazing the staff here is even with event volunteers, so we figured being here as a guest must be even MORE amazing. And I'm pleased to say we were right!    We have stayed at the Resort twice now, once just before the Run for Hope event and most recently for our 15th anniversary. Both times were absolutely incredible. When I mentioned that we were volunteering with Run for Hope the first time, they upgraded us to a huge suite that included a living room area and even some ""pets"" (ʻōpaeʻula). For our anniversary, we weren't quite as lucky, but they did upgrade us from a partial ocean view room to an ocean view one, which really makes room service breakfast (included in our room rate) an entirely different experience. We were also fortunate once again to snag a ground-floor room, which meant we also got that beautiful outdoor shower!    New experience for us this time around: Snorkeling in King's Pond. Do not miss this! The pond has limited hours (it closes at 4 p.m.) for environmental sustainability reasons, so make it a point to get there during daylight hours. If you have never snorkeled before, this is a great place to try it, and gear is complimentary for resort guests. The pond is absolutely beautiful above and under water.    Overall a wonderful experience for anyone, but perhaps especially for kama‘aina, who rarely have the chance to experience this level of hospitality in our own environment!",Jul 2017,July 2017,Traveled as a couple,Ground level rooms have outdoor (in addition to indoor) showers -- amazing!,"Honolulu, Hawaii"

We first visited the resort in 2001 and went back every year through 2006, then took a break when our kids were young. We just returned with them and found that the resort is just as beautiful and that the food and restaurants are much improved. Service is top notch and there are many activities for children (ours are 8 and 10). For adults, the spa had a wide menu of services; the gym was well appointed and had good fitness classes; and should you have left anything, the boutiques were stocked with just about anything you or your family might need.

The room we stayed in was spacious with a large balcony, and a huge bathroom, excellently appointed and incredibly clean. All of the restaurants had a wide choice of high quality food and the concierge made booking excursions very easy.    A couple of grumbles - if you don't get to the pools early and the resort is busy, you won't always get chairs, and/or chairs with shade - something i would expect if paying 1k a night. Also breakfast can get busy as the morning progresses so a 5-10 min wait wasn't unusual, again i would think you are paying to avoid that.

Marcia, one of the staff at the concierge desk was a magic genius helping us with some adjustments to our initial travel plans. She made our already very good vacation plans perfect!  One only flaw (to an otherwise perfect vacation) was a ""mix-up"" with our reservation and room assignment that left me sleeping on a sofa-bed :-( ...

The room was immaculate: large, richly decorated, and every amenity a guest may possibly need was anticipated and provided. Housekeeping left it perfect every morning and evening. The restaurants served outstanding food, in particular, Ulu, where we dined for breakfast and dinner. The staff was warm, friendly, and professional. I can go on and on with all the superlatives.

Some specifics from my most recent visit: --Huge fan of the new (post-tsunami) Palm Grove adult pool with the swim-up bar. Not a lot of seating, but it was quiet and the drinks were AMAZING - the bartender used fresh ingredients grown next to the pool. --Rooms are luxurious and comfortable. Love the outdoor showers in the ground floor rooms. --Spa is amazing. Love the eucalyptus steam room and the cold plunge. I had two excellent massages (Lomi Lomi & Swedish). --Service in the restaurants was very slow (even beyond ""island time"") and there were other smaller things (golf reservations, etc.) that were incorrect. Housekeeping service was also inconsistent (getting our rooms made up in the AM was hit or miss) - definitely noticed a decrease in the service quality from my visit two years ago. --Food was good, but not great - missing the wow factor that I remember and nothing on the menus (aside from the breakfast brunch) was memorable. Not a lot of variety on the menus, which got repetitive even during our one week visit. That being said, I had the ceviche (appetizer at the Beach Tree) for lunch every single day of our trip!

However, after complaining to Management about this person, two people really went above and beyond to make our dining experiences wonderful - Dejan Todorovic and Alessandoro Cartumini both in management in food and beverage. Even after we had ""moved on"" from the incidents - They were absolute gentlemen and could not have been kinder or more accommodating.

498677992,10,Customer Service Nightmare,"My wife and I planned our first anniversary around visiting the Four Seasons Hualalai. We had honeymooned in Istanbul at a four seasons and it was the best trip of our lives. Unfortunately 24 hours before our arrival, we received a phone call that the resort was closing because a hurricane might come close to the island. We of course respect the safety decision (though it turned out to be wrong) but oddly, the woman that called had no plan for us. No recommendation of a neighboring property that wasn't closed or opportunity to stay at another four seasons on another Hawaiian island. So we had 24 hours to completely rebook flights and hotels for the rest of our vacation.    Over a month after the cancellation, the hotel finally reached out with an offer for 1 free night to compensate for the thousands of dollars in rebooking costs they had caused. Though it was a weak attempt at an apology, we were ok with it at the time because we hoped to visit the following summer (2017).    When we learned my wife was pregnant and due early September 2017 (!!), we realized we wouldn't be able to do our normal august trip to Hawaii and reached out to four seasons customer service to ask that the offer be extended for one year so we could recoup some of our losses in 2018.    After receiving a nice reply that we would hear soon about our request, four seasons went dark for over a week. I followed up again and was ""offered"" a 40 day extension from September 20 2017 to November 1 2017, the first 40 days of our baby's life (which the staff knew from our email). I asked again if they could be reasonable given they had cost us thousands of dollars and the pregnancy was really something that should be celebrated... they offered another 15 days.    I've heard great things about this hotel but they unfortunately could not handle the customer service challenge from the hurricane threat. We will not be joining them in the future. It's not worth it if something goes wrong - they do not understand the four seasons customer first culture.",Jul 2017,July 2017,Traveled as a couple,,

I can't say enough good things about our experience. The spa was insanity, we indulged in the Romance Escape and can promise you it's all that it's racked up to be if not even more. We spent the first three days of our honeymoon dining like royalty, awaking before the sunrise to view sea turtles in their natural habit and breathtaking views, and the four seasons truly helped us create special memories.

496690384,50,Totally Redeemed themselves,"We returned to FS Hualalai after visiting 3 years ago. The last visit was not up to FS quality. This 8 night trip was a different story. Our room was next to the Palm Grove Adult Pool. While our 17 yr old son could not visit the pool, our room was right next to the pool and my wife and I loved it. The pool bartender, Grant-from New Zealand, was outstanding. He makes an amazing Traditional Mai Tai, it was unreal. The room was a small suite, but my son, wife, and I liked it. We visited all the pools and enjoyed them, especially Kings Pond. I think we went snorkeling everyday, my son loved it. We didn't use the fins, just mask and snorkel and floated around loving the colors of the fish.    I did go golfing at the resort 1 day and played 2 times. The clubhouse talks up the all included drink and snack cart. I saw him 1 time in 2 rounds. Luckily, they provide waters in the coolers. That needed major improvement. The course was in very good condition and greens were good too. The 17th is a gem for sure.    We self parked and we liked the fact that we had that option to come and go so freely.    The food at the resort was decent, not 5 star. I did not think the room service menu was very extensive.    Unfortunately, i have to work while on vacation, so a good business center is vital. Before re-booking, we were assured the problems with the so called business center we encountered 3 yrs ago had been fixed. They were not. The business center is 2 desks, 2 computers, and 2 printers that are exposed to the conditions. The printers rarely worked, but i did not let it diminish my vacation.

Upon arrival, we were upgraded three room categories (had booked through Amex FHR program but only entitled to a one category upgrade) to a full ocean-view room near the King's Pond. The pools were lovely and peaceful, with excellent pool-side service. We mostly hung out at the ""quiet pool"" near BeachTree and never left the resort! Because we never left, we ate all of our meals on-property, which was the only less-than-stellar aspect of our stay. We expected, and didn't mind paying, very high prices for food. However, for that much money, we thought we would get exceptional cuisine. And, while the ambiance at the restaurants was incredible, with most offering beach/water views (aside from Hualalai Grill), we felt like the dishes we were served were fine, but not great.

Breakfast buffet at Ulu, lunch at the Beachtree or by the pool. Ulu for dinner has the best chocolate soufflé ever!  Staff at the quiet pool was very attentive even though they were busy as the hotel was full. I felt I was in Gym heaven with a weight room, treadmill room, yoga room,spinning room, and a full lap pool.  We jogged a few mornings and the views are spectacular throughout the Hualalai Golf & residencial area. We played golf and the greens are beautifully manicured, the hole 17 and 18 are the best. One reco: we only saw the food cart once in 18 holes and there was not an option to get more drinks/snacks on hole 9/10.  And yes, beware of the sea urchins at the beach pool, a couple of friends stepped on them. Other than that, get your snorkel gear and enjoy swimming withthe beautiful fish and turtles.  Traders Store/gas station has everything from deli, meds, drinks to coffee/ pretty much everything.  Love the coffee machine in our room and the washing/dryer machines. It helps you to pack lighter than usual. Marcia and Debbie were very helpful at concierge in helping us book a helicopter ride and a snorkel tour with dolphins.  Although our bed was super comfy, The rooms are good but in need of a renovation and We heard that is coming up, so I'd like to make some recommendations when that happens:  More outlets at the bathroom , there was only 2  Make a pocket bathroom door, it is too tight now  Bigger beach tables at the beach beds, I keep dropping my water  Remove or hide the vacuum from the room, takes half of my shoe space  Fill the minibar- our only had wine and beer however we had a full menu of things we never saw.

Wished we could have been in a more central location but we didn't ask to switch rooms because as a trade off our spot was very quiet. The service was fabulous, as we have come to expect from the FS. Lots of smiling faces eager to help. My husband golfed twice and the course was beautiful (although the FS Lanai course had better views).

494999229,30,Anniversary flop,"Amazingly gorgeous location with substandard bed. This was excellent: complimentary champagne , local rate which included breakfast. Bell staff excellent. Here's the area to improve: The bed had sink holes on each edge that swallows the guest . You can not roll to the middle because there is a mound volcano in the middle of the bed. At check out ( we only stayed one day) we were asked how the stay was and we shared the bed experience. The receptionist was dismissive and made excuses. While we did not ask for a discount, they gave us $100 off room price. Frankly I wanted a restful nights sleep and would have gladly paid regular price for it.

494913198,50,"Luxury, decadence, tranquility at its finest","From the moment my girlfriend and I crossed through the exclusive gates of the Four Seasons' palatial property at Hualalai, we knew we were in for a treat. Let's face it, though: certain expectations intensify when you're paying upwards of $1,000/night--over twice as much as neighboring hotels' rates--and we hoped the quality of our stay would at least be commensurate with the cost.    Let's just say our brief stay was worth every penny.    The level of service and detail at this hotel is worthy of six stars (out of five); every employee went the extra mile to ensure we had a comfortable, first-class experience from the second we arrived. From the leis and cocktails upon arrival to the complementary room upgrade and bottle of champagne (to celebrate our anniversary), the staff made us feel like royalty till our rueful departure. Adding to our sheer awe and delight were the quality of food/service at the restaurant (Beach Tree Bar)--arguably the best dinner we had on the island; the friendly honu (sea turtles) on the beach; and the world-class fitness facilities and spa. All of these things exceeded our expectations and made for an extraordinarily pampering visit.    How can you beat the quality of this resort? I'm not sure there's an answer. Sure, it's pricey, but if you're looking for an island experience that will knock your socks off in every possible way, forget cost for a minute and treat yourself.

491341567,20,Mixed bag but priced for perfection,"Goal is to be fair-- nothing whiny. Hope this proves useful to people thinking about a luxury trip to Hawaii. Pros and cons below. Might be for you, might not.    Skipping to conclusion: we (me, wife, baby) won't return and were not happy with experience. Not a disaster-- anyone who can't enjoy Hawaii has issues-- but I'd advise going elsewhere.    Pros:  (1) Property is beautiful, convenient, and private. Impeccable grounds, fantastic views (superlatives warranted); a quick 15min drive to; and the property is set far off the main road, so no noise or intrusions.  (2) Some of the staff is truly great. Some of the people here are amazing: friendly, warm, and fun. I'd guess this was about 50% of our experience.  (3) Food in restaurants beat expectations. When we dined in the restaurants, we were thrilled. Delicious.  (4) Gym is perfect. Ice cold gatorade/water, open machines, everything you need.    Okay, so plenty of good stuff. And yet I come out with two stars. Here's the bad:    (1) Room/service. We reserved a king bed. First two nights (of seven) were for a wedding. Long story short, through a couple phone calls I was definitively assured a king despite wedding stuff. Upon arrival, our print-out also read ""king bed."" But the room had two small beds. They couldn't find a king room anywhere and we were told repeatedly, ""we confirmed that wedding guests were told kings couldn't be reserved."" Passive way of saying I'm wrong or lying-- I had just given my recollection about the phone conversations. Ultimately, we didn't get a king room until the 4th night, and that room was on the far side of everything by the parking lot. You might get a perfect room, but the thing to worry about is the response. We were made to feel like it was our fault and that we were inconveniencing them. We had to remind ourselves, wait, this is a super expensive vacation, we aren't crazy to want to sleep together.  (2) Some of the service is bad. We ordered a tomato and mozzarella salad and forty minutes later we got a box with lettuce and soggy tomatoes (no cheese). We ordered a cheeseburger and it came a burger in a bun on a plate (literally nothing else). Drinks took 45min if ordered poolside and required polite reminders. We asked for a pack n' play but it took a couple days (people forget). Etc. etc. People kept forgetting about us.  (3) Prices. Salad above was > $30. Drinks are $18 each. Room + food comes out to $1k+/night. Irksome thing is, every tiny thing is too much (massage $180, golf club rental $80, etc.). If money is no object, feel free to ignore. For us, it was stressful.  (4) Be aware surfing isn't part of the deal here...the nearest surfing is a 30-min drive away and isn't that great. No fault here, just something worth noting.",Jun 2017,June 2017,Traveled with family,,"Palo Alto, California"

490241423,50,5 stars - Didn't want to leave!,"We stayed at the Four Seasons Hualalai to finish off our 2 week trip to Hawaii. As a 5 star resort, expectations were high--but it did not disappoint.    Even before we arrived, the resort called us to make sure they could best prepare for our stay. When I informed them that we would be celebrating my husband's birthday, we were welcomed with a small birthday cake in our room. Even our room was upgraded for the occasion. It's the attention to these little details that makes all the difference.    The staff were wonderful as well. Everyone from the bellboy, who golf-carted us to our room upon arrival (I don't recall his name, but he shared that he lived in Yorkville, Toronto at one point in time); Jake, the pool attendant, who so pleasantly obliged and took nice photos of us in the hot tub during our first Four Season Hualalai sunset; from the ""greeter"" at the Beach Grill restaurant who greeted us by name every time we walked by (I don't recall her name unfortunately--but she is Hawaiian Asian and has a petite build); to our server at the Beach Grill restaurant (his name also escapes me, but he studied at the Uni. Of Hawaii Hilo) who was ""in"" on the birthday cake surprise for my husband; to Auli'li at the serenity pool who was also excellent in meeting any of our needs...the list goes on.    The only small hiccup of the stay was that my husband stepped on a sea urchin while swimming in the protected beach area of the hotel. While the hotel does inform guests that they clean the beach and that they recommend wearing reef shoes, it's the ocean after all and things happen from time to time. So warning to future guests: wear reef shoes if you are planning on entering the ocean! With that said, after my husband stepped on the urchin. I sought assistance from the ocean concierge, who was excellent and called security to assist my husband. They say these things happen frequently and they already had packs of vinegar prepared with gauge for treatment.    The food is pricey--but it's a 5 star resort, so it's to be expected. Nonetheless the food was delicious. I recommend the breakfast buffet.    Overall, we had a wonderful stay at the Four Seasons Hualalai, and I would not hesitate to visit again in the future.

Did not avail myself of golf course or driving range, but from a distance, these appeared to be impeccably groomed and wonderfully posh.    Only drawback to the resort is that it's spread out so expect to do some walking around the grounds. Thankfully, didn't encounter many mosquitoes as I suspect they do a fair bit of insecticide spraying.    There is parking on the grounds. Taxi ride from the airport cost around $27. Be aware that Uber and Lyft recently started services on the island (as of 03/2017 per my driver) but pickups are verboten from the airport, so you'll have to resort to a rental car or taxi, at least for the ride to the hotel.

489262432,40,Beautiful resort...but...,"My girlfriend and I stayed at the Four Seasons Hualalai at the end of April/beginning of May. We had just come from the Four Seasons resort on Oahu and were spoiled there by exquisite service which set the bar extremely high for our standards as what to expect from the Four Seasons on the Big Island. Unfortunately, the service was not at the same level.    The pros of the resort are it is a beautiful property. One of a kind paradise. Everything is pristine and well maintained. Rooms are beautiful and the outdoor shower in the room was pretty unique. The housekeeping staff is amazing and did a wonderful job! Probably the hardest working people on the property! The servers at the restaurants we went to were fantastic and the food was great.    Every employee we encountered was incredibly friendly, and went out of their way to say hello and smile. With that said, even though they were friendly, they lacked the service oriented aspect. As I stated earlier, we had come from Oahu and we didn't have to ask for a thing, it was provided to us before we could even ask. We did not notice the same level of service on the Big Island. From not having seats at the pool, to there not being cups for water, or sun screen running out and not being refilled to even running out of towels at the pool. We spent most of our time at the adult pool and the pool bar closed at 5 each day. When the pool bar closed, all the employees left even though the pool was still open. The problem we had was that on two separate occasions, the pool ran out of towels and we were stuck walking back to our room soaked because there were no employees around to restock the towels.  There were a few other occasions with concierge and the front desk where we had to seek them out to ensure our reservations or plans were confirmed, opposed to them seeking us, or calling to let us know that our reservations were good to go. One example is when we rented a car, we requested a convertible and were told they would let us know when our reservation was confirmed. After two days we did not hear anything. We tried calling but no one picked up so we ultimately walked to the front desk, waited in line, and had to see if our reservation went through. We then learned that we were being given a compact car. I assumed they were sold out of convertibles as that was what I requested. When I asked if there were any convertibles available I was told there were but they did not have anything in the notes indicating that's what we wanted.  Don't get me wrong, we had a wonderful time and these are a lot of little things, but when you're spending the amount of money we did for a five star experience, we expect the little things like towels and follow through from employees. Especially when we know it's possible as we had just received that kind of treatment from the Four Seasons on Oahu.  My take is that some of the employees have just gotten lackadaisical over time as they are established. Opposed to the Four Seasons Oahu where they are new and still trying to create a five star reputation.  I did have the opportunity to speak with one of the managers, Mr Pollak who was very kind and accommodating while assisting us with a billing issue we had. He was very empathetic as we discussed some of the issues, and after speaking with him, I am confident that the issues we encountered will be remedied for other guests. We are hoping that our experience was a fluke and want to return again for the five star treatment that we know is possible and have heard so much about.",May 2017,May 2017,Traveled as a couple,,

489087410,50,Paradise!,What a beautiful resort! 4 Seasons rocks the big island! I would highly recommend this resort. Kings pond is one of the coolest attractions I have seen.

489072042,30,Beautiful Property,My husband and I stayed here in March 2017 for our 5 year wedding anniversary. Booked it through the AMEX Travel site and prepaid for it. Not realizing that could have booked it through the Platinum Program and had breakfast and upgrade included we attempted to to do it once we arrived at the suggestion of the recption guest. Turned out it was a whole lot of time wasted as the hotel notified us to call AMEX. We did and they had to go back to hotel to see if could change it and hotel finally advised them that we could not. very disappointing start and frustrated over the hotel's lack of support on this issue on our special occassion. Other than that the property is beautifual and the pools are ver nice. The sand and beach is not much to discuss as there are better beached elsewhere. the staff at the main breakfast restaurant was very hospitable. had to wait a few times for a table in the morning which was odd again giving a feeling of being at an Applebees. The room facing the golf course was okay. it could use a bit of remodeling. We had heard many great things about this property and have stayed at many of other four seasons properties and luxury resorts aroudn the world but have to say it was a bit disappointing and did not live up to expectations.,May 2017,March 2017,Traveled as a couple,,"Los Angeles, California"
489269454,50,#1 in Hawaii,"As we do every year we took a friends trip with our families to Hualalai. This place is so special, so amazing, it just seems to get better each time we visit... 4 families with 6 kids and we had a blast. Kids spent the time swimming, watching turtles and spinner dolphins, flying kites, catching fish, crabs, and a baby eel, dancing hula and singing Hawaiian songs and eating too many desserts! The dads had a round of golf, and the moms had some time at the adults only swimming pool and bar. We always cab it from the airport because we never need or want to leave the property... If you can, request the ground floor units near the kids pool if you have little ones. The ground floor units also have the coolest outdoor showers! I also had some nice espresso at the trading company!",May 2017,May 2017,Traveled with family,,Honolulu

487989929,40,Very good,"This hotel is the best four seasons I went to, and way way way better than the wailea one. It is incredibly large, we cannot explore everything during our stay.    OK, now it's time for the problems. The staffs are generally professional, but sometimes feel robotic and lack the inspirations too work there. Are they underpayed?

487166518,50,Best resort in all of Hawaii,"The Four Seasons is an exceptional, unparalleled experience for peaceful luxury. The rooms and facilities are immaculate, and the secluded private resort is the perfect place to get away from it all. This is nothing like the luxury class resorts in Maui or Honolulu (or even other parts of the Big Island) that feel overrun and crowded. I can't recommend this hotel enough.

487213341,40,"Our ""Almost"" Perfect Hideaway",Very nice hotel - staff and services were excellent. Our only problem was that our room was upgraded to an ocean view from a partial ocean view and we could not see the ocean due to bushes blocking our view and access to the beach. It's okay because it was an upgrade but if I reserved an ocean view and got this room I would have been upset.,May 2017,May 2017,Traveled as a couple,,"Hilo, United States"

We didn't feel like we could relax and it took forever to get into our room. Although the room was nice and pretty clean, the carpets felt dirty.

487213403,50,Best All Around Stay,We stayed for our anniversary. We loved the restaurants and the relaxing around the infinity pool. The staff was fabulous and the location is unbeatable.

486618547,50,Luxury in Paradise,"While the Big Island of Hawaii may look like a moonscape from the airport and roads, it actually has 7 different climates on the island itself from desert to tropics.    The drive to the Four Seasons is a long winding county/highway road that takes you right through the lava fields from Kona to Kailua. Once you enter the gated property you are transported into a paradise of lush property with 2 golf courses and as many kinds of housing as you can imagine.    7 pools, a spa and exercise facility on par with a pro training camp, beaches, tide pools and lagoons meticulously maintained.    There is so much to do - or nothing at all - whatever you wish. The FS speaks for itself as refined luxury is embodied in paradise.",May 2017,May 2017,Traveled as a couple,,"Minneapolis, Minnesota"

486283441,50,So easy to recommend,"This is easily a 5 star resort. We have stayed in many resorts in Hawaii (all of the islands) and I feel it's safe to say that this Four Seasons is the finest resort we've ever stayed at (and that includes 4 seasons on other islands) There is literally nothing to like here. The grounds are gorgeous, and despite the size is quiet (we hung most at the quiet pool). The service is pretty much what you expect from Four Seasons--exceptional and pampering without being intrusive. Everyone is so pleasant to talk to , from the valets, to the registration desk, to the maids, the bartenders, cooks and wait staff.    We ate dinner at the resort 2 nights--the locales are just incredible--right on the beach feet from the water. Watch stunning sunsets while drinking wine and chowing down.    Get a downstairs room to have the outdoor shower which was a great change from the normal bathroom shower (there is an indoor one too if you must but we never used it)    The downside of course--no shocker here--bring your wallet. it is one of those instances that you do get what you pay for though. It was very difficult to leave!!!!! We'll be back in the future for sure.",May 2017,May 2017,Traveled as a couple,Take a downstairs room to get the outdoor shower!,"LosAngeles, CA"
486275355,50,Absolutely perfect!,"We stayed at the four seasons after reading all the reviews- and, as stated, it is absolutely fabulous. Everything was perfect- the food was outstanding. No matter how many changes you make to your order, they will get it right, and it will be wonderful. The snorkeling pond was the highlight of our visit. We safely snorkeled with an amazing and large array of fish - we actually did it twice, it was so wonderful. There turtles on the beach, outstanding pools for every taste (we went to two of them) - one for families and those who want to socialize and be loud, one that was a 'quiet' pool, and several others (that we never even made it to!) for adults only, lap swimming etc. Finally, the gym is outstanding- lots of classes and great equipment. We used the treadmill and elliptical- there were plenty available- never had to wait - and it was kept exceptionally clean. The concierge staff was never too busy to help us, and on mornings that we had to leave for a tour at the crack of dawn, there was complimentary coffee and pastries in the lobby. All in all, absolutely exceptional- we will be back!",May 2017,May 2017,Traveled as a couple,,"New York City, New York"
486266100,30,4 seasons Big Island Hawaii,"Was a beautiful place but for the price the beach left much to be desired. Hapuna Beach was 100x better.

485102276,50,Hawaii Four Seasons,"Outstanding venue, great golf course with good variety of holes and playing conditions  Pool areas, service much better than beaches with limited sand areas.

485081950,50,Beautiful but very expensive resort!,"In my circle of well traveled friends, everyone has raved about the FS Hualalai as one of the best resorts in the world, but I have always balked at the price point as you could take the money and do so much more than just the room rate. But on our 10th anniversary, i finally decided it was time to check it out - the hotel was just getting more and more expensive! So is it worth it? Well - like anything, it depends on what you are looking for. The resort is more like 4 resorts that are right next to each other, each with a pool or lagoon in front of it tied together - if walking far to get to lunch/dinner annoys you, then this is not your place (of course they will happily give you rides on a golf cart, but everything is spread out). There's a lagoon stocked with 40,000 fish and a manta - super cool and safe for young kids and not so confident swimmers which offers free snorkels and even floating viewer devices. There's a pool with a kids pool, there's a quiet pool and there's an adult pool each with their own set of two story rooms clustered around. The rooms are beautifully appointed - the outside shower is lovely plus for being on the ground floor. The spa is very nice and you can only use it if you are a hotel guest - but not anything incredible like you would find in Bali/thailand. We had dinner at the beach house - I'm surprised that the concierge would have suggested to go there for a 10 year anniversary dinner - we were surrounded by kids and families (it was fine for us, but not especially romantic) - it was expensive but fine - on average with any nice restaurant in the bay area for food quality. Breakfast was in Ulu which was $41 pp - the pastries were divine, but otherwise nothing entirely special except custom omelet station. What sets the hotel apart is the genuine service - everyone without fail smiles to greet you whatever they are doing. The pool staff seems to be scanning around to make sure everyone's needs are met (including all the freebies that everyone has mentioned). The atmosphere is very relaxed, but everything exudes carefully thought out luxury. So if you have the means to come here - you should definitely do it! However for $735+ entry point, there are definitely great hotels on the island (Lava Lava Beach Club, Mauna Kea, Fairmont) where you could stretch your dollars further and still have an amazing vacation as well.",May 2017,May 2017,Traveled as a couple,Either the lagoon or Adult Pool would be quiet,"Danville, California"
484780295,50,The absolute finest stay of my trip...,"This hotel complex is perhaps the finest hotel we've stayed in in the US. It is far superior to any hotel in the islands. It has absolutely phenomenal views of the volcano bowl, the ocean, the golf course... I simply cannot say enough good things about this place.

484516049,50,Worth it,"Some will complain about the prices and nit pick here or there. They're off base. If you can afford this, do it. What a privilege to experience. Luxury at its finest. Service at its best. Immaculate room. We had golf villa 3703, which is the farthest one, but it was perfect. I wouldn't pay more for any other regular room here. The golf rooms aren't really that far, have a little bit of ocean view, offer WAY more privacy, and have doorside self parking. Great value in my opinion. Everything here was just perfect. We kept pinching ourselves and talking about how amazing this property was.    Tips-  Golf view rooms, see above  Request a first floor room to get an outdoor shower  Twice weekly there is a free golf clinic which is basically a free semi private 30 minute lesson  Palm pool is great for swim up bar, but chairs are limited and it can get noisy  Free coffee in the morning in golf club and lobby (lobby has free croissants too)  Spa facilities are great and available even if not getting a treatment  Trading co is great for cheap quick breakfast or lunch (breakfast is otherwise $80++ for 2 people)  Trading co sells individual beers for 1/3 the price of the hotel  They provide sunscreen at all pools, you need not bring  Kings pond snorkel is a great activity for all ages  Sunset at beachtree with live music    Food-  Ulu breakfast is fantastic. You can skip lunch given how great the buffet is. The pastries are especially good. Ulu dinner is very good, albeit quite pricey for what it is. Beachtree dinner is delicious (fresh pastas highly recommended) and having Italian is a nice break from all the Hawaiian regional food...and the live music is aweso me. Lunch at Beachtree also good - pizza was very good as was the skirt steak. Poolside I loved the poke bowls. Expensive at $30 but they give a really good portion of fish.

483987445,50,An elevated Hawaiian experience,"I typically stay away from Four Seasons hotels because in my experience they do not embrace the local cultures in their design as much as I would like to see and instead just provide a snooty, over-priced, marble-filled, safe haven for rich people, but this was an exception. The design was understated yet elegant, relaxed and really honored the island and its surroundings. The beach front & hotel grounds were absolutely incredible, the restaurants are impressive and the gym was on another level for a hotel. The gym's weight area had a squat rack and had also cardio areas both outdoors & indoors, none of which I have seen in any hotel. Our water-view room was very comfortable, spacious and had a beautiful view of the beach and adult-only pool. They even had their own large snorkeling pool with tons of fish. There is really no reason to leave the resort other than for local attractions like the volcano and observatory. My only gripe would be the $21 cocktails and the $7 price of an extra egg on the breakfast menu, but this is typical for a hotel of this level.",May 2017,May 2017,Traveled as a couple,get a room by the adult pool if you don't have kids,"Babylon, New York"

The special gifts and treats were such a nice surprise and made our trip that much more special. She was so helpful with anything we needed at any point which made even getting a unexpected prescription picked up no big deal and I could continue on our vacation without a stop. Her help also setting up our excursions I know made a difference as well. Having a snorkeling trip on a private boat really impressed my husband who felt like he was in heaven and I know I would have never found or set up such an amazing time without her. All of the staff at Hualalai were amazing from the people who picked us up from the air port Edwin, to those who helped with our luggage, brought our food to our room, spa staff, waiters, cooks and more.

482746454,50,Worth it,"A friend and I planned a week at Hualalai as a splurgey celebration. Given the price point, we were worried that it might not live up to our high expectations, especially when we read some reviews from travellers who had been returning for years and were not happy recently. For us, it lived up to our expectations and then some.    Straight up, my friend and I are high maintenance with a few special needs (she is recovering from cancer treatments). Hualalai had no problem meeting our demands and being pleasant in the process. Jane, in reservations, was fantastic, cheerful, and managed to secure us the best room on the property, at least as far as we were concerned. Chenin, in Recreation, helped us with cabana reservations, and ensuring that where we spent most of our time between lunch and sunset would be comfortable.    Alicia, Jake, and Drew at the Beach Tree Pool were super nice and so much fun - can't say enough good things about them. And any reviews mentioning lack of free water must not realize that they are now filtering water rather than offering in bottles. We were constantly offered glasses and refills of water, so that was not a problem. And Theresa came by every day with gratis cool Evian mist, frozen fruit, adult popsicles, and aloe, so we felt that the resort was really spending the effort to make our pool time enjoyable.    Also, a special shout out to housekeeping, who did a remarkable job tidying the room and attending to our requests. Denise, especially, really took care of us during our stay.    Finally, Heather and Jenn in the shops were super helpful and friendly, recommending items to our taste, but not letting us buy anything that didn't suit us. They even offered to email us photos of new inventory from our Favorites brands.    In short, we would stay again in a heart beat.    Tips:    - room preferences are noted but cannot be guaranteed, but if you go during less busy periods (e.g., before or after major holidays and school breaks), you stand a much better chance of getting what you want    - book an upper floor room for a better view and less foot traffic; if you are tempted by an outdoor shower, know that they are all bamboo-covered    - get a poolside massage from Michelle, who is so kind, and will make you feel like your bones are pudding    - enjoy at least one night of room service on your deck, which is much better than the standard room service fare    - all the restaurants were good, but the Grille (steak house) was our food favourite; Jason took good care of us    - at the resident restaurant (I can't remember the name, but hotel guests can request dinner reservations to be confirmed by 3pm day of), try to sit in Mikaela's section, who is an absolute joy    - make restaurant reservations in advance (up to two weeks ahead), even during slower periods, especially if you want a sunset booking (6:30pm, year round); that said, we enjoyed sunset on our deck, with our own bottle of wine, and a later dinner, which gave us more pool time and fewer crowds at the restauarant",May 2017,April 2017,,,"Seattle, Washington"
482710571,50,A slice of Paradise,"This is probably my favorite Four Seasons resort. The rooms are beautifully appointed...ours was a lower level ocean view with chaise lounges for private relaxation. There are several pools to choose from including an adult only with swim up bar or one that is family oriented. Or sit only steps away on the beach. There is a breakwater that allows for ocean swimming with less tidal action....good for children and less confident swimmers. There are turtles that often come right up onto the beach to sun. The grounds are filled with tropical flowers and plants, well manicured and tended. The staff is attentive and cater to your every whim...in Four Season style. Of course, there is a full service spa; however, I can't on the services as we did not use it.

Upon arrival, we were greeted with a cold towel and drink. The greeter remembered us from last year and he was friendly and nice. We spent our day hanging around the pools. There is sunscreen and leave in conditioner available for use but the pool I was at was out of sunscreen for many hours. Do try the restaurants on the property, each one is great! To the north side of the property beach, there are turtles that come to shore. The Kings Pond has plenty of fish and an eagle ray to snorkel with. The spa and fitness centers are also amazing!

482515762,50,A wonderful adventure!,"We chose Hualalai as our base to adventure the Big Island from, and it served its purpose wonderfully! The Big Island has a very unique landscape and as you drive into Hualalai from the airport it is a blur of volcanic rock, but upon driving through the gates and making your way to the Four Seasons entrance the true beauty of the property is revealed. The property has a multitude of pools, beaches, activities and dining spots, all stretched out along the oceanside. We had a fantastic stay at this relaxing spot away from it all.  Tips:  - Breakfast everyday is great, with an extensive buffet.  - Ulu is definitely tops as far as restaurant choices go, well ahead of the others.  - We got a golf course view room to save a couple (hundred) $$$, which turned out to be lovely, private, and the views were beautiful (down the 18th fairway with a healthy slice of ocean behind). The room also had (free) parking immediately outside which was great because we had rented a car to tour the island with.  - Expect to spend $$$ on drinks, dining, and off-property activities. Be aware that any meal on property is going to run you (couple) north of $100, with dinners being more like $2-300+.  - The concierge were fantastic and very thorough (Samantha was one of the best we've ever come across)",May 2017,April 2017,Traveled as a couple,Saved some money with a golf course view room.

Be sure to get a room that overlooks the ocean, or you miss out on a lot of the experience. Take time to just relax by the main pool, I'd skip the adult pool.

480436251,20,What I wish I had known...,"It pains me to write this but I agree with the many reviewers who have expressed disappointment with this property. I wanted to stay at Hualalai for years before our schedules and hotel availability finally coincided. Unfortunately the experience was a very expensive disappointment. I rarely write reviews but I wish I had been convinced to stay elsewhere when planning our trip. Here are my two cents for others making their own decisions-    Pros:  *Rooms- Bed and pillows were comfortable, room was quiet. We slept well. Light and temperature control were good. My husband loved the huge television. The fridge had room for leftovers and drinks. We enjoyed our location near the King's Pond.  *Beautiful grounds. Gorgeous sunsets.  *The staff are friendly and accommodating, but you have to ask for everything (housekeeping, a waitress, your next drink, robes for the room, etc.)  *We received a nice welcome for our celebration.    Cons:  *The property is extremely worn. Chairs and pads are faded and peeling, room technology is old and minimal. Stained chair pads and plastic tables stacked on the beach. Rooms look dated. Our room had a patio area with a round shaped double lounge that was supposed to have a retractable cover but it was broken off.  *Room rates are exorbitant relative to the current state of the property.  *We weren't told that we could use the spa facilities at any time so we missed out on them until our last day. (Lack of communication of amenities.)  *Spa is nothing spectacular indoors but has a lovely, although small, area outside. While I was showering there was some kind of construction (jackhammering) going on above or beside me...definitely not what you want immediately following your massage.  *The lights in our outdoor lava shower were out, another detail that emphasized the lack of maintenance and upkeep around the property. Repair wasn't completed until our last night.  *Limited dining/entertainment options. Restaurants were packed and service was extremely slow.  *We had to call to have housekeeping come make up our room when it hadn't been done by 3pm. We never did receive the beach bag that was supposed to be in the room 'for use during your stay.'    We are frequent travelers. We've stayed at the unbelievable FS Bora Bora in overwater bungalows with butlers who knew our names, what we wanted for breakfast, and our favorite drinks for half the price of a stay at Hualalai. We've stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa Village and enjoyed the huge lagoon filled with fish and sea turtles, abundant restaurants and entertainment, and charming canal boats for a tenth of the price of a stay at Hualalai. We've stayed at the One & Only Palmilla and been spoiled rotten by personal butlers, private outdoor spa rooms beyond your wildest dreams, breathtaking grounds and ocean views, absolutely pristine rooms and resort furnishings, and fantastic restaurants for a quarter of the price of a stay at Hualalai. Sadly, our visit to Hualalai reminded me how much I love all these other places.    There are so many options for spending your vacation time and money. Unfortunately, in our opinion, Hualalai does not provide the luxury experience commensurate to the luxury price tag.",May 2017,January 2017,Traveled as a couple,,"Las Vegas, Nevada"
480414186,30,Stay at Hualalai,"Beautiful grounds, lovely rooms, some friendly staff. However, checking in was a slow process, Beach Tree restaurant dinner the first night was not tasty and not worth the cost. Ulu restaurant dinner the next evening was of much better quality. The first day, one of the main pools (one encouraged for children to use) was closed because of an earlier ""incident""...most guests knew what that meant. I had problems locating and getting my children checked into the Hualalai Kids Camp when I had a scheduled spa appointment. I was nearly late getting to my appointment. This was very frustrating, the procedures for the Kids Camp was not clearly explained when I inquired about it at check-in. In addition, certain pools have rules, such as no jumping in (or splashing) as well as acceptable noise level. These rules also was not clearly defined (or explained) at check-in. Which resulted in my children getting reprimanded by pool staff. This is a great place for couples on a honeymoon. However, it is definitely not a child friendly resort even though they advertise to be.",Apr 2017,April 2017,Traveled with family,,Hilo
480100290,50,Found it! Heaven on earth!,"Wow! Just Wow! There is nothing about this property that is not spectacular, perfect and a total indulgence!  The greeting that guests receive is beyond reproach, being called by name as you step foot out of the cab. The registration process is relaxed and comfortable with a cool towel and cocktail and tropical snack to start the adventure!  You are whisked to your room by a very knowledgable bellman in a buggy that provides a quick tour of the nearest pools and amenities. The room was lovely - it was part of the environment, not fighting it. The bathroom extends beyond the shower to an outdoor shower set in tropical plants! There is a beautiful terrace to sip cocktails or eat breakfast as we did each morning.  The service is beyond great, the staff at all levels make the one of the best destinations in the world. We ate at all their restaurants and all are superb. The highlight was the Resident's Cottage, not only was it the best menu, the staff were fabulous, Micah and Vince making us feel just the way one should in Hawaii!  Alessandro, whom we had met at the weekly manager's reception checked on our well being regularly and was a true gentleman. Patrick was a delightful host whilst Thomas spoilt us with 2 bespoke soufflés to celebrate our 25th Wedding anniversary. Very special people.  Summer at the concierge desk knows more than anyone about the property and the area than anyone having been a part of it since the opening 20 years ago! Krystal from the Spa overheard that I had some issues with my back and arranged very discretely for and acupuncturist to visit the Spa and treat me.  The Hualalai Golf Course is superb, challenging from the longer tees and very playable form the front. The pro shop is well stocked and reasonably priced. The staff are fantastic, Stephen loading your bags takes care of all your needs, Brown Bear is one of the Hawaiian treasures you sometimes find, caring and interested in you. The highlight has to be Sid on the drinks cart, he made our many rounds so memorable, showing up at the best photo ops and having drinks ready for us several times through the round. His cookies at halfway are worth a stop!  There is no denying you pay for this heavenly experience but this is what a luxury vacation is meant to be like and you can see where every last cent went!

479862452,50,The Best of the Best,"Not only is this my favorite Four Seasons, FS Hualalai is my favorite hotel in the world. It has everything I expect for the FS - great customer service, food, and beautiful accommodations. What sets this hotel apart from the other FS in Hawaii is the vast number of activities. If you live a healthy lifestyle this is the place for you. I enjoyed daily yoga and spin classes as well as long runs on their jogging paths that weave along the ocean through lava rock and then through the gardens to the golf course. Another huge plus, multiple self-service laundry rooms stocked with detergent, stain remover, and dryer sheets. Such a convenience to be able to wash smelly clothes as no cost.    If you are considering a FS, use a preferred partner to get great perks. I loved working with Richie at WhataHotel.com. I received complimentary breakfast each day and a $100 F&B credit. I have never used a travel agency before, but I called them to talk about FS Hualalai.

477276408,30,"Used to be top notch, now is average and not worth the cost.","We were blown away the first time we came to this resort 7 years ago! Then we had our wedding week extravaganza for 70 people which was incredible and top notch. In recent years, the management has changed and so has the quality of the resort overall. Lately, we have received much better service at resorts that are rated less luxurious than the Hualalai.  Two years in a row we have had our spring break trip reservation requests either ignored or modified against our wishes at the last minute. They apologized the first time, but did nothing about it. The second year they also apologized and said they could do nothing about it. I had called over 6 months in advance and received confirmation that our rooms were adjacent. They even admitted that they, against policy, had promised us adjacent rooms. After a couple hours of condescending and patronizing conversation in which they repeatedly said we were not being reprioritized they proved our point and chose to reprioritize someone else. If we hadn't ""gone to the mat"" for two hours we would have been left with the least of all our options. Even still we weren’t able to be next to our kids.  The food is just ok. It used to be really excellent and now ebbs and flows depending on who’s working--I would say the food for the pool and beach service is downright terrible and you are better off getting food ""off campus"". Several times we were served drinks and food that was actually disgusting.  The resort does have a kids club and fun kids pool, but you can spend less money at other resorts and have that as well.  There is the occasional staff member we encountered that was truly excellent and exceeded expectations (a girl serving food on the beach and a couple of others). Those few exhibited the level of service that the resort as a whole used to exhibit, but no longer does.  The views are truly beautiful as it is right on the beach, but there isn't much sand at all so if you are looking for true beach I would seek out another option. We used to come here mainly because the service was so good and it felt like a more authentic Hawaii experience than other resort hotels--now I wouldn't make that claim at all.",Apr 2017,April 2017,Traveled with family,,"Encinitas, California"

475863782,30,Used to be the best,Can't argue with the view. It's amazing. But I expected a lot better than what they delivered. For the rates they charge I expect food quality and options that far exceed what I can produce on my own or can easily obtain off property. I would probably stay in a house in the future. But if you're looking for a Heinz ketchup kind of experience and aren't too concerned about the food then you'll love it. Lots of things for kids to do. Their kids room has tons of games. And their snorkel pond is fun. I'm not a big fan of their adult pool that doesn't have any bathrooms nearby but has a swim up bar. You know what that means.... The beach could use more sand and less coral. Getting in and out is very painful. But I like that they remove all the spiky creatures from their ocean pool.

475660755,50,Choose where your room is carefully,"This is a first class place for a family holiday, especially for younger children. Our daughter is 7 and it was perfect for her. The highlight for her was definitely the Kings Pool, a pool which is open between 10.00 and 16.00 for snorkeling.    The Kings Pool is well stocked with reef fish of all sizes and an eagle ray. It's a sort of swimming pool with sheltered seating for small groups around the edge. The beach hut with complementary flippers, masks and pipes is on a sand beach increasing in depth in the lava rock surround to about 5m. My daughter learned to snorkel here and this is where she wanted to go every day, especially a eagle ray feeding time. This is where Daddy became a powerful athlete and diver in her eyes. That, no doubt, will change!    Kings Pool is one of four semi crescent room clusters, each with a different personality. The two at either end are by far the quietest with the center two having the main beach restaurants and pools. The turtle resting areas are at either end of the beach where the two quieter clusters are to be found. Like the turtles, we preferred these areas.    This is a golf club resort hotel with all that entails. If you want to compete with America's leading floor tile salesmen, then the two center crescents are a good place to do that.    We love this hotel and were recommended to it by friends who stayed here many times. Our daughter will always remember it.

475337011,30,Paradise...Not Found,"I don't really know how to even begin to describe my experience at the Four Seasons Hualalai so I will start on a positive note.  Pro. The staffs are AMAZING. They are ever so helpful and very efficient ..and that's it really .  We are a mixed race gay couple and I did feel like we gate crashed into a Fraterniry/Sorority pool party where we didn't really belong and nor would we have wanted to belong. It's a Ralph Lauren catalog from 1990s.  The resort itself is about 4 star . We have been to resorts in the Maldives so this property is just a regular resort on the beach to be honest . The beach itself is not swimmable .It's built on lava rocks so I do have tp wear beach shoes and mind where you are swimming when the current is strong which is usually most of the time.  The famous Kings Pond did look good on paper . We were looking forward to it but in reality it is a depressing site . It's like a petting zoo for children who want to experience sea creatures in their unnatural habitat . The pond is man made and there is one stingray that you can schedule an appointment to feed it etc . In the Maldives you are surrounded by sea lives who roam free around your water villa so for me the Kings pond was like a DisneySea for children but on a much smaller scale. Personally if I had a child I would want my child to see how sea creatures live in their natural habitats or learn about their evolutions etc at The Natural History Museum.  The resort is geared towards families with children . It was out fault really that we stupidly booked it without doing much research. We are a couple who value our privacy and we definitely did not get that here . I actually wanted to leave after the first night but my boyfriend stopped me since we had paid for the rooms in advance .  Now the restaurants. There are several but we mostly ate at the Ulu Grill.We tried the Beach Tree for lunch and a dinner and it was awful. At the Ulu Grill where the sashimi and nigiri are good they have a Thai waitress and she took care of us and was very nice and kind . She also told us that she didn't and couldn't speak or understand any Thai and that she had only caucasian friends. Need I say more? She was nice but I wanted to tell her that this is 2017 and it's OK to have multi cultural friends . It might broadens her horizon a little bit.  They have a cafe/ gift shop called The Trading Company where we usally ate out lunches. 2 chicken paninis / 1 chicken Caesar salad 2 big bottles of water, a croissant and a mixed berry bowl = $77. Yes indeedy.  All in all We spent $8000 + on Disneyland Hawaii and it's not the resort's fault . I placed the blame solemn myself for thinking that this is a super exclusive luxury resort akin to the ones I had been to around the world ( see my other reviews ) and it's not . For me this is a luxury resort from the early 90s . It has that kind of vibe .  We stayed in a Premier Ocean Front Room at 1500++ a night(n we stayed for 4 nights ) including breakfast which was not good. The staffs at breakfast were great but the food was not .

Now, was it $1500 a day great....well again if that does not bother you then yes, it is worth it. But candidly we have stayed at other places less expensive and have enjoyed it equally as well.

473199931,20,Do not book for night arriving from mainland,"Flights are delayed. Flights are canceled. It happens. Regularly. At $1200+ per night every hour late is a real cost to the traveler. This property will only give credit for only this property to be used within 6 months. For a family traveling from the east coast popping over to Kona, Hawaii another time is not feasible. Ideally a credit for the Four Seasons chain would be outstanding customer service. However, this property is not a real Four Seasons and can only give credit for only this property. And the airlines couldnt care less about lost time or expense travelers incur.    Lesson learned--book a low cost hotel for first two nights on any Hawaiian island. Dont risk travel problems (American Airlines) where you the traveler take 100% of the travel risk. Flying is wrought with problems. The chances are reasonably high you will have a problem. This time it was the fault of ""air traffic control"" in LA.

472646243,40,Amazing location and relaxing resort,"My daughter and I traveled for a few days following a family wedding to relax and enjoy the beauty of the island. This resort provides amazing views and lots of options for relaxation so you would never have to leave the resort. However we wanted to see the island as well. Ahead of our stay the concierge was very responsive and set up tours for us. We had also arranged a picnic lunch but fortunately I called to confirm the night before and there was no order on file so they quickly fixed this so we would not be stuck the next day but it was tad disappointing to have missed that detail. Check-in was poor in our experience as we were made to wait on a couch for 30 minutes while they ""found"" someone to check us in. I had to check at the desk several times as it did not seem that anyone knew we were there. Honestly we felt like we were an afterthought. When someone did arrive he was rushed and kept telling me that it wasn't his fault but that check in was very busy. OK so you are a resort and probably know how many guests are arriving and when....The decision to do this ""personalized"" greeting was the resorts. If you aren't able to meet that expectation then perhaps a rethink is in order rather than making guests feel they are an inconvenience. That said the staff were otherwise outstanding and welcoming. It is indeed a large a busy resort with lots of families. You need to make reservations for dinner early on property as they do book up. One final thing, it would be nice not to be told repeatedly how ""authentic"" the experience is by staff. In my experience authentic speaks for itself and we have experienced this many times on Hawaii without being told. Overall a truly luxurious resort and very comfortable rooms. Restaurants were superb and in room dining was spot on and timely.

I came back once pretty late to find my room wasnt cleaned. Another time dirty towels in the corner werent removed. Another time all my empty cups and old drinks not removed.

One of the things that's so great about all Four Seasons resorts, is that they always solve any issue, and with a smile. If you ask someone a question, and it's not their job, they will help solve it none the less. If you are lost, they take the time to personally walk you where you are going. They never re-direct you to find the solution your self. Even things you didn't know you needed, but are nice touches: do you need your sunglasses cleaned? 3pm at the kids pool: someone comes around with Popsicles. Little touches like this add so much.

The size allows the guests to spread out so while the resort was fully booked it never felt crowded. There is a kid's pool which had a lot of families. We spent most of our time at the adult pool which allows kids but just no playing. The pool is gorgeous, almost Olympic size, salt water. Food and drinks by the pool is excellent. We also had massages by the pool which were really great. There is a whole contained snorkeling area which had 4000 fish and was a ton of fun; kids loved it. Go early as later in the day it gets murkier from everyone snorkeling. We had turtles who came up and rested on the beach. The Resident Inn was excellent especially for lunch. Breakfast at Ulu was great as was the lunches and dinners we had at the Beach club. You get amazing sunsets there too. We did a Luau one night which was hokey but wanted to take the kids to one. We really had a great stay here. All our needs were taken care of. Very helpful concierge as well. We had a truly lovely and memorable vacation.

Golf moved quickly and the course was nicely kept up. The spa was beautiful with an outdoor area with steam room, sauna and whirlpool. We had so much fun snorkeling at the King's pond. I usually feel uncomfortable snorkeling in the ocean but the pond was so calm and the set up made it easy to be comfortable. Our buffet breakfasts were lovely as was our dinner at Ulu.

Guests are greeted by name all over the property, children are welcomed with enthusiasm, food is outstanding, amenities, spa, activities, etc. just can't be beat.

The team at the Four Seasons Hualali handles situations with integrity, and manages to build customer loyalty at the same time.

A quite pol, which is mostly teenagers on their phones. Then there is where my kids hung out a general pool. My wife and I had a morning of stand up paddle boarding. Kids had a blast in Kids for All Seasons Camp. Then as parents we had a chance to golf. Also went on an all-day helicopter trip across the island and a day spent on the ground in Volcano National Park. The helicopter tour was a great experience for the kids. The volcano was active and we saw good amount of lava flowing. It was a blast. The meals were awesome. We went a few weeks before it got really busy from spring break – would recommend making dinner reservations. We had meals at Grille, Beachtree and Ulu. All good food, but I wish I had more evenings at Ulu, but due to reservations, the only times available were 8:30 p.m.. Ulu has a nice selection and sushi and Asian Fusion cuisine.    I need to workout. There is a little over 4.5 mile loop around the property. Run early in the morning. There is a nice gym. There is lots of equipment – there is never a lack of availability.

467993911,50,An oasis of paradise within paradise,"We just had our 2nd stay at the Four Seasons, Hualalai and we understand why people are such fans of and so passionate about this resort.    As Big Island residents we're used to all of the island being beautiful, have stayed in various accommodations on all the islands with accommodations, and have visited or dined at many others, including at some of the higher end resorts. There really isn't anything else like this! The layout of the property is wonderful. Without large buildings, and with what is basically perfect, elegant landscaping, just walking around the property gives a feeling that isn't experienced at other luxury resorts. It feels much more like being in a little village. It never feels crowded or hurried. As travelers we aren't really resort types, preferring to venture out all day and generally returning to our accommodations to sleep. After staying here, now we get it. It was just wonderful to be there and it truly felt like we'd been transported somewhere else other than the already beautiful island we live on, yet still felt very much like the Hawaii we know and love. At night it takes on another character. Dim, but enough lighting everywhere gave it a tranquil feel. Even the restaurants become pleasant glows which fade as you walk away.    The rooms we stayed in were spacious, beautiful, with a very comfortable bed and probably the best pillows I've experienced. Obviously the housekeeping is top notch. Super clean and no signs of wear anywhere. Luxurious and comfortable, while understated and nothing in or out of the rooms felt pretentious. As someone who generally dislikes air conditioning, largely because of the loud sounds or overly strong blowing that's inescapable, I found it to be almost miraculous here. Super quiet and it just works. Some of the rooms have outdoor showers in addition to indoor shower and separate tub. The outdoor shower is spectacular! We never heard other guests within our room so it felt very private and quiet. Even the least expensive rooms were nicer than anywhere else we've stayed.    Food everywhere was very good to excellent and there were an above average number of vegan and vegetarian options indicated and/or listed on separate menus. This was actually one of the reasons we stayed here the first time for our honeymoon. We also loved the spa, the clothing store, and the trading company with some very rare, highly-rated pour over Big Island coffees that I had read about and had been wanting to try.    Being the closest resort to the airport and Kailua-Kona town, the location is ideal but still far enough away from all of that to be an oasis. There are small beaches in front of the property, and larger ones a little bit of a walk north and south. The Big Island doesn't generally have the massive beaches found on Maui, Kauai, and Oahu so the small beach there is actually more than some other Kona/Kohala resorts. The pools are all so nice with such great views of the ocean that we spent more time around them. For those into hiking, it's not too far from what I consider one of the most spectacular hiking destinations in Hawaii, Kiholo Bay.    Service was also excellent, friendly, always professional.    This place is very special. Even just having this place to visit a few hours drive from our home made us feel like we were on vacation somewhere new while we were there.    Even if you've been to Hawaii before, it's in its own class here and even a couple nights it will probably be the highlight of your visit. For kama'aina looking for a special escape, I can't think of a more impressive place to stay for a special occasion or luxurious staycation.",Mar 2017,March 2017,Traveled as a couple,We were happy to be in the area closest to the adults only pool,"New York City, New York"

465880356,40,"Lovely property, great staff but rooms need updating","We spent 3 weeks in Hawaii in February staying at the Four Seasons Oahu, FS Maui and FS Hualalai. Overall, FS Hualalai was our favorite hotel, with FS Oahu being second.    Stayed 10 days in total at Hualalai and although this is our favorite Four Seasons in Hawaii, we feel there are a few things about the property that have become less than ideal - considering the minimum $1000 price tag for rooms at this time of year.    Here are the wonderful things we continue to love:    1) Property: super peaceful and serene during early February and the overall feeling of being in a really special place. There is really nothing similar in Hawaii as far as the hotel grounds and architecture goes.    2) Staff: the staff are really there to please and over the years we have really bonded with many of them. In some ways it feels like family and for this we are grateful.    3) Housekeeping: Celeste) does an amazing job and looks after all our room needs. She arrived on time every day at 10 (which is our preference).    4) Room Service: Room service breakfast this time around was really excellent, and Rocky who delivered the breakfast every morning was truly a kind and caring employee.    5) Beach Tree Bar staff: continue to be exemplary staff and a lovely place to watch the sun set, and have dinner. It's doesn't make sense for us to try and find a quiet area in the dinning room, still no tables for two set off to themselves, always surronded by large groups, so we have resigned ourselves to the bar area. Thanks to the bar staff: Geoff, Jessie, Juliet, Greg, Frank, Tahanni, Mike, Laurentu, Brent. Also thanks to Doug at U'lu!    Some things that weren't up to par this time around:    1) The rooms are looking tired and dated with a malfunctioning fridge/dresser door combo, worn carpet, outdated bathrooms. (look at FS Maui and FS Oahu for inspiration).    2) Too many corporate groups takes away from the sophistication and exclusivity of the resort. (and take over the bar and dinning rooms on certain nights.)    3) Beach Tree and U'lu dinner prices have sky-rocketed, and the food quality or execution does not match the price.    4) Hotel management are no longer to be seen. There was once a time when the resort manager, director or assistant director of rooms, restaurant managers, pool managers would walk around and talk to guests. This wasn't the case during our 10 day stay.(with the exception of beach tree restaurant)    5) Limited personal recognition of customer loyalty. After giving the valet my name he asked if it was our first time to the hotel. After our 8th visit, it would be nice to have some staff recognition at check in. Front desk staff seemed to lack warmth, seemed to be on auto pilot, at both check in and check out. We were there last year for two weeks, I guess it doesn't occur to them to check the list of people checking in that day. also, the little extra room amenities are long gone. we used to get bottles of wine or trays of chocolates. not anymore. this is vastly different from European Four Seasons properties that leave bottles of champagne, pastries, etc., almost on a nightly basis.    Overall, if going during the off season, this might be worth it, but with increasing February rates, and unattractive rooms, we are going to take some time off.",Mar 2017,February 2017,Traveled as a couple,,"Toronto, Ontario"
465974689,40,Great hotel let down by the small niggles,"We loved our stay , however some things really left bad tastes in our mouths. Firstly one night we wanted to dine at the residents restaurant myself and my family were made to feel totally unwelcome and were almost turned away (this was then the restaurant was totally empty 5:35pm) We checked in advance if we needed a booking and were told no so we turned up and were told it was fully booked, not sure of the persons name who gave the bad service but she had 3 stars tattooed behind her ear or on her upper neck (only 2 tables were taken , I counted over 20 empty tables) I then mentioned about the no booking conversation earlier and was told ""okay then I guess we can seat you but you can't seat in the normal seats"" and was made to sit in what can only be described as the naughty seats. These were blue deck chair type seats with no shade and no ""proper"" table to eat from in fact my 6yr old daughter had to eat her food resting her plate on a wooden log it was either that or rest her plate on her lap. We also had to switch chairs between us about 4-5 times as my family was getting burnt by the sun. We were told they were fully booked but at the time of us leaving there were still almost 20 empty tables (18 to be exact exactly as I counted them) . All the while residents were passing by and being greeted (you can tell who they are as they arrive in the golf carts) with ""do you think you'll be joining us tonight?"" ""come on in we have lots of seating for you"" I get that the staff speak and meet with the residents far more than they do with guests but holding back tables for them and treating them as top tier customers while treating the hotel guests as nuisances is just bad form and not to be expected. The other really bad thing was the super slow internet , and then the charge of $25.00 per night if I wanted to actually have usable speed. (they provide dial up speeds of between 400 and 700K with an average speed of 512K for free yep that's less than 1meg speed ) Considering the cost of the resort I expect fast internet to be included. and not have to pay over $100 during my stay to something that should have been free. Now on the plus side and there are many of them I would like to specifically call out some amazing staff. Firstly the ladies at the cultural center who went out of their way to ensure we had a memorable stay , nothing was too much for them . Next is Craig at Kings pond who again made our time there fun and is a really nice guy. All of the Kids club staff who my daughter adored. I've still rated the service as Very good in my rating as 1 incident although concerning didn't take away from the great atmosphere of the place. I would go back again , and there is a big difference between the four seasons and other hotels that we visited in Hawaii Gran Waileia and Hilton but for me it's a treat and not a every year thing. Is it worth the more than $1.5K a night that's their average cost , I guess it depends on what your expecting for your money, It doesn't compare to some of the half the price of this place Maldives or Dubai hotels I've stayed in but it is nice, and manages well to be a place for switching off while still keeping families entertained.",Mar 2017,February 2017,Traveled with family,,"Seattle, Washington"

We spent 2 nights at Four Seasons and also got info from Hualalai Realty.    We were greeted by the friendliest of staff with leis and a refreshing cool towel. We got an in-person walk through of the resort facilities. Brief but helpful. Our luggage was quickly and efficiently transferred to our room.    Our guest room (which included an outdoor lava rock garden shower) was wonderful, from the showers to the beds (which were the most comfortable I had ever slept in at a resort). We were only a few steps from the pools, beaches, restaurants, golf, etc.    We golfed at the private course and had the whole course to ourselves. The course was impeccable. The staff were friendly and helpful.    The service was the best!! Congrats to all the staff. You can be proud.    We ate at several 5 star restaurants while in Oahu and the Big Island. ULU was our best meal.    We lounged by the pools and had our choice of cabanas either beach or poolside. Staff set up the cabana for us.    The Four Seasons has the best of everything you would expect in a resort.    We booked through TravelSort. Hilary was great. The package included breakfast, $100 credit, and free room upgrade. We liked our room so much we passed on the upgrade. Hilary gifted us with some wonderful choclates. Four Seasons had a great bottle of champagne and a goumet serving of cheeses/fruit waiting four us.    Only tiny blemish was plumbing in lava shower was a bit tricky. But it worked.

The room was nice enough, I expected a few more modern upgrades in the actual room, but it was good enough for the amount of time we spent there, and the housekeeping team did a fabulous job. We spent every morning and ended every evening on the room's deck, it was a wonderful experience having a lanai. You go to Hualalai for the resort grounds and pools, which are wonderful. Our particular room was close to some of the maintenance facilities, which let me see a little bit of 'how the sausage is made,' but the upside is that we saw how hard they work at keeping the resort running. Each of the pools are amazing, with top-notch service. You will want for nothing as you relax. We loved all of the restaurants, especially Beach Tree on a Wednesday night. The fitness center has great classes, we started every day there, and it seemed like everyone else in the resort did too. Hualalai attracts beautiful, heath-centric people, so it's easy to stay on track with fitness goals while on vacation here. The spa is also a must-visit while there. I also loved the resort boutique. You could show up with an empty suitcase and be good to go.    We've stayed at a few places on Kona and Maui, and this is by far the best hotel on the islands. Run, do not walk, to this resort.

The hotel is huge, I know they have a more than 5 pools. Most of the rooms are two story building with 8 rooms. My room was on the second level because I had chosen ocean view, but I walked around and if you choose a garden view I think they don't have too much privacy.

The hotel’s small beach for swimming may leave you disappointed, but the island of Hawaii is really not known for its sandy beaches. The fitness facility is nothing short of spectacular and it is certainly the nicest of any hotel operation I have visited. Given what is on offer, I can’t see how anyone could be disappointed. There are a number of restaurants on premises and the Beach Tree Grill was our favorite. Watching the sunset from it’s veranda as the live nightly music gets under way is memorable. We stayed in an ocean view room looking out over the King’s pond and found the room amply sized. The bed was comfortable and the custom toiletries were extremely gentle and subtly fragranced. The one issue we had with the room is that a level of disrepair existed which we have never encountered in a Four Seasons Hotel. Pieces of shingles dropped from the roof above our door and usually sat on our porch the entire day. Paint was peeling on many parts of the deck and areas of the bathroom floor and shower were in need of resealing.

460172737,50,"Excellent Location, Terrific Staff","It is a good sign to see seasoned visitors accustomed to luxury repeatedly return. Such is the case for the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai. They clearly have been doing something right for decades.    Its two greatest strengths are its location and its team. Strong but less compelling are the restaurants which benefit from their beautiful beachfront location but perhaps could improve their solid if not stellar menus. The physical plant though two decades old is nonetheless in fine condition.    The resort is favored by families and it is easy to see why. The hotel offers options for each age group: golf, swimming, snorkeling (including in a protected lagoon with fish and rays), kids' crafts which emphasize Hawaiian heritage (e.g. making bracelets with seashells).    Surfing and bodysurfing are theoretically feasible though not ideal on site -- I've only seen the rare local out front of the hotel. However, the concierge can arrange excellent offsite options, including lessons, (35 - 60 minutes drive depending on traffic).    a) Location    The property is well-sited on a rocky promontory with a man-made and sheltered sandy beach. Over the years the property has become surrounded by low-density residential developments which abut the hotel golf course. This has added some competition for resources. Some reviewers report jockeying or inability to get beach or pool chairs. We never experienced this although we got to the beach before 10 am.    b) Staff    Knowledgeable and attentive as one would expect of Four Seasons staff. This was the case throughout the property. They are simply world class.    c) Restaurants    We enjoyed the two beachside restaurants and probably found their ocean and sunset views their greatest feature.    d) Pools    These are excellent and large. Thoughtfully, one pool area is designed with children in mind while another pool area is designed for a quieter adult experience. Those who are serious about swimming can do so at the gym pool.

The pools are nice, and the 'lagoon' to swim in is nice...but if you're into surfing or anything like that the beach there doesn't have much to offer you would have to travel elsewhere.  The fitness area is a strange set up with equipment in 3 different buildings and there isn't much space.  Our room had almost a stale, old musty smell to it which was a little off putting. The outdoor shower is a waste, nothing really appealing about showering out there at all. We had a 9 month old baby with us that would crawl around the room frequently and after crawling his knees and toes would be black, leaving us to wonder how clean it really was.

When we arrived there was a giant sea turtle chilling on the beach - it was so perfect it was like they had the turtle on payroll. One of the coolest parts was the lagoon with all the fish. Since we had a 6 month old with us, a snorkeling strip or diving excursion was out of the question and the lagoon fulfilled that need to see fish. I find the big island a little boring (besides kona brewing of course), but in the event we came back I would stay here hands down.

Then, in 1997, we visited what was then the new Four Seasons on the Big Island at Hualala'i. We fell in love. The property is spread out. There can be hundreds of people there and you never feel it. There are four pools, one especially for children (there's a separate toddlers pool nearby). If you want serious swimming, there's yet another pool near the spa. There are two official restaurants, one Italian, the other Pacific Rim fusion. You can arrange special private dinners on the beach with Hawaiian music and real hula. The concierge staff is more than helpful. They can arrange almost anything. The spa is great. I enjoy massage and facials, which they do well. The rooms are comfortable, and provide DVD players, which we use for our own collection that we bring along. We brought our whole staff once and it was a great success, lots of places for dining and even a real luau with the pug buried in the dirt overnight. It's all here and nothing is a problem. For exercise there is a great gym. For us, it's the five-mile walk around the property winding up on the beach at sunset. Of course, there's plenty of space for sunning, though swimming is pretty much restricted to the pools. We come every year to rest, relax, read, regroup.

They even let us (three year old and I) get clubs and a cart to play three holes for free. The pools are perfect and each of the three has it's on vibe with scenic views of the ocean and mountains. The snorkling pond was terrific but very cold. The actual beach for swimming was just OK, much better beaches only five minutes away. Used the spa and gym everyday, top notch and the services are good. We loved the restaurants and had the breakfast buffett every morning.while looking over the ocean. Rooms were large and bathrooms spa-like, we even got a outdoor shower. Our building location was next to the adults only pool so we had a nice walk to the kids pools which was OK. If I had to do over again I would ask for building 5. Service is at the pinnacle. Lost my cell phone day one in a cab and they were able to track it down in two hours. The few knocks. Room service food was good not great. Room maids would not come until after 3pm, though we never asked for earlier as I'm sure they would have accommodated. The could have kept up the trash a bit better around the pools. Not that there is trash everywhere but you would think if a empty water bottle or cup was laying around for two minutes they would trash it. Location is a catch 22. Very remote and surreal setting that is totally relaxing. But trying to get to the next area with action can take an hour or so with traffic.

449386433,50,"Perfect, Actually.","I have been lucky to stay at a few outstanding five-star properties in my travels, some of them in Hawaii, and after weighing carefully, I think the Four Seasons Hualalai has been by far the most exceptional in my experience in terms of amenities, service, food and ambiance.    I was here for a week on the resort, in one of the homes just north of the central hotel. Proximity was good but we took advantage of the golf carts provided by the homeowner to make our way down to the central area. The home I stayed in was privately-owned with full access to the hotel and it's amenities (pools, classes, fitness centre, spa, restaurants etc.). For this reason I cannot comment specifically on the hotel's rooms, which other reviewers seem very pleased with.    I think what I liked most about the Four Seasons Hulalalai was it's understated elegance and how seamlessly it blended in with it's natural surroundings (i.e. no hi-rise buildings, making use of colours and materials native to the Hawaiian islands, etc). To wit: when we first arrived, it wasn't immediately obvious where the lobby was (psst: this is a compliment). And yet there was no question about it's luxuriousness - this is a place for pampering, for unfettered relaxation, and a place of subtle indulgences, all served up beautifully - and most importantly in my opinion - without pretension.    I made excellent use of the Fitness Centre, which was spotless and equipped with state-of-the-art machines. There was also chilled bottled waters, sports drinks and fruit. I attended Aquafit (held in the pristine lap pool) and used the tennis courts (morning tennis clinic was a pleasure). The daily array of classes offered made this a kind-of fitness heaven - yoga, pilates, aerobics, barre etc. I like to be active on vacation and these outstanding facilities made the fitness centre a daily draw for me, and a compelling reason to come back one day.    The other pools - of which there are many - are stunning. I spent most of my time at the relaxation pool which offered up the usual high-end attentive service with food and drinks, and FS signature pleasures like complimentary sunglasses cleaning, mini-smoothies, fruit popsicles, and a never-empty glass of ice water. One thing I really appreciated was that you didn't have to rent the canopy beds. The loungers at all the pools were first-come, first-serve.    I didn't book a service at the spa, but all of the spa amenities (including day use of the locker rooms) are available to guests regardless. I particularly enjoyed the eucalyptus steam room (dreamy and decadent!) and the cold plunge pool (hey-oo!).  The shampoo and conditioner in the ladies showers smelled great, too! Nice touches abound - fresh unused hairbrushes if you decide to dry your hair, razors, shower caps, etc. Really delightful.    The beachfront of the property is stunning and vast, with an extensive network of running/walking trails. Sea turtles regularly sunbathe on the beach. There is good snorkelling. Everything is pristine, pristine, pristine.    We ate at 'ULU Ocean Grill, the Beech Tree, the Hualalai Grille and the Residents' Beach House. Each was excellent with really top-notch service and cuisine. My favourite was Beech Tree - excellent Italian and fresh fish, prepared creatively. I highly recommend the bruschetta made with Maui WOW tomatoes. Mmmmmm!    Shopping is limited, but gaaaahhhhhh (that's the sound of my jaw dropping on the floor). If you have a few extra thousand dollars burning a hole in your Pucci bikini wrap, this would be an excellent place to pick up those jeweled Dolce & Gabanna sandals you've had your eye on. The Seaside Luxe boutique has a meticulously curated selection of designer beachwear and tropical-inspired accessories with a jewelery collection to die for. The staff are very friendly, and didn't bat an eyelash when I picked up several sparkly things that were casually (but beautifully) merchandised on the tables. You know, things with prices similar to those of small cars.    For the rest of us mere mortals, the Seaside Beach boutique has an equally well-curated selection of beach, casual and athletic wear for men and women that errs on the side of affordable-ish-chic.    What more can I say about this place? It seems as though management has thought through every single detail in creating an outstanding, luxurious guest experience without ever being in-your-face. Complimentary stocked laundry rooms? Check. Clean flip flops to borrow if you forgot yours in the room? Check. Sunscreen and aloe by the pool? Of course!    FS Hualalai is not a resort that screams ""Here I am! Here I am!"" but rather a resort that subtly beckons only after you're gone, asking why you had to leave. It is a slice of paradise on earth, situated in *actual* paradise on earth (Hawaii). I hope to be lucky enough to return one day.",Jan 2017,December 2016,Traveled with family,,"Toronto, Canada"

Service matches too. If you are used to more expansive resorts, like the Hilton up the road, this is a different gem- the pool seems small, the dining seems small, the grounds a bit cloistered, but thats the thing, the property to ratio is very small. It's great. They typical high end accouterments abound for a FS property, the food is wonderful (actually preferred the Beach Tree Bar food though, try the BC burger) with a brew. Golf is plentiful on and off property, shopping is a 10min drive N or S. The beach is small, but there is room on the north side that is best for lounging on the beach, though you are so close to the water at the terrace area, if you want to stay sand-free, that's a safe bet.

448352180,50,Outstanding in every way...great honeymoon,"This property and its staff are phenomenal. We spent a week here for our honeymoon in September. From the moment we arrived and were greeted with cool towels and drinks to the (sad) moment we had to leave, every single experience was great. At check-in, our bags (and us) were loaded onto a golf cart and escorted to our room. The young man then asked if we wanted a tour of the property. He whisked us around for about 30 minutes showing us where everything was located and giving us the lowdown on the restaurants.    There is a reason the Four Seasons is known for excellence. We had a room that overlooked the main pool (ground floor), so we could walk from our patio area to the pool if we wanted to. The patio turned out to be an excellent place to eat our lunch most days. Rooms are spacious and very comfortable. We chose a room with an outdoor shower, and it was well worth the splurge. After using it the first night, I didn't use the indoor shower at all the entire week! There are other pools available, and be sure to check out the King's Pond for the ray feeding. There is also a mile long walking path along the ocean. It was great for walking for exercise in the mornings, and a leisurely stroll after dinner. Keep an eye out during the day for the sea turtles. We were told they are a sign of good luck, and we saw eight during the week!    Everyone on the staff was wonderful. There was a young man (originally from Chicago) who assisted us poolside. He was a pleasure and stopped to talk to us every day. We appreciated his restaurant and activity advice. Unfortunately, I misplaced my paper where I wrote down his name, but I hope the hotel manager can identify him from his information and pass along how much we enjoyed interacting with him. They provide as many towels as you want, sunscreen, and ice water. You can also order from the menu to have lunch and/or snacks poolside.    A special shout out to Judy and Alicia in the Trading Post store. We spoke with them the day we were leaving about a place to grab lunch prior to heading to the airport. Wish we had run into them sooner because they were both a wealth of information. The Trading Post is within walking distance of the rooms and has a nice selection of gift items and food. They also have a coffee bar and some bakery items. Everything we tried was good.    We also went to the spa and had a great experience. I highly recommend the coconut scrub with the Vichy shower.    Finally, we tried all the restaurants at the hotel. Our favorites were the little beach bar down past both pools and the Hualalai Grille. The bar was great for a lunch and to get out of the sun for awhile. The steakhouse was our favorite meal of the week, and the staff there was awesome!    Overall, this is a wonderful hotel with an excellent staff. It is not necessarily near things (Kona is about a 20-30 minute drive away), so if you are doing other sightseeing, plan accordingly. We rented a car and spent out day traversing the island. It just depends on what you want to see.

447579411,20,Resting on its laurels,"This used to be one of the great Hawaiian resorts. Alas, it isn't one any longer. The service is still top notch and up to the high Four Seasons standards, but the physical plan has been badly underinvested in the last 10 years, prices have gone stratospheric and the unique situation with the condos and houses nearby makes it a very challenging place to stay as a hotel guest.    The rooms badly need a renovation. We rented three rooms, including a suite, over Christmas and all of them were musty, smelled, and beaten up. Frankly, below Four Seasons standards anywhere in the world.    The food is mediocre, slow, and overpriced. We waited over 1.5 hours multiple times to get our lunch and dinner at Beach Tree, the main family restaurant. Quality was relatively low. My pasta tasted like it was made by Olive Garden. Ulu, is better, but nowhere as good as 10 years ago when it was Pahuia. But prices are much higher. Most fish entrees are $50 or so. Plus you have to pay for sides. Would be fine if quality were top notch -- it isn't.    But the worst part is that the resort has to share its beach and pools with the adjacent real estate development. Which means that during any busy season you can't get beach or pool chairs, restaurant reservations, or tennis appointments. Who wants to pay $2k/night for a room and $3k for a suite and be begging the beach staff to ""please find me somewhere to sit on the beach"". Or book dinner reservations six weeks in advance to get a 6pm slot?    I realize that the developer makes more money by selling homes and lots and has been doing that for 15 years but they haven't added any capacity on the beach, Pools, or restaurants. Why should hotel guests suffer?    This hotel has sunk dramatically from where it used to be. There are much better luxury options in Hawaii, including the recently reopened Four Seasons properties on Lanai and Oahu.

441946749,30,Aug 2016 wedding,"I have waited a few months and collected opinions from family and friends before I wrote this review. I most likely will not be planning a Hawaiian wedding ever again, so hopefully this review helps someone else in their decision making.  First off- the grounds are breathtakingly gorgeous! 5 star. The food- every bite was delicious! Again, 5 star. The flowers- done by the in house designer and if I could give more than 5 stars, I would. Absolutely the most beautiful arrangements and leis ever! And now, for the issues we had, which we were certainly not expecting for a hotel of this caliber.  Planning- we decided to go with an outside wedding planner, as my daughter wanted to add her own personal touches to her tables, decorations, etc. I'm not sure if this is where all our issues stemmed from or not.  We did not have access to the menus for months to make food choices. We booked a year in advance, but when we still didn't have the 2016 menus months into 2016, it was a problem. We were encouraged to just put ""fish"", ""chicken"", etc on our reception reply cards, which we did not want to do. Only after calling the 4 Seasons directly did we get the menus via our wedding planner.  Our wedding was held at the Palm Grove in deference to the groom not wanting a wedding on the beach. While the setting is beautiful, be aware that there is a pool directly behind the space (we were told they move the pool guests to the ""back"" area of the pool (my description, not theirs), and there is a walkway directly in front of the space. There will be people basically wandering through your wedding for the whole ceremony. They will be in your pictures and video. We were told they only have one wedding per day at the 4 Seasons, so why not just put up a tasteful sign to divert traffic for the 15-20"" it takes to have the actual ceremony? People stopped to take pictures, etc. It was very distracting and took away from the personal aspect of the ceremony.  With a 2 night minimum stay at approximately $1000/ night, our bride and groom opted for a stay beginning with their wedding day. That meant that even though they know you need to get into your room for wedding prep, there are no guarantees when you will actually get in there. You are allowed to wait in the golf lounges, but we didn't get into our room by the 2:30pm appt we had for hair and make up, so we were rushed and flustered trying to get everyone ready. Again, it's the only wedding you are having that day. You can't have a room ready by 2:30pm? The room itself was gorgeous and the bride and groom loved their stay at the resort. We did notice in the pictures of flowers that were taken on chairs in the room that the upholstery was stained, so we couldn't choose any of those pictures.  The service time was coordinated to have sunset photos taken, but this also caused a problem in our photos in that the sun bleached out almost all the group photos after the ceremony. I'm not sure if it's a photographer issue, or just what you have to deal with for time of day/ availability of photo location at the Palm grove area.  Our reception was held at the Garden Lawn area, which is a short walk through the resort. It was so windy that we couldn't light any candles, and the frames holding the seating charts tipped over and had to lay flat on the table. The space was secluded and perfect size- wise for our group of approximately 45 guests. I was called to help bustle my daughters dress- so I walked back up the path (it's dark by now), asking for my daughter to help me and was told she was coming. I met the bride and groom at the top of the path and had to bustle her dress by myself by CELL PHONE FLASHLIGHT. I kept asking for my daughter, but instead the planners tried to do it with me ( and got it wrong.) I had to fumble around, and basically finally gave up because it was taking too long. Really? There was no other place to bustle her dress where we could actually see what we were doing? And you couldn't get my daughter to help even after numerous requests? The result was that the back of the dress looks like she has a shelf on her behind for all the first dance type photos. Ugh.  The reception was done at 10pm - this is the 4 Seasons requirement. I would have loved one more hour. We didn't want to party all night, but apparently it's quiet time or something after 10pm. Again, if you want sunset photos, this does cut into the time you have afterwards for a reception.  Our budget for the 4 Seasons wedding/reception was $35,000. Maybe this isn't ""luxe"" enough to guarantee a smooth, hassle free experience. We had expectations of superb, 5 star service and it felt like we were the red headed stepchild coming to the 4 Seasons.  Hope these details help in your planning!",Dec 2016,August 2016,Traveled with family,,minneapolis MN

You feel like you are alone even though most of the time, the rooms are most likely sold out. I would recommend the bottom floor so you can enjoy the outdoor shower. The room also comes with an indoor shower. I have a nut allergy and made them aware of it during my first meal there. They asked me my name and for the rest of the trip, I didn't have to worry about my allergy because they already knew about it.

The grounds are immaculate, the setting other-worldly. This resort is so beautiful that it took my breath away - repeatedly. The sunsets on the beach are truly breathtaking. The rooms are beautifully appointed. I personally could not find fault with any part of the physical buildings. The food and beverages at all of the restaurants is varied, delicious and fresh. The prices are as you might expect at a luxury hotel - very expensive. I had a great experience at the spa as well, with both massage and nails. Above and beyond anything, however, are the staff. To a person, they are warm and generous - NEVER condescending or difficult at all. I was married in a small ceremony on the beach and EVERYONE at the resort bent over backwards to accommodate any request that we had (I think that we were pretty low-key). I got the sense that a significant amount of work and communication goes on between senior staff members to try to ensure that guests are treated extremely well and that needs and wants are anticipated. April Harnett was our wedding manager and she, along with outside vendors and other staff were beyond professional and kind. The resort is small and family-oriented but I would feel very comfortable there with just other adults as there are multiple areas of the resort that seemed to be more adult-friendly.    I have travelled all over the world and been lucky enough to stay at some of the world's best hotels, resorts, safari camps. The warmth of the staff at this hotel, combined with the physical and natural beauty, the spa, sports amenities, and food and beverage options, combines to make this hotel the best I've ever had the privilege of visiting.

It has a human and welcoming scale that puts you in touch with the outdoors immediately and always--no elevators needed, two stories high, mostly, very open public spaces, spacious rooms that feel private and glorious views from the pool and ocean front areas (and some rooms). In a week, we were greeted by every staff member we passed, impressed by the intelligence and helpfulness of every member of that staff, and fell in love with the grounds (which at first take some time to navigate). Most five star properties aren't really five stars, but this one surely is. Amenities are excellent, beds wonderful, baths large and comfortable. The on site restaurants are pricey but excellent, with the sort of general store providing a little relief from the priciness. The golf course is impeccable and impeccably run, if that's your thing.    Now, what not to expect: There are no large beaches along the lines of Kapalua Bay. There are no great places to snorkel that are walkable. The only real ocean swimming that is practical is in a limited area behind a sort of breakwater.

436260113,50,Exquisite resort,We spent 5 nights and 4 days here and were reluctant to leave. The van driver for our helicopter flight said that the resort had powerful aloha and he was right. The staff..everyone..greeted us with aloha or mahalo. Our room overlooking the Kings Pond had direct ocean views and we slept each night with the patio doors open so we could hear the waves. We had the added luxury of an outdoor shower. The three restaurants were top notch as were the five pools. Each morning we walked 3+ miles on an ocean path. The gym and lap pool were the finest we've seen at a resort. It's costly but worth every dollar and earns its five star rating.,Nov 2016,November 2016,Traveled as a couple,,"Columbus, Ohio"
435953286,50,Romantic Hawaiin Retreat,"As avid travelers for both business and pleasure; My fiance and I often choose to stay at Four Seasons' wherever we go due to their consistency in excellent customer service, luxury accommodations and tasty dining options. However, the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai on the quaint island of Kona, was much more swoon-worthy than we could have ever imagined!    Set on The North Kona coast; the entire property is massive, including hundreds of guest suites, private villas, pools, restaurants & bars, tennis center and championship golf course. However, the resort is so well designed and laid out, you will feel as if you are in your own private Hawaiin Oasis. Filled with hundreds of palm trees, hibiscus plants and other native Kona flora, this property is a dream for those who seek an authentic environment. For a truly majestic morning; Pick up a cup of authentic Kona coffee in the lobby then follow the trail bordering the entire property for not only a breathtaking scenic experience but a pretty good cardio session as well!    Our guest room was spacious, clean and designed to honor the best aspects of Kona's landscape. With great ocean views, a private outdoor shower and a heavenly feather bed, the room was a serene experience after sun-filled days.    Although we ate at all of the Resort restaurants at one point or another, my favorite was Beach Tree. Designed with ample outdoor dining space on the coastline, Beach Tree offered fresh and delicious options for every palette. For breakfast, they offer a variety of fresh pressed juices and smoothies to start and don't forget to indulge in the freshly brewed famous Kona coffee! Along with the traditional breakfast options, Beach Tree is also known for their fresh Acai power bowls, crepes, and gluten free options.    The resort is full of day time activities for any mood. Chill out on the multiple hammocks tucked in serene spots around the property, grab a cocktail and go for a dip in the infinity pool, rent a racquet and play a round of tennis, attend a fitness class or book a decadent spa treatment! The only thing I would change about my stay is making it longer :)    I especially want to thank the staff of the Four Seasons Hualalai for the five-star treatment we received as flustered travelers. After our connecting flights between Miami and Kona were cancelled and re-scheduled (multiple times), our luggage had been predictably misplaced. We arrived in Kona in the late evening, after 16 hours of travel with nothing but the clothes on our back and our carry-on luggage. We were told the rest of our luggage would not arrive until later the following day, however we had already scheduled a helicopter tour of the island for the following morning. Upon arriving, we each received a beautiful orchid lei and fresh Mai Tai, which instantly calmed our previous frustrations. How could you still be upset after such a beautiful welcome? Not to mention, upon arriving at the resort, you know you're in paradise. Ten minutes after checking into our room, housekeeping came with two luxurious toiletry kits and took our dirty clothes for overnight laundry service, so we would have clean clothing to wear on our excursion. The following afternoon, the hotel transport delivered the rest of our luggage from the airport before the airline even called to inform us of its arrival! I couldn't believe how much personal care we were given in such a large resort. The concierge was also extremely helpful in providing recommendations for dining, off-property daytime activities and booking transportation.

It is quite spread out, which we loved because we took walks every day to the different swimming pools and walking paths. My favorite part of this resort was the walking path at the beach that went all the way to the golf course. Beautiful. Our room was gorgeous with a huge bathroom and private balcony. We ordered room service for breakfast every morning which was great every time. We enjoyed the ""spa"" pool which was also called the ""quiet"" pool. It had a swim up bar, you could have foot massages, and they really spoiled us. My husband really enjoyed the golf course. I just never felt ""trapped"" because of the size but on the same note, it didn't feel too big. It was very personalized. We have been to Oahu, Lanai and Maui.

435109742,50,Four Season Resort Hualalai Big Island,"We stayed here for 5 nights after our stay at the Four Seasons on Maui. These properties are totally different, but each is spectacular. We absolutely loved the property on the big island. Everything you would expect from the Four Seasons brand, and everything you expect Hawaii to be. The grounds and landscaping are spectacular, the pools beautiful, the rooms and balconies amazing, and the beach and pathways relaxing and serene. The only thing I will say is the limited number of restaurants on property. The property itself is quite isolated so there is really no where to go. One restaurant was under renovation, which really only left two. They were both beautiful however, right on the beach. The property has chairs and seating areas everywhere, so there was never an issue with finding somewhere to sit during the day.The service on the beach and at the pools was great, but our favourite was the spa. We each had 2 massages which were amazing. Outdoor showers, steam room, sauna and whirlpools were heaven. We stayed by King's pond because we wanted to be away from small kids and families. Great location. Loved everything about this property, except the cost!

On arrival at the airport, you are met at the plane and escorted to a waiting cab. You are met at the door and escorted to a corner of the very tasteful lobby and checked in.  Yes, it is expensive.

It is not cheap, but after excellent experiences at other Four Seasons resorts and outstanding reviews for this property, we booked this resort. It was the best decision that we could have made for the trip!!! From the moment we drove down the long driveway up to the resort, it seemed as though we were approaching Paradise. Beautiful palm trees, perfect landscaping, outstanding architecture.    The rooms were beautiful, large, and had an additional private outdoors shower! Every area of the resort, and it is large spread-out resort, appeared picturesque like from the cover of a travel magazine.    The service was what made this resort so amazing. We never passed by an employee without a smile and friendly greeting.    A stay at Four Seasons Hualalai truly made us feel like we were on an island paradise getaway. We have been fortunate enough to stay at some great resorts, including FS Maui, Bora Bora, Paris, Beverly Hills, and Budapest.

433735458,40,"Beautiful, but was Better","This was our second stay at the Four Seasons on the Big Island. We first came 5 years ago. The property is just as gorgeous as ever, and in a beautiful location. However, some of the Aloha has gone, and it may be our last trip. When you pay $1,000 per day, it comes with an expectation of excellence and I think they are struggling with this.    If you arrive before 3pm, you will most likely wait for your room, we expected that. We went to the bar...and when we were called, expected the bellman to find us. He did not, we went back to the front desk and located him, sans luggage. Ok, it must be in the room already...so they said, it was not. Finally it was found...I think my husband tipped three bellman through the ordeal. It turned out fine. Just not on their game.    Pool-always great service and a beautiful setting at the Beach Tree. Gone are the cold towels and offers to clean sunglasses. They do keep the water coming and the service for purchases is very good.    Restaurants-one was closed so we ate at Ulu and Beach Tree. Prices have gone up, if that was even possible. (Yes, I know Hawaii is an expensive place, this was probably our 15th trip...but it's getting obnoxious in some areas at the resort.) Wine and cocktails are 2-4 dollars more each than in the past. Some of the food portions are quite large and can be shared. Food was OK, nothing special. We did really enjoy the sushi at Ulu and the Bolagnase pasta at Beach tree. I think the breakfast buffet is a complete rip off at $41, unless you eat a lot. The pancakes and waffles there are not even made to order.    Room-clean and well serviced. They seem to push the filtered water but did leave bottles most days, 2 small ones each time. You can purchase Evian at the store.    Spa-prices went up as well. Yoga classes are super easy, crammed into a small yoga room, and they cost more than last time. I went to only one because it was not challenging...more exercise in a walk. The spa area amenities are very nice. Massage...again, expensive but a good experience.    Kids-apologies to those of you that chose to bring small and crying babies to dinner. It's hard for us couples that came here to leave the city and enjoy peace and quiet, only to find noisy children. Luckily there is a kids pool, but maybe there should be a kids food option too. We specifically choose late October to avoid this, but it no longer works. Not only are there babies, but somehow school age kids too.    Groups-the hotel has obviously made a strategic decision to cater to large groups. This leads to activities for that group only, that you see but are excluded from. It's fine, but it changes the dynamic of the culture here. Last stay 5 years ago over the same time period, did not see any large groups.    Residents- they seem to know all the staff and you watch the staff being very friendly and attentive to them at the bars and restaurants. You feel left out of that a bit, even though you understand it. Last time there was much more shared conversation, just missing this time around.    My biggest negative, there used to be a bar above Ulu for drinks, appetizers, and a wonderful view of the sunset. You guessed it, open for groups only! We had such fond memories and sadly...it's gone. Between the two small bars, not enough sunset seating unless you come early, and that's during a slow time of year!

We had a room overlooking the King's Pond with an ocean view and the sound of the ocean serenading us at night. Snorkeling in the The King's Pond became a daily ritual with its 93 varieties of fish, some almost as big as me! The relaxed, yet attentive service by everyone from the housecleaning people to the people around the pools to the restaurant staff is very special here. Everyone seems happy and it is contagious.

We didn't have enough time to check everything out. Remember to always check the reception area for fresh coffee & tea. Housekeeping was excellent.

430606528,50,Wished I could have stayed for a month,"There were some unexpected features to the resort that went above and beyond for me.    Somehow during the long flight and an unexpected layover, I injured my foot. I called the front desk to see if I could request a cart to drive me around and was offered two paramedics who were also security guards to take a look at it. They showed up in less than 10 minutes, helped me out and brought ice and medical supplies.    I was given a room near the Beachtree restaurant and the quiet pool. As I was sitting on the lanai the first night, there was a local Hawaiian musician playing for the restaurant. It was beautiful and relaxing. I felt like I was at a private concert. Almost each night different musicians played, some with hula dancers. What a treat at the end of the day.    I loved the cabanas at the beach and found the sea turtles resting there to be adorable. The cocktails you can order are really great, with herbs from the spice garden near the bar.    I had a dinner business meeting to attend at the Hualalai Grille, which is basically a steakhouse. As a vegetarian this can be very uncomfortable. I called the concierge and was assured the Grille had a separate vegetarian menu. The menu was printed and waiting for me in the room before noon.

428992057,50,Really tough to beat,"My husband and I stayed here for our anniversary and my birthday in September. While the check-in took longer than I would have anticipated (or liked), when I got to my room, I understood why. The hotel had set up a beautiful spread with champagne, snacks and a gorgeous arrangement of flowers my husband apparently ordered before we arrived. My bad!  Our room was very nice, I think we had a prime ocean front. We loved being on the second floor overlooking the pool, straight to the ocean. Room was big enough, had Bose radio which we appreciated. One surprising thing was how ""green"" the resort was. I didn't know there was drinking water in the carafe next to the bed until the next morning. There aren't little shampoo or moisturizer, they have big ones that they refill. Smart.  The food at ULU was outstanding. We had the poke three nights in a row, it was that good. We didn't try the other restaurants. Mai tais were ridiculously delicious. We found the wines very nice and the pours generous. The manager there was terrific. I'm embarrassed I can't remember his name because he remembered ours. I think maybe John?  We had the opportunity to snorkel, using a boat arranged through the hotel. We were lucky in that no one else wanted to go so we were able to go where we wanted to. The guide was fantastic and very accommodating. (The hotel said they needed four people in order to go so we ""bought"" four seats. Much less money than doing a private charter.)  We also did ""The Taste of Golf"" and it was very fun. We had a blast and being greeted with cold towels after we got off the course was refreshing.  We had breakfast in our room twice and it was a treat, food arrived hot and delicious.  We've been lucky enough to stay at some beautiful resorts and I was skeptical about how nice this would be. We were not disappointed. We hope to go back the next time we go to the big Island. (But never at Christmas. I hear it is AWFUL then. Way too many entitled people. Even when we went and it wasn't crowded people still ""saved"" chairs. Silly.)  Tips I would offer:  We stayed at the Mauna Kea for a few nights before we went to the Four Seasons because we wanted to stay at a ""nice beach"". We had heard FS didn't have a beach. We found this not to be true. There is a beach at FS and swimming is decent. I liked staying at one and then the other but please know there is sand at the FS.  Also if you walk along the sidewalk either way, there are great spaces. Past ULU, there is a deserted beach which we had all to our selves for two afternoons. The snorkeling here was like being in an aquarium. Amazing. Walking back to FS one day we passed six turtles on the beach sleeping. I don't think FS likes this promoted though because it is an abandoned resort.  Walk the other way and see the beautiful golf course and gorgeous homes and come to the FS Residence beach. This was empty except for two or three other groups there. There is a raft you can swim out to which we did. (This is where we picked up the snorkeling boat.)  We also did the helicopter thing but arranged that through the Mauna Kea. Apparently both hotels use Sunshine or Blue Hawaiian. We went Sunshine and loved it because you could pay a little extra to assure the front seats.  Didn't swim in the King's pool.  One thing needed clarification. There was a burlap bag in our dressing room when we arrived. We used it every time we went to the beach and loved it. Put wet towels/snorkel gear/lotion in it. When we left resort, got a ""late charge"" of $60 for bag. Seriously? When I called about it, it was taken off and I was grateful for it but I felt bad. Who would use it after we got it dirty? And to charge $60 without telling us it would be $60? For a burlap bag? Not enough to make me not go back but was surprised and hope FS change this policy.",Oct 2016,September 2016,Traveled as a couple,We liked the second floor rooms.,"Boston, Massachusetts"

The downstairs rooms have gorgeous outdoor Lava wall showers with ferns and flowers. You find yourself coming up with reasons to have three or four showers a day just to experience this paradise.    The hotel is situated into four unique coves of rooms. My favorite happens to be the fishpond cove. It is one of the quietest coves and also the most dramatic.    The staff is spectacular and the food is mouthwatering if not extremely expensive.    Of course there is also a beautiful exercise facility and spa.

Every single employee here says ALOHA when they pass by you whether driving or walking they truly go out of their way to ensure you feel the spirit, way to go.  We have stayed here 10 nights and they all have been wonderful, our room was near kings pond and this is a must visit whether your on a couples retreat or with kids, in fact it's a great place to lounge for the day ( very peaceful ). All four restaurants on the property were great and the trading post is a great place to enjoy a very basic breakfast With great morning pastries and your not stuck paying that HIGH cost buffet breakfast we all don't care for..  The room was great, deluxe ocean view it's a one bedroom with awesome private lava shower outside and a large glass shower inside, great lanai (porch) and there was a tub but not used, the closet was a perfect size. You have a mini refer in the room big enough for drinks and snacks. Wifi is also free.    The grounds at this resort were top notch and were so beautiful, worth the walk around many times, another place to check out that many may not see, make sure you walk in the tranquil stream in the spa area ( gosh how beautiful). Close by there is a wonderful gym with everything you could imagine, you won't miss a beat here and everything was so clean.  Last thing if your here for a special occasion as we were for two, they do some real special things for you I won't tell you what but just know they go above and beyond to make you feel the ALOHA spirit.

423340964,50,Best place we've ever stayed in Hawaii...,"We stayed at the Four Seasons Hualalai for our 20th anniversary in September, in the Anelakai suite (room 102). The room was wonderful and right on the ocean so that you can hear the roar of the ocean at night, which made me sleep like a baby. The suite has a beautiful outdoor shower that is attached to the master bathroom, and a small soaking pool on the lanai. I would give the room a 9/10: the only downside to the Anelakai suite is that it is not as private as they would have you believe in the online brochure. You have neighbors above you and on both sides. Sometimes the neighbors were loud, but not often. The pool on the lanai is private, but the grassy area is shared, which means neighbors walking by, etc. This wasn’t too bad, but the Four Seasons website states “private lawn”, which is simply not true.  The grounds of the hotel are wonderful. It is a peaceful place, and not crowded. It is easy to get a great table at the restaurants or bars, and there is no fighting to get a chair near the pool, unlike some of the luxury hotels in Maui and other places. The FS Hualalai has those other places beat by a mile.  Finally, I should mention that one of the best parts of our experience was our “Suite Experience Manager”, Stephanie. She was our single point of contact for everything, and she truly went above and beyond to make our anniversary special, from beginning to end. I’m not sure how I ever vacationed without a Suite Experience Manager!!

420719259,50,The Only Resort To Stay on in Hawaii,"We spent 10 glorious nights here. When I return next year I won't make that mistake  Again. It will be 14 fantastic nights. I have been to The Four Seasons on Maui on four  Different occasions. Please tell them I won't be returning. Everything you could possibly want in a Hawaiin vacation is at The Four Season Rsort Hualalai. You can swim with the fishes in their pool. I swam with a turtle at their beach. No I didn't touch it and I did my best to keep a 20 foot distance between us but he/she came up to join me in a morning swim. As for the food well you can eat steak or have Real Italian food or sit at their Sushi Bar. Did I mention the breakfast buffet with fresh fruit and the great omlets that Daniel made for us? What a view from our table. If we were any closer to the ocean we would need a towel. I also had a freshly made smoothly in the early afternoon. As for alcohol you name it and you could have any exotic drink or a glass of fine wine. The poolside and beach service was outstanding. When I got out of the ocean from my swim a pool attendant greeted me with a fresh towel. I went to their cultural center and Hilani taught me how to play the Ukulele. She also generously gave me her own book to take home with me so I can practice. As for the room it was a magnificent ocean front view. We even had a private second outdoor shower. Housekeeping service was twice a day and the room was always freshly made up. We ordered room service to come at 5:45 am and guess what? Precisely at 5:45 am our omlets and hot coffee and rolls and freshly squeezed juice arrived. Car valets always promptly had our car up and gave us cold water and directions. Thanks Katlin at concierge for your fine help with our tours. Thanks Four Seasons for supporting the fight against Cancer by supporting a taste of Hawaii and the Terry Fox run.

419898027,50,Lovely but needs a few things...,"Lovely hotel compound for luxury-seeking travelers. We had young children in our three groups and we all enjoyed our stay immensely. So did our friends who traveled without children. It really is a fantastic place to relax and unwind whether alone, as a couple, or with a children and family. The service is great. No elevators, shuttles or Escher-like hotel complex here; this hotel is a very-walkable Polynesian inspired compound with meandering paths, lush tropical gardens, bungalow-style guest rooms and suites, long stretches of beachfront, and a fantastic spa and exercise facility. You can read all the positive reviews on this site to get to the heart of its charms so I will cut right to my gripes: The hotel’s lack of organic food options for travelers who prioritize health and high quality food is disappointing especially on an island so known for its healthy offerings for body and mind. An organic pineapple for my piña colada(s)? Nope. I was told they were made with a mix. Not even fresh fruit. That should change. The only organic food option for children is the milk. While that is a teensy bit of progress, organic food offerings should be a mainstay of all luxury hotel/spa menus everywhere. Especially for growing children. Another galling food-related practice here is the up-charging of fresh-squeezed juice. I was actually asked more than once in different restaurants on premises when I ordered fruit juice if I wanted it fresh-squeezed. The answer to that is usually an emphatic yes (right?) but then when I discovered patrons are charged more for the fresh-squeezed juice than the, what – unfresh juice? – I felt that bad feeling you get when you realize you’re being nickeled and dimed. Those feelings often have the tendency to diminish all the beauty and fabulousness this resort offers. And there are those sorts of reminders that you're not in the fantasy you've trade your reality for. Please, Hotel Gods, build these kinds of costs into the room or service charge or some other “resort fee” gouging we are all humiliated by anyway. These rates are not for the faint of heart so guests here should always be offered the very best. Go beyond conventional and typical food service standards. And why a steak house on site? It’s not particularly special or appetizing. Service inconsistent, too. And again, I prefer no growth hormones, antibiotics and genetically modified organisms in my steaks and well, everything I eat! (Maybe instead of a steakhouse, what about a luxurious hibachi style place or something consistent with the Polynesian or pan-Pacific theme)? Moving on from the food… kid’s club services. Most of the kid’s club programming is really great: rock-climbing, tennis, group sports (opt to play or not) fun games and crafts, contact with marine life, swimming and boating. But there is no excuse for putting children in front of screens as an activity. I am careful to monitor my children’s screen consumption and I was unhappy with the hotel kid’s club practice of showing the children animated movies and offering video games. This is the opposite of “activity” and it should be discontinued by kid’s club programmers. Immediately. There are so many wonderful opportunities for adventures and fun in this gorgeous slice of heaven and child guests should be offered the very best just like their parents (in theory). Kids Club instructors should also be versed (at least glancingly) in some form of childhood development. They should also possess knowledge about social emotional learning, conflict resolution, and appropriate modes of speaking to children. This would be a wonderful change to an otherwise good Kid’s Club program. And another request on this topic: natural materials for children’s crafts. No more plastic beads, please! Beyond those issues I was very happy and will be coming again for a third time next year. We stayed in ocean view rooms and suites and recommend those splurges… although I did sleep well in a golf course-view room when my suite wasn’t ready and getting a full, quiet night’s sleep is paradise to me so… you will be happy in any room if you just want quiet and rest. The beach has swimming which is such a nice respite from the pool culture there. (Pool areas need some TLC but are overall pretty good although service is quite spotty. Same for the beach. More attendants, please). Finally, check-in staff tipped me off to competitive rates through my American Express Platinum card. They wouldn’t honor any of those rates since I booked directly with the hotel but then the rates may not always be better and they told me so. I believed them but more diligent planners should check the credit card options and amenities before booking. Ultimately, It was hard to leave the idyllic Hawaiian charms of this place.",Sep 2016,July 2016,Traveled with family,,"Santa Monica, California"

415944090,50,Heaven on Earth!,"Eleven years ago my husband and I came to the Four Seasons Hualalai to celebrate my 40th birthday in style. We discovered heaven on earth. While we were enjoying our romantic getaway away from the kids we noticed many families enjoying themselves. It was then that my husband looked dreamily into my eyes and said ""one day we'll be back with the kids"". Eleven years later with 3 teenagers in tow we returned to the Four Seasons Hualalai and we were not disappointed. The service is the perfect blend of anticipation of your every need and genuine warmth. The staff took care of our special kosher dietary needs with great professionalism and with a smile. The grounds at the Four Seasons Hualalai utilize the local volcanic rock and blend it with the lush flowers that you expect to see in Hawaii. The facilities are top notch throughout from the tennis courts, the spa, the fitness room and the canoe club. The Kings Pond where you can swim, snorkel or snuba with thousands of fish placed there expressly for the guests pleasure and delight is absolutely amazing. The 4 pools offer something for everyone. If you are picky about your beach you should know that the beach is great to look at and find giant sea turtles or have a romantic dinner by the waves but it is rocky and not the best beach on the island. Nevertheless there is so much to do on the property it adds to the feeling of never wanting to leave. We had a ground floor room with an outdoor shower. It seems to be the same decor as our last visit 11 years ago but that is not a bad thing since it was fine then and was fine now. We love the outdoor shower that adds to the feeling of enjoying nature. This time around I discovered that there were stocked laundry rooms conveniently located near all of the rooms for our washing pleasure. An added bonus when you travel with kids.

The chairs facing the ocean are placed in a single line, nothing to obstruct your view of the sea turtles, dolphins and whales. I also really appreciate that while they are kid friendly, there are separate and designated kiddo areas.

413742916,30,Poor experience,"My husband and I decided to stay at four seasons Hulalai after our wonderful experience at the fs at Maui. We arrived on Monday. First the positives, the grounds were beautiful, immaculate, and kings pond was a very unique feature that we loved . Our problem was with the service specifically the pool side service . For two days, we picked beach lounge chairs but had to wait around and finally flagged down someone to place the covers on. Then our attendant gave us water and menu and did not show up for another couple of hours . She did not check with us to see if we wanted to order drinks or food. I got really hungry and went in search for an attendant and found 4 of them standing at the shack just talking. We didn't experience any of the little treats that other reviews mentioned. I was really disappointed . At the four seasons Maui, the attendants were friendly and took the time to know and call us by our names.    This part of the review is regarding the hotel'S handling of the hurricane Madeline . First as we were seated beach side, someone came with a letter that stated they are closing the four seasons . Then she promptly told us that the front desk has a paper with phone numbers and that it is our responsibility to call and make alternative travel arrangements. On the list of paper were airline numbers and 2 hotels who could accommodate us. We decided to stay at Mauna Kea . The paper stated that the Mauna Kea rooms start at 299, imagine my surprise and sticker shock when we called and were quoted 550. Seriously, four seasons should have confirmed pricing and even negotiate a group price with the other hotels.  They should also have informed us that the airlines would not charge for change of airfare secondary to the reason, we had to learn this from another guest.    Overall our vacation wasn't ruined by this experience but we were not thrilled with it. Especially given four seasons reputation , they need to do better",Sep 2016,August 2016,Traveled as a couple,,

We met with a concierge personally, she gave us 3 options. Leave for home(and be reimbursed without penalty) stay on Kona at a larger concrete hotel or move to another property. We chose to go to Oahu. They made all reservations for us including transportation in Oahu. We did not lift a finger. I understand how upsetting a disrupted trip can be, but it was a possible danger if a hurricane actually occurred. It did not, so we are headed back, again we did not have to do anything ourselves for the return trip. They even scheduled a helicopter ride at the last moment for us. This is our third trip to this location. It is really amazing. The property is gorgeous and so are the rooms. The service has always been wonderful.

412943883,10,Ruined our vacation,"We were scheduled to stay at the Four Seasons at the end of our 2 week stay in Hawaii based on recommendations by numerous people. We were in Maui and with the approaching hurricane our travel agent received word from the hotel on the Big Island (before we left for the airport) that we could get a full refund if we wanted to cancel due to the storm. We suggested staying at the Four Seasons Maui, but after further discussion Four Seasons encouraged us to make the trip to the Big Island, said we should come to the hotel and that it would be open. After flying to Kona and arriving at the hotel we were informed that they were closing the following day (with a nice smile). The hotel employee, while greeting us with a lovely drink told us we should call our travel agent as the hotel could not help us rebook another hotel (which was false, by the way). FS said the hotel would close at 3pm the next day, but we could stay the night. We decided to stay one night, but AFTER waiting around for our room for quite some time they informed us that all operations would shut down the entire next day. That said they were more than happy to take our $2000 for the night. We scrambled and found an alternative hotel to ride out the hurricane until we leave, which is virtually empty since everyone else left. Obviously they were not advised by Four Seasons staff.    We are beyond disgusted with Four Seasons. They claim it was a ""last minute decision"" and that they ""can't control the weather"" (thanks FS, really helpful...). However this was obviously a distinct possibility given that they offered us a refund due to the approaching storm, before they told us everything was just fine and come on over.    We have stayed at dozens of wonderful, 5 star hotels around the world, and normally Four Seasons is a predictable, very high quality choice. And the property looked beautiful. However given this experience we may never stay at another Four Seasons property. Big mistake and very poorly handled.    So now we'll sit back and enjoy the hurricane for our last 3 days (oh wait, 2 days. Spent one of them traveling to the Four Seasons).

412930034,10,Disaster,We arrived at the Four Seasons today after first calling before we left Maui because there is a storm coming. We were assured that there were sunny skies and all was well. When we arrived we were told the resort was CLOSING the next day and we would have to leave. No offer to help us figure out where to go. Just told to call our travel agent and it wasn't their fault. Of course the storm is no one's fault but not being honest about the possibility of a closure when called only three hours prior to arrival - that is disgusting. And we waited for a room to be ready for the night and then were told there were zero facilities open the next day. We wouldn't have waited!

412654974,20,Heart attack - collapsed baby crib but otherwise great view,I am staying here until this Thurs. It is 2 am and I was very shocked to find out the baby crib that my 19 months son slept on actually collapsed in the middle of the night and my son could have serious injury (but he is sleeping so I will check in the morning). And the staff who came to replace told us the baby crib was set up wrongly (!!) and the metal anchors on side were missing.    I am very concerned about the safety of the basic facilities that a 5-star resort is normally more than capable of offering (well a safe bed for your family is the basic of any hotel).    This is very serious matter and I hope the hotel management immediately check with all the baby cribs in use or idle to avoid potential another heart attack of parents in the middle of the night.,Aug 2016,August 2016,Traveled with family,,

Our wedding coordinator did a fantastic job of making sure everything went to plan. Our wedding cake was absolute perfection, and the chefs made sure it fit my vision to a tee. The food there is to die for; both our wedding reception dinner and our post-wedding meal at the Beach Tree was amazing.    The service at Hualalai is what truly sets it apart from the rest of the luxury hotels. The staff are more than accommodating; friendly and kind. They made sure our stay was comfortable, they upgraded our room so that it was close to our ceremony site, facing the ocean. The golf carts are available to take you around from place to place so that you don't have to walk in the sun/in your high heels. At the reception dinner, one of the servers noticed I (the bride) was too busy chatting with the guests to get my dinner, so he was kind enough to bring a plate to my table directly :) I really appreciated this gesture! The in-house florist, Flowers by Heidi, did all the flowers for the wedding and I was beyond impressed with her artistic vision; it was exactly what I had envisioned!    There are turtles that nest on the beach! Seeing the turtles was definitely one of the highlights of my stay here. Make sure you also snorkel in the king's pond and look for the Eagle Ray. There is also an adults-only pool with a swim up bar that is perfect for couples.    Excellent does not even begin to describe this resort; we felt like we were taken care of from the moment we stepped onto the property. The staff go above and beyond to ensure your needs are met and treat you like royalty. Staying here is expensive but its definitely worth it!

The resort is stunning, spread out over more than 30 acres of landscaped gardens, golf, and amazing ocean views.    For me, the pools are the highlight of this resort: family fun pool, quiet family pool, adult only pool, 25m lap pool (yay!!), and a saltwater fish pool. All this plus the beach. With turtles. Seriously. And a marine biologist on staff for the fish pool.    No issues finding a lounge chair here because the staff is there to help you get settled with towels, ice water and whatever you would like to order brought to you.    Want to snorkel? They bring it to you with free gear at Kings pond with literally thousands of fish. Our kids were thrilled and I appreciated being able to watch them from a shaded lounge chair while they swam.    Accommodation is excellent if a tad compact. Twice daily housekeeping keeps it manageable however. We enjoyed the outdoor lava shower and back door terrace opening to the lawn where the kids could play.    The kids were welcomed with stuffed toy lizards and bubbles that they played with on the lawn outside our door. They loved the kids clubs. I loved that they loved the kids clubs.    Easiest, most time efficient checkout process that I have ever seen. There's an app ;-).    I will say that it's expensive, esp. the food, but I found that most of our meals in Hawaii were more expensive than other vacation destinations.

Even pulled over without us asking to point out a lava cave that was drawing a crowd. Took pictures of my husband and I. Top Notch. I mention this because from the time I landed, the Four Season gives you top attention from soup to nuts.    Get to Four Seasons somehow greeted at security gate with our names. Cab driver confirms he has us in his car. Brings us to front of hotel. As soon as we get out, we are greeted by a number of people bearing leis. No waiting on a long line here.

Golf cart to take you to your room is already waiting outside. Get more of a tour of grounds via golf cart. Love it! The room was amazinggggggggggggggggggggg! It had an outdoor lava rock shower. Amazing view and get this the room was enormous. I loved the walk in closet the bathroom. I loved everything.    I booked using WhatAHotel and got the breakfast amenity.

408793529,40,Wonderful Family Vacation,"We just returned from our 10 days stay with our family (2 adults and our kids aged 12, 16 and 18). I would not hesitate to recommend this resort to anyone.  We had 2 rooms and, although we couldn't get connecting rooms, they were close by and since our kids are older it was fine. Their room was huge and spacious even with the roll away bed added. The housekeeping staff did a great job with twice-daily service - unfortunately, they came at different times every day - sometimes knocking on our door at 8:30am, sometimes not until 3:30 in the afternoon. We did call several times to ask the rooms to be done before noon (and then, unfortunately, they only did one of our rooms). Not a big deal, but it's just something we didn't expect and good to keep in mind if you stay here.  The staff at the pools and beach were wonderful and extremely attentive. We were never without cold water and towels. We especially liked Haley (she always showed up with frozen pineapples or ice pops at the right time) and Jeremy. And even though the hotel was apparently close to capacity, you would never have known it. There was never any problem at all getting chairs where you wanted them. For us, not feeling crowded made the experience so much nicer for us. Sometimes we were even the only people at Kings Pond pool.  The outdoor concierge (and I'm sorry I don't remember her name) was incredible. Aside from recommending a great dolphin/snorkeling boat trip, she recommended our hike to see the lava at the volcano (10 mile trek but well worth it) and some restaurants to try when we were out.  We did eat at every restaurant on the property. The food was good but, aside from the breakfast buffet, nothing memorable. We did have an issue with our service at Ulu (it took us over an hour to get our food as our orders had gotten ""buried""). That was a surprise since the waiter was very attentive and the restaurant didn't seem overly busy. Again, not a big complaint but not something you'd expect at this resort.  We were so glad we rented a car. Our best meals on the island were not at the hotel restaurants. And our trips to the town park, Kona, Hilo, and the volcano were great.

We stayed for a week and the restaurants did get a little boring after a while, but the quality is great. Kona is a 15 minute car ride if you want some restaurant variety or pick up supplies from the Safeway.

For starters, we couldn’t have been more pleased with the room and the quiet room location. For food, Four Seasons is simply the best. We ate at the Hualalai Grill and it was fantastic. I believe the hotel took over the operation since our last visit. Our favorite restaurant was Ulu. Everything was delicious. The wine tasting is a very nice touch. Breakfast here is something to look forward to when going to sleep the night before! Beach Tree is nice too, but it definitely attracts a lot of families with the entertainment out on the grass. I love the coffee and pastries in the morning in the lobby. The gym is well equipped and clean. I loved using the stair stepper outside during the sunrise. The new soda fountain is really cute and the ice cream is delicious. Lounge chairs were a bit tough to find at the adult pool on two days. Pool service was excellent.

Everyone was so nice, all the food was delicious, and I could not get over how well-maintained the hotel was. We loved grabbing breakfast at the little grocery store. We wanted to go back to the spa every day! The quiet pool was absolute heaven. It was overall the best hotel I've ever stayed at.  We did have one small hiccup in that there was a ""Young Living"" oil convention on the last few days. We were super disappointed, as we had expected an intimate experience throughout our stay. The day the convention started, restaurants were closed for the group, the pools became loud, and the wait to get lunch one day was long. Things that I normally wouldn't complain about, but paying the prices we paid, we expected to not have to deal with the large crowds and masses of people. It cheapened our experience a little bit.

The attendants were well aware of the issue, but with only 24 loungers at the Quiet Pool, and 60-70 people IN the pool, they could do nothing but refer to these guests as ""animals"" and apologize to other guests.    We complained to our concierge and they bought us 1 dinner - which hardly makes up for even 1/2 of a day of the cost of the suite per night. Not being able to enjoy the Quiet Pool for the last 3 days of our stay was disappointing, and it was surprising that the Big Island Four Seasons felt in an instant like an all inclusive Mexico party destination or a Vegas Strip joint.    The resort is beautiful, the restaurants were great. The staff was superb. The management is the issue. I would never recommend anyone stay at this property until they fix this major major issue.

Unfortunately, it seemed that my notions of pleasant conversations with a member of the golf staff where very much disingenuous. I am uncertain of what caused the ""golf pro"" to have such a negative view of me and to say such rude things about me. I say ""golf pro"" because not only did he act unprofessional, but is not a member of the PGA. This ""pro"" did not know I was within ear range when he started saying some of the most disrespectful things about myself to another employee. I was so embarrassed I completely avoided the golf area for the remainder of my trip. I was contemplating taking lessons from this ""pro"" because he seemed so nice, friendly and personable. I was even willing to overlook the fact he often had chewing tobacco in his mouth while talking with me. I thought maybe I had been mistaken and looked online if anyone else had had a bad experience with golf or this person, but when I tried to locate his credentials on the PGA website, there were none!

Check in was relaxed and included an introduction to the property and its amenities over Mai Tai's and fresh pineapple. We were brought by golf cart to our suite which was in the quiet Palm Grove area. We were in room 2911, which is a Superior Suite - Prime Ocean View (1 bed/2 bath). Room was in perfect condition and the view was spectacular. Inside there were toys, sweets and a small bathrobe welcoming my daughter (9 years). WiFi is included and connects automatically (no ridiculous logging in or signing up required). There were two full bathrooms stocked with local toiletries (Kāwili Project); the master bathroom included sweeping views of the golf course and Hualālai.    Our package included breakfast at 'ULU, or a daily credit for room service. While our room had a large balcony overlooking the ocean, and included both a lounger and small dining area perfect for in-room dining, we opted for 'ULU every day. Service there was prompt but not rushed - breakfast usually included leisurely reading the paper while my daughter played in the ocean just a few steps away. The food was varied and well prepared, as were the smoothies, coffee, fresh juices, and Bloody Marys. It looks like they sourced locally, whenever possible.    We ate at Beach Tree and 'ULU for dinner on several occasions. Both the food and the service were excellent; both are steps from the beach and provide prime sunset viewing.    There are a lot of activities to do on the property, but we couldn't tear ourselves away from the pools to do them. A real highlight is the King's Pond, containing over 4000 fish, including a spotted eagle ray. You can rent any snorkeling equipment you need (no charge). This was my daughter's favourite pool - she described the underwater experience as ""paradise"". Another highlight for her was the wildlife that called this place home - colorful birds and lizards, and sea turtles relaxing on the beach.    There are about 5-6 other pools as well and you can laze away the entire day pool-hopping. Forgot your sunscreen in the room? No worries, there's both SPF15 and 30 for you at each pool station, as well as leave-in conditioner for your hair.    Housekeeping comes twice daily and they keep the rooms in impeccable shape - shower glass is wiped spotless as are your sunglasses of the seawater and smudges accumulated earlier in the day. They can handle your laundry or you can walk outside and use the the laundry room outside your door (fully stocked with detergent/fabric softener, no charge.)    Occupancy was running at over 80% during our stay, but there was still always a cabana available, with ice water and iced towels provided regularly, along with solid pool service and delicious poolside menu options. There were many guests, but the place didn't feel full. Despite the high occupancy, staff all seem to know your name. Another interesting observation is that the other guests were remarkably polite/helpful too - unknowingly drop the boogie board behind your lounge chair, and another guest walking by would stop to pick it up. Hands full with a fresh omelette and a bowl of pineapple, and the guest next to you will open up the tray to make it easier to serve yourself some bacon. Aloha was everywhere!    I loved this place.

401158074,40,"Beautiful Location, Good resort",Pros  Great customer service – The staff at Hualalai is excellent and especially big shout outs to the staff at Kings Pond! We spent time there most days of our trip and they were always spectacular. But from the moment of arrival to departure we were always greeted with an Aloha and a smile. The concierge desk helped me secure a spot at a Luau on the day of when I should have planned better and in advance. One day I wanted to take a walk and managed to get lost and one of the golf pros insisted he would drive me to where I was trying to go even when I was just asking for directions lol. I can’t say enough good things about the warm and friendly staff.    Beautiful Location –Absolutely gorgeous location for this resort! We had an ocean golf view villa and the morning view over the course to the ocean was how I started every day. I don’t think you can get a bad room in the resort.    Trading Company – Great spot for a quick coffee and a late night treat. Excellent idea would love to see copied at some of the other Four Seasons!      Cons  Bungalow Layout – While the room is quite nice I didn’t like how close you are to the next guest. While sitting on the patio of my room could hear every word from my next door neighbour and im sure it was the same for them. Having stayed at other Four Seasons resorts where the space between rooms was so large it was like having your own bungalow this was a bit of a let down.    Food – I was not impressed with the menu and food quality at the resort. Everything was “fine” but nothing was spectacular or consistent. We found a curry we liked for dinner at ‘ULU and decided ok we will try that again two days later in room service and when it arrive was totally different from when we had in the restaurant. And the prices were really over the top even for a four seasons. I normally don’t complain about price in resorts like this as the cost is always high but usually I feel like im getting a good enough meal to deal with the 40% mark up. Sadly I never had anything at Hualalai that made me feel I was getting value for money.    Other Guests – The hotel seemed to be overwhelmed with companies having functions. The people all seemed to have a free weekend in vegas vibe and were often loud and disruptive. Several times at the quiet pool the attendant had to remind some group to keep it down. No problem with people having group functions as there was also a large wedding and that group was not as disruptive. After a point we just stopped going to the any swimming except Kings Pond because the others were overwhelmed with loud people talking about work or their political views and getting into fights. Very disappointing.    Overall I would recommend Hualalai for a visit. The Big Island is a very laid back and friendly place and the resort is very nice. I don’t know if I feel I got my money’s worth like I have at Four Seasons Koh Samui or Mauritius where even though the prices were higher than here I thought every penny spent was well worth it. If you can get a discount rate or even better get your company to pay it would be an awesome break. And if you do go make sure you visit Kings Pond!!,Aug 2016,July 2016,Traveled with family,,"Houston, Texas"
400663339,50,Truly a paradise,"Of all the Hawaiian islands and resorts we have visited, the FS Hualalai stood out as the best vacation we have had. We traveled with 3 children ranging in age from 7 months to 6 years old and the hotel staff went above and beyond to ensure our stay was comfortable. Check-in was done while we sat on the couches in the lobby and sipped POG juice (with rum for the adults) and were given leis. Our kids received welcome amenities (toys) in the room upon arrival which they were excited about. Call before arrival and give them the kids' names and ages. You can request kids robes, slippers and bath products too. The room was a good size and tastefully decorated with an island vibe. We had a second story room with great views of the King's Pond pool and the ocean. We opted for a second story room to get more privacy and more sunlight. The kids snorkeled in the King's Pond and fed the fish. (FYI you have to sign up at 10am sharp M-F for the afternoon Eagle Ray feeding). They swam in the family pool and the kids pool. We ordered from the poolside children's buffet every day for lunch (all they can eat from 11am to 2pm) and the food selection was pretty good although I wish they had healthier food options such as fish or broccoli. The ice cream bar from 3-4pm was also a hit.    As for resort dining, we didn't love the food at the Beach Tree restaurant although we didn't order the pasta. I recommend checking daily after 3pm with the concierge to get dinner reservations for the Resident's Beach House restaurant. We had a great dinner there beachside. We also enjoyed the sushi and souffle at the Ulu restaurant. Breakfast buffet was included in our room because we reserved with a FS Preferred Partner. The breakfast selection was out of this world. One thing that we didn't appreciate though at this property and also at another FS property we had stayed at is that they charge you for a hot breakfast buffet and don't tell you that you have the option of a cold buffet which is cheaper for both adults and kids. They just assume you had hot food. Also kids under 4 eat free but you have to tell the wait staff or else they will charge you as well. The food selection overall was great especially the mahi mahi wrap except for the poolside smoothies which were made from a pre-mixed base and were too sweet. Kids Club was complimentary for hotel guests and kids can stay alone if aged 5-12 otherwise under 5 they need to be accompanied by an adult.    Highly recommend the coffee drinks at the Trading company general store and Throwback Thursdays ice cream event from 4-6pm where you can get a scoop of ice cream for pennies.    Overall this hotel provided a week of fun activities for the kids and they were never bored. We only made 2 short day trips outside of the hotel because no one wanted to leave the property. All in all a very memorable vacation for all.",Aug 2016,July 2016,Traveled with family,Second floor room offers more privacy and more light,California

I have to admit the service is not the same level as FS Bora  bora. We were never offered food or drink service by the pool/beach, took forever to find chairs and I had to continue to fill out water up when usually they are the ones that do it. But when we entered our room they had a sweet photo of my family, a fruit tray, a cake I ordered for my husbands 8th Emmy Win and toys for the kids. I over heard a few other customers complaining so I'm thinking it's an off week. I will come back for sure and we love our room 1402.

399316974,20,No longer worth every penny.,"It makes me sad to write this review. I have been a huge fan of FS Hualalai - we have stayed 8 times and chose to celebrate several anniversaries and birthdays there. Unfortunately, the service has declined as the prices have risen to an astronomical level. It's still drop-dead gorgeous but the service was the reason we returned again and again. We have spent many, many thousands of dollars there over the years, specifically because I was able to eat there despite my severe food allergy. They always took great care of me but on our last two stays I felt like I was a burden to them. We hoped that it was a fluke when it happened the first time in 2014 and gave them another chance, but service was worse in 2015.    The kick-off to our stay was the welcome gift in my room that contained the very ingredient that will kill me. I know that they were aware of my allergy because I called and emailed before my stay (as I always do) and received a confirmation. Plus having stayed at Hualalai and at other Four Seasons properties multiple times, I know my allergy is in my guest profile.    I don't try to eat at places that I know can't accommodate my allergy, and I always avoid peak times at restaurants. I really am not high maintenance and would never insist that a restaurant serve me. I don't want anyone to fawn over me or make a big deal - I just want to have a nice dinner. Hualalai used to prepare amazing food for me so that I would have the same experience as other diners, and never made me feel like I was an imposition. This time I was told that my food could contain the allergen due to possible ""cross-contamination"". And then, after telling me that the food could kill me, they wanted to know if I still wanted it. Um - no.    The final straw was the phone call from management after my stay. I had filled out the guest survey card and received an email from a member of the food/beverage management team saying that he wanted to discuss staff training regarding food allergies. I was actually excited that they could use my experience to help the staff understand how to handle someone with a deadly allergy. Unfortunately, when the call came, he gave a lukewarm apology and asked if I would rather have the staff not tell me about possibility of cross-contamination.    At this level of resort, cross-contamination should not be an issue. I know they are capable of preparing food that I can eat, as they have done it many, many times. I just wanted the same experience that I've had there in the past. Yes, I have high expectations, but my expectations are based on my prior experiences at that very resort. And when you are paying $1,000 per night, they should be able to take a little extra care to avoid cross contamination on a crème brulee.    I don't know what caused the changes at Hualalai. They have raised their rates to the ridiculous and allowed their service to decline. I refuse to spend nearly $1,000 per night for the cheapest room and then be told that if I choose to eat the food they serve to me, I could have a life threatening reaction. We have been loyal repeat clients of Hualalai for many years, but now we will be staying somewhere else.",Jul 2016,October 2015,Traveled as a couple,,Illinois

First, let me say, the Big Island has unbelievable lava rock. It's a picturesque place and should not be missed if traveling to Hawaii. Staying on the Kona side at the Four Seasons is, in my opinion, the only choice. Excellent spread out gym, beautiful scenery (take a walk down the winding trail to the left by the beach), generous daily treats brought to the room, impeccable housekeeping, nice spa, lovely welcome, gorgeous grounds, healthy food (breakfast is outstanding), kind & generous staff.

We went for drinks in the evening at Beach Tree one night and Katie was our server - we went back for lunch the next day and had a different server, but Katie recognized us and stopped to say hi and chat for a bit - this was great! We spent a few hours at Palm Grove pool one day and Manny at the swim up bar was so friendly and kind. There are so many superb dining options, one of our favorites was ULU - we even went there for two dinners because that is how fantastic it was - their tableside poke was to die for! Justin was our server the first night and he took such good care of us - it was our last night celebrating our honeymoon (as I had put on our reservation notes) and he recognized this and did everything he could to make it special. There also happened to be a live musician performing right next to our ocean front table spot and it was just the cherry on top!

On site restaurants are very good but very expensive, you need to be willing to drive at least 10 minutes for alternatives.

During our first visit the resort was only at 30% capacity and service was spectacular, but now we go on holidays when it is at 100% and the service is equally as excellent. That's a testament the quality of this resort.    When we started going my children were very small and now they are adults, so we have seen every incarnation of visit one can have at this resort, from kiddy pool to swim up bar/adults only pool. Every single one of the trips has been perfection. One of the wonderful things about Hualalai is that anyone can have a great experience here. Traveling with kids, check; romantic getaway, check; a group of girlfriends, check; and so on. The grounds are spread out with many different areas and pools, so one can have the experience they are seeking.    Since Kathleen Horrigan, the first manager of this resort, laid down the rules for how to run it, the staff have been perfectly trained to make guests feel like they are loved and important. There are employees who have been here since the beginning and it's like seeing family when we get back to Hualalai. Have to give a shout out to Cora who's smiling face is always a pleasure to see when one goes to Ulu Restaurant for the most delectable buffet breakfast (possibly the best bacon on earth btw). However, there are many other staff members who will remember you and welcome you back like an old friend. What better way to start a vacation.    We were there last week and I actually think the hotel has gotten better. I didn't think it was possible, but there is not a single thing that I could note that could've been better. The setting, the staff, the rooms, the spa, the golf course, the exercise facilities are all fantastic. Note: this is not for anyone on a budget, but you get what you pay for and I can tell you that what you spend here is worth every cent.

393993238,40,"Beautiful Hotel, But Not Five Star","We visited the Four Seasons in July of 2016. Below is a summary of what worked and what did not. This hotel has many of the physical attributes that would make it a five star hotel, but it is lacking in too many service areas to be a true five star hotel.    What works:    1. The grounds. Impeccably maintained, beautiful. Probably the best of any of the hotels on any of the islands.  2. The setting. It is obvious that a tremendous amount of care went into the placement of each room and restaurant.    What is lacking:    1. Very little sophistication with checking in. I was checking in with my family and we had multiple rooms. I did not want the rest of the family to have to worry about the costs of the rooms and was giving the woman checking us in every high sign that we could do the check-in privately at her desk rather than have the entire family sitting on couches and chairs while she went over everything. Then they tried to up-sell us on rooms for a mere $5,000 extra. The up-sell was bad enough, but to do it vocally in front of my entire family was truly awful form. When you are paying well over $3,000 a night, this should not be your first introduction to a hotel. Left a bad taste in my mouth, especially as a first impression.  2. Continuing with the service, it was hit or miss. We had dinner at the Grille and the waiter was awkward in every sense. He managed to tell us that he needed to go take care of another table ahead of us because they were ""difficult""....okay....we then learned far too many unsolicited details of his personal life. He then completely forgot about our salads and they arrived with dinner. The whole thing was uncomfortable, especially when paying well over $100 per person for a middle of the road restaurant.  3. We were at the hotel pools for five days. On not one of those days did we ever get approached to order drinks, etc. Each time we wanted something we had to track down one of the workers at the pool area. They were very friendly and happy to do so, but true five star resorts do not have you chasing down employees to pay them for items such as drinks.    We walked out feeling like it needed some serious improvement on the service side prior to thinking about returning. For the amount they charge there are other true five star hotels in tropical locations that have it all figured out.

It was a little far from some of the pools but it was quieter and the self- parking was really convenient. I would book this type of room again without hesitation. We were celebrating our 5th Anniversary during our trip. Everyone wished us a happy anniversary and we received a complementary bottle of champagne.    There are four main pools (one for families, a quiet pool, an adult pool, and a snorkel pool). I absolutely loved the snorkel pool (kings pond) and kept returning there to see the fish and eagle ray. My husband prefers the beach so we also spent some time there as well. We saw lots of sea turtles which was a real treat! The beach and pool staff were very attentive. Chairs were always available. It was so relaxing we were a bit torn between our desires to explore the sites of the Big Island and staying put in the resort. The adult pool (palm groove) is beautiful. We went one evening before sunset and had the pool to ourselves! I was a little disappointed when I went the next day around 4 and half the pool was closed (there was some type of special event).    We ate most of our meals at the resort. We really liked Ulu (at there for breakfast and dinner several times). The farmers market skillet was probably the best breakfast I've ever had. The other restaurants were OK.    This resort is really a 5 star experience. The big island is also a great place to visit!

There were 2 pools we liked, one had a swim up bar, the other was huge, both overlooking the ocean.(There is a kid friendly pool also) The grounds are beautiful and all the restaurants/pools/fitness are a quick walk away from your room. Our room was in Building 30 near my favorite bar/restaurant right on the sand and open at 11am for lunch thru dinner. Our room overlooked the adult pool and ocean and was perfect for us with a large balcony on the 2nd floor. The resort was quiet and they do have signs requesting no cell phones around the pools. The breakfast is unbelievable with everything and anything you want. The tennis courts are great along with the spin classes they offer for a fee. I appreciated the laundry facilities as we did need to use them. There is a beach path you can walk/run for several miles that is amazing. This is truly a gem and we will be back. A bonus is its 10 minutes to the airport and 15 minutes to Kona, so we left the resort to go into Kona everyday for lunch and/or dinner.",Jul 2016,June 2016,Traveled as a couple,Building 33 is the most private.

The quality of the service remains unparalleled and does not waver year to year. It is an incredibly beautiful spot and an unusual design that contributes to its beauty. Instead of one large building housing all the hotel rooms the hotel is built in small 8 room buildings in groups of 6 to 8 building semicircle groupings facing the beach. This makes for a widely spread out low density resort.

It has several swimming pools and restaurants, 8 tennis courts (with amazing tennis instructors) and a great gym.    The only one comment I have is that the kids club can provide a better program. With so much to explore the focus shouldn't be on video games and electronics. The ladies at the kids club are very nice and professional but somehow the program is disappointing and it hasn't changed for a decade.

The room and furnishings were gorgeous . We had a view of kings pond and had a fabulous view of the ocean. Housekeeping always came while we were gone and room was always made up very well!    The pools at the hotel had a great setup. Our favorite was the sea shell pool since we travelled with our 6 year old daughter. We also spent time at the quieter pool while she attended kids for all seasons .    The kids club was great. The activities offered were wonderful. Our daughter really enjoyed attending and meeting other kids at the resort. She was able to play tennis, do sea shell art, go on a scavenger hunt, beach combing, feed the eagle Ray in the pond and swimming.    The restaurants on property were very good. Our favorite was the Beach House and Uli was also good. Lots of kids would play together on the lawn and beach while waiting for food or after dinner and it was just such a nice atmosphere!!    The Luau was fabulous! The buffet was delicious and had a ton of choices. They had lots of activities to do before the show started including lai makings and some crafts.

I was very disappointed in the snorkeling experience because I booked private lessons and when I arrived they made a mistake on the booking and we were treated rudely, but that was a minor thing. We got over it, Now, for the golf, it was definitely a five-star experience. from arrival to tee-off, everything was perfect. There are some incredible views of the ocean from many of the wholes. This is definitely a golf course you will want to play.

Our family of 4 rented one of the on site residences and paid a little extra to be part of the ""club"" so to speak. This allowed us 100% access to amenities. We dined at all of the restaurants - delicious. We took advantage of the cultural center (shell necklaces and ukelele lessons) , poolside arts and crafts, rented a comfy cabana bed for a day at the beach (otherwise regular loungers were included) and snorkeled in the lagoon. The property is expansive and beautifully landscaped. It faces west so set aside ""sunset"" hour every night. It is a gorgeous show.  Golf - we don't golf but the courses looked amazing with views of the ocean, lava fields and tropical gardens.  Service - every person we interacted with went above and beyond to help us with any and all requests. Their effort was so genuine that my 11 year old even commented on how ""nice"" everyone was acting. We stay at the four seasons often because of this consistent level of service given not just to the adults but to our children as well.

386725964,50,Best Wedding Night imaginable,"I need to preface this review by saying that we did not stay at this property - we always rent a condo when in Kona. And I apologize that this review is 5 years overdue. That being said, my husband and I ran away to Hawaii and on May 19, 2011, we were married on the beach not far from the Four Seasons. After our sunset ceremony, we had reservations for dinner elsewhere, but we had some time before dinner and decided to go to the Four Seasons to have our first cocktail as Mr and Mrs. From the moment we pulled up to the valet, we were treated like royalty. We were welcomed by the valet and asked if we were celebrating anything. My husband informed him that we just got married and we're headed to the Beachtree for a drink. He told us to head into the lobby where a manager was waiting for us. He said ""welcome Me and Mrs Foster, congratulations and we're glad to have you here"". He then directed us down the beautiful path to the Beachtree where the tikis were lit and a band was playing. Couldn't have been more perfect. The hostess was waiting for us and again greeted us with a ""Congratulations Mr and Mrs Foster!"" And had a perfect table on the edge of the deck waiting for us. The next person to come to us was the waitress and she had two glasses and a bottle of champagne compliments of the manager. We then proceeded to order cocktails and appetizers and loved our short experience so much that we decided to stay for dinner. They moved us to a table and a new waitress came over again with the first words being ""Congratulations, Mr & Mrs Foster. We got to talking and explained to her that we had dated in high school, lost touch for 26 years and then found each other again. She loved our story so much that she told all of her tables. One couple who were regulars at the resort sent us over a drink and then had the band play a song for us for our first dance as husband and wife. Dinner was fantastic, they brought us a special dessert and our wedding night couldn't have been more perfect!

It takes a lot to impress us. With that being said, I can say without hesitation that the Four Seasons on the big island is the by far the most incredible place we'd ever said. The service, the amenities, the atmosphere. Its all perfect. What can I say that hasn't already been shared here in these reviews???    Well a word of advice. If there is anything in your room or with your stay that is not up to par, do not hesitate to bring it up to management. On the night we arrived in our standard ocean view room, the air conditioning would not go below 68 degrees. We have a health issue that requires the room to be much cooler. When maintenence couldn't get the temperature lowered we were moved to a room they believed they could get cooler...A one bedroom suite! There was no additional charge to us. The room was roughly 1200sq ft with a second bathroom that contained a steam shower.

There aren't many beaches on the Big Island, but there are 3+ at the Four Seasons. The landscaping, the resort lay out the decor is just perfect. Service was flawless. Housekeeping was over the top eg. folding clothes that I left on the back of a chair. The rooms look brand new and I find that unbelieveable. I know the facility is 20+ years old, so after a couple days I just looked for any flaw I could find...and I didn't succeed. Everything was flawless except the main restaurant. There are a lot of rather aggressive sparrows who free load off the tables. What can the 4S do??? If you have a phobia for birds then you might want to sit well inside or stay away.    I wouldn't stress about the location of your room reservation. After walking around the resort I can't imagine that any of them are bad. If I could go back tomorrow and stay in the worst room on the resort, I would in a heart beat.    There is so much to do and perhaps the best thing to do is nothing. I don't know if I have ever felt soooooo relaxed.    One suggestion, the Four Seasons has partnered with the Hawaiian Legacy Reforestation Initiative and they have committed to planting half a million Koa trees where Koa forests once stood on the east side of the island. (90% of Hawaii's forests have either been degraded or destroyed) There is a program where you can personally plant a Koa tree. The tree can be memorial, a celebration, what ever you want it to be. Your tree is planted with a unique RFID number and GPS coordinates. You can watch it grow on the internet or go back and visit it personally...which I plan to do year after year. :) Aloha",Jun 2016,May 2016,Traveled as a couple,Any room will be great.,Tucson

The hotel lobby is expansive and open so one can feel and smell the ocean breeze. The grounds are well maintained and the staff is very gracious. Enjoying a drink in the bar or dining in one of the restaurants oceanside will make anyone relax. The resort and golf course make up a large area of land so it never feels crowded.

There were plenty of beach chairs to go around, we didn't make it down to the beach until 10am at the earliest and didn't have any trouble getting a chair in the area we wanted.

I also enjoyed how the Four Seasons allows local Kona Coffee growers to set up a table and sample their products. Meeting the people behind the organic products we consume is always nice.    Both nights we stayed at the FS, we ate at Ulu Grill... the service was outstanding and the food was beyond mouthwatering. SO GOOD. The octopus appetizer is to die for.    We also had an opportunity to workout in their gym/spa and snorkel in their lagoon. The gym is partly outdoors and the equipment is top notch. The lagoon, which was packed with thousands of fish and even an eagle ray made for pretty convenient snorkeling, since we didn't have to go looking around to find giant schools of fish.

374366029,50,"ok, believe the hype","My boyfriend and I had a wonderful time at the four seasons Hualalai, with a few minor glitches. I set the trip and itinerary up in advance as a surprise for his birthday. I had several emails with the concierge who were overall helpful in planning the stay. But upon confirmation of our itinerary, there were multiple mistakes in dates and times of our requests (car rental, spa day, day bed etc.) Luckily I saw the mistakes before arrival and was able to have everything fixed. I also had requested a room near the Palm Grove, and not only did we not get a Palm Grove room, there was not even a record of our request. When we were handed the physical itinerary upon arrival at the hotel, there were multiple other people's information and itineraries also in the envelope. The second morning there was a woman speaking on her lanai with her cellphone on loud speaker phone, for over 40 minutes while we were trying to enjoy breakfast in bed. We let the service know, but ultimately we requested to have our room changed. Finally when the manager heard about our various difficulties, she promised that she would meet us that night for dinner (wink wink) and then never showed up. So we were disappointed with that. Finally, when our rental car was delivered, it was very, very dirty from both trees and birds, remarkably so.    All of that aside, the food and service were wonderful. Highly recommend the foot massages at the pool side. It was a wonderland for adults. We loved our morning at the spa, the day bed rental, all of the food was delicious and we did not get bored of the dining options. It was exquisitely beautiful.

Our room was very accommodating, as well as the welcoming staff. But I noticed little amenities were missing...for turndown service, there was no bottled water provided but, rather, a carafe of water with a cup beside our bed stand. So, I requested the water be delivered, which was never necessary before. Also, the ice bucket was not filled, as before. Small things, yes...but all these small amenities add up  to the experience of staying here. Having an appetizer and wine at the Grill that night was also a disappointment. We ordered something which we did not expect and mentioned it to the server, who also did not know what it was...  But he offered to take it off the bill, but we ate it regardless, and paid for it. We remember in pre-Michael Dell days when this place was the best place to be...but not anymore. He has run it into the ground because he is an inexperienced entrapeneur and, because of his poor decisions to keep it in the top CondeNast resorts, he is failing.

374142029,50,"Ridiculously lavish, in a good way","In my experience, the difference between a $200 hotel and a $400 hotel is a slightly nice room. Four Seasons Hualalai puts a lie to that. While VERY expensive, I've never had a better hotel/resort experience.    It began with an individual at the lobby taking us aside, serving us Mai Tais in coconuts, and telling us about the resort. No line waiting or the usual check-in grind (which I've experienced even at very expensive hotels).'    The service we experienced the same level of service throughout our stay. Every member of the staff was courteous and they always strived to learn and use your names at every opportunity.    Even though we were told the resort was mostly booked, it NEVER felt crowded. It was obviously intended this way and you never have an issue of getting lounge chairs, seats at the restaurants, or space at the top notch spa/gym.    Rooms are spacious, gorgeous, and feature fabulous balconies that we spent a lot of time on. Even though we had one of the more standard rooms, the view was still fantastic, with a view over the golf course and the ocean in the background.    Though we went into town one day I can only image how easy it is to stay here for a week and never leave. Just make sure you are able and willing to not be thinking about the costs of everything.

373905300,50,OMG - spectacular!,"We stayed at two resorts on this particular visit to the Big Island - the Fairmont Orchid, and the Four Seasons. Both were excellent, and different to each other. We loved the Fairmont Orchid as a solid 4.5 star hotel with a great beach at the front where (in the mornings) you can snorkel with wild turtles.    However we could definitely see the difference once we arrived at the Four Seasons, which is a true 5 star resort, and it showed in all the many extra features. Every part of the experience was a notch above anything else we'd experienced. Our room was incredibly comfortable - really luxurious, with a wonderful mattress topper that made sinking into the mattress at night like sinking into clouds. The view from our room, and our bed - OMG it was spectacular!!!! Such a treat! We were in room 813, and had a beautiful view over the snorkeling lagoon and the ocean - very peaceful, and amazingly quiet. In fact, that's one thing that really impressed me about the Four Seasons - it was so well laid out, that even though we were part of a very large group present at the resort, we didn't feel like there were a lot of people around. We loved this sense of added privacy that the resort offered us.    I can't fault anything in the room - it was all perfect. The only thing I would change is that the towels had a strong fragrance to them due to the washing detergent (we'd prefer a hotel choose a fragrance-free option for those who are sensitive to chemical-smells).    I loved snorkeling in the snorkel pool. It is quite deceiving - once I got my fins and mask and went into it, the water (while a bit cold) was very deep in parts - up to 5 yards deep I'd say. And it was stocked with the most wonderful array of coral reef fish, and even a Spotted Ray. I had such a great time discovering the many creatures in the snorkel pool - it's a ""must do"".    And yes, I did have a Lomi Lomi massage - absolutely fantastic, and my body has felt great for days afterwards. I also worked out at the gym most mornings, and that was very impressive - it's such a large gym that it's spread out between various buildings (all adjacent to each other), so that the cardio equipment is in one room, the resistance training in another room, etc. That's a great idea, as it again meant we felt like we were around smaller groups of people, with more privacy.

372426196,40,"Service not up to Four Seasons standards, but beautiful location","Disappointed by this Four Seasons. We are loyal Four Seasons clients and have been to properties all over the world. Hualalai was crowded and the standard of service was just not up to par. First, some positives- the property and location are stunning. Service was generally very friendly. The spa was beautiful, and food was good. We had a nice time overall, and even a subpar Four Seasons is miles ahead of any other resort. But I have to be honest at these prices and distance to get to Hawaii, it was far from perfect. The resort was so crowded, we could not get into the adult only pool, Palm Grove, after the first day, and had to be waitlisted multiple days for the other quiet pool. You don't travel 11 hrs and pay upwards of $1000 a night to be waitlisted at a pool. If this was a Hyatt or Marriott, sure, but not at a Four Seasons. One thing my husband and I have always commented on is how the Four Seasons excels at always making their resorts seem like they're not crowded. Definitely not the case here. There was a large company group that arrived the day after we did, and they clogged up the pools, restaurants, etc. Hualalai should not book so many guests that you can't get a seat at the pool. Utterly ridiculous. Since the pools were out, we sat on the beach a few days. Service there was terrible. Beach service was so infrequent to get a drink or order food that it was really frustrating and very un-Four Seasons. Also the beach here is very rocky and shallow and not good for swimming. I had been forewarned about that by other reviewers so I was expecting that, but I was not expecting such poor service on the beach. Our last day we were waitlisted yet again for the pool, so headed to the beach chairs. After sitting there for 10 minutes with no attendant in sight to come set up chairs, we gave up and were headed back to our room to hang out- ridiculous!! Luckily a seat opened up at the pool on our way to our room. But that's just unacceptable for a Four Seasons In general service was just not Four Seasons-level. We had AWFUL service at Ulu one night- we couldn't wait to get out of there. It would have been awful at any restaurant, but for a Four Seasons resort to have service this bad was appalling. The one day we were able to get a seat at Palm Grove, I tried to order a shave ice. The server said I couldn't. I then asked if someone could go down and get one for me, being very pregnant and the Palm Grove chaises are low to the ground, it wasn't that easy for me to get up and down. He just flat out said no. At most Four Seasons, they never tell you ""no"" outright- they try their best to get it done, or nicely offer you some kind of alternative. Not here. Another day, I went to King's Pool to inquire about snorkeling. I walked up to the attendant and asked, ""so how does snorkeling work here?"" A legitimate question, being that King's Pool is not the ocean and sort of a unique environment. Also I was wondering if you could rent equipment there, etc- a general question. The attendant seem annoyed and replied- ""what do you mean how does it work?"", not in a nice tone. Just overall across the resort little things like this that were just not up to snuff. We had a lot of great service, particularly the breakfast servers at Ulu every morning, but there were enough inconsistencies to really be glaring overall. I emailed the resort manager after our return in fairness before posting this review. He was apologetic and offered an upgrade should we ever return. Which was nice, but I doubt we'll ever go back.

370933558,50,"Expensive, but worth it","We stayed at the Four Seasons Hualalai in October 2015. This is my favorite month to go to Hawaii as most children are back to school and the resort isn't so crazy.    My biggest complaint about the Four Season chain is they do not seem to track their frequent guests and travelers who support their properties worldwide and treat them accordingly with preferential room selections. I had called and spoke to the in-house reservations team to find out where we wanted to be on the property and she put us over by King's Pond and blocked out the room for our 9 day stay. When we arrived, they put us in a completely different area that was by the adult pool and basically we stared at the cement path and the handicap lift into the pool, even though we paid for Prime Ocean View. You can imagine after flying 14 hours to get there to celebrate a birthday how disappointed we were. The bellman got the Asst. Resort Manager involved and he moved us to one of the most beautiful rooms on the property. (shame on me for not retaining his name). From that point on we had an amazing stay. People ask me why the view is so important to me. We live four houses from the beach and have a beach view from our front balcony, so if I pay for a Prime Ocean View that is what I expect to receive.    The layout of the resort is beautiful. The grounds are amazing. In my opinion, why ever leave the resort. We drove to the other side to see the waterfalls and while it was beautiful, I do not know if it was worth fighting the traffic and the 1.5 -2.0 hour drive each way to see this. I love the idea of a children's pool. We don't have any children, but we certainly want them to have fun, just not at our expense. The children's pool was crazy, floating noodles, pool inflatables, water guns...they were having an amazing time and fun so we watched with enthusiasm. I have read some other reviews, and unfortunately ""staking out your claim"" on deck space and chairs probably could be a challenge. I would fault the pool staff managing that area for not policing the chair policy better.  We went to the quiet pool. Which was a combination of adults and some children. Bottom line it is suppose to be a quiet pool, no cell phones and no screaming. Of course you always have a guest who think they are more important than the ""rules"" and sit at the pool and scream on their cell phone.....we found that rude and were disappointed the staff didn't intervene. We met several children in the pool that were very engaging and fun. They were so well behaved, swam, had fun, but bottom line their parents didn't let them scream, play marco polo or disturb others. We were amazed. In particuliar there were these twins who were each 7 and every day they would swim up to me and I would ask them what they did the night before. They would give me a run down of their whole night. The vibe of this pool and he close proximity to the restaurants is why we didn't ever go to the ""adult pool"". We walked by that pool and it was utilized but there was no reason to go over it especially since we were having so much fun at the quiet pool. The staff at the pool was amazing. I cannot stress how they go out of their way to secure you a chair set-up towels and get you water. Don't want to buy any drinks, no worries they will bring you fresh ice cold water as fast as you can drink it. The frozen drinks are great and since the service bar is close to this pool they come out frozen and great. My only complaint would be that this property appears to be a training ground for the Four Seasons Corporation so you have a lot of college graduates doing their rotations. It is such an amazing property, I would like to see more Hawaiians working at this property. The main draw besides the beach, to the Mauna Kea, is the staff as they are predominantly Hawaiian. Such a minor complaint, but having a little more ""aloha spirit"" would put this property off the charts.    Let's address the beach. When people say there is no beach it isn't an exaggeration. The resort is constantly moving sand and adding sand to have a mow strip width of a beach but it is not a swimming beach. If this your thing, I agree with other reviewers and I would suggest staying at the Mauna Kea. It is a lovely resort with a beautiful beach. The Four Seasons has some chaise lounges in the sand but navigating the lava rock is not advised and dangerous. We ate at the resident's beach club and we saw sand, ocean and sea turtles.    Dining- We had the Amex platinum card breakfast package. They push the buffet and by the time you add everything up, it really is your best value. It's the guest's responsibility to manage their dietary restrictions (hint: don't overeat). I was a little annoyed that each day we were charged a supplement for the ""included"" breakfast. It made it difficult to understand all of these ""extra"" charges. For the money they charge nickel and dining me each day for a supposed ""benefit"" became aggravating. I would prefer to give the money to their servers. When breakfast and tip is included we always give the server an extra tip to benefit them, not the property. I wish this property would review this policy. We stay a lot at the Ritz Carlton as well (Maui and Orlando) and their buffet is equally elaborate and in fact slightly better and its just included as part of the FHR program. I also agree with some of the other posts, many mornings they were just ""out"" of your favorite selections. This should be unacceptable to any Food and Beverage Mgr. If you are out, then cook or make some more so ALL guests can enjoy every selection. A lot of the food under the mesh baskets tends to be cold and not refreshed. I think better management of the ""buffet"" could occur. That being said all of the hosting and serving staff in Ulu works real hard and goes out of their way to start your day off on a perfect note.    We ate at the Hualalai Grill on our last night. We were kind of surprised that the reception staff didn't talk this restaurant up more than they did. They made it seem like a ""special occasion"" place. In fact, it is the best restaurant at the resort. While the a/c is not working properly or no existent, it was very warm in the restaurant. That would be the only drawback as with the kitchen operating full speed, the restaurant inside was warm. The dress code is whatever. You can wear nice shorts and a polo shirt or you can wear slacks and a dressier shirt. It's all up to you. The fine dining part is the fact that the food is what you would expect in a fine dining establishment. The atmosphere is casual and the food is suburb. One night we left the property to eat at Tommy Bahama's at another resort and I will say the pricing was the same and the food was not up to the same par as the Grill so why would you want to leave the property. We found this to be the case the entire stay. We rented a car so we tried to go into town and eat, but the choices were horrible so again I would ask anyone, why leave the property, especially if you want to drink. The concierge sent us into town to this pizza restaurant and it was very casual but the food and salads were amazing. But does one really go to Hawaii to have pizza and salad?? Probably Not. We liked the Beach Tree, but it would be nice if they varied there menu a little more because your selections start to become mundane.    The best kept secret is the Resident's Beach Club. No one mentions it and it is a short stroll down the cement path. Lunch there is great and so is dinner. The pricing is cheaper and you basically are sitting outside at a cafe. We had this amazing server who was hard to understand but she was so friendly and funny (again her name escapes me) She has worked at the property for years through all of the changes and loves her job and it shows. She also knows she is very hard to understand and jokes about it with little quips. I much prefer this experience to the homogenized ""in training"" experience at a Hawaiian resort. We have all of these vacation photos with her in it. Again to remind us of the fun experience we had.    Overall this place is amazing. I don't necessarily think one needs to rent a car. It is so close to the airport that a short cab ride will suffice. If you have children, you might want to go to the local Costco and load up on snacks for your room. I also will say the guest profile here is very different. The Hualalai guest is less pretentious and snobby, as is the case with the Maui property. There aren't any wannabe ""movie moguls"" running all over the property being obnoxious and ""acting"" important. We met singles, couples, and families by the pool who were from all over the country and world and very friendly and engaging. This also added to our overall enjoyment of the property.

Pretty spectacular sunset too.  One of the five pools is the Kings Pond, salt water, stocked with 93 species of fish and a totle of 4000 of them, and the best thing is that every day it gets really windy on the beaches around noon, but at the pond the water is smooth and clear all day. Snorkle equipment is free, and the staff is great about getting everyone set up. Twice we were the ONLY people in the entire pond. If you want to go Mauna Kea Beach Hotel for the snorkeling (fantastic) you can rent the equipment from Four Seasons and take it for the whole day out on other island beaches.

The grounds are extraordinarily beautiful, pools meticulously cared for, and service is some of the best anywhere. Unfortunately, and while I am sure this may vary from visit to visit, the hotel this time seemed overrun with misbehaved children whose parents could not be bothered to look after them. On top of this, one would not have to eavesdrop to hear frequent complaints from guests on insignificant details. The Beach Tree restaurant seemed practically off limits given the chaos that would erupt around dinner time (complete with children throwing footballs at the feet of a beautiful hula performance). Two promotional groups also cycled in and out of the resort during our stay -- complete with neon-light luaus -- that detracted somewhat from the overall serenity of the stay.    Ultimately, it was not difficult to relax and enjoy our stay, and this is one of the best resorts you can find. The staff at the Residents' Beach Club made for an exceptionally welcomed respite to some other locations at the hotel, the housekeeping staff is phenomenal, and the spa services are excellent. But, the expense of the stay warrants being able to enjoy dinner at any restaurant on the grounds without screaming children running through like it is Disneyland.",May 2016,April 2016,Traveled as a couple,Rooms and suites near the adult pool are beautiful and tend to be quieter.,"Washington DC, District of Columbia"

368861763,50,Welcome to Paradise!,"The only drawback to The Four Seasons Hualalai is that you have to leave it. My wife and I were fortunate to honeymoon here back in 2000 (and, return a year later for our first anniversary, vowing to return frequently...) Then kids and life intervene and the long trek from New York to the Big Island gets back-burnered.    So, after many years of regaling our children about the wonders of FSH, we made it back. We've spent the last seven nights here with our just turned 14 year-old son and just turned 11 year-old daughter. And, we now have another two believers in the magic of FSH. We feel very fortunate to leave here with countless memories of this time and place which will put smiles on our collective faces for years to come.    From amazing food and drink to the wonderful rooms paired with the beyond attentive and responsive service -- all provided amidst a breathtaking backdrop -- FSH is truly a special place in the world.

368803955,50,"""Luxurious Tropical resort""","We had heard so many great things about the Four Seasons Hualalai prior to our visit and visited with very high expectations. Happy to share that our expectations were exceeded, and we were blown away by how beautiful the property is! When you think of Hawaii, this is exactly what you expect complete with the staff welcoming you with a lei.They also have a nightly conch blower and a man who lights all the tiki torches at night. The property is spread out over many acres, with lots of beach access and multiple pools so it doesn't feel overcrowded (we went during Spring Break which was crowded but because the property is large, it didn't feel tightly packed) Loved that you could sea turtles on the beach every day (a more pleasant experience than Turtle beach in Oahu) The hotel is only 2 stories, and our ground floor suite had a lovely veranda and outdoor shower. While the rooms are not super modern, they can be described as luxuriously Hawaiian. The food was excellent! We enjoyed a delicious dinner at Ulu our first night, so we dined here every night. I ordered a la carte breakfast at Ulu as well, and the pancakes were the best I've ever had! Service at the beach was attentive without being over-bearing, constantly refilling water and checking on you. Nice touch that they offer to clean your sunglasses! Spa was great - steam room has clear glass walls, allowing you to view the landscaping outside. I loved my deep-tissue massage in the private huts, where you can hear the waterfalls. Also had a great facial but was in a typical room that could be in a spa anywhere, so would go with the massage if you have to choose based on the experience. Gym looked very nice but I preferred the 4 mile run around the property, pass the lava rocks and golf course. We did not leave the property as it was fabulous! This is one of our favorite beach resorts and islands...we love it so much, we decided to get married here in the Fall!

368605373,40,"Beautiful, but not a real beach","We stayed 5 nights in a beautiful room overlooking the tranquility pool. Staff is great and very friendly everywhere on the property.  We found the food and drinks inconsistent-never bad but for the price you expect to be wowed and we often were not. We found the best meals at the Residents Beach club and ate there daily. Ulu buffet was good but we don't eat near enough for breakfast to be $100 for 2 people. They did make us special pancakes when we asked and that was very nice.  My biggest reason for only 4 stars is they make it seem like a beach resort and you just can't get in the ocean there. There is a very small shallow lagoon area but there are lots of rocks and urchins and I never saw anyone go in. I can go in a pool anywhere, when I go to Hawaii I want to go in the Ocean!

368537581,50,Post Ski Season Vacation,"Beautiful property with a wonderful staff! This was our second visit (we went last spring, same time) and we stayed for 10 nights. Breakfast at ULU each morning with Ivonne, Kelly, Fernanda, Maggie and Sam - who makes some killer smoothies! Try the coconut pancakes! Whatever the juice of the day is, I guarantee it will be super tasty! Spending your day on the beach in front of the BeachTree Pool was relaxation at it's finest. Mikayla, Ashley, Letisha, Drew, Keone, Mayson & Maila will keep you in ice water, little treats throughout the day and even clean your sunglasses. Don't turn down the watermelon rum popsicle! Resident's Beach House is a fun laid back alternative to ULU or Hualalai Grille, you can order half portions of some entrees which is nice, especially if you want to save room for dessert. Natsuko, Tyson, and Shelley took great care of us! The seafood linguine is excellent!! Hualalai Grille was fantastic! Probably our favorite meal was the Chateaubriand, we had to have it twice. Chef James rolls it out on a cart and carves it tableside. Dee-lish! Robbie is our favorite waiter, and Jeff the bartender is a blast to play trivia with! Tasio and Jason also took great care of us. Had my first LomiLomi massage with Michael and got up off the table taller. I highly recommend a massage to undo the joys of air travel, and recommend trying the LomiLomi, you're in Hawaii after all! Loved lunch and BeachTree, (BI Burger, tacos, and don't miss the coconut lemonade!) but don't recommend BeachTree for dinner. Too many children running about. Which brings me to my only complaint - too many unattended children. Frightening, really, when one considers the dangers of the ocean alone. Tearing up signage, ripping branches off trees, with oblivious parents. I understand that the parents are paying to be there, but so am I and I don't want to eat my lunch while your kid stands next to me picking his nose. Children under 12 should be accompanied by parents at all times and a policy along those lines would undoubtedly be appreciated by guests traveling without children.",Apr 2016,April 2016,Traveled as a couple,"First floor units have outdoor shower, second floor units have no one walking above you",colorado

Pool attendants were also attentive for the most part.    However, we found the restaurant staff and food to be inconsistent. Waiters started out attentive in getting our order and delivering food but sort of wandered off after that and didn't notice empty water glasses or bothered to clear dishes. We found the food to be inconsistent as well, some items were perfectly prepared and others were over cooked and dry.

367875660,50,Four Seasons Excellence Defined,"Our family of 5 had heard nothing but rave reviews for this Four Seasons, so we decided to split a stay on the Big Island between Hualalai and the venerable Mauna Kea (the latter due to its perfect beach). The Four Seasons location is very convenient, just 15 minutes from the Kona airport, and nicely spread in groups of units across the property with a Balinese vibe. One of the best and defining features of the Four Seasons properties, in my view, is the consistent excellence of their on-site food offerings. All three of their main restaurants were simply outstanding (just like the Maui Four Seasons) - Beach Tree, Ulu Ocean Grill and Hualalai Grille - and they provide enough variety that there's really no reason to leave the property to eat. Ulu Ocean Grill was our favorite, both for the sushi/seafood and post-card perfect layout/views at the ocean's edge (just Google Image Search it). The pool scene runs a full spectrum from ""adults only"" to ""quite/older kids OK"" to ""pure kids-focused pool."" Additionally, there is a unique ""King's Pond,"" which is an enclosed tidal pool with fish for snorkeling. Tennis facilities and pro staff were great. The only disappointment, which we knew about in advance, is that the beach has lots of lava rocks and so is not at all suitable for boogie boarding or body surfing (unfortunately this is a favorite activity for our kids, ages 10/13/15). This is specifically why we split our trip between Hualalai and the Mauna Kea, which has one of the nicest beaches in the world. At Hualalai, we stayed in the wonderful Anelakai Suite, right on the ocean and at the edge of the property abutting the deserted Kona Village Resort (still closed from Tsunami damage). As a 'bonus' for booking that suite, we were warmly welcomed over e-mail by Stephanie Malakie, our ""Suite Experience Manager"" - a position we've not encountered before. Essentially this property appears to be testing the allocation a small team of dedicated concierge professionals to these larger, more expensive suites. It is a fantastic idea that will hopefully propagate to other Four Seasons locations. Stephanie and her team really ""owned"" our vacation happiness from before arriving until literally our moment of departure. Stephanie and her team wer a big point of differentiation for us at this property, and really unique/unlike anything we've experienced before - we're much more likely to return as a result of this degree of personal aloha treatment (Mahalo!).",Apr 2016,April 2016,Traveled with family,Anelakai and rooms by King's Pond are at edge of property and felt more sequestered,"San Francisco, California"

365835964,30,a little disappointed,"this place is by far the biggest Four Seasons resort we have been to. Perhaps that's the problem....    Hubby and I had the best vacay ever last Feb at the Four Seasons in Lanai. it felt intimate, and staff were always so helpful and so considerate. We had a slightly different experience here at the Hualalai. The staff were not as helpful. They were well trained, and definitely were friendly, but it didnt feel genuine. For instance, booking excursions was like pulling teeth with the concierge. Instead of just recommend fun tours, we were given 20 brochures. The concierge also corrected the way I re-folded the brochure, and also asked me to ""define hike"" when we asked her for spots that may be fun to go hiking at....    We stayed at one of the specilaty suites on the resort. Our flight was scheduled to leave at 10pm the day we checked out. Not that we are asking for special accommodations at all costs, but the suite we stayed a week in was NOT being cleaned, nor did anyone else check in after we checked out (we know that because we sat across from our suite all afternoon and evening staring at it)...why cant they just let us still use the suite for a few hours instead of letting us wonder like nomads on the resort our luggage in storage at the front desk? Again, just didn't seem like they cared. It's one thing if the suite we stayed at was going to be used by other guests...but it stayed empty all night! And they didnt even clean the room!!! It felt very commercialized and the connection on a personal level just wasn't there.    We loved Lanai so much, so we wanted to check out other resort. Now we know that not all FSRs are the same!

364489751,40,Mostly hits ... a couple misses.,"This sums it up. I sent this to the hotel, but never heard back from them.    Our plane arrived from the Bay Area in the late morning. It was easy for us to locate the Four Seasons Hostess at the airport. She was pleasant and helped us to our bags and car. Transfer to Hotel with Richard in a local cab was excellent. Richard was delightful and started our vacation off in a good way. As a side note, Richard was there to take us back to the airport at the conclusion of our visit. He is a good guy.    We were welcomed to the hotel nicely by the valet staff. Check-in was a little less warm than other experiences we have had. Our room was far from ready, which is kind of to be expected at this time of day, but the accommodations for us were limited. There were no restaurants opened for us, so we waited in the lobby for the Beach Tree to open. And it was hot. I noticed other people going through similar experiences on other days of our stay.    Once our room was ready we were asked if we wanted a tour of the property. Our excellent host took us around and showed us everything, then introduced us to our room and handled our bags. Our experience with him was very good and we were ready to start our vacation.    To our delight, you had upgraded us to an ocean-front room near the King’s Pond. In celebration of our fifth anniversary, you also left a bottle of champagne for us. Your continued generosity with us over the years has solidified The Four Seasons for us as our go-to hotel for travel. The little things you do for us are very much appreciated and never taken for granted.    It is important to remember as you read this that we had an excellent experience overall. It was obvious throughout that the staff at the hotel was committed to us having a relaxing and enjoyable visit. A few standouts for us: Brent and Nicole at the Beach Tree restaurant, Doug, the Bartender at Ulu and Craig at the beach. We also had Steve for our server on our last night at Ulu and he was delightful. Those are the standouts, but again, it seemed like everyone was there for us. The pool and beach staff in particular.    I think when you stay at any hotel for more than a week you find little things that poke at you and that was the case with our visit. The adult pool lacks any shade during the heat of the day. And it was unseasonably hot during our stay. The way the chairs and umbrellas are set up makes it hard to dodge the sun in the afternoon. There are no cabanas here either. The bed things you have are dislocated from the pool area and seem odd. The primary location we are using for comparison here is Maui, where rentable spaces with shade are available at the adult pool and the chairs even have umbrellas that the staff will adjust for you as the day progresses.    But you have another pool that has better opportunities for shade. The only challenge with this pool is that there are no steps into the pool. One must slither off the edge, or climb up and down a ladder. Not all guests can do this. Or at least do it while remaining proud. This was probably our biggest disappointment with the facility. We were excited about this pool when we arrived, but ended up not spending any time there because of this detail.    We also felt the food was not of the quality we have received at the other two Four Seasons we have stayed at (Costa Rica once and Maui, numerous times), and local Four Seasons that we have dined at (Seattle). In fact some of it was downright poor. There were exceptions to this, of course. The NY steak, sushi, onion rings and ahi burgers were all excellent. But too many times we were let down by the food when it arrived. An example would be the lobster spaghetti, which sounds lovely on the menu, but arrives in a mucky state. The same night, my wife had the pappardelle with mushrooms and it was also average or below. Often times the cost of the food does not show up in the quality of the product.    For all the talk about being concerned about nature and the resort fitting into the landscape, we were disappointed with the lack of attention paid to the turtles when they were on the beach. It is quite obvious many hotel guests did not get the message the turtles should be left alone. Or, at the very least, given a wide berth. That is distressing to people who care about such things. We felt that a little more information about the turtles in room, or staff oversight on the beach from time to time wouldn’t require too much and might make a big difference.    We had an excellent couple’s spa treatment. Your soaking tub and both of our spa therapists were exceptional. We very much enjoyed that experience. Afterwards we talked about this and agreed that it was wonderful, with the exception of our locker room attendants. Although nice, they were both a bit rough. Mine was standing in front of the TV watching a loud NFL show when I came in to the relaxation room. He left and I muted the TV. It was back on when I left my treatment. Not really spa-like, but maybe that’s just me. The robes in the spa are all one size. In other words, the smallest guest and the largest guest are forced to wear the same size, rather than having a common area for the robes with different sizes available. This didn’t feel very spa-like either. Even in our room, there was a choice of two sizes of robes.    And finally, One of the oddest experiences happened to us. We were walking out with our binoculars to look at the Milky Way because we had noticed the clear sky on our way back from dinner. There was a couple of gentlemen with a huge telescope set up near the King’s Pond. We went over to them and I said in a jovial tone, “watcha lookin’ at?” One of them turned to me and said, “oh, we’re doing a private viewing for this couple over here,” pointing at the couple who were having dinner on the beach. “Oh, okay,” I said, and we turned to leave. Then the other guy, said, “it’s an eleven inch,” referring to the size of his telescope.    To someone that enjoys astronomy, and has never looked through an 11” telescope, that felt like a weird bit of taunting. Quite uncharacteristic for The Four Seasons.    As mentioned, The Four Seasons is definitely our go-to brand when traveling. We enjoy the consistency and professionalism of the staff and the obvious care that is taken to ensure that everyone’s visit is the best possible experience for them. This is so important and it is the detail that we talk to friends and fellow travelers about when we talk about The Four Seasons.

The walking path around the resort is lovely. We saw humpback whales off the coast. My mother and I were well tended to at the pool and we enjoyed the small treatments like cool towels, sunglasses cleaned for us, etc. The views from the room balconies overlooking the ocean are beautiful. Fantastic sunsets.    I would like to give this a higher rating but the food is not up to Four Seasons standards. The dining *experiences were fine with good service but the *food did not delight us. I sent back my main course at The Grill and the manager took it off the check. It was a beef dish, the chef's special that evening. It was so dry and tough that I'm certain the chef would not have eaten it. This was the only thing that was inedible but the other dishes were not impressive either. Food is an important part of a luxury vacation and we were disappointed in our meals. We didn't have a rental car or would have dined off property. For Four Seasons' prices, we expected better. Also, we had to guess where breakfast was served each morning during our stay as the location is changed. Is there a way to let guests know?

Some specifics this time we noticed:    1. While the Hualalai Grill, in our opinion, has not reached the heights of where it was under Alan Wong, it has upped its game remarkably in the past 2 years. I noticed some of the reviews noting the steaks were poorly prepared and we cannot comment on this since we always order fish. The kampachi (amberjack) I ordered was perfectly cooked and prepared with an outstanding combination of flavors.    2. This is the first time we visited during spring break. The resort was PACKED, and yet the service was still personal and attentive.    3. Breakfast is still the best on the planet. A stunning array of breakfast foods in an absolutely stunning location along the beach. It's always amazing when the staff remember you despite the thousands of guests they see. And, I think the continuity of the staff is a testament to the Four Seasons. We usually have never waited for a table, but with the resort so full, we did have to wait around 20' when we arrived at the peak time (9 am). They have coffee, water, tea available and brought doughnuts out for the kids while waiting. They managed the crush of people admirably and we never felt rushed or harried.

360995965,10,For seedy big businesses,"We recently returned from a visit to this property. We have been coming here for years. This year by far was the most expesnive and not ar all service oriented. First off, there is no longer an airport lounge or airport hospitality service. Check in was under staffed. We did nit see any of the am angers or front desk personnel we used to know. We knew this was a bad sign.  Our room had broken a/c, broken furniture, and cigarettes butts that lined the patio. We also saw numerous roaches sitting out there. The pool and beach lounges were also tattered or broken. Sure the landscape is pretty, but at over 1.000 a night, the property is really torn around the edges.  Pool and beach were really under staffed. We went hours without water refill, etc.  this is not at all a place for family vacation or relaxation. This resort caters now to big businesses (think of the pool as over crowded groups of people in their 20s and 30s who are really intoxicated). At night you can not only hear them and thief parities, but also smell their cigarettes all over.    The best part is how we spoke to the manager Cindy. Upon discussing room rates, she offered us a non-refundable rate. I said i was battling cancer so this might not be the offer for me. She laughed and said we could get trip insurance. I thought this was heartless and very unprofessional. This is also after many years of business and referrals to this resort. As i tell my friends, don't come here.

Of course the rooms are nice and well appointed, of course the property is beautiful, but it is the service that was just totally over the top. From check-in to check-out, the service at this hotel is beyond comparison. For example, we were in one of the restaurants the first night and our daughter was so tired that she was trying to curl up on her chair to sleep while my wife and I finished dinner. Within seconds of her laying down, not one, but two servers came over and said ""we can do way better than that"". They went and got her two larger chairs that she could stretch out between and found her a pillow so she could be comfortable while we ate. That was just the tip of the iceberg. The poolside concierge who comes over so you don't have to get up to make dinner reservations was also wonderful. Every person we came into contact with, without exception, was just great.

359574977,50,Simply Amazing!,"My husband and I had the pleasure of staying at the Four Seasons Hualalai for four nights. From the moment you enter through the front gate, you're treated like royalty. The front office team greeted us by name and offered us a complimentary mai tai as our room keys were made. Then the bellman escorted us to our room so we didn't wait one minute for our luggage. This level of service and attention to detail shined through out entire trip.    The two adult pools were lovely, this is definitely a relaxing environment and designed for couples or small groups. The poolside staff was awesome, they're constantly refilling your water glass, offering to clean your sunglasses, offering chilled towels & serving complimentary smoothie shooters. At the adult swim up bar we were served mini margarita's as one of the complimentary ""treats"" and completely amazed when Dakota Smith (one of the Four Seasons employee's) joined us in the pool with fresh rolled sushi (on a floating sushi boat) for our group to munch on.    Our guest room was beautiful and very spacious. We had a ground floor ocean front room and while the ground floor sacrifices a little bit of the ocean view, the private outdoor shower made it completely worth it. The housekeeping team impressed us everyday! They literally folded the clothes we had laying out and provided a turn down service with bedside water glasses every night.    We dined onsite for breakfast daily and one dinner at Ulu. We were very happy with our dinner at Ulu, we received great service and enjoyed all of the dishes we ordered. Our only negative feedback would be that the breakfast staff at Ulu was very unattentive, it took 10+ minutes each morning to be noticed. While the breakfast buffet at $40+ seems expensive, we ordered a la carte one morning and by the time you order juice, coffee and an entree, it actually ended up being more.    My husband golfed one day and thoroughly enjoyed the course. We did a morning activity of stand up paddle boarding and the staff was very helpful at getting us into the water and prepared for the activity (not offered complimentary as we've been accustomed to at other properties).

359413887,50,"Fantastic Resort, Exceptionally Pricey, but Worth It!","My husband and I have stayed at FS Hualalai 8 or 9 times in the past 15 years. It is by far the most expensive room we've ever paid for but we are absolutely in love with this resort! We returned from there less than a month ago and we are already planning our trip for next year. It is a beautiful and luxurious resort that I hate to leave every time I go there.    For couples who don't want to be around tons of families and children it is imperative that you time your visit very well. We made the mistake of going there during spring break one year a long time ago and it was quite miserable. Kids, kids, kids everywhere. Completely misbehaving and running around like maniacs and their wealthy parents doing nothing to correct it. After that experience we work closely with our travel agent and the resort reservation team to understand when the best time to travel would be. We've been super pleased with our timing ever since.    The grounds are absolutely beautiful from the moment you pass through the security gate and enter the extended property. The beaches are small and rocky, but we enjoy seeing the mix of light sand and black lava. If you are looking for a huge and swimmable beach, this is not the place for you.    We always stay in an upper level room in the King's Pond area because it is very quiet and offers a spectacular view. This area closes to guests at 4pm each day. We pay a top premium for the rooms closest to the ocean (literally 10 feet) and enjoy the view and noise of the waves. The rooms themselves might be considered basic but they are well-appointed and comfortable.    We enjoy the restaurants on property and rarely go elsewhere for breakfast and dinner: Ulu is their best place for dinner. Fantastic food and service. Beach Tree comes in second for both food and service. Hualalai Grill comes in at a distant third. It is far away from the beach and overlooks the golf course. With other options being right next to the ocean you need to have AWESOME food and service. Everything was just okay. Nothing bad, but just okay.    I read several other reviews here that spoke of having special surprise amenities delivered. I also read where several people mentioned their delight in being upgraded to suites for no apparent reason. These things have NEVER happened to us over our 15 years of visiting. That doesn't stop us from going back time and time again because it is a magical place.

Only complaint about dining was the steak house in the Golf Club, which was not up to standards (on Prime Rib night, they were out of all but well done by the time of our reservation at 7:00, and who eats prime rib well done???).

358437738,40,Beautiful Resort w/Fantastic Food & Beverage,"I'd like to start by saying if we could offer a 4.5 rating we would. Please allow me to explain;    I believe it's safe to say you expect nothing but impeccable service when you stay at a Four Seasons Resort, at least we do. With that being said we did have a couple hiccups however, I must admit the service recovery was quick and responsive. Because of the service recovery by Cindy (Manager), we would prefer to give a 4.5 but because of the hiccups, we don't believe we can offer the 5, simply because of our Four Seasons expectations. I hope that makes sense.    TIP: If you are a couple or single traveler, request a room near the farthest pool ""Palm Grove Pool"". it's truly an adults only pool and is meant for relaxing and is quiet. It has a swim up bar as well and you can order food. It also closes around 6/7pm, so the area is quite serene in the later evening. A great place to fall asleep with the waves crashing. Did we mention the swim up bar?!    Food & Beverage: NOTE: The restaurants close EARLY! Be prepared for early'ish dinners. Breakfast Daily at ""ULU Ocean Grill"" is fantastic! Your choice of the Buffet or A la carte. Our favorite ended up being the ""ACAI BOWL"" = HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! We ended up with that place in front of us daily, along with the breakfast wrap. The Smoothies were also a favorite of ours. We dined in all the restaurants, and enjoyed our experiences in each. Kona is a wonderful island, but when it comes to restaurant offerings, they're a bit slim. We found ourselves often returning the resort for dinners.    The Rooms: Well appointed with what you need. There are screen doors so that you can feel the ocean breeze without swallowing or swatting bugs inside the rooms. SIMPLE YET SMART! We have been to many resorts where bugs can play a factor when leaving doors open. We slept with the screens closed every night. We enjoyed our room at the Palm Grove Pool. Try to stay directly behind the pool to get an open view of the ocean.    Amenities: Book through AMEX Fine Hotels, you'll enjoy the perks. ALSO, a fun fact; There are washer and dryers, which the resort offers complimentary, located near the rooms. That was not something we were told but discovered with curiosity. They provide the soap, etc. What a saving grace and a great way to return home with clean clothes.    Fitness Center: Probably one of the best fitness centers at a resort I've ever been to! Several facilities and a lap pool. Fantastic and top quality.    Tennis Courts: We played daily. Great courts! NOTE: You can play night tennis upon request. However, be aware there is a cost to not showing for your court time. I could see there were making some minor repairs but the courts were fabulous!

358304319,40,Beautiful resort/ but overpriced,"We spent 8 nights at this beautiful resort. The grounds are impeccable and the staff friendly, professional and extremely attentive. The pool staff I think were the hardest working and most professional staff I have ever experienced in a resort of this caliber. The pool amenities( and that was the only time you were given anything for free) were consistent and fun. Sunglasses cleaned, sun lotion,fresh ice water constantly being served, iced eucalyptus towels, Popsicles, chocolate covered ice cream and frozen pineapple chunks daily. The pool attendants were very good at finding chairs and refreshing towels.  Now, the breakfast staff at the 2 restaurants that serve breakfast were not as on top of service as the pool. They ranged from very nice but allowing others to take our table to just plain rude and the breakfast service was slow and not once did we have our food served at the same time. Unacceptable for the prices. $21.00 for a bowl of steel cut oats, really ????  Dinner was better and more organized but the food was very good, not great!! The menu never varied once and even the specials were repeated. Again for the price I would have expected a little better.  The resort was spectacular and if you want to swim side by side with rock stars and celebrities this is the place to stay in Kona, but don't expect anything on your pillow at night ! No chocolate, macadamia nut, orchid or any of the native symbols to remind you of where you are. Hard to believe!! The check in, however was very special with a beautiful Lei and Mai Tai's. I would stay again but for 4-5 nights max. Not a lot to do on Big Island so do all your souvenir shopping on another island. The woman at the front desk suggested I go to Target in Kona to buy souvenirs. Of course the gift shop on the property was wonderful, but super high priced. Just like everything at this location. BUT after all it is the Four Seasons, so if you can afford to stay here then paying 24.00 for a martini and 19.00 for a Mai Tai poolside should not be a problem??? Right??

We arrived very early. Earlier than originally planned (930am) and when we got to the hotel we were greeted with open arms and our room was ready. !!!!!! We were upgraded to a superior oceanfront one bedroom suite. What a treat !!! Beautiful room. Bathrooms and a view I shall never forget .The hotel and staff are wonderful.

Another example - we left our camera in a taxi and the Four Seasons was able to get it back from the taxi driver and shipped it out to us next day at no cost to us (I offered to pay as it was our mistake). Amazing!    The resort itself is beautiful. I really just wanted to stay there and enjoy all the swimming and dining options however, we did force ourselves off location to enjoy the Big Island :) The only minor set backs are the pool with the swim up bar is a quiet pool - strange as you would think that would be a pool where talking was allowed (a few friends of ours had a staff member come over and politely remind them of the quite pool policy) . And the beach where the resort is situated is not swimable due to the lava rock - I didn't mind as there were beaches nearby and the views are still gorgeous.

We had very high expectations and were not disappointed in any area.    The resort is very close to the airport which made the journey quite simple. First recommendation would be to take a car service rather than renting a car. There is absolutely no reason to venture off property if you are there to relax and possibly play golf.    The resort is a number of two story buildings spread across the property with a large number ocean front. Recommendation number two would be to save money on ocean front in that we spent a limited time in the room. There are a number of pools on the grounds with a lot of lounge chairs for relaxing and sunbathing.    There really isn't a traditional sand beach on the property that might be a drawback for families with children. Recommendation number three, no beaches might actually mean less children! Not saying that lids are ""bad"", just nice to relax, read a book and sit by the pool without a lot of ""noise"".    We ate all of our meals on the property and enjoyed each and every experience. We especially enjoyed the Grille above the golf club. The steaks were prepared as requested while the salads (ceasar) were excellent.    Golf was fantastic. We played multiple times and really enjoyed the course. The signature 17th hole is to be savored, while the entire course was a really enjoyable.    Finally, the staff was fantastic.

354396613,50,AWESTRUCK.,"Unbelievable and over-the-top experience here at the Four Seasons...Wherever we were (pool, restaurants, bar, bocce - whatever), we never felt rushed. The property is extremely well-situated with views abound at every turn. The rooms were clean, comfortable and the extra service touches did not go unnoticed. They include, but were not limited to: glasses cleaning cloths, delivery surprises of chocolates, and strawberries, cool water at bedside turndown, and housekeeping even cleaning my dop kit!  With so much to do on the property, we never had the desire to leave - but we did......always looked forward to coming back at the end of a tour day....  A BIG SHOUT OUT to Nicole (Concierge from Las Vegas) for her dedication to our every need! Kathryn was an awesome greeter upon our arrival!

Lovely resort layout, beautiful views, well appointed rooms (we loved the steam shower), excellent fitness facilities.    Top highlight was the Ulu restaurant, not only for a great beachside breakfast, but one of the best dinner experiences I've had anywhere across the globe. The Grill over T the golf club was regrettably a disappointment by comparison - over priced, notably lower food quality. The Beach Tree was a lovely lunch environment with excelled food and service.    Our main disappointment was a mixup by the concierge in mis-scheduling a car to the airport. I was completely underwhelmed in the lack of accountability and while they did address the mistake within about 15 minutes, the stress of uncertainty and the faint apology were a negative surprise in an otherwise fabulous stay",Mar 2016,February 2016,Traveled with family,,"San Francisco, California"

Everyone is jumping to make you happy. My wife and I could not stop raving about this place since the moment we stepped foot in the lobby. The one thing I would caution is that everyone is asleep by 9:30. If you are looking for an after-dinner drink, you will likely be one of the only people on property doing so.

350554034,40,"Our favorite Hawaiian hotel, but don’t go during ski week","We spent 15 days at Hualalai in February. This being our 7th trip, we should have known better to book during ski week, but we were determined to go for two weeks in February. The first week was great - amazing staff, service and atmosphere. Overall this was a perfect week.    Our second week (ski week) was a completely different experience. ‘Ulu for breakfast was chaotic and stressful. Our daily server Jorge was great, and the new manager Christina was helpful in trying to find us ""quiet"" table each morning. However, our biggest complaint for the week was the lack of quiet/couple space in any of the restaurants (especially Beach Tree). Tables for two are always scattered around large tables with big families. At breakfast the children are not well behaved, and staff didn't do much to keep the children contained. The overly relaxed family atmosphere has become off putting for us. I don't know many city restaurants that would allow that kind of behavior. And of course the hostess staff always make you feel like you have the problem that you don’t want to sit next to a family with screaming children. We tried going later on several mornings and sometimes it worked, sometimes it completely backfired. We had room service breakfast for that last two mornings because we couldn't face the crowds.    We dined at beach tree for 12 out of 14 nights. The first week was perfect. Ricardo the new chef is great. He really made the trip for us. The food is excellent and the servers are always very professional and prompt. In the past they have always found a smaller area to put couples. However, during ski week all bets were off. Families rule this restaurant, and forget finding any peace and quiet. Oh, and Valentine’s Day was the complete opposite of romantic. It strikes me as confusing that they prioritize families who have children eating for free (under 5) over adults buying expensive champagne/wine and $50 entrees. But our saviors were the bar staff, who always made us feel welcome, and fortunately kids can't eat at the bar. But saying that, it’s kind of ridiculous to be spending $300 on a meal to be forced to sit at the bar.    In summary, we still love this hotel and are planning our return trip next year (avoiding ski week of course). Our message to management is that they need to consider couples in their hotel ""equation"". Couples spend money too. Try finding a section of the restaurants that allows tables for two only. Train hostess staff on seating people in a more considerate way. Just because you no longer hear the screaming children, doesn't mean that we can’t.",Feb 2016,February 2016,Traveled as a couple,,"Toronto, Ontario"

Other than an overrun breakfast buffet with a long wait for your omelet. Also, a great place for families. Not the best place for a romantic getaway. Even in the adult only Palm Grove area guests would park a baby carriage while they were at beach and would run back and forth to tend to the baby.Not a very good set up. They should have been asked to go to family area.Spa needs improving. We did both the Hualalai experience and the romance package. They used different staff member's so felt like just 3 services put together. Not very relaxing. The rooms are just average. We were in an Oceanfront room in Palm Grove.

349484224,40,Not all that it used to be,"We travel to the island quite frequently and have stayed at the FS several times over the years and also enjoy coming to the restaurants when staying elsewhere. Have noticed a marked uptick in the room rates, and at the same time, a decline in the ""little things"" that used to make the resort the most amazing place on earth. For example, we have always loved having a sunset dinner at Beach Tree restaurant and letting our little ones feel pampered with special treatment both before and during the meal - they used to provide chalk board mats (even letting us take them home because our kids loved them so much), cut veggies and dip, special kid-sized cutlery, kid-friendly tropical drinks, and special fun desserts, but over the last two years, we have noted that none of that is provided any longer - it's just a regular dinner with a kid menu, which is fine, but no longer as special as it used to be.  Also, and apparently due to ""fire code,"" when trying to plan our next trip for our family of 5 (3 young children all under the age of 9) we were told that we must split ourselves between two rooms and an adjoining room could not be guaranteed. Aside from the annoyance of the added cost of a second hotel room at more than $1,000 per night, because each room must have an adult (and we would not consider letting our young children stay alone anyway), this means that one adult would stay in one room with one child and the other adult would have to stay with the other two children - not very conducive to an amazing family vacation. We will be staying elsewhere on our next trip and likely any other trips with our children unless FS is able to guarantee two connecting rooms.  Finally, and as another reviewer mentioned, during one of our stays, the adult only Palm Grove pool was overrun with rather loud and rowdy 20-somethings who were clearly enjoying the swim-up bar a little too much. The staff, who was usually amazing during the rest of our trip, did nothing to calm the scene or recommend that the rowdy pool-goers move their party to one of the the bigger, louder general pools. This was upsetting to us and the rest of the couples who were there to relax in the quiet of an adult only atmosphere.  This all said, FS Hualalai is an amazing place. It is absolutely beautiful, the staff is friendly and (usually) attentive, the rooms are spacious and filled with every amenity possible, the food at every restaurant is incredible, and it really is a wonderful place to relax and escape.

The little coffee shop was great for a quick, light breakfast after hitting the gym, and we loved the options and prices at the resident's beach house for lunch and dinner.

347652899,50,Best resort in all of Hawai`i,"We had not stayed at the FS Hualalai for about 6-7 years, so it was nice to get back in January 2016. After a 12 day stay I am comfortable saying that this is still the best resort in all of Hawai`i. It is also obscenely expensive, but most of the time we felt we got good value for the experience. The rooms continue to be wonderful, with lots of space, great bathrooms with double sinks, separate tub and shower, and a private toilet. The newer pool at the Palm Grove crescent is a nice addition as an adult only pool with a swim up bar. It can attract a rowdier crowd who have taken too much advantage of that bar, but most of the time it is quiet place. With tax and tip 2 Mai Tai's were over $40, so it is expensive to over indulge.    The restaurants provided excellent service and food most of the time, but we did have rare lapses. Ulu was our favorite, and the sushi, catch of the day and other specials were usually the best choices. And you can't beat the soufflés for dessert. The steaks at the Hualalai Grill were outstanding. At the Beach Tree Restaurant, I would recommend sticking with the simpler dishes (pizza, burger, pasta, etc.) and avoid the other very expensive entrees. Breakfast buffet at Ulu was great and room service breakfast also very good. The ice cream at the Trading Post was delicious.    We played tennis nearly every day and found the service there to be excellent. We do not play golf. The snorkeling is the Kings Pond and the small protected area of ocean were actually pretty good. Saw a turtle every time in the ocean.    The spa continues to be one of the best I have seen. The coed outdoor garden area was nice to relax with my wife after a massage. Very good exercise equipment and lap pool to burn off the calories from all the soufflés.    We loved the free washing machines and driers that are very abundant around the resort.

It is a short drive from the airport at Kona so if you're looking for a place to unwind and enjoy the beauty of the big island--this is a winner. The facilities and oceanside location are great. When we arrived there was a problem with our reservation (no fault of four seasons) and a terrific gentleman (Joe) at the front desk sorted it out for us and made us feel great. In fact--it is people like him that make the Four Seasons such a benchmark for excellence--he was awesome and really took care of us. There is snorkeling, golfing, spa, beach, hiking, tennis and much more. Its also great if you just have a few days to sit by the pool. We had a great time. Try the ULU restaurant-it is fantastic! I can't say the service was as perfect as their Punta Mita location in Mexico---there were just occasional ""little things"" that we had to ask for…nothing serious, but when comparing excellence, I just have to say it was not as great as Punta Mita. It was great, but just not as good as Punta Mita. BUT--It was fantastic and I would go back in a heartbeat. Absolutely beautiful. I miss the sound of the ocean already.

344473188,40,Beautiful property but buildings too dense to feel exclusive,"This was our first stay at a Four Seasons Resort in the USA. The location is beautiful but the resort feels a bit commercial and crowded.    Rooms  All rooms in the resort are in 2 storey buildings attached to each other. The disadvantage of this is noise e.g. loud music in the middle of the night. This is not the fault of the hotel but if the hotel had regular security patrolling the property, it can be prevented. We also had one or two occasions with guests mistaking our room for theirs and attempting to open our door. The room is very spacious and if you want a good view of the ocean, you need to choose at least a partial ocean view.    Restaurants  We dined at Beach, Ulu and Steakhouse. We didn't stay at the resort during peak season, but it was impossible to book a table between the hours of 6.30pm - 8pm. I had to reserve all our restaurants on the first day we arrived. We were only able to book one night for 7.30pm and the other nights we had to eat at 8pm. This is fine it you are all adults but with young children, this is not good for a ""family"" resort. The food was alright but nothing really outstanding for the price you had to pay. The restaurants were always busy, so it's hard to imagine how a couple can have a romantic quiet dinner. The service was generally very good at all restaurants.    Beach/Pool  Most of the service was great. We spent most of our time on the beach and Kings Pond. The Sea Shell pool being the family pool is the busiest pool. King's Pond is only open from 10-4, but I saw one guest ignoring the rule and went swimming in King's Pond after it was closed.    Property  The property is what this hotel has going for it, with beautiful ocean front, marine life, and great jogging trail around the resort.    Laundry  The best thing about America is the free laundry!! There is a laundry on each block of building, with free detergent, so you don't have to pay for expensive laundry service. Granted, sometimes you find other guests' undergarments left in the washing machine ..    Guests Services  There were no reading materials in the room about any activities, either on site or off site. That wasn't very useful at all as it seems the hotel prefer you either call up Concierge or walk to the lobby to talk to Concierge. Just as well I booked my own helicopter tour before I arrived.    Transport  We had the hotel arrange a taxi to and from the airport for $37.    Internet  Free wifi all over the resort!    Overall, we had a great time but the experience was very different from Four Seasons Resorts or other resorts in Asia. For the same price, we could have had our own villa in Thailand, Maldives or Bora Bora. However, if anyone is looking for a place to stay (and don't mind paying US$2000 a night) in Kona, Big Island, I would definitely recommend it.",Feb 2016,January 2016,Traveled with family,"Kings Pond is quieter, Sea Shell is more busy facing the pool.",

Two small things: when we booked we had called the hotel to ask for a quiet room -- so how did two adults end up with a room right behind the children's pool? Also we were here when hotel was at capacity due to golf tournament. Real challenge to get reservations for dinner around 6:00 -- first evening of our stay, two of the restaurants were closed to private functions and we ended up with room service (not bad but not what we really wanted.) Remaining three nights we ended up at same restaurant as others were not available until after 8:00. Good restaurant but after three nights we wanted a change! And hard to get a bar drink around 5 - 6:00 when we wanted to watch the sunset -- outside bar area is small and packed to capacity and bar by pool had closed down. On the positive side, I guess that saved us some money!

All the staff make you feel at home and provide exceptional service at a very busy time.    Since our last stay the Four Seasons have taken over the running of The Grille and the Resident Beach Club restaurants. However they don't appear to have made any real changes to them yet. The Grille is the weakest of the restaurants at the resort. We only went there for one dinner and it was disappointing with bad service and flavorless food. Also hate the fact there is a TV in the dining room.    We loved the food at ULU and the location is spectacular. Beach Tree is also good, but we both felt that the changes over the last year were not all for the better and found the evening menu in particular a bit limited. They also have bumped the prices up at the Beach Tree quite considerably.    Enjoyed all the ample sports facilities and like the the new rules around access to the Quiet Pool.

340937722,40,"The property is beautiful, but so is most of the island","I didn't realize that I failed to post a review from my honeymoon stay until I was planning another vacation and checked here to see what folks were currently saying about the property. It was page after page of superlative reviews, so I thought I'd offer an alternative observation, which is dated since my stay was in Nov 2014. (I searched for a workaround to the ""when did you travel"" drop down menu, but no dice.)    As is clear from looking at pictures and reading other reviews, the property is beautiful. It's also fairly large and if your room is on the outer periphery, like ours was, you may feel quite removed. Maybe for some that's a good thing. For us, we felt rather invisible. When we engaged the staff they were nice, but we never saw them much outside of the restaurants. We certainly didn't feel like anyone went out of their way to see how we were enjoying our stay. Maybe that's because we had booked one of the less expensive rooms? Or it was during a quiet week of the fall season?    When hearing how some other guests were being treated with nightly gifts and whatnot, it did leave me the impression that we weren't getting the same level of hospitality. Fair enough, if that's what you get when you pay for a better suite, I understand. But I couldn't conceive of returning when the whole island is filled with beauty and we could enjoy it and ourselves just as much a mile or two further up or down the coast.    We had looked forward to using all parts of the fitness center, but we found the fitness pool was closed during the entirety of our stay. That was very disappointing. The other fitness facilities were nice. And since the resort is large it was easy to get in a good jog without having to go out into traffic. We had a couples massage, and while my husband enjoyed his, mine was very poor. I paid someone $200 just to rub moisturizer onto my skin. There was also a staff member offering foot or similar massages directly on the beach, but maybe only during brief hours. Whenever we saw her and though oh we'll ask for her services next, she usually left the beach entirely (and no on else seemed to come by and ask if we wanted anything).    Being on our honeymoon, we had hoped to have such a wonderful trip that we might make it our regular anniversary destination. We'll go elsewhere next time, and for the money have room closer to the waterfront and maybe a bit more hospitality.",Jan 2016,February 2015,Traveled as a couple,,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania"
340764564,50,What a paradise resort in Hawaii,"This was my second time at FS Hualalai where I spend the first week of 2016; on arrival I was met by Joe and Diego Angarita, Director of Rooms who informed me of a nice and unexpected upgrade to a suite with oceanfront views.    The resort has many pools, my favorite being Beach Tree with fantastic poolside service and King’s Pond, a mixture of seawater and fresh water where one swims with over 4,000 fish, an eagle ray right at the resort! At this time of the year there were many green turtles resting on the sand or swimming in the beach.    They have a huge golf course which I didn’t use; but the resort has incredible paths for running alongside the ocean.    The food is 5 stars; Ulu restaurant for daily breakfast and for most of my dinners, terrific scenery (the waves break a couple of meters from your table) and the service the best in Hawaii: Cora the morning hostess has been for 19 years here so has Daniel at the grill who prepares the most delicious omelettes. Great service from Maggie, Fernanda and Regina: after one day they know your name and preferences.    Beach Tree restaurant next to the pool is more casual and very nice but with few fish on the menu; I prefer ULU. The Hualalai Grill is also an excellent alternative.    The resort is huge and even full it didn’t fell like it; the rooms are very comfortable and my suite (room 3111) was in the palm Grove section and had views of the ocean and the ponds surrounding the adults pool.

The one minor criticism I do have, which did leave a sour taste in our mouths was the breakfast buffet. There was only one restaurant where you could eat breakfast and I believe they charged something like 40 dollars for the food. Even if you don't go for the buffet and go for toast its still in the 10 dollar region. It is way too pricey for what you get and I think Four seasons should look at rectifying this.

338619584,50,Fantastic trip for our 25th anniversary,"We are finishing up our last night of an 8 night trip to the FS Hualalai to celebrate our 25th anniversary. It has been a great trip and we have thoroughly enjoyed every bit of it. We did not get here until January 1 so I believe we missed a lot of the crowds that many are complaining about on here.    This is our first visit to this resort and our first trip to a FS anywhere. We were told to come here by our next door neighbors who come to this resort almost every year. We are very thankful that they referred us here. The resort is beautiful and a fantastic place to relax, but the customer service is what sets it apart. I am stunned to read negative reviews on here about customer service problems but I know from the past that everyone has different expectations and experiences at these high end resorts. I can only say that ours has been overwhelmingly positive.    First, a few negatives. This place is utterly, jaw-droppingly expensive. We were splurging for a suite, so I knew going in that it would be pricey, but even once you get here the food is expensive. From a service standpoint, you get what you pay for here, but still, it ain't cheap.  Another negative was at the spa. We booked a couples massage and found that the couples massage rooms were outside in this beautiful setting that happened to be near the basketball court where some kids were playing during our massage. They apologized profusely, but it was not ideal to say the least.  Sometimes the customer service is too good, We constantly felt like there was someone knocking at the door to our suite, either bringing us something or taking it away or time for the room to be cleaned or time for turn down service. Can be a bit intrusive at times.  The wifi is free and you can access it all over the resort. However, we had a few times where it was very slow and hard to access. A minor quibble. At least we weren't asked to pay for it daily.    Now the good:  We were met at the airport in a limo and brought straight to the resort which is only about 10 minutes from the airport. VIP treatment on arrival and they quickly got us to our room. Check in was a breeze. We were supposed to be in a oceanfront room for three days and then a suite for the last five. It turned out that they were able to move us to the suite after the first night. Of course we had to pay the difference but the suite was great.    The resort is a beautiful creation. This part of the island is desolate and surrounded by lava. They have managed to create many resorts in this area out of that lava and FS Hualalai is the prettiest of the bunch. Two story huts placed close to the beach with a very natural setting makes it seem as if the resort has been here forever, I had not had any desire to come to the BIg Island before because I thought it was ugly and the beaches were not pretty but I was wrong. It is a lovely and very diverse island and there is a multitude of things to do.    The resort specializes in relaxation. One of the people I talked to on the phone prior to our stay said: ""WE do nothing better than anyone in the world"". Meaning, if you want to just come relax and unwind from the pressures of the world, this is the place. After a week here, we agree.    Our suite was great. A large sitting room with sofa and chairs and a large TV and a bathroom off the sitting room. Then a large bedroom with a larger TV and huge bathroom with an indoor walkin shower and also an outdoor shower cut out of lava rock. Outdoor shower is totally private. Outside the suite, we had a small plunge pool which was warmer than the other pools at the resort, a lanai with chairs and a table as well as an outdoor sofa. And then in front of our suite was a grassy area before the sand. THe grassy area had more loungers to relax on. You could really spend the entire vacation in and around the room.    As mentioned above, the spa was good but not spectacular. The restaurants were good but not spectacular given the prices. The exception was the Hualalai Grille overlooking the golf course. Our meal there was fantastic. The other exception was the Chef's Table that we had at Ulu. It was a special dinner for just the two of us with one of the resort's head chefs. He took us through a seven course meal complete with wine pairings and cooked right in front of us. It was a culinary experience that we won't ever forget. Overall I would say the restaurant experience is better than average but not great especially given the prices. It could be better.    The most spectacular part of this resort is its people. All of the staff that we came in contact with were unfailingly polite, charming and went out of their way to make sure we had a good time.The people here wait on you hand and foot and anticipate your every need. The pool stewards are awesome and even bring by little treats throughout the day like vodka Popsicles and frozen pineapple and other treats. You feel like royalty here.    The fact that we were in a suite meant that we were assigned a concierge before we came. Stephanie was our concierge and she went way above and beyond to make this trip special for us. I was in contact with her for 2 months leading up to the trip and she helped plan every detail. But once we got here, she made sure everything went perfectly. We changed several things about our plans and she took care of all the changes without any problems. She also sent us little gifts each day. She arranged a wonderful helicopter tour for us and knew the pilot we flew with. By the time we returned to our suite after the helicopter trip, she had framed pictures of my wife and I on the trip by the waterfalls that we saw. She must've had the pilot send the pictures to her but still, to think of doing that was unbelievable and something I will never forget. Stephanie was the very best part of the best part of this resort: its people.These employees like working here and it shows. Everyone works together to make the guests feel like they are the only ones around for them to wait on.    So basically, it was a wonderful way to celebrate 25 years together in a beautiful setting with great service, where they specialize in major league relaxation. We will miss the people and the great time we had and we will be wanting to come back and enjoy some more of the FS Hualalai brand of aloha very soon.

338509015,20,"Beautiful Setting, Terrible Value","We stayed at Four Seasons Hualalai for the first time over Christmas 2015/New Year's 2016. We had heard wonderful things about the resort from several people who have been going there for years. Their prices are exorbitant given the room quality, but given all the accolades, we were excited and hopeful that this would be the first of many visits there.    The pros:  *The island is ruggedly beautiful and the resort property is stunning    *Most of the non-managerial staff are professional, warm, and really good at their jobs    *The onsite cultural center has fun classes for children and adults    *Lots of fun activities for children    *Gorgeous pools    *Had a spectacular private anniversary dinner on the beach. Worth every penny, though they misspelled our last name on the personalized menu, so not quite one for the scrapbook.    The cons:  *Ridiculously overpriced - we've stayed at premier hotels throughout the world and this was so wildly expensive given what you get that we decided on day 1 we would never return    *Pool wait staff very hit or miss. It often took over half an hour - sometimes much longer - for someone to say hello or bring a glass of water.    *Ulu and Hualalai Grille were good, but Beachtree was beyond awful. Mediocre food, terrible wait times, ridiculously expensive for what was basically an Applebee's level meal. Maybe that's an insult to Applebee's, though. One day they served our daughter a chicken sandwich that hadn't been properly prepared and she bit into a huge piece of bloody cartilage. The Assistant Guest Services Manager was standing there when it happened and he was really apologetic and handled it well, but our daughter almost vomited and it ruined lunch entirely. The pool staff's response was to only remove her sandwich from the bill. A few hours (!!!) later a service manager came and apologized, but it felt perfunctory and he never even bothered to take off his sunglasses while he spoke to us.    *They nickel and dime you for everything, and their big events are overpriced to the point of absurdity. Their New Year's Eve Dinner was $375 per person for a buffet dinner which was good but not great, and then they tacked on an 18% mandatory gratuity, so the total was almost $1000 for two people. For a buffet and a glass of wine. The kicker is that the after-party near the beach was not included with the dinner, and we almost couldn't even get a seat. They had cordoned off the best seats for the VIPs and we were lucky to get a seat in the back. My husband, who is mild mannered and never complains, was livid. I understand that they need to make money, but you can go to other premier hotels/resorts and they make a profit while you feel like a valued guest, not like they're pickpockets and you're their mark. The Four Seasons Hualalai is like a gilded pickpocket.    * Speaking of gilded, I dropped an earring in our suite and discovered that the floor underneath all the area rugs is covered in plywood. They only put the beautiful tile in the places that showed. We told our friends about it. They checked and found their rooms were the same.    *The concierge team was weak. They forgot to book transportation for our fishing trip - which, by the way, was a waste of $800, because the fisherman said winter is a bad time to fish. Funny that the FS never mentioned that in their festive brochure. They also double-charged for our airport transportation, which they corrected when I noticed it. The worst thing was that a senior manager goofed and left a note and stuffed animal for our 8 year old daughter on Christmas Eve wishing her fun on her helicopter tour the next day. Except that we hadn't booked a helicopter tour, and then had to explain to our daughter, when she squealed with delight about a Christmas helicopter ride, that it was a mistake. I called the concierge to let them know about this, primarily so that they could route an animal and note to the correct child, and the concierge never really understood what the problem was. She finally said, ""Well, your daughter can keep the stuffed animal."" Wow. Thanks for not making me take away the stuffed animal after having had the ""Fooled you! No helicopter ride!"" conversation.    *We were confused several times with other guests who have the same last name. Not a huge issue, except this happened a lot. We received two phone messages for them as well.    *The laundry facilities were beyond gross. Moldy, mildewy, awful smell, had to ask for laundry soap. Could understand if we were staying in a bargain hotel, but not Four Seasons.    We love Hawaii and decided to return next year, just not to Four Seasons Hualalai. We will be renting a house with beachfront access and a private pool and spa, sleeping 8, for 25% (that's not a typo) of the cost of our two bedroom suite at the Four Seasons Hualalai. We will also have a full kitchen and so won't be held hostage to things like $33 10"" pizzas, $39 breakfast buffets, and $15 pots of coffee.    I touched base with our friends who have been going there for years and they said it is going downhill fast. I wish we'd gone in its heyday, because I feel like we wasted our money on this trip, but at least now we know.    As we were leaving, they asked if we would be returning next year and it was hard to keep a straight face. Thanks, but no thanks.    Incidentally, this is the first travel review I've ever written. We've stayed in many nice places without anything truly negative ever happening. Congratulations, Four Seasons Hualalai.

337987569,20,No Longer Our Home,"PREFACE: Unlike other reviews that may compare this property to other places, I am writing this review in relationship to our former stays at this resort. By this, I mean we have been coming her for years, taking our usual 2 connecting ocean view rooms and sometimes a suite.    We started coming here because the service was out of this world amazing. Before our needs were met (I didn't even know that I needed my sunglasses cleaned, my towels freshened, new water, etc). I didn't feel nickel and dime with resort fees, cabana rentals, etc. The rooms were immaculate. We would return every year seeing the same managers. We had airport meet and greets with a private lounge at the airport itself. The cocktail receptions were truly devine. It was truly our second home after coming here all these years. It was just the most special heavenly place on the planet (and we travel a lot).    1.) Last time, was a totally different situation. We paid the most we ever paid, so we decided to pay for the golf ocean. Way back they would go for 500-600 a night. Now they are up to 800. We check in for our two connecting rooms. After sitting in the lobby for about 40 minutes twiddling our thumbs (you would think if they met and greeted us at the airport they would have anticipated our arrival), we finally met with a man who hurried us through the process. He is about to send us off to our rooms when I ask, ""are our rooms connecting?"" He retorted no. Mind you, we called several times to reconfirm this. We ask for the front desk manager. Mind you, for years, Raphael was in charge of the desk. He was a hospitality GENIUS. We expected to see him, but instead, we found a new manager (probably why our rooms were given away). He offers us an upgrade to have connecting rooms after already having spent about half our stay in rooms far apart. Moving rooms on a trip for relaxation is not pleasant.    2.) My wife and son get to their room after a first day at the pool and beach. Mind you, we all sat the pool where there was only one pool attendant. No waters got refilled, no sunglass cleanings, no nothing. They get back to find a HUGE anthill in front of their entrance and are locked out of their room. You think after a horrendous check in, security would rush to let them in their room? No. Maybe they wanted 20 minutes. But, he you are dripping and sunburnt, that can seem like hours.    3.) More days go by. Long waits at the breakfast buffet. One day, no one showed up to give towels at the beach. The other days, only 1-2 pool staff members were at each pool. One employee, told us that they were understaffed. To be paying the most we have ever paid to find pools and beach understaffed is absolutely unacceptable.    4.) Our last night there, we have dinner at beach tree. A flying roach lands on my son's dinner plate.    5.) We depart to Kona airport after checking out. We expect the lounge at the airport along with our usual airport escort (previously we had a Four Seasons attendant) who walked us through security, took our luggage for us, etc at the airport.    In summary, our trip began and ended on a sour note. This place is not what it once was and I am really sad about it. I hope that this place goes back to old habits and emphasizes hospitality instead of making big profits (especially when seeing how employees work multiple jobs and still can't afford to live in a place with garbage pick ups). We were thinking about giving them another chance because we love the environment. Still feel like we have a cold shoulder from them.",Jan 2016,October 2015,Traveled with family,,los angeles

337732751,40,"Pampered Paradise, But Not Perfect","A friend and I recently took a week-long trip to the big island of Hawaii and stayed at the Four Seasons Hualalai, which was highly recommended both online and off. Overall the trip was highly enjoyable, but there were some definite hiccups which I'll detail below.    WEATHER  We took this trip the third week of December as a pre holiday relaxer. The weather was in the low to mid 80s, balmy but not overly humid and overall, very comfortable. Nights were breezy and warm. We often dined outdoors and did not need jackets of any sort.    MOSQUITOS  Despite many warnings about the Dengue outbreak, we did not encounter many mosquitos at all. For one, the FSH is located right on the water so it's breezy and the air is always moving. Mosquitos like more stagnant water. Also, we were told the FSH had been inspected and sprayed as a precaution. My friend, who is a mosquito target only suffered one small bite and we're not even sure it came from a mosquito.    SERVICE  Overall, service is excellent. The staff is friendly and courteous and go out of their way to remember your name and your general preferences (for instance, what kind of juice you like with breakfast or where you like to sit for dinner).    One glitch we encountered in the service area, had to do with a special turn down service which we were supposed to get as part of the ""Romance Package"" that we booked--in short, it never happened. I'm not sure when it was supposed to happen or what exactly it entailed, but we were disappointed that, by the last night of our 5 night stay, we never received it. Maybe next time, if there is a next time.    The second disappointment we encountered in relation to service had to do with the concierge. We'd planned on taking hiking excursions and excursions to nearby beaches--get out and explore a little. The concierge we dealt with pointed out several areas to hike but was not enthusiastic about her recommendations because she said many of the best hiking places were ""very far"" and, being sensitive to the mosquito situation, said we may ""prefer to stay local"" and try some of the excursions we could do right at the FSH kayaking, snorkeling etc) so as not to risk getting dengue. Fair enough, I guess, but she didn't really work with us to figure out a solution for two people who really wanted to go for a hike. Regarding our inquiry about the best beaches, we were told about Makalawena beach (""the most beautiful, picturesque beach!"") but then warned that it was VERY difficult to get to--we would need 4 wheel drive to get there and the resort was not keen on renting out 4wd vehicles to guests intending on driving over lava beds to get to a beach. We asked about hiring a driver but said nobody really offered those services. We asked about alternate routes to the beach and were told we could do a 1 hour kayak to the beach or walk 45 min in the hot sun... Ultimately, we ended up not going to Makalawena beach because the concierge made it sound so arduous... but on the way to the airport, our Taxi driver said that it was not THAT difficult to get to and that he and his pregnant wife recently made the walking trek with no problem. Me and my friend were really upset we went all the way to HI and didn't at least try to get to this supposedly awesome beach or go for a hike in the Waipio valley.    When we asked about something fun and cultural to do, the concierge recommended a Luau. The Luau we went to (at another hotel about 35 min away) left a lot to be desired. The food was decent, but there were only about 5-6 dancers and the attendance was very low, making the whole experience feel low energy and sad. It was definitely NOT worth the $150 per person price we were charged.    OTHER EXCURSIONS  There were a couple excursions we did that we really liked. 1. We did a coffee tasting and took a tour of Hula Daddy Coffee plantation which is about a 15-20 min drive up in the hills from FSH. The staff is fun and very well informed about all the stages of coffee growing, harvesting, roasting, brewing etc. You can also buy 100% Kona coffee and tea here. Really good coffee. 2. We wen the The Poke Shack, a hole in the wall spot to get poke, a local delicacy consisting of fresh tuna, mixed with various other ingredients served with rice. Really good, especially if you're a fan of raw fish or sushi.    SPA  The spa and work out facilities are clean, well kept and up to date equipment-wise. There are tennis courts and a half basketball court as well as a small rock climbing wall as well.    There was one glitch we experienced at the spa. My friend and I both got massages after our workouts. I got a Lomi Lomi massage, which I highly recommend - it's similar to a deep tissue massage but not quite as painful or as intense as some DT massages because the masseur uses more even pressure as well as his or her full hands and elbows/arms (as opposed to thumbs, which are often used in DT). My masseur spent plenty of time on my shoulders/neck/head area which was pure bliss and even wrapped a hot towel around my neck at the end. The glitch we had relates more to my friend's massage--or lack thereof. She opted for the Hot Stone massage which was recommended by two front desk attendants at the spa. They explained what the massage entailed and we read the description in the menu which seemed to match what the girls told us. My friend said that the placement of the stones all over her body was very tranquil and relaxing, but right when she was getting ready to really get massaged and get her knots worked out, her masseur rang a chime, signaling the end of her massage. She was disappointed that she was still pretty sore and that very little had been done in the way of actual kneading, massaging and thought maybe it was our fault for misunderstanding what the massage was supposed to be. We went back and reread the description in the spa booklet and the description did not really match the non-massage that my friend received. Conclusion? The Hot Stone massage (the version my friend got) was not worth the $280 + taxes and tips that we were charged, but the Lomi Lomi massage -- worth every penny haha.    THE FOOD  The food we had at all three of the on property restaurants on property was tasty and well prepared. It did lean towards being a little overpriced, but I guess that's to be expected. Our favorite spot was Beach Tree which is right off the beach. They offered more Italian inspired dishes and there was a live local musical act performing Hawaiian inspired music every night as you ate which was nice.    THE POOLS  The pools at the FSH are beautiful, clean and well attended. There is a Family pool (where kids can swim and splash and play), a Quiet pool (our favorite) which has lounge chairs as well as cabanas, an Adult pool, King's Pond (a large salt water pond with several dozens species of fish where guests can rent snorkeling equipment and actually snorkel) and a lap pool which is situated near the gym/spa area.    All in all, the FSH is a beautiful, tranquil, friendly place to relax and enjoy yourself. The more adventurous guests seeking beach/hiking excursions may want to do a little more research before heading over to figure out which beaches and hiking spots they may want to target and also figure out the best ways to get there because we ran into some issues in this area and really regret going all that way and not getting the full experience we initially sought out. Still we had a great time and would recommend this property.",Jan 2016,December 2015,Traveled as a couple,,"New York City, New York"

329747288,30,thanksgiving break with family-disappointing,the Four Seasons management of their beautiful pool and setting on the beach at hualalai needs rethinking. At these prices to have to compete for a chair at the one pool where they allow children is disgraceful. I understand that there are people who do not want to be bothered by children at a pool. But to have two beautiful pools 50% or less used and have one pool so crowded you could barely walk around is not good planning. Thanksgiving is about family and that is what was there-for the holidays they should give one more pool area over to families. To arrive at the pool with a toddler and have to get on a wait list is ludicrous. to have to wake up and run down to get a chair by 8 before they were all gone is also ridiculous. This brought tension to what should have been a restful vacation. Families take vacations on school breaks and the 4 seasons should adjust accordingly. my advice is don't go over a holiday with children or take an alarm clock and plan to be at the pool by 730.,Nov 2015,November 2015,Traveled with family,,"San Francisco, California"

We were there for 5 nights & ate all meals but one here - a sign of a true destination property & every single thing we all put in our mouths was incredibly well prepared & delicious. My son has a serious food allergy & every single server double checked & reported back to us, which we appreciated. We talked to many staff here & what struck me was how many locals went away to university & came back to work in any capacity here - they enjoyed it so much! One example, Kelsey, one of our beach attendant assistants, took the trouble of bringing me multiple little jars of the hotel's aloe vera cream, after I commented how much I liked it. The Thanksgiving dinner at Ulu was by far the best buffet we have ever had. I was a pig eating 5 small lobster tails - so delicious! Staying here is a truly relaxing experience.There is nothing nicer than eating breakfast a few feet from the waves, or being served a delicious bento box on a beach chair!

328101465,50,An embarrassment of riches!,"We ended our visit to the Big Island on a very high note by staying at the Four Seasons Hualalai for a couple of nights. The beauty of the resort property and high level of client service surpass even “normal” Four Season standards. The resort also offered a number of unique experiences on-site which contributed to some wonderful memories of our trip! For example:  • Lounging at a private cabana (first come, first served) at King’s Pond  • Snorkeling with the resident tropical fish; feeding the resident eagle ray  • Taking a Hawaiian language class at the onsite Cultural Center (so I could correctly pronounce the places I had visited to my friends and family back home!)  We stayed in a one-bedroom superior suite with views of King’s Pond and the ocean. Anything I write would not do the room justice – just trust that the superior suites are AH-MAZING! The location is ideal if you want a quiet room since King’s Pond is only open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.  Other things that may not be “huge factors” but things we positively commented on throughout our trip: Delicious hamburgers and onion rings on the room service menu! They would easily rival any specialty burger restaurant in NYC. And we really appreciated the practical aspect of having access to free, on-site washers and dryers!

327528871,40,"Beautiful property, not as kid friendly as we expected","We stayed at Four Seasons Hualalai for a week in November. Having stayed at the Four Seasons in Maui twice before (once with our twin babies- now toddlers), I will do a comparison for those readers who are debating between the two. If you are travelling with kids- I would not recommend Hualalai. Given that Maui was so kid friendly, we expected the same at Hualalai but we received a lot of dirty looks (and comments) from other guests, especially at Ulu restaurant. We ended up dining in our room most nights or avoided dinner rush. Hualalai has a wonderful shallow (1.5 ft) toddler pool with sand bottom/ beach which is great but wasn't somewhere we wanted to spend the whole day, and the beach is not really meant for kids (unsafe with rocks, small in size, plus adult chairs overlooking). There were activities for older kids at Kids for all Seasons but the kids there didn't look like they were having the time of their lives and were either by themselves or with nannies). Could have been the time of year though since it's meant for school aged children. If you are not travelling with kids, I would choose Hualalai if you are looking for a quiet, romantic setting. That being said, food quality was not near what we expected for Four Seasons and if you are a beach person, Maui is probably more your cup of tea. Prior to staying at Hualalai, we spent a week in a rental property where we had access to Mauna Kea resort, and that was a great beach if you want to do a quick day trip from Hualalai though to get your beach fix. If you do decide to go to Hualalai, room tip: 1101 is great if you have small children as its in close proximity to Sea Shell pool, Ulu restaurant for breakfast, grassy area out front for kids to run and play. Also, being on the first floor and near the path you have easy access for stroller plus all ground floor rooms have a lovely outdoor shower with lava rock wall.",Nov 2015,November 2015,Traveled with family,,"Edmonton, Canada"

I looked forward to going to sleep every night just to have breakfast on the beach the next morning - enjoying french press Kona coffee, fresh tropical juice, and ridiculously good bacon! We tried every restaurant on the resort grounds for dinner, and they were all equally great. We never had a bad meal.  The next best part of the day would have to be enjoying the outdoor shower in our ground floor room. There's nothing else like it in any other resort I've stayed at. It was amazing.  The service is second to none. Every staff member was helpful, pleasant, and everyone knows your name. The concierge was extremely helpful in booking us a rental car for a day and suggesting destinations and printing up all of the directions for us.  I really can't say enough good things about this resort.

327039211,50,"The service was, by far, one of the best we have ever experienced!","I don't give out 5 stars often, so this really means something! We stayed at the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai at Historic Ka'upulehu this fall for my niece's wedding. We stayed at the Four Seasons for a full week and did our best to experience all that the resort had to offer.    First, our room...we had a second floor room that overlooked the Beach Tree pool with excellent views of the ocean and the sunset. While our balcony overlooked the pool, it was set back enough that we did not have any noise from the pool at all. We stayed in a superior suite, and our room really was just like what you see on the website. Second floor rooms do not have the outside shower. Some reviewers say the rooms are tired and outdated, which is a bit true with some nicks and bruises on the furniture and walls. The decor is traditional Hawaiian with dark woods. It was comfortable and clean. The outdoor furniture on our balcony was a bit tired, as well, but, the sunset and the warm breezes made up for it.    Pools-We spent time in each pool, as well as the ocean and enjoyed each one. The King's Pond is a great place to help little ones learn how to snorkel. Our favorite pool was probably the Beach Tree, as it was quiet and a great place to hang out and read all day.    Restaurants-We ate at most, but not all, of the restaurants. The food was good at each one, but it was extremely expensive, especially once you add a cocktail or two to the order. Seems that if you are spending crazy amounts of money to stay at the resort, the food shouldn't be another arm and a leg...We opted to go to the grocery store and buy some breakfast items to keep in our mini frig instead of spending almost $100 each morning for the breakfast buffet.    Property-The property is absolutely beautiful and very well maintained. We walked, each morning and evening, along the beachfront path. A few times we were able to see sea turtles on the beach. The resort is very close to the ocean. The beach is small, but very adequate for laying on a hammock or recliner and napping to the sounds of the ocean. The swimming area is ""rocked"" off so that the waves break before they get into the area. The water is amazingly warm and clear!    Spa-I did a nice little spa day with a massage and a pedicure. The massage was wonderful and the manicure lasted for weeks after we returned home. The spa gardens are beautiful and peaceful.    Wedding-My niece's wedding was a dream, even though we had to last minute move it indoors because of rain.    So, I saved the best for last...the service-From the second we pulled up to the front of the hotel, the service was absolutely phenomenal! Seriously, EVERY person we interacted with that worked at the resort was so completely, comfortably nice and helpful. Nothing stuffy, just sincere niceness! From the sweet woman who did our room each day, to the wonderful poolside servers who remembered our names (and our drink orders) each day, each and every person was wonderful. Example-my husband jumped in the pool one morning and forgot that his phone was in his pocket. One of the poolside servers immediately ran to get him a bag of rice so that we could try to save the phone (the rice trick did not work, unfortunately). Example 2-on one of our last days, there was a power issue and the power was out for almost half of the day. The pool servers continued to serve us and brought out complimentary food and drinks while we were by the pool.    It was the consistent, excellent service that made our stay truly 5 star, and it will be the main reason we will return!",Nov 2015,September 2015,Traveled with family,,"Hinsdale, Illinois"

For our wedding anniversary celebratory golf cruise through the Hawaii islands we wanted to play Hawaii’s top ten golf courses.    Our GolfAhoy agent booked us a Penthouse Suite on the 7 Day NCL ‘Pride of America’ liner which cruises roundtrip through the islands from Honolulu every Saturday.    We studied the championship courses that are included in the GolfAhoy 10 Day VIP package but choose instead a combinable pre-cruise and a post-cruise customized trip that GolfAhoy organized flawlessly for us - to our Top 10 Hawaii Golf Course bucket list which we copied from a FoxNews report, starting with #1, the Club at Hokulia.    Club at Hokulia  81-6636 Pu'u Ohau Place  Kealakekua, HI 96750  On the stunning Kona Coast near the beach town of Kailua-Kona sits the Club at Hokulia. Opened in 2002, the exclusive Hokulia is the only private ocean-side golf club on the Big Island. The Jack Nicklaus Signature Golf Course spans three miles and 1,550 acres of prime Hawaii real estate with panoramic ocean views. Nicklaus designed the par 72 course to be challenging, featuring frequent hazards and difficult greens. But despite the expertise needed to conquer the course, you can bask in the balmy ocean breeze, enjoy the scenery and relax as you consider club choices. The weather is superb year-round, with no strong winds and temperatures hovering in the 70s and 80s.  Click here for more information on the Club at Hokulia.    Hualalai Golf Course  Four Seasons Resort Hualalai at Historic Kaupulehu  100 Kaupulehu Dr.  Kailua-Kona, HI 96740  The Hualalai Resort is home to two courses, but the Nicklaus Signature Design is the one you want. The eighteen-hole course, which hosts the annual Mitsubishi Electric Championship at Hualalai, was the first on the island to be designed by golf legend Jack Nicklaus. Signature hole 17 will remind you of why you picked up golf in first place, and a nighttime round of glow-in-the dark ""scramble"" will bring out the kid in you. The 7,100-yard course offers three pupu and drinks stations to ensure a lively game. Wrap up with Hawaiian favorites like Huli Huli chicken at Hualalai Grille, located above the eighteenth green and boasting breathtaking views of the course and ocean. Hualalai is open to players staying at the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai at Historic Kaupulehu, as well as club members and their guests.

Mauna Kea Golf Course  Mauna Kea Beach Hotel  62-100 Mauna Kea Beach Drive  Kohala Coast, Hawaii 96743  If you want a classic take on Hawaiian paradise, book your tee time at the Mauna Kea course at Mauna Kea Beach Hotel on the Kohala Coast. Designed by Robert Trent Jones, Sr., Mauna Kea Golf Course opened in 1964 and was christened by the ""Big Three,"" Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player. Nearly five decades later, it remains the gold standard by which other island courses are judged. The course was renovated in 2008 by Jones' son Rees who oversaw the planting of highly efficient TifEagle and 419 Bermuda grasses, as well as the additions of state-of-the-art irrigation and drainage systems. The challenging par-72 course spans 7,370 yards with elevation ranges from zero to 300 feet above sea-level. After making your birdie on the eighteenth hole, the attentive staff will clean your clubs and offer you a cold mango-scented towel.

North Course at Mauna Lani Resort  Mauna Lani Bay Hotel and Bungalows  68-1310 Mauna Lani Dr.  Kohala Coast, HI 96743  Located on the Kohala Coast of the Big Island, the North Course at the Mauna Lani Resort is truly a one-of-a-kind experience. Built on a lava bed, the sprawling 6,913-yard course offers a unique setting in which to tee off. The rolling terrain, dotted with mesquite forests and herds of wild goats, is breathtaking. Opened in 1981, the par-72 course distinguishes itself from its sister South Course by its location further inland and its calmer winds. The unique seventeenth hole is a charming par 3 encased in a lava coliseum. After eighteen holes, relax with an après-golf snack of guacamole or fish tacos at Huli Sue's.

Prince Golf Course at Princeville  The St. Regis Princeville Resort  5-3900 Kuhio Hwy.,  Princeville, HI 96722  If you're up to the challenge, the Prince Golf Course at The St. Regis Princeville Resort will test your talent. The recently renovated par 72 course, named after the Hawaiian Prince Albert Kamehameha, was designed by Robert Trent Jones, Jr. with five sets of golf tees for various levels of ability. The black tees are the most difficult and reserved for players with a handicap of five or less. Even if you're not yet up to par, you can play the red (novice) tees and soak up the incredible views of the north Kauai mountains. Since this course is set against the ocean on Kauai's green North Shore, the winds can become quite strong, so make sure to plan ahead and bring extra golf balls. Conclude your day at the Princeville Clubhouse and walk downstairs to Roy Yamaguchi's Tavern at Princeville where you can treat yourself to a Mai Tai, some Island poké or a cheeseburger with Katsu bacon.

Gold Course at Wailea Golf Club  Four Seasons Resort Maui at Wailea  100 Wailea Golf Club Dr.  Wailea, HI 96753  The Gold Course at Wailea makes a great first impression with memorable views of the ocean and the Molokini islet. Architect Robert Trent Jones, Jr. worked the land's prehistoric lava rock and the natural rise and fall of the terrain into the design of the course. This ""thinking player's course"" is the most challenging of Wailea's three courses, but offers four tee boxes at each hole to allow visitors to play at their own pace and skill level.

They also have sea ray and fish feeding which was free and fun for adults and kids alike. It is a must do/see at the resort.

322196248,50,Beautiful Property,"We have been to this property twice. We love the two floor buildings spread amongst the beautiful natural landscaping. This is one of the most beautiful properties we have ever stayed at with such low density. We stayed in the King's Pond area and near the beach. We loved our terraced breakfast with ocean and beach views. We had a credit everyday towards breakfast and due to that fabulous view we paid just a little extra to eat there every morning. I loved our outdoor shower with lava rock walls and a garden of orchids. The room is simple but elegant. Ice and fresh water in a carafe refreshed twice a day, thick towels, slippers, robes and other 5 star amenities.We also sat at King's Pond beach as it was quiet and we enjoyed the private beach feel. There were also sea turtles who swam and sunned beside us. KPB does not have the full amenity program but we wandered down the beach to the main pool and the adult pool at Palm Grove to imbibe the pops and adult amenity beverages at 3pm. Thanks to Samuel for taking care of us even though we were just temporary beach goers but the staff at each pool was friendly and just terrific! FS has a wonderful amenity program at most of the pools with hourly surprises including cold towels and sunglass cleaning. There is sunscreen and fresh fruit water at each pool.    The gym had separate (but adjacent) buildings for cardio, cycling, weights and a spa building all surrounding a lap pool. Well maintained and clean equipment. Anyone can use the steam, sauna, cold and hot tubs not just spa clients.    Ate at Beachtree by main pool and Ulu. Enjoyed Ulu a lot- fabulous elegant atmosphere and view, great servers and very good food. Fine dining with soufflés and all! Beachtree was okay but it was nice to eat dinner with live music.    The staff everywhere at the resort from valet, concierge and housekeeping extremely friendly and polite. This service sets FS apart from all other Big Island hotels. Well worth the expense.

322033650,50,Likely my very favorite Four Seasons,"This Four Seasons is heaven -- beautiful grounds, attentive service, good food and it is also has a relaxed atmosphere. There is an emphasis on keeping things as easy as possible. The check-in experience is very personal -- after receiving a lei, the clerk shows you to a couch, gives you a refreshing lightly alcoholic drink and a slice of pineapple and then goes over your reservation. It's a lovely touch.  The property is very large and you're taken to your room in a golf cart. We had a suite near the north end of the property and it was nearly perfect -- on the water, lanai, two full baths. My only complaint was that the room did not get cool enough at night even with the AC on max. I asked for a lighter duvet, but that is not a request that can be accommodated.

321252819,50,Avoid This Place At All Costs Unless...,"You want to be coddled and cared for by some of the nicest people on the island of Hawaii.    It started off with a pre-arrival conversation with Front Desk Manager, Alexi Argyris. We booked our trip with the AMEX Platinum card which provides a complimentary room upgrade, breakfast (actually ~$66 credit towards the cold breakfast which covers the meal excluding a tip) and internet service. So, I wanted to check on the room upgrade before arrival as we were celebrating a special event. Alexi didn't hesitate to confirm an outstanding room upgrade in a great location (close to the Spa & Fitness Center, Ulu restaurant, Kings Pond and one of the pools).    I wanted to thank Alexi personally for assisting us and met up with him at the front desk. We talked about his tenure at Four Seasons (including Lanai and Philadelphia properties) and traced some of his history back to his upbringing in Greece (I was in one of those social states during this vacation where I really wanted to get to know people). What a charismatic gentleman. He is destined for a great career in hospitality.    Prior to our arrival I received an email from the hotel informing me that the Annual Iron-Man Event would be taking place the day we arrived and that Police would be directing people South on the main road leading out from the airport which would be away from the hotel (the hotel was the last turn off on the main road North before the road closing). To help avoid any issues with Police and to avoid a lengthy circuitous drive, the hotel arranged for a greeter to meet us at baggage claim at the airport. The greeter provided us a copy of our itinerary to share with the Police officer which would allow us to head north to the hotel. Don't believe we have had any experience like this before. What an exceptional guest experience.    While my wife and I had been to Hawaii almost annually since 1983 (our honeymoon) I had never spent the time to truly understand the culture and background of the Hawaiian people (not something I am proud of). When I found out that they had a cultural center, I jumped at the chance to correct the error of my ways. That is where I met Uncle Earl, Manager of the Cultural Center, Auntie Halani and Auntie Elaine. Lovely people who genuinely cared about us and very knowledgeable about the islands. They were even kind enough to play Hawaiian music on their Ukuleles, danced and sang for us. Don't miss out on a visit to the Cultural Center and be sure to speak with them.    The Spa & Fitness Center was fantastic. Center provided facilities for Pilates, Yoga, Weights, Cardio, Lap Pool along with your typical Spa Treatments. While we didn’t take advantage of any treatments this trip we used just about everything else. Enola, the Manager of the Center, even went out of her way to get me access to some equipment to allow me to continue some physical therapy exercises.    Would be remiss if I didn’t comment about the great quality of the food at the three restaurants we ate at (Beach Tree, Ulu and Beach House). All were great meals. Well, you probably know where I am going next, the employees at the restaurants were exceptional, from the hostesses, to the servers to the bussers. Very attentive and caring about our every need. We spent time speaking with all of the staff throughout our stay and met up with Food & Beverage Manager in Training, Shelby Kuyawa. She is the Energizer Bunny on steroids. Took very good care of us. When we returned to our room later that day we were greeted with chocolate covered strawberries. What a thoughtful touch.    With everything and everyone was so fantastic, I would like to add some additional commentary on possible improvements at the resort. First, the rooms are showing a bit of their age and would benefit from some updating. Nothing terrible, but just time. Second, the baked goods at the buffet breakfast are not up to the high standards experienced everywhere else. The bagels weren’t very fresh and the pastries could use some tender loving care.

316457146,40,"Older and wiser, re-reviewing the Hualalai.","After my second trip to the Hualalai, at least five years later and many trips and resort experiences wiser, it seemed necessary to write a new review. We stayed at the resort during late Sept. 2015 and were able to get our room for 695/night using an Amex Platinum deal which included free breakfast for two and usually, a one category room upgrade. The room we booked was their lowest category, I believe it's called golf or garden view. Upon check in we were told there were no upgrades available which was disappointing because there were many rooms available on their website. We mentioned this and they said the exact category of room that is the upgrade from our room was not available. Seemed kinda lame but what can you do? Went to our room. Same location as our last trip which is in the Outer-Mongolia of the resort. If we ever go back we would just suck up the extra $ and book at least a poolside room as the room we had was up the hill and around the corner from everything else and pretty far back from the ocean views, breezes and sounds. The room itself was only fine. Nothing special in decor, size or amenities. Our turn down was done after 8:30 every night and since we weren't adjusted to the time we were ready for bed before that and just said never mind a couple of times. I finally got smart enough to ask when it was supposed to be and they said between 6 and 9, I assume they give those room last priority. Also, no water provided in the rooms, the windows are covered with shutters that don't really get dark enough and one morning a guy actually walked into our room by mistake at around 4:30 am. It's unclear whether he used a key or the door was ajar. My husband swears he heard the beeping of the key pad. Room situation: 2 points. Usually this place is about $1000/might for the lowest price room. It should be way, way better. Onward to the beach and pool!    We arrived around 2:30 (to be honest, our room wasn't ready but the review flows better this way!) The beach did not have any umbrellas, only lounger's that have a cover you pull over, they call them copacabanas. I have really fair skin and had to get some shade so we went on to the ""Adult Pool"" which has a swim up bar which is why we chose it! One thing I love is a swim up bar on a hot day so I was pretty pleased this was an option. Unfortunately, they take the concept a little to literally at the FS as there are no seats to sit on. You just order your drink and go. Turns out the bartender was pretty rude so I guess swimming away was the better option. To me, this pool missed the point of an ""adult pool"" with a swim up bar. It's supposed to be fun and a little bit of a party, not like Vegas mind you, but maybe some low music and fun cocktail selections. Nope, it was pretty boring (did I mention I am well into my fourth decade, doesn't take much to make it fun for me) They also have a ""quiet pool,"" a kids pool and a snorkeling pond. Lot's of choices and after being there for a few days we decided the best place to hang out was the beach lounger's in front of the quiet pool. The pools are all done in a very understated style with dark slate tiling and weathered wooden decks. At first I didn't really like them but as the week went on I started to appreciate their natural style and the way it mixed with the ocean, palms, sandy beaches, etc. So, pool area: 4+    Beach: The Big Island is very rocky and has few natural beaches. I believe the FS has imported the sand and so has created a sandy stretch that is nice to hang out on but the water itself is very rocky and you swim in most areas. There is one spot that has been formed into a sort of sheltered swimming area and you can go in there but there aren't any waves. So, if you're looking to boogie board or dive under waves, this beach doesn't cut it. If you just want to look out at a beautiful ocean vista then it's great! They do not have beach umbrellas so you have to use the covered lounges which can get hot if there is no breeze and block your view on the sides. Plus they only fit two people. We also had an unpleasant experience with the pool/beach staff. There were a few loungers under the shade of a tree that we asked to use and were told they were reserved. Two hours later, we asked again, still ""reserved."" Eventually, around 3:00 pm people came to sit in these loungers. Guess I didn't tip enough? To add insult to injury, the next day, I was sitting on a lounger in the am and they asked if I wanted towels and I said, sure, these are nice seats, I'll be back after breakfast. ""We only hold them for 30 minutes"" she said. Seriously? So lame. Just so you know, there were plenty of loungers. You could always get a seat, except maybe at the adult pool. You can also walk about a half mile down a path to another beach area where there is a little beach club that is available to hotel guests. They have masks and snorkels, etc. and some really great snorkeling. We saw rays, turtles, TONS of fish, coral, etc. Definitely worth the trip down there. They also have stand up boards and canoes for a fee. Beach: 3.5 points    Food: Here is where I was the most pleased. The breakfast was fantastic. There is a buffet with a lot of options including a very gourmet omelette bar, lots of local produce, a smoothie bar, great fruit, pastries, etc. They also have menu selections and my breakfast was really fantastic every day. We also ate lunch and dinner almost every day and all of our meals were excellent barring the one we ate at the members beach club, that meal was sub par. We particularly liked to eat at the main beach bar. The bartenders always had time to talk about their favorite dishes and they steered us to some great choices! 5 points    Service: For a resort of this caliber you expect a little bit more. We have been to Some five star resorts in Mexico, the US and Europe and feel like we know what to expect. For us it usually means unfailing politeness, staff willing to attempt special requests and then remember some of those preferences the next time, prompt service, clean, plentiful towels, water, etc. and relatively few hassles/problems. In this we did not feel the FS lived up to it's star count. Too many little irritations. Fine for a lower price point but not for 600+ a night. Service: Some highs, some lows 3 points for the price.    Spa: Didn't have any services. Nice lap pool, steam, etc. large and attractive. Other's said they had great massages.    Golf: Didn't golf. Nice clubhouse.    Kids: Seemed like they had a lot of things for kids to do in safe, protected pools, lagoons, etc.    Wifi: The ""complimentary"" wifi was too slow to download a tv show. The premium ($25/day) was good.    Average: Room, Pool, Service, Beach, Food 3.5 stars total. Not a choice on TA!    My final evaluation: For couples, it's romantic and beautiful, if you have $ to burn. For Families with small children (i.e. under 8 or 9) pretty good option. Families with active kids/teens who don't just want to lounge, probably too quiet with not enough beach action.",Oct 2015,September 2015,Traveled as a couple,Probably worth the $ to upgrade to at least poolside.,Southern california

The food, the spa offerings, the cocktails (especially at the Palm Grove pool's bar), the nightly music at Beach Tree — everything about this place is perfect.    We booked a Golf View room but were upgraded to an Ocean View room and it was so lovely. Our room was on the first floor, so we had an outdoor lava rock shower in addition to a regular (and roomy!) indoor shower. While the 2nd-floor rooms have killer views of the ocean, that lava rock shower is such a unique feature that I think it's worth booking the 1st-floor rooms instead. After all, if you want an unobstructed view of the ocean, it's steps from your door anyway.

315062381,50,"Great hotel, one of the best, stupid pool policy, B team during the holidays","Have stayed here numerous times. One of the best hotels in the world. Echo the sentiments of another guest on the pool policy. I was barred from swimming laps in the main pool even though there was literally no one else swimming. Hotel staff was adamant about this, borderline rude. I get their policy but when no one else is swimming (and it was raining that day and it was also 7am), I don't get why they would even police this. Overall, I've found during the holidays that the staff isn't as good relative to off-peak times...likely because they have to hire more folks to handle additional volume. In the end, I usually always enjoy coming here but I've found the service has declined over the years and the hotel will be in need of a makeover in the near future.",Sep 2015,December 2014,Traveled with family,,

We got married on the beach and had our honeymoon there.The service was exceptional, the food was great and the views were amazing.  Some tips if you are planning a trip there.  If you are going as a couple I strongly recommend getting a room near the palm grove pool. It is a beautiful, peaceful infinity pool with a swim up bar overlooking the ocean.  We had a ocean view ground floor room and it was very nice. I really recommend being on the ground floor, You can easily walk in and out of your patio right to the pool without going up and down stairs. Plus you get the outdoor Lava rock shower and a nice view of the ocean. The only advantage of being on the second floor is a better view of the ocean but the convenience of the first floor walkout far exceeds anything else.  We were at the hotel in September so it was fairly quiet and never an issue getting a chair at the pool or the beach.  All the restaurants were great but our favorite was the beach tree. Also don't forget about the Residence restaurant at the far end,,best salmon ever!  The breakfast brunch at Uli was fantastic.....everything you can ask for with a great view right on the ocean.  A few employees of the hotel deserve special recognition.  Alicia, our wedding planner, was fantastic and was always there for us to make sure everything went smoothly.  Manny, bartender at the plam grove pool swim up bar, is a great guy and makes a great Mai Tai!  Alexi, front desk manager, really made us feel special and I really enjoyed talking to him!  Just be advised...this hotel is for a beautiful, quiet, relaxing vacation. Last reservations for dinner is around 830 and there really isn't any nightlife. The BEST thing to do at night before bed is to go swimming in the pools late night. The water is perfect and its peaceful and relaxing!  We didn't want to leave and I cant wait to go back!!

The room was tranquil and well-situated for walks to the beach or pool or breakfast. The grounds are delightful and the food at each restaurant was amazing. Favorite meal is breakfast with ""Dan the Eggman"" making eggs to order along with refills on your fresh juice every 2 minutes. I had an injury and at the pool, our attendant brought me a bag of ice every day to help me heal! That's superior service and I can't name another hotel as personal and responsive. The beach is rocky and you couldn't rush out there and swim around very far. The pools are beautiful and cater to adult v family. In the afternoons, they bring complimentary ice pops (some with adult drinking choices - nice). Only beef is, I thought they keep the temperature of the pools much too warm. That's me, though.

310692186,30,"Hard to accurately rate, but I feel that I must!","First of all I need to say that this is my first review on TripAdvisor. I just felt so strongly about this hotel that I needed to review it.    I stayed for a week over the summer after visiting all of the other islands and staying at Four Seasons each time.    The dilemma with this hotel is that it just does not have a beach. There's no nice way to put it. No matter how they groom the beach, how they rope off a section, how there's a 10 minute walk to a great beach, etc, they just do NOT have a swimmable beach. It's lava rock and unless you want to wear shoes to swim, it's bad.    The 10 minute walk (which is longer than that unless you are walking a good pace) gets to you another lava beach that they laid sand bags to walk out on. However, with the water moving around you, you will move off of the sandbag walk and hit the lava.    I go to Hawaii for the beach. Otherwise I would go stay at a resort in Phoenix with great pools. To say this is a 5 star resort and not have a swimmable beach is not acceptable to me. Granted it is nature and nature is not always smooth sand beaches. That's fine. I understand nature. But nobody really tells the picture of the beach at this hotel well enough to understand that it's just not enjoyable swimming there.    I did take a short drive up the coast to another hotel that has public beach access and it was the exact beach that you want in Hawaii - nice sand beaches, easy on the feet, and swimmable.    The rest of the hotel is a perfect 5 stars. The rooms are great. The adult pool is great. The man made snorkel pond is great. The food is great. No complaints at all!    However, if I go to Hawaii, it will be to another island with another Four Seasons that has a beach that you can swim and snorkel at. Maui comes to mind as a charmer :-)    I hope you understand that my review clearly states that the hotel is excellent, except that there really is NO beach that is usable.

309697108,30,Gorgeous property BUT Poor Service for Four Seasons standards,"This is an absolutely beautiful sprawling property in Kona which is all you could ask for in Hawaii. The snorkeling is great by the canoe house, pools were picturesque, and food at the various restaurants were very good. However, for the absolutely incredibly high price to stay here, there were definitely missteps in the service.    1. We ordered a soda while staying in a pool cabana. Soda tasted flat, so we brought this up with the attendant (whom we had to flag down) and the response was : 'I don't know why, it came out of a can'. We asked for the soda to be changed - diet Pepsi first, then switched to diet coke. When the bill came, we were charged for both!! This is despite the fact we returned the initial glass pretty full. Unacceptable especially since they charge $4 / glass. I didn't realize this until much later though.  2. Last lunch before leaving at the Beach Tree Cafe. When we paid for the meal in cash, we received the change for $100 bill ($25 for 2 tacos by the way), we were figuring out tip. Apparently, they shorted us $20 in change. Again, so inappropriate for a four seasons caliber hotel. They apologized, but you wonder a little....  3. Finally, we received an email hours after we electronically checked out which updated our bill to charge us an additional $60 for taking their coffee bag beach tote. Well, we did not take the tote at all so I had to call them and tell them to remove the bill. They did, but no apologies at all for their mistake.    3 strikes in my opinion for a five star super expensive hotel.

308391464,50,Excellent - but missing a soul,"OK - so Four Seasons Hualalai is one of two properties in Hawaii that has a Forbes five star rating. It is routinely rated the best hotel in Hawaii and indeed one of the best in the US. And it is great - even excellent. But there is something missing (...and I will get back to that later)  The resort itself is majestically located along the rocks and (small) beaches of western Hawaii (Big Island). This is the sunny and dry area of a island that otherwise gets an enourmous amount of rain. Dotted around the hotel are some of the most expensive vacation homes in the world, either facing the sea or the two fantastic golf courses. The whole area is gated and a green oasis among the black lava landscape.  The facilities are world class, and apart from the golf there is outstanding spa, tennis and fitness areas. The grounds are amazing with special honors to the many gardeners attending the thousand of flowers, bushes, trees and many lakes. It is indeed beautiful. The suites are in 33 two story houses spread out over the very large property. They are excellent and for once I would actually recommend the first floor rooms due to their ""hidden"" romantic outdoor showers. Bathrooms are large as are the walk in closets and the outdoor patio/terracces. All with excellent and high quality furninishings.  There are four large pool areas facing the sea - each with their own ambiance and favoured clientel. One is heated to nearly hot-tub temperature and features a popular swim up to bar, another one is clearly geared towards kids while one is infact a seawater pool with 4000 fishes and its own matra. Here one can swim among lots of exotic species, feed them in the morning and listen to the in-house oceanorgapher. Outstanding!  A large notice to those that love beaches - they are at best OK. And unfortunatly in Hawaii; un-surfable. (Although if you ask - the consierge will arrange for the great Dominic at Kona Surf Company to help you. He will get ANYONE up. But it is a 30 minute drive away. )  There are 4 restaurant - all good. Ulu is by FAR the best of them - and serves excellent locally sourced food in a beautifull setting. Special mention to the Ahi Poke - it is really delicious and my wife ordered it 3 days in a row!  So is great, is it not?  Well not quite. What is lacking is that ""je ne se quoi"" that makes the Eden Roc, Le Surinuse, the Mandarin Oriental, the various Aman hotels so alluring. The staff are nice, the food is nice, the sports facilities are (more than..) nice. But the Hualalai lacks soul, it lacks joy - in fact it lacks fun. A vacation is supposed to be fun is it not?  So while I certainly loved being there 5 days, and would recommend it to anyone - I think that management needs to inject spirit, joy and a bit of frolic into the place.  (So being a bit of a managemt consultant may I recommend the following improvements:  * new towels! All the resort towels were past their due date and infact a bit low class  * new chefs with new menues at the Grill and the Beach Place  * remove the loose rocks and stones from at least one of the beaches so that it is pleasant to use. Today it is more of a risky adventure  * last, but most important - send selected personell and local managemt to learn pride, joy and fun by staying a night at the nearby Holualoa Inn.",Sep 2015,September 2015,Traveled with family,We found the rooms in the 29 to 32 houses the best.

307961538,30,Spotty Service,"This Four Seasons falls short of Four Season Maui. The food and service was spotty. Sometimes at FS level, other times far short. They are responsive if you speak up and call them out, but half the time they fall back into their poor habits. The squeaky wheel gets the grease will work, but I'm not here to keep their staff on their toes. I'm on vacation and I wish to have Four Seasons level service without having to call them out.    Service Review:    Check-in: 5 stars (although, if they offer, don't let them upgrade you for free with out checking out where the upgraded room is. It might be in a less desirable area; long walk, noisy area, etc) than your original room.    Concierge: 5 stars plus. They're amazing. They'll recommend and arrange (white glove service) amazing adventures and day trips.    Room/Maid Service: 5 stars.    Beachfront Service (Towel, Food & Beverage): 5 stars plus    Sea Shell Pool (Family Pool): 4 star with towel and chair setup, food and beverage service: did not use, but looked ok    Beach Tree Pool (Quiet Pool): 2 star, chair set-up: 4 star; towel service: 3 star, generally you hunt down your own towels, Beverage Service: 1 star!    I watched the staff congregate and hang out when they were supposed to be working, incomplete service circuits of the pool, little to no eye contact with guests when they weren't clustering in the shack. On multiple days I went 3-4 hours without water or an offer of a beverage. Eventually I waved someone down and gave them what-for, and they snapped up the service level, but they easily slipped into their former bad habits.    Palm Grove Pool (Adult Pool): 4 stars. The general service was fine, but the bartenders were not very skilled. They could make the popular, high volume drinks fine, but ask for anything outside of that (nothing exotic) and it was a pour it in the bushes drink.    Amenities Review: 5 star    Beach: 4 star: small and a little rocky (expected at the big island), but enjoyable for modest periods of time. You probably won't spend your whole day there. Pools are better.    Pools: 5 star: all the pools are very nice    Rooms: 5 star (even if some of them are a long walk)    Food Review (limited food options at all dining establishments on campus; nearest off-campus sites are 30 minute drive):    Hulu Ocean Grill (the only place open for breakfast): 5 stars; Food: 4+ stars; Service: 5 stars    Beach Tree (near family pool, lunch and dinner) 4+ stars: Food: 4+ stars, Service: 4+ stars    Hualalai Grill (dinner) 2 stars: Food: Fish- 1 star (all fish was over cooked), Steak- 3 star (good, but not great), prepared well; Service: 2 star (first time was terrible, second time was great- likely because I had complained)    Overall: Good, but not Four Seasons good.

There are 5 pools-Kids Pool/Serenity Pool (which is what it sounds like)/Adult Pool with swim up bar/Lagoon where you could snorkel(and feed a stingray once a day) and a Lap Pool at the fitness area.There is also a small beach where you could snorkel and sometimes see the turtles in their natural habitat (we also saw a couple of turtles sunning themselves on the beach.)The fitness area was great,lots of different exercise equipment rooms as well as lots of class offerings including Spinning,Pilates and Yoga.This area is also where the Spa is located which has outdoor jacuzzi and cold plunge pool as well as a steam room.There were enough offerings of outdoor activities plus exercise classes to keep all 5 adults with different interests happy.    The buffet breakfast was great and sumptuous served at the Ulu restaurant which is right on the beach and a great way to start the day.We did have issues getting dinner reservations at night since we were a party of 5 and the Resort was at 100% capacity (although it did not feel like it).I would definitely make reservations for dinners when you book your trip to avoid the hassle as there is no other place outside the Resort close by to eat (Kona is a $50 approx cab ride each way-30mins away)    We did not rent a car because we didn't really want to leave the Resort .The hotel secured us transportation to/from Kona Airport which is 20mins away and cost approx $40 as we went with the low cost option -the hotel does offer limo service if you want but for a 20min drive probably not worth it.

But we were able to cancel and take Hualalai up on its offer. 4 nights including breakfast at a very reasonable price. We have stayed at another Four Seasons property in Hawaii so we had an inkling of what to expect. We were not disappointed. The grounds are beautifully maintained and there is so much to see on the property that one really does not need to leave at all. We were greeted by name as we drove up to the valet desk. We were then escorted to the lounge area and seated on a comfy sofa and checked in as we cooled off with cold towels, a piece of fruit and a tropical drink. Then we were escorted to a golf cart and driven around the property so we could get a good lay of the land. Following the tour we were taken to our upgraded ocean view room, complete with lanai and outside private shower. I felt like it was heaven. We ate at the Beach Tree the first night. We enjoyed drinks and a very light supper in the bar area as we watched the sunset over the water. So beautiful. The food was delicious, the drinks were satisfying, the music was great, the service friendly. Next day we had our breakfast at Ulu. So much to choose from and everything delicious. Then we sat at the big pool and were waited on hand and foot. Even their free beach lounges are far superior to the ones most resorts offer. Water, smoothies, fruit, sunglasses cleaning and really whatever we wanted was offered at least every hour, sometimes more often. We were celebrating our 43rd anniversary and were surprised with a bottle of champagne in our room one afternoon. Loved the turndown service each evening.

306464996,50,Excellence embedded in paradise,"After spending the first 6 days of our ""Hawaiian island tour"" on Maui, we were curious to arrive on the Big Island and especially at the Four Seasons. The choice of hotel was based on its best rating here on TA, so naturally expectations were high - and we were not let down. In total we stayed 10 nights here, so enough time to offer a holistic experience.    The property is embedded in a ancient Hawaiian cultural side surrounded by beautiful gardens, greenery and endless palm trees just next to the Ocean. Several pool areas offer great service, food and drinks. The beach offers very comfy sun beds with sunshades and invite to spend the day by the sea. Beware of the outstanding cocktail selection - absolute world class quality. Make sure to bring your snorkel set with you as, current permitting, you will be able swim with turtles close to the beach. Watch out for the strong currents though. If you imitate the ""flowing movements"" of the turtles, you will  be just fine.    All restaurants serve great quality food based on local and fresh produce. It always feels like an honest dining experience, no matter if in-room breakfast, pool side lunches or dinner at the restaurants. Especially the wine lists are sophisticated and do complement every dish you will select.    The rooms were superb - we slept like babies on the comfortable mattress. The keen attention to detail by the housekeeping, including the turn down service, maximized convenience and comfort in every aspect. Breakfast on the balcony overlooking garden and sea was the highlight of every morning.

303994843,30,My Ex-favorite vacation rental resort,"We have rented homes at Hualalai on numerous occasions including three times this year, and have loved it. However, I just received an email that the Four Seasons is increasing its amenity fees to rental guests from $65 per day per adult to $250 per day per adult, and to $125 per day per child during peak season. A family of four would pay $750 per day just for the ""privilege"" of using resort amenities. If you stay one week, you will pay over $5,000. for a family of four just for amenities, and a couple will pay $3500 just for amenities. Really? At these prices, I really can't even rate the resort average, but it too nice to rate lower. If I factored in the new amenity rates, I would rate it terrible, because it is not worth these prices. To be sure, there is a cost to maintaining the infrastructure of the resort (which is quite beautiful), but unless you are uber rich so that money isn't an issue for you, the amenity fee is ridiculous. I feel reasonably wealthy, but I don't see the value in paying $250 per day to sit in Four Seasons' chairs, use its towels and restrooms, buy its expensive drinks and food, and pay to use its golf course. During peak season it restricted non-hotel guests from using lounge chairs on the pool decks as they were reserved for hotel guests. Such a restriction when paying $250 per day for the USE of amenities would be outrageous. I'm wondering if it will drop this restriction. It won't matter to me, because we won't be renting at Hualalai with these amenity fees. I can't believe the new rates won't have a substantial impact on home rentals at Hualalai. Maybe if you can afford to own a home in Hualalai, that isn't that important, but given the number of homeowners who do rent their properties, I would think it is important. My speculation for the increase is that Hualalai has become too popular. With high occupancy rates, maybe congestion at the hotel has become an issue for hotel guests. Raising the amenity fee may reduce the number of non-hotel guests using hotel amenities and reduce congestion for hotel guests. When you are very popular, you can raise rates until you reach the point where you begin to lose business. Almost everyone has a limit to what they will pay. The Four Seasons has not only reached our limit, but seriously surpassed it. We will miss Hualalai.",Aug 2015,July 2015,Traveled as a couple,,Houston

303517921,50,One of the best Hotels I've ever been to,"From the outset this hotel exceeded our already very high expectations. Coming from the UK, Hawaii always seemed a bit out of reach from a distance perspective. My new boss signed off a three week vacation and we went for it. First day and I'm in the pool with William Hague and his wife. I don't normally get star struck but I've always thought he's the real deal, particularly for his work with Angelina Jolie, and I told him so which was a bit embarrassing but what the heck.  The hotel itself is remarkable, rooms are all well equipped with usual Four Seasons linen, comfy beds, pillows etc. with our rooms overlooking the sea and the quiet pool. The pools are beautiful with one being a nature pond filled with fish and a scary manta ray which kept me thinking of Steve Irwin or Coogan as my mother in law memorably called him.  The gym and spa are extremely well equipped with state of the art equipment and water, towels etc on permanent stand by.  The service by the pools and the beach is incredible with frozen pineapple and water coming around almost too frequently.  If you're from the UK prepare yourself for the time difference I.e 11 hours behind. I deliberately woke up early every day, went to the gym and then did a full days e mail supping the wonderful local coffee overlooking the ocean.  Reservations - I have two - the sea is beautiful and inviting but with all the solid lava you can't really swim in it easily (certainly not the Four Seasons' fault). The other is the restaurants which although expensive enough to suggest Michelin stars are very definitely not. They are good enough but with steaks costing $55 you'd expect something a little more Helene Darroze. Of the three we went to Ulu is the best and the golf restaurant the worst. One other minor niggle was that the website advertised a teenage club but there wasn't one which made things a little difficult for our 16 year old son. That said being parked in paradise for 9 days hardly evokes sympathy.  I can definitely get over my reservations and would happily brave the flight with a couple of stopovers in LA or SF and come back.",Aug 2015,August 2015,Traveled with family,Go as expensive as you can afford - sea view and sunsets are worth every penny.,"Sittingbourne, United Kingdom"

302679824,50,"4 Days or 14, Just Go","My husband and I came here for a long weekend, just 4 days over 4th of July. It was so good that my husband begged me to consider extending the stay, but I had to get back to work.    Pros:  Location: This was our first trip to the Big Island. I did my research so I knew that we wouldn't be driving through jungle to get there. The lava landscape was just gorgeous and surreal though. Once you get to the sprawling resort, it's as lusciously verdant as any Hawaiian dream you could imagine. We loved that there was very little development and that it felt a little less discovered. As luxurious as the Four Seasons is, this is not a glitzy or glam feeling place.    The resort: First of all, it's huge! That means you will spend a bunch of time walking around, or in golf carts, which I don't mind. And as reviewers have said, you don't need to leave the resort. We did leave, however, and are glad we did. More on that later. The resort is really above and beyond though, wonderful amenities, activities, food, service... and beauty! The amount of work that must have gone in to to plan a resort with 5 pools and a golf course carved out from the lava is just insane. It's a stunning place that feels unique and unpretentious, but special.    Food: We LOVED the food here. I was a little worried, because it's really pretty far from other restaurants. From the 4th of July BBQ event to the chef's table at ULU, it was all great quality and yet super varied. We never made it to the steakhouse (it's indoors and we wanted to maximize our outdoor time), but if we come back for longer, we will certainly end up there. We especially liked the little resident's restaurant for casual but super high quality food. I went to the general store to pick up spam musubi as well- because we're in Hawaii! Is this the best food we've ever had in our lives? No, but it's darn good, and it certainly gets me excited to go back.    Activities: As most reviews will probably attest to, the best activity on the resort is lounging, either poolside or beach side. You'll get friendly attendants catering to your every whim while you stare at the gorgeous view and take a dip every time you get warm. The spa!!! Oh man, that is a good spa. The massage rooms are their own little bungalows, and the masseurs are super top notch. I love the fact that there are so many pools and a massive gym (not that I went to the gym once), but I will say that I was slightly underwhelmed by the salt water pool, although I'm glad it exists and it's probably perfect for children. I thought that the visibility was poor. The enclosed beach area was pretty cool though! There was a sea turtle chilling out in there the first time I went. Also, I don't golf, but apparently the golfing is great? Shrugs.    Our main activity was scuba diving. This has nothing to do with the hotel, although the concierge did a great job setting it up with our vendor, but I def recommend it. Because of the scuba, we didn't get to take a helicopter tour, which is something i would have loved to do, but the scuba was fantastic! I especially recommend the night time manta ray dive. It was otherworldly. We also swam with dolphins which was surreal too. Take advantage of Hawaii and get out there into the water for real!    It's great that it's a direct flight from California so you can get away for a short getaway. But, suffice to say, we would not have gotten bored if we'd stayed longer (and then we could have gotten to try way more of the food, which I would have loved)!    Cons:  While this it's such a gorgeously done resort and the service is top notch, we went over 4th of July and it was CROWDED. This is to be expected, but there are some resorts that can still feel like you're just in your own little world when they are maximally occupied. Most four seasons are pretty full of kids, but this one felt like kids were just swarming everywhere. I'm OK with that, but just keep it in mind over holidays. While it's still romantic, it kinda sorta felt like a Disneyland sometimes.    Additional Tips: You need an ocean view, make sure you get that at least. The shops in the resort are top notch. I super splurged! If you want to grab food off resort, go to Umekes and get poke.",Aug 2015,July 2015,Traveled as a couple,,California
301533424,50,Avoid August in Hawaii if you can,"This is a beautifully located,expansive and luxurious property where we spent five nights in a very expensive waterfront ,upper level suite ,which was excellent. On arrival,however,despite the pleasantness of staff,the apologies for delays,and the constant ""alohas"", we were left forgotten in the foyer long after we had been told our room was ready and it was only when we expressed irritation that it led to something happening. In addition, concierge staff were unable to get us into any of the four restaurants in the three hour period between 6pm and 9pm for the first two nights!! In addition we couldn't get our spa credit activated together. Our immediate reaction was disappointment ,disbelief, and a conviction that this "" world class"" hotel was overbooked relative to the staff and facilities. This was certainly not a ""world class"" start for us, compared with our stays in truly ""world class"" hotels in Asia. Thankfully, Dakota Smith intervened on our behalf and amongst other things,got us into the Grille,which in our time there proved not to be as busy as we had been led to believe,which further confused us about booking restrictions and insistence of concierge that it was fully booked. Despite the poor start,mostly we think from the large number of visitors in August school holidays, things did get better. Petra was a gem on the concierge desk and helped us organise tours and arrange a romance turn down service which the hotel had not provided as promised on the first night. During our stay things got better and we loved our room and balcony overlooking the ocean,(although again,it falls short of the value for money of Asian 5 star properties) and the standard of cuisine at the restaurants. In the end we were convinced that we would have had an infinitely more personal experience here if we could have avoided August as all the hallmarks of a great resort are present,but for us this busy period diminished the experience,especially at check in and when booking restaurants and spa.",Aug 2015,August 2015,Traveled as a couple,A suite overlooking the ocean is excellent but expensive.,"Brisbane, Australia"
301275036,40,Service isn't up to Four Seasons Standards,"We have been to the Four Seasons Hualalai 4 times over the past 15 years. It is spectacular. That said, we were there two weeks ago and we were surprised by the drop in service and also by the addition of tons of fees on everything.    We booked the hotel under a promotional rate (which we've done in the past). When we got to the hotel, we were asked for ID for this rate (which we were never asked for before) and since we did not have it on us we paid the full rate and send the ID immediately upon returning home (as the hotel asked us to do). It took us reaching out to Corporate and their intervention to get the discounted rate instituted--at least 7 calls, 3 emails and was very difficult and time consuming for something basic (not the Four Seasons service we're accustomed to).    In addition, the resort has changed---they used to hand out tons of fresh fruit and other things by the pool--this is done rarely now. A tiny soda by the pool is $5 or $6 with no refill. Gym classes are all $20-$40. There are day beds for rent everywhere. No one of these things is much of an issue but the constant trying to charge for everything and lack of generosity when rates themselves are very high for the room was a clear departure of previous years. We came away feeling like the hotel was trying to nickel and dime us for everything.

Each little unit of rooms has its own laundry room which is quite important since we have been travelling with 4 children for quite a while!  The restaurants all serve great food and the service is brilliant. The settings are gorgeous. The selection and service at breakfast was outstanding however there was always a tiny wait for a table in the morning so it is best to come early!  There are several pools including a snorkeling pond filled with tropical fish, a quiet pool, a kids pool, a lap pool and an adult pool. So it never really felt too crowded.  The only negative about this hotel is that the area where you can actually swim in the ocean is rather small and very stoney so not too good for children to go in. Also rather boring as there are no waves. Since this area is quite small the loungers on that beach are basically taken from 6am onwards. They do assure you that you can not reserve loungers but we saw a few times that loungers were reserved for either residents, regular guests or guests who tip the beach attendant with $100. Also if you don't tip accordingly or are not a resident the service you get on the beach is not good. No drinks and no fresh towels.  However the service by the quiet pool was excellent!

As July was high season, Timothy said that they only had a couple of rooms available, so I did not hesitate and placed my deposit to secure the room.    We packed our bags the following day and moved down to the FS as fast as we could. Checking in was a different experience altogether as we sat down on comfortable couches and sipped on mai tai's (instead of standing at the front desk counter) while the friendly staff member reviewed the room and resort with us. I felt more than relaxed immediately.    Dusty had our bags loaded up and ready to go on a golf cart and gave us a quick but informative tour of the property. The resort consisted of a series of bungalows amidst a garden oasis of beautiful foliage. There were five different pools: one for the 21 and over crowd, one main quiet pool, one large infinity edge pool for families, one small pool with a sandy beach for the young ones, and a lap pool near the spa. There was also King's pond, a man made pond of brackish water that was filled with over 4000 fish for the guests to snorkel in a serene setting. We got to see a spotted eagle ray while snorkeling there one day.    Having stayed a several FS properties previously, I knew that their basic rooms were larger than the average hotel room, but we were introduced to room 3702, which was a superior suite that had over 1000 sq ft of space. The suite consisted of a living area with a sofa bed and its own bathroom and shower, and the main bedroom had a walk in closet, a huge bathroom and an outdoor shower set in a serene garden surrounded by a lava wall. Our suite had a beautiful view of the 18th fairway and green, and we could the blue Pacific ocean beyond.    Everywhere we went, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful and acknowledged us by name. The pool attendants kept our drinks filled with ice and even brought the menu from the nearby Beach Tree restaurant so that we can taste their food poolside without having to walk to the restaurant itself. Talk about service! Even though the resort was filled with guests, it did not feel overcrowded. We also tried the two main restaurants for dinner, and although both places offered phenomenal cuisine, we preferred 'Ulu over the Hualalai Grille. The breakfast buffet at 'Ulu was amazing with the typical made to order omelet station AND a made to order pancake station.    The tennis facility and golf course were topnotch. The only thing that we didn't partake in was the spa. That's for the next visit.    Overall, it is not inexpensive to stay at a luxury resort as the Four Seasons Hualalai, but we felt that it was more than worth the expense. As we have had the opportunity to visit the FS on Maui and the two FS properties on Lanai, I'm anxious to visit the new property on Oahu next summer.

295496815,50,Can't Wait to Return..It Truly is the Best Resort in the World,"My husband and I recently traveled to Four Seasons Hualalai for our honeymoon. We were greeted by name at the valet when we arrived. There was no check-in at a desk, rather we were escorted to an exquisite, open-air lobby by Nick where we were able to relax on a couch with leis and mai tais while we went over our stay with him. Nick then gave us a tour of the property before bringing us and our luggage to our room. Before leaving Nick gave us fresh water and filled our ice bucket. The room itself was well-decorated, filled with high-end bath products and lotions, and the lava rock shower with orchid garden was to die for. Let's just say we did not shower indoors once during our stay. In addition, there were chocolates and a bottle of champagne for us to enjoy as we began our honeymoon stay.    Throughout our time at the resort we received amazing service. Everyone greeted us by name, and cooperatively worked together to ensure that as guests we were always beyond satisfied. In addition to the outstanding service, the scenery and grounds were meticulously planned out and well-maintained. We loved that all of the restaurants were open-air and right off the beach. We enjoyed breakfast at Ulu each morning, and for lunch we preferred to take the walk down to Residents Beach House or order food by the pool. As far as dinners went, Ulu was fabulous (we went there multiple times) and Hualalai Grille was good for a steak.    The pools were right off the beach as well. We enjoyed that no matter where you were in the main section of the resort, you were always by the ocean. This allowed for great views of the gorgeous sunset every night.    During our stay we also did the private Dinner Under the Stars. The afternoon before our dinner we were able to meet with the chef and plan out our menu (and by plan out I mean basically we could pick anything we wanted!). The night of our dinner was absolutely perfect. We had a fabulous guitar player during cocktail hour (we begged him to stay a little longer), wonderful service from Jeff (he even took lots of pictures for us), and incredible food from the chef. In addition, we also added the wine pairings to our dinner. These were great, and the pairings were spot on, but it was definitely a little too much wine for me.    Other things we enjoyed during our stay were snorkeling in Kings Pond (right on the resort), laying by the gorgeous pools and lava rock beaches (on the resort), checking out the numerous green turtles, an island helicopter tour to see the volcano and North Shore (Blue Hawaiian Helicopter Tours), snorkeling with the Manta Rays (Kona Sea Adventures), a private photography session (Fletch Photography), and a hike over lava rock to Makalawena beach.    All in all we could not have asked for a better resort, better service, or a better location for our honeymoon. The Four Seasons Hualalai was true perfection.

Several pools, some for kids, one for adults 21 and over, a pond where you can snorkel in (with many fish in it), even a sports pool for swimming laps, tennis and of course golf.    Talking about sports: You can do every kind of sports if you can tear yourself away from the beach...    The resort has 3 main restaurants, from which we tried two. We were not fond of the Beach Tree, but liked Usu (Seafood / Japanese) for dinner quite a bit. See my separate reviews.    The staff and management is great. Many helping hands. My daughter got sick and we got Gatorade and power bars delivered to our room without even asking for it.    We stayed in a room with partial ocean view.    This is in the ground floor of a house with two floors.  The room was nice, but you could hear the guests from above. Not very loud but you could hear them. Also the mini bar fridge was quite noisy.    If we come back - and I hope we will - I would go for a room in the upper floor. This is $100 more and I guess worth it.    Talking about money: This is one of the leading resorts of the world at one of the most beautiful places on the planet.    Of course you have to pay for this. You will see stiff charges everywhere.

As sad as we were to not stay at Kona Village, closed due to Tsunami damage, we knew we had to stay here and finish off our two week Hawaiian vacation at this phenomenal Four Seasons. It is no surprise why this property was rated number 3 in the world only a few years ago. I traveled with my two children. along with my mom, her boyfriend and in laws. I cannot share enough what a spectacular stay this was. Pricey but worth every penny. You certainly get what you pay for. The grounds are impressive ( world class ) the food incredible , try and make the once a month luau ( best in Hawaii I am serious ). Try and book your stay when they have their luau. Laundry service stations throughout was such a benefit. The lava rock showers (ask for first floor so you get it ) were a big hit with the kids and the pools could not be beat. Snorkeling in Kings Pond with over 4000 fish was amazing!! I hear middle/end of July is the best time to visit as it is optimal chance for upgrades due to lighter volume. Each and every person here made you and your entire family feel special...gifts for the kids upon check in, exceptional service everywhere..from pools to restaurants, concierge, front desk to housekeeping.

294792581,50,Possibly the BEST hotel in the world!,"The Four Seasons at Hualalai is simply one of the best experiences you can have at a resort. The service, amenities, scenery and most of all the relaxing atmosphere are outstanding. We have stayed at 5 star hotels and resorts around the world and Hualalai sets the standard. It is significantly better than the other 4 Seasons we have stayed at (and many levels higher than the 4 Seasons Maui).    This is our second stay at Hualalai (the first was just me and my wife, this last time was with our 4 teenagers). From the welcoming staff, to the housekeepers, waiters and all other personnel, their training in top customer service is outstanding.    To give you just an glimpse of the little things they do, when you are walking the property at night, if an employee is driving in a golf cart they will stop their cart and shut their lights off until you pass. Everything is about making your stay perfect.    It is not a Disney World type of resort with slides but more of a tranquil serenity, reminiscent of a Japanese inspired spa. That said, our 4 teens love it. We make the trip to the Big Island primarily just to stay at Hualalai. It's the one resort in the world where we actually like just hanging out on the property. At most places we just use the hotel as a base to sleep while we sightsee and do adventurers, but at Hualalai, the resort is the attraction. Very relaxing, and great for couples or families.

291919208,40,"Beautiful location with very friendly, attentive staff","My husband and I stayed for a week in an Ocean Front room which was literally steps from the beach. The room was well decorated and spacious, and fitted out with comfortable furniture, a coffee maker, bath/shower, and even a private outdoor shower area. Our room was next to the section of beach where the resort hosts weddings, so we got to watch several - none were intrusive to our stay. Green turtles were frequently resting on the beach outside our room. Quite idyllic really.    The staff were all uniformly cheerful, helpful, and friendly, supplying towels and drinks at the beach and pool areas, offering golf cart rides, and making suggestions. Concierge service was helpful with ideas and maps.    The pool areas were also delightful. My husband enjoyed snorkling in the ""King's Pond"" - guaranteed fish sightings!    The one thing that let the resort down was the restaurants. They weren't terrible, just not up to the standard of the rest of the resort. The Ulu restaurant is a bit more formal. Breakfast is served there. The buffet breakfast is $37 per person. We had it one morning and thought it was a bit overpriced - unless you planned to stuff yourself senseless! A glass of juice costs $7, a coffee press is $12. We tended to eat off the menu, e.g. granola parfait $19, eggs benedict $24. We ate dinner in the Ulu restaurant twice: food ok but nothing spectacular or memorable. Service very good. We tried to get a dinner reservation there a couple of other times but could never get in.    Our first meal was in the Beach Restaurant. Unfortunately I was served raw chicken (an undercooked fried chicken dish). The restaurant manager and wait staff responded in a very professional way, with an apology, substitute food, and giving us the meal for free. They seemed genuinely shocked, so presumably this doesn't happen often!    The Beach rapidly became our preferred restaurant, though it was hard to get a reservation for the times we wanted. The menu was less stodgy than in the Ulu, including pizza and pasta dishes. The Beach Tree caprese starter was really excellent. The pizzas turned out to be surprisingly substantial, and the fish dishes were good. Service was friendly, but a bit spotty. We ate there six times: Once we weren't served water, once our water wasn't refilled, and twice we weren't given a bread basket. On one occasion the server left something off the check, and we had to ask her to add it (and she thought she might have charged it to someone else!). And sometimes there was a little bit too much enthusiasm for clearing plates while the diner was still chewing, or even had a fork poised above the plate!

291607509,50,Fabulous Adult Hotel,"My husband first stayed at the Hualalai during January 2015 and it was wonderful. The hotel is located right on the shore and you can see the gorgeous ocean from each of its three pools (the adult pool, beach tree pool, and the ""kids"" pool). It is a very romantic location and lends itself nicely to relaxing the day away.    The hotel also offers King's pond, which is a swimming pond that is stocked with thousands of fish. The hotel provides its guest with complimentary snorkel gear to use in the pond and in the ocean, which is just steps away. The pond is one of the coolest features of any hotel I've ever been to! It is like swimming in an aquarium.    The adult only pool is not a party atmosphere. It is a quite place to read away from the hustle and bustle of the kids pool. Similarly, while kids are allowed at the beach tree pool, they cannot use floats there nor can they play games or ""be loud."" Thus kids are related to the kids pool. While my husband and I enjoyed this aspect when we visited by ourselves, it was a bit annoying when we traveled there in July 2015 with our 8-year-old son. He wasn't quite old enough to enjoy King's pond, so the trip got boring for him and fast.    On the last day of the trip we purchased a pass at the Hilton up the road to use their pool and water slides for the day at a cost of $160, which allowed 4 people access. For the $160 the Hilton also provided a room to use until 6:00 pm that evening. This was a great way to break up the monotony and my son LOVED the water slides. I highly recommend it, although the Hilton doesn't offer the passes if the hotel is at capacity.    The food is fantastic at the four seasons, but expensive. The restaurant Ulu is located right on the water with amazing sunset views. The food is fresh and the service is spectacular, as one would expect for a four seasons. Their steakhouse also serves fabulous meals but be prepared to pay for it. It overlooks the golf course.    There is free wi-fi in the rooms, but it is slow. You have to pay $25 extra each night to get wi-fi that is faster. We had to pay for the faster wi-fi so my son could download a movie.

For a regular client of the Four Seasons brand I would have expected a bit more. We had booked two rooms in 2 different categories. We had asked if they could keep us close together. We could, at an additional charge, that is. The hotel was not full, they could have just put us nearby without trying to charge extra.    Same with the WiFi. The free WiFi is so slow, that you have no alternative to paying a crazy daily price. I discussed this with management and they do seem to agree.

I don't want to go crazy with superlatives and start gushing like this was the first resort I've been to. Ok, I'll gush. Room was fabulous. It had 3 showers. One of those showers was outside. At my age, this was first time, showering outside like that. Had a bamboo roof and supports for a privacy. It was like showering in the tropics. It had the most complete and best fitness center I have seen in a hotel or a resort! And I loved the cultural center. I go somewhere, I want to know the history of where I'm staying - whenever, wherever possible. There on business trip but it is on the list for me to revisit with my family.

287844309,30,Loses two full stars for insulting adware-driven Internet access,"This is an outstanding property--one of the best beach resorts in the world. It's not perfect, but no resort this size is. Minor problems that come up are excusable.    I won't pile on about the excellent food, excellent service, excellent rooms, and amazing location. The other positive reviews cover this. It's all true.    One service failure that is an absolutely glaring and even ridiculous is the Internet access.    First, you pay extra ($20/day?) for ""fast"" access. For a week's stay here I'm paying an amount that will buy a new economy car (no exaggeration) and yet they charge a petty amount for ""fast"" internet access. Ridiculous.    However, even more ridiculous is the fact that the Internet access you do get for your money is adware-driven, and continuously spams you with an ad bar ever few minutes. It's very annoying, crashes many Internet apps, and is simply inconceivable at this price level.    Every Motel 6 in the world has BETTER Internet access than the Four Seasons, as do virtually every hotel in the world at every price level or several levels lower. It's absolutely bonkers.    Anybody with serious work to be done while they are traveling should reconsider choosing a Four Seasons until they fix this problem--which has been a problem for several years now.",Jul 2015,July 2015,Traveled with family,,"San Francisco, CA"

Turndown service was good, we were left a treat every night, but I recall that on one occasion, we were given mouldy strawberries! The service here was a bit hit and miss.

Katie in the spa was so lovely and would highly recommend her if you are looking for a relaxating massage. We felt so at ease during our extended stay.

285207223,50,40 Done Right!!,"Long story a little bit shorter... All the wonderful things you've read from the other reviews are true, so I'll only go in detail about what was unique to us.... Let me begin by saying this review is long over due being that we visited late July of 2014. It was my husband's 40 birthday and I wanted to do something extra special. My big strong, burly husband had a few health scares earlier in the which he put a lot of things in perspective. It was very important to me to create memories. Forty was such a wonderful milestone that had to be done right. I am in the events/concierge industry and our business is mostly catering to the 1% at their beck and call, whatever they need. So it's very easy to say that I must have tried the FS staff's patience in planning such an important trip. With that said, every interaction was wonderful. Petra suggested that she get the whole lobby staff in cahoots in surprising Jeff. Please understand that my husband and I don't live in a way that even comes close to my clients. I told Jeff that we were stopping in for lunch before moving on to a different hotel. Everyone from the hostess, to our server, to the bellman was in on the surprise. After lunch as we were leaving Nick the bellman asked if we'd like to take a tour so that we may come back in the future. He drove us through the property where Jeff quietly sighed to me and said one day... Finally Nick asked if we'd like to see a room. And when we went in the room a cake was waiting for Jeff! Needless to say Jeff was beyond words and the surprise was a huge success! But that wasn't it... I booked Dinner Under the Stars one evening and it was magic!! Jeff and I are huge fans of the tv show Modern Family. There's an episode where they go to Hawaii. At the end of the show they had a ukulele musician play the song Eye of the Tiger, totally corny but we loved it. FSHualalai is so amazing!!! I sent them a clip of the show and they had Charles the most talented musician reenact that scene. He learned the lyrics and played the music. I could go on forever about all the things that made this trip so special. The extra care and attention Eric paid Jeff making us feel like VIPs, RJ's incredible smile and joy for his work, and Petra taking the extra step to make sure 40 was done right. I feel a great deal of gratitude. Is it pricey yes, but was it worth every penny? Yes! Never have I been to a place where it was an absolute please to spend my money. Our one week their gave us a lifetime of memories. My advice, invest in your memories. PS we've already booked a trip back for October 2015!! Super yay!!",Jul 2015,August 2014,Traveled as a couple,,"Monterey, California"
285097293,40,This Hotel Needs a Refresher,"Hualalai is a beautiful resort. However, given the price (out room last week was $1,300 per night) it is not delivering what it should. The positives: Nice staff, very good restaurants, great breakfast buffet. The not so positives: It is just dated - what seemed like luxury 15 years ago is now common in a lot of homes - the granite and slate throughout just seem tired. And they charge you $25 per day for internet! And it does not work very well (they did remove the charge but at these prices, get a good IT person and make sure it works).    Now the biggest disappointment was the standard of care for the outside men's spa area. I spoke with a manager and a supervisor one day about the trash that was under the bushes. They removed what I pointed out. The next day the trash that I do not point out was still there (yes I did this on purpose). I then pointed out that they need to look everywhere.

282918595,50,Beautiful Hotel and Superior Service Lead to A Wonderful Vacation,"I just came home from a week stay in Hawaii. The first part of my trip was in Maui and on Friday I had the pleasure of checking into the Four Seasons Resort in Kailua- Kona. From the moment my boyfriend and I pulled onto the property until the moment we left we experienced nothing but first class service.  We were welcomed by professional and attentive valets and bellmen. We were then escorted inside by Alexi, who welcomed us with Hawaiian leis, mai-tai's, pineapples, and fresh towels to clean our hands. He went over our stay and showed us many of the restaurants and activities on the property. Another gentleman named Dusty kindly directed us to his golf cart where our bags were waiting for us. He gave us a tour of the grounds and dropped us off at our room. Our room itself was pristine. Everything about it was perfect. The bed was soft, the room was spacious, and the bathroom was just like a spa. To top it off, we had an outdoor shower! Before Dusty left, he filled our ice bucket and water container, and showed us how to work some of the lights and A/C in the room.  Although I could write pages on how amazing this hotel is, I'll just point out some of the highlights of our stay. ALL of the employees are A++++. I've stayed at other five star hotels and I can't say that I've ever been treated better. Down by the adult pool, Eric was very attentive to our needs. Other staff members handed out frozen pineapples and grapes, and around four o'clock they came around with aloe to soothe our skin after a day in the sun.  Our main purpose for going to Hawaii was to attend a friend’s wedding at the Four Seasons. Let me tell you, if you're looking for a gorgeous wedding venue, look no further! The whole wedding was flawless from start to finish. It was classy and elegant, without being over done and gaudy. I can't say enough on how amazing the food was. I'm not a steak eater but WOW, the steak at ULU Ocean Grill was out of this world! My boyfriend is a big fish eater and he's eaten at some of the best fish restaurants in the world and he said he's never eaten fish this well than in Hawaii.  What really set this hotel apart from the others is their attention to detail. My boyfriend left his sunglasses at the Surf Shack while playing ping pong and when he asked the front desk if they found them, not only did they deliver them to the room, they set them down on a sunglass cleaner. Another incident that left us in awe was during the wedding dinner. My boyfriend has a peanut/ nut allergy and during the beginning of the night he mentioned it to one of the servers behind the buffet. Later on that night he went to the other side of the buffet and one of the other servers whom he never met that night asked him if he was the gentleman with a peanut allergy. When my boyfriend said yes, the server pulled out a perfectly cooked piece of fish that was cooked separately from everything else and a side of sauce. Even though nothing on the table had peanuts on it, they wanted to be extra careful not to expose him to any nuts. We couldn't believe how on point they were.  Overall the whole stay was amazing. On the day we were set to fly out we contemplated staying another day, but knew we had our dogs waiting for us at home. Since our plane wasn’t leaving until later on that night the hotel allowed us to stay in our room until 3PM at no charge. They then came and got our bags and held them until it was time for us to leave. They also allowed us to use their spa/ golf facilities to shower and freshen up before we left. We spent the last few hours having a wonderful dinner at the Hualalai Grille. Jackson, the host was so friendly and a pleasure to talk to. After dinner, we spent some time at the bar talking with Jackson and the bartender Michael. Both of them were super sociable and professional. Even though we had checked out of the hotel they treated us like family. We were so sad when it was time to finally pull off the resort. The only downfall is from now on, any hotel we stay at will never be as amazing as the Four Seasons in Hualalai.  If you’re looking to stay here here are some quick tips to help you out:  1. This place is perfect for all ages. There’s a kids club and a family pool. There’s also Kings Pond, where people of all ages can safely snorkel and see fish and other marine life.  2. If you’re staying a long time you might want to take a ride into town and grab some snacks. The food is amazing at the hotel but if you’re there with a big family snacks would be perfect for kids to have in the room.  3. There’s good shampoo and conditioner in the shower so don’t worry about packing it.  4. There are 24 hour complementary washing machines and dryers all around the resort. We didn’t use them but if you don’t want to pack too much, it’s perfect for light packing.  5. There’s sunscreen and after sun lotion at each of the beach/pool huts around the pool areas so don’t worry about packing that either. I think there were SPF 15 and SPF 30.",Jun 2015,June 2015,Traveled with friends,Room 402 has an outdoor shower and overlooks Kings Pond which is quiet.

282136540,50,Four Seasons Quality with Hawaiian Touches,"My Husband and I had the privilage of staying at the Four Seasons Hualalai in May 2015 for 8 nights to celebrate our Babymoon. After much debate in anticipation of the trip, we splurged for the Four Seasons based on reviews and the views from the property. We'd never been to the Big Island together, so this resort ticked all of our boxes for a nice, quiet getaway pre-baby.    Upon check-in we were greated right at the car and had a very easy check-in. They even had a lei, toy, and personalized bib for the baby! We were shown to our room, which was nice, but overlooking the kids pool. After a little debate and our need for some quiet, we worked with the front desk to upgrade our room to a full ocean view near King's Pond. This was by FAR the best decision ever, since the new room was so close to the ocean it was almost too loud to sleep with the door open. This room was exactly what we pictured for our trip and worth every penny. I felt like our room, 912, was perfect... the view and quiet were amazing. The deck was great and we enjoyed sitting out there every chance we got.    The resort itself has so much to offer... plenty of different places to sit and relax... either by one of three pools or several different areas right on the beach. We mostly sat at the beach and found the service to be mostly attentive, except our last day, which was the start of Memorial Day weekend - so glad we left before the big crowds.    During our stay we had breakfast every day at Ulu. The buffet is great, we only wished they did the made-to-order pancakes every day. We had dinner at all three restaurants and room service two nights. All the restaurants were great, didn't have a bad meal, but the views at Beachtree are not to be missed. We enjoyed watching the sunset here nearly every night. So spectaular.    We also had a couple spa treatments and my Husband partook in a round of twilight golf. The spa was very nice, not over the top nice, but we enjoyed our treatments and the service. The golf course is amazing, my Husband was in heaven, and I enjoyed myself riding around in the golf cart. The views cannot be beat.    All in all, I'd say we had excellent service and the facilities are top notch. If you're debating this hotel and another, I'd highly recommend splurging if you can and staying here.

We asked about taxi rides and she called for one. You'd think she would have mentioned that it would cost $100 roundtrip and better to get a rental car. Maybe she gets a cut.    Problem was the food. Average taste. Nothing spectacular. Room service was horrible. Only thing we liked was the sandwich. Ate it anyway because we were hungry and had waited 45 minutes for it. Better food and pricing found OFF the Resort!    After we ordered the evening room service and left the next day early.

There are even separate pools for adults only with a swim up bar that was really wonderful.  It really was so tranquil, very peaceful, relaxing place to enjoy.

280480258,50,One of kind location and hotel experience.,"The Kona Four Seasons is a complete splurge. The grounds are immaculate. Extremely detailed manicured gardens and grounds. The building is very integrated into the Hawaii landscape. It takes a minute to adjust since you expect the hotel to feel like an expensive resort. In fact, it's somewhat low key, but beautiful how it's designed with lava and natural woods. It's also very calm. Not a rocking resort by any means. So, if you are looking for relaxation and moderation, this is the right place. Even though it's kid friendly, we didn't constantly run into kids during our stay. The rooms are spacious, and the bed was magnificent. Very comfortable. Lastly, the pools were awesome. There are several, but both adult pools were fantastic saltwater pools.

280163419,50,Still Perfection,"Just got back from our fifth trip to Hualalai. This is the best, and I mean THE BEST resort in Hawaii. As a local resident, we've tried nearly all of them and none compare to the level of service and amenities at Hualalai. From check in to check out, you are greeted with warmth and smiles from all employees. Special thanks goes to Tony from Manoa for continuing to make us feel special upon arrival, and to Bear on the driving range for his friendliness and personalization of service. Everywhere you go in the resort despite the fact that they are almost always at capacity, you always have the feeling of privacy and that everything is there just for you. I don't know how they do it, but it's awesome!    Hualalai is fantastic in all areas: the pools, the restaurants (Ulu breakfast buffet can't be beat), the rooms, the landscaping, and especially the fitness facilities and spa are all five star. The only thing lacking is a beach near by, but even that is no big deal if you don't mind walking along a paved path for about a half mile along the lava rock coast with the deep blue pacific crashing against the rocks. The cove that provides access to the ocean is worth the walk providing some of the best snorkeling in the islands. Honu (sea turtles) and a myriad of fish in spectacularly clear water await. This trek was my morning routine before breakfast, when the water is calmest. This time I was rewarded on our second morning with a visit from a pod of about 30 spinner dolphins. Bucket list stuff!    Hualalai ain't cheap, but you get what you pay for. Frankly if it weren't for Kama'aina rates, it would be out of our league. But with the local resident rate, it's very do-able, considering The Four Seasons doesn't add on the other stuff like most other resorts. No self-parking or resort fees here.    Every year my wife and I look forward to our get-away to paradise. It is the most relaxing and soul feeding spot on the planet. We'll be back again and again.

Instead of a cookie cutter ""hotel"" vibe it was like we were in our private oasis.    The rooms are bungalow style, and very private. They are done to the nines with gorgeous spa like bathrooms. The views are stunning no matter where on the resort you stay. We got a prime ocean view room on the second floor and it was breathtaking. The pools are clean and pristine, and you don't have to fight for reserving chairs etc. The pool service and drinks are excellent, and no matter which pool you are at you have a great view of the beach.    We loved all of the food here, but lunch was probably our favorite. It was nice to get out of the sun for a break while we ate, and the menu daily did not disappoint. We can't pick a favorite restaurant, but the breakfast buffet is definitely a MUST DO. The donuts were phenomenal as well.    The spa was tranquil and peaceful- I purchased the bamboo face serum and have loved it so far. We didn't leave the resort as we were only there for 3 days and 2 nights, but there is plenty to do for kids as well. There's a rock climbing wall, a basketball court, volleyball, multiple tennis courts, a salt water lagoon with over 5,000 types of fish and snorkeling and many more activities.

That and the expansive beach location (saw a few sea turtles) and many pools to relax (plus the King's Pond with sting ray and nice array of fish to snorkel with). We stayed at another hotel for the earlier part of our trip to use as a base for island/outdoorsy activities (that were all day outings) as we knew once we got to FS, for the price you're paying we definitely wanted to stay & enjoy the resort a little more. The rooms were spacious and comfortable and all seemed to have lanai (recommend ocean view). The food at restaurants were good (Ulu was the best one) but very pricey. I actually prefer eating at the local joints in town (way better poke!) but FS is 30 mins from Kailua or Waimea towns so be prepared to drive a bit if you're looking to get out of the resort.

Prior to our arrival we didn't think it was likely to surpass our stay at Four Seasons Resort Maui at Wailea. While the FS Resort at Wailea is spectacular, the FS Resort at Hualalai is truly exceptional. The design of the resort is stunning as it unfolds along the ocean coast. The nature of Hualalai is serene, intimate, almost surreal.....    Whereas we had requested a room in the Adult/Palm Grove section, we decided to relocate upon check-in to the Beach Tree section as we were intent on having an upper floor Room. We were delighted with our Ocean Front Room as it provided a stunning view, ocean breeze, and we were able to listen to the waves crash as we fell asleep with our lanai door open. As our room was across from the Beach Tree Restaurant, we could enjoy the nightly musical entertainment that took place during each early evening from our lanai. That said, the Beach Tree section was certainly quiet enough; noise was never an issue.    The grounds and multiple pools are beautiful. At night the resort is very romantic with tiki torches illuminating the pathways. The Staff are exceptional as they ensure that all your needs are not only looked after, but are exceeded. Our favourite restaurant was Ulu Ocean Grille. Remarkable location as you dine al fresco adjacent to the ocean for Breakfast or for late Dinner. Incredibly fresh and wonderfully tasting sushi. For lunch we would recommend the Residents Beach House - fantastic little spot!

272890142,50,Virtually perfect,"What more could you ask for?    It starts with the design of this property. It is spread out along the beach and each building of rooms and suits is only two stories. With seven pools as well, you are never too far from a pool or the beach. It's a result of their flawless property design.    The hotel was full while we were there yet we had no trouble getting lounge chairs at the beach, and it never was crowded. Plenty of room. And plenty of room at the adult only /quiet pool as well. As we wanted to relax an adult only pool designated as quiet that was right by the beach loungers could not have been more perfect! And the attendants were great.    The rooms are arranged around the various pools so you'll want to get one closest to your needs. They are very comfortable. Bottom floor bathrooms have an outdoor shower.    If I had to find a negative it would be that the resort could potentially use an additional restaurant when it is full. You are in the middle of nowhere so you are kind of a captive audience. We tied to make dinner reservations for each of the restaurants the day we arrived but couldn't without the concierge calling the restaurants themselves and explaining it was our honeymoon and trying to get us in earlier than 8:30 or 9:00. They did at all but one place. Lunch spots on the resort also get a wait, and don't take reservations. So go early for lunch, and make your dinner plans before you go.

272426732,40,A few disappointments but otherwise great.,"We stayed here for 6nights in May. We've stayed at other Four Season's before and although this one wasn't my favorite one, it's definitely still a very nice resort. The property is beautiful and is close to some nice beaches. The staff are super friendly and kind. we had the partial ocean view villa and to me that was a great option. the villas that were right by the water had little privacy, in my opinion, because there patio was right by the walkway where a lot of people walked by to enjoy the beach. Also, their outside shower was right by the same walkway but ours was in a private area behind our villa where no one could see us. The free wifi is good for checking some websites but youtube videos need a bit of time to load.    Some points I like to make:    1.We had arranged for a car to pick us up at the airport and had specifically asked for a baby carseat. Yet, the car did NOT have one and we had to carry our baby on our lap which is not safe.    2. The check-in was at 3pm but the resort knew that we would be arriving around an hour and a half early but they didn't have our room ready until exactly 3pm. Once we got there, they told us to go have lunch and that the room would be ready at the latest 3pm but hopefully before. It was dissapointing that they couldn't have our room ready closer to the time we arrived especially since we had a child with us.    3. The buggy service is SUPER slow! they don't even really tell you how long it will take for the buggy to get to you. All they say is that it will be here in a few minutes and often times it's much longer than that We waited up to 20mins one time and ended up just walking in the end.    4. The breakfast buffet is very nice! they had a large selection and everything is fresh. I wish they had more warm food options like beans or something but great otherwise. My complaint is that when they gave us the breakfast bill (we had paid for bed & breakfast) there was NOTHING on there about gratuity so we would add it on ourselves. But, when we received our total bill upon checkout we realized that they were charging us $11 per day! They said it was for gratuity but since it was not mentioned on ANY of our bills that they would go ahead and remove it. I know we were reimbursed but I still find it very wrong that they charged us without putting it on the bill. It should have been included!    5. Another thing we noticed during checkout was that they charge you $8 per day for a ""conservation contribution"" which they also DO NOT ask your permission for at all! BUT, if you happen to notice and want it removed they will remove it for you. My husband didn't ask for it to be removed 'cause he felt cheap doing so but I would have absolutely asked them to remove it! it's not even about the money... it's the principle! they hide charges and unless you read carefully you won't know to ask for them to remove it. The right way to do this is to give people the OPTION to pay this money if they're interested up front!    6. Roomservice is SUPER expensive. I will give you an example. We ordered food for the price of $65 but we ended up paying $91 for it. Here is why... They charge a whopping 18% gratuity + $6 delivery charge + tax! Another example was our order of 2 salads (without meat), 2 cups of soup, 1 side of steamed broccoli and 1 side of fries for $100!    7. It's very expensive to order water. We ordered two big bottles of FIJI water (which is the water they had) and it came out to be $33! They have free water by the pool area...I suggest stocking up a bit.    8. We had requested a crib but when we went to our room there was not a crib there.    9. We rented a car for a day which we also asked for a car seat... but the car was given to us without one so we had to ask for it again and they brought us one. I know it's a small thing but for a 5 star resort they should be on top of things and not make their guest wait for every little thing.    10. We had ordered a picnic basket for out day out which was set to be delivered to our room at 9am. It was not delivered so I called room service. They said the basket had been delivered to the concierge by accident. I told them that I will go and pick it up since we were heading out anyway. The concierge said that they didn't have the basket and that it was delivered to our room. so, I go back to the room and it's not there. Then, the concierge says that I was delivered at 8:50am which wasn't true at all because I was sitting in the room waiting for it and called room service who said it was delivered to the wrong place. Anyway, long story short, they couldn't find it so we cancelled it and said we didn't want it. That night I called for a room service dinner and they guy who answered said that he would send me one of the foods I wanted for free to make up for earlier which I thought was nice. When the food was delivered there was nothing for me to sign so they actually comped the entire order which was very nice of them.    11. The resort has 3pool... A family/activity pool, A quiet pool and a 21+ pool. we loved hanging out in the family pool with our baby and watching him hang out with other babies. However, one day, a large group of adults (15+ people) came to our pool ordering alcoholic drinks after alcoholic drinks and being rather loud. It totally killed the vibe of the pool! There's also a small hot tub attached to the family pool where the smaller children would often hang out in when it was windy/cold. The adults I mentioned came over to that pool and completely took over all the space. I asked someone working at the resort about this and they said that the 21+ pool is also a quiet pool because it's close to some residences but they've received the same feedback from other guests and are working to find a solution. I hope they figure something out because it really killed the family vibe of the pool.",May 2015,May 2015,Traveled with family,,"San Diego, California"

271389517,50,Excellent but missing some of the Four Seasons Consistency,"I loved the resort and overall loved the experience!! The arrival at the airport and the hotel were exceptional. We were greeted with a true Four Seasons experience. Mark (the assistant manager) was delightful and sent a special gift and note to our room.    The view and the layout of the resort were truly wonderful and up to the expectations of Four Seasons. I found most of our experience for the 4 days to be delightful and exceptional. However, as a frequent guest at Four Seasons, I noted some disappointments and inconsistencies with the Four Seasons brand. I assume there is a training opportunity for some of the staff members.    I just spent Spring Break at the Four Seasons Aviara Residences a few weeks prior to staying for my second time at the Four Seasons Hualalai. I noted that the staff was very consistent and exceptional and warm at the Aviara location. I didn't experience the same level of consistency at the Hualalai resort.    While none of the staff were problematic, it was obvious that not all of the staff were exceptional. There was an inconsistency in their tone and level of warmth which is not consistent with the Four Seasons. I found more than a handful of service staff and attendants to lack warmth. However, 8 out of 10 were delightful.    I am aware that for an ordinary hotel, that the experience would be considered exceptional. But the Four Seasons is not supposed to be ordinary thus my critique is relative.    I was surprised by some of the small nuances of less than perfect attention to detail such as.  1. We missed turn down service two days in a row because the housekeeping staff arrived between 5:30 and 6:00. We had dinner reservations each night at 6:00 (as I suspect many do). I found it odd that they came so early when most people return to their rooms to freshen up before dinner. The housekeeping staff arrived each day while we were showering so we only took fresh towels. I wish I had asked them to come back. In hindsight, they should have offered to come back since it was so early. I love turn down service and feel like it is one of the special treats I get when I stay at a Four Seasons.    2. At the ""adult only"" pool, on the day we arrived, my friend (we traveled with two other couples) and I were asking many questions about how the pool service worked. The bartenders were nearing the end of their day and while they answered our questions, the experience was mediocre and they didn't ""delight"" us with a warm welcome. They were not welcoming and volunteering insight into how to best enjoy the property. At one point, we said we were trying to understand how to navigate the pool and the rules and one of them commented that the Four Seasons has a lot of rules. I found that to be an odd comment and it put me off. In my experience, the Four Seasons makes every opportunity to make all experiences lovely (even when explaining the rules).    3. The wait staff at the restaurants varied in their level of expertise, warmth and attention to detail. It was a stark contrast from the warmth we had just experienced at a different property in Kauai. Our last night of service at the residence club restaurant was just okay.    4. We spent 2 full days at the quiet pool. Again, while most of our attendants were lovely, there were a few that were bland and inattentive. In addition, we saw Evian spritz just once during two 4-5 hour days. The tastings and experiences such as cleaning the sunglasses were sporadic at best. I can say that the Aviara was much more consistent and friendly in the daily ""special"" experiences and tastings. The Hualalai did not provide the consistency I would have expected. I kept wondering who was in charge and if there were any goals/expectations set for what a successful day should consist of. Our days were generally lovely because of the view, the weather and the quality of the food and drinks. However the special service was inconsistent. There were a few pool attendants/servers that didn't seem friendly at all. When I stayed at the same property years ago, every member of the entire team delighted me and greeted me warmly. It wasn't the same this time.    5. Finally, I found it odd that the Four Seasons doesn't offer any exercise classes without an additional fee. At $800+ a night, it would seem that at least a few general classes should be offered and made available so that most guests can be accommodated. We were there during a slower time period so we were able to leverage the sign up on the day of for the classes. However the whole idea of waking up to stand in line to sign up for a class and pay extra for it, seemed a little off the spirit of Four Seasons. I wonder if there is a way to consider a few classes that are open to a larger group and do not incur an additional fee. While I don't mind paying for specialty classes, the paying combined with the very limited space in some of the classes (6 or 7) seemed off-putting a bit.    I love the Four Seasons and we loved the resort but I was expecting a bit higher quality of experience and more consistent level of attention from the general staff and servers.    I would not rate this hotel as the number resort in North America but I was expecting that I would want to rate it as the number one hotel in North America.",May 2015,May 2015,Traveled as a couple,,"Chicago, Illinois"

We found out there was a group of 200 at the hotel, but we rarely felt it as the resort does an outstanding job of keeping the groups separate from other guests. My only complaint, and it is very, very small....we would spend our days on the lounge chairs on the lawn between the pool area and the beach, however, two days prior to our leaving they were all taken away.

270404900,50,"Hawaii haven for beach, spa and more","This is a really outstanding resort. As I was driving there I thought it may be a bit sparse due to the lava all around but the vegetation and nature around the resort is diverse and wonderful. There is wonderful bird life, lizards and turtles swimming in the sea with you and lying on the beach plus schools of beautiful tropical fish.    The accommodation is excellent especially if you have an ocean view room and balcony and the beds are supremely comfortable. The massive breakfast buffet is at the open Ulu restaurant overlooking the beach. Gorgeous spot to breakfast from. It offers something for everyone and the danger is eating too much. There is even a sueprfood smoothie bar. I did feel there could be more sugar-free and healthy choices in the food but I am sure they will make this happen.    Just about everywhere you choose to eat or drink is in front of the surf. The service is excellent. I enjoyed much of the food at Beach Tree and Ulu but felt they needed more healthy vegetarian and gluten-free options.    The spa was simply superb. The best gyms, pools and classes of any resort I have stayed at and I have stayed at many of the best. There is yoga of different kinds 3 times a day including bikram yoga, pilates, spin, swimming, tennis, creative arts and crafts and so much more for all ages. You can attend a class every hour and design your own personal health retreat. The spa itself features steam rooms, cold pool and sauna and relaxation areas - the steam room needs some attention to have consistent steam and heat. I had an excellent massage with Nikki who removed some of my really tricky knots.    The highlight for me was being able to swim in a protected ocean pool with fish and turtles every day. Probably about 75m long this was truly magic. I will never forget swimming there at sunset on the last day thinking this is heaven on earth!    Highly recommended.

270222512,50,Hotel Of My Dreams,"When someone asks you to close your eyes and think of your happy place, what do you think of? For me it’s the Four Seasons Hualalai, it will forever be my go to heavenly destination!    My husband and I stayed here as part of a corporate event for 5 nights in late October/early November 2014. We really enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend this hotel. Being part of a corporate group didn’t take anything away from our personalized attention but as a guest of this group we were very well taken care of and would recommend this hotel for group events as well as individuals/families on vacation.    Check in was a breeze the staff was more than prepared for a large portion of our group to arrive at once. Our room wasn’t ready yet so we decided to walk around the property and have lunch. The hotel sent a golf cart to retrieve us at lunch when our room was ready – that was a nice touch. On the way from lunch to our room the employee gave us a drive by tour of the property.  We had a room at King’s Pond with an outdoor lava rock shower. I highly recommend the King’s Pond area because it is very quiet and you have a view of the pond as well as the ocean. The outdoor lava rock shower was a great perk, we never showered in the regular shower and took all of our showers out there.    The property is very well maintained and expansive. There is not a crowded feeling at this hotel like you might get at other hotels in Hawaii. We often would sit on the beach chairs that line the ocean that are in front of the King’s Pond and were most of the time the only 2 people there, besides the turtles. Of the many days I sat on that beach only a maximum of 4 other people were on that beach with us. If you are looking for a quiet and peaceful Hawaiian beach vacation, this is where you should go.    The employees at the Four Seasons Hualalai are beyond exemplary. From the house keeping staff to the front desk staff they are all very professional, friendly, and very well trained to do their jobs in the most excellent way. I would like to specifically mention Leon who was part of the wait staff for our event meals – he was always there with whatever we needed before we even needed to ask for it. Also the petite brunette who worked at the salon the early afternoon of 11/1/14- she got me out of a post Halloween would-be hair disaster. There was a bartender that worked at all of our events (R&S/McKibbenEvents) that my husband loved- he was young w dark hair. Also the resort walking tour guide on 10/30/14 she also has dark hair, lived in NY, and also works at the lap pool, she was the most excellent tour guide she really took pride in her job!    Beach Tree Restaurant- One night when we were not with our group we ate at the Beach Tree. This restaurant is open air set right up against the ocean. The beet salad and the Ox Tail Gnocchi were our favorites of the evening. The memory of that meal will forever make my mouth water!    The Hualalai Spa was excellent, I had a massage there and it was very peaceful and a great treat. I really liked that the massage was in an outdoor bamboo hut, the ambiance was awesome! The spa facilities are wonderful and you can access the areas of the spa as a hotel guest.    We really liked that the resort had self-laundering facilities scattered around the property. It was really nice to wash my own clothes and not to bring home dirty laundry.    Because we had a late flight out on our departure we had to check out of our room before we wished to leave the hotel. We arranged to leave our luggage with the bellmen and sit on the beach the rest of the day. They gave us access to the golf club locker room to shower and use of the golf club lockers to store a few things to change into before leaving, that was nice to be able to do. You can also do this same thing at the spa, I would recommend using the spa for this instead of the golf club. I found that the golf club locker room although very nice, was not up to the same high standards of the spa locker room and shower facilities.    What was our favorite part of our stay at Four Seasons Hualalai? My answer to that would be sitting on the beach chairs in front of King’s Pond with the hope of catching up on reading but really just watching the turtles slowly swim around and crawl up on the beach. My husband would say it was the golf, he really enjoyed his time playing the holes on the most beautiful golf course in the world. We have the pictures to prove it! He will never forget that day!

It's not like a lot of other resorts where the main point seems to be shopping. Here, it's about being in a relaxed environment where you can really enjoy the island. Just about everywhere you choose to eat or drink is in front of the surf. The service is stunning. You can take a shower at the spa after you've checked out if you have a late flight.

The canoe club and staff made for an excellent activity central for our family of teens who loved to SUP, snorkel, etc.    The pools are well maintained and Kings pond is great for kids to snorkel and swim with fish and rays. Did a tasting dinner with wine pairing at UULU restaurant which was great and an outstanding value. Staff aims to please - their goal is for you to have a fabulous time and really enjoy your vacation.    Wish there was more options at the Trading post for grab and go. Seemed to run out of selections on busy days. Other restaurant options only 15 minutes away - but reluctantly, you will leave the resort.

This one is beautiful and convenient to the airport. Rooms are clean and functional, food better than expected, and the views are amazing. We are not golfers, but the course looks quite lovely. What is not so great is the lack of sufficient ocean-side seating/lounging. Our family got up and out in the mornings to surf and scuba, only to return around lunch time and have to be on wait lists for beach chairs. We were offered chairs on the pool lawns, with less sun protection, but for upwards of $20,000 for 5 nights/ 2 rooms, I find it unreasonable that I cannot find 2 chairs on the beach to sit. I can sit along side my own pool at home. Even more frustrating is many chairs sitting empty apparently on ""lunch hold"" until 14:30. I overheard other guests having similar problems. This hotel has a shortage of chairs, and an inefficient allocation system. As well, only the restaurant by the pool is open for lunch and at peak hours it has a queue. Doubt I will return and I wouldn't recommend until this very basic issue has been demonstrably improved.

262352926,50,"Idyllic getaway, one of Four Seasons' Best","We recently visited Hawaii and stayed at the 4S in Maui, the Halekulani in Oahu, and this property. Though all three were priced about the same, this was by far the best, and is also one of the best resorts we have been to.    First of all, it feels exotic and special. The property is sprawling, private, and lush. It has several oceanfront pools, a lovely path along the ocean, and golf carts to take you everywhere. At night it is lit by torches. The views are gorgeous, with fine white sand, black lava rocks, and the turquoise waters. They light the waves at night, and it looks like a painting.    The service is warm, friendly, and seems genuine, 4S at its best. We were there over spring break, but it did not feel over-run or crowded, unlike other properties. We never had to wait for anything. The concierge staff were excellent.    There is a lovely golf course, a partially outdoor spa, and a gift shop with wonderful things - worth a special mention it was so well done.    I was shocked to learn the hotel was 18 years old; it looked new to me. We travelled as a family of five and had connecting oceanfront rooms with patios. We overlooked the snorkelling pond and ocean. Fell asleep to the sound of the waves. The rooms are large, very newly decorated (it seemed to me) and pleasant. Bathrooms are oversized and include a private outdoor shower. The closets are walk in and very generous and well laid out; solving my pet peeve of looking at luggage strewn about the room.    We ate at three different on site restaurants, all were very, very good --- and we are foodies and picky. The massages and the spa were great. My husband and son enjoyed the golf course and felt their service was notably outstanding. All of us enjoyed the snorkelling pond; talk about making life easy! The resort had its own snorkel pond stocked with many different colorful species, and an eagle ray you can feed.    The only downside may be the swimming beach. It is very pretty, private (it seems to be accessed only by the 4S guests) and the cabanas are plentiful. But at this part of the island, there is a fair amount of lava rock along the oceanfront and it makes swimming a little less ideal.

261313376,50,The Gold standard,"Now that My wife and I have stayed at The Four seasons Hualalai, every other Hotel we will truly pale by comparison. Yes, it is outrageously expensive. But, if I may, worth every penny. The absolutely, hands-down most amazing, jaw-droppingly beautiful hotel, set in the most idyllic background of the big Island of Hawaii. OK, maybe a little heavy on the hyperbole, but it is really, really, really (thats three really's) good. Everyone was so attentive to my every need that I actually felt uncomfortable about it after a while (we are really more of a Days Inn kind of couple).    To quote Vincent Vega, ""its the little things"". Some small examples......The first day I found a neatly folded shammy cloth in my glasses case, I had not asked for one, housekeeping saw the case and had thoughtfully placed it there. One evening we came back and found a brand new hair brush, still in its wrapping on the bathroom sink. I called the front desk, I thought the housekeeper may have left it there by accident. No. The housekeeper accidentally dropped ours on the floor, so this was repayment.  As for the Hotel...... the grounds look like a botanical garden. Huge protected beach, with live nesting turtles. An inland saltwater pond with 2500 fish including a Manta Ray, free snorkling and feeding the fish. 5 pools. A huge indoor/outdoor gym that would be high end in any major city.    Each room is like a small apartment. Shut the door, and its like living in a closed safe, dead silence. Open the glass doors, sit on the porch and watch the whales breaching the waves off the coast. Unbelievable.    I have two very small negatives. We are probably one of the few couples vacationing on the Big Island who actually enjoy watching TV at night. The selection of channels was just so-so. And The free WIFI internet is for e-mail only, no streaming. Pay extra for that. For those daily rates, Wifi should be all-inclusive, with a much better channel selection on cable. But I stress again, we weren't too bothered by that, its really nitpicking.",Mar 2015,February 2015,Traveled on business,,"Long Island, New York"
260917583,50,Look no Further for an Fabulous Vacation,"This is hands down the best beach hotel I’ve ever been to! I spent 6 days here with my family of 5, and we all agree it was one of our best vacations yet, and we plan to return in the near future. I honestly cannot say enough good things about the resort, the staff, the food, and our experience in general.    On my vacation was myself (18 years old), my sister who is 23, my brother who is 15, and my parents. It was all of our first time to Hawaii and friends of ours had told us that this hotel was the place to go in Hawaii. We took their word for it, and sporadically planned this vacation just a few weeks ago. As a family we enjoy beach vacations, and probably the most important thing to us is easy beach access. We stayed in the Anlekai Suite, which was right on the beach, and had a lovely lawn and private plunge pool right before the sand. It was honestly so relaxing and convenient to step outside of our room and be right on a quiet, peaceful beach. As my family has gotten older, we enjoy peace and quiet for reading and napping, and there was an abundance of those. The property is ingeniously laid out, in that there are a series of ocean front semi-circles that each contains rooms, pools, and restaurants. There is a semi-circle with a children’s pool, a “quiet” pool, a 21-and-over pool, and finally, “King’s Pond”, which was the semi-circle that our room was in, and was a massive saltwater pond full of fish for snorkeling (more on that later!). Each semi-circle had a very different vibe, and they also made a surprisingly large resort feel intimate.    Another thing my family loved was the attentive beach service. We are never really “pool people” as we always prefer to sit on the beach, and everyday the friendly staff would make up our beach chairs early in the morning, offer us chilled fresh fruit, sunglass cleaning, popsicles, frozen drinks, and ice water. Our days mostly consisted of lying on the beach, with a lunch break mid-day, so these beach amenities were marvelous.    Besides beaching, we went on a 2-hour helicopter tour and did a fair amount of snorkeling in King’s Pond. The helicopter tour was truly the best way to see the island, and we had the chance to see volcanoes, lava flow, waterfalls, and whales. In our afternoons, we usually snorkeled in King’s Pond, which boasts over 4,000 different kinds of fish, not to mention a stingray. Our beach chairs were always conveniently a few steps away from the Pond and our room, making our days incredibly relaxing.    And on a final note, the staff was some of the most friendly and attentive we have ever encountered. The concierge service was probably the best we have ever experienced. Our personal concierge, Alyssa, was extremely helpful even before we got to the resort by arranging transportation, and making dinner reservations. We had a lovely experience thanks to her thoughtfulness and friendliness. We hope we can work with her again when we return!    I was genuinely sad as I packed my suitcase, but we hope to be back in the next year or so, so there’s something to look forward to! If you are traveling with children, there were always fun activities going on for them, and if you’re a honeymooner, this resort is about as romantic and peaceful as it gets. There was even a beautiful, small wedding going on when we were there. If you are looking for a dream vacation spot, look no further.

For example, the beach chairs are lined up in tight rows and I was sometimes directly next to another guest. We enjoyed the food, but found that there was really only one restaurant for a relaxing beach dinner. It was very busy nightly and wasn't quite laid back enough for us.

While the resort continues to uphold its tradition of superlative and gracious service, the rental program was a HORRIBLE disappointment and FINANCIAL DISASTER! There was a pest infestation which the management was slow to acknowledge and ultimately ineffective in treating. It ruined our trip, and we ended up leaving the rental house two days early.

259283245,50,"Exceptional service, Four Seasons style","We spent a blissful and relaxing four nights at the Four Seasons last week. From the moment you enter, the staff make you feel welcome and relaxed. Why yes, I would love a fruit spear and a mai tai as we get ourselves registered at the hotel! This is the third Four Seasons we have had the good fortune to visit and by far, the largest resort. When we visited the pools, we thought it was interesting that the adult pool was so much noisier than the kids' pool, most likely due to the bar. However, what you'll find is every pool comes equipped with so many excellent and conscientious servers, you will have ample opportunity, no matter where you are, to order a delicious $16 Lava Flow and not miss a moment of relaxation. After some juggling, we negotiated a room overlooking the King's Pond and while it probably a hassle for the staff, it was entirely worth making the move. For those of you desiring a little peace and quiet, the King's Pond is the hands down the best area of the resort. Being situated by an unheated salt and freshwater pond is the best atmosphere for the fish and sealife that stock King's Pond, but not for any longterm swimming (at least in March). Perfect for a 20 minute snorkel, but a tad brisk for lingering. What also makes it perfectly lovely are the ridiculously friendly staff at the Pond who venture over with regularity to offer ice cream treats or to clean your sunglasses. *That* is the Four Seasons service I have come to admire and enjoy so very much.    So, that was a ton of description about King's Pond and not much about our fantastic room. Well, our room was lovely (#401), with a spectacular bathroom and outdoor shower. Despite being on the ground floor, it felt like we had a larger lanai than second floor rooms (though that's probably not true) and the view was truly beautiful. Nothing like enjoying some coffee and watching the fish jumping around in the pond and their enormous cousins tail slapping in the ocean. We both had relaxing spa treatments--be sure to enjoy a pre or post spa visit in the lovely garden adjacent to the spa. Only one morning was wasted in the gym, but it seemed smart to have different facilities for yoga, weight training equipment and other activities.    The food in the restaurants was excellent--the variety and freshness you would expect from the Big Island. We especially loved having breakfast at the Ulu Grill with the spectacular whale show most mornings. Visiting this time of year is such a treat.    Everyone we interacted with on staff were extremely gracious and went the extra step with a smile.

While it may be the most expensive resort on the island, it is worth noting that they have a complimentary self-parking lot right next to the valet drop off, free internet and do not charge a resort fee.    At checkin, we were informed that we had been given a complimentary upgrade to a suite (so unexpected and such an amazing room) and upon arriving there, we noticed that the entire room had been baby proofed without us asking.

257907895,50,The finest family friendly luxury resort in America,"First let's get the elephant in the room out of the way- The Four Seasons Hualalai is seriously expensive, particularly in the high season. Room rates and restaurant prices will put a hurt on your credit card. Book your stay using a Four Season Preferred Partner, Virtuoso, or AMEX Fine Hotels & Resorts travel agent to gets some benefits, and take some of the sting out of the bill.  Onto the good stuff- everything at this resort is fabulous! The staff are all genuinely friendly and helpful. We arranged most of our activities and dinner reservations with the concierges beforehand, and they were extremely responsive and knowledgable. The bell desk staff, the waitresses, housekeeping, and pool attendants all seemed to be happy to be there and of assistance. The rooms are generously sized, immaculately clean, and well appointed. The bed was very comfortable, and the mattress was not indented at all. The rooms are arranged in crescents around different pools each with their own character. The Seashell is the kid friendly, splash about pool. The Beachtree is more reserved. Palm Grove is adults only with a swim up bar, and King's Pond is a saltwater aquarium you can snorkel in with loads of fish and an eagle ray. Food is of high quality at any of the restaurants. Ulu serves breakfast, and seafood/sushi for dinner. Beach Tree is casual dining and Italian. Hualalai Grill is a steakhouse. All of them were great. Having a drink and watching the sunset at Beach Tree is not to be missed. We played golf which is open to hotel guests only (there is also another course there open only to residents of the resort). While expensive (naturally), was a fun, unrushed experience. Brown Bear, the course ranger, is great with kids. 17th hole is memorable par 3 by the ocean. The only shortcoming is that there was no roving cart with drinks and food. There is also a top notch spa and impressive tennis program. Jogging paths, basketball court, climbing wall, well equipped pool, and lap pool are also present.  The beach is rocky and not very swim able at the resort which is a reason you may want to go off property. There is a Hertz rental agency on site, and even a gas station for just that.  This is a resort where you won't feel the need to go off property although you should because the Big Island is incredible.

257576084,50,It's a Four Seasons! Need I say more?,"Four Seasons are generally over-the-top with respect to accommodations and service. Pricing is outrageously high, but you get what you paid for. We had a well-appointed suite with a beautiful view of the ocean. The resorts layout is designed to provide quiet and a sense of calm. There is a large beachfront with a well tended walkway allowing for pleasant strolls. As is typical on the Big Island, there is very little beach space that is suited for swimming. In response, the Four Seasons has five different pools, None were very crowded during out stay so they were really enjoyable. Our only negative was with housekeeping. Amenities were provided one day and not another. They stored a water filled electric teapot in a cabinet. The water spilled and made a mess when we went to remove it from the cabinet.

257572638,50,Our family vacation at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai was simply glorious!,This is an awesome resort that has a very warm and homey feel for families with children. Especially delighted about the all-day free access to the spa amenities for guests of the hotel even without a service. Big bonus and convenience for having laundry rooms all around the hotel. The Kids Program we hope to take advantage of on our next trip. The pool staff at the Sea Shell pool are simply the best! Always ready to fill-up your water cups with iced water! They even have sunscreen available at the pool area. The hotel grounds is well maintained and all the staff you meet around the grounds are all very friendly. Ulu and Beach Tree House definitely satisfied our appetites. Their wait staff are all very friendly and accommodating with your needs.

257524222,20,When did this property become a Marriott Vacation Club?,"I am so overdue with this review, sorry. I have stayed at this property multiple times over the years, and have stayed many times at other Four Seasons properties. This past 'Festive' season, we stayed here on a two family holiday vacation. Yes, the property is beautiful, but this is the wrong time of year to visit. Want a chair by the pool, good luck unless you wake up early and throw towels over the chairs. Four Seasons sets up additional chairs around the property to help with the crowds. Want a four chairs at 11AM? They put you on a waitlist that is hours long. Incredibly frustrating that we fell to the same bad habits and assimilated by getting to the beach earlier and have one of our party 'protect' our chairs. Lunch wait times are easily over an hour, service poor, food inconsistent. The problem isn't that the staff doesn't care, it is that they are overwhelmed. There are too few servers working extended shifts. I can't explain the food, we ordered lunch apps and entrees that had varying portion size from day to day, and left us laughing sometimes (e.g laughing because they were half the size of the day before).  I am an extensive traveler, stay hundreds of nights per year in hotels in the US and Europe. I don't expect perfection, and would consider myself low maintenance. But from my observations of this property, and from talking to employees, the problem is simple to identify. Go on Google Maps and look at this Four Seasons property with satellite view. Do you see all those homes and condos next to the hotel? Well, during 'Festive' season, they are filled with families, all with rights to use the hotel property (except, I am told, for a window of time at night where they can't make dinner reservations, not sure that is correct). Great for them, but less great if you want a Four Seasons experience. The problem is simple, that property is not large enough to support that many guests which leads to not enough chaises, overly crowded pools and harried restaurants.  We have stayed at other Four Seasons during the holidays, Nevis and Costa Rica are positive examples- but they both have expansive beaches that can support the overflow. And yes, Punta Mita is more like our Hualalai experience- probably because they really only have one desirable sunbathing type pool.  Like every property, Four Seasons charges a significant premium for the holiday season, and the crowds show this doesn't dissuade them from visiting. But, I believe Four Seasons represents more than a location, it represents a certain brand image and experience which should be special. Pay more to get more.    Sorry, we won't be back for Festive season in the future, it is too much a vacation club experience and too much of a hassle.    Thank you to all those who write reviews, my family and I have greatly benefited. I wish I could be better at contributing.",Mar 2015,December 2014,Traveled with family,,"Boston, Massachusetts"

They collect your luggage and whisk you away to the resort. Your check in is done relaxing with a mai tai on a sofa in the beautiful open air lobby. I would encourage you to book a room or suite with an ocean view. We prefer ones with an outdoor shower. It's a relaxing experience. We enjoyed watching the whales directly in front of the hotel. The salon and spa should not be missed. You should definitely utilize the concierge staff before your arrival. They can tell you exact sunset times and which restaurants to get reservations at to watch it, coordinate any special needs you may have, like having a wheelchair ready in your room if needed, book spa, salon or tennis lessons. it makes it stress free once you arrive.

256932775,50,Quiet and Relaxing Luxury,"I wanted to sleep right next to the surf and I got it. I took an ground-floor ocean-front deluxe room (903) in the Kings Pond section. My room has a patio that abuts the walkway at the beach edge. I am perhaps 20 meters frkm the surf. The Ulu restaurant is right next door. I live in my giant covered lanai chair outside my room and in the morning literally tumble into a full wonderful breakfast buffet extravaganza every morning. Maid service is flawless. Seriously, I could stay here the rest of my life. I am leaving in 2 days. I don't wanna! Now look, this cost a pretty good hunk of change. I had to book after a glass of wine to take the plunge into a 1500/day room, but I don't regret it.    A few things to note: there is no night life here. The on-site bars and restaurants close at 10. After that it's room service which I do not like. They will do romantic dinners for two on the beach, grand group functions, etc. But this is a quiet couples' place, not a social/singles place. The food is a B+ quality with lovely attentive service, small portions and big prices - I am not certain you could find fancier anywhere near here, certainly not in Kailua where the restaurants are all beach-bar ambienced, but you can find better portions and more variety other places. The bartenders are great, but of course ghe drinks are pricey - like on a cruuse ship.    I thought the spa was nice - I had my hair done for about 40% more than back home. Not luxury though. A glass of wine would have been nicer than the plastic bottle of water, but the hair came out great and service was very friendly. About like a nice salon anywhere.    I must mention the grounds. The landscaping is off the chart beautiful. I dont know where to begin - it's like living in a perfectly manicured botanical garden. I used to golf but not anymore (I discovered the Zen of golf: go hiking instead), but the course and clubhouse look pristene, there are plenty of carts and the turf looked amazing.    Finally, do not miss the little cultural center where you can learn to speak Hawaiian, play the Ukelele and learn about the culture.

256361685,50,Hula Whoop!,"Well, what can you say about a place that ""gets it right"" consistently? In a phrase- this place works. This praise does not come lightly from me. I tend to be a bit picky in my criticisms. My observations are system based. The flow is here. The attention to specific, some would say minute details of visitor comfort, and the true friendliness of the staff are there.    What exactly is ""right""? On arrival, the reception worked. You or your party will be greeted by your own personal check-in person who will also give you a cool face towel, a fruit juice cocktail and a piece of pineapple- ""so that the name of Hualalai will forever remain sweet on your lips"" 😃. Communication is key at this hotel, with reception staff wearing Secret Service ear plugs and they seemed to be in constant contact with peripheral personnel such as the bell staff.    As would be expected from a five star hotel, the furnishings are impeccible,clean and also show evidence of attention to design for ease of access to the guest and staff. This is the stuff that makes this a destination for the likes of Hollywood stars, top corporate business executives and members of the PGA senior tour,who had just completed a tournament on their championship golf course.    The food, ah, the food- did not have a bad meal at this place. The food was served with good portions, which again strikes a blow against haute cuisine, always a big positive in my book! There are, if memory serves, four restaurants on the premise, catering to varying cuisines such as Hawaiian fusion, Italian and American steakhouse fare. A comment heard on conversation with another couple is that ""I can't believe we're sitting here, the waves breaking on the beach not 50 yards from where we are sitting "" (at the beach bar) and also we were at the same time observing whales breaching and flapping their tails in the distance!    There are three pools on the property, one general adult, one children's pool and one ""quiet pool"", which is another subtle touch in the comfort for those of us that want a little peace away from the more family centered guests. The rooms have comfortable beds, tastefully appointed decor and l artery than usual bathrooms- with separate showers and tubs. Closet space is generous.    Overall, nothing was overtly wrong with my stay. Minor criticisms were an inaccurate outside menu, lacking French onion soup, which I was actually looking forward to ordering. Also, on checkout, the bellman was less than prompt, which may seem trivial, but I was running late for a flight, and four a five star hotel, and the previous experiences with the bell staff, this was a bit suprising as a departure experience.

He was also kind enough to turn a chair or bring fresh iced-water promptly and recommended some of the best possible drinks! The species of fish are incredible in this pool and it also has two eagle rays which you can actually feed! The restaurants are wonderful with my favorite being The Beach Tree featuring steaks and seafood with an Italian flair, a lovely chef, who we met, and a server named Diana who truly aims to please! During one lunch, the whales were plentiful and breaching in the ocean right in front of the restaurant! They put on a spectacular show. Turtles are also plentiful on the beach and the Spa services are lovely. Ulu Bar has great sushi and a beautiful breakfast buffet with delicious made to order omelets courtesy of Dan The Egg Man! Be sure to ask for Tiffany as your breakfast waitress and Cora is a delightful hostess. A truly charming bartender at the Ulu is Genesis who make a great dirty martini and other specialty drinks.

We all had a terrific time. Pool, Beach, Golf, Restaurants and service were really good. The main reason for the average rating is my experience at check out and what I found on my credit card bill when I came back home from the trip. Four Seasons doesn't tell you at check in when they gladly take your credit card that they will be authorizing your card daily based on your spending on the resort. This is their way of making sure you have the ability to pay them at the end of your stay. I don't have an issue with this method of billing provided it is disclosed. What happened at check out is that I was charged the full outstanding balance without a release of the prior authorizations. Therefore the result was about extra $5000 charged to my credit card. No where on my hotel folio at check out did I see these extra charges. When I returned home, I checked my credit card statement and found out about the extra charges. When I called four seasons to try to understand what happened, they were scrambling to provide an explanation. The duty manager told me the extra charges would be reversed in 5 to 7 business days, are you kidding me! Another manager called me back and offered a $200 credit. What a joke for place as classy as Four Seasons. How about just disclosing up front what you intend to do with people's credit card and the reconcile the charges properly at check out.

Given the high price, the service should have been incredible, and it was average (with the exception of people like Jarrod & the valet staff). Dirty glasses were left in our room for days (despite my leaving a not asking to take them away), restaurant staff was impersonal despite our being there for a whole week, and it was difficult to get a reservation for some tours/restaurants we were interested in despite our visiting in low season (this happens, but the concierge at this kind of place should have suggested some options to us upon check-in and encouraged us to make reservations as soon as possible).

253239751,50,Spectacular ocean front stay,"We stayed at this incredible resort the second week in January. From the moment we drove up the bell staff, reception ( complete with leis and marvelous Mai tai in wooden cups) were perfect. The check in (informally done in a sitting area) was seamless. Then we arrived at our prime ocean view room on the Pal Grove Crescent ( preferred for its ""quiet"" pool). The room was delightful with a stunning view of the ocean from the second floor. We prefer to be upstairs even though the lower level room has an outdoor shower. The view and sounds of the surf are unsurpassed. Everything about the stay was exceptional. Each restaurant we tried (Ulu, Beachtree and even rom service) were exemplary. In all the resort deserves its reputation. It is as near perfection as one could expect in Hawaii.

252984853,50,Heaven,"What an amazing hotel. Service is top notch. Almost all rooms have great views of ocean. This seems to be a resort with primarily an older crowd noted, but rooms and resort are in excellent condition.  Pros: Service. Yoga classes at spa. Jogging track. Pools. Views. Amazing stars. Service. Beautiful rooms and bathrooms. Gorgeous grounds. Sitting on balcony with sunset views. Kings pond for snorkeling with many different fish and ray. Service. Golf course views. Every pool was beautiful. Seeing whales from the shore. Beautiful grounds. Bath products were really nice. Laundry facilities included in price and convenient to rooms. Turtle views nightly on beach. Parking was convenient and not an extra charge like some hotels.  Cons: Expensive but very small drinks at pools. The restaurant Ulu was good, but a bit overrated. I got a nail polish change at the spa which was ridiculously expensive for a simple task which was poorly performed. I expected more for the price. Wifi in rooms was a bit slow.  The positives definitely outweigh the negatives at this resort and I would gladly return.",Feb 2015,February 2015,Traveled as a couple,Nice to have a room on second floor with unobstructed view.

252825271,50,Beautiful but pricey,"We just got back from our stay at this Four Seasons and were impressed by the gorgeous property and first class service. We had an ocean view room, which was overall nice, but we could barely see the ocean from our first floor room, as the view was blocked by the huts next to the pool. We'd rather have had a second floor room with a better view rather than the outdoor shower which we barely used. For over $1k per night, the room was a little disappointing.    The food at the resort is good but also expensive. We enjoyed eating poolside the most - everything we tried (poke wrap, pizza, turkey sandwich, onion rings) was really good. Of the restaurants, we enjoyed Beach Tree the most (the guitar spaghetti with lobster and the gnocchi with oxtail ragu were awesome). Also really liked the fish and chips at the Residents Beach House. The breakfast buffet was disappointing and towards the end of our trip, we prefered having light breakfast at the coffee stand behind the general store (they serve smoothies and shaved ice there as well!). Tip: there is usually a gas pump in front of the general store, but it's currently under construction.    The facilities at the resort are great - 3 nice pools (spots at the adult pool and beach tree pool fill up quick). The spa and gym are beautiful. In addition to the Nicklaus golf course, there are tennis courts, a half court basketball court, and an outdoor rock climbing wall. King's pond is a cool salt water pond where you can snorkel (gear is complementary) and contains an eagle ray (sign up at 10A for feedings M-F) as well as a couple puffer fish in addition to the many other colorful species of fish. Even though the beach is a bit rocky, one of the best parts of the resort is the many sea turtles who come up on the sand to rest (don't go near them though - it's illegal to touch them and there's a hefty fine if you're caught). Also going in Jan/Feb is great because you can see a lot of whales breaching from the beach.    Only minor complaint is the location in Hualalai. The good is that it is on the dry side of the island and only 10 min from the Kona airport. The bad is that it's about a 30 min drive south to downtown Kona, although Waikoloa is only 15 min north. It's also a 2 and a half hour drive to the Volcano National Park.    All in all, a great resort although a very expensive one. We'd come back often if it wasn't so pricey, but will probably end up going to other resorts in Hawaii with better value.",Feb 2015,February 2015,Traveled as a couple,"First floor rooms have outdoor showers, while second floor rooms have better views.

252814343,40,Great on a Business Account,"We stayed here Jan 21 thru 24th and we're there for a business trip. The resort is a great place if you want a Hawiian sun vacation or to play golf, but if you want real Hawaii, there are other islands and resorts. Everything here except the ocean front is manufactured....not organically there including their fake lagoon. You can't easily access the ocean here (thus the lagoon) and if you leave the resort, not much of a town vibe close by that's worth leaving for. Food and drinks were good but yes expensive. Rooms are nice but resort has an updated motel feel and hard to swallow the 1000+ night fee. They also checked us into a room with 2 dbl beds...not ok. They did move us but should have realized this wouldn't be acceptable for a married couple. But with that said, if you don't mind the costs, want consistent weather and are a resort person, it's a great get away.

The property itself is 5 stars, service is good, but again, you have to pay a lot more for a ""customized stay"". Dining is very good, expect to spend $50-$150 per person though.    I'd say that you're much better off spending that money on the various snorkeling, wildlife and landscape tours on the big island. They are expensive enough on their own, and far more memorable.

251869000,40,Belated Honeymoon.,"The grounds were simply stunning....just beautiful. Service for the most part was outstanding. Staff seems happy and take pride in what they do. They do pamper you, if you let them. I had issues letting someone fawn over me.    Restaurants were great, pricey but good. 48$ for a piece of fish, 2 shrimp, 2 clams and 3 muscles. No side. Fresh and tasty just ridiculously pricey.    Love the turn down service. They come in each night, tidy up a bit. Bring ice and water. Prepare the bed. Put the reading light and remote by the bed. Till you have had it done you don't know what you are missing. It felt awkward having someone coming into your room to do this. But it's worth it.    However... It is so ridiculously expensive. The room was nice and clean... we just thought for 1000+ a night there would be a little more to the room itself. Great view thou.    Not much is really included in the cost. Most of the on site activities are an additional charge. There are a few child's activities that don't cost extra. Beware the environmental fee for tree planting... an extra 7 dollars a night. We didn't opt out as we support this. And besides, who wants to be the heartless jerk that opts out of that???    The resort put a 7000$ hold on my husbands credit card. So being a Canadian it made it hard to do anything else. Not many places take debit and we did not take any American cash with us. Some well deserving staff missed out on tip because of this. A 7000$ hold would have been good to know about. We knew there would be some sort of hold...But 7000 was crazy.    Be prepared to spend extra... for example. Sunscreen at resort 18 bucks. At Target 10 minutes down the highway the exact same sunscreen was 8 bucks.    We splurged on this resort. It was a belated Honeymoon. In the end we spent too much time off the property to justify the cost. Even if we were on the property more it would have cost an arm and a leg.    In the end, Ill go back when I win the lottery.

251839745,40,Good not great,"The Four Seasons is known for it excellent customer service, extraordinary luxury and for always treating their customers with respect. Perhaps we went into this experience with our expectations set too high - I believe that $1200+ per night, they should be high - the Four Seasons simply did not deliver. I can't tell you how many times we heard ""no"" during our five night stay. From the waiters on the beach ""I'm sorry, its too late to order (by 1 minute?) or ""we can't accommodate that request"" to the landscapers who left cut branches on the path to our room, we simply didn't find the ""can do"" attitude that we found at the Four Seasons in San Francisco that we stayed at on our way to Hawaii. While the property is STUNNING, and the rooms are gorgeous (we had a first floor room with an outdoor shower - a MUST!), the staff simply did not meet the expectations that a Four Seasons hotel should represent.

251822766,50,Absolute Perfection!!!!,"We try to go to the Four Season Resorts Hualalai once a year. First let me say that none of the rooms have a bad view of the ocean.  This year we took our kids and their spouses. We requested that our rooms be situated close to each other. Our request was granted and the kid's rooms were upgraded. I swear that must of had a personality profile of each child because the rooms they were given suited them. One was given a suite that had a telescope in the room. Her one request for this trip is a chance to see the stars. We thought that we would have to do a trek to the summit Mauna Kea, but with the telescope in her room she was happy as a clam. Our other child (who is in his 30s) had an upstairs room. He and his wife were thrilled since she is pregnant and was looking forward to just relaxing and reading.  We finally made a dinner at ULU which I highly recommend. I am not an experimental eater and was sort of leary of trying what was on the menu. I enjoyed every course and every dish. We also did a ""Dinner on the Beach"". It was wonderful and we couldn't ask for a better experience.  The spa is a must. Talk about luxury. WOW!!!  My compliments to management and staff - our last two days were the start of the Mitsubishi Golf Championship at the resort.

Overall, the hotel is very nice, service was good and very consistent with the Four Seasons brand. We hosted a small meeting over three days along with several evening dinner events. Will share the positive and negatives.    First the positives:  - Hotel is very well maintained. Great setting. Beautiful views everywhere.  - Restaurant venues were above average. Great food choices, hand crafted drinks. We liked the Beach Bar area, and Ulu's. Many nights have live entertainment on the beach.  - Did not golf but several clients did - golf course is immaculate.  - Rooms are very well appointed.  - Meeting rooms are of good size (see negative below)  - Staff goes out of there way to accommodate you and they really try hard. Everyone we met was exceptional.    Negatives  - My only negatives surround the meeting issues we encountered. If i were traveling as a party of two for a romantic getaway these would not have been noticed.  - Having hosted 1000+ meetings over 20 years this was the most difficult contracting process i have ever seen. The hotel is very ""rigid"" when it comes to rates, attrition, prepayment etc. I have hosted numerous meetings at other Four Seasons/Carlton/other upscale venues and this was by far the most difficult.  - Room rates are incredibly high for the area. I wished i would have shopped the meeting event and got some competitive rates at very nice venues nearby.  - During our first day the group next to our meeting room was showing movies and 6 to 8 times we had to ask the staff to help them quiet down. The hotel was very accomodating and moved us to the grill overlooking the golf course the next day. Landscaping was suppose to delay until noon but that did not work. full golf course maintenance mode on 18th hole at 9am and it made for a tough 30 minutes of hearing. we were back in our meeting room the last day with no group next door. the hotel did pick up the beverages for our guests due to the issues.  - The hotels standard contract calls for full payment of catering and rooms 90 days out. We were able to negotiate this somewhat however this property had the largest deposits i have ever seen for a group of 30 people (nearly 60k).    All in all i like the property, it is beautiful but if you are hosting a meeting and want to look at some options in the Kona area you can probably balance your meeting needs with rates/contract terms.

Don't miss Ulu restaurant or the Beachtree restaurant. Both offer great service and food. Expect to see plenty of celebrities on the property. The gym,spa, tennis and health facilities are also great. Christmas time is a zoo at this property. The service quality drops off dramatically as does the cordiality of the staff.  If I had to pick on a couple flaws, I would complain about the incessant nickel and diming done at the property, the mediocre pool side service , the 18 dollar kids hot dog, and the lack of beach and pool help to get and set up your pool toys and adventures.

In addition to the great pools and beach, the resort has plenty of daily activities that include fitness, art and cultural activities. There is something for everyone. The resort has a fabulous spa and gym with plenty of equipment (some even outside), classes and a lap pool. We also loved the convenience of having both a general store and a gas station at the resort.  The resort knew we were celebrating our honeymoon and sent us a bottle of champagne upon arrival, and homemade chocolate chip cookies with milk later in the week. The rooms are huge with walk-in closets and the bed was extremely comfortable.

The pool attendants promptly set us up in our loungers, brought us water and other refreshments, and even cleaned our sunglasses. We never had a problem getting a lounge chair/umbrella at the pool, and the beach loungers (for 2) with canopies were plentiful and free. Some resorts charge you for these on the beach.

We also had problems with car the hotel organised to take us to our dolphin experience, he was 15 minutes late and got lost as he didn't know where to go. One of the things I loved about the FS last time was that the pools were heated to a comfortable temp but I think they must be trying to save on heating costs because they were all cold. I did mention this to the reception staff but nothing was done. I saw very few people swimming during our stay so I'm guessing other guests shared my opinion.

247670453,50,A beautiful hotel,"This was our 6th stay at the hotel, and it remains one of the great hotels we've stayed at.    The staff are customer-focused and always there to please. Just ask and they will make it happen. I've written a couple long reviews of the hotel, so I will keep this somewhat short and focus on the stuff that we would like improved.    The hotel itself is in pristine condition. However, the rooms could use some updating as they are starting to show a bit of wear and tear, but that's to be expected. We had a minor a/c issue with our room that was dealt with right away. The new beds are great, so if you don't think you have a new one you should ask for it. (Celeste from housekeeping was kind enough to ask to have our bed replaced after we made a comment). That's the kind of proactive customer service that you get. Just mention something once, and it will be dealt with. The fridge sound at night is a little annoying, but there is a feature that turns it off for 8 hours, just remember to press before you go to bed. We would appreciate a small sofa in the room.    We tried to make Beach Tree Pool our regular hang out but this comes with some challenges. Again, I’ve complained to now the 4th pool manager about the chair policy. This was September, and the hotel wasn't full by any means. But still at 9:00 a.m. there were 15 to 20 chairs being ""saved"" for people who were not in them. Why should these people get the best shaded spots, or best views, etc. September is a challenging month because the Cabana's are too hot to sit in, so outside chairs become a commodity, and those typical people who want the best of everything and are willing to ask for favours. I would never ask for a chair that I wasn't going to sit in right away. The Palm Grove pool is nice, but the chairs are not as comfortable as Beach Tree, and they are closer together.    We dined at the Beach Tree Restaurant every night so of course we love it. What has changed is they have a new chef, but the food remains good, and well-prepared. The restaurant staff are all exceptional and without a doubt the best asset of this hotel. However, what seems different is the staff to customer ratio. They seem somewhat overworked as they now have to ""bus"" their own tables, and from previous visits we can notice a difference. For the prices they are charging for food at this restaurant, they need to improve the overall experience for the customer.    Overall, some minor stuff so please don't hesitate to book this hotel. You will love it. We will hopefully be returning at the end of this year.",Jan 2015,September 2014,Traveled as a couple,,"Toronto, Ontario"

It was crowded during the holiday period so booking spa services, attending exercise classes and dining at our leisure was not as easy this time, but the facilities are amazing. We have stayed at Mauna Lani and Mauna Kea/Hapuna Beach Prince which are all nice resorts on the Big Island as well as Halekulani on Oahu, Kapalua on Maui, The Lodge at Koele and Manele Bay on Lanaii, but Hualalai is simply a cut above them all if you are willing to pay the price. We would recommend staying there at a different time other than the holiday period. For the price you are paying, part of the experience is relaxation and frankly when the resort is jammed, we did not enjoy it as much.",Jan 2015,December 2014,Traveled with family,,North Carolina
247266644,50,Maybe the best hotel I've ever stayed at,"I've been around the world and stayed in luxurious accomodations in many countries and this might take the cake. Flying in to Kona is a bit of a surreal experience with nothing but lava fields as far as you can see, but a short drive north and you enter the oasis of this hotel. The staff and service is the usual high level of a Four Seasons Resort, but the property puts their others to shame (not to knock them either). A stunning beach, gorgeous sunsets, dolphins, turtles, the snorkeling pond, great restaurants, every activity you could imagine, etc. I could literally go on and on and on.    Paddle boarding in the bay with dolphins swimming underneath me was a particular highlight of the trip.    We didn't travel with any children but there were plenty of activities for those that did. I did appreciate, however, the adults only pool and the quiet pool so that those without kids could have quiet time without small children running around.    Only downside to the hotel is the cost, but I consider it money well spent.",Jan 2015,December 2014,Traveled as a couple,,
246888715,50,Paradise for a family trip,"The best family resort I have visited and well worth the money when you factor all the included amenities. My family of four stayed in unit #14 and it faced the Sea Shell Pool. With kids aged 5 and 7, this was a great location to go back and forth from the pool and the room. Our room was on the bottom so it included an outdoor shower and we never heard the guest above us so request a bottom unit for the added perk! Suntan lotion, a selection of books and magazines, and children's pool toys are all included. During the day the pool attendants would bring fruit and freezer pops around to hold you over until the next meal. The King's Pool offered a contained way to snorkel with thousands of fish and a Manta Ray. You could signup to feed the fish and the Manta Ray. Both activities just like their kids club were included in your resort price. My wife and daughter went to a lei making class and also a sea shell necklace class and loved it! Food was outstanding at the Ulu Ocean Grill and you must try the Moonfish. I had the same fish in a bento box a decade earlier at the resort and it tasted just as good the second time! The Hualalai Grille overlooks the golf course and the food was outstanding as well. We just ordered breakfast from room service and they would set up right on our lanai every morning. Hawaii bacon is a must try and I wish we could order it at home! While the beach was small and not the focus of the resort, the multiple pools more than made up for the lack of a large beach. We were able to take one day and loop the island with stops at Volcanoes National Park, Waipio Valley, and Akaka Falls.

Two things (1) If you have never raised children, think twice about putting what Hualalai charges for a room. Hualalai, at least around Christmas, has become a destination resort for couples with young children. The good news is that there is a whole wonderful world here for them to explore. Think Disneyland without the kitsch. The bad news is that the fabulous child oriented venues don't make the kids well behaved.. (2) As much as I admire what Four Seasons has put together here, so much of their value is precisely that you can come here from the airport, never rent a car, and go home without ever seeing the Big Island.

If you've ever had the desire to mix and mingle with Hollywood's elite this is definitely the spot. The grounds are breathtaking and as with most Four Seasons properties the amenities are superb. Loved the spiked smoothies served poolside and also that my sunglasses and iPad were cleaned each night by housekeeping. Also loved the outdoor shower in the suite and the giant sea turtles roaming the property.  My only complaint is that the the service in my opinion was not up to the standards of a five star property - particularly pool and beachside. The process to get a chair poolside was incredibly frustrating and with rooms starting at $1,000 a night I really was surprised to have such trouble securing a chair each day. The staff was very young and they just seemed a bit careless and not well trained. The hotel is also a bit isolated and there's not much within 30 min of the property but at the same time it defeats the purpose of staying at a property like this if you plan on spending little time there.

245140648,50,Exclusive resort on the Big Island,"This was our first visit to the FS Hualalai on the Big Island of Hawaii, but it won't be our last. It's a beautiful sprawling resort situated in an exclusive, gated development about a 10 minute drive from the airport. The grounds are amazing, the rooms fabulous, and the service exceptional.    Location: The hotel sits in Kona which is on the NW side of the Big Island. This is the 'dry' side of the island, so lots of sunny weather - in fact, it never rained at the hotel for the week we were there. For those who have never been to the Big Island, it's much less developed than Maui or Oahu. You're pretty much 15-20 minutes away from anything by car with properties and developments separated by lava fields on the west/south sides and vegetation on the east/north sides. On the one hand, this lends itself to a relaxing vacation doing a whole lot of nothing. On the other hand, any trip out of the hotel is a bit of a time commitment.    The hotel itself sits in a gated community which lends an air of exclusivity. It's 10-15 minutes from the airport, 25 minutes from Kailua-Kona town, 15 minutes from the next major hotel development up the road (Fairmont), and about 2 hours from Hilo and Volcanoes National Park.    Hotel: Absolutely amazing. The hotel sprawls along a long stretch of rocky beach. Except for a small area, the beach is not swimmable (too many lava rock formations), but it is very beautiful.    The buildings and bungalows are all 2 stories maximum with winding sidewalks surrounded by vegetation and gardens. The gardening bill must be astronomical for the place, but you really feel like you're in Hawaii rather than in a generic resort.    There are 4 pool areas. 2 ""quiet"" pools (one of which is adults only with a bar), 1 family pool with tiki huts and plenty of shade, and one ""natural"" pond area stocked with fish for snorkeling. We pretty much parked ourselves at the non-bar quiet pool which has free cabanas for plenty of shade.    Rooms: The rooms are all situated in bungalows which surround the pools. The rooms are huge and very nicely appointed in modern Hawaiian. One of the nicest (possibly THE nicest) room we've ever stayed in. I honestly couldn't find a flaw in the rooms. And the view was absolutely killer (we were upgraded).    Amenities: Free self parking! Free internet.    Spa: I usually don't use spa services, but I do like to hang out at the spa facilities. These were top notch. Hot tub, cold tub, steam room, and dry sauna all situated in a men's (or women's) only outdoor courtyard. Really nice to sit in the hot tub and look at the stars at night.    Service: Pretty much perfect, but I though the service was a little formal and impersonal. More of a personal taste than anything. No flaws I could think of during our entire stay.    Restaurants: 3 restaurants. We tried all of them. Good, but not exceptional food. Prices were actually fairly reasonable for Hawaii (and the FS). There's really no reason to leave the resort for food (had worse food at the Fairmont, frankly, and it was much more expensive).    Value: While the food wasn't to bad, the hotel itself is expensive, Very Expensive. But, frankly, once you get there, you really don't care. Worth every penny.    Annoyances: Just one big one. People save chairs at the poolside, sometimes for HOURS despite hotel policy. The pool attendants won't say a word, which sucks if you get out there a little late since the prime chairs will have been taken. I saw spot literally saved for 4 hours before I saw anyone come out. It's a huge pet peeve for me. FS, ""Follow your policy, will you?""    Tips:  - You need a car  - If you're adults without kids, get a room at either King's Pond or the quiet pools. Conversely, if you're a family with small kids, request a room at the family pool.",Dec 2014,November 2014,Traveled as a couple,,

244829347,40,"Gorgeous property, a few glitches in service","Four Seasons Kona is a beautiful beach-front resort with most rooms featuring full ocean view. The best part about this hotel is their pool selection and the service that their team provides pool side. There is an amazing kiddy pool with sandy bottom, small recliners and cabanas designed just for the little ones and big selection of toys. My son loved that pool. There is also a huge family pool with a waterfall and an adjacent hot tub, a ""quiet pool"", and adult only pool, a beautiful snorkeling area, etc. The service team at the pools and the beach is extremely efficient and personable. They remember your family, your order preferences and seem to appear exactly when you need them without being intrusive. The spa/fittness club is another amazing area of the resort with great service, really good fittness classes to choose from, relaxing massages and beautifully designed relaxation area. I really encourage you to take a class. They are just right for a vacation -- not grueling but defintely make you feel energized (and less guilty about pool-side mimosas). The rooms are what you expect from the Four Seasons: spacious and well decorated. We especially appreciated the extra touches in the rooms designed to greet the little ones. Finally, the food is just OK. The restaurants use high-quality, fresh ingredients but the preparation is very plain and uninspired. I would defintiely recommend the Beach Tree italian restaurant for dinner over the main Ulu (?).    Underneath all of this there are some surpsiring service glitches that you should be aware of. First of all the concierge service and the front desk are not well organized at all. There are quite a few ladies working the concierge desk and they don't seem to communicate well with each other. I had to make multiple calls to arrange for the baby sitting service which was very inconvenient. My credit card number was misplaced, etc. The worst glitch was on the day of our departure. The day prior to the check-out I arranged for the bellman service to pick up our suitcases and the car service to the airport. I also reconfirmed the morning of. Well, neither the bellman nor the driver showed up as the concierge messed up the time. They were able to provide for a hotel shuttle at the last minute and we made our flight but it certainly was a very stressful experience. Finally, as some people noted the restaurant service is spotty. On some nights we had amazing servers. On others, they forgot things and moved slowly.

242582496,40,"Amazing Property, but Suggestions for Areas Needing Improvement","Of course this place in amazing in so many ways. I do think there is some room for improvement however, considering the cost of a stay here...    1.) I was celebrating a milestone birthday and as suggested by many in the travel industry, we did let them know this in advance because most resorts will happily upgrade you. Examples: When I celebrated my mom's 60th bday at a Marriott we were upgraded to the highest floor with an amazing ocean view, and a bottle of champagne waiting. When my brother was married, the Grand Wailea (Maui) upgraded them to an ocean-view suite and their airline bumped them to first class. For another celebration in Paris, the hotel also had chilled champagne, chocolate covered strawberries on a gorgeous silver tray awaiting. Here at FS Hualalai, when they checked us in they said they knew it was a special bday and that they had better rooms available IF we wanted to pay for an upgraded room. (I could see that the hotel had many rooms still available, even advertising a sale online.) I declined, and in the room, there was a single piece of birthday cake and some cookies which I shared with my friend. So this was a very underwhelming experience for such a special bday. My friend is also a Four Seasons Residence Club owner, and you would have thought that would have counted for something...No.    2.) The Beach Tree restaurant was not that great. At 8:43pm, we arrived and the hostess told us we would only be able to sit in the front lounge for the ""bar food"" menu, when we wanted dinner. She said their last seating was at 8:45pm. Sorry, even if we showed up at 9pm, they should have seated us. It was still crowded, yet plenty of tables available. She finally secured ""permission"" for us to have dinner. The server was very low energy, like he was ""done"" for the night. No enthusiasm and below average service. My Mahi Mahi was $42 and served plain - nothing special about it, and next to it, they looked like they dumped 1/2 a bag of plain mixed greens on the plate. If you charge $42 for a small piece of local fish, at least make it interesting and enjoyable.    3.) I went to the spa to book a mani/pedi. They didn't have time for those services that day but they did have an ""express manicure"" available. My nails needed to be done, so I agreed. When I got there, the technician thought I was there for an express mani and pedi. When I get a pedi, I want the whole service and with the express you just get your nails filed and painted (not even the cuticles). So I said I would just get the express mani and try to do a full pedicure when they had time. I signed for my bill for $40+tax, and left a 25% tip of $10.  When we reviewed our bill on the TV the night before checking us out, they billed me for a full manicure at $55+tax+my $10 tip. I knew this was wrong, because believe me, it was a quick express service. I know it was only a $15 difference, but it was the principle. They gave me a receipt that showed $40 yet they went back in the system and changed it to $55. Very suspicious. Called the front desk and they said they would contact the spa since they are a separate entity. They called back and said the spa indicated I had the $55 manicure. A case of ""he said, she said"". Seriously-- a resort like this is going to need proof? Luckily I was able to dig up my receipt that showed the express mani at $40 + the $10 tip. I had to take it to the front desk so they could make a copy and investigate. Funny how quickly the spa changed their tune once I could prove the service with a copy of my receipt. I didn't appreciate this situation and how it was handled--I had to prove what service I had, and I was correct. I wonder how often this happens with the spa, and people just don't catch it on their bill.    Positives: Beautiful property, lovely service - they do turndown service every night. When I worked out in the gym, employees would come in and offer bottles of water, etc. I read reviews about how crowded the pool is with kids. We did not experience that, maybe because it wasn't summer time. Lots of space around the pools, and the employees are very quick to set up a spot either on the beach or by the pool.  The ladies that work in the Cultural Center are wonderful!!! I hope they always keep the center open and continue to offer classes.    So overall, I loved the property and experience, but I did want to voice my concerns and opinions. It's all relative - when you pay what you do at this place (cost of room and incidentals such as two cocktails at the pool for $45, you tend to expect near perfection). Thus, the above experiences I had are just a few areas that they could have done better and I know a property like this values feedback and ways to improve.",Dec 2014,November 2014,Traveled with friends,,"Phoenix, Arizona"

242032789,50,First Time to Stay Here,"We have been to the Big Island many times. We have stayed at various properties, including Mauna Kea, Mauna Lani and Waikaloa (various). I have played all the resort courses except the one at Hualalai. The only way to play this course is to stay at the Four Seasons. Staying at the Four Seasons is not a hardship but it does carry Four Seasons prices. We opted for the 3 day golf and breakfast package for 3 of our 4 days. The package included unlimited golf and breakfast buffet (or dollar equivalent) for 2.  Positives: 1- the staff to guest ratio must be very high. Staff seem to be everywhere and are Four Seasons quality. 2- the location is very near Kona. So..very convenient to airport and Kona area restaurants. 3- the resort is beautiful. 4- King's pond -swim with many fish and a brown spotted ray. 5- the breakfast buffet is amazing. On the weekend, they had a ""pancake bar"" in addition to the omelet station and all the other great items. 6- we got upgraded to a Golf Ocean Suite -awesome room and view.  Negatives: 1- there is no beach where you can swim and snorkel. To get to a really nice beach, rent a car and drive. This is not the Resort's fault, it's just a fact. 2- prices are high but probably not any higher than other Four Seasons where we have stayed.    The golf course is very pretty and is very ""golfer friendly"". The greens are flat and are very easy to putt. The design is nice, with some interesting holes. On the Big Island, I rate Mauna Kea as the best course. The course at Hualalai I rate on a par with the courses at Mauna Lani.    As a final note, we don't often splurge on Four Seasons. Manele Bay is another one. We are probably one of the few that one day - slept at Hualalai, ate the lavish breakfast buffet, hiked to the Capt. Cook monument to snorkel, and then ate dinner at Killer Tacos in Kona. A perfect day for my wife and I.

I didn't do the buffet at U'lu preferring table service but my husband did and he enjoyed it. We cancelled out U'lu reservation one evening after eating there for breakfast a few days and tried the Resident's Beach House. Perfect for our mood, laid back and staff again wonderful. The location is amazing, we walked down the coast and went to a beach and saw sea turtles.

This is how you review a Four Seasons, especially this one. You don't measure it against another property, you measure it against perfection. Some of the stuff I am going to mention WILL sound petty, but I am doing so because in my five (5) previous visits, nothing like this ever happened. My wife has written extensively on Trip Advisor, with glowing reviews and lavish praise, all earned and deserved...until now, so now, I am writing the review.    There is a problem here. If I had to guess, and at this point it's only a guess, I would say the staff is suffering from a major morale problem. Attention to detail is always something prized and expected at a Four Seasons. It's not gone, but it's on the ropes. Again, I know this will sound petty, but there was a cigarette butt (we don't smoke) in the planter outside our room during our entire stay. Obviously not the end of the world, but it really illustrates the other issues. We NEVER saw this type of thing before, period. Bird poop on the sidewalks not cleaned up, never saw this before. Rocks and nuts on the pathways, same. Various litter on other parts of the grounds. Inconsistent valet staff, sometimes they offered water, sometimes not, they left beach towels in the car after an outing. Deferred maintenance in the room: HVAC made a racket (which they fixed with a call), fridge made excessive noise, chipping tiles on the lanai, sticky doors, the center of bed was ""high"" compared to the sides. Dead leaves on vegetation and gas torches that went unlit spilling stinky LP into the air.    Allow me to tell a brief story, it further illustrates what I am trying to convey here. We were walking along one of the paved interior paths, in front of us were three members of the housekeeping staff walking toward us. There was a random nut on the path, two members of the staff walked past it, the third, seeing us, kicked it to the side. AGAIN, what's one lousy nut on the path? In real life it's nothing, but it showed this ""new attitude"" in the staff. The pride of perfection is gone, where it once stood strong.    An error by the pro-shop staff lady (easily avoidable) forced my wife to buy a shirt to comply with course rules. We are HAPPY to follow rules, but because of lack of detail in customer service my wife had to buy a shirt at the last minute rather than just retrieving a compliant top from our luggage.    The Beach Tree restaurant, which used to be so good, we actually scheduled this trip to cover two Fridays. We did this to enjoy the ""Tuscan"" nights which were a huge disappointment this trip. With one exception (Wade I think his name is) the service was spotty, and the food wasn't up to par at any meal there. Medium means warm pink center folks, not cool red center. If Chili's can get the temp right while cooking a steak, a restaurant at the Four Seasons should be able to. No, I didn't send it back, I was starving and frankly too irritated to deal with the inevitable excuses. I did leave a nice big bite (the most egregiously rare) as evidence on the plate. I know hard costs to run this property have to be enormous. That's why they have to charge what they do. BUT, that also means food has to be of a quality commensurate with the price, it wasn't.    Ever been kicked off a public beach? We were. All beaches in Hawaii are legally accessible to the public. Oftentimes resorts have chairs etc. on the beaches, as is the case here. We were all set up to watch the sunset when this poor employee had to come over and ""request"" that a few of us (another couple and a solo person in the same vicinity) move so the pictures of the wedding being held on resort property would not be ruined. I didn't realize there were terms and conditions to my use of the public beach! We did move, out of sympathy for the bride and the guy that had to come over (he knew it was wrong, you could tell). If I would have been a local, I would have saluted them with one finger and stood up with only my shorts on, PhotoShop that out! I can't imagine the cost of that wedding, obviously FAR exceeding what we have or ever will spend at the Four Seasons, but it's NOT MY PROBLEM THAT THERE IS A PUBLIC BEACH NEAR YOUR WEDDING SPOT, PLAN BETTER! The possibility of a bad photo due to this scenario should be explained to potential couples. Or how about this, be proactive starting about 30 minutes ahead of time and very delicately and politely ask people to keep that area clear? How about moving the chairs, so there is even less chance someone will linger there? Again, think ahead so all guests and visitors can enjoy the setting without conflict or impediment. It's a big stretch of beach, it wasn't an issue to move, but it just showed, once again, lack of foresight and attention to detail.    Was there anything up to par this trip? Yes actually, the Hualalai Grille. Michael a waiter, and Shelby the manager were outstanding (like the old days of this resort) and the food was fantastic, without exception. My wife has a severe allergy to soy and peanuts and in the ""before-time"" all the restaurants at the resort were willing and without attitude accommodate this issue. Actually this is one of the primary reasons we have returned to this resort and the Maui property time and time again. The bone-in ribeye is almost worth the flight in and of itself, I am not kidding. Shelby said she called over to the Beachtree (we didn't ask her to do that) with our concerns that we expressed, but since we dined at the Grille or elsewhere, we never interacted with the Beachtree staff after the last inferior meal/experience. Come to think of it, the Beachtree never called our room to address our concerns, maybe they were waiting for us to come back? Again, was this a sign of the apparent apathy that has crept into the staffs' attitude, or were they waiting for us to come back?    Another high spot was the ""cart-girl"" on the golf course. Well the ""cart-girl"" is actually a local guy of ""healthy girth"" like myself lol. He was exceedingly nice and professional, as was the starter, I think his nick-name was ""brown-bear"", both super cool guys.    Why didn't I bring these things up while there? Great question, here's the answer: I am on vacation, I don't want to get into arguments, I don't want to hear excuses, I just want to have fun and complaining ruins that for me, more than the individual issues. I called on the HVAC issue only because the noise was so loud it couldn't be tolerated and there can be fire hazards associated with those systems. I hate to complain about these types of issues anyway. Most can be seen as the ""fault"" of hard working average people, and I hate to bust them out. As I said earlier though, I don't actually think these problems are at the root, a worker problem; it seems systemic since it was so wide spread over many different areas.    I can't emphasize this enough, none of the problems I described matter in real life, but staying at this resort is not real life. This Four Seasons was and still should be perfect. We are not rich people, we are normal hardworking Midwesterners, we do ok, and we save our pennies and miles to stay here. We have experienced this resort at its best, perfection.

Great staff, good food, nice spa, beautiful grounds, and well-appointed rooms. We would definitely stay here again.    Staff - everyone we interacted with was cheerful and more than willing to answer any questions we had (or provide a ride from one area of the resort to another). Very professional, but in a warm and friendly manner - i.e. you felt like you were in Hawaii.    Food - we had the breakfast buffet each morning at 'ULU (portuguese sausage, fresh island fruits, omelettes made your way, etc). We just loved it - frankly, I just plain miss it. We also ate at the Beach Tree restaurant for lunch and dinner, with both meals being quite tasty.    Spa - I did not partake of the spa itself; however, my wife got her hair done and I thought they did a great job. I did use the fitness center, which has way more equipment than I ever expected (seems most of the equipment is fairly new and in great condition, as you would expect).    Grounds -really well taken care of - the property is just beautiful. We spent a lot of time just wandering around, looking at the flora and fauna. The King's Pond is a great little spot for snorkeling if you have time. And take a few minutes to see the turtles that inhabit the coast - we were surprised to see so many!    Rooms - very nice - comfortable bed, nice sitting area, great view from inside and on the lanai. Shower has great water pressure. The quality of the toiletries was great.

240724584,50,A Review from a Returnee Guest. Excellent but...,"Once again had the pleasure of staying at this wonderful resort. It's still definitely the best resort on the coast and arguably, the best 5 diamond resort Hawaii has to offer. The staff are well trained and friendly, they take good care of the rooms and resort. Here's one thing we really didn't like that is new, they have automatically added an 8 dollar fee to each room night that they call a conservation fee. You wouldn't catch it unless you reviewed your bill carefully because no one ever informs you they are going to be charging you that. This is a MAJOR peeve we have with hotels. They should tell you up front if there are going to be unusual charges. So we were told 100 percent of this conservation fee goes to the preservation of Koa trees in Hawaii. Sure hope that's true. They did say could take it off if we wanted, but the point is, they shouldn't put it there first without asking. Also, another peeve we have is when they charge for an upgraded internet connection that is no better than the standard one in speed and only allows you to connect more devices. It's advertised as good for streaming video but it's not. It's a very low rating on a speed test. This may seem like minor issues but for the amount of money they charge, these are issues that should be addressed. Everyone likes to feel they are getting value for their dollar. Also, we think the spa has had a definite decline in service over the past year. The service is perfunctory and in some cases, not meeting their standard. The restaurants are all still fantastic and service standards remain high.",Nov 2014,November 2014,Traveled with friends,"If you need a quiet room, make sure you tell them this when reserving and checking in.","Waimea, Hawaii"

240637832,50,"Hawaii, Even Better","I was ""Lucky"" enough to say at the Four Season's Hualalai Resort recently (Nov. 2014). Even better, we had an ocean side room! The Four Season Resorts are known for impeccable service, magnificent locations and top quality amenities, so luxury is a given. However this resort exceeds all expectations. Our check-in started with friendly valets greeting us by name and making us feel they were expecting us, and actually happy to see us!! Immediately we were shown to a very lovely large open air tropical living room (hard to call this room a lobby), where we were seated on a cozy couched sitting area, welcomed with drinks, rolled towels while our associate finalized our stay details.  We were early (anticipating this wonderful stay), but made to feel this was absolutely not an issue and we were welcome to take full advantage of the resort, and we would be called as soon as our room was ready. Everything from the moment we arrived was simply stellar. We were made to feel like we were special guests, everyone smiles and says “Aloha”, and if you appear to need help, they are there to answer any questions.  Our room was lovely, great size, spotlessly clean, and extremely comfortable. We could keep the room cool with air-conditioning or open the sliding doors to hear the crash of waves, and call of tropical birds.  Dinner and breakfast was just as perfect as the entire resort. Breakfast was a mesmerizing brunch with endless choices, either traditional or innovative. Dinner was just as awesome. Ocean-side, candle lit, and we felt as if we could stay all night, and someone would be there to respond to our every desire.  The location is spectacular, but hey it’s Hawaii!! To be honest the higher than average cost of a resort like this is not for everyone. We don’t typically don’t stay at this high caliber hotel, in the past we’ve not budgeted for it, assuming our money was better spend elsewhere. But during this trip we were easily convinced this resort is well worth it. Becoming truly relaxed and feeling all stress vanish is a very important part of a vacation. So if you find yourself on the Big Island of Hawaii, a resort like this can only enhance what is a very splendid and extraordinary place.

The beach area has a very child friendly swimming area.  King's Pond is not to be missed.  The rooms are very nice- large, well appointed and the outdoor shower is a nice touch.  The Beach Tree restaurant is wonderful, we ate dinner there almost every night.  Very nice pool with many cabanas and chairs.    The only thing that kept the resort from being perfect was that every day when you arrived at the beach the staff asked for your name. I understand that all beaches in Hawaii are public and they wanted to make sure that only guests were using the facilities, but we stayed there for 10 nights. After the second day I expect a hotel of this caliber to greet me by name. Next time I stay I will bring ""Hello My Name Is..."" tags for my family to wear.    Also, the golf course rooms are very far from the beach/resort/pool.

240596784,50,Fantastic venue and service.,"We made a return visit to this property having visited four years ago. This visit was equally enjoyable and if anything, the service even more over the top. Adding a few comments to the many superlative recent reviews:  1. The base Internet service (which we found to be more than adequate) is free. There is an upcharge option for those who want to stream video, etc.  2. The Saturday evening outdoor dinner buffet has been discontinued in favor of a ""chef's table"" event targeting locavore cuisine and designer cocktail hour. That was a minor negative, as we enjoyed the spectacular assortment of appetizers, entrees and general atmosphere.  3. The Hualalai Grille, which features primarily an a la carte steakhouse menu with some seafood options, was our favorite dining venue. Unfortunately they are closed on Tuesday evenings so we missed out on a repeat visit.  4, For those folks who want an espresso drink in the morning, a smoothie later on or a less expensive option for breakfast or lunch, try the Hualalai Coffee Company around the corner from the general store. This is part of the resort, and has a great assortment of morning pastries, hot sandwiches, wraps and the like. Note they are only open till 2 pm.  4. For a less expensive casual dining option, walk to the Residents Beach House which is also part of the resort. Their lunch menu in particular has good sandwich and salad options. Unfortunately, as is the case with the Beach Tree restaurant, the dinner menu switches to more formal entrées and the main casual options are a few salads, a burger, or pizza in both venues. Staff do their best to accommodate special requests.  5. The Beach Tree is quite popular for happy hour, etc. We found their dinner menu virtually unchanged from four years ago. If you like Italian and Mediterranean cuisine in particular, you'll love both (4) and (5). Otherwise the selections tend to be repetitive between venues. Room service has the best ""American"" type dining options and we wish there would be more of these selections available elsewhere.  6. The toiletries have changed from the wonderful L'Occitane products to a local ""organic"" provider. No comparison in quality. We'll remember to bring our own next time.  7. There's a great ""quiet pool"" location with shaded cabanas and plenty of ocean-side seating as well. The staff is amazing and will make you feel very pampered!

The hotel, the staff, and the guests are all impeccable. We had privacy, service, and beautiful weather every day. To make up for our late arrival from New York and the hefty price tag, we decided to stay at a hotel right outside the airport the night we landed- less than $100- and when we awoke the next day we headed to Roy's for a great breakfast and then on to the Four Seasons. Our room was not ready until later in the afternoon but we had lounge wear at the ready and they let us change and use the facilities right away. The cocktails are great, food is expensive but when you are paying this much nightly a $24 hamburger goes along with it. The sushi at the restaurant (can't remember which) was beyond fresh and amazing- we ate there 2 night. We also ate at the steak house and the filthy martini was perfectly served. We headed over to the beach front restaurant at Brown's Beach House at the Fairmont and had a great meal with perfect sunset (like a $50 taxi).

239405529,30,Room for Improvement,"Just checked out and have very mixed feelings regarding this property. Positives are that the resort and location are spectacularly beautiful, and rooms are modern and well maintained. But overall, we encountered a number of hiccups in service that left us with a sour taste in our mouths, given the sky-high rate we paid. To begin with, I am almost seven months pregnant and had requested hypo-allergenic bedding along with extra pillows for support prior to our stay (and in fact re-confirmed this request on 3 different occasions). Despite this, our room was not de feathered (which we suspected after waking up with red, severely watery eyes) and no extra pillows were provided. The housekeeper confirmed the next day that the pillows were feather and not foam, but no explanation was provided. I again asked for the room to be de-feathered and for extra pillows to be provided. Hours later, 2 foam pillows were brought to our room and the original 4 feather pillows were left on the bed. Housekeeper claimed that all of the pillows were foam, but he didn't bother to check himself and what he said was quite obviously untrue given that (1) the foam pillows felt entirely different and (2) we had an immediate allergic reaction to the feather pillows. At this point, we were sick of dealing with the issue and just slept uncomfortably through the night rather than try to deal again with an issue that the housekeeping staff seemed entirely incapable of addressing. The front desk did give us a $100 credit when we mentioned this issue at checkout, but that is little recompense for poor sleep when you are paying $1200 per night. We stayed at the St. Regis in Kauai immediately before coming to the Big Island and they had absolutely no issue accommodating the same request, at a much more reasonable rate per night.    Other issues: we asked in room dining to retrieve our dishes after 12 when we were going to check out on our last day. Despite agreeing, they still showed up at 10 a.m. and let themselves into our room with their key while we were getting ready. Also, no turndown service, which is standard in resorts of this caliber. Dinner at Ulu restaurant was terrible. Could get a better Thai meal for $8 at any takeout place in Chicago. Poor communication from front desk staff regarding what was included in our resort package (hotel tried to charge us for breakfast items that we were never told were not included in our package, which ostensibly included breakfast with no restrictions, but they removed the charge when we complained about the lack of prior notice at checkout). Valet staff confused and inexplicably brought wrong car around, claiming that the car was ""under the wrong name"" and insisting that the white minivan that they brought was ours. Inexplicable given than we told them that we had a black SUV, which turned out to have been under our name the entire time. Finally, we asked for late checkout the day we left. Resort was entirely unwilling to accommodate the request by even a few hours despite the fact that it was low season claiming that someone was checking into the room later that day (I highly doubt that every room of our type was full given that the resort was generally empty).    Overall, the level of service provided fell far short of what we have experienced at other Four Seasons. This resort is not even in the same class as resorts in Asia such as Four Seasons Bali, and frankly was not as good as many other high end but still less expensive resorts in North America such as St Regis Kauai, Rosewood Mayakoba or Sugar Beach St Lucia. Again, it would be one thing if we were talking about a Sheraton, but at the prices charged at this property, the service should be seamless.

238509218,50,Third trip to Hawaii but first time to Big Island - WHY did we wait so long?,"We love the Four Seasons in Maui but we decided on our third trip to Hawaii to try a new island. First, the beauty of the Big Island is breathtaking. It is a wonderful adventure seeing how different and distinct each of the Hawaiian islands are. Second, the Four Seasons Hualalai does not disappoint. It's 33 acres of well kept grounds, awesome beach-scapes and luxurious pools. My new happy place is the Beach Tree Pool. It's so fantastic that I feel a bit childish going on and on about it but I love it. The cabanas are nicely spaced so you're not right on top of the other bathing beauties. The gorgeous green terraced grass and view of the ocean are outstanding. We enjoyed dining at all the restaurants on the grounds and by the pool. Lastly, all the food was good and service was what you expect from the Four Seasons. Danielle and Jonathan were stand-outs for their top-notch personal service during our dinner at Hualalai Grille. The jogging path was a great way to explore the resort/island and also work off all of that delicious food. We enjoyed breakfasts at Ulu and the friendly staff, especially Cora. The natural beauty of the setting (have you ever seen so many stars just walking along the beach!?) and how well the Four Seasons does just about everything means we definitely have found a resort we will return to time and time again. PS The one thing that I didn't LOVE was the lighting in the bathroom (it may be sponsored by a plastic surgeon) but come on who is going on vacation for good bathroom lighting?",Nov 2014,October 2014,Traveled as a couple,,"Cincinnati, Ohio"
238310871,50,Third Visit Proves Hualalai Improves with Age,"I first visited Hualalai shortly after the initial opening and it was amazing at that time. A second visit a few years later proved an equally satisfying experience in a rather primitive area on the Big Island. We opted for Hualalai for our recent October Honeymoon and after nearly ten years, this resort continues to fit like a glove meeting and exceeding expectations in all areas of food, service, resort amenities, spa and I'll say again, service! The service is best described at 'intuitive', something this Southern boy is quite used to when my host wants to ensure I'm satisfied.    I'm a very picky, seasoned traveler, but unlike most reviewers here, I do adjust my expectations commensurate with the property/resort I visit and my reviews reflect this. When I'm at a Hyatt or Marriott Resort, I expect 3-4 stars. When I'm in a business hotel, I expect 3 stars. However, when I'm at a Four Seasons, I expect 5-6 stars and I can say this particular Four Seasons continues to be on-point and delivers 5-6 stars. And, I'm happy to pay for 5-6 stars when I know I'll get what I want.    This resort is pricey by lesser comparisons, but Hualalai is a treat, so avoid the sticker shock, adjust your expectations and know that you will get the product you are paying for. One thing to note, you will not be nickel and dimed at Hualalai with things like spa entry fees, resort fees, cabana rentals, ice tea refills at the pool etc....These things add up quickly, so factor these additional costs and know many of these things are included in your rate. Having been to almost all premiere hotels in Hawaii, I find the food/drink costs at Hualalai on par and not terribly excessive. Resort food/drink cost in Hawaii is just high. If you expect to pay 50 bucks for breakfast per person, you won't fight it when your actually paying 50 bucks for eggs and bacon and 20 bucks for a martini....(I was at the Ritz Carlton Cancun and a margarita was 28 bucks...that is offensive and even more so because it was Mexico).    Room Tip: If you want privacy, request a room away from the pool areas. Do not be afraid to book a golfcourse/oceanview room...In my opinion, these are some of the best rooms at Hualalai. I prefer the top floor rooms, but bottom floor rooms feature outdoor showers which is kind of cool. *The rooms are being renovated in 2015, so the current rooms are showing their age, but are not thread-worn, just the original decor from their initial opening in 1996. To me the decor speaks to Hualalai style, so I hope they don't alter the vibe too much.    If you are looking for a special place and want a treat, you will not find any faults with Hualalai. Pardon the cliche, but this property continues to age like a fine wine and best thing is, you can keep going back to this vintage.",Nov 2014,October 2014,Traveled as a couple,I like golfcourse oceanview rooms for privacy,Austin

From the moment we walked in the room and saw the incredible ocean view to the exceptional staff, we were impressed. We were fortunate enough to have a beach front room that had a large lanai and siesta canopy daybed which was great for star gazing after the sun went down. The outdoor shower was simply beautiful. Concierge and bell service staff exceeded our needs and expectations making us feel like we were one of the only guests at the almost sold out hotel. One thing we would do different is NOT reserve a daybed at the pool. When we were planning our trip, on a recommendation from the hotel, we booked a daybed for two different days at $300 each day, not realizing they were not actually in a pool area but outside of the pool fence. We had to walk across the grass, up the sidewalk and into the pool area if we wanted to take a dip in the water. We are already looking forward to our next trip to this amazing hotel and island!",Nov 2014,October 2014,Traveled as a couple,,"Ankeny, Iowa"
237688577,50,"Five stars isn't enough, this property takes service and luxury to another level.","First let me say something about myself so you as readers will have a little context. I'm a physician in my mid forties, highly active and adventurous (this is sounding like a match.com profile- sorry), and I've traveled extensively worldwide both on business and pleasure over the past twenty + years. I've stayed in $1.50 a night shacks in SE Asia and 5 star plus properties so I have a decent idea of what's out there. This is the fourth Four Seasons property I've experienced, the others being Las Vegas, Nevis (Caribbean), and Lana'i.    Usually when I travel I'm not overly concerned with my accommodations, I just need a clean bed and a shower as I tend spend most of my time off property looking for interesting things to do and see wherever I am. This trip was a little different, it was my honeymoon so I wanted someplace where we could relax and feel pampered. We ended up staying at the Mauna Lani for four nights (on a recommendation from a friend) and the Four Seasons for two. The Mauna Lani was nice enough, the Four Seasons was incredible.    Neither were cheap, the Four Seasons was about $100 more per night (kama'aina rates for Hawaii residents) but we also received a $75 breakfast credit each day at the Four Seasons for the world class buffet at Ulu and we were upgraded to an incredible oceanfront room. There was a bottle of Moet & Chandon on ice in our room when we arrived with a handwritten note of congratulations for us. Handwritten!    Here are a few observations to give you an idea of the caliber of this property. As you would expect there was attention to detail everywhere but these are a few things that really struck me. Much of the staff accesses different areas of the property by golf cart. If you happen to be walking along a path after dark and a golf cart approaches, the staff member will pull off to the side and turn off his headlights. No joke. Everybody does it. Sounds like a small thing I know but this is the level of attention to detail at this property. Next there was a big culinary event going on the weekend we were there, chefs from around the globe were on property and on Saturday night the big finale event was being held at Ulu, the Asian/seafood/sushi restaurant. I called Saturday morning to see if there was availability and was told the event was completely booked. Understandable. Later that evening when we had returned from a day of diving I called to make reservations at another restaurant, I expressed my disappointment that we'd miss a dinner at Ulu and the concierge asked me to hold on. She came back on the line and said they had made an exception and would squeeze us into the event. The dinner was one of the top five meals I've had in my life. I had local wild boar chops and pork belly, my wife had grilled scallops. Both were prepared to perfection.    I feel like I could go on and on about the Four Seasons, it was without a doubt the best resort experience I've ever had. Hands down. We were both so impressed with everything and everyone we came into contact with and were incredibly sad to leave. We'll be back for sure.",Nov 2014,October 2014,Traveled as a couple,Every room is incredible.,"Kauai, Hawaii"

Right on check in we were upgraded from the golf course view room I had booked to a lovely quiet and private ocean view room at King's Pond.

The property is vast and it seemed that each day we would discover a new part that we had not seen before. There are so many perfect photo opportunties that you don't know where to start. The ""adult"" pool is one of the most beautiful I have ever seen. There is also a quiet pool with a swim up bar which is divine. The main restaurant is completely open air (as is most everything) and it literally feels like you are eating on the beach. The food is great and the atmosphere is over the top awesome. I loved this place. Sometimes eating in an open air concept can be too hot but not here - it was perfect. When we first check in (we had 2 rooms) we were not satisfied. We were given rooms in the ""older"" part of the resort and we felt like we were in a basement. We were moved to new rooms that overlook a man made ""ocean"" filled with living sea creatures that you can snorkel in. These rooms were PERFECT. I would recommend you get rooms in the newer buildings or get a suite with a private plunge pool (which we will do next time) as they look incredible. The staff is great, the location is not too far from the airport but far enough that you don't know the airport is nearby. The concierge was amazing and we did some of the most exciting and memorable day and night excusrions of any vacation I have ever been on. You must go to the observatory at night and see the rings of Saturn - words can't describe.

The layout is gorgeous- super spread out and roomy; it never feels crowded. Impeccable grounds. I never saw any trash, and they must have ridiculous pest control, because I literally did not see one single bug in the 5 days I was there. Housekeeping was super thorough- they even folded our laundry! Oh, and there is a laundry service available for a fee, but they also have a washer and dryer available for every couple of rooms to use for no charge (detergent and softener complimentary). The pools are gorgeous, and not too cold, as some pools on the islands are kept. The pool staff is so attentive! They get you set up with [super comfy] chairs and chair covers the minute you walk into the pool or beach area. And prepare to be spoiled rotten- they come by and offer sunglasses cleaning, Evian mist, frozen pineapple, chilled aloe vera gel, fresh fruit kabobs, otter pops, and of course ice water. There is sunblock at each pool, complimentary snorkel gear and even water shoes available to use for the day, free of charge. The spa is amazing (see my review on the official Four Seasons Hualalai spa TA page). The snorkel pond is awesome. Every fish you could hope to see while snorkeling in the ocean in Kona, plus a spotted eagle ray that you can even feed! (Check the weekly activities schedule when you get to the hotel for feeding times). The food was great everywhere. Concierge was super helpful and knowledgeable. Most of all, the customer service was spectacular. Every single employee, from the landscapers to the housekeepers to the kid's club staff greets you with a warm ""aloha"" or ""good morning"" or ""can I help you with anything"" when they walk by.

Everything was absolutely perfect for our entire stay. After we left this hotel, we moved on to the St Regis Princeville, and my husband, who is not known to be all that concerned about the relative fanciness of hotels, declared that he had Four Seasons homesickness when we checked in.    The room is perfect- large, with a great lanai space. The bathroom is massive, with a wonderful shower. I really appreciated the onsite laundry- even though we were only there a few days, its always nice to not have a suitcase full of dirty luggage. This is especially true if you are moving on to another resort during your stay.    I started every morning with a group fitness class- while I did find the $20 fee somewhat ridiculous, the classes were actually really good and worthwhile. Our rate included the Ulu breakfast buffet, which is probably the only buffet I've ever encountered that might actually be worth the $37 they charge. I am gluten intolerant (yes, I know) and they even had a special gluten free section with gluten free pastries that were actually quite delicious.    We spent our days at the quiet pool. I was impressed with the fact that the staff actually seemed concerned about keeping the pool quiet- sometimes the ""quiet pool"" distinction is pointless. The food was delicious, and the poolside service was perfect. Every time you put your glass down it was refilled. When you arrived at the pool, before you could even ask, someone was there to set up your chairs.    We dined at all three restaurants on property and each meal was incredible. I had posted several photos to instagram during my stay, and on the last night at Ulu, our waiter delivered a note thanking me for sharing my photo and offering us free drinks.

They really think of everything here and you need to show up with very little of the extras. For example, they have sunscreen and aloe at the pools, they clean your sunglasses, charge your iphone. It's luxury at its best -- where it's actually not in your face. The resort blends in with the surroundings and doesn't feel 'fancy'. I also loved that the resort feel compact, not cramped, but you could get to any area very quickly as there were nooks tucked away so everything seemed private, but wasn't far. We loved the buffet breakfast at Ulu, great view and service, and ordering off the menu was good as well. Not cheap, but don't expect anything to be cheap here. We dined multiple times at the Beach Tree and were always happy with the food, poolside dining was great as well. They split the plates without asking and bring nice trays so it's not awkward to eat while laying on a lounge chair. We stayed in an oceanfront room and it was totally worth it. Would get 903 again if we could. Great location and view, big room, outdoor shower. There were a few minor upgrades I suggested to them about the rooms in general but overall, we were very happy. The concierge was really helpful, both before and during our stay. I enjoyed my facial and the spa is very relaxing with a river you can walk in to massage your feet, plus a section with all the typical stuff - plunge pool, sauna, steam, etc. We were able to rent a car for the day there and it couldn't be easier. Sign a few spots, then the car and keys are waiting for you in valet. When you come back, you just drop off with them, and that's that. There's a gas station on property as well to fill up. We usually like to stop at a store before heading to a resort to get all the basics (sunscreen - we only do carryon - snacks, water, etc). We didn't need to do that at all. They keep refilling water at the pool, have water in the room, sunscreen at the spa and pool, etc. I felt very taken care of wherever I was. There were two very minor instances were service didn't feel 5-star, and I shared these with the resort directly. A bit of a miscommunication, but if it had happened anywhere else, I wouldn't have thought anything of it, but as my expectations were so high, it was worth bringing up. At the end of the day, it's obviously not cheap to stay here but I can't imagine you'd be disappointed. Great service, accommodations, food, amenities, beautiful (but small) beach, great pools.

234156386,50,2nd Time Here Even Better,"We were here 3 years ago and had a fantastic experience. I was worried that the experience wouldn't live up to my memories, but it absolutely did. Some things have changed (the Beach Tree is mostly gone), but is still in my mind one of the best 10 resorts on the planet.    When we arrived, our room had several beautiful treats and gifts for us and our 3 year old daughter. The rooms are absolutely beautiful with wonderful decor to match the views.    The service is fantastic across every part of the resort. The pools are absolutely stunning, with a different cocktail menu at each. Most of all, we just loved sitting around at Beach Tree bar at night, watching the sunset, and listening to live hawaiian music and watching the traditional dancers. There is a beautiful grass area where kids would play.    Pros:  - Absolutely stunning location, property, pools, landscaping and gardening  - Incredible service  - Food and drinks were amazing  - Fantastic concierge helped plan all of our activities with ease    Cons:  - Very expensive  - ?

233709207,20,Multiple issues.Hidden fees.Wasn't worth the cost.,"Overall we enjoyed the trip but need to bring the following to your attention:    I traveled with my toddler and mother 09/07-09/17. On arrival, we were given room 1910 on the second floor making access difficult given I need to carry my toddler and a stroller up and down many times a day.    That night we found out the room was facing a loud restaurant with live music at night. Needless to say my baby could not sleep and cried all night. I don’t understand why we were placed in such a room while the resort appeared empty.    The next morning, we requested another room and paid to upgrade to a suite on the ground floor. However to our disappointment the fan in the shower was not working maintenance staff were in and out of the room for many hours. I would have assumed that the suite would have been checked prior to our move in.    The service and the quality of food by the kids' pool was poor. After ordering a simple pasta with butter for my toddler on 09/10 at around 4 pm and instructed it needed to be overlooked as she has no teeth yet, it arrived 30 min later completely undercooked. It took them another 30 minutes to get it done right. And no apology was ever given.    When I ordered tuna sashimi I was told that the chef who is working today doesn't know how to prepare it. I am surprised that this happened.    We were also charged at the Beach Tree restaurant for my toddler’s meal which should have been complimentary and hassle free. The bill was adjusted after my request.    At the shower by the beach tree restaurant I saw multiple cigarette stubs and plastic glass in the bushes right by the public shower. The hotel staff were walking by without noticing some of them were on their cell phones. I have photos I can send if needed.    On Tuesday September 9th we were approached by a lady at the kids pool who offered for us to take a toddler swim class. We agreed and enjoyed that. Later however I found out that we were billed for that class by the spa. Was the teacher employed by the hotel and instructed to bill us without disclosing any costs?    Room service: every time we ordered room service at night and specifically requested to knock on delivery because the baby is sleeping they still rang the door. All despite the sign ""do not disturb"" on the door.    The rooms need to be remodeled. In order to be able to sleep on the couch in the living room, a thick wooden board needed to be placed under the thin mattress. The sleeper couch mechanism was so old that every time you move it was noisy.  The walls in our room were so thin we can hear every cough, toilet flush, step, water drop, anything from the suite above us. Not sure if all the other rooms have proper sound isolation?  Also all the wood furniture had glass covers with sharp edges on top dangerous for kids.    On departure, I inquired if we can get a complimentary transfer to the Airport since it was advertised in the Hotel's brochure for those staying in a suite. I was told ""No"" because we paid for the upgrade upon arrival not ahead of time. After all the other issues this was not welcoming at all.    After reviewing our final bill I found out we were billed for the high-speed internet twice in one day. After my request to revise the charge I got a respond: ""Done"". No apology no explanation.  All the things listed below should not be encountered at the hotel of that price level.

Don't be fooled by thinking that because this particular building is one of the farthest away from beach that it is not as nice. In fact, we LOVED being away from the pool area (can get noisy) and the fact that we could self park literally right in front of our room. The room was amazing and it's second bathroom had a steam shower (our friend's one level below had an incredible outdoor shower!). The beds were so comfortable! I am not sure what some reviewers are referring to when they say the rooms need updating. The service is unparalleled. The only issue we had was a refrigerator that wasn't working when we got to our room--however it was replaced immediately. The breakfast at 'ULU Ocean Grille is insane. So insane we had it twice. Our favorite server Hauoli couldn't have been warmer. We absolutely loved her and the level of service she provided. On the opening night of NFL football, we wanted to watch our beloved Seahawks only to find the channel had been blocked by the local cable provider. Their amazing and much appreciated solution? Open up the Hualalai Grille 4 hours earlier than normal, offer cold drinks, snacks, and menu items from another kitchen all in Four Seasons fashion all so that their guests could enjoy a football game on tv. Blown away. The property is simply incredible, well maintained and absolutely gorgeous down to the pool areas, gym, grounds, golf course, you name it. A huge bonus are the self serve laundry rooms conveniently located near each building. Beautiful place aside, it really is all about service, service, service.

These rooms are spectacular I don't know why the previous review says they need updating because they are incredible. The outdoor lava rock garden shower is a must have when you book. Words can't describe how beautiful the beach is so I won't even attempt it. You have to dine at Hualalai Grille and ask for Jason Thrasher he is one of the best servers we have ever had. Extremely laid back guy with a true Hawaiian vibe to him. The Monchong fish is one of the best fish we've tasted. At the beach tree pool Katie and Kristina took the most excellent care of us and have some of the greatest personalities around.

232494351,40,Great place; Rooms Need Updating,"This is a beautiful resort in a spectacular location with numerous, fantastic restaurants offering great food. The exterior spaces are extraordinary and there are some really great features, like one of the most extensive fitness centers I have seen at any 5-star resort in a long time. The spa is nice and the treatment areas are very serene. However, the massages are about 25% more expensive that at most 5-star resorts I've been to. Family-friendly amenities, like washers and dryers throughout the property, and the Trading Company, where you can buy food and drinks for your room, are great for longer stays. Room service was fairly prompt and usually very accurate. That said, I do have some things to note. The rooms are quite small for a 5-star resort that charges so much. And, the furnishings are tired--nicked and scratched and really no comfortable furniture to sink into after a day of sun and fun. Just one tired, old wicker chair that wasn't really comfortable at all. Finally, this resort, like many, is trying to be more green, and I am all for it--less frequent changing of linens and carafes of water instead of bottled water. All of this is great. But, what it boils down to is savings for the resort that they don't pass along to you. Instead, they inform you that in addition to all of the money they are saving, they actually add about $9.00 to your bill as a donation to a reforestation project. I'm all for reforestation projects. But, if the resort were really committed to conservation and not profit maximization, it would take at least some of the savings it realizes from the reduced laundry and bottled water and, instead, make a donation on behalf of each guest instead of tacking that onto your bill (you are able to opt out of it, if you want). Finally, we always like to take a few toiletries with us from fancy resorts as a reminder of the trip. You cannot do that here. They only offer refillable dispensers in the rooms. This is done in the name of conservation, and I am all for it. But none of that savings is passed along to the customer, and at least some of it should be.",Oct 2014,October 2014,Traveled with friends,,"Kennett Square, Pennsylvania"

This was very convenient as it was just across the path from the kid's club (which was included as part of our accommodation) where we were able to drop off our child for a few hours and then go about doing our own activities. The activities planned at the kids club was excellent where they spent some time at the kids venue followed by eagle ray feeding and some swimming (and staff walked around with icypoles for adults and kids around the pool area) in the kids pool area.    The hotel also provided great personal touches such as a welcome message written in washable crayon in the spa bath to our young daughter. Our daughter also brought a small soft toy with her from home which the room staff dressed it up in a mini robe which matched the ones hanging in our rooms. This was noticed when we came back from our day trip to the volcano tour.    The bathroom hair and body accessories were also very good, so much so that we bought some to take home.

The beach is nothing to rave about (big island beaches aren't in general) - but there is a nice cove that allows swimming in the ocean and the pools are all very nice.

Check in was a breeze and the staff accommodated my request to be moved next to our traveling companions with efficiency and with a smile on their faces. Our room (810) facing the ocean and Kings Pong was just beautiful. Morning sun on the balcony was a little warm at times, but watching the surfers and snorkelers made it so worth it. Housekeeping was unbelievable. Always checking to make sure everything was immaculate several times a day. I loved the beach and pool service. The attendants brought your ""chair set-ups"" as soon as they saw you choose your spot. Water refills were unending and they were always pleasant and always made sure our every need and request were attended to. Food and especially the drinks were quite pricey, but the quality and service made up for it.    My husband and friend played golf at the Hualalai one morning and were excited to report that it was one of the most beautiful and great courses they have ever played. (Prior to this, the golf courses at Cabo San Lucas were tops). My husband said he would go back to the Big Island just to play this course again. They also played the Kapalua Bay course and Wailea Emerald course on Maui. This one exceeded the beauty of those.    The concierge at the 4 Seasons was soooooo helpful. She spent a lot of time with us helping plan some off resort excursions and answered every question. We booked a luau at the Marriott (not worth it, imo) and helicopter tour with Paradise Helicopters. This helicopter tour was worth every penny spent. Our pilot, Danny, was unbelievable--so knowledgeable, funny, concise, and gave us extra time and experiences. I requested to fly over the ""green sand beach"" and he was more than willing to show it to us. He made several circles so that everybody could get great pictures. I absolutely loved this tour but of course weather was perfect and we got extra attention!! The volcano was active and we hovered over a ""skylight"" and watched the red hot lava churn and gurgle. We also saw where it was flowing and got amazing pictures of the red lava and burning trees.

You can imagine our disappointment then to see adults drinking beer and cocktails in the family pool among children. Not only did these people have more options than us (the adult and the adult adult pool were not crowded), but it was reckless drinking from glass in a pool?!? To add insult to injury, we were then left very confused when we were told we were unable to reserve pool side seating only to then be asked a short time later to move as the lounge seats we were using were reserved???

230257788,50,Outstanding Property and Exceptional Service,"I am a bit late on posting but my husband, son and I have been at the Four Seasons Hualalai the past two Thanksgivings and are already booked for this Thanksgiving. We love the resort.    To begin, the property is just gorgeous. Lots of pools to pick from and the swimming beach is great for kids as it is protected from big waves. And snorkeling on that beach is amazing. We always see turtles, and oftentimes those same turtles come up to the beach to bask in the sun. King's Pond is fantastic too as you get to see some amazing fish there.    The food in each of the restaurants is very good, especially the breakfast buffet each morning. The hotel does a wonderful job of catering to couples that are traveling for a romantic getaway, plus the families with kids. For example, the breakfast buffet and the Thanksgiving buffet all have separate areas for children with popular food items, including chocolate chip pancakes for breakfast and chicken nuggets for dinner. You never have to worry about picky eaters. Plus all the hotel staff are there to ensure you are having a blast. Any wish is met!    The Kids for All Seasons is perfect for children as well. My son would choose what activities sounded fun and he would go to them as he pleased. The people working there are very organized and careful about safety. My son also got to do an off-site excursion with the club, to visit a sea horse farm. He is still talking about that.    The rooms are nice and spacious. Turn down service is impeccable. Pool and beach-side service is wonderful too. I always have cold water right next to me as I sit, and the food and drink options are great as well. When we come back from tennis, the front staff offer us water and towels, and if we head out to dinner and it appear that it might rain, they immediately offer us cold water and umbrellas for our drive.    Tennis courts are amazing as well. We played each morning while my son did lessons. The tennis pros are great at working with kids and getting them excited to learn. There are balls, tennis rackets, fresh water, and gatorade at all times.    Having said all that, I wanted to mention that the concierge service is truly outstanding. When we booked for this upcoming Thanksgiving a few months ago, I emailed Concierge to ask them about reserving: 1) tennis courts and private lessons, 2) Thanksgiving dinner and 3) kid's club activities. Since I contacted them so early in the year, they still weren't able to book the above. However, without any prompting on my part, as the above got scheduled at the resort, I would get emails from Concierge advising me of my options. I emailed them back with my preferences and all was set. Within minutes I would get a written confirmation with all my preferences. By doing this, I ensured I got my favorite time slots for all of our activities. Summer, Kristen, Chenin and Debbie at Concierge are saving me so much time and are ensuring all is super smooth once I arrive. I appreciate that a lot! They are also great once we are there in helping us pick fun dining destinations, both on the resort and off (Monstera for sushi is my son's favorite off-site).    Finally, the benefits for Amex Platinum members are great. The free breakfast for two each morning is a wonderful benefit. So is the late check out for those with evening flights.    All in all, I really truly have nothing negative to say. I am counting the seconds to return to Kona for Thanksgiving.

It shouldn't be. Most Four Seasons try to provide this 5th star. Hualalai has it in spades.    I read reviews showing other hotels, even other Four Seasons, rate higher than this hotel.

229717917,50,"Exceptional, Iconic, Epic!","I have had, through my travel life, the good fortune to stay at some amazing places. When I think of my recent stay at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai, I struggled finding one word that I felt appropriate to describe my experience. And so I chose the words exceptional, iconic and epic.    My arrival: As soon as I arrived at Kona Airport, I got my rental car and drove to the resort where at the main gate I was greeted by Lisa who greeted me warmly with a big smile and so genuinely that I felt like parking my car on the side of the road and spending time with her there talking story. After driving a short while through Hualalai I arrived at the resort where I was once again greeted by an amazing team of people who immediately addressed me by name, offered to assist with my luggage and made me feel as if they knew me and I was just coming back home. Even though there was many names to remember, I guess the most unusual stuck with me. So to Brit and team, thank you for such amazing welcome.    The check-in: Timed appropriately and elegantly, Jason confirmed my reservation and once again welcomed me to the resort with oshibori towels and a refreshing beverage. Once this part was done, I then met Tom who personally drove me and my luggage to my room and graciously introduced me to the resort by highlighting the different areas from restaurants to pools, spa and other amenities. This in my opinion is one of the most difficult tasks when rooming a guest as often hotel employees may come across as ""rehearsed"". Tom was just flawless and through authentic conversation made my arrival and familiarization with the resort an awesome one. He epitomized what I consider true luxury and along with everyone involved in the arrival set the stage for an exceptional stay.    The rooms: Gorgeously appointed, stone floors, sustainable water and amenity programs in place. Beautiful linens and elegant touches throughout the room. I was lucky enough to be in a ground level room which featured not only an amazing bathroom but also a fabulous outdoor shower! My room was also located in the area by the adults only pool which was great for me as a solo traveler. Housekeeping and turndown services are also impeccable.    The resort: Truly a stunner. Seven pools that are very distinct and honestly you don't know which one to go to even though you may have one right outside your lanai door as I did. Meticulously manicured lawns and gardens. Exquisite shops, a beautiful golf course, great fitness facilities and a fantastic spa.    Dining: I experienced Beach Tree for lunch which offers a great menu that is very versatile. Service once again flawless. I saw two faces of Ulu, breakfast and dinner. Even though I'm not a breakfast eater, there are those times that I figure why not and here the amazing view just called for it. I also judge breakfast by a chef's ability to make bacon to perfection, the way I want it. The chefs at Ulu did just that and nourish me with amazing lemon ricotta pancakes that were so delish using maple syrup should be considered a crime. At dinner, the restaurant takes on a whole new meaning and persona. Glittery, balmy and very sensorial, especially if you are there during sunset. The cuisine at dinner was once again flawless and so was service. There are more restaurants in the resort, however I was only able to experience these two during my short stay.    The Spa: I treated myself to an aromatherapy massage which was performed in an outdoors hut. Very nice and friendly staff from the reception through the locker attendants to my therapist Mark who will give you one of the best massages I've ever had. Kapana in the spa facilities was courteous and did a great job showing me all the facilities from the indoor and outdoor showers to the steam and sauna rooms to the cold plunge pool.    Through pampering, exploring the island and cocktails at the pool, time to depart came too fast and I was just not ready to do that. Very special and skilled people (artistes) have the ability to create something I explain as ""seductive"" which is the art of creating a bespoke environment that you don't want to leave. Four Seasons Hualalai just did that and through it a fan was born.    Some of the artistes I came across and truly made an exceptional and iconic stay epic are: Hulu, Joe and Ryan at the reception.

It is our favorite resort period. I measure all other resorts against this one, and, typically, I am a little disappointed with others. However, I there are many resorts we have not had an opportunity to try (e.g. FS Bora Bora). The only other which compared was the Four Seasons Great Exuma in the Bahamas. Alas, it is no longer managed by the Four Seasons. The owners went into receivership and it has become a Sandals Resort. If you have never experienced a Four Seasons resort, you will be impressed. If you frequent Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton, Rosewood, St. Regis maybe not quite as much.

We especially enjoyed Restaurants Ulu and the Beach Tree, both with excellent service and many tasty dishes.

229215785,40,"Very good, but not excellent","I was definitely looking foward to my stay at this hotel - the images on this website and elsewhere as well as the very positive feedback made me think this could be a very special stay. Although, I had a pleasant time, I cannot say that it was exceptional.    The location of the hotel is quiet beautiful, wonderfully kept greens and a very elegant property. The porters are very friendly and efficient, the check-in porcess personal. After checking in, you are taken by a golf cart to your room, and some porters take the opportunity to show you the whole property (it didn't happen to us, but I did see others getting a grand tour).    The pools are very nice, basically there is one for each type of vacationer (family, couple etc.) and nothing has been left to chance. The restaurants as well are good, not overwhelming but the quality is definitely there. I found the ""simplest"" of them all, the Banyan Tree to be the best, service was definitely exceptional there.    The main problem with the hotel is with the beach. The beach itself is fine insofar as there is a medium-sized area where you can swim (in the morning) which is fairly protected from the waves. Sea turtles seem to like it here, which is pretty neat when you can swim right next to them. What does NOT work however is the whole deck chair assignment at the beach.    According to the hotel, you are not allowed to reserve deck chairs in the morning, which as such is fine. However, imagine my surprise when I came there to see a few chairs with a ""reserved"" sign. It turns out that those guests who book a suite are ALLOWED to reserve (but don't tell that to the ""common folk). This is something which I don't think is right, but even if it were, at least the hotel should have the decency to state this exception clearly in the hotel guidelines. That way we all know what the rules are. Also beach staff are not really motivated - they act as if you are bothering them when you request something...    The second thing is that housekeeping is rather uneven. For example, the first night of our stay, the maid was kind enough to leave a special cloth for cleaning my glasses. Two days later, it suddenly disappeared. Our waste disposal in the room whcih was divided into paper and other refuse suddenly disappeared on the last day for a lonely garbage can into which you were supposed to throw everything.

The resort is expansive so even though there was 95% capacity during our stay it did not feel one bit crowded. The meals were excellent especially the breakfast buffet at Oulu. Oulu also serves dinner but we were disappointed with the sushi selection.

Gym was awesome. Easy to navigate. Landscaping is unbelievable. Sea turtles daily come on the beach. Beach is rough so not as many places to swim accept in from of the family pool where its not rough. Awesome service. Always attentive to everything. Adult pool great bar and drinks. Wish it was more fun with music for example. They have the quiet pool which is great so the adult pool should be fun with music playing. Thats my only negative comment. Yes I am on vacation but also want to have fun at the pool. Music would make that pool more fun as most people that go to that pool are having drinks and would probably enjoy some music. Kings pond very neat with fish all around. My room was near Kings pond which was a awesome spot. Food was great. Ate at ULU grill two nights and the grill overlooking the golf course the last night. Beach tree was too casual in the meals and decided not to eat there. Wish the grill near the golf course menu was at Beach Tree location instead.    Great sunset views each night.

Maui was nice but it was people stacked on top of people, fighting for a chaise lounge. Hualalai is a huge resort compared to Maui. There was always a chaise on the beach. The ""beach"" service was awesome. The outdoor shower for our room was a nice amenity and was surprisingly relaxing. We only left the resort for a helicopter tour, so all of our meals were at the resort. We tried all the restaurants and were delighted most of the time. The Ulu and Beachtree have incredible oceanfront seating. Breakfast at Ulu was sooo nice, sitting right on the beach in the morning can't be beat. i would recommend Palm Grove for couples, it is nice and quiet. Heads up for the rest of the resort, don't be surprised to see children. Another heads up, swim with the sea turtles right on the resorts beach. The turtles also sun themselves on the beach in front of Kings Pond. We watched four sea turtles swim at the beach from our chaise everyday, usually in the afternoon.

If you have kids, the beach isn't the white sand silky soft beach. It is a rocky lava beach. I would say that Four Seasons Maui has a much bettter beach set-up. But Four Seasons Maui doesn't have the King's Pond. This is a terrific way to let kids get a feel for the big ocean, but in a small way. The fish are beyond beautiful and there are little docks to swim up to and play on. So if you have kids you should weigh the pro's and con's of both properties.

Every member of the staff goes above and beyond to make each guests stay a once in a life time experience. Each day was better than the previous day, with the staff going out of their way to make sure we were happy. Honestly, whatever line of business you are in, you should stay at the Hualalai just so you can see how the world's best hotel operates. The Hualalai overflows with Aloha spirit, and this is seen coming from each and every person who works there. They are a team and you can tell from the moment you arrive at the airport. The food is fabulous, the pools are beautiful, the restaurants are alive and exciting, and quite and romantic all at the same time. This is what is so amazing. Somehow, they manage to offer any and every type of experience imaginable, creating unique experiences for each guest not matter what the age. If you want the vacation of a lifetime, do yourself a favor and stay at the Hualalai. People mention the cost, but frankly, it's worth every penny. The food is expensive but not any more expensive than any other hotel in the islands, and anyone traveling to the islands must remember they are in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, so it's going to cost more than the mainland no matter what!

We were upgraded to a ocean view room next to the palm grove pool and the view was excellent. The outdoor lava shower was an instant hit. The only problem when you stay in a resort like this is that, it is very difficult to leave the property. So for the five nights we were there, we left only twice for a few hours. So if sightseeing is a top priority, you may want to do it from another property before resting here. We stayed in the volcano village for 2 nights prior to arrival do we did not have to spend long hours outside. We stay in top end resorts when we travel. This property will be right there on the top.

At check-in we were greeted with fresh juice, pineapple and hand towels. Then we were told we were upgraded to a suite since we were there for our honeymoon. We thought this was great but never could have imagined what we saw when we got to our room. Not only were we upgraded to a suite, we were upgraded to a deluxe suite that was larger than our apartment in the city of Boston! Suite #501 was amazing. It had a large living/dining area, two bathrooms (one had a steam room and the other connected to an outdoor lava rock shower), a large master bedroom and a large patio that you could access from both the bedroom and living area.    Not only was the suite amazing, Cindy in guest relations went out of her way to make us feel special on our honeymoon. When we first arrived we had a bottle of champagne waiting for us. Then, later that night, after returning from dinner, she left us a Hawaii Memories book and an 8 x 10 picture of us form our wedding.

225353817,50,Exceptional,"We stayed 4 days last weekend at FS Hualalai for our 35th wedding anniversary and it was wonderful. Not only is the resort beautiful and spacious, but the aloha spirit was alive and well among their staff and permeated their customer service. All the staff from the gardeners to managers were friendly and courteous, and all had lovely smiles on their faces, as if nothing would make them happier than to see that all of our needs were met. Even the staff who hauled people or equipment in the golf carts around the resort pulled over as we approached and wished us aloha, and they really meant it! In celebration of our anniversary, we were given a room upgrade to oceanfront, and the room was spacious and beautiful with a rock wall outdoor shower and our own clamshell double-lounge just off our lanai. We had coffee in the clamshell every morning overlooking the King’s Pond and the ocean, and it was just a supremely relaxing way to start the day. We had the bed and breakfast package and I definitely would recommend that for those who are considering staying here. Although the breakfast buffet was not extensive, it had everything we wanted and needed including multiple egg dishes (plus an omelet bar), breakfast meats (the applewood bacon was delicious), all sorts of tropical pastries, freshly squeezed tropical juices that they blend in a variety of ways every morning, and fresh tropical fruits grown almost entirely on the island. Although we had our choice of pools, we chose to lounge at the quiet pool adjacent to the Beach Tree restaurant. The pool staff were attentive, efficient, friendly, and helpful. They definitely work hard but had smiles on their faces and greeted people warmly at every opportunity. We golfed at the Hualalai course one day and it was challenging but not impossible to play. The views of the contrasting blue ocean and the black lava fields interspersed with deep green fairways and beautiful tropical flowers was otherworldly. The freshly baked cookies at the turn were a welcome treat to the golfers and to the Francolin partridges that loved the cookies as much as the humans did! Finally, a comment on the food at the restaurants, in one word: Outstanding. The Beach Tree was very good but we had one of our best meals ever at ULU. The Hualalai Roll was delicious and living on Oahu, we are used to having really good, fresh sushi and sashimi. The Hualalai roll was definitely worth the price as a pupu. The beet salad though was ethereal, made with freshly-picked-that-day beets and fresh Puna goat cheese that is lightly smoked by ULU’s chef, topped by a beautifully seasoned poha berry sauce that blended perfectly with the other ingredients. Even if you don’t like beets, you will love this salad! The main course of Hawaiian Hapu (sea bass, I believe) was equally exceptional. As I mentioned, this was one of the best meals we had ever eaten anywhere! In sum, the Four Seasons Hualalai was exceptional in every way. The staff are friendly and professional and the customer service in general was extraordinary. Although this is a pricy resort, it really is worth every penny and we are already talking about returning here soon.",Aug 2014,August 2014,Traveled as a couple,,Hawaii

224470356,50,luxurious and relaxing,"Wow oh wow, where do I begin? The hotel grounds are lusciously green and picturesque. The rooms are very luxurious from the ""I'm sleeping on the cloud bed"" to the rain shower. Our room faced the salt water pool so we were able to have our morning coffee out on the balcony. My spouse would spend most days golfing while I lounged by the beach. There are several pools to choose from so depending on your mood. The adult pool was nice but I preferred the beach side lounging. The staff was quick to bring food and drinks and there was a constant supply of ice water in my cup. Wild life is prominent on beach, I got to see many turtles. The sea water pool has the unique opportunity of swimming with hundreds of fish and you could even feed the sting ray. The restaurants on site were delish, recommend eating there at least once. If you are going with your spouse, an after dinner stroll by the ocean is a must for a complete romantical night 😉. We had a couples massage at their spa and it was beautiful. We were taken to an outdoor room that although was open to the elements, still has a private ambiance. The masseuses were skilled and the sheets we laid on were super soft. BTW, if you like outdoor showers, the one here is a must use 🚿! There is an on site store to buy necessities, a gas station, and a coffee shop that has great smoothies.

The breakfast is awesome. They gave us free little snacks in our room a couple of the nights - local goat cheese and taro crackers, champagne. I should mention we were there during the hurricane and they provided a complimentary buffet dinner, packed lunches and breakfast for the next day - they were really great. I really have no complaints. You pay a lot, but they treat you like you paid a lot. My biggest pet peeve in travelling is paying a lot but feeling ignored or like a second class citizen.

Breakfast at the only breakfast place on the property was $100 for the 3 of us (including a 9-year old), lunch at the couple of restaurants was $150 for the 3 of us, and dinner was $200 to $300 depending on wine/desserts. Unfortunately the resort is not near any restaurants or shopping centers so you are a captive audience at this resort. Our room was $1,500 a night (including taxes) and that was not a suite.

I am sure $$$$$$$ USD have been invested here. For those that are used to FS hotels and resorts this one in Kona is at the top 5 for sure (and I have stayed before in the FS Bora Bora and FS Maldivies). The resort has a good balance beetween couples and families and if you do not want to be distrub you have an adults pool and pleanty of space in the resort also for golfers you have your own golf course in the resort. The service is at the top offer by FS and the dinning option are excelent (my wife prefered the ULU restaurant for its location, 10 meters for the sea, and the tasting food, specialy the local Poke). The rooms are spacious and the gardens well treated. the beach are were you can swimming is not immense but you can always find a small turtle swimming along side with you.

Would recommend the golf ocean or palm grove for privacy although the golf ocean is a slightly longer walk to most of the pools and restaurants.

222526973,40,Beautiful resort..but..,"We stayed here with our 13yo son for a week and enjoyed the beautiful room (and outdoor shower--although a resident bee kept us out of it for the next 3 days) and amenities (laundry rooms conveniently located! loved that), great food, gorgeous ocean view, and friendly, hospitable staff. The resort is spacious enough that we never had to scramble for lounge chairs, never felt claustrophobic. We had a good time, no doubt. The ""but"" part here is that we had previously stayed at the Four Seasons Bora Bora, and we expected the same flawless experience, which it wasn't. The Kona version had a little more ""harried"" atmosphere, especially for breakfast, where the hostess never remembered us and kept on asking ""How many in the group?"" when it was the same 3 people standing in front of her daily for a week. The sunset viewing in front of the Beach Tree restaurant was chaotic--- kids and adults playing catch in front of diners, and I would hold my breath hoping their balls wouldn't knock out the nightly ukelele singer.    So I don't think it is the hotel's ""fault"" it has a different ""vibe"" as much as it is the fact that our expectations for what we were paying for were a lot different, and thus not met ; the bar was set so high previously. Might be because this resort is more accessible than Four Seasons Bora Bora, so it is is a lot more packed, a little rowdier, with a lot more kids running around. The staff in Tahiti seemed genuinely relaxed. Always remembered us! They even gave us a little bag to pack our breakfast leftovers for our snorkeling trip later in the day; in Kona, we got a polite but still somewhat condescending look and a suggestion :""you can order a sandwich to go"". For about the same price, I think we probably should have gone back to Bora Bora ! But don't get me wrong---this is a great resort, food was always wonderful ( we ate in all their restaurants).

221906554,50,Unforgettable Honeymoon! Beautiful property and staff that will blow you away!,"We stayed 6 nights at the Four Seasons Hualalai at Historic Ka'upulehu from July 31st to August 6th.    Our experience with this amazing hotel started well before we arrived, having made a booking we contacted the hotel and let them know that we will be spending a big part of our honeymoon at the property and kindly asked for a complimentary honeymoon upgrade, off course subject to hotel's discretion and availability.    Additionally concierge got in touch with me regarding activities and sent me a very detailed e-mail about things to do on the island and has kindly offered to make bookings of activities on my behalf. After a series of e-mails back and forth, the concierge team booked a snorkelling experience, a submarine and helicopter experience for us!    Dealing with concierge and not the service providers directly saved a lot of time and at the end of the process concierge team have put together an itinerary for us, with key dates, times, locations, directions so that we had the information that we needed to hand.    In the airport we were greeted by one of the Four Seasons greeters that went to fetch our luggage for us and within a couple of minutes of our arrival we were comfortably seated in the taxi van that was kindly arranged for us by the concierge.    Upon arrival we were greeted by one of the front desk staff named Jason, who offered us a refreshing drink as well as helped us check in at the comfort of a sofa in a personal, private environment, he also said that since we are on honeymoon and as per our e-mail request we will be upgraded from a basic room to the beautiful ocean view room.    From reception we were put on a golf cart and one of the bell staff drove us to our room, where we were greeted with a note from Jason and a selection of fruits and cheeses as a gift for our honeymoon. The room was clean, large with own outdoor shower! Very good, simple but elegant design.    For 6 days in the row we had the most amazing experience of our life.    The property is huge and has several beeches, from rocky to sandy, from busy to private and secluded, it has two golf courses and a sea-water swimming pool with over 3000 fish of 75 different species that you can swim with, snorkel, there is even an eagle ray that you can sign up to feed :)    Ohh the staff, they are all so kind and eager to help, eager to learn about you, eager to start a conversation and make your stay unforgettable, and I must tell you they did. Edwin working at the bell desk helped us out a million times, a very kind, softly spoken, educated gentleman who we are largely thankful to.    The Ulu restaurant at the property was very nice, the japanese cuisine with a local Hawaiian twist was great particularly all the tuna dishes which are an absolute must try. Average meal for two without wine at the property will cost you around $60-$120 bucks.    Generally the resort is probably the best of the best, very private not many people, very closed and exclusive (the most expensive resort on Hawaii).

221747253,50,A wonderful holiday,"We stayed here for 5 days at the start of August, although we heard the hotel was at 97% capacity it was always easy to find a lounger on the beach or by the pool of choice. The food was good, the best place for cocktails was at ULU sitting by the fire pit. We had two partial ocean view rooms near the family pool, they were well located and we enjoyed being able to walk out onto the grass to the different restaurants/pools. The staff were all very friendly and they have enough staff for them to be able to speak to you properly.    Highlights: mango rum popsicles by the main pool in the afternoon - better than the little nuggets of ice-cream coated in chocolate served in the morning, salmon flatbread at breakfast, good sushi.    We enjoyed the Tuscan evening at the Beach restaurant, delicious Tuscan bread and main courses. My daughter really liked the ice-cream balls served with dry ice.    I went for a walk 3 mornings with the personal trainers at 7am, this is a really good way to see the resort and they were both lovely - very knowledgeable and interesting. I also used the gym equipment and stretch area, both excellent. The lap pool was quiet and I enjoyed using that too. The ½ basketball court was fun and there is also a climbing wall which we did not use.    Having access to a washing machine & dryer made my life easier, there are a few scattered around the hotel grounds in the same building as ice machines.    We went to the Luau but it wasn't really our thing, I wouldn't go to one again & I don't think I could recommend it. The food sounded good but somehow going to a large buffet isn't really my thing, too much walking around and the lines were long, the tuna & octopus poke was probably the best thing I ate. They charged the same for my 13 & 16 year olds who obviously cannot drink alcohol and adults for whom alcoholic beverages were included which I felt was unreasonable. I asked the front desk why they operated this policy and she said they would come back to me but no one has (one week later). The luau was $165 each so you can understand my querying the cost for teenagers. My husband & son did not go to the Luau and I am glad I did not try to persuade them to join us.    The breakfast buffet was well managed with 3 staff replenishing the dishes so the food always looked fresh. At the weekend there was a crepe bar but the chefs cooking had not been successfully trained in preparing them and the crepes were disappointing, the batter was too thick so they tore and the pans too small.    Overall a lovely place and we saw turtles resting on the beach. We dived on two afternoons and also went on a helicopter tour.

The cultural center offers a fantastic program - all free, teaching ukelele playing, lei making, learning to speak Hawaiian, etc. Didn't play golf, but heard from friends staying there that the course is forgiving and unhurried.

Furthermore, once you check-in, you get the opportunity to tour the property in a golf cart, with the staff explaining the lay-out in detail.    We were upgraded to a premium ocean view room as it was our honeymoon, and we could feel the sea breeze and see the waves of the Pacific Ocean. We could also enjoy the view of the main swimming pool.    The hotel breakfast buffet was the best I have ever experienced! I have experienced many high-end hotels in Korea and abroad but I could say Four Seasons in Big Island offered the best breakfast buffet.

Great service, 4 good restaurants, nice pools, beautiful rooms, good gym.    The only thing that we missed (and that is definitely not the fault of the resort but lack of research from my end) is that you could not body surf in the waves as the beaches are filled with lava rocks. We did a number of other fun ocean activities with the professional team at Alakaʻi Nalu though such a snorkeling with dolphins (amazing experience) and stand-up paddling.    Even though it seemed to be high season we did not feel that it was crowded by the pool or in the gym. We stayed mainly by the quiet pool where the service was exceptional and by the nearby beach (1 mile walk). For dining we had made some dining reservations in advance but you could walk in for early dining at both the Ulu as well as the Beach tree restaurant. Food was always very tasty and the restaurants were flexible when it came to tricky food requests from our son.    Landscaping was amazing. I loved all the plants. Our rooms were great. We stayed by the King's Pond in an Ocean View Prime on the second floor and the kids had an Ocean View on the first floor. Their room had a murky smell, maybe from the outdoor shower (that they loved) but they did not seem to mind.    The spa facility was serine and beautiful, and the gym was well equipped.

219134286,30,Lacking Bang for your Buck,"We've stayed at the Four Seasons in Maui. The FS in **Maui** is the best hotel experience of my life so we were wondering if the FS Hualalai could outdo it.    Short answer: I don't think so.    First off, I'm not a fan of the Big Island itself. The ride from the airport to the hotel felt like a drive through a volcanic war-zone. Yes, I get the whole history of the volcanic island, and I can appreciate a little black lava rock here and there on the landscape for contrast, but the lava rock is literally everywhere. I guess that doesn't bother everybody, but I'm just saying I didn't like it--at all. I probably would have liked the Hilo side better since that is considered to be the lush, green side. But it's rainy there, so maybe not.    FS Hualalai tries very hard, and don't get me wrong, is an exquisite hotel by anyone's measure. And it does have some features that overshadow the Maui location. But if I was going to choose between the two, FS Maui is unbeatable.    Here are the PLUS POINTS of FS Hualalai:    * Resort is very close in proximity to the beach. Restaurants and some of the rooms are literally steps from the sand. The ocean view is IN YOUR FACE, and isn't that what you want at a resort? Let me answer this one for you. Yes, it is.    * Once you get to the hotel, the landscaping is green, green, green. Lots of greenery everywhere. Rainforest-like.    * The size of the resort is expansive and private. Everyone you see is a guest of the resort. You don't have people from other resorts cutting through your hotel property.    Here's where FS Hualalai fell short:    * CHECK-IN  When we arrived, the check-in process was awkward. We had to wait for our room to be cleaned, so we had a delayed check-in. The timing of it worked out fine since we had not eaten lunch yet, so we went to get a bite to eat while they prepped the room. When we got back from lunch, a gentleman in a hawaiian shirt that looked like he might be part of the check-in staff, barely introduced himself and handed me a cilpboard with a form to fill out. There was no ""...I'll be checking you in..."" introduction. He just gave us his name and kept standing there with the clipboard. Then, after a few more painful, awkward moments, he motions for us to fill out the form on the clipboard. All the time, we're wondering, is this the guy that's checking us in, or is this a bellman just getting some info before the main front desk staff person shows up?    Well, as it turned out, this guy in the hawaiian shirt **was** the main check-in guy. He didn't do a good job of welcoming us to the hotel. For me, it wasn't a good first impression at all. The bellman who met us a few minutes later was much more accommodating. He took us on his golf cart and took us to our room. We asked for a tour of the grounds before bringing us to our room and he agreed to do that for us.    * RENTAL CAR  Our rental car that we secured through the hotel was brought to us dirty--unwashed with trash from the previous guest still inside the car. If we weren't in such a rush that day, I would have said something, but we had to get on the road, so I didn't. Never expected that to happen at a hotel of this caliber. This is something I should have brought up to the front desk at check-out but I didn't feel like getting into it!    * COFFEE/CROISSANTS  The hotel supplies coffee and simple pastries in the lobby every morning. We would routinely go down to the lobby every morning to drink some coffee and relax a bit before getting the day started. Almost every morning of our stay, I had to go to the front desk to tell them that the coffee (and pastries!) were out, and that they needed to be replenished. Once I can understand, but every morning? It's all about the attention to details in the luxury hotel!    The room was nice and spacious, the bed comfortable, and the balcony very wide and private.    The food in the restaurants was hit and miss. For the most part, pretty good, but it took some time to figure out what was good on the menu. We found the Resident's Beach House to be the best for food. The desserts there were great and when I told the waitress how much I liked the dessert one night, she told me she would try to get the recipe for me. The next day, it was emailed to me. I found out that Resident's Beach House is not a part of the Four Season's resort.    Overall, a good experience but not great for me. I didn't feel like the price for the room was worth it. The best part of the hotel is the fact that the beach is so close to the hotel and the wait staff for the pool and beach area do a very good job of making sure you're taken care of.    I was going to give them a three star rating, but when I told my wife and daughter that, they freaked out and scolded me for ever having such a thought. So I'm giving FS Hualalai four stars since I'm factoring in my whole family's experience.",Aug 2014,July 2014,Traveled with family,,"San Jose, California"

It even had a steam shower with aromatherapy, a personal favorite of mine. My kids LOVED the snorkeling area, and we all LOVED the pool. It was very large, and never felt crowded. Although my kids are tweens now, I saw the toddler section which was a mom's dream come true - including mini cabanas and adirondack chairs and a zero entry sand bottom pool. As a side note - each collection of rooms had an building outside it with laundry facilities and all the supplies you could need - I was able to throw a few loads in before the end of our trip making our return home even relaxing!!! The staff is truly amazing, and should be the example of Customer Service for all other businesses - they are all kind and accommodating.

One can tell that they really love working at the resort which says a great deal about management and the resort itself. From reservations (Jessica) and throughout the duration of our stay (Damon and Joe) everyone made us feel welcome.

We all had a blast. Service was over the top as usual. Hands down best resort we have been to and worth the price if you are lookin for a peaceful stay without crowds of people.    Dineed were all good with the exception of the night we are at ulu. I ordered Mongolian beef and sent it back ad it was cooked to a crisp. The second round was slightly better, but still crispy and dry. But I ate it as I needed something and the kids were over dinner. Still, I consider it a good place to eat.

216839687,50,Perfect in every way,"From the reception upon arrival to the moment we checked out, the staff of the Four Seasons Hualalai was exceptional. Our family of 14 quickly became known as ""The Big O'hana"" with the resort staff. We are accustomed to struggling with reservations because of the party size, even at 5 diamond resorts, but we did not encounter this at Hualalai. One must see the property to believe it. The whole of the resort is beautifully landscaped to complement the idyllic location. The rooms are nicely sized and comfortably appointed. As one would expect from Four Seasons, no detail is overlooked. I particularly liked the pools designated for families or for adults only, as that sour look one receives from the childless traveler when one's child splashes accidentally him while playing in the pool is a personal pet peeve. Our younger children were fascinated by King's Pond and the turtle resting area on the beach. The resort offers plenty of added activities for children, including a babysitting service if one is so inclined. The restaurants are quite good and the cuisine types varied. Wifi is free for up to two devices per room. Perhaps the single negative, if one can even call it negative, is properly pronouncing the name of the resort and the resort location.

All three restaurants had outstanding food. The pools are wonderful and the fitness classes are fun and current.

Combine the location with the signature Four Seasons Service and you undoubtedly have a winning combination. There are a variety of pool settings for other families or adults. There are several dining options that are all world class and there is a signature Jack Nicklaus golf course that was easy to get onto and around. We have been to many Four Seasons properties around the world and this is surely in the top two.

While there is limited choice of venues for dinner we found over 6 nights it wasnt a problem as there are 4 really good choices...although you do need to make reservations and catching the sunset is sometimes tricky if you are expecting to walk up.The only other drawback is the beach isnt as good as Maui due to the volcanic rock - but the swimming with the turtles in the ocean pool made up for that.

It felt like being out in nature yet it was developed. Through our large walk-in shower, we could step outside to a private outdoor shower.

213402005,30,Great Hotel but they nickel and dime you for EVERYTHING!,"I paid about a $1200 a night for 7 nights based on the reviews on trip advisor.  I wanted to see what the fuss was all about.    The GOOD:  I was impressed with the service, the staff ask for your room number and then address you by name whenever they are waiting on you at that location.  Did not feel very crowded.  I appreciate the eco-friendly philosophy.  We loved snorkeling at the Kings Pond.  Paying an extra $100 a night for an ocean view was worth it.    The BAD:  One of the themes that interested me was that there was a lot to do here. However, unless you want to pay $80 for your child to learn about science and pay $25 for each yoga/spinning etc class you take...there is not much that is complementary with your room. It was $50 a day to play tennis!!!! Apart from the swimming pools, there is very little else to do save view the sunset on the beach. This was a total bummer.  Food is more expensive here than Michelin star restaurants. A regular entree is about $40. A meal for two could easily be $200 without alcohol.  The eco-friendly part was sometimes taken to extremes, soap bars were not replaced unless broken into bits.  The beautiful floor to ceiling plantation shutters let in too much light and we were always awake before 6:30am due to the room being too bright.    Summary: This is a very unique hotel where you pay for good service and it does not feel crowded BUT they limit a lot of the fun with outrageous pricing for small things that are normally free when you call yourself a resort.

212916794,30,Not nearly as Great as Expected,"We finished our trip to Hawaii on the Big Island after 5 night at the Four Seasons in Maui. Quite honestly, we have stayed in Maui at the Four Seasons many times and it blew away Hualalai. Don't get me wrong, Four Seasons Hualalai was extremely nice, but not like we had anticipated. I guess the build up was too much. We had 2 kids--17 & 14 --and my wife and I. We had connecting rooms that were on the 18th hole near the clubhouse on the ground floor. It was about 10-12 min walk to the breakfast restaurant, Ulu and another 3-5 min to King's Pond--which was excellent and we enjoyed very much. The rooms were very nice and the outdoor shower was nice. We had a great view of the 18th hole and a small sliver of ocean. I guess we were expecting a more of a wow factor from the rooms and the resort. Plus, we felt very removed from the heart of resort. The staff while nice, felt very out of touch. Just not the quality and care Maui gives. The restaurant, Ulu, at breakfast was decent the first 3 mornings and then dropped horribly the next 2 mornings. The birds were terrible as is the case in most Hawaii outdoor breakfast settings. The food was good, but not excellent. We tried a couple times to get into restaurants for dinner and we had no success. We finally had dinner at the Beach House, but had to eat at the bar. Our $200 bills resulted in very mediocre food and very slow service. Again, not what we expected from a 5 star hotel. The lack of reservations is tough because is a bit of a drive to go into Kona. I did golf one day and while the course is very, very nice, they had just sanded the greens and i was not told when i had made a tee time. Paying $275, you expect almost perfection. The round was to include unlimited play and unlimited non alcoholic drinks. I saw that person 1 time in 27 holes of play. Again, just average service for the money paid.  The best thing we encountered was the Kings Pond. We all enjoyed the complementary snorkel equipment and we did this several times. The views from all pools and restaurants were terrific.  We always finish a vacation with ""would we return to this resort?"" Our family was split 2 for and 2 against.

We were served food without utensils and did not get water despite requesting it. Staff seems less attentive. The biggest issue is that if you are renting a villa you are now considered a second class citizen ( despite spending $2000/ night!) The new policy is that villa renters cannot get a lounge chair at any of the pools. I had to stand in the hot sun while my 5 & 7 year old snorkels at the Kings Pond pool , even though there were 20-30 open lounges because we were villa renters and not staying in a standard hotel room! I was told I could have a lounge chair at the beach . Hello! How am I supposed to watch my kids from the beach when they are in the pool. Not to mention there is no lifeguard on duty. Oh..and by the way, villa renters can no longer get hotel reservations during prime time. Do yourself a favor- do not rent a villa here and seriously consider nit staying at the hotel .

212219912,50,Amazing,"Had an incredible stay here in June 2014. We have stayed in a handful of Four Seasons previously, but this resort ranks right at the top. There is a ""feel"" here that we did not experience on any of the other islands, but it hits you immediately when you arrive. I really like how the resort is situated so close to the beach. Sitting at the Beach Tree or Ulu and being able to watch and listen to the waves never did get old. One morning we saw a pod of dolphins jumping and spinning.    We had connecting rooms in building #2. We had a great view of the water and sunset. It was so nice we that we had room service for dinner every night after some exhausting days. The rooms feel more like you are in a house than a hotel - except for the outdoor shower which you don't find in many homes. My only wish with Four Seasons is that they would provide more complimentary items in the rooms like snacks, drinks, etc.    The kids loved the snorkel pond and didn't seem to mind how cold the water was. There was an eagle ray and many different types of tropical fish. I was surprised at how big and deep it was. There was a second pond, but it was knocked out of commission in the tsunami of 2011.    If the beach was a little more swimmer-friendly I would have probably stayed here forever. The coast is pretty rocky, but there is a small swimming beach. Also the sand is pretty narrow all the way down. But the service - food, chairs, towels, and drinks - was what you expect from Four Seasons. At no point did the resort seem crowded.    We saw a lot of sea turtles, both on the beach and in the water. You have to hunt for them on other islands, but here they seem to be everywhere, especially at low tide. It was one of the highlights of our stay.    We used the concierge to arrange a couple of different trips that were spot on. One required a taxi cab down to the marina, but they arranged it all and it went really smooth.    My only ""lesson learned"" results from an exchange that happened prior to our arrival, when trying to schedule a private dinner under the stars.

211017435,50,Unbelievable,"When pulling onto the winding roads leading up to the resort the first thing you will notice is an absence of greenery. Instead, you will see a swatch of road before you, and natural lava rock formations on all sides. After a few more minutes in the car you begin to see life all around you. The vast swatch of bright green that is the award winning golf course, the trees create a canopy above you, and the fragrant tropical flowers hang low and lush, acting almost like a curtain that contains nirvana behind it.    We pulled up to the front and were immediately greeted by name. Ushered into the lobby we were again welcomed with leis, a cool towel, and a drink. The lobby itself is open air, masterfully crafted and breathtakingly beautiful.    We were driven by golf cart to our ground floor bungalow. The rooms are fantastic. Modern but with the spirit of old Hawaii. Beautifully appointed furniture, spacious, two floor to ceiling wooden shades covered an entire wall. The shades were opened and before us was a private veranda complete with dining table and chairs...and a view that was breathtaking. I witnessed large sea turtles basking in the tropical sun just a few feet from my vantage point.    The bathroom was gorgeous. Luxurious. As to be expected, but the most magical amenity was the outdoor lava shower. Picture large smooth blue slate stone under your feet. Tropical plants and flowers in the corners offer a sweet aroma. A thatched roof which lets the sunlight through and a shower which will quite literally wash any worry you have away at that moment. Imagine showering as the sunlight beams down, warming your body and illuminating the drops of water as if they were diamonds falling. Imagine in the evening as the soft light from the bathroom shines in listening to the crickets chirp and the waves crash feet away. Completely private and closed in, it was a dream come true.    The staff here is extraordinary, exemplary, and world class. You are treated with the utmost respect at all times. There is nothing more important to them that making sure you have a fantastic stay. As you stroll the grounds, employees talking will hush so as not to disturb you. As you lounge in the pool or on the beach staff will try to make you as comfortable as possible, bringing you water and towels and such. In room dining was fantastic, as was their restaurant ulu. I've never eaten so good in my life.    As for the grounds, they are unreal. Everything is manicured with the greatest attention to detail. The beach is beautiful. A small cove was created to shield their guests from rough surf. As you bathe in the lukewarm water prepare to be poked by curious fish and sea turtles. They won't hurt you! The waters are teeming with life, it is magic to see.    We were extraordinarily sad to leave this place.

210774957,50,Best in Hawaii,"Hualalai is a fabulous resort that really captures the natural beauty and essence of Hawaii. We've visited a number of times over the past 15 years and it's still our favorite Hawaiian resort. Here are my positives and negatives:    Positives: Spacious well-appointed rooms with large closets and bathrooms, lots of storage, comfortable beds; delicious food and many options on property, great breakfasts; drinks at Beach Tree or Resident's bar during sunset is a must; terrific well-equipped gym and spa; layout of property, pools and buildings perfectly maximizes views and proximity to the water; plenty to do for all ages and very accommodating for children to handicapped; excellent service throughout property; terrific golf plus the greens fee allows you to play all day - my husband did 36 holes in 4.5 hours; we recognized many long-time employees which speaks highly of the company; booking with Amex Platinum provides several worthwhile amenities like continental breakfast (though it's worth noting that the ""free one category upgrade when available"" is NEVER available!!).    Negatives: Upon arrival we were seated on a sofa and presented with the option of upgrading several categories from our prime ocean view room that was already perfectly amazing and costing $1,000/night - to a junior suite for an additional $575/night or some other option for $400/night- an appreciated and probably good deal but nonetheless an awkward money-related conversation that should not have been presented in front of children and only makes you feel like you're cheaping out when you turn it down (perhaps do this in writing or a more subtle manner); hotel seems to particularly cater to residents of the adjacent properties (per insider tip) as we noticed on several occasions prime pool chairs that were set up but remained unoccupied all day when we were explicitly told that if we left our chairs for more than 2 hours we'd lose them; Everything from food to spa to golf is very pricey; property felt more crowded than normal despite going when we thought most public schools were still in session; and on a couple occasions we had to take last seating for dinner when we didn't have advance reservations.    Overall despite feeling crowded this time it's still the best but definitely a splurge.

210493996,50,Amazing,"This resort hosted my honeymoon and best vacation ever! I have been to many resorts in Caribbean and Jamaica. There are always little kinks in the service which marginalize the overall experience. From arriving at the resort to leaving on last day the service was exceptional! All the attention to detail really made the difference.    When we first arrived we were greeted promptly and given hot wash clothes, Mai tais, and tea to refresh after a long flight. We were graciously upgraded to a better room in celebration of our honeymoon. Immediately upon settling the details of our stay, another staff member intercepted us, took us on tour of resort and brought us to our room. This sounds easy enough, but after staying at many resorts, NO ONE has had such a seamless introduction. There is always a delay after getting to resort and annoying choppy intro to room. Not at the Four Seasons.    The room was relatively large, very comfortable bed, nice large bathroom, and incredible view of the ocean. We sprung for the breakfast in bed package, which was slightly good deal (saving around ~$5/day) and I would likely do it again. Room service was always very prompt, courteous, and even toasted your toast in-room!    The resort itself was large, but not overwhelming. It seemed to be perfect size for week stay. We were able to cycle through the different restaurants and re-visit the favorites once. Food was amazing at all spots. I actually like the residents best with relaxed atmosphere, excellent american cuisine, and a beach front location that was fairly dreamy.    We ended up golfing and it was a VERY nice course. It was also VERY expensive, but once in a lifetime type round. There are several picturesque holes including 17 which is a par 3 towards the ocean. It is amazing view, but challenging with the wind coming off the ocean. You get free run of the facilities including driving range, putting green, and bunker. All non-booze drinks are complimentary with the round. The course is flexible with timing and I was able to golf by myself with wife caddy/driving the cart. The drink cart was seldom but SUPER friendly. He would always load us with ice and complimentary teas and Arnold Palmers with all drink orders!    As an added bonus, we were given near-nightly complimentary amenities in celebration of honeymoon. I could go on forever, but long story short, this resort has set the standard for vacation excellence! It will be hard to measure up! The service was the best I've ever had.",Jun 2014,June 2014,Traveled as a couple,,"Seattle, Washington"
210443828,50,Our Favorite Resort,"This was our second stay and we loved our experience. The room was an oceanfront, the same that we had on our last visit, and we loved it. A recent reviewer compared the rooms to a resort in Mexico that was similarly priced and she found the room lacking by comparison. We have stayed at the Rosewood Mayakoba in Playa del Carmen and I will freely admit that the room there was, without doubt, the nicest we have ever had, absolutely gorgeous. However, we found the overall experience there lacking in comparison to the Four Seasons Hualalai. The service at 4S is truly beyond comparison; we have never had a request not granted. I don't think the word ""no"" is in their collective vocabulary. The resort is beautiful and beautifully maintained, with every possible amenity. In addition, you can find all manner of interesting and beautiful experiences around the island.  Having said all that, we did have a couple of minor disappointments. The resort had placed some beach games on the sand right outside our room. We did not find this so annoying when people were actually playing them but that was the minority of the time. What was annoying was having the toys in our otherwise unobstucted ocean view 24/7. The second disappointment was the change in the Palm Grove since our last visit. At that time, it was literally a Palm Gove with a small quiet pool, without pool service, and beautiful day beds spread all over the grove, all with some sense of privacy. On this visit, some of the palms had been cut down and the pool has been expanded to a large pool with pool service and swim up bar. There are only three remaining daybeds, much less private, and there is a fee to use them. Though we enjoyed this pool and it was undoubtedly a financial ""win"" for the resort, what we had considered a very special ambiance was lost. Still, the stay was wonderful and, though the resort IS pricey, I would definitely recommednd it for a special occasion.",Jun 2014,May 2014,Traveled as a couple,"During our first stay, four years ago, we booked an oceanfront room and were given Rm 1801.

210228637,40,"Lovely resort, but pricey","I struggled on what to write here because the reality is that my husband and I had a wonderful time at this resort and have no complaints whatsoever. however, my challenge is that the similar experiences I've had in Mexico are so close to my heart that I found myself comparing the two and expecting more from the $1,000/nt price tag of the Four Seasons.    to start with, know that the resort is divided into four different ocean-facing crescents, each with a different atmosphere. there's a 21+ adult pool with a bar called Palm Grove, a quiet pool (several people mentioned being asked to leave there), a large kid's area with wading pool for the little ones called Beach Tree, and a snorkeling pond filled with (2,000?) fish and a spotted Eagle ray called King's pond. despite not being adults-only, my husband and I were able to customize our pool experience to fit that vibe. if not for the restaurants, we wouldn't have known kids were there, which was important to us.    before arriving at the resort, we really wanted to know what to expect in terms of prices. here's a rough outline:  drinks at pool bar - $14 ea  poolside lunch at Beach Tree - $15 appetizer, $25 entree  dinner at Beach Tree (shared app, two entrees, dessert, no drinks) - $115 incl. tip  breakfast buffet w/one drink - $45  breakfast entree - $25    we didn't try Ulu or the steakhouse for dinner, but I imagine that both were priced higher than Beach Tree. after souvenirs, our resort spend totaled close to $425 across 4 days, and we were VERY conservative.    that being said, the food was orgasmically good. like, where you take a bite and your eyes roll back and you try to mutter something unintelligible about just how incredible it is. we recommend the gazpacho and seared ahi tuna sandwich for lunch (it's large enough to split), the pizza (I know, but the flour for the dough is flown in from Italy!), and DO NOT MISS the desserts. there's a kona coffee macadamia nut rocky road ice cream at Beach Tree and some sort of chocolate cake from the steakhouse that you can also request through room service (mind the $6 fee and 18% grat). we often grabbed breakfast at the general store by the tennis courts that others mentioned. breakfast tacos were $9, as were smoothies. they also had some steel cut oats for slightly less, and, of course, delicious coffee drinks. so after a grab-and-go breakfast, shared lunch entree and dinner, we were around $200/day without drinks. whew. that said, many of the menus have notes saying how many local farmers are supported by the food options there, which is awesome. at least much of your food money is flowing back in to hawaii.    the resort is located 20+ mins from town. one couple reported a cab was $80 each way (?!), so definitely rent a car if you're looking to do some exploring.    while we were there, we ran into a marketing team tasked with making the resort attractive to younger couples and honeymooners, as a good deal of the population there was older. and I have to say that Mexico's competitiveness makes their job nearly impossible. an adults-only all inclusive runs a mere $400/nt there, which is less than half of the cost of the Four Seasons, and food a drinks are included!    honestly, if you go to hawaii, do hawaii things. if you want to relax and lay by the beach, your money will go infinitely further in Mexico. true, it's not the five star quality that the Four Seasons offers, but it's well worth the difference. honestly, it seems as though the FS is surviving partly by reputation through an older clientele and others who simply don't know what else is out there. no doubt this is the nicest place on the island, but they have the highest APD (average per day) spend of any Four Seasons property, so you'll pay for it. all the staff was wonderful and invited us to return with genuine care and first-class hospitality, but unless there's a dramatic shift in the pricing (and/or consideration of an all-inclusive option), we will continue to spend our beach time in the idyllic Caribbean waters.",Jun 2014,June 2014,Traveled as a couple,,"Austin, Texas"

Talk about saving the best for last! Check-in staff were cordial and accommodating and allowed us to use the pool and lunch on the property as our two partial ocean view rooms were not yet ready (it was about 10:00AM).    The property is massive with about 7 pools and we lounged around the cozy cabanas in the family-friendly Sea Shell infinity pool overlooking the beach. Food at the Beach Tree Bar and Lounge was satisfactory and the wine list was great! Order the cheeseburger but watch out for the birds.. they swoop down and nick your food when you're not looking. Dinner at the Hualalai Grille was average but the service and ambiance were excellent. We ordered the 3 Filet Mignons medium-rare which disappointed us as meat was dry. The wine list, however, was expansive and definitely a winner!    Connecting rooms were large and luxurious with a terrace and kids got personalized messages on their bathtubs and received gifts like stuffed turtle toys, caramelized popcorn & M&Ms, and a hula skirt. They were thrilled. We loved that they supported the local groups by purchasing their shampoo, lotion & body wash amenities from them.    The gym space was huge. There are separate rooms for the cardio equipment, weights and some machines were outside in case guests preferred a no-aircon environment. There were several studios as well for yoga and many choices of classes were offered during the day.    Overall, our only regret was not staying longer!

However, this place keeps on amazing you even after the first visit. It is truly a special place and I would consider giving it 6 stars if I could.    The services is very personal and friendly without being over the top far better than even some other well run places like the Four Seasons in Maui. The environment is serene and beautiful.    I think it is probably equally good without children, it is particularly great for families. The number of activities available such as the snorkeling pond and the kids club as well as the protected beach are delightful and classy without detracting from the enjoyment of adults.    I am a hardcore foodie and usually find the restaurants in these kind of hotels a bit lacking. The Four Seasons Hualalai, while not a gourmet paradise, offers very solid options.

We like to chose a lower room for the outdoor shower option, and without kids the beach tree or palm grove side (or even the golf course side) are the best options. With kids, stay on the sea shell or kings pond sides.  Also do the bed and breakfast option. You eat enough at a late buffet that you can make it all the way to dinner.

Eric at the Adult pool was fantastic and hard working. Concierge desk is extremely helpful.    Things to consider:    - just have to say that the wifi is terrible (I actually did a speed test on it and it was less than 0.5MB, and your home internet is probably 15MB). So you can pay an extra $20 per day for real wifi, but this all seems so counter-intuitive to the exceptional service you get everywhere else on the resort  - resort is located on the western (dry) side of the island. Many attractions are a far drive away. And given the perfection at the resort, it will be hard to get motivated to get out and see the island.  - tremendous fitness center. Not many restaurant options, and I can see how they would get old if you had a lengthy stay, as some mention.  - golf course was not crowded at all on Memorial Day weekend  - beach could be better, as many have noted, but it is still gorgeous. And the snorkeling pool seems under-utilized and definitely worth checking out    Overall this resort looks just like the photos on the internet, if not better.

The resort itself is very large and spread out, which helps it feel quiet and serene. The rooms are fabulous and spacious (including a very large lenai) and even housekeeping was at the top of their game. The property is beautiful and the setting is very peaceful. There doesn't seem to be anything this hotel hasn't though of. My only somewhat negative feedback would be regarding the restaurants. The hotel is fairly secluded and the closest off property restaurant is perhaps 25 minutes away. There are several restaurants on property, but it can be difficult to get a reservation. If management could improve on that it would truly make for an absolutely stress free, relaxing experience. But that doesn't detract from all the other great things about this property.

And it is hard to choose because they have had their pros and cons. On this occasion, we have enjoyed an ocean front one bedroom suite on the upper level, rooms are situated on two level structures. The view was unbeatable since you really can not get any closer to the water. With the main restaurant steps away, It was perfect for enjoying the best breakfast buffet you could hope for and roll back into bed before a great day.  The bedroom has a wonderfully comfortable bed, with access to the expansive lanai (Balcony) and a nice walk in closet with a great bathroom. Large separate shower, deep soaking bath tub and nice counters with double sink. Lower level suites may have additional exterior lava rock showers, we missed that on this room. The living room is nicely appointed with a desk and a sofa that can convert to a bed, we tried it for fun and well, for sofa beds its just ok, I wouldn't count on it for a long stay. A separate full bathroom with nice shower. The living area has another access to the lanai and a breakfast table with two chairs outside, and a very comfortable lounging couch perfect for an afternoon nap. A very comfortable and spacious room indeed.  The numerous pools are a joy to explore and our favorite continues to be the quiet pool which we had to travel to this time being further away, a nice walk. The golf course here is magnificent, just incredibly dramatic and well planned, a lot of fun to explore.  The spa and fitness center is another destination that you could spend all day in. It has outdoor gender separate areas with whirlpool and cold plunge pool, steam, sauna and lava rock outdoor showers. It's hard to beat anywhere in the world, additional indoor marble and mosaic showers available. A lap pool as big as most hotels main pools, and fabulous sports facilities, Tennis, Yoga, Pilates, Basketball and rock climbing are on the list.    In general there were more guests this time around, the resort has ideal event facilities and big groups can coincide with your plans, It took away the secluded feeling at times also while it is the perfect resort for children, we missed the peace that we have enjoyed in the past.  But it is so big that we were able to find our quiet time with no problem, just keep walking.    Very noticeable changes have happened since our last visit in terms of service and amenities, the most noticeable was a true effort to be ""green"" albeit at the expense of some deep rooted expectations which are very hard to give up when you are not forewarned.  There are no plastic bottles of water in the rooms, instead there is a clay jar that is filled with water and has two little matching cups. I like the idea but I also would like to see into the container being that we are in a tropical setting, before I can feel comfortable drinking water from it for starters.  Gone are the little bottles of toiletries and in are the big pumps Gym style, in plastic. The actual products are rich and delicious to use, I would change the bottles to something more unique perhaps in Koa wood?.  Out are the bath salts and bath soaps, ""please contact your concierge"" not very convenient for a late night spur of the moment luxurious whim. I'm sure the selection is better, but I didn't get to use it, its like keeping the champagne cold... at the corner store.  Also gone are the sunglass microfiber cleaner cloths left under your sunglasses upon returning from lunch, sadly nothing replaces that detail.  Safe are the fuxia orchids from the perils of beautiful but foredoomed display resulting in wilt, there are none to be found by my lonely toothbrush, towels and bedside. They use to put orchids on more than drinks.  I highly recommend heeding the concierges pre check-in email about dining reservations, we refused to place time restrictions around our days but found ourselves having to struggle to get a table anywhere at peak times due to limited availability. Not fun when hungry, room service food was not up to par this time, the pasta especially.  They also grouped the beach beds together and now you must endure your neighbors phone conversations until they pass out, or move to the outskirts and risk being neglected by the amenity fairies, the super nice comp snacks and shots of smoothie blue lemonades and cool towels. The beach beds use to be spread out and in pairs, very private feel.  There are new Hammocks and cabanas that are in my opinion too big and take away from the landscape of beauty and nature, this by the quiet pool. They are not ugly at least.  There use to be a feast under the stars that was a fantastic buffet with endless seafood and fabulous desserts, thats been replaced by an Italian version of a grill thing, can't compare it. On top of it, who wants to listen to eighties songs played by ukulele, Id rather listen to hawaiian music a million times over. All this by the Beach Tree restaurant, which by the way the poor beach tree was damaged by a storm and they decided to plant a new one next to the leaning original, it adds to the mystique.  Beach tree service off hours is spotty at best. But try the fish tacos and the ice-cream cookies and you will let any thing slide.  The Breakfast buffet continues to be excellent, the same guy doing omelettes is there, he was close to his millionth omelette! Upon seating, you are offered the juices of the day and one time our server said fresh squeezed oj/pineapple was being offered, not so. If you want real fresh squeezed oj you must order it and you will pay an additional charge, which is fine.    When it comes to service, maybe it was the larger number of people but we really liked to be recognized by name on the previous visit. There were no name recognitions this time. We also usually get the welcome fruit basket or a chocolate spread, after a couple of days I asked if they had forgotten, and that evening they so generously did send a chocolate seascape in a chocolate sandy beach, with an orchid. The excuse, the front desk said there were no notes, no notes?  Before there was also a little gathering where pupus, (hors d'oeuvres) and a Koa tree planting speech was offered, that we did not get invited to, I wonder if it is also a thing of the past.    We feel this is our favorite resort in the world and as it explores new ways to remain number one in many lists and hearts, I do hope they can recognize that some changes are good and some are better, but others could be reversed or in my view, forwarded.  We will be back and hopefully we will have new good surprises.",Jun 2014,October 2013,Traveled as a couple,"Lower level for lava showers, Higher level for views.","Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA"

There isn't much to say other than that it is heaven and absolute perfection. The grounds were gorgeous, the staff was top-notch and consistently went the extra mile, the facilities were fantastic and the food was terrific. It is expensive, but it is worth every penny. Since we were there for our anniversary and wanted a quieter, less-family friendly scene, we requested a room on the Palm Grove Crescent and it was perfect (though the Beach Tree Crescent would've been great for our purposes too). That being said, the property is definitely family friendly as well. Also, there are a ton of activities and things to do at the resort.

The adults only Palm Grove pool with swim up bar was where we spent most of our time. The bartenders made us pina coladas with macadamia liqueur on request. The Seashell? pool had these nooks where you could sit as though you were in a lounge chair, submerged in the water. Kings Pond looked better online/on TV (Samantha Brown) than in person, but thats just my opinion. The poolside staff was fantastic. In-room dining was fantastic. The outdoor lava rock showers are a neat touch! There are laundry rooms near the villas which were totally free, even detergent and softener provided.

""No"" is simply a term that does not exist at this property. A few years back, we would get a rental car to go off property for additional dinning and shopping choices. This year, the concierge arranged to only use the rental car for a day, something we highly recommend. Once you enter the resort, the desire to go off-site quickly vanishes. The one problem with this resort is that it has raised our expectation for all our other travel ventures.

We were initially placed in a room overlooking the gold course, and there was a problem in our bathroom. We were moved the following morning by the manager himself to an ocean view suite, who also reserved us a cabana and lunch for the day for our troubles. We left the resort 2-3 times for day trips, but looking back we wished we had just stayed on this beautiful property the whole time. Wonderful restaurants and food, exceptional service. The adult pool and beach area were really nice given the amount of children staying in the resort. The King Pond was awesome and worth a swim in.

207650295,50,Five Star Tropical Paradise,"First, the resort is very, very expensive and I couldn't find any great deals for the off-season time we were going. The best I could do was 10% off through a Jetsetter deal.    Second, we were celebrating a big birthday and I had let them know several times. I was hoping to get a complimentary upgrade, of course, but was disappointed when our ""partial ocean view"" room had no ocean view at all, not even from our Lanai. You had to walk to the end of the path to see it. I let them know that the room was mis-categorized and we moved on the second day of a five day stay.    Otherwise, this resort is all five star. My favorite pool of the seven was the adults only infinity with the swim up bar. We didn't really want to go anywhere else. Eric at the pool not only remembered us when we returned, but around the resort. If he ran into us, he would say hello to us by name. A decadent treat was him arranging for a by the pool foot massage.    We fed the Eagle Ray at King's Pond and went snorkeling there. We only saw two of the famous turtles on the beach during the five days.    We did the 5.4 mile around the property hike everyday. The nicest experience was when we were still 2.7 miles away and were hit with a downpour, a kind woman on a golf cart, not an employee, stopped and gave us her umbrella!! We were drenched by the time we returned.    The lava rock shower in our room was our favorite feature. We never even used the regular one. Every morning we would have a coffee on the lanai and at the end of the day would enjoy the evening view.    All the meals were really amazing. It was great quality and great service (like when a big wind came out of no where at Beach Tree, and the server brought us warm towels to wrap around us, or the day of my birthday when the breakfast server brought me birthday dessert... for breakfast!"" They also sent me birthday dessert to my room. Mai Tais were all delicious.    Each night, one sunset was better than the next. They light the ocean, from under the water which is another spectacular evening view. We had our own private happy hour each night on the beach or by one of the pools. Sometimes we brought our own wine and sometimes someone would bring us a Mai Tai.    A big rain storm hit while we were there and the beach was roped off. No problem, ahi burger and a cocktail was part of this day and we also did the property walking app.    My manicure was the most expensive one I ever had. (I pay $14 in the city). All the water sports played havoc on the nails, so only did the mani because it was the night of our special dinner at Ulu.    We spent our first three nights elsewhere because I knew once we arrived here, we wouldn't want to leave the resort and I wanted to see other parts of the island.

204124550,50,Excellent stay -- first time in Hawaii,"This was our family's first time visiting Hawaii and our first time at the Four Seasons Hualalai. Overall, we had an excellent stay and a positive experience. Any little issues we had were related to the fact that it was spring break week and the hotel was at full capacity. In my opinion, a luxury hotel should be designed to accommodate everyone with the same level of service regardless of how many are staying there, but it was clear that they were struggling a bit.    One situation that left a bad taste in our mouth had to do with beach & pool chairs. Every day the chairs at the popular pool and beach areas filled up quickly. One morning we decided to get to the beach very early (8 am) so that we could get the super comfy beach chairs in a prime spot. And we did! I was so excited. An hour and a half later, however, a beach attendant came over and told us that we would have to move because the chairs were ""reserved."" There had been no sign on the chairs indicating this (he said he put one on there and that it must have blown away or been moved) and we had already been sitting there for an hour and a half! Another attendant had set us up, someone brought us waters, we had all our stuff unpacked, etc. And instead of dealing with his own error and finding another spot for the family with reserved chairs, he insisted that WE move. We did, because I wasn't going to cause a scene at the beach (I'm trying to relax on vacation -- I'm not going to fight with an attendant about beach chairs), but I was mortified. It really ruined the entire morning for us.    Other than that, our stay was wonderful. The food was consistently great, and I have a shellfish allergy that each restaurant accommodated very nicely. The service (aside from the beach exchange) was excellent. The rooms were very nice, but next time we will opt for full ocean view instead of partial ocean view -- the partial is very partial. The pools and the beach were beautiful. My daughter loved the eagle ray feeding and snorkeling at King's Pond. I indulged in a 2-hour massage one afternoon and it was fantastic. I love the open air treatment rooms at the spa so you can listen to the birds and the breeze while getting your massage. The island itself is amazing. We took a drive around the entire perimeter and made stops at Volcanoes Nat'l Park, Akaka Falls, etc and it was wonderful. We look forward to coming back and staying at this FS again next year, but we will definitely avoid spring break!    Just a tip for anyone staying there at a busy time: If you have relatively quiet and/or older kid(s) and the main pool is packed, go to the Beachtree (quiet) pool. It's never full, even at peak times, and our daughter was very happy there. You will need to respect the ""quiet"" rule (no yelling, rough-housing, etc) but regular swimming, talking, etc is fine and it's a great option.",May 2014,April 2014,Traveled with family,,"Boulder, Colorado"

203998658,50,Setting the Standard in hospitality,"We stayed at the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai for a week in April to celebrate our son's graduation from culinary school.  Every member of staff, from concierge to grounds keepers showed us excellence in professional and thoughtful hospitality (from the time of inquiry for booking and throughout our stay) that sets the standard for the industry.    The location and grounds are beyond beautiful and set the stage for a wonderful experience alone.  But it is the impeccable attention to detail at every turn, with every interaction throughout the duration of our stay that has impressed me enough to take the time to write this review.    The Four Seasons Resort Hualalai at Historic Ka'upulehu manifests ""Aloha"" to it's fullest meaning, right before your eyes.    By the way, the food is excellent too !

203694867,50,Superb Resort,"There have been so many reviews written about this resort, it is difficult to add something really original but I will try.    Appearance: The 15 minute drive from the Kona airport is through a bleak lava field but then you turn left on to Ka'upulehu Drive to the lush green grass of the golf course. The road flows through the golf course until you reach the entrance to the resort. One of the most impressive features of the resort is the landscaping. I am not sure what was here before but now it is an idyllic tropical paradise with a profusion of plants and palm trees. Beautiful. Every day, there were numerous staff tidying and maintaining the grounds.    Rooms: We had a room in the King's Pond crescent. This was perfect for us. It had a natural feel and the pool is only open from 10 am to 4 pm making it quiet at the start and the end of the day. The rooms are not spectacular but they are very comfortable with great beds and all of the amenities you would expect in a 5* resort. Housekeeping was twice a day and the room was perfectly cleaned and tidied each time. The refillable bath and shower products were of a very high standard and do show a commitment to the environment.    Food: We did not have a disappointing meal the whole time we were there. The Beach Tree was our favourite because of the more relaxed atmosphere but the food in Ulu was excellent and we had a very good lunch at the Resident's Beach House. The breakfast buffet in Ulu was excellent and we really enjoyed lingering there in the mornings. Did not try the Hualalai Grill. We did have dinner on the beach one night, it was of a very high quality but it is expensive and may not be for everyone.    Facilities: The resort has everything on site that you could want. In addition to water sports and other acitivities, there is an interesting cultural center giving some insight into Hawaiian culture. You really don't have to leave but if you want to go out for a day, the resort can organise a rental car.    Beach: Some people comment that the beach is not perfect but it is good. Ocean access is difficult but as a place to sit, soak up the sun and watch the waves, it is hard to beat. There is an idyllic beach about 15 minutes walk south from the resort. Well worth a visit.    Spa: The Spa is excellent with a lap pool, saunas and plunge pools open to all guests. The fitness equipment is first class. We did not attend any of the classes but by all accounts these are excellent.    Staff: Everyone we encountered was helpful, professional and very welcoming. Some people went above and beyond what we expected: from the person who took care of a tray that I was carrying back to the room, to our morning server, Noi in Ulu, who learnt to make tea exactly the way we British like it!    Events: We were there with family and friends for our wedding. A big thank you to Carly and her team for making it such a relaxed and enjoyable occasion. The package offered may seem expensive, but when you consider what is included, it represents excellent value.    A couple of hints that we think might be helpful. When the resort is busy, it is a good idea to make restaurant reservations in advance of your arrival. The resort has a very different feel depending on what crescent you stay in. King's Pond has a more natural feel and the limited hours make this a quiet area in the mornings and evenings. Sea Shell crescent seems to be family oriented and ""busy"". The crescent around the Beach Tree is a mix of all worlds and the Palm Grove crescent has the feel of a couples only retreat.    Overall: This is an expensive resort but considering the location, the service and the amenities, we considered it to represent very fair value. Definitely worth a splurge.",May 2014,April 2014,Traveled with family,Upstairs rooms are a little bit brighter but the downstairs rooms have the outdoor lava showers....,"Belfast, United Kingdom"

202488126,50,"Four Seasons Hualalai, Best in the World","We've have stayed in private Four Seasons villas with pools in Bali, Suites in Paris at the George V, and visited more than one Aman but nothing compares to our experience at the Four Seasons Hualalai. From the moment you greeted with an aloha and a lei and enter the lobby looking out at the Beach Tree Pool and ocean beyond, you know you are checking in to paradise.    The service is warm, genuine, and welcoming from the moment you arrive. The staff really care about making you comfortable and introducing you to their beautiful island resort. As you ride to your room (600 sq ft. minimum) they might have time to tell you some of the highlights of the resort including, snorkeling at King's Pond stocked with beautiful reef fish, the ukulele classes, computers to use, Hawaiian language classes, basket weaving, guided nature tours, tennis courts, and fitness walk by the ocean (highly recommend) all free amenities. Every evening there will be a print out of the next days activities waiting for you by your bed, every day a new adventure or another opportunity to relax.    The rooms are very comfortable, decorated in tasteful Hawaiian decor. We've stayed in every cresent except the Palm Grove as we prefer to be a little closer to the gym and restaurants. All rooms at the hotel are beautiful and almost all have a view of the ocean. Even the slightly less expensive golf view rooms have beautiful views of the water. As with many Four Seasons you can request the type of pillow you want, hypoallergenic blankets and sheets, even aromatherapy.    Thoughtful touches abound. During our most recent stay I was awake due to the time difference and I didn't want to wake my partner. I thought, I wish they had a night light by the bed and when I opened the drawer I found just what I wanted. This intuative planning on the part of the hotel management is experienced throughout the resort from the perfectly timed smoothie tastings by the pool, guide to the fish in King's pond, to the sample they gave me from the amazing spa.    Tips: If you like the idea of an outdoor shower (we thought it was fun!), request a lower floor room.  If you would like a special main dish or dessert you don't see on the menu order it a few days in advance as a surprise for the person you are traveling with.  Take a kayak gently out into the ocean and quietly watch the dolphins play. End your evening by going up to the bar at Ulu Lounge for super service by Doug the deservedly famous bartender, to watch the illuminated waves wash upon the shore, and to listen to live music from Pahuia.  There are at least three complimentary coffee stations around the resort in the mornings. The lobby lounge offering has mini muffins if you arrive early. The other two locations are by the breakfast area near Ulu and near the gym.  They serve great frozen coffee drinks and fresh fruit smoothies near the gift shop (also worth a visit!). We already have two weeks booked this year and hope to stay three next year. If you have any questions about this resort or would like to take advantage of my group rate of $395 for June or December shoot me a message.    This resort is continually improving and breaking new grounds in luxurious comfort under the guidance of General Manager, Robert Whitfield. I'd also like to thank Beth who cares for and lead Hualalai's peerless athletic team, Jason, a fantastic front desk Manager, Carlos-the best massage therapist (and I've had many good massages but he is the best), Rita who keeps me afloat with her smile and aloha, and Angela, the incredible new chef of the Beachtree (recently back from cooking classes in Italy!).

My fiance wanted to move in she was so relaxed and I wanted to stay much longer that is for sure. We dined at Ulu's farm to table experience on Saturday and then we ate sushi the following night that was excellent coupled with great service and great saki. We loved the pools the most.

The only thing that could ever taint an experience here? Rude, self inflated guests that pout about things to the point of absurdity. What do they have to complain about? Who knows. They are probably never happy.    We love Kings Pond, The Resident's Club and Ulu for dining options. The Resident's Club has some of the best walu( sp?) fish tacos imaginable! The peanut butter & Jelly pie? crave worthy.  Ulu has wonderful fresh fish selections and the vanilla bean soufflés are a nice ending to a wonderful, oceanside dinner. The pool menu's have scarcely changed in 7 years & while I don't know what I would add, I would change them. * BUt I would NOT take the gingerbread cookie & strawberry ice cream sandwich off the menu, it is still sublime.  The Beach Tree offers outrageous pasta bolognese, panna cotta and short ribs. Heavier fare, but a nice alternative if fish is not your thing.

201745064,40,"Amazing grounds, rooms are over-priced for what you get","My husband and I decided to take a long weekend over MLK Day and head to the Big Island, with the express purpose of the trip being to stay at the Four Seasons Hualalai. Overall, we were very pleased with our time here.    The grounds are incredible - we've been lucky enough to stay at some very nice Four Seasons properties (including Bora Bora, Seychelles, and Maui), and the grounds at Hualalai were better than all of them. Specifically:    -The gym is the most incredible hotel gym I have ever seen. It has a full cardio area, a stretching / yoga area, a cycling area (class going on when I was there), a full weight room, and a lap pool. Every machine I used was in top-top shape.    -The landscaping of the grounds is immaculate. Seriously, it's beautiful. It's so well maintained, and I can't imagine how busy their landscaping team must be. It's an around-the-clock job to maintain a property of that size at that level.    -The pools are fabulous. There are five: the adults-only pool (with a swim-up bar, though oddly the bar lacks seats); the Banyan Tree pool; the children's pool; the snorkeling pool area; and the natural ocean pool. Though the hotel was booked solid, it generally was not difficult to find lawn chairs and staff were super-attentive. When my husband got stung by a jellyfish, they went to great lengths to make sure he received proper treatment, bringing the doctor down to check on him.    -The food, for a resort hotel, is really good. We ate on property pretty much the entire weekend, and we came away very impressed with the quality and diversity of their dining offerings. The only weak spot is lunch - there's only one restaurant open and even after 3 days, the menu seemed limited. If I was staying for a week or more, I'd have gotten real sick of all the options.    Really, my only complaint for this hotel is the room quality for the price. We stayed in a prime ocean view room, which cost around $1,500 a night. Color me unimpressed with this ""prime"" ocean view - it might be better than what most other rooms on premises offer, but it is hardly impressive and downright underwhelming (to the point that I was ticked off) at the price tag. We looked out over the snorkel pond to a sandy area with beach chairs and then BEYOND that you saw the ocean. And only if you stood out on the outdoor patio; from the room the view was basically nil.    The hotel is unquestionably the best one on the Big Island, so they can get away with charging exorbitant prices for their rooms, but I definitely felt like value-for-money was really lacking in the lodging department. If I were to return, I'd honestly book the cheapest room category possible, because the view from our ""prime view"" room just wasn't worth the additional $600+ per night that we paid.

This is a very expensive, exceptional service, gorgeous place with many amenities and one of the most wonderful staffs we have encountered anywhere. A few suggestions: Be aware that you need to make meal reservations as soon as you book or you will not likely get what you want - this is a bit crazy as you don't have a lay of the land or an understanding of the nature of the restaurants before you see and/or experience them.....Tell them if your children have birthdays while there as they do a marvelous job of celebrating at all meals if you like, by the poolside, and even decorating the room. The birthday cake was incredible - they even had little green geckos climbing all over the cake (fake of course!).....Bring a kite and blow up inner tubes for kids.....Bring beach shoes to go into the ocean as there are a lot of rocks and lobsters down there!!....Get to the snorkeling pond early as they only take 14 kids adults to feed the stingray each day.....Understand that kids 4 and under eat free at all meals but only if you are in a restaurant.....Beech Tree is the best restaurant for kids - best food and service too with a lawn where they can play and dance to the music......Sign your kids up for the art projects on the lawn behind the family pool - lots of fun but can be pricey. Downsides - the Kid's Club toys and games need not to be in a state of disrepair and there should be someone there at all times to supervise and assist (not to baby sit). They need more wait staff at every restaurant at dinner time (Beech Tree the best in this regard). They should raise the free food age to 5 from 4 - this age child doesn't eat much and food here is very expensive throughout the resort. Be prepared for a chaotic airport scene when you leave!

We loved the organization and flow of the property with the various pool and beach areas and the way the buildings were spread out.

The grounds are beautiful, you hear the ocean everyone, the fitness center is awesome, and the hotel staff were all kind and helpful. My wife and I traveled with my parents and our 2-year old son. We all plan to return.    ************    The resort has a great location in Kona and there are two beach restaurants that are unsurpassed in terms of proximity to the ocean, view, and experience. Despite the hotel being at 100% occupancy during spring break, it did not feel over crowded and we were able to get chairs setup at every pool.    The quality of amenities was very high, especially the indoor-outdoor fitness center, tennis center, and spa facilities. (We did not golf during our stay but have heard great things about the course). As others have mentioned, the sand is a bit course and the beaches are not the reason to visit this resort (although it has an awesome shoreline and is one of few places in Hawaii where you can see turtles chilling on land). However, this resort has awesome pools, especially Kings Pond which is a great spot to snorkel, feed an eagle ray, and have your kids experience a touch tank where they can hold starfish, sea cucumbers, and more in an educational setting. The kids pool has its own beach with plenty of toys available. There are washing machines and laundry + detergent throughout the resort, helping guests to travel light, or in our case, lighter.    And one more note on the kids - the hotel caters to and cares about your kids. The staff got to know our son and some interacted with him on a first name basis. The hotel had a list of complimentary items that guests can request for their kids, including baby bathtubs, toilet seats, and video monitors. Also, kids under five eat for free. We did not use the kids for all seasons but heard great things.    TRUE 5-STAR SERVICE - One thing the Four Seasons does better than anyone is to consistently provide superior service during the entire stay, from checking-in, to setting up the pool chairs, to the bellman gathering your bags. It feels like every staff member is invested in your relaxation. At Hualalai, we could not pass staff on a pathway without their cart slowing down to ensure our safety and wish us an aloha or good morning. I can only imagine staff training must be intense.    And one last note on service: Unlike other luxury hotels chains we've experienced, Four Seasons staff members are empowered to make decisions. You will almost never hear, ""let me check with my manager or you are welcome to speak with my manager"". What you hear instead is: ""no problem, I will take care of that."" This is the Four Seasons difference - they truly want you to have an enjoyable, hassle free vacation and go above and beyond their role and responsibilities to ensure that happens.    If you are willing to splurge, you will not be disappointed.",Apr 2014,March 2014,Traveled with family,,"Los Angeles, California"

199459289,40,Owners Get Top Service. Hotel Guests Not So Much.,"Stayed last week for our fourth time since this resort opened 15+ years ago. The setting is spectacular. Much nicer and more spread out than the Four Seasons Maui. Rooms are tremendous. Multiple pools. Great workout facilities. Very good restaurants. Golf, tennis, etc.,...lots to do.    This would be excellent except for the huge volume of renters and homeowners in the townhomes, condos, and single family homes that have been built over the years. Literally a logjam of golf carts descend upon the resort every day. They all have access to the Four Seasons and everything it offers. That means the pools, restaurants, coffee shop, spa, fitness center, etc., are very crowded. It also means that homeowners are justifiably greeted on a first name basis as they have longstanding relationships with the Four Seasons staff...and you as a hotel guest do not.

Otter pops were distributed there in the afternoon. The grounds and scenery were magnificent. It had a very beautiful walkway along the beach and golf course which my husband regularly jogged.

197821435,50,The Best of the Best,"We drove down the lava field driveway knowing it was going to be special. We had booked the two last nights of our trip here. the driveway security asked us if we were coming for lunch when we indicated we were checking in he jumped up said ""awesome"" got our named and we zoomed down to the entrance. We were greeted by name and our bags were taken away. From the moment you walk into the open air lobby we were seated with a petite mai tai, cool towel, and pineapple and checked in, very relaxing and calm. We were offered an upgrade for a reasonable rate, we declined opting to spend that on a few fabulous meals and dinners. When we returned we were generously upgraded to the Kou suite. Look it up - it is an enormous beachfront bungalow home right on the water. They clearly enjoyed seeing how happy we were when we heard the news. It was only surpassed by the look on our face when we actually got to the room. Just spectacular, yet in that cool effortless vibe the the FSH seems to hold the patent on. We had an expansive deck, 2 outdoor showers. We cancelled our dinner to eat on the deck as we had the perfect view of the sunset. Everyone at the hotel that we came into contact with was incredible and service minded without being over the top. We did dine outside our room a few times at Ulu and Beach Tree (my favorite) as well as some late night drinks at Residents Beach house, but for the most part we stayed in our hacienda by the sea and enjoyed some quality time together, after a very stressful few months. I know we would have had an amazing time in the room we booked. However our special treat was more appreciated than they will ever know. From Jason at the front desk, Ian our bellman, Ross at valet, and Chris in room dining and everyone else we had the opportunity to meet, we are grateful. If you came here to see if it is worth it, the answer is yes. The resort is laid out in a very careful way that you feel like you are in a serene tranquil place, authentic to hawaiian ideals and design not a mega resort that parrots the culture. I walked the property to see where our ""actual"" room would have been and it was beautiful!

There are a large number of different pools and restaurants to choose from. Service is top class. The whole location is very peaceful. Note however, that the swimming area on the beach is quite limited and attempting to swim off the beach is highly likely to result in cuts from the rocks. Unlike the Mauna Kea Hotel on the island, this hotel offers free Wi-Fi. The only criticism that we would have to make of the hotel is that the furnishings and décor of the rooms look a bit old fashioned and tired at this stage.",Mar 2014,February 2014,Traveled on business,,"Dublin, Ireland"
197542302,50,The most amazing place I've ever stayed,"First of all, this place is NOT cheap. But it's the most amazing place I've ever stayed, so it's totally worth it to me. What I like to do is stay here for the last few nights of my stay on the Big Island. It's kind of like travel dessert - a sweet ending that really helps you wind down at the end of your trip.    So why do I love this place so much? Here are my top 4 reasons:    1. Beautiful rooms (ground floor rooms have an outdoor shower!)  2. Amazing food  3. Great gym  4. Lots of pools!    Really, it just wouldn't be the same without all of these things. Check-in is pleasant - no standing at a desk after hours of traveling, waiting to get to your room. Instead you sit down on comfortable couches and receive a cold drink and a cool, refreshing towel while you go over the details of your stay in their open-air lobby, surrounded by tropical plants and ocean breezes. Definitely the best check-in experience I've encountered at any hotel. After this, one of the porters will bring you to your room in a golf cart and give you a little tour of the grounds if you haven't visited before. It's a little bit maze-like, so it's nice to be shown where the different pools, restaurants and things are. You can do self-parking (free) or valet parking during your stay.    ROOMS  The rooms are very nice - super comfortable beds, soaking tubs, lanais where you can have breakfast or watch the sun set, great showers and even an amazing outdoor shower if you end up with one of the ground floor rooms. There's a mini fridge for you to store some food. One great new thing I noticed when we visited recently was that they'd eliminated plastic water bottles from the rooms, replacing them with pitchers of fresh filtered water and locally-made ceramic cups for you to use. This cuts down on a lot of unnecessary wasted plastic, and I wish more places would do this! They've also replaced the little individual plastic bottles of shampoo/soap/conditioner in the bathrooms with larger dispensers. Kudos to Four Seasons for taking this step in reducing waste! The bath products they use smell REALLY nice, too - not too perfume-y, just natural and the shea butter lotion provided is really moisturizing and awesome.    The property is relatively small - I believe there are only 243 rooms, so no huge boxy mega resort ""architecture"" here, but individual bungalows so it feels more like you're in a neighborhood, not a sardine can like some hotels. All the rooms have a view of either the pools, the golf course, or if you're really lucky, the ocean!    One thing I love about this property is that there are discreet little laundry rooms scattered throughout. Every time I show up, the porters seem shocked that we have only one small suitcase for two people, but packing light is sure easier when you can do laundry every few days!    FOOD - The breakfast buffet at 'Ulu is so amazing that even after we checked into another hotel after our stay (and breakfast there was FREE!), we returned TWICE for breakfast here. Everything is fresh, nothing sits around too long, there's all kinds of great tropical fruit, you can try lots of different 100% Kona coffees from different nearby farms, and there are different fresh-pressed juices of the day, like cucumber-apple-beet for example (yum!). There's always miso soup with tofu and Japanese pickles and steamed rice, which I really love having for breakfast. If you're not going with the healthy option, though, there are platters of crispy bacon and sausage, pancakes waffles and french toast you can indulge in. There are made-to-order omelets/eggs if you'd like, fresh malasadas and mac nut sticky buns, and the best view you'll ever have for breakfast - you're basically sitting steps away from the beach. If you visit in February or March, you'll see whales out in the water jumping around while you eat, too.    For dinner, 'Ulu has a sushi bar (though you can order from the normal menu or the sushi menu anywhere you sit) as well as the full menu of mainly local stuff. Every Saturday night there's a farm-to-table dinner ($95 per person + another $55 if you want the wine pairings) which I really enjoyed. It beings with a cocktail and appetizers reception by the fire pit at 'Ulu while the sun sets - really beautiful! I actually thought the food was significantly better than the ""regular"" dinner we had at 'Ulu another time during our stay.    Beach Tree restaurant is good, too - there's lots of fresh pasta and local fish options, and the pizzas are great. Try the wild boar pizza.    GYM  Hualalai's gym is really great compared to other hotels I've stayed at - they have top of the line Precor equipment, too. Treadmills, ellipticals, stepmills, rowing machines, stationary bikes, a spinning gym, and a lap pool which I hardly ever saw anyone swimming in. (To be fair, every time I go, I tell myself I'm going to swim laps in the lap pool and I never have..) The gym equipment is in good shape, too, and there are plenty of mats for stretching/yoga/whatever. There's a nice set of free weights, too. The awesome gym setup really sets this place apart from other hotels in the area. There's a spa next door, too, but I haven't partaken in any spa treatments or massages or anything. There are also classes offered every day - I did a yoga class one day, which was pretty nice. Classes are $20 per person, per class.    POOLS  The pools here are crazy! I've already mentioned the lap pool at the gym. In addition to that, there's an adult/quiet pool (beach tree), a swim up bar pool (palm grove), a family pool (sea shell - actually had a separate shallow pool for younger kids), and a pool that's actually got fish swimming around in it that you can go snorkeling in (King's pond). In addition to all that, there's a swimming beach in front of 'Ulu with a kind of man-made seawall so you don't get swept out to sea :) I think most people just end up going with whatever pool is closest to their room, but",Mar 2014,March 2014,Traveled as a couple,"Downstairs rooms have an outdoor shower, but upstairs rooms tend to have better views.

197077682,50,Worth the splurge...even if just for one night.,"My husband and I spent 3 nights of our babymoon here, and the other 4 nights at the Fairmont Orchid. There really is no debate on which property we enjoyed more, and for the difference in price, it was a no-brainer. If you can only afford to stay here one night, try to make it happen.    They have a 'snack shop' by the spa and tennis courts where you can get a killer breakfast burrito and banana cup smoothie for breakfast at a very affordable price. The other restaurants are, of course, fantastic, but more expensive. They were the same prices as the Fairmont Orchid though if that's any consolation. The breakfast buffet is way overpriced, but pretty phenomenal, so worth checking out one day if you stay for more than one.    The beaches were a little lackluster, and rather windy, but the pools more than made up for it. Feeding the sting ray was awesome, I recommend trying it out -- they offer it every day.    The spa is likely the nicest one I've ever been to, and you can access the gym/sauna/whirlpools without getting a spa treatment. Worth going to just check out the Eucalyptus steam room (this cured my husband's cold).    All in all, the hotel exceeded every expectation, and will rank in the top 3 hotels we've ever been to. It MADE the trip, and is what I will always remember when I think about our last trip before the baby arrived. We will go back, just to stay at this hotel, only next time, I'll look to see what time of year is most affordable (Sept-Nov) and plan the trip around that to save a little money.

196660872,50,Second Times a Charm and it wont be the last,"This was my second time at Hualalai and it somehow was better than the first. Everything was perfect, from the reception, to the cleanliness of the room, to the friendly staff and the food. When you stay at a place like this is makes you want to change all your touring plans and just sit and enjoy this magnificent resort. I had a ocean view room on the first floor which allowed me quick access (literally steps) to the adult pool, which has an amazing view of the ocean. I left my sliding doors open at night and could hear the crashing waves, nothing more peaceful. I dont know where they find their people, or how they train them, but everyone I encountered from the turn down service person to the bartenders at Beach Tree, they are uniformly friendly and helpful. In fact, when I first got there I decided I wanted to try an find my room on my own and initially refused the golf cart to the room. I hate to admit it but I got a little lost and the person delivering room service stopped his cart and offered to take me to my room (which I agreed to). This was the first time I used their spa services and they were top notch. This resort is also perfectly situated for watching the sunset, whether on the beach or at their beachfront restaurants, the view is simply amazing. If you are staying there, check the sunset time and plan at least one day to view this, you wont regret it.    It is also important to note how clean the room was, as well as every other part of the resort. This is my number one priority when traveling and this place is so clean it seems almost brand new. Also, they have the most comfortable beds Ive every slept on at any resort.    Hualalai was so tremendous we are already planning another trip back.    The only downside to this property, which others have mentioned, but it bares repeating, is that although it is very beautiful and close, the beach is simply just not swim friendly, especially if you have kids.

196483050,50,Top Shelf Resort,"Beautiful place with excellent staff and service. One drawback if you love the beach is this is a predominately ""pool"" place as in four different quads around the pools with one fairly small ocean bathing area carved out of the lava. You pretty much need surf sandals/shoes to avoid the coral strewn bottom. Some sandy areas, but you have to pick your way. The lower floor rooms with outdoor showers are great. The staff is uniformly friendly and accomodating. We were at a conference which was nicely conducted with the facilities and on premises events with the exception of the luau which had ""anything-but-Hawaiian-traditional"" mundane food. Diet night. We stayed at the King's Pond area with a nice private lanai despite the first floor room. Highly recommend that area. The adult pool at Palm Grove was the nicest, followed by adult Beach Tree. The Seashell pool was loaded with the usual packed with kids hot tub area and the usual noise level. King's Pond is really for snorkeling only. The Golf Course was excellent and fun to play. There was a nice place for morning coffee/espresso/light bakery etc at Hualai Coffee shop. Ulu Grill was good upscale, Beach Tree bar was nice, with the usual beach selection type good, not great menu. We liked the Residence Bar and Grill the best. Quiet, right on the beach, nice beach bar, and solid traditional menu, limited but good. Compliments again to the always affable staff. PS buy your suntan lotion elsewhere-$26 a bottle for spray lotion at the beach services place is in outer space somewhere. (As in $10 at Walgreens).

All of the staff were helpful and accommodating. The rooms were clean and well appointed. There is so much to see and do at this resort that you won't want to leave and explore the surrounding area, but you are encouraged to do just that-explore. There are 5-6 pools and several beach access areas. There is also an adult pool to get away from all the kids for a while. The best pool was the Kings Pool! It is a natural spring/ocean feed pool with a large variety of tropical fish and an Eagle Ray. You can borrow a snorkle and fins and snorkle in this pool. This is a great experience for young children, older adults, and anyone who is either afraid of the open ocean or get sea sick bobbing up and down while snorkling. Also, take your snorkle and fins out to the ocean swim area. In this small areas we saw many different tropical fish and turtles. The Spa and fitness areas lacked the Four Seasons touch. I was a bit dissapointing in the fiteness area but I think that the spa is run by a different company. Best kept secret at this resort is the Residental beachside restaurant.

It was an upstairs one and had a great view! Pay a bit more - it seemed like other rooms were far back from the water and might have no view at all - kind of cottage / camp zone.",Mar 2014,February 2014,Traveled as a couple,Book water view - totally worth it.

195707059,50,Great Resort,This is another great Four Seasons resort. We stayed the week prior to Valentines Day and we selected the Romance package with a cooking class. This is not something we would normally select but we decided to give it a try and it was really fantastic. I would suggest that if you pick this option that you do not eat prior to the class and you do not need to eat after since you will eat everything you cook which is truly great food. We purchased breakfast from the snack bar each morning by the tennis courts and the store and we also picked up some snacks from the store. We had room service and found it to be very good and actually quite reasonable for the Four Seasons. We ate in almost every restaurant on the property and liked each one. The staff are extremely friendly and always willing to go out of their way to accommodate. Finally there is free Wi-Fi which is something that always bothered me when paying so much for a room. The swimming beach is small but there are pools with plenty of room. We rented the paddle boards and if you rent at the beginning of your trip you can use them for free for the rest of your trip. At the other Four Seasons we have been to the hotel owned the paddle boards etc. so they were complementary but this one is not owned by the hotel. They do however have training and everyone is very nice and helpful. The rooms are outstanding and we hesitated to ever leave the resort but we did take a helicopter tour to the volcano. We stayed on the ground level and like being able to leave our room and walk right out to the beach but people on the top level liked the view so it is a toss up.,Feb 2014,February 2014,Traveled as a couple,,Los Angeles
195598686,50,"A very spiritual experience, in this island of Hawaii were you can really listen to Mother Earth´s beat!!","To fully understand the spirituality that can be experienced in this place, you also have to consider the island on which Four Seasons Hualalai is located. This earth-bound feeling is very soothing and gives a sense of belonging, a sense of peace, a sense of true emotional and physical recovering. The hotel has taken these natural forces and has blended them with modern comfort, but somehow, Hualalai has carefully managed not to block this strong beat of Mother Earth. I enjoy travelling quite a lot, but in very few places have I felt so well, from the inside - out! The staff is committed to a warm and friendly service, with genuine smiles. The cuisine reflects the importance of organic food and locally grown food. And of course, I was blessed with a room right in front of the ocean, with huge turtles visiting the shore, and whales jumping and splashing at the horizon!",Feb 2014,February 2014,Traveled solo,Do try to book an ocean front room!,"Bogota, Colombia"
195488982,40,Amazing property and Excellent hotel. Depending on what you're looking for.,"Let me first begin by addressing the title of my review. If you're a younger couple, no kids, looking for a bit of an energetic vibe along with your relaxation, this may not be the right spot. Again, this is all based on personal opinion. This resort from my experience definitely has a health/relaxation theme, and the guests will skew somewhat older (no surprise given price), and therefore things get going pretty early. If that's what you are looking for, this place is a 10, hands down. If you are nitpicky (which I can be), I will say they do NOT have ALL the details covered.    Room: We stayed right by the adult pool, full ocean-view.  Positives: Room was fantastic, huge space, great view directly on the adults-only pool. Outdoor shower, space with table to dine outside, and literally a stones-throw from the pool.    ***Depending what client you are (family, couple), they will clearly place you in the appropriate section. We we really pleased to be by Palm Grove (adults-only pool)    Negatives: Closet layout is bad. It's a walk-in, but very limited shelf-space. Lots of hanging space, I guess depends what your wardrobe looks like.  Noise from above: The construction of the buildings is such that you can hear the footsteps of the people above you (at least I did). Also if the guests above move their outdoor furniture, without a doubt you will hear the noise. Depending on the hour, this can be annoying (ex: 6am)  Cleaning: Cleaning was good, but the schedule was not followed properly even though they give you 3 hour windows to select from when you arrive.    Facilities:  They have everything you could possibly imagine in the sports and health department. Indoor/outdoor machines, classes, lap pool, the works. I also thought the $25pp tennis pass was a nice value, as you could use the courts multiple times/day, even for an hour $25 is pretty good.    Property:  As with the facilities the property is immaculate and has a lot to offer. There are 4 pools, and it actually feels like many resorts in 1. Adult area, is tranquil and no kids are allowed. The main pool a little more bustling. The Kids area is filled with parents and kids having a blast. The pond is also tranquil and has 4000 fish and an eagle ray for your to snorkel with.    Ocean:  I noticed someone reviewed and said there wasn't great ocean access. While I can't disagree, there is an ocean swimming area that is totally accessible and I had a great swim (with a turtle to boot). If you wear swim shoes you're good to go, and it's a good size area, couldn't ask for much more.    Food:  As always FS food was fantastic, plenty on offer for all types of moods. I was surprised the sushi restaurant ULU didn't have more robust sushi offering, but it was great all the same. I also enjoyed the Residents Club, which is a bit off the beaten path, but a very enjoyable spot to grab a more relaxed meal. Lastly I was surprised there were not more juicing options, there was only 1 juice a day and the veg juice was sitting un-refrigerated by the buffet, which I thought was weird. The buffet has some great stuff, but was an 8 not a 10. Again given scale, not sure how they could do much better without risking quality.    Service:  Overall service was excellent. I would say that given the scale of the resort, the level was not necessarily up to snuff in certain areas, and there were unmemorable service aspects.  I did have a negative occurrence while at the resort, I won't go into specifics, however, it was dealt with adequately, albeit not in a super timely manner.    Location:  The physical area is amazing as I mentioned in the property section, and according to FS the Hualalai area has the best weather, which I can confirm. All around us we'd see dark rain clouds but over the resort it seemed to always be sunny, it was really something to marvel at. If you want to get out and go see other stuff, it's not terribly difficult but the resort is 20mins from either resort area. The goal here is to keep you sticking around, and there is plenty to do on resort. The airport is conveniently located about 10 minutes away.    Overall:  Amazing place, but make sure you know what you are looking for. If it's family trip, or just a place to focus on health/fitness and relaxation, you'll enjoy this resort immensely, and feel your money was well spent. I could see how some would debate the value proposition here, hard not to @ 1k/night minimum.... but the place is completely full, I'm guessing they could charge more and it wouldn't matter.    I'll add again that if you are looking for a boutique like experience as far as the property, service, and even the buffet to a certain extent, this is not going to suit you. It's a rather large resort with lots of things going on, they can't really customize the experience.",Feb 2014,February 2014,Traveled as a couple,"If you're a couple with no kids you must request the Palm Grove area, if not the Beach Tree...","New York City, New York"
195382600,30,Not worth $3K per day - even if we were old or had kids,"I have no idea why you would stay here unless you had kids to entertain/distract and/or were too old to enjoy anything real about Hawaii.    There is no swimmable sandy beach - several great pools - just like resorts NOT on islands. It is on the coast, of course, but a rocky, lava-y coast that is rather treacherous.    There are tons of things to do - just like resorts all over - and there are water activities to pay extra for but you can't really go swim in the ocean that beckons.    Our room was never made up before 4 p.m. - despite requests otherwise - so service is inconsistent - and it's expensive as you may have noticed.    And it's dead at 8 p.m - no nightlife - no pools open - no nothing.    It may be THAT much better than the other resorts surrounding it - we didn't check - but I suspect unless you like knowing you are at the fanciest place possible (and like others knowing it was well) and have kids or are too old to have kids or to walk on uneven surfaces...then I would recommend other options on the island.    [Admission: we are NOT resort people in general and were just staying there for a few days before we could go to our rental house. If there were a sandy, swimmable beach that was rather kick-@$$, I'd go 4 stars (or circles or whatever) - but for the price, I wouldn't understand 5 ever.]",Feb 2014,February 2014,Traveled as a couple,Go to another resort.,"Aspen, Colorado"
195350933,50,Beautiful place and wonderful service,"We just returned from a week stay at the incredible Four Seasons Resort Hualalai at Historic Ka'upulehu. We actually rented one of the residences which I recommend for larger families. I have three children (ages 5, 8 and 10) and we met my parents and uncle and aunt, who live in SF. We flew a long way from Boston, but it was well worth it. First off, we were met by the Four Seasons at Kona airport. We were quickly shuttled to the rented house and met by yet another employee who showed us around the very wonderful house. It was a three bedroom house with a guest house with another bedroom and bathroom. It was impeccably clean and had everything we might have needed including an infinity pool and outdoor showers for every bathroom. They had also provided grocery list prior to our arrival and everything I had asked for was there. The house also included two golf carts which we used daily to drive down to the main Four Seasons resort. The fitness facilities are incredible. The machines are top of the line, there were classes however we never took any of them. There is a little ""Trading Post"" that has amenities, food, wine and sundries. There are two pools. One mainly for families and the other for adults only. The seats however are hard to come by. You have to get down there pretty early to get decent ones. The beach is alright. It is very rocky however a big highlight was seeing huge turtles lying on the rocks, basking in the sun. It is the Four Seasons, so it certainly isn't cheap. One glass of wine down at the pool was $17 and most sandwiches were over $25 which is somewhat ridiculous. You'd think they might give some more range of options. The service is very good and the concierge was extremely helpful. One day it rained and we didn't want to be cooped up in the house, so I called the concierge and within 10 minutes I had a rental car! All I had to do was get to the front desk and fill out the necessary forms. All the restaurants were great. We especially liked the Beach House which is primarily for residents and golf members but if you call after 3pm you can sometimes get a reservation. It was smack down on the beach and the food was incredible. The sunset was perfect and the kids loved to play on the beach while the adults enjoyed our drinks. One thing I have to complain about is the room service if you rent a house. They have it, but they don't deliver which seemed strange to me as there were at least 7 people working at the front desk/valet area. One of us had to drive down to the lobby to pick it up. I would think that with what you are paying, they would have food delivery for the houses. Finally, our last day was made even more perfect when we were told that we could stay in the house until 8:30pm (we had a 10:30 red eye back). This made it so much easier with the three kids. All in all, it was a near perfect vacation and even if it is a far trip for us, I would do it again.",Feb 2014,February 2014,Traveled with family,,"Boston, Massachusetts"

195132111,50,Perfect ending to a great vacation.,"We divided our 12 day vacation on the Big Island between three resorts. The rainforest in the Volcano Village lodge, the Mauna Kea for its white sandy beach, and last but not least the wonderful Four Seasons resort well known for its amazing property and excellent service.  We enjoyed a great upgrade to an ocean front suite (2911) with very large lanai overlooking the adult pool in the Palm Grove crescent. Very quiet and peaceful. We liked the second floor, it seemed just a little bit more private and offered a great view of the pool and the ocean. We could see the whales from the balcony. We had four restful nights at the resort, loved the beautiful landscaping, especially after driving around the Island and seeing the barren ground all around.The days were perfect too, this is a perfect oasis, offering every comfort imaginable. We divided our time between the adult pool in the Palm Grove,( less than 30 loungers, so they are pretty strict about your comings and goings) and the Beach Tree quiet pool. More chairs there, same rules. The loungers on the sand facing the ocean were plentiful and we retreated there later in the afternoon for a change in scenery. We never felt the same pressure here competing for seats as we did last year in Four Seasons in Maui. We had a nice leisurely buffet breakfast every morning. I especially loved the raspberries and blueberries. Special thanks to Hauoli for making us feel so welcome.  On our last night, walking back from dinner, we encountered an astronomy expert with a huge telescope standing on the beach in the dark. We lined up to get a glimpse of the planet Saturn. First time for me to see another planet and so it was pretty special!  Besides having the breakfast at the Ulu restaurant every morning, we had our first and last dinner there too. We also had dinner at the Beach Tree. We only left the resort for dinner once and had a nice sunset dinner in Kona (Huggos).  It was our pleasure to meet with Gabriela and reminisce about Prague.

194873947,50,Paradise in Paradise!,"We were ""unexpected guests"" at the beautiful Four Seasons Resort at Hualalai, but you would have never known our reservation wasn't made months in advance. (See my review ""We walked away from Waikoloa""). Our family was beyond delight when the reservation agent personally welcomed us in the lobby. Greeting us by name … she adorned our family with traditional leis. Sitting to review our stay, a lovely wooden tray was presented with chilled hand towels, and baby coconut shells filled with mai tais and a tropical juice for our son! What a special way to start our vacation!    Lush greenery and flowers fill the grounds. Rooms are deftly tucked into the environment to keep them from intruding on the beauty of the area. Our eight year old was completely tickled seeing his bed … a small child's robe, Four Season's stuffed turtle, and fun pool toy were all laid out to welcome his arrival. His delight turned ecstatic, when he looked in the bathroom of our two-room suite to find his name and ""Aloha"" drawn with tub crayons among a school of brightly colored fish! :)    Our rooms huge sliding doors opened on to a lovely ocean front lanai … table and chairs, plus a cozy outdoor sofa, were a welcome spot to read the paper or linger in the evening. The master bath had all the amenities we could want, plus a special second, completely private shower outside!    Everything from the staff, grounds, beach, restaurants, amenities and pools were beyond our expectations! So many water options … family pool, quiet pool, adult-only pool, small tots pool, sea water lagoon (great for snorkeling and paddling about … plus an eagle ray you can feed). All the areas had plenty of comfortable lounge chairs, and the shade canopy chairs on the beach had no ""per hour or per day fees"".    Every employee wanted to make sure our days lounging in the sun were completely relaxing. Glasses were constantly replenished with ice water, and additional beverages or lunch at the pool or beach, was always delicious and delivered quickly. Refreshing little ""complimentary surprises"" were always being offered by the friendly staff … one day it was cups of frozen grapes, on another, ice cream bites … and yet another, fruity freezer pops. The hotel even had staff strolling around who would happily clean your sunglasses!    Fun at the Four Seasons didn't end when the sun went down. One night, the hotel provided an astronomy expert to share glimpses of the moons of Jupiter through his huge telescope on the beach. On another night, we roasted marshmallows and made smores with our son around a bonfire! Both experiences were complimentary, and just another way the Four Seasons made us feel like special guests.    Our (we hope he realizes how fortunate he is) eight year old son, equally enjoyed his experience at the Four Seasons right alongside his parents! The hotel offers a very fun and entertaining ""Kids for all Seasons"" program that we could have enrolled him in … however, he was completely content to enjoy the infinity family pool, watch the sea turtles rest in the sun, snorkeling in the lagoon, and play with some fellow 2nd grade boys who were also staying at the hotel.    Despite the fact that the hotel was full … there was a mix of families with kids of all ages … as well as couples of all ages. The hotel and the grounds never never seemed loud or chaotic. It was like staying with friends ""at a very large private ocean home"" … you had your own space and relaxation and fun was easy to come by for all.    I could truly continue to write about every little detail of our special stay at this hotel, but it seems more appropriate to just say … my husband and I have stayed in many fine hotels throughout the world in our 20+ years of travel … but the Four Seasons at Hualalai is now our top of the list ""wow"" wonderful place to stay!

The staff is incredibly accommodating, allowing us to drop our bags off in the early morning, prior to a boating excursion and then allowing us to check-in 30 minutes early because I had a conference call scheduled at 3PM, which is check-in time. When we checked-in we were informed that we had been upgraded to a suite, the location of which was so spectacular that we ordered all of our meals through room service and ate all of our meals on our spacious lanai, overlooking the ocean - we had the best seat in the house for every meal!

For example when we arrived (at 3:00am to our body clocks), there was no rollaway bed for our son in the room. We waited 20 minutes and then were told it would be another 15 minutes if I wanted the bedrails that I had requested - this was despite several confirmations from the hotel including from the desk clerk upon check-in that the bed was in our room. The grounds and facilities are lovely and attendants very friendly. Food at beach tree is not good and service lacks. Concierge was not very knowledgeable and gave bad directions to a local park/playground. The beds desperately need upgrading - they are soft and have a hill in the center.

192990069,50,Amazing honeymoon location: We stayed for 5 days and nights and were pampered constantly throughout our stay.,"We went to the Four Seasons on the Big Island, Kona for our honeymoon (January 21-26). We had an amazing time! We were greeted with leis when we walked into the reception building, as well as a non-alcoholic Mai Tai. Soon, we were greeted by Edwin, who took us on a tour of the grounds on the way to our room. Edwin was extremely friendly and knowledgeable. When we entered our room, there was a chocolate boat filled with all sorts of chocolates. There was even a bottle of champagne on ice waiting as well. Four Seasons also sent other little treat along the week, which were very sweet and special.    The room was beautiful! We had a great patio with a view of the adult pool and ocean. We were impressed with the outdoor shower too, which you had access to through the regular bathroom shower. I am very particular to cleanliness in a hotel, and I couldn't find anything that wasn't perfectly clean.    All of our meals were outstanding. We tried every restaurant on the grounds. You must check out the sunset one night at the Beach Tree restaurant or the Ula restaurant. Our pictures are amazing!    Be sure to visit the concierge when you first arrive! We chose the Blue Helicopter group to take a tour of the whole island. We did the more expensive tour to see the active volcanoes and the various waterfalls. This is a must!! Our pictures are beautiful!! We also went on a ziplining experience, and it was extremely professional and very safe. You go over several waterfalls, which are breathtaking. Lastly, we did a Lomi Lomi massage (duet), which was a great way to decompress after our wedding.    We will definitely be back again!! Four Seasons does not leave anything out. They know how to pamper you. Every staff member is friendly, professional and attentive. We loved Katie and Ashley at the adult pool!

The resort is gorgeous, with beautiful gardens and fitting max two storey buildings. We had booked again ""oceanfront"" and got a very nice room, unfortunately near the kitchen of the room service so that we suffered from the constant smell which was really annoying. Another negative point was the extremely noisy lady from housekeeping: Furniture was pushed to and fro, doors were closed with a bang ect.  The staff in general is friendly and helpful. The pools are very nice each in its own way, we preferred the quiet pool, for adults only. The service here was also perfect. The beach bar was our favorite place to watch the sunset.

From the first moment we arrived we received remarkable service, from all the staff, both warmly personal and genuinely professional. We also truly valued the amazing care given to the grounds, buildings and the landscaping.    I am particularly sensitive to hotels that seem somewhat tired, big and impersonal. The Four Season Hualalai was fresh and alive, with staff and guests who really enjoyed being there!    We stayed in the ocean front Kaiulani Suite, incredibly spacious with such uplifting, yet casually elegant decor. The intimate view of the waves as they rolled into shore, illuminated each evening, was breathtaking… ""the best view in the house""!

191834645,50,Believe the Reviews - This Resort Lives Up to the Hype,"We’ve just returned from 8 nights at the Four Seasons Hualalai. This was our first time to the big Island and the trip was booked to celebrate our 10th anniversary. We flew into Honolulu and had the first 4 nights at the Halekulani. We tried to book into Hualalai from the 3rd of Jan but even booking a year in advance we were only able to get accommodation from the 5th – which I believe is the last day of their official festive season.    We had originally booked to stay for 4 nights and then move onto FS Maui for another 4 nights. Within half an hour of arriving at the resort I knew 4 days just wouldn’t be enough. I duly contacted our agent who was able to cancel Maui and extend Hualalai.    Here’s a run down of our experiences and impressions:    Room  I was unsure of which crescent to choose – I was torn between the Beach Tree crescent and Palm Grove. Our agent highly recommended Palm Grove and I’m so glad he did. It feels like a slightly smaller crescent than the others but I don’t know if that’s actually the case. It’s certainly quieter and more private. This is also the crescent that houses the tranquility pool/adults only pool. We opted for an ocean view room which means it’s on the lower level. I actually really liked the lower level room (and not for the outdoor shower which I don’t particularly enjoy) but for the ease of the dual access from the room by either the front door or the lanai – the latter has you by the pool or the beach within a minute of leaving your room. Our room, which was on the right arm of the crescent, had good ocean views from both the bed and the lanai. One thing that surprised me was how little we used the lanai and the room, making the view a bit of a non-factor. Just about everywhere you eat, drink and swim here has amazing ocean views so enjoying it from the room wasn’t a big deal, so next time I would probably opt for a partial ocean view instead. The room itself is large and well thought out with just the right amount of a Hawaiian theme without going overboard.    Restaurants  We tried all of them and our favourite was hands down the Beach Tree. The menu is diverse enough to eat here for a week without getting bored. Fantastic burgers/pizzas and one of the best gnocchi’s with oxtail ragu I’ve ever eaten. The chef is Italian and the food is cooked with love and care. I also think that prices are actually very reasonable and far less expensive (not to mention better quality) than anywhere we dined in Honolulu. The other thing we loved of an evening was sitting around the bar at the Beach Tree for a couple of sun downers. Sitting at the bar, with the ocean just metres away and often with whales swimming by in the distance was truly magical. They have a very unique way of pricing the wine list at the Beach Tree which I thought was fantastic. Any wine can be purchased by the glass, the carafe or the bottle. They are pieced in categories with the bottle price being either $44, $66 or $88 and there are a good dozen bottles of red and white wines in each price category.  We ate at Ulu twice and whilst it was good it wasn’t great – lovely location and views though so it was nice to change up the dining experiences a little.    The restaurant which surprised me the most was the Hualalai Grill which is their steak restaurant. My husband, a New Yorker and very fussy re steakhouses, was dubious about trying this but we were both really amazed at the quality of the steaks – they were really good. It is however one of the only venues that doesn’t have water views and the atmosphere wasn’t as buzzy as the other restaurants so we just ate here the one time.    Service  In a word, exemplary. From the bars, to the breakfast staff, to the restaurants and in particular the poolside, the service was amazing. Friendly, efficient and totally on the ball. There was not a staff member that we didn’t enjoy speaking to. It says a a lot about a place when you see return guests going up to wait staff , hugging them hello and proceeding to ask after each others families and children. We witnessed this on a number of occasions and it speaks a lot to the staff and the guests here. The one area which I personally didn’t find great, and I know from other reviews that this is not the norm, is the concierge staff member who assisted us with dining reservations. I made sure to book all our dinners way in advance of arrival but as we extended our stay at the last minute we needed to make more dinner reservations. I spoke to the concierge but I was unable to get a table for the 7pm slot we prefer at either the Beach Tree or Ulu on any nights. We had to dine at either 5.30, 6.00 or 8.00pm as she insisted that the restaurants were fully committed. I made the bookings for the times available but on the previous day would go up to the actual restaurant to see if I could change the time to 7.00pm and was able to do so with no problem at all for each night - so that was a little strange.    Pools & The Dreaded Deck Chair Issue  On our first few days we sat around the tranquility pool/adults only pool. There are only about 24 chairs around this pool so it’s very peaceful and all the deck chairs face the ocean. On our first morning we headed out to the pool at around 8.30 am (we’re early risers) and there wasn’t a staff member around and no towels. The pool was actually roped off. We found out that it opens at 10.00 am. This was in some ways a welcome surprise from Waikiki where guests at the Halekulani were reserving deck chairs at 5.00am in the pitch dark (I kid you not). But 10.00am was a little bit the other extreme for us. We like to wake up early, have a run, shower and hit the pool at 8.30, read the papers and then head to breakfast at around 10.30. We then go back to our chairs and use them for the rest of the day, as we tend to skip lunch. At the adults only pool they were very strict about not reserving chairs for more than 15 minutes outside of 11.30-2.30 where you can leave them vacant. I admire that they enforce this and I wish other resorts would be as vigilant but when I explained to them that we wanted to go for breakfast at 10.30 and that we don’t do lunch so the 11.30-2.30 vacancy would not be required for us they were hesitant to agree and in the end we said that if anyone came after the chairs whilst we were at breakfast then they could give them away, luckily that didn’t happen. Don’t get me wrong I abhor it when people reserve chairs and then don’t turn up until hours later, have a quick dip in the pool and dry off and depart again. I dislike it even more when hotels let guests get away with that. But if you can see that the guest is using the chair throughout the entire day and is only absent for breakfast for 30 minutes it’s a different case. I noticed some people around the tranquility pool were very aware of the 15 minute rule. In one instance a gentleman sat in the pool keeping an eagle eye out for any one who was absent for 16 minutes at which time he pounced on the staff to remove them so he could take the chairs - the poor person had gone for a swim and then to the bathroom! For the rest of our stay we used the Beach Tree pool, which I preferred. Lots more chairs and the cabana’s (free) at the back give the best shade options for any time of the day. In general this is one of the only resorts we’ve been to a peak times where both the staff and the guests used good etiquette and were sensible re deck chair use. I wish other resorts would use the same good sense. We loved the fact that there was a kids pool which meant that even the Beach Tree pool, which has no age restrictions, was very quiet and peaceful and the children who did use it were incredibly well behaved.    In closing we had an amazing time at Four Season Hualalei. It’s a very special and unique property. I wasn’t sure what to expect – I’d read all the glowing reviews but wondered if it would live up to the hype and it absolutely did and then some. We can’t wait to return!",Jan 2014,January 2014,Traveled as a couple,,Sydney
191540592,50,Dream Honeymoon Fit For Royalty!,"My husband and I spent 11 days at the Four Seasons Hualalai and the best word to describe it is paradise. Our only regret is that we should have spent our entire 21 day honeymoon at this hotel. Instead we spent the remaining 10 days at the Four Seasons Maui, which is stunning but different.    The rooms are individual bungalows with a walk out. Ours overlooked the infinity pool and the ocean. Spectacular views, they left us speechless. Our room was huge, bathroom was well above average with a big glass shower, granite countertops, double sinks, huge soaker tub...just perfect.    The attendants at the pool would periodically come around and offer us a variety of snacks or services like cleaning our sun glasses, bringing us fresh towels, ice cream, freezies, sun block and water...amazing. There is even a quiet pool where cell phones are not allowed.    King's Pond Touch Tank is like a giant aquarium you can swim in with hundreds of different fish, even a stingray which you can feed! I believe it is an alkaline pool so it is a bit chilly but it is an ideal environment for the aquatic life. You can lounge around the pool and have drinks if you like. It is dark as it is suppose to resemble the ocean...it makes it very interesting.    Restaurants are out of this world. You can't go wrong with any of them. No negatives here at all. Don't get me started on the breakfast buffet, it is fit for the pickiest eater. We saw dolphins swim along a boat one morning. This place is magical.    There are giant turtles around the beach which you are not allowed to touch or approach. The beach is a natural beach which absolutely beautiful.    We rented a jeep and drove the road to Hanna and swam in a waterfall. The front desk will help you make the arrangements for a rental car and give you a map. We also drove to a dormant volcano and steam vents.    Hawaii is just extraordinary and there is no better way to enjoy it than by staying at this hotel.

Service is truly flawless, it does not get better than this: yes they offer water sprays at the pools, complimentary fruit kebabs at the pools and beach, they even professionally wipe your sunglasses. Everyone is super friendly and by day 2, absolutely everyone will know your name and will remember for example at which table you had breakfast or dinner. I found that impressive considering that the hotel was fully booked.  I was upgraded to beautiful suite overlooking King’s Pond and the Ocean..  The restaurants offer both postcard views and decadent food: Beach Tree House for dinner and sunset cocktails and Ulu for breakfast and fine dinner. Ulu uses mostly fresh ingredients sourced locally and the food is creative, tasty and well presented.  The concierge staff is one of the best in the world.  My favorite places at this resort:  • King’s Pond where one can swim and snorkel with 4,00 fish and an Eagle ray right inside the resort.  • Beach Tree pool: kept warm and with attendants constantly offering cold water, sprays, fruit, cleaning your sunglasses.  • The Beach: there were sea turtles at the time (though by law one has to keep a distance it’s a great experience).  • The Spa: One of the best in the world , with a great fitness center.  • Ulu Rest:  • The Beach Tree House at Sunset: cocktails and sunsets so spectacular they seem a live postcard.

But please don't let this put you off...  We chose FSH as our wedding venue as we wanted somewhere truly special and memorable for our most special of days. Of course, it did not disappoint.  As a guest of FSH you are treated quite simply as a VIP. The staff all wear ear pieces so they can seamlessly and subtly arrange anything you wish and communicate with other members of staff across the property to get any information they require. In practice this meant that when we arrived at the adults only pool in the morning and gave our name to the attendant, in the time it took the young lady setting up our sun loungers to go and get some towels for us, she also knew who we were, that we were getting married and was happily offering us a complimentary cocktail to celebrate... Staff know basically where you are whilst you are on the property but not in an intrusive way - one afternoon we went for a stroll and a young man was jogging round trying to find us just so he could ensure we had a complimentary drink! They also are great at giving you what you would like: when we booked a table for dinner and mentioned which table we might like to sit at, when we turned up later, we were indeed given our chosen table at exactly the time we wanted despite a very full house.  The key with FSH is that the service is pre-emptory. We rarely had to ask for something and wait for it to arrive. Usually we would return to our sun lounger or room to find that something we didn't even know we needed was there. We began to wonder at dinner if the tables were bugged because no sooner did the thought cross your mind that you needed something that a waiter appeared at your side... The only flaw in this theory was mostly we were just thinking something and not even voicing our wants/needs so unless they have mastered mind reading one can only conclude that they are just exceedingly good at what they do!  One morning I got up very early to enjoy the sunrise and to sit on the beach quietly with the turtles and I came across staff sweeping paths, mowing lawns and taking away any unsightly leaves and flowers that might be just past their best. It seemed to me the only thing I could liken this place to was a theme park: there are an army of people working to create an illusion for the benefit of the guest. My husband likened it to the Truman show for the same reason.  The truth is it's hard to review FSH because it has that elusive quality so hard to put your finger on - it was so good I don't know how to describe it succinctly.  The reason this review doesn't cover things that you might normally find in a hotel review is because this isn't like a normal hotel - it is pure escapism and if you stay here I am sure you will love every minute of it!",Jan 2014,September 2013,Traveled as a couple,All rooms here will be fabulous but stay where your budget allows.

190890962,50,The Happiest Place on Earth,"We stayed at the Four Seasons Hualalai for the last four nights of our honeymoon in November. We live on Maui. This is by far my favorite luxury hotel/resort I've ever been to. We were upgraded from a partial ocean view to a full ocean view room on King's Pond since it was our honeymoon. When we arrived at our room, we were greeted with champagne, an entire platter of gourmet chocolates and a note of congratulations from the GM. The property itself is impressive and immaculate. We really enjoyed the beautiful pools. Usually on vacations we are very active- hiking, diving, exploring but we just parked it at the resort. We never wanted to leave. I think what truly sets this resort apart from others is the level of service you experience. The staff goes out of their way to exceed your expectations. After a couple days, you feel like you are at home with family around that just keeps spoiling you rotten. I can't recommend this place enough. Another thing I want to call out is that the food at the restaurants on property is excellent. I hate it when you are captive at a luxury resort and they charge you offensive prices for mediocre food. The food at the onsite restaurants is delicious. We never had a bad meal. Also take advantage of the wonderful activities and amenities onsite. We took complimentary ukulele lessons, fed the spotted eagle ray in King's pond. I paid a modest fee to take a fitness class. It ended up being a private lesson since no one else showed and the instructor was awesome.

190878915,50,Excellent again,"This was our second time staying here for a week over Thanksgiving with our son, 2 years. Now he asks all the time ""when can we go back to that hotel on the beach with the turtles?"". I was not sure if it would be as good as our previous trip, but it was and now we are hooked.    This year we were at Kings Pond which was a great location. Our suite was fabulous, comfortable and spacious. I adore the room service breakfasts out on the lanai. I love the outdoor shower in the bathroom. I also appreciated that this year they started using a ""greener"" option for bathroom toiletries which were free of harmful chemicals and refillable. The powder room bath was also really nice with a shower- very masculine, my husband loved it. The grounds are so beautifully landscaped. They have a great gym and spa- about 2 min after you get on your machine someone comes around to give you water. My only complaint was the prenatal massage I got was only ok. I would have gone back a couple more times if it was great but it was really bad. I'm pregnant with a toddler and my back needed help. That said my husband got a sports deep tissue massage which he said was excellent. The spa itself is great though and I love the outdoor cabanas where you get your treatment done and the waterfall relaxation area.    The Thanksgiving buffet was delicious and so were all the dinners we had at Beach Tree and Ulu. Beach service was usually great although once the resort was full it was a lot slower and harder to track down the servers.

190340782,30,The good the bad and the ugly.,"I have stay numerous times at this resort and hence fell obligated to review it. This clearly is one of the premier resorts on the Big Island and the staff is typical Four Season excellent. Extremely friendly, courteous, and attentive. Food service and waite staff are top shelf, room service is excellent and does have, although limited, 24 service. The Beach Tree and Ulu restaurants, while pricey, are excellent. The chief, Nick, who has worked there for years is top notch and will hopefully remain there for years to come.  The rooms are spacious and the lower level rooms with outdoor showers should be request (JMHO). If you want to spring for the high end rooms right on the beach they are spectacular.    Why the average review you may ask. The beach as others have noted is not the typical large sandy beaches of hawaii. In fact ocean swimming is actually not safe except in the semi man made area near the center of the property. The pools are what you would expect from any high end resort, maybe even a little less than average. The childrens pool area is typically loaded with kids and can be loud as one may expect. There is a natural pool area (King's Pond) that is ""interesting"" if you like to snorkel but the water can be quite cold.  The neighboring resort which was the essentially distroyed by the tsunami several years ago is now basically an eyesore and is roped and fenced off. At one point even beach access is limited. This, to my opinion, use to be the nicer part of the local beach area.  The spa while beautiful is expensive to very expensive and the massages that I have had were average at best, not what you expect for the money.  The Grill restaurant at the 18th hole of the golf course has gone through several phases of management and types of food but has for some reason really never been good. The last time I was there it was mostly steaks and only average to less than average given the price. They need to do something there like a Happy Hour of some specials to bring people in.  Be also warned that if you stay at one of the local properties you are limited as to when you can make your restaurant reservations and even as to where you can sit at the pool and beach areas. This is dispite paying the daily resort fee. This was an annoyance to say the least. So much so that I will only now stay at the hotel.  All in all I still do recommend this resort and will return.",Jan 2014,December 2013,Traveled as a couple,,"Sausalito, CA"

Day 1 we got a late start and the only chairs we could get were on the beach. Our fault I understand. Then we had to move at 3:00 pm for a wedding. Day 2 I got up early and asked to get set up at the adult pool. I told the staff I had to get my wife and I would be back in 20 to 30 minutes. The attendant told me she could not save my two chairs it is first come first serve. There were six chairs that had been set up and people left. I talked to the manager at the pool she gave a weak explanation. I called the head of the department and he told me he would check into it. Surprise, we never heard back.    I am really disappointed. We ended up getting a seat at the family pool. The experience has tarnished my opinion of FS. I really wanted to make this an annual stop on our Hawaii trip. The pool staff could learn a thing or two from the staff at FS maui.    Disappointed",Jan 2014,January 2014,Traveled as a couple,,"Naperville, Illinois"
190085157,40,A Beautiful Hawaii Resort,"The Four Seasons Hualalai is one of the top hotels in the world, and one only needs to tersely glance at other reviews both here on Trip Advisor and other sites to figure that out. The grounds are spectacular, the rooms are world class (ones on the first floor feature outdoor showers that are both unique and fun), and the location at Northern Kona is among the prettiest settings of any resort in Hawaii.    But what bothered me about the hotel (and why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5) are some small details –especially considering the price tag of the rooms (in our case, nearly $1500 a night for a room, not suite, though it was during their “festive season”). Specifically:    1) The hotel charges $18 – $25 a person to take their fitness classes, of which there aren't that many per day (maybe 7 with some being super early in the morning such as 6 AM spin class). Given the price of the rooms, I see absolutely no reason why these classes shouldn't be complimentary for hotel guests, and have more of them offered per day.  2) There are two speeds of internet available to hotel guests – super slow (less than 1 MB down) which is free for 2 devices per room, or a faster service which costs $20 per day for 4 devices. With rooms as expensive as they are at the Four Seasons Hualalai, I think the faster internet should be free for all guests.  3) Some of the service in the hotel was a bit lackadaisical. For example, when we checked in our requested room type wasn't available. Since it would be available the next night, arrangements were made so that we could easily move from one room to another. Unfortunately, the front desk staff with whom we spoke with on multiple occasions to make those arrangements didn't write any of them down, so instead of the move being easy, it took up a large chunk of one of our vacation nights to sort it all out. In fairness to the hotel, when this was brought up to the attention of one of their top managers, he went out of his way to fix the issue.  4) The spa has a hard close of 8 PM, even if you’re getting a massage at 7 PM, which lets out at 7:50 PM. Typically, in top hotel spas such as the Four Seasons Hualalai, there’s a bit of wiggle time in kicking people out of the spa, especially if they just finished a service. Here though, at 8 PM on the dot an attendant informed me (nicely) that I had to get out of the steam room because they were closing.    In sum, everything I mentioned above could be EASILY fixed by the hotel, and if it was I’d change my review to a 5 without question. I also realize that the problems I mentioned are VERY small in the scheme of things. That said, considering the Four Seasons Hualalai’s room rates, the tolerance for small problems is not as great as I would have for other hotels.",Jan 2014,January 2014,Traveled with family,"First floor rooms have outdoor showers, try to get one of those if you can.","Marina del Rey, California"
189905930,50,DIED AND GONE TO H...ONEYMOON,"This review is about 10 months overdue. Trying to do this place justice, armed with only my words, is a daunting task. But I suppose that is the nature of some of the most beautiful things on earth; they're impervious to explanation.    MOKULELE AIR    Our stay began with a huge mistake. We tried to fly Mokulele airlines to Kona from Maui (where we had been staying at the Four Seasons). For anyone who isn't familiar with Mokulele, I'll tell you what anyone who has attempted to take the airline already knows; the plane never got off the ground and we only made it to Kona after buying extra tickets on Hawaiin Air. For the love of god, avoid Mokulele - one of the worst experiences of my life (I'll spare the details so as to save my self the anxiety of reliving the experience).    STACIE HOLI    The first chapter in our Hualalai experience: Stacie Holi - a member of the concierge team who felt more like our personal assistant the entire time we were there. She knew about our delay and our troubles with Mokulele. She arranged for us to be picked up at the airport (we never had to lift a bag), and had us immediately greeted with these awesome drinks in coconuts as soon as we arrived. We should have known right then and there that our troubles were over, and we were in for a treat. She had reached out a couple of days before to let us know that we hadn't made reservations at any restaurants, which were filling up. She did this on her own volition. She then said, ""not to worry,"" and basically planned out our entire stay within an hour. I could go on and on, but I'll just say that Stacie personally made our honeymoon the most memorable experience possible. I cannot thank her enough. Anyone can put a hotel on a beautiful piece of property and charge exorbitant fees to stay. But the staff at the Four Seasons make you feel personally welcome to be there; they anticipate your needs; alleviate your stress and remove all obstacles from your path to the most incredible experience possible.    THE HOTEL    Wow. The rooms are amazing (outdoor shower on the bottom floors) and are situated in villas that surround the major pools (for the most part) which are just short of the ocean. The rooms open right out to the pools and ocean. Because we were on our honeymoon, they put us outside the non-kids pool area, which I would highly recommend. The service at the pool is amazing. They swim out to you to take drink orders and deliver drinks, and come around with sunscreen, evian spray, sun glasses cleaner, and more. The facilities are also incredible. The gym, tennis facilities, spa and all of the nature surrounding the property are real treats. All in all, we could not have asked for a better place to spend the last 5 days of our honeymoon.    THE FOOD    Wow. Beach Tree was my favorite, but all of the restaurants on the resort are terrific. Beach tree delivers to the pools during the day. The nachos were some of the best I've ever had. Being that there are only 4 or 5 places on the resort to eat, you should try them all during your stay. You cant go wrong.    MISC.    Like everything else in life, the best things can come at a price. Hualalai is expensive. This was certainly a splurge for us. Roomss go for over $1,000 a night. I probably spent another $2-300 on meals and alcohol at the pool each day. But you have to let yourself go every once in a while if you can.    THE GOLF COURSE IS AMAZING! My wife was nice enough to let me sneak out for a round (while she went to the spa). It was practically empty. I rented clubs for $85 and the round was about $275 or $300. Worth the splurge. Impecable conditions and the layout takes you up into the hills on the front 9 and back down by the water for the back 9. The par 3 17th right into the ocean is an incredible signature hole (and my current desktop background). The nice thing about golf is they give you free replays on the same day. I had a 7am tee time, was done by 10 or 10:30am, spent the entire day at the pool with my wife and went back out at 5pm for an afternoon round. I got around 18 in about 2.5 hours which was perfectly timed for a back 9 at sunset over the water. Awesome.

Some are adult focused others for kids, even another for toddlers.    Service was first class, except for the odd one-off servers/waiters at the BeachTree Restaurant, who were not up to Four Season's standards. Sadly, this did spoil our experience during the holidays. Perhaps due to the busy 'festive' season, the stafff was pushed to their limits.    If you have not been to this property, I would advise you to go, take a chance, it has many attributes.

The breakfast was of high quality with good variety. Dinner at Ulu was excellent.  The downside - the service was inconsistent, wrong meals given, turned away from a restaurant before closing time because it suited the staff, lack of any personalisation. You couldn't help but feel you were a number and you were being processed.  Would I recommend the hotel - yes, it is great for families.

When we first entered the property, the guy at the booth at the top of the hill communicated with the hotel staff at the bottom of the hill to let them know our names (which we did not know until the bottom of the hill). Check in is so easy because they sit you down on a couch, give you a fresh flower lei, and a free drink. The resort is thoughtfully laid out with low rise buildings throughout. At first, it was a little surprising that every staff member said, ""aloha"" when you walked by. After a day or so, we appreciated this effort and really liked the kindness of every staff member (housekeepers, concierge, waitresses, maintenance, everybody!). Our suite was incredible -- it had three showers! There was an outdoor shower with orchid plants, a personal steam shower, and a regular shower.

No high rises or long corridors or big buildings but smaller bungalows set amongst the fauna and flowers and palms and rocks.  The beach is rocky and sometimes rough but it I wanted a great beach I would have chosen elsewhere. There was enough beach to swim. when the waves permitted, and enough pools to give variety.  Our room was not big, nor was the bath, but it was well laid out and gave me the feeling of not being at a standard issue four seasons. Even excellence can get boring.

189017256,50,The Perfect Family-Friendly or Romantic Getaway,"I have traveled many places and stayed in many resorts but Four Seasons Hualalai totally blew me away and it's the first place I have said we MUST COME BACK to!    Service: Extraordinary - you are always greeted by name and the staff always says ""aloha"" when passing you on the grounds. Every request was fulfilled within 10 minutes and even room service was efficient.    Accommodations: Amazing - I hate resorts where you feel stacked on top of other guests and the Four Seasons Hualalai manages to feel intimate, even with so many guests. Go for the ocean-view rooms. It's worth it.    Spa: To die for - outdoor jacuzzi, steam room, sauna and a unique stone stream that you can walk through for a foot massage. Our massage services weren't the best but the spa experience made up for it.    Restaurants: Hit or miss - This was the only place that could be improved. Some of our meals were awesome and some were so-so. I would be less critical if the price tag wasn't so steep.The only other problem is that dinner reservations were sometimes hard to come by at the times we wanted to eat so I'd recommend booking dinner reservations in advance or at the time of your arrival to make sure you can eat when you want. Otherwise, the room service is a great alternative.    Pools: Something for everyone - Our 3 year old loved the kiddie pools. They have one 3 feet deep and the other 1 1/2 with a sand bottom and sprinklers which kept her entertained for hours. There are also 2 adult pools and a pond for snorkeling with fish and an eagle ray.    Activities: Tons of options - Many of the activities including fish feeding and hula dancing class were free. Lots of fitness classes avail (but they run about $25/hour). We didn't make it to any ocean adventures but I'm sure they'd be amazing too. They also have a fantastic kids club with games, movies, and outings for the older kids.    Summary: THIS IS THE RESORT HOTEL EXPERIENCE I'VE EVER HAD.

I don't think there is a hotel that can exceed the experience we had at this paradise found. The service is unmatched by any hotel in which we've ever stayed.    POOLS:  There are pools for everyone, from those who wish for quiet, a pool for kids, a pool with a swim-up bar and even a naturally protected safe swimming ocean area (the ocean in this area is otherwise unsafe for entree/intermediate swimmers, as there are many lava shoals both above and below water). Servers are there before you even realize you were ready for an iced water, or an adult beverage. The sun loungers were quite comfortable and abundant (although during the busy season, we had to get there early (9 AM) to ensure seating poolside).    RESTAURANTS:  The restaurants were perfect. For the person with an unlimited budget, there is no better. If you're concerned about costs, go elsewhere; drinks ranged in price from $16-20. Meals ranged from $100-$200 a pop for two, but hey, again, the service is incredible. UlU offers a variety of sushi and seafood, and some items for the non seafood lover. The Beach Grill provided great healthy meals (kale, edamame, chia seed salad for instance) along with the standard but delish burger/pizza options. At night the Beach Grill had a lovely duo playing Hawaiian and soft rock which added to the romantic mood without being intrusive, if you were intent upon having a quiet conversation with your fellow diner/s. Special shout-out to Tyson at the Beach Grill for his thoughtful gesture (the Belly necklace is loved and worn daily!) and Hilary at the maitre d' desk for her warmth, humor and smarts).    FITNESS CENTER:  All I can say is Rip Oldmeadow: you rock. For special classes, including Spin and Boot Camp, no one can make me work harder. The Four Seasons and crew have created a healthy and happy workplace, thus attracting some of the greatest talent in the hospitality and fitness industry. Rip is an example of that: as a former Iron Man (5th fastest in the world) it was a treat to have him impart his knowledge and expertise in this beautiful studio. A variety of classes for all types, along with a fabulous fully equipped gym - we were pleased and used it daily.    CONCIERGE SERVICES:  We needed very little in the way of help here, but can only imagine that their support would have been sublime. At one point, we did require some office support (65 pages of documents were faxed and then neatly sorted and left for us in our room, worry free - no charge).

We had a large oceanfront suite, which was spacious and beautiful and right on the ocean. Highly, highly recommend ...    Highlights:  SERVICE ... every staff member we encountered from the general manager to the concierge to the housekeepers to the waitstaff was genuinely warm, pleasant and helpful. Folks appeared to enjoy their work and were responsive to requests and attentive without being oppressive. This was consistent throughout our stay and with each and every Four Seasons employee we interacted with.  FAMILY FRIENDLY ... this is a resort made for families. You will enjoy yourself too if you are traveling without kids (adult pool is on the opposite end of the resort as the kid-pool and kid-friendly ocean lagoon) but this place was especially great for our family vacation. The concierge was able to outfit our room prior to arrival with a crib, a playpen, a highchair, a bouncy chair, a baby bath, baby shampoo, a few baby toys, safety rails on the bed for the 4-year old, outlet covers, and even a child-sized kimono bathrobe, just like mom and dad's. The seashell pool (kid's pool) has pack-n'-plays available for use poolside as well as goggles and toys for the bigger kids. The family pool itself was pretty unremarkable, but the location and ocean views can't be beat, and it was full of happy children having fun. The resort also offers many fun activities for children and families, and a wonderful authentic family luau in a cool outdoor amphitheater. They also can arrange a reasonably-priced nanny.  LOCATION ... weather for us was perfect. High of 80 to 85, low of 70 to 75, pretty much every day of our visit. We had one windy afternoon, but even then it was warm and glorious. There is a great, protected swimming area with some easy and fantastic snorkeling. Also, there are tons of accessible tidepools and sea turtles all over the place. The resort feels secluded, but is about 10 minutes from the airport, and 15 minutes from groceries and a Target.  FACILITIES ... there was some damage from the Japanese earthquake and tsunami 2011 and some updates have been made. Overall, the place felt clean and modern without being so polished you're worried about getting sand on the floor.    There were just a few things that could have been different that would have made this trip perfect ... the 'kitchen' in the suite had a full-sized fridge, micro, coffeepot, etc., but literally no counter space for any kind of dishes or prep, and no stove-top. Washing bottles was challenging in the tiny sink. Also, did I mention everything was really expensive? REALLY expensive. I get it. It's the 4 Seasons. One shouldn't be surprised. But, I was surprised. The food at the restaurants was overall quite delicious for resort fare, but I don't like to eat at a restaurant every morning, noon and night, even when traveling.

188159362,50,Best hotel I've ever stayed at! Should've stayed longer! Great honeymoon!,"Hands down the nicest hotel I've ever stayed at in the world. We stayed here for the last 2 nights of our honeymoon. We should've stayed at least another night! Hotel upgraded us to a room with a better view for our honeymoon. Greeted us with mai tais served in a coconut at check in and some local nuts. Room was impeccable. We took the advice of other tripadvisor guests and got a room on the lower level of the bungalows so that it would include the outdoor volcanic shower. Very cool!    Dusty and Candace were the standout employees! Candace at the Beach Tree restaurant talked the kitchen into staying open to serve us dinner as we arrived late at the hotel on our first night and the kitchen had closed about 10 minutes earlier. She stayed late and gave us 5-star treatment. Dusty is one of the on-resort drivers who takes you around in the golf carts. We coincidentally had him drive us 2 or 3 times, including check out. He's a gem! Polite, friendly, smart! Dusty & Candace provided the type of extraordinary service that Four Seasons is known for.    I tried having a tennis clinic at the club at the resort. Unfortunately, between a miscommunication from the Concierge and the rude staff at the tennis resort, this didn't happen. I play a lot of tennis so this was going to be a bit of a treat, so it was very disappointing that it didn't pan out. I phoned the hotel before departing on the honeymoon and they said i didn't need to book in advance and could sign up in person; this wasn't really accurate.    On the other hand, we ended up taking a golf lesson from the head pro at the world-class golf course. This was money well spent. The head pro (can't remember name) was incredible! We could've listened to him all day long!    We tried the buffet breakfast one morning and it was excellent with tables right on the beach. Our last morning, we ordered room service. The staff set up everything on the outdoor terrace. They unfortunately forgot half the food and got one of the two main dishes wrong. But they fixed it soon enough. I felt bad having the server go back and have to fix it. But given the prices, was hard not to make sure we got the correct items.    Last but not least, we went twice to the gym and the spa. The gym was closed the first morning for repair. Understandable but surprising they couldn't fix it in the off hours. The spa was awesome! Hands down the best spa i've ever been to! Excellent service! Very expensive, but a great experience! A small gecko did end up in my food after the treatment though! This made for a great photo and i loved it, but I could imagine this being undesirable for others. I guess that's what happens when you have an amazing spa that happens to be outdoors on a tropical island.    We will return to this hotel hopefully sooner rather than later!

188011659,50,Unsurpassed in every way!!,"My wife and I just returned from a week at the FS Hualalai. We had such a wonderful overall experience. We typically travel to the FS Wailea every December for her birthday week, but this time decided to try Hualalai. It was spectacular. The setting of the hotel, the grounds and landscaping, and the rooms are phenomenal. We were upgraded to an ocean view room by the King's Pond. It was very quiet, and had a nice view of the pond and ocean from the lanai. It was on the bottom floor, so- as others have stated- was a little loud from the guests upstairs, and the view was not quite as nice as a second floor room, but it did have the outdoor shower which we used every day and really liked. We spent most days at the Beach Tree pool, which was great, but then discovered the Palm Grove (adults only) pool, which we preferred. The one thing we were very impressed with was the food- the ULU was fantastic- the regular menu items as well as the sushi--, and we also enjoyed the Beach Tree. The menu had a nice variety of dishes and everything we had was just delicious. There really was no need to leave the resort to eat. The breakfast buffet at ULU also was so good. We like to work out in the morning when we are on vacation, and the jogging trail and the fitness facility were great for this- it really was a bonus. Overall, this was one of the most amazing places we have stayed at. But to be fair and critically helpful, we will also mention the very minor things that could be improved upon.. One is the service at the pool- not always prompt, and the drinks served at the Beach Tree were not very good. A couple of days the jacuzzi at Beach Tree was luke warm/cool, but this was corrected. One night we ordered a pizza at the Beach tree and the chef forgot to put the toppings on it. The waitress brought out the missing toppings and told us we could just put them on top of the pizza at the table (?). One thing we knew when we booked, was that the beach was not really for swimming, and we saw this as a slight drawback. There is one small area where you can get in the water, but it is still a little rocky and it is a very confined area. We really like the beach at Wailea compared to this. But this is typical of the Big Island I suppose- rocky, volcanic coastlines- beautiful but not so conducive to swimming/snorkeling.

The professional service, the ambience, the quality of the rooms and the ability to just utterly relax was priceless. I have never before experienced resting on a lounger on the beach watch turtles also resting on the sand not more than 5 - 10 metres in front of you. Alternatively, grab a snorkel and flippers and spend a lazy hour exploring the pool that has hundreds of different types of fish including a stingray that you can swim alongside.  I do need to call out that during this week there were no children present. I have nothing against children (I have 2 of my own) but there has to be a lot said for having an entire week with no children around you which I know added a significant bonus to my experience.  Food was outstanding. Some of the best restaurant food I have eaten for a very long time. The highlight was the NY Prime crusted with coffee at Ulu Restaurant. The best steak I have ever eaten - period.  This was a magic week that will provide many moments of happy reflection for the remainder of my life.

While it wasn't our first choice to travel with a newborn, our company was holding a retreat and we didn't have much flexibility on the timing and were very hesistant about going.    No regrets now. First a shout out to Taylor or Tyler at the front desk - when we arrived they had us in a great room, but far from the kiddie pool area. I asked when I checked in if we could get a room change and they said they would look into it but never heard back. The next morning I spoke with Taylor and he made it a priority. By 11 AM, he had two options for us and made arrangements for us to be moved - even though his shift had already ended - he stuck around a bit to make sure we didn't transferred to someone else at the desk and have to start the process over. Our new room was perfect! it had a larger foyer which worked great for the strollers and changing table and we were very close to the pool and ocean.    The 'baby proofing' option was amazing. We had a crib, night stand, diaper genie, swim diapers, baby shampoo, stuffed animal (seal puppy) and even embroidered bibs for our little girls. We felt that not only did they accomodate children at the resort - they were genuinely welcomed - if not celebrated! One night, they had a hulu dancer who did a wonderful show during dinner at the Beach Tree. When she was nearly finished, she came over and talked to our two year old who was fascinated. Before we finished talking she left our two year old with a beautiful crown of flowers she had made and been wearing. Our daughter saw her a few days later during breakfast service and was really happy to see her 'friend'. The pool cabana had everything we needed to have fun in the ocean and pool for a two year old. The service at the beach was great. My wife was able to stay outside at the beach in complete shade, relative privacy entire afternoons - while being taken care of by very kind and attentive staff. Everytime an employee passed us, they gave us a warm ""aloha"". Our two year old was so pleased with all the warm greetings, that she immediately began tellinging everyone she saw at the resort ""hello-ha"" thinking that was how everyone said hello - and that you must say hello to everyone you saw.    Meals were good - we really enjoyed the breakfast buffet at Ulu and the hamburgers and onion rings at the Grill were the best we've ever had. We ate at all the restaurants and while prices were high, quality and portions were very adequate. My wife and I have stayed at several luxury resorts on the Hawaiian islands and this is a new favorite.

The beach at Hualalai is a small area that is essentially walled in by a (man-made?) reef-- although there are still lots of coral and rocks on the bottom and I cut my feet a few times. The pools are nice though, and comparable to Maui. The service may actually have been better here-- everyone was very friendly and attentive.    We also got an upgrade from a partial ocean front view behind the kids area to a full ocean front view behind the tranquility pool-- which was fantastic. The room was spacious, clean, with large hot tub, indoor and out door shower, high ceilings, and a veiw out to the ocean from our room. The food options weren't great, and I'd give the food 3 stars, and also it was very expensive. There was a good beach side smoothie place though.

Coming up on a big anniversary we decided to return. I have to admit, I was a little anxious as our first trip was beyond fantastic. Could the Four Seasons deliver the same quality again? Would the consistency be there in all categories? I'm happy to say it was!!!    The concierge did an excellent job of helping me secure a floral arrangement and cake for our anniversary night, as well as keeping track of our many (changing) dinner reservations and incoming packages. These ladies are on the ball!    I had a fantastic swimming lesson with Rita at the fitness center.    It was especially nice being remembered by staff like Grant at the Palm Grove pool and Chris at the water sports desk.    Being take care of by the pool attendants on a daily basis - Eric, Shawn, Cat and Katie - really made our vacation. I feel my husband finally mastered the art of relaxing and these people deserve much of the credit.    The food did not disappoint. All that ocean air just keeps you hungry and the resort delivers. Breakfasts at Ulu, lunches by the pool and dinners at Beach Tree - yes, we ate there 5 out of our 6 nights - we were happy and well fed. Teddy does a great job of managing that restaurant.    The shopping on property is to die for. I took a morning and browsed around - great offerings and wonderful staff.    I didn't get the chance to take a yoga class or climb the rock wall. Those will be on my ""to do"" list for our next visit. Also we didn't get into King's Pond this time around, but will definitely do next time.    And trust me...there will be many next times!    P.S. A final word about weather. The Four Seasons really knew what they were doing when they built this incredible property on this exact piece of land. You basically have 2 volcanoes shielding you from oncoming inclement weather. At one time during our stay, all the islands were being pounded with rain, but our little slice of paradise only had a light smattering during the evening. This particular piece of land gets the BEST weather in all the islands. 82-88 degrees year round, and if it does rain, it's only for a bit while the sun is still shining.

185382496,50,Probably the best Four Seasons resort on earth.,"Me and my family spent 6 nights in this resort. We are a family of three, and we booked an ocean view room. The whole experience was just amazing. We spent only one day out- to the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. When we arrived, the atmosphere was relaxing and tranquil. A true resort-like feeling. (The night before were spent at FS Maui, and FS Maui was more like a luxurious hotel than a resort.) We were driven to our room by a buggy. The room was big enough for three people with an extra bed. The indoor decor was Hawaiian style, which exceeded our anticipation. I recommend that if you want a room with real ocean view- book an oceanfront room at least. We could hardly see ocean from our lanai, but the view was not bad whatsoever-the room over looked a big, well-maintained lawn. The service was great, especially the concierge- right after we confirmed our car rental the night before our one-day trip to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, they asked us if we need any help. We said sure, and they took a map out, which was adorable, and started to help us on arranging our itinerary. We followed the route they recommended and had a wonderful day. Their concierge was extremely helpful and impressive.    Their restaurants were actually very good. We could see the Kona sunset every single day- it was indeed gorgeous. Bring up to there swimming pools- all of them were fantastic. The king's pond was the best of all- we went snorkeling in the pond three times during our stay! The Ka'upulehu culture center was unique. We learnt to play ukulele and their traditional dance, and the experience was unforgettable.    Overall, the whole experience was like an epic. Everything was managed so elaborately that made every detailed faultless. But I strongly suggested that they make the same housekeeper to clean the same room during the period of time when the same guests stay in a room for consecutive days.

The service was excellent overall and, when we encountered a hiccup at the spa, the hotel did go out of their way to make sure we felt everything was handled fairly (as an aside, I note that the Kona property's ""hot stone massage"" was more hot stone than massage and wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for much massage).    The unique design, which winds along the beachfront so that no room is too far away from the ocean, in a way that feels very Hawaii and close to nature (unlike many of the other 5* properties I've stayed at throughout the islands) is reason enough to visit-- but make sure to stay for the food. We had amazing meals, every meal, and really enjoyed watching the sunset from the sushi bar at ULU. Breakfasts at ULU were also worth writing home about, I'd love to get the recipe for their healthier take on eggs benedict. My husband loved that they brought local coffee producers to the property for breakfast so we could sample their brews.

184827917,50,"Beautiful Resort, Impeccable Service","No wonder why this place won a Traveler's Choice Award! The Four Seasons continues to impress us no matter how many resorts or times we visit.    This was our first trip to FS Hualalai, and a much needed trip since we had our first child. We were bringing him to make it a family vacation. We wanted to go somewhere tropical, but with the safety of U.S. This fit the bill perfectly. We booked through AMEX Fine Hotels and Resorts to take advantage of the complimentary continental breakfast, dining credit, and room upgrade.    I had called in ahead of time that we were bringing our little boy and needed a crib. They were happy to provide a complimentary crib, changing table and bath tub. They even asked if we needed a sound machine and baby monitors. We did ask about babysitting services, and though they didn't provide it directly from the resort, but used Malihini Keiki Care.    We checked in around one and were happily greeted by the valet staff with leis and a member of the front desk. He gave us fresh cool towels and Mai Tais. Our room wasn't quite ready but it was worth the wait. We were upgraded to the Ocean Front Room with Outdoor Lava Shower (#801), in front of King's Pond.    We checked in and were greeted to a pleasant surprise. The Four Seasons embroidered my son's name on a bib! As well as providing us some baby shampoo, lotion, and other goods, as well as a diaper genie. When we walked to the bathroom, the baby bathtub was already there, and the staff had drawn fish, turtles in bathtub.    The hotel is two stories tall, and every room has a lanai/balcony. There are three pools, one ""activity pool"" which is where the kids pool is, and one quiet pool, and one adults only pool with swim up bar (the chairs are almost always taken by 9am!). The adults pool have their own drink menu. There are four restaraunts, 'Ulu (which is where breakfast is served), Beach Tree (near the quiet pool), Hualalai grill, and Residents Beach House (which is open to hotel guests too). The spa, gym, sundries shop is off a little ways from the resort, but its a short walk. There is also snorkel area called King's Pond, which has their own Eagle ray and several species of fish.  The beach area is rather small and you can't really swim in the ocean there, due to the waves and rocks. But there is a swimmable area , where it is protected by rocks so you have a calm pool to swim in.    Also, sea turtles usually laze around the beach area in the afternoon and worth a look. Don't touch them as it's illegal to pester them.    The staff and service were impeccable. We were always happily greeted by name, and offered a ride to wherever we wanted. On the trip to the resort, I had forgot a piece of our stroller at home, which rendered it useless. I called the front desk, looking to rent a stroller, and they happily let us borrow a stroller they had around. The crib they provided us was nice, but the sides were too tall for my wife. We called the front desk again, and they happily exchanged it with a pack and play.    The pool service was the highlight of our trip. The hosts were easily located, and always checked in on us. We met Danny who greeted us everyday we were there, and Cat, who was very sweet. One day, we were at the pool, and it was nap time for our baby, so she helped bring out a pack and play to the pool, and pulled down the shades to the cabana. Another time, my wife and I were on the beach (sans baby), and Caitlyn, one of the pool managers said we can go the adult pool if we wanted to. We said all the chairs were probably taken, but she said she can call over there and reserve us two seats. Ashley, who was also great, was working there that day and took great care of us.    We went on several date nights by ourselves, and left the babysitting to Michiyo, a sitter from Malihini Keiki Care, took great care of our son.

184272583,40,"Pretty Great, just prefer Maui","My husband and I stayed at Four Seasons on the Big Island in October for vacation. We have stayed at Four Seasons Maui several times and loved it, but even the staff raved about the property on the Big Island.    We had reserved a room overlooking the golf course. When we checked in, they told us they were upgrading us to a room near the kids pool. We went and saw the room, and in our minds it was a worse location than what we had reserved. They weren't thrilled that we didn't like the so-called upgrade, but gave us the room we requested.    No doubt the property is beautiful. It definately is. But the beaches aren't swimmable since its so rocky and the weather on the Big Island is not as nice as on Maui.    Also, the service at Four Seasons Maui is better. The bartender at the Steak restaurant had a little bit of attitude. The food at the Beach House was great, and we had a server there who was terrific, but one server we had at the Beach House also had a bit of an attitude. And we ate at the Beach House virtually every night , except 1 when we went to the Steak House. Also at the Beach House, when we sat in the bar, it seemed to take an unusually long period of time before they'd bus the tables - ie when we sat down, and a previous party had just left.

183997290,30,Beautiful Hotel..As long as you're not looking for privacy,"After seeing the reviews on Tripadvisor and having it rated the #1 Hotel IN THE WORLD it was hard not to have high expectations of this hotel, and why shouldn't you? I have been to nine different four seasons and I'm almost never disappointed. This happens to be the 2nd most expensive property I've visited (after Florence, Italy) I simply cant understand how they built this property. Amazing views of the ocean. Their rooms however, were constructed in bungalows that are surrounding their four pools in a crescent shape. The problem is that all the walkways around the hotel are surrounding the bungalows. In the majority of rooms, if the person has their shutters open, you can clearly see everything (and everyone) in the room. My wife and I literally had to keep the shutters closed in the morning until we were completely dressed. The second floor rooms have bathroom windows overlooking the walkways to the lobby! I accidentally (I swear!) saw a few people showering as I was walking to the lobby because they didn't raise their blinds high enough. If you're out on the balcony, expect to have people walking right by your room unless you have a 2nd floor room, which may be recommended since you hear every footstep from the people on top if your on the 1st floor, but then again, you'll lose the outdoor shower, so its a dilemma! And that is the problem with this hotel. Is the hotel good? Yes. Is it great? NO I don't think so. And if I'm paying $250 a night for a room I could handle great. When I'm paying $1,000+ a night I expect fantastic, and I definitely did not receive that.  There were some service issues with the management as well, but nothing that would indicate a service problem in general with the hotel. One other issue that really left a bad taste in my mouth was that within 3 minutes of arriving at the hotel, the woman who was checking us in tried to sell us on a suite ""that's normally $2,000 a night for only $500 more a night."" I found that to be extremely distasteful. I have been to been four seasons and I've never been upselled on a room. I have however, been upgraded by management many times without asking, which, although not necessary, is one of the reasons I keep coming back to Four Seasons.",Nov 2013,November 2013,Traveled as a couple,Beware of Ocean views.

183777818,50,Is this Heaven? No..its' Hawaii.,"My wife and I recently spent the first leg of our Honeymoon at Hualalai in the beginning of October. I did a great deal of research in selecting the hotels and and based on the reviews I had a feeling we were in a for a real treat here on the Big Island with the Four Seasons, but I couldnt have imagine our introduction to the Four Seasons culture quite like this. Let me say that the resort is absolutely stunning...meticulously manicured and landscaped; the design incorporating the natural lay of the land with the lava rocks and native flora is outrageous. It's very strange b/c there is definitely a positive energy coming from the place..the resort feels like you're in a prehistoric jungle with all the amenities of the 21st century. The place is lit by tiki torches at night and you feel like youre on an episode of Survivor or Temptation Island! Haha    From the moment you step foot to the minute you leave you really do feel like you are part of their ""family"" and are a part of soemthing special. We were upgraded to an ocean-view room overlooking King's Pond which was perfect!! Spetacular pond and ocean view while still providing the privacy we desired. The room is very big w/ a littel lanai and we had the oudoor garden shower (def a MUST!) and earth-toned interior is very soothing.    The restaurants are all awesome as we at at all three. The Beach Tree pool and Serenty Pools are fantastic...the bar by the adults only Serenity Pool has its own herb garden which is used in making all the specialty drinks (think fresh blueberries and mint muttled in your blueberry mojito...goddamn it was good!)    The Spa was amazing we had a couples massage for an hour and it was pure heaven.. The gym/spa amenities were all stellar and now I know why its ranked as a top spa worldwide.    AND now, onto the SERVICE. All other hotels should send their staff here to see what service is all about. The housekeepers and groundscrew and everyone says ""Aloha"" with a smile and MEANS it...they truly love working here. The managment is the best Ive ever encountered and the completely bend over backwards and do thoughtful things to personlaize your stay. Example: shout out to Damon, the resort activities manager (the man!) -- there were alot of couples on their honeymoon while we were staying and he organized a Cocktail Hour Meet & Greet for all the couples!! So we got to meet some really nice people from all over the country and even made some new friends too! We also were invited to a Managers reception where we got interact with all the top managers of the resort...great meeting Florian (go Bayern!) -- people like him who are so friendly and really make the resort what it is b/c they genuinely value real live feedback and then implement it!    This leg of our trip stood out, far and above, the other islands (we did stay at FS Maui, but it wasnt even a comparison)..and our experience already has us planning a trip for one of our anniversaries. It is VERY expensive, but what you get in return far outweighs the monetary amount associated with it...memories to last a lfetime and will keep you coming back for more.

The kids loved the nanny so much, we invited her to come and watch the kids at one pool while we relaxed at another pool. This plan worked out very well. We had a great week. Some friends of ours had been to the Big Island before and told us to take the kids on a trip to Kaelakekaua Bay. We took the large, ""family friendly"" boat that offers a bbq lunch and lessons for beginners. It was an amazing day. Really glad we did that day trip. Worth the long drive into town. I can't say enough about this golf course. I love playing golf on my family trips because it helps me keep my sanity. This course delivers. Really nice.

We went for our wedding & had arrived before the regular arrival time and were supposed to be contacted when our room was ready. Check in time came along and no call so I called the front desk to check in on the status. They said they were replacing our mattress as requested, however we never requested that. I thought this was very odd. We were having our rehearsal dinner that night so we didn't have as much time to get ready as hoped due to the delay in our room being ready and receiving our baggage. The resort did press my dress within a half hour since I didn't have time to iron it at no charge, which was much appreciated! Once in our room it was very well appointed and we also loved the outdoor shower and used it daily. Our dinners and lunch at Beach Tree restaurant were fantastic! The lobster ravioli is a must and our server Jeannie was a true delight! ULU is good for breakfast and the deluxe buffet is worth the money. My sister is gluten free and they made her the best pancakes and banana bread! We had our wedding dinner at ULU, unfortunately I can't say the dinner was very good. I would not recommend the lobster pad thai. Had we known we would have booked our dinner over at Beach Tree or ordered off the sushi menu instead. The resort did make this up to us after voicing our disappointment with the dinner. Chocolate covered strawberries were delivered to my husband's parents room instead of our room on our wedding night. I brought this issue up to the front desk and they corrected it by bringing us some that night, which was very nice. I only wish I didn't have to correct the mistake. The resort location is wonderful and there is a very nice jogging pathway. The fitness equipment and workout areas are in a very nice natural setting. Make sure you get to the spa since the services and surroundings are top notch! The King's Pond is great for adults and kids, lots of fish to see in a very safe snorkeling environment.

The food was very good and we were soon enjoying the beautiful grounds and fairly peaceful surroundings.  Although hotel occupancy was very high we didn't feel it too much except for in the evenings when we tried to get a table at the Beach Tree and were told it was a 45 mins wait. So don't forget to book ahead if you want to eat between 7 and 8.30.  In terms of food we also tried the Hualalai Grille. Food was excellent. I had the Oysters and then the seared Ahi both were very tasty. We were a little bit disappointed when the waiter told us the meat was from Wyoming.  Overall the food was fantastic at all the restaurants but we thought we would see more seafood available seen as we were in Hawaii.  I love the idea of the King Pond and hope it will educate future generations .  The reason I gave it 4/5 instead of 5/5 is the overpriced menu at the 'ULU Ocean Grill. Although the food was good it did not warrant such huge prices. We gave up on coffee or herbal tea after looking at the $10 and $20 tag price.  The breakfast drink prices are also steep at $9 for an orange juice or grapefruit juice.  Also I agree with Chesl77 I noticed a lot of noise from neighbouring rooms - sliding doors and toilet flushes etc clearly audible and when I pay as much for a room I don't expect to hear those kind of noises.  The bed in room 3601 was too soft in my opinion and I often woke up still feeling a little tired.  My husband and I travel a lot and have been to two other Four Seasons. Although I do think that food prices are on the expensive side I have always been impressed by the hotels and their location.

182301730,50,An Unforgettable Honeymoon Experience.,"My wife and I spent our honeymoon at the Four Seasons at Hualalai. It was by far the most expensive but absolutely worth-every-penny type of experience for the both of us. From the moment you arrive, you are greeted by their staff members with a cold towel and fresh juice and flower leis. Check-in was a smooth process and they shuttle your bags to your room and give you a mini-tour of the entire resort property. It gives you a chance to soak in the glamour and splendor that makes Hualalai a one-of-a-kind type of resort. From the infinity pools to the ultra-fancy spa, there are a wide variety of places to choose from to spend your entire day. I know that a lot of reviews rave about how they never wanted to leave the resort to venture out but there was a day or two here and there that we did want to explore things outside of the resort. Minus the dead cockroach in the corner of our bathroom wall, the room itself was very clean and very spacious (we had an Ocean View Room #201). The view was spectacular for both sunrise and sunset. We were right by the Kings Pond where they do mostly snorkeling lessons and fish feeding. The awesome thing about this resort was the beach area where the sea turtles would just lay out in the sun! Plenty of picture opportunities! The food at the restaurants were pricey and I would have to say that I have had better food. The food was decent but we felt that certain menu items were WAY overpriced for both the portion and the taste. We actually were surprised that some menu item prices in the restaurants were the same if we were to order room service (which we actually preferred!).

I have stayed at all the resorts on the Waikoloa coast, Mauna Kea,Hapuna, Mauna Lani, The Fairmont Orchid et al. This is the best resort. However, there is definitely a downward slip in service and amenities here. They are making small but noticeable changes. These are worth mentioning because at this level, guests do notice and it does matter. First, they have decided to switch over to a ""green"" bath amenity system. Instead of the standard L'Occitane products they use as a standard amentity at many Four Seasons hotels and resorts, they are now using large refillable bottles of soaps, lotions and shampoos. While it may be effective in reducing their costs and be more sustainable, it's not a sanitary solution. It's not a better product either. It's also unattractive. Also, service standards have slipped noticeably in all departments. Either the GM is not watching these as carefully or they have changed GMs. Some of the changes they have made to the room are questionable. I do not understand why they ONLY have a rainhead shower now. Please put in a hand held shower too or wall showerhead. It must be impossible for housekeeping to clean the shower stall properly as well without this. They also have eliminated the wet bag they used to put in the rooms and the one they still provide at the spas and locker rooms is now a much cheaper version. This rating is based on expectations of the rates and compared to what else is out there globally for that rate. I still love this resort and I hope they can make some changes to bring them back on course.",Oct 2013,October 2013,Traveled on business,Be careful about upstairs or downstairs.

The property is unbelievable and the use of the property is even better. The rooms are situated in bungalows with about three rooms per building, each with it's own entrance from outside. It's such a unique resort in so many ways, such as the lack of walls in the buildings including reception, gym/spa, and restaurants. The food is outstanding, only out done by the staff.

181298759,40,This stay at the Hotel was slightly disappointing,"I have never written a review before, but after looking at the recent postings I have to agree with Brian's review from October of the same year. This was our 3rd trip to the hotel, and our expectations were high as usual. We stayed at Four Seasons all over, including Maui, Lanai, as well as mainland and so far the Hualalai resort has never failed to exceed our expectations. But this time, unfortunately I have noticed some sad changes:    Room: we requested lower level with an outside shower, and our request was honored, it was my birthday, so it was very nice to find a card and nicely presented cake, but I have noticed the bath products are no longer L'Occitane, but an unknown, nameless brand, in even more ""unluxurious"" containers.  ULU: I also had a very unpleasant experience, which was unexpected. We booked a reservation for a dinner at 8 pm, but arrived a little earlier to enjoy couple of drinks at the bar. We stopped at the hostess stend and informed her that we will be waiting for our table at the bar, 10 minutes after 8pm, we were still sitting at the bar cluless about table situation. I approched the hostess and asked her about timing, she did not apologize, rudely said that evening is buisy (which was not true, there where a few tables available), I could not beleive it was even possible at the Four Seasons. Of course, the evening was completely ruined, the manager approached our table later with apology, but it was too late. We never went back for the dinner there, and used Beachtree and Hualalai Grille, which was quite fine overall.    Overall the trip was great, and we probabaly will come back.

181091314,50,Outstanding Experience,"Just got back home after spending four outstanding nights at this fine property. Here's the rundown:    PROS:    - BEST hotel/resort staff I have EVER encountered in 38+ years, which is saying something because I travel all around the world constantly staying mostly at premium properties. Without one single exception, every staff member was genuinely happy and engaging 24/7. Amazing people work here and it made the entire experience truly WONDERFUL.    - Very well executed resort layout and thoughtful amenities.    - Gorgeous, comfortable rooms and the breathtaking natural ocean environment can't be beat.    CONS:    - Some of the outdoor areas have a funky smell at times. Not sure if this is due to the fuel used in the torches, but it could likely be improved upon with the use of some outdoor ambient fragrance solutions.    - Much of the food at the resort's restaurants was excellent (I visited four of them, two of which to which I returned repeatedly) but a handful of the dishes were mediocre if not poor for the money, particularly the sushi. There also seemed to be a consistency problem with completely different preparations of the same item on different days.    - While minibar items are available on a customized, pre-ordered basis, no snack items were pre-stocked which was sort of annoying when craving something to munch on late at night.    Overall, the pros FAR outweighed the cons and I would highly recommend this place to anyone who wishes to visit Kona and can afford to spend a few nights here.",Oct 2013,October 2013,Traveled with family,Stay away from the family pool if you want a more tranquil experience.,"Dallas, Texas"

As other reviewers have noted, and consistent with my past experiences, the service is exceptional, easily the best of any five star Hawaiian resort that I've been to. Not only are all of the staff very helpful, they're also super friendly and genuinely happy to be there. They tend to anticipate needs. At the Beach Tree pool, attendants come by later in the afternoon with frozen aloe vera gel to relieve sunburns.    The food is superlative. I did miss the large salt water aquarium from the old Pahu'ia, but the food at Ulu is very well-prepared. I preferred the simpler preparations of the Beach Tree Grill, which in my opinion, has improved in the last six years. I did not try the steakhouse, but miss Alan Wong's which used to be in that space.    The rooms are very tastefully designed, and have big lanais. I would recommend a second floor room to get a better view of the ocean, but I realize many are fans of the outdoor showers you get with first floor rooms. There are separate bath and shower stalls, and double sinks. In response to an earlier comment, the resort is using larger sized containers for bathroom products like shampoo and conditioner to be greener and more eco-friendly (which also includes not changing bed linens every day).    An issue is always how to reconcile different groups of guests. I think the Four Seasons does a good job. There was a convention of radiologists when I was there, but the resort was still quiet and the doctors well-behaved. There is a great kids' pool, the Seashell, and a good kids activity center as well. The Beach Tree and newly-expanded Palm Grove pools are quiet pools.

Upon arrival, everyone greets you with a friendly aloha and this continues for your entire stay! No matter what the staff person is doing, as soon as you walk by, they stop what they're doing to greet you with aloha. We have never experienced such friendliness! While waiting to check in, cold towels and drinks are brought. Then you are presented with leis. So beautiful! We were then taken to our room in a golf cart with our luggage. On our way to our room, the bell boy gave us a tour of the grounds and even pulled over so that we could see several Honu (green sea turtles) resting on the sand! They were within feet of the hotel! Once we arrived at our room, a champagne bottle was waiting for us to celebrate our anniversary. It was a very lovely gesture from the hotel that we appreciated very much. Our room was very clean, the bed was comfortable, and it had a great view of the ocean and resort grounds/pool area. We had a first level room which included the outdoor lava shower. The outdoor shower was very nice and I didn't feel as though anyone could see in. We ate at the Beachtree bar and grill a couple of times and enjoyed our meals. We also swam (or attempted to in my case) in the King's Pond. Be warned...IT'S SOOOO COLD! I didn't not think it would be that cold! I couldn't go in past my knees. Luckily, the staff had a shorty wetsuit that I was allowed to borrow, so I was able to go in with that. But even still, it was very cold! Every single staff member we encountered was extremely friendly and helpful; From the beach staff immediately setting up our chairs, and bringing towels and water, to the valet staff quickly bringing our car and offering us directions and water bottles, to the ULU breakfast staff remembering our names every morning!

This is the second year that our 16 person So Calif group has organized a visit, and both times the hotel messed up the billing. Our group leader told them many times to bill him for all costs, yet the hotel still charged our personal credit card over $700 by mistake.

I honestly don't know if we'd splurge on our own budget because a splurge is exactly what it is.    We felt like rock stars whether it was having our chairs draped with towels for us at the pool, shoes polished by magic elves overnight, or the always-great-service-with-a-smile attitude shown by every single person with whom we interacted.    My only frustration was that both times it took me a full 3 days to feel confident about navigation walking around the property. The good news is that you can't really get ""lost"" - but you might walk in circles.    We really experienced almost everything they have to offer. Golf was beautiful. The course is not complicated, and offers simply breathtaking views. The adult pool has a swim-up bar with fresh cocktails that are very creative. The ""quiet"" pool is where we spent most of our time, in a cabana with staff offering everything from sunglass cleaning to adult popsicles. We at at Ulu, the Beach Tree and the Hualalai Grill, and all three places were outstanding. There were special evening events catered that featured everything from fresh sashimi to grilled lobster tails to coffee-roasted sirloin steak. The spa appointments were beautiful and relaxing.

From check-in to check-out, the Four Seasons made our honeymoon feel incredibly special, especially compared to our previous hotel (which wasn't bad, but didn't feel like a special occasion). After the unique check-in process, we were upgraded from a golf view room to a pool view and enjoyed a golf cart tour of the property.    From the minute we stepped into our room, we were impressed. The shower, bedding, and decor were amazing. Our room's location was very nice - it was by the Beach Tree, and each night I could open the sliding doors and listen to the restaurant's live music and watch the sun set. The view is better on the second floor, but we had a lava rock shower on the first.    Like other reviewers, we had plans to leave but found it so relaxing and enjoyable that we didn't make it off the property. The hotel also sent complimentary champagne and a strawberry/cheese dessert to our room.    We booked six months in advance and found a great rate on the FS website. The rate was lower than other times of the year because it was late August (and hot), but that also meant less people (i.e., kids). Because it wasn't packed, there were always chairs available at the beach and the pools - where I appreciated that cabanas were first-come, first-serve.

176693965,50,Fantastic (Except For Fishing Charter),"This was our 3rd visit over the past decade and our favorite hotel in North America by a long ways. Everything looks spectacular and the staff extremely friendly and knowledgable. Rooms are great as is the food with the possible exception of Ulu which is hit and miss (stick with Beach Tree and the Hualalai Grill for better food) but I'm probably being too picky.    Unfortunately, this time, we did run into an issue with a fishing charter (Tropical Sun) which we booked through Four Seasons. Tropical Sun clearly isn't up to Four Seasons standards (and I've been on many charters). The Captain (Dennis) was extremely moody and disrespectful despite my family being courteous throughout and this was my kids' first fishing trip as well. Other 4 Seasons guest reviews I've read on Tripadvisor indicate both great and poor experiences with Tropcial Sun - but Four Seasons guests should not have to play Russian Roulette. For anyone interested in more details on our fishing trip - see link to review below:    http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60872-d2060414-r175833675-Tropical_Sun_Sportfishing-Kailua_Kona_Island_of_Hawaii_Hawaii.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT    To their credit, Four Seasons was incredibily apologetic and they were as stunned as we were about what happened. We don't hold the hotel responsible for the charter's inexplicable actions but this certainly shouldn't be a recommended charter.

I think it is the best resort anywhere in Hawaii. First the architecture of the resort is different from all other resorts - it is built in a series of two story buildings with 4 to 12 units laid out in four semi circles facing the ocean as opposed to typical large hotel buildings. This gives the resort an ambience unlike any other as instead of walking along hotel corridors you walk along pathways surrounded by tropical plants and torches for lighting. Service is consistently superb. Low density - only about 220 units. Beautiful beach, great golf course, spa and fitness facility.

176077242,40,"Mostly awesome, but...","We stayed in a 2 bedroom villa in the Hualalai resort right next to the Four Seasons. The villa was great (Cameron who owns it was very helpful), and the Four Seasons is fabulous. The only problem was that they decided a couple of months before our stay that villa guests would not have access to the pool decks during August because they get too crowded. So we had to sit either on the grass near the pools, or on the beach. It's not the end of the world, but we had expected to be able to use all the amenities of the Four Seasons, and we felt like we were second class guests when we were told we couldn't sit in certain chairs by the pool. If we'd known when we booked, we would have had nothing to complain about, but as it was we felt like they changed the terms of the contract after we had signed it. The resort always had the right to lilmit access, and they informed those who were renting villas directly through them, but unfortunately we only found out shortly before we arrived. So my advice is to not rent a villa during peak periods as you may find you can't use the pool chairs. Otherwise, if you're going any other time of the year, this is a fantastic place to go.  We had a great time, almost everyone was super-nice, the facilities are awesome, the weather is fantastic, and really we had no complaints except the lack of access to the pool deck.",Sep 2013,August 2013,Traveled with family,Don't rent a villa in peak seasons - stay in the resort itself if you can.

You don't want to leave the resort, but there are definitely some beautiful places to see not too far away from the property. The hotel organized a road rally for our group which took us to locations around Kona which was a surprisingly fun activity. The golf course and the spa were fabulous if that's your thing. The rooms, beds were all great as you would expect, and the staff would help you at the drop of a hat. I'm not sure you can find a nicer resort on this island, but it's definitely not the least expensive.  If you're not on a budget and really want a resort to get away, then I'd give the slight nod to the 4 Seasons in Bora Bora. Bungalows over the water at Bora-Bora were nicer, but there's more to do at Hualalai. 5 Stars no matter which you choose.",Sep 2013,February 2013,Traveled as a couple,,"Raleigh, North Carolina"
175980266,40,Lovely but didn't tick all our boxes :-),"While we enjoyed our stay at this resort, overall I have mixed feelings about it and for this reason probably wouldn't return, instead favoring some other establishments. The resort is beautiful and the grounds are just lovely. Staff are incredibly friendly and welcoming and we loved loved the Beach Tree restaurant! Our golf view room was lovely although was a hike away from the beach/pool/restaurants....not ideal with a toddler in tow! So I would definitely rethink this room category if this is a problem for you. The pools were lovely although our toddler really didn't like the toddler pool (and maybe this was only our child?!?) but he hated the sandy bottom because it wasn't nice and soft but was a kind of gravel instead which was uncomfortable as it embedded itself into your skin and between your toes. Also not pleasant walking on this wet 'sand' out of the pool and unfortunately this sand found itself everywhere, even in the bigger pools. The adult pool however was apparently devine....or so my husband reports as I didn't get a chance to experience it! The beach was also not greatest, not terrible just rocky in most places and on a sharp incline, except for the beautiful turtles in the water! Of course I liked the no charge for cabanas but on the other end of scale found some things were pricey - had in room breakfast dining one morning and along with 2 meals ordered 2 hard boiled eggs by themselves and 1 banana for our toddler - was charged $12 for the eggs and $3 for 1 banana....really?

From the moment you arrive--when they know your names as you step out of the car--they treat you right. Cold bottled water in the car's cup holder's every time valets bring it up for you. Quick check in with cold towels, beverages, leis. Excellent service on the beach, at all the pools, in all the restaurants. Yes, there are quite a lot of families--and children--at the resort, but kids seem to stay at the main, family pool, leaving the quieter--and in my opinion, nicer--other 2 pools for the grown-ups. Kids were not really an issue on the beach either. My one knock on the hotel would be that the swimming/snorkeling/water sports off the beach are rather limited; however, great snorkeling beaches are short drives away. The rooms themselves are excellent. We splurged on an oceanfront room, and were absolutely thrilled to be upgraded to an oceanfront suite, which was huge. However, I'm sure we would have been happy in any of the rooms on the resort. I love how it didn't at all feel like a large Hawaiian resort but rather like a small, luxury boutique hotel.

Beautiful property and no reason to leave the resort. Unfortunately, we had a few things that I think are unacceptable for the Four Seasons Resort. The bed in room 3404 was the worst bed we have ever tried to sleep in. We definitely should have complained about it and given the resort a chance to fix it, but we didn't. Our room was in a building that was next to the parking lot and probably the least desirable and it made us think that they just hadn't gotten around to replacing the beds in that building. Not so good when your paying $800.00 a night.  One night we had dinner at the beach grill and my boyfriend ordered the ribeye steak. It was pretty pathetic. We both were shocked. It was probably a 1/8 inch thick....if that!! Again, worst steak we have ever had!

As expected, at this location guests are pretty well captive on property, with restaurant options extremely expensive. Ulu was fabulous for drinks at dusk, but the food we thought underwhelming for the prices. Their breakfast buffet was very good, but not exceptional, for the price. We liked the Beach Tree for lunch. The beach areas for swimming are limited, but the pools were fantastic. There are plenty of things to do on the Big Island with families. We went fishing with Tropical Sun (captain was great, fish were missing that morning), touring by helicopter with Blue Hawaiian, and went dolphin swimming and snorkeling with Kona Ocean Adventures. The Kona Ocean Adventures trip was likely the highlight for us, but the helicopter tour is an unforgettable can't miss experience. All in all, the resort grew on us, the setting and island seem perfect for a low-key, relaxing getaway.

I asked a gardener how many landscape people the hotel employed, he guessed at 300/400. It shows - just stunning everywhere you go. We were made to feel very welcome and nothing was too much trouble. We'd stayed at the Hapuna Beach Prince Hotel for ten nights, for the beach and for a cheaper base to explore the island. The difference between the two was unsurprisingly immediate to spot and lasted throughout. You can see where the extra money goes - this is by far the most lavish hotel we've stayed at, but hey...it was our honeymoon.    We're pretty well-travelled and used to lugging our own bags so it was kinda nice to have a guy literally run towards us and take our bags off us when he saw us coming from the self park. As you may expect you're charged for nothing here - no parking, wifi, snorkel hire charges etc. We never felt out of place either (we're used to, and happy with, much more modest tastes) - there was no snobbery.    Our room wasn't quite ready but we were taken care of at the Beach Tree - we ate and drank for an hour or so before being shown our room. As we'd taken just twenty or so minutes to get there and were well rested, this was a positive rather than an inconvenience. The room was tremendous. You always hear 'you get what you pay for' and you certainly do here.    The food on offer was surprisingly competitively priced - paid $17 for a steak burger (delicious; not usually in the business of paying so much for a burger, but you're on holiday...) at our previous hotel and the food here was in line with that really, perhaps a bit more. Same goes for dinner.    Everything we ate or drank was of the highest quality. We did the barbecue on Wednesday evening - $125 all you can eat/drink. I'm not the sort to pig out like this usually but if you add up all we had it worked out well. It did look a little dead when we walked past for the earlier seating but luckily we met a nice couple and got chatting...it's billed as a family barbecue. Don't know as I would do this again but as a one off, delicious.    Every single member of staff greets you with a smile/aloha - rare service indeed. A dude remembered our name from the day before and we'd only spoken briefly, setting up a beach bed. Staff come and offer cold towels, bring you ice water without you asking. They'll go off and go to extra effort to get a cocktail recipe from another bar...you get the picture.    It's billed as a resort and they do have a lot going on. There's a few different pools, hot tub areas, a small shop, a beautiful looking location for luau, basketball, gym and more...again, all pristine.    The beach isn't fantastic but there were sea turtles on it. Was very nice to swim with them when they went in for a dip. Quite a rocky beach though with sharper sand so not a place for beach sports. For novice snorkelers and kids they have their own pond with an eagle ray and lots of fish - this was nice.    In a word, outstanding.

173767146,40,Beware if you are renting a villa,"This is our second trip to the Four Seasons at Hualalai. We were blown away during our first trip and couldn't wait to return. I will start with the positives. This place is extremely family friendly. There are tons of activities for children ages 5+ (snorkeling, movie nights, overnight ""camping"", snorkeling, etc). Our kids had a fantastic time! Since we have never actually stayed in the hotel, I cannot comment on the accommodations but the restaurant and pool side services are very good, if a bit pricey.    The negatives:  1) The rules have been recently changed for villa guests. If you are staying in a villa, you will be last on the list when it comes to seating by the pool. I wish this had been pointed out in advance! Indeed, villa guests can only sit in the grassy area or on the beach which can be a little frustrating, especially when there are lots of open seats poolside. I understand that demand for pool seating outstrips supply but this is somewhat unexpected on a luxury vacation when you are paying $1200-$2500+/night PLUS a $50 per person resort fee. Getting up at 7:00am to reserve one of the few spots available to villa guests is not conducive to having a relaxing vacation.    2) I was impressed during my first visit by all the little things, e.g. the fruit service, free pool diapers by the toddler pool and post cards. It seems like they have done away with the pool diapers as I have been here for 7 days now and have not seen any for the taking. Luckily, I brought my own.    3) Make sure you secure your dining reservations early. Once again demand may outstrip supply, especially for prime dining times.    4) The family pool/hot tub were crowded and noisy at times. This didn't really bother me, but I can see how it could bother some people.    That said, we thought this was going to be our annual go-to vacation spot and now we aren't so sure. Still a nice place but we may want to explore more places before we settle down.",Aug 2013,August 2013,Traveled with family,,"San Francisco, California"
173649431,50,Most PERFECT vacation experience.,"This hotel was incredible. Turtles on the beach, amazing food, impecable customer service (as always for Four Seasons), LAVE ROCK SHOWER (request it!), great spa (outdoor massages are AWESOME!), nothing but great things to say. The selection of pools for family/quiet/bar was great, and there really is no bad spot by the pools or on the beach. The check in was probably the best ""Welcome to your vacation"" experience I have had. After a very long journey from the east coast and a late night arrival, they greeted us at the airport (unexpectedly, especially since we took an earlier flight than scheduled), gave us easy directions to the hotel. When we arrived at the hotel (the lobby totally quiet and closed down for the night), they greeted us with fragrant gorgeous leis, a bite of fresh pineapple, and a delicious non-alcoholic mai tai served in a coconut shell. A receptionist sat down with us to check us in and get us settled. There was no line, no desk, completely personalized attention, and no hassle at all.

We stayed in one of the golf view suites which was nice, but mixed in with standard rooms and condo's nearby, so quite noisy. The rooms at the main hotel struck us as a bit conjested also. Standard of housekeeping was very very good.    The food was generally good, but not amazing. We felt the service and quality in Ulu was lacking to the point we avoided it, and they really should of had the steakhouse open for lunch as its over the golf club. However we thoroughly enjoyed the laid back awesomeness of the residents beach house - the food, wine and service here is so much more personal.    The beach is great, and plenty of spots to swim, and if your into golf the course is absolutely faultless - the highlight and chief reason to stay here for us.    This was our first time at a Four Seasons... and probably we wouldn't stay again given a choice, however if staying in this part of Hawaii it looked to be far superior to anything else, and then theres that golf course....",Aug 2013,April 2013,Traveled as a couple,,sydney
173432056,50,Paradise found.,"As residents of Hawai'i, we are surrounded by the beauty of the islands every day, though when we stay at Hualalai, it feels as though we have traveled worlds away. This resort has it all, impeccable staff, rooms and amenities that make you never want to leave the property. From the palm grove infinity pool with swim-up bar to the King's Pond where you can snorkel with tropical fish, the resort offers everything you can imagine to take advantage of the location, from stand-up paddling to outrigger canoeing to championship golf and a world-class spa. The restaurants are no different. Beach Tree serves up great cocktails and spectacular Cal-Italian cuisine in an open-air setting that is hard to beat, and a great place to catch sunset. The staff here is very attentive and fun, and the ambiance has a laid-back vibe that isn't always present at a Four Seasons property. There are so many great things on the menu, that I wouldn't know where to start, other than make sure to plan on daily lunch a a couple dinners here at a minimum. There is also live nightly entertainment that adds to the vibe here. The other dining option is also first-rate, 'ULU, which leans towards a more seafood-inspired menu that also focuses on local ingredients, with an impressive wine list and provides more great ambiance as well, and another great spot for a sunset meal. They also have a great sushi lounge around the bar area. It is really hard to summarize the experience at Hualalai, as it really is paradise, and it is very hard to leave each time we go.

173356200,50,positively surprised,"My opinion about FS has been a mixed bag. They have wonderful properties like NY, Milan, Beverly Hills. Then they have some older like Austin , Mexico City , Boston and some like Houston you ask yourself : is this a four seasons ? So we arrived in Hualalai a bit skeptical. The FS a couple of years ago in Maui failed to impress so what could we expect here ?  Well, to tell you the truth it's almost perfect. The service is astonishing for such a large property. The food is great and even at decent prices (so the wines). The beach is very nice, so the pools and the Kings Pond that lets the kids snorkel like in an aquarium is just.. great.  You have a nice selection of restaurants with a large variety of foods (from sushi to steak house) and quality is very good and prices are reasonable for such a luxury hotel.  The concept is very nice. You are in a luxury resort but you have different laundry facilities near the rooms so you can quickly wash your clothes if you want without spending a fortune (important if you want to stay in a resort for a week without paying a fortune for washing) . You can get ice and water anytime there too for free . If you want to spend a fortune in a very good wine you can but if you want to bring your special bottle of wine you can too (they just charge cork money ). They have a store where you even can buy the wine and then bring it . Otherwise you go to Alex Thropp at Kopiko Plaza in Kailua-Kona and he has the most amazing selection of wines for a special evening.  They have different events , like the polynesian dance , that are beautiful even if quite pricey ( yep , buffet could offer a bit more for that .. especially for the kids when they pay 80 usd..).    But it's a truly great place, with a speedy wonderful service that is hard to beat. It's a place you can stay with the family for a week because they were so smart to allow you to spend a lot of money if you want, but give you alternatives if you don't want to.

173265691,50,Best Hawaii Resort I've been to,"We went to the Four Seasons Hualalai in April to celebrate our wedding anniversary. The resort is as good as everything you have read on TripAdvisor. One of the best resorts I've been to and easily the best resort I've been to on any of the Hawaiian islands (although I have not been to Four Seasons Maui - maybe next year).    As others have written the resort is beautiful, quiet and relaxing. We really enjoyed going for morning jogs along the path that goes alongside the golf course. The combination of the colors from the green golf course, up against the black lava rock and the blue ocean was just spectacular. But go run early (7am or earlier) as it gets hot quickly especially those of us used to running in cool San Francisco temperatures.    Food:  Breakfast each morning was very good. Loved the food and loved the initial service. For some reason, we struggled on two occasions to even find our waitress to get the bill and each time had to go to the hostess and ask for her help. I like breakfast but when I'm done I want to get to the pool!    Lunch is ok at best - biggest problem is that even for a Four Seasons it's just way overpriced and borderline ridiculous. $24 for a chop salad? They are simply betting that you won't waste time going off property for lunch.    Drinks are good but at $16 per drink my wife and I have already decided that if we visit again we will simply stop by a local store and buy a bottle or two of Kettle One and keep it in our room and make our own drinks since our preferred drink is Kettle on the rocks. However, the bartenders at the Beach Tree bar were superb. They were very personable and helped the guests meet each other. So at least we had a good time while we paid NYC Meatpacking district prices for our drinks (yes, I'm an ex-New Yorker)    Dinner at Beach Tree might be one of the best dinner/life experiences I've ever had. The combination of the 2 piece band (different one each night), the kids playing on the lawn during the setting sun and the view of the beach/sunset/ocean is a unique experience. I also want to applaud all the parents who were there with their children. The children were having a good time on the lawn in front of the restaurant but they were never loud and they were never out of control. Well done mom/dad!    Dinner at Ulu was also very good, but once we had dinner at Beach Tree we decided that was the place for us and cancelled our reservations at Hualalai Grill and La Bourgogne (off property but a place I read good things about) and replaced them with Beach Tree.    We also went off property on two occasions. One night we ate at Kenichi Pacific (sushi). It was decent but not worth the long drive. Plus the place is in a strip mall so it doesn't have any island feel to it. Could very well have been in a strip mall in New York or California. I wouldn't go back. The other time we just ate in a random place downtown after the evening Manta Ray dive.    Scuba Diving:  After reading the reviews we went with Kona Dive Company and they were amazing. My wife was very nervous as she had not been diving in a few years. During her first dive the instructor paid special attention to her in the water and helped her during her decent as she was having trouble with her ears. Plus they set up all the equipment, you just have to put it on! Awesome! I highly recommend the Manta Ray night dive - what a unique experience. It's kind of like a theater with all the diver lights acting as lights on a stage and then the main attraction, Manta Rays, show up and put on a show. I would go again in a heartbeat!    This was a much needed vacation for me and my wife and I wanted to make sure I picked a place that was superb. I'm proud to say that the Four Seasons Hualalai was just that.

There is a beautiful walking/running map along the shore nestled between lava rocks and ocean. Great way to start your sunrise! Snorkel trip from hotel allowed me to snorkel with Spinner dolphins, reef shark, coral reefs. All that in 1.5 hours and a reasonable rate too! Restaurants are good.    Con's- The resort should not charge a flat fee for renting paddle boards. I am amazed how lessons are needed for hotel guests! The bay is calm enough. The hotel seems to nickel and dime guests with this. Why not just charge a flat resort fee for non-motorized water sports?    You can eat outside resort, if you have a car.

Like many others we had plans to go out but simply loved the property so much that we ate every meal there instead. Unlike Four Seasons Maui it is not just a two minute drive to get somewhere, so you have to have purpose. A 1/2 hour drive back to the hotel on a dangerous road after dinner just seemed impractical, especially with such good choices.  The beds were super comfortable. The view unbelievable. The rooms simple, functional, tasteful, and über clean.  The staff everywhere was polite and super helpful. The workout area and spa were great. I had a body treatment ( I don't usually do that especially being a dude) but it was GREAT. I plan on trying to do that on an infrequent basis at home!  I had concerns about not enough good snorkeling, but the area in front of the adult pool had a nice little cove that was plenty enough for me. Turtles, coral, all sorts of fish. As I dove on the trip it wasn't my only source of that kind of thing. If you absolutely have to have a huge ocean/beach where you can swim for miles and snorkel then Maui is better, but between the two (and we have stayed at Maui many times) we have decided to come back here as much or more.

It was the perfect place to celebrate our 10 year anniversary, and we felt very special throughout our stay.    B- Beach Tree dinners were fantastic! We enjoyed three during our trip. The Tuscan bread was amazing! The view at sunset was spectacular too. Live Hawaiian music and a hula dancer at sunset with the most incredible food…could it get any better?    C- Cookies and milk with turndown service each night was such a treat! I am so glad I mentioned that my husband loves cookies and milk.    D- Dinners were spectacular! Ulu, Beach Tree, Hualalai Grill, and the Resident’s Beach House were phenomenal restaurants. Each night I thought the food could not get any better and it did! Tip- you can order room service dinner from any menu on site! One night we ordered room service dinner from Beach Tree. The Pineapple Mahi at Ulu was superb, arugula and fried goat cheese salad at Beach Tree divine, the lobster and seafood pasta at Hualalai Grill heavenly, purple Molokai sweet potato salad at the luau phenomenal, and the strawberry rhubarb cobbler from Resident’s Beach House was out of this world! Definitely a place for foodies! You may even see a celebrity stroll by as you are eating. We did!    E- Evian spritzes at the adult pool were refreshing on a hot Hawaiian day.    F- Food was fabulous! We did not even leave the hotel for a meal. I cannot say enough about the spectacular food! See my other reviews for each specific restaurant for more food details. Definitely a place for foodies!    G- Georgia was a doll, and I loved her smiley and professional service at the Palm Grove Pool!  H- Hammocks and Honu! Hammocks around the adult pool were the perfect place to relax, day or night. The Honu (sea turtles) were all over the beach, and we loved seeing them each day.    I- Ice cream sandwich trio at the Beach Tree pool? Awesome! You must order these after lunch at the pool! Other favorites? The Ahi burger was out of this world, and so was the tomato, avocado, mozzarella salad. Best pool lunch food EVER!    J- Juice was offered each morning for breakfast at Ulu. Each day they came around with a pitcher of the day’s fresh and tropical creation. Yum!    K- Kids were not a problem at this resort. There were children, but they were not swarming the grounds as other reviews suggested. It is a wonderful place for a romantic getaway. Compared to other resorts we have stayed at in Hawaii, this one had fewer children.    L- Lava rock showers and lizards! The lava rock outdoor showers were awesome! We loved having a room on the bottom level so we could enjoy the outdoor shower each day. They are huge! My husband also loved seeing lizards all over the resort, including in the outdoor shower. We never saw a lizard in our room though.    M- Movie Under the Stars was a great way to spend Friday night! When we wanted to order pizza at the snack bar and they did not offer it, they placed a room service order for us, and had our pizza delivered right to the grass!    N- Nicest people ever! All of the people who work at the Four Seasons Hualalai are genuinely kind, friendly, and caring. Adam Bardetta, room manager, was helpful and handled everything so well. Georgia at the pool was such a hard worker and a total doll. Everyone we met at check-in made us feel so welcomed and appreciated. It is a happy place!    O- One call is all it took to ask about getting a desk in our room so my husband could set up a work station. When we got back from dinner, we had a large desk and chair in our room! Awesome service!    P- Photos do not do the resort justice! It is 1,000 times more beautiful in real life. But, thankfully, we hired amazing EyeExpression Photographer, Bob Brown, to capture the moment at sunset one evening during our trip, as a way to remember our 10 year anniversary. See an attached photo Bob took of us at the hotel after sunset. I highly recommend doing a one hour photo shoot with Bob! We now have hundreds of lovely pictures to remember our trip forever. www.eyeexpressionphotography.com I found him online, but then I later found out that he is a Four Seasons preferred vendor, so he knew the property very well and was able to capture fantastic shots. His prices are very reasonable too!    Q- Quiet, calm, and peaceful vibe…such a serene resort. Even at a 95% occupancy level, it never felt crowded.    R- Relaxed…for nine days straight at the most beautiful resort in the Hawaiian Islands.    S- Sunsets were surreal and we got to enjoy them every night during dinner.    T- Treats at the pool like fresh fruit, Dibs, Otter Pops, sangria samples, and margarita samples were great! I also loved having sunscreen, water, leave-in conditioner, magazines and postcards at each pool stand.    U- Ukulele lessons were so much fun! I had the two most patient and friendly teachers. The free lessons are offered on Mondays and Fridays at the resort.    V- Virgin blueberry lavender mojitos at the Palm Grove Pool were fantastic!    W- Water was plentiful! I loved having bottled water at turndown service, fruit flavored water at all of the pools, and purified water and ice in each laundry room.    X- Xoxo I love Four Seasons Hualalai!    Y- Yes, it is totally worth it! I spent months researching the perfect place to celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary. We had it narrowed down to a European cruise, Fiji, or the Four Seasons Hualalai. After reading hundreds of reviews and talking to others who had been, we decided on the Four Seasons Hualalai. I am so happy we did! Eight nights at the Four Seasons Hualalai was the same price as Europe or Fiji, but it was worth the price. My husband and I love the Hawaiian islands, and we have been to Maui, Oahu, Kauai, Lanai, and the Big Island of Hawaii more than 13 times over the past 10 years, so our expectations were quite high, as we have stayed in some very lovely hotels. This resort took all of the best parts of our favorite Hawaiian hotels and put them all together in the Four Seasons Hualalai. We loved it! Everything was easy. If you are looking for a pristine, relaxing, and enjoyable vacation, this is it. Of the Hawaiian Islands, the Big Island as a whole is still our least favorite, but the Four Seasons Hualalai is now our favorite hotel. For exploring, lush beauty, great food, and adventure, we prefer the other islands, but for ultimate relaxation in one magical place that you never want to leave, Hualalai is it! The Big Island does offer adventure and many places and things to see, but it is so large that getting around the island can be exhausting. Go to the Four Seasons Hualalai and stay put! We only left for part of one day to see Hapuna Beach and Akaka Falls near Hilo, which was enjoyable. Coming back to the hotel was even better!    Z- Zen Gardens (mini ones) were between all of the chaise lounges at the Palm Grove Pool. Have they thought of everything? What’s not to love?    That pretty much sums up our magical eight nights at the Four Seasons Hualalai. I hope you have a wonderful trip!",Aug 2013,August 2013,Traveled as a couple,,California
172414796,30,Fine resort but snubbed by concierge,"We stayed here in august for three nights before meeting a larger family group in maui for a week.  There are many beautiful aspects of this hotel, the grounds were pretty, the ocean was beautiful and the food was quite delicious, especially the brunch at Ulu. Note: the only ocean swimming is a man made cove which bears a sign warning swimmers of sea urchins and man o wars, to name a few hazards. Here in maui we have access to many beaches with seemingly regular risk to swimmers. Also stayed in a first floor room at kings pond which was a tiny bit run down, wicker fraying on chair and slight musty smell, bit of mold on ceiling by vent. Otherwise, decor was nice.    However, one main reason to come to the big island is to experience the active volcano, Kilauea, via a helicopter tour, which we scheduled weeks ahead of our visit. As it turns out, the tours the few days before our visit were cancelled due to weather and the day before ours, we recieved literally four voicemails from the concierge urging us to proactively cancel our tour for the next day, because weather was ""probably"" going to be an issue. I bought this line from them unfortunately, and at the concierge desk the next day, I heard that the helicopter tours were going out as scheduled and I asked them why they did not contact us to reschedule ours? Obviously, they had given our seats to other guests that had had their tours cancelled on previous days. There is no way that they would not have let us know about the availability of seats if ours were still free, the seats were over $500 pp, and we had decided to cancel the night before at 6 or 7 pm, after regular business hours.  So, my conclusion was that they had some angry guests regarding the previous cancellations and prioritized their needs over ours.    I asked the concierge for an explanation of the proactive cancellation and why not a proactive rescheduling and never got an answer. They tried to offer us another tour with a different company but it did not work out as we were leaving the next day. They seemed genuinely sorry that we were upset about this but not sorry they prioritized other guest's needs over ours.    In conclusion, we will not return to this four seasons.

171772613,50,One Fantastic Stay,We sometimes spend more than we should on a night's stay. There cannot be a better place to spend (our) top dollar than the Four Seasons Hualalai. Everything about our stay was exceptional. It started when we were personally greeted by name when we opened the doors of our vehicle at the hotel itself (you have to provide your name to a gate keeper in order to gain entrance to the grounds so we surmised the gate keeper notified the valet and front desk of our imminent arrival) to the personal farewell upon the conclusion of our stay. The grounds were a showplace and quiet despite the hotel being fairly full we were told. The ocean view was spectacular. Seeing sea turtles resting undisturbed on the beach was a special treat.

171562619,30,Disappointing Visit,"After reading all the glowing reviews and the list of awards the resort has received, I truly wanted to love this place, but my 10 night stay was marred by numerous service hiccups. Positives first: this resort is a spectacular property that is lush, inviting, and restorative. Though there must have been hundreds of guests there, the layout of the resort ensured that it never felt crowded and felt quite secluded. Spa services and amenities were wonderful and I particularly enjoyed my deep tissue massage. That being said, I experienced too many service problems that prevented me from having an amazing stay.    Starting from the first day, I called to request my property tour - I was told that Raphael (front desk manager) was going to meet me, but he never showed up. I spent 90 minutes making periodic phone calls trying to figure out what was going on - finally, they just ended up sending someone else to meet me. The pools offered variety, but service was inconsistent. I have no doubt the attendants were working very hard, so it seemed to be more an issue with being short-staffed, particularly in more secluded areas like the Palm Grove, where I would request water, other beverages, a menu, etc. that either never materialized or required me to repeat my request. Beach Tree pool (the quiet pool) was stunning with great amenities, such as Evian spritzes, cold towels, beverage samples. But it was most definitely was not quiet, as it was often filled with noisy kids - I only witnessed one attendant who tried to enforce the ""quiet pool"" policy. At the spa, I was booked for the wrong type of manicure even after clarifying on the phone earlier that the service booked was indeed the one I requested. I also booked a private yoga lesson, but on the day of the session, found out that the instructor had never received confirmation of my appointment and, thus, was not there. Luckily, they were able to find someone else on site and also comped the session.    I would have brushed these incidents off if there had only been a couple problems, but this was not the type of service I was expecting at a resort of this caliber. I came in with really high hopes, but unfortunately left disappointed.",Aug 2013,July 2013,Traveled solo,,"Toronto, Canada"

However, relative to my experience about a year ago, I've noticed some minor flaws. (1) check in wasn't as smooth as it once was. The area felt overcrowded and we had to wait a considerable amount of time to get checked in. (2) the place appears to be much more crowded despite the fact I came at exact same time last year. It appears they're operating beyond capacity. They've run out of lounge chairs so they've brought in cheap pool chairs that look out of place and aren't consistent with the overall quality of the property. Management - get these things off the property!!! (3) the staff, while still fantastic, is not on point like they once were. I had to walk between two cleaning ladies having an argument. The security at the gate was rude. Staff racing by in golf carts without a nod.

170304290,40,First-class Paradise,"I had the pleasure of spending a week at this property in July 2013 with my husband and a group of his colleagues. The service was fantastic. We often say that you can identify great service by the extra touches. The gentleman on the beach who cleaned our sunglasses every day. The young lady who sprayed our faces with Evian mist. The bar tender at ULU who helped us select the most amazing after-dinner drinks. The charming waitress who served a rowdy group of us a late-night dinner at the Beach Tree. The friendly staff members throughout the property who greeted us with an ""Aloha"" and a smile each day. The way everyone who worked there seemed to really be enjoying their jobs. These are a few of the highlights that come to mind when I think of the service we experienced at the Four Seasons Hualalai.    Our ocean-view room was located in the group of cottages behind the Beach Tree restaurant. It was always very clean and the cleaning service actually dressed the group's mascot -- a stuffed lion -- in one of the resort's signature robes one day. We had room service one morning which was excellent, and we also tried ULU's breakfast buffet as well as quick bites at the Hualalai Trading Co. We were never disappointed. Lunch was usually by the pool or on the beach and always delivered by a friendly server. We had dinner at ULU Sushi Bar & Lounge one night which was fantastic -- probably our best meal on the property. The souffle is not to be missed!    If I have to critique the property, there are two things I can point out.    First is its location on the island. I'll start by saying that the Big Island has 11 out of 13 climates depending on where you are. Hualalai is located in the southwestern section of the island, which is mostly desert. The only scenery is what has been created by the resorts (which is beautiful of course) and the volcanic rock that is practically everywhere. If you are going to stay here you have to drive some distance to get to more scenic areas such as Volcanoes National Park or waterfalls. We rented a car and drove the circumference of the island in about 12 hours, although it would've been better if we took 2 days to do this (spending the night in another hotel along the way) so that we wouldn't have had to miss out on any of the destinations along the way.    My second critique would be that it is VERY quiet. If you are someone who likes to stay out past 11, this resort may be a slight disappointment. Everything closes down at 11 so if you are with a group you will have to go back to someone's room to get together for a drink. And you will not want to be too loud on your terrace because everyone else will be sleeping. :)    That being said, I would absolutely recommend this resort. With the fantastic service, gorgeous beach, 5 amazing pools and delectable food, you will have an amazing experience.",Aug 2013,July 2013,Traveled on business,,"Commack, New York"

I had read all of the reviews on tripadvisor and was hoping it was going to be as good as everybody said and it really was. It was even better than I could have hoped.    We stayed at the hotel for the final night of our trip to Hawaii as a treat. We were made to feel extremely special.

The gym is really good and big!    We ate at Ulu. The chef made me something special as I'm vegetarian and didn't see anything I liked on the menu. We had lunch at the beach grill which was also very good.    We saw a few turtles which was amazing.    I just wish we'd stayed there longer!    I stayed at the four seasons in Maui which was great but I think this place is in a different league.    The only small problem we came across at both Maui and this four seasons was the lack of seating around the adult pools unless you get up really early (8am or earlier) they did offer to put you on a waiting list I'm not too sure what else they could do about this.There was plenty seating on the beach and some of the other pools at this one which was fine so we just sat there.    Apart from a beautiful hotel with beautiful grounds the thing that made our stay special was the service!! Top notch. We felt very special and looked after!

168735970,50,"Our ""New"" Best Restort","We stayed here July 13th - 20th in room 712 overlooking Kings Pond.    We arrived at the resort around 3pm on Saturday. We rented a car, so I dropped the wife off at the lobby to check in while I went to park the car after the bags were unloaded. Walking back, I was greated by name and served my first drink of the trip. We were quickly taken to our room. Check in time is 3pm, so the room was ready. If you arrive before then, your room may not be ready, so walk around and get to know the resort.    Our room was nice with a large bathroom, walkin closet, king bed and nice seating area (table and two chairs), and a large balcony overlooking kings pond and the ocean. Great sun in the morning to sit and wake up and good shade in the evening. It was a perfect location as it was rather quiet in the early AM and later PM as kings pond opens at 10am and closes around 4pm. Just down the steps, there was an area for a washer and dryer with all the supplies if you needed to use them. This part of the resort is also eco friendly, so you don't have bottled water in the rooms. Housekeeping was great with keeping our pitcher filled with fresh water and ice.    The beach is not the best of beachs, but it serves a purpose. There are pleanty of beach chairs available at all times of the day. Early in the AM there are several turtles that hang around, which are nice to see. We didn't see many people in the water as it is pretty rocky. There are a couple areas that looked good for swimming if you wanted to get in the water.    Pools were great!. There is a kids pool, a quiet pool and an adult pool. Since we were without kids, we kept to the latter two pools. Since we were with a group of people, about 50, we all like to get together and talk while we had a few drinks. We were told to be quite a few times in the quite pool even though we were not being loud. Apparently we were annoying a lady who just wanted to read her book and not hear anyone talking. The adult pool is nice, has a swim up bar, but hardly has any people in it. There are no parties going on at any of the pools and they are all relatively quite, even the ""family"" pool. So if you think you are going to live it up with thumping music at a pool, this is not the place you want to go.    The food on the resort was great! Just be prepared for resort prices. Mixed drinks were all almost $18 and up. Beer was $8 and up. For a couple, plan on $80 breakfast, $100 lunch, and $150 dinner each day with a drink or two. We ate at Beach Tree, Ulu and Hualalai grill during our visit. I thought all three were great, but my wife thought the dinner at Hualalai grill was the best. At all three places, you can get anyting from fish tacos to sushi to steak.    There are kids at the resort. Most can be found around the family pool. Good pool kid section there with kid sized chairs and hot tub including a sandy pool area for them. Kids are also plentiful at kings pond. At sunset, they also tend to gather around Beach Tree in the grass area. Parents are getting a drink and letting the kids go. All in all, it is not like the place is overrun with kids.    Kings Pond was nice. It is very cold, but you can get your snorkel fix and see a few fish. The water is not crystal clear and it kind of creeped my wife out, but it is what it is. If you have kids, it is a good place for them to see a lot of fish and swim around.    Another thing to note, there is not a lot of nightlife. By 10pm, the resort is pretty much shut down. So, there really isn't anyplace to sit and drink to 1am if that is what you are looking for.    My wife said the spa was great. I know she spent a lot of time over there, so it must have been. We also played tennis. It was rather expensive, but it was an activity we did and we met a few great people there.    I did golf one day. All in, green fee, cart, shoes and clubs with two sleeves of balls was $350. But you can golf as much as you want. One round was plenty for me as I am not a huge golfer.

I felt the resort had quite a corporate, formulaic feel to it, service felt fake/cheesy etc, and it lacked the charm and special touch I've experienced at other tropical resorts.    I arrived at lunch-time and despite the resort having had my arrival details for around a fortnight there was no room ready and I had to wait around three hours. I took lunch in the overcrowded Beach Tree Grill, was lucky to get the last table but then had to wait over an hour for a poor pizza with an undercooked base and flavourless toppings. Lucky I wasn't in a hurry, but the table behind me was and left without eating.    Dining in general was disappointing for a resort of this standard - there are three restaurants and they are all Grills of some description. The aforementioned Beach Tree has an Italian bias but the pasta and pizza were pretty average. Beach Tree is the only one open at lunchtime so it gets rammed and you often can't get a table. Don't understand why this is the only lunchtime dining option in a hotel of this size. The grill at the golf club was a steakhouse but again pretty average by American standards - I got served a mediocre steak with undercooked sides. The Ulu Grill is probably the best of the dining options with a good local sourcing ethos but the menu has thai/chinese/japanese/hawaiian/western influences and none of the dishes seemed to master any particular cuisine (plus the wind got up one night and they had to move everyone inside which led to a bit of a disintegration in service).    One great thing the Four Seasons has in its favour is its location for exploring the island. The airport is only 5-10 minutes away (but you don't hear the planes). The highlights of my trip were things I did outside of the resort and all were pretty easy to reach - Diving with Jack's Diving Locker (25 mins drive), golf at Mauna Kea (30 mins), helicopter tour with Hawaiian Blue (15 mins) and driving Saddle Rd at sunset.    The service at the golf club was good and the course and grounds of the hotel in general were exceptionally well kept. The hotel's golf course is overpriced in my view at $250 when Mauna Kea is a far better course and can be had for $150 after 11am. It was a similar story at the Spa where I just felt they were cutting corners - no choice of inside or outdoors treatment room, no foot bowl at start of treatment, no scent under the face rest, no choice of oils, loud TV in the relax area etc.    Nobody seems to swim in the sea and there are signs warning strongly against it owing to all the rocky lava and strong currents. The beach is very narrow and the on-site watersports crew have pretty much given up offering the diving options that I was expecting from the website, as they say it was pretty much impossible to get in and out of the water with the equipment. The pools are therefore really crowded. I used King's Pond a couple of times (snorkelling pool with tropical fish) which is a nice concept but it was pretty cold and had poor visibility (seemed like a lot of ""fish matter"" floating around). The adults pool had kids in every time I walked past so I more often used the lap pool at the spa. This is empty most the time as there isn't any staff/service there but this meant that a couple of times sweaty teens would come off the basketball or tennis courts and just jump in without showering or changing which is pretty disgusting.    The rooms on the Ocean have a lovely view and get the sunset in the evening. They are tastefully decorated and the beds are very comfortable. I noticed a lot of noise from neighbouring rooms - sliding doors and toilet flushes etc clearly audible but maybe I just got a bad neighbour. Again compared to other resorts I've stayed in, I would have expected some fresh fruit / large water bottles etc each day but this is another little touch that doesn't happen here.    This was my first time in Hawaii so I've no local benchmark, but for $800-900++ per night it just doesn't stack-up against the international competition for me. It felt like there were some corners cut and that they charge what they do because they can.",Jul 2013,July 2013,Traveled solo,"Rooms by King's Pond seemed a little quieter with good views of the ocean, and are near the...","London, United Kingdom"

Service was excellent. The resort was beautiful and breathtaking. There is so much to do and if you don't want to do anything but just relax, and read, it is still the perfect place. Hulu, at the concierge, arranged for us ""The Umauma Falls and Zip Line"" and ""The spectacular Helicopter Ride"". It was unbelievable. The food was excellent too. Expensive but worth it!!!

She assisted us arranging our wedding there from when we got engaged (February 2012) until we left the island on July 8th. We also would like to acknowledge, Tabitha (Brittany's assistant) for making sure the wedding party was on time and in the right place during the wedding. Heidi, the hotel's florist, did a wonderful job with all the floral arrangements for our wedding ceremony and reception. Thank you, Timothy (the night manager) who checked us in and also sent us strawberries with a chocolate dipping sauce for a wedding gift. We also would like to thank Rachel, the pastry chef, for sending us a chocolate assortment for our wedding. The hotel staff really do go out of their way for the hotel guests.

When we commented about the iced tea and how wonderful it was, we had two free bags of tea in our room the next day with a handwritten note from the waiter.

166680928,50,Other Options to Use/Stay at The Four Seasons Hualalai,"This was the 2nd stop on our 3 week family vacation to the Hawaiian Islands. The first was 8 nights in Maui at the Wailea Beach Villas. The second, 7 nights in a villa at Hualalai.    Hualalai is a country club resort - I believe owned by Michael Dell. Part of the resort is The Four Seasons -- it is just mixed into the master plan of this beautiful community that is designed around lava fields. It is located on the Kona side of ""The Big Island."" It is just about 6 miles from the Kona International Airport.    Our children are 10 year old twins and a 6 year old. We enjoy staying in homes so that we can cook and not bother every day with breakfasts/lunches/dinner every day on long vacations and get a lot more space/bedrooms. But, we love resorts and so many times villas are the answer that are associated with resorts.    We rented a villa through ""Villas of Distinction"" with our AMEX Platinum travel agent. It is located in Hualalai and for an additional $50/day per person above 14 years of age - you get all access to The Four Seasons and Hualalai country club (just like Four Seasons guests). Plus you get a golf cart with a witty name to use. There is a wonderful gym, tennis, golf, and then, of course, all of the Four Seasons Pools.    Our stay was starting a peak travel period but since the pools have specific targets -- it never really feels that full. Plus, adults have an area away from the families which I'm sure they appreciate! Of course there is the kid's club and that's when parents can have alone time to do as they please.    We spent most of the time in King's Pond, the pool in the ocean (very creative), and the huge family infinity pool. The Four Seasons makes it very safe for children to snorkel and make it as authentic as possible.    I must say -- for 7 nights -- we could not imagine just staying at the resort. All of the Hawaiian islands offer so much we enjoy exploring, but, resort time is important, and we give ourselves enough days to do both.    For example -- my children will never forget going to Volcanoes National Park and seeing lava glow at night. Or my older son will not forget catching 150 pounds of Mahi Mahi with my husband off the Kona coast. The Hilo side of the island is just beautiful and quite different from where the resort is located. We also enjoyed a family session at Dolphin Quest.    We did make reservations for dinner one night at sunset at The Four Season's Ulu Grill. We really enjoyed our meal and we had a perfect table to enjoy the sunset.    So, if you want The Four Seasons, but, you want more room, a gourmet kitchen, etc. I highly recommend renting a villa at Hualalai. You can still get private catering, daily maid service, etc. if you want it -- it will just cost more. We would have paid the same or a bit less at The Four Seasons but we got so much more space and value, in our opinion, than staying at the hotel.    As usual, the staff at The Four Seasons is wonderful and most of the time would come up to ask for pool service. A few times we had to ask - especially at the family pool. Note: during peak travel times there is a clear pecking order to getting prime chairs: 1. Four Seasons guests 2. Hualalai villa owners 3. Renters of Hualalai villas (us). Only one time did that mean chairs a bit away from the prime area. Really not a big deal since we rarely sat in our chairs anyway and 'away' is just a few feet further. Again, this happened only once.    Just wanted to let everyone know that you have other options than staying at the actual Four Seasons -- you get more room, etc.    As on all the major islands -- there is Costco -- go there and stock up -- prices are about the same as mainland and it also carries local items.    Enjoy this resort!",Jul 2013,July 2013,Traveled with family,,"Austin, Texas"

166356791,40,Slightly disappointed,"This last trip to the four seasons Hualalai was my fifth visit in four years, so to say that I love this place is an understatement.    I'm going to point out a few negative things my Wife and I noticed this trip, this is the first time I've ever been disappointed with my trip to this resort. However, when you pay well over 2k per night, I think that gives you the right to express your concerns.    Again, since we frequent the hotel quite a bit, we're pretty up on things in regards to this resort. The one thing we noticed right away was the lack of experience at the sea shell swimming pool.    1.It's plainly obvious that most of the pool attendants are fairly new because the incredible pool service we've been accustomed to was greatly lacking. There was def a lack of leadership out there, too many new people without direction. This is not acceptable!    2. The rugs in our room had a lot of stains on it, and the outdoor shower was looking weathered.    3. I noticed more litter on the property than I have ever seen. Again, very disappointing.    Some positives    1. Food has gotten a lot better (the beach tree especially).    2. Housekeeping was great.    3. As always, the staff is extremely polite.    4. Still the best hotel that I've ever been to.",Jul 2013,June 2013,,,

166082443,50,Ticks all the boxes,"Having stayed at a few Four Seasons Resorts this would have to be my pick. Yes, it has all the usual amazing service around the hotel and poolside that you grow to love from Four Seasons, but here they cater for families on a whole new level. The resort is spread out so although you know it's full it never feels overcrowded. The only time was at breakfast where most days we waited for about 5 minutes for a table to be ready.    I have to say the buffet breakfast is one of the best we have ever enjoyed with great variety and the freshest foods on offer. The restaurants were all very good and varied, with the only minor comment being that the kids menu was fairly basic and bland, without any variation. Our kids ended up ordering from the adult menu.    Even though we spent a week at this amazing resort there were so many things our children didn't get to enjoy as the choices are endless. The favorites were walking along the coast in the mornings and seeing turtles resting on the rocks, snorkeling in the Kings Pond with the fish and rays, Luau, arts and craft activities, sports activities, spa and yoga sessions. The activities offered to the children was well catered for their ages of 10 & 11 years which is unusual as most hotels seem to focus on the younger children only. Yes there are lots of kids but due to the layout there is always somewhere to find a quiet spot if needed, including adult pools and isolated bays a few minutes walk away.    Ive noticed that other reviews have mentioned the extra cost with everything and yes this is true- but you get what you pay for and you do not have to choose the extra activities.

165963356,50,fantastic staff,"I just returned home from a wonderful stay at Four Seasons Hualalai. I have been to 4 seasons all over the world and while many of their resorts have way to many kids (this one does too), they have done a great job of trying to separate the resort so that the kids are on one side and adults are on the other. I also had a unique situation and one email to the GM, Robert, and the potentially ""bad"" day was taken care - four seasons to the rescue! Cory makes the BEST drinks at the adult pool and the staff at all of the restaurants were outstanding!!! The hotel manager (Adam) and the restaurant manager (Stephen - I think) had everything running perfectly. The ""tuna melt"" at the owners beach club was hands down the best I have ever eaten (L.J. another fantastic bartender). The next time I find myself on the Big Island, I will stay at this fantastic property. The rooms are great with views of the ocean from many, one draw back was the need to close blinds when changing or not wanting to feel ""on view"" as the rooms are in front of pools or playing green areas.

The service was fantastic.    The resort is beautiful, and is built into the natural landscape of Hualalai. There are basically no elevators anywhere as all the rooms are spread across the property, and you don't feel like you're at a hotel. We ate at all 3 restaurants for dinner.

164745611,50,What's not to like? Great Property and Staff,"After recommendations from multiple friends, we finally broke down and booked a week at the Four Seasons Hualalai, and we were glad we did! This was our first visit to the Big Island so we stopped off at an old lava vent on the way to the hotel to take pictures (you'll see it off the right a couple miles after leaving the airport). Once we arrived at Hualalai, we were greeted by a friendly guard and directed through the golf course and past the villas to the hotel reception area. Check-in was a breeze and a personalized experience where you are met outside and escorted to a seating area in the lobby. There, a staff member goes over your reservation and other hotel information while you enjoy a cold towel, fresh fruit and a fruit cocktail. All check-ins should be like that! Special shout-out to Erin S. in reservations who helped us with our booking before our arrival and ensured that our stay got off to a great start – thanks, Erin!    Our room was an Ocean View room in the King’s Pond building so our patio overlooked the pond and out to the ocean, which was nice. We had requested a ground floor room so that we would have an outdoor shower which was pretty cool and something that we actually used several times. The King’s Pond building is at the North end of the property so it is a walk from most of the pools, etc., but the amazing grounds make it an enjoyable walk to and from the room. Turn down service was a little inconsistent in terms of timing – sometimes early, once as last as 9:15pm. No big deal though as we had plenty of towels and could close our own shutters so if we got back to the room before housekeeping had been there, we’d just put the DND sign on the door and call it a night.    The spa facilities were very nice with separate areas for men and women with steam room, sauna, hot tub and cold plunge as well as three outdoor showers. We had two spa sessions during our stay (80-minute couple’s massage and 80-minute honey sugar scrub) and both were above average. You can also use the spa facilities as a hotel guest for free without booking a service which is nice.    We used all of the 5 pools at least once during our stay, but our favorite was the quiet pool (beach tree pool) located at the center of the resort. It is a salt-water pool, which we prefer over chlorine so that was nice. The tranquility pool (aka the adult pool) was nice too, especially since it has a swim-up bar, but we preferred a little more liveliness. The Sea Shell pool is the kids’ pool and has a waterfall and infinity edge. Great pool if you are visiting with kids. The pool service at all of the pools was impeccable as it is at most Four Seasons properties. We were never without a full cup of ice water and were never left wanting for fresh towels or food. All the staff, actually, were super friendly and attentive during our stay.    We also ate at all of the resort restaurants and had consistently great meals. My personal favorite was the Beach Tree restaurant which had great food, a laidback atmosphere and amazing sunset views. Having the breakfast buffet every morning at Ulu to look forward to also made getting out of bed every day a little easier.    Finally, we wanted to see a few sights off-property and the concierge was very knowledgeable and helped us book a helicopter tour of the volcano, which was a fun experience.

164539430,50,The Villas next door suited us better but overall the 4 Seasons was excellent but not perfect for our young family.,"We had stayed next door at the villas before staying at the hotel's prime ocean view one bedroom suite. The villa was a better choice and value for us. We could still use the hotel facilities and drive over on the golf cart. My family eats vegan, vegetarian and and a few eat fish, so having a kitchen to eat the way we like to was great. When we switched to the hotel suite eating at the restaurant twice a day became quite mundane. The kids menu consisted of unhealthy choices (fish and sticks, chicken fingers, mac and cheese, pizza), there were none to one vegan option on the menus at the three restaurants depending on which one we ate at. I had to get creative with the menu choices every time. Just relieved that I could be accommodated by the chefs to eat something. I would never make the food at home the same with all the oil, refined sugars and flour that was used. The hotel restaurants came very short of 'tropical fruits selections' most of the time the only choice was a melon salad with tired strawberries (half of the time served) and/or pineapple. No problem with obtaining this on the mainland! We hoped for mangos, papayas, lychees, apple bananas, star fruit and other exotic fruits. I also eat organic and wholemeal artisan breads. I had higher expectations from 5 star hotel restaurants. Aside from the food, the staff was excellent almost every time with the exception of Ulu buffet breakfasts.  The hotel facility was beautiful and very well maintained. The pool staff great 90% of the time with cold water served, menus, and towels. The only pool side service which ever fell short was Seashell's. Several times I picked up my towels from the huts for the family after waiting several minutes.  The concierge very helpful, knowledgable and friendly - Katherine was exceptional.  The spa services were excellent. The facility was well maintained and stocked.  The food cafe on the side of the tennis courts was very basic. The shakes are very average.  The valet and bell service was very organized, knowledgable and helpful. The people that work there enjoy it and it shows. The maid service was one of the best parts - morning and night room service!  The kids club was well run overall. The girls favorite teacher was Kenan since he involved himself with the kids the most. The kids had a great time in Kids Club and enjoyed the activities. If your child is under 5 a nanny is required which runs $20/hour plus extra fees.  We enjoyed having a look in the cultural center and enjoyed seeing turtles on the beach daily.

We wish we would have had more. This place is the perfect spot to relax and get away from it all - enjoy the amazing workout facility, numerous pools, golf and activities galore. For two consectutive afternoons we had an entire area of the beach to ourselves. We all got a kick outbof snorkeling in the King's pond, which our room overlooks. I would definitely request an upper level room surrounding this pond as it is super quiet because it is only open for swimming between 10AM and 4PM each day to reduce stress on the fish and ray who live in the pond. Private cabanas and Restaurants are good, as is service, especially frim beach side attendants. I'd give this place a 5 if housekeeping was a little more consistent - tonight's turn down service showed up at 9PM and service varied considerably the previous two nights -and the folks working at the Trading Post could find it within themselves to be friendly to to resort guests, instead of just residents.

Additionally, I had a sliver of an ocean view. I went by the desk and was told that there were ""ocean views"", Prime ocean views (which was what I was upgraded to), oceanfront and deluxe ocean front. For what I was paying, I was not happy with the view or location because the kids were up at 6 am. We did not get turndown service until almost 9:30 both nights we were there, and did not get our room cleaned until we called at 3:45. This was not what we expected at any hotel, much less the Four Seasons. Finally, we had dinner and had to ask for our check twice and the service was terrible.

We had a double length lanai where we could sit and enjoy morning coffee from fresh ground Kona beans or evening cocktails.

My only objection is that it feels a bit like a club that you need to be a member of to understand - maybe because they have a lot of repeat business and there are all the villa owners who come again and again, but everyone except us seemed to know one another and know the staff. Somehow this made it feel like you had to be 'in the know' to get the best restaurant bookings, tee times, spa reservations etc. It also felt a little like the staff we trying sooooo hard to be good, that you just wanted them to go away and leave you alone! That said, we did love the service at the adult pool, and welcomed the genuine first-person advice from the reception staff on which island tour to do.

163204939,40,Relaxing stay,"My husband and I stayed here for our wedding anniversary, and found it to be the perfect environment to kick back and relax in. Our prime ocean view room was great, with fantastic views over King's Pond. We barely left the resort during our 5 day stay and enjoyed relaxing by the pool, on our balcony, and walking along the beach front path every evening. And there are turtles on the beach just in front on the hotel (and a lot more on the beach further along the walking path)!    Both restaurants were great - really enjoyed the food and the service couldn't have been better. The cocktails at Beach Tree were fantastic, especially Tom's Pink Shirt. We had room service for breakfast and dinner a few times too and it was always set up nicely on our balcony. You can't beat having breakfast on your balcony seeing whales in the distance!    We enjoyed Beach Tree pool - great service and we had no problem getting lounge chairs when we wanted them (not early!). Good poolside food and drink service.    The one disappointing note was the service when we first arrived. I had requested a quiet room, and was disappointed to see the room we were first given was on the main path between the lobby and the pool, so the balcony wasn't private at all. It also didn't have a great view of the ocean for a prime ocean view room, and there was a vent for the restaurant nearby. Since we were planning to spend a lot of time on the balcony we weren't happy with this, and went back to the lobby to request a different room.    The person who had checked us in acted like we were being unreasonable in our request and snarkily asked where we would like to be situated, as all the prime ocean view rooms are the same and there is no better location. We left it with him (as we had not stayed there before we didn't know where a better location would be) and a few hours later were given a room overlooking King's Pond. Now this room was fantastic, with a much better ocean view and the balcony was clearly more private than the other room. We would not have been happy staying in the first room however, and did not appreciate being treated as though we were being difficult when we were not - it did not give us a very good first impression.    If you're looking for a quiet room, the ones overlooking King's Pond are good, and the ones in Palm Grove looked good also.

Then on our actual anniversary, they put a bottle of Chandon sparkling wine in our room. While not ""real"" champagne, it was still appreciated.    We got an upgraded room with an ocean view and view of the King's Pond, as well as an outdoor shower (which we used twice a day!). My only ""complaint"" is in the bathroom. The separate room for the toilet is nice, yes, but the door to the separate room is not great. First, it closes extremely loudly, which is a problem at night. Also, it is not a ""solid"" door--it has slats in it. This is a poor choice.

On the negative side, this resort is NOT CHEAP!! The prices for food and drinks on the resort are criminal. I would not go to this resort on my own bill. The other thing, is they kept telling us to be quiet - even the pool deck has signs that say ""quiet please"". Are you kidding?? This is a resort, where people are on holidays. I didn't get the concept behind that, especially we were there with 70 of us from our company, as a sales reward trip to celebrate our year of hard work. Why would a resort even want to cater to this kind of group, and then expect us to be quiet? This resort is stunning, but boring. Almost ""anti-fun"".

They think of everything here and it seems as if their goal is to not have you lift an unnecessary finger. We are major fans of the FS Maui but this is a cut above in service and much more serene. Our room was large and comfortable, the beds were sublime and the bathroom took it to another level with a fabulous outdoor lava rock shower---you could shower inside the bathroom if you prefer but open a door from the inside shower and walk out to a tropical garden literally your own back yard--surrounded by orchids and ferns and tropical flowers and turn on the shower and revel in the beauty of nature! No complaints here. The housekeeping was perfect and unobtrusive as well. The beach is not as nice as the FS Maui--very rocky--many sea urchins and really just a protected lagoon to swim in but the pools are lovely--the quiet pool was very quiet and the family pool--well--kids are there--yes they are loud but hey--it's a family pool! The Kings Pond is a cool and refreshing salt water pool full of tropical fish! The restaurants were amazing! Usually hotel food falls a bit below expectations but our breakfasts were fresh and delicious, we also did the farm to table dinner--wonderful in everyway and very recommended! The beach tree restaurant was fabulous too. You cannot go wrong dining here at all--there is really no need to leave the property.  It is expensive--very expensive- and if you are on a tight budget probably not the place for you though if you could swing a few days that is better than nothing.  The other stand out thing about this property that separates it from the FS Maui is that no one--I mean no one that works at this property has their hands out for tips--it is so uncomfortable to feel at the FS Maui that you tip from the valet to the beach boys, the pool attendants the concierge etc--and they expect it there in a very obvious way--the management there might want to take a look at that as it takes away from the total feeling of relaxation at FS Maui. Could it be that this FS Hualalai is just so over the top expensive--lowest room rates start around 795---that they can't expect that much more of the guests in terms of tipping for services you are paying a bunch for anyway??  As far as the crying children in some reviews--we really only experienced that at the family pool and the beach in front of it.

162732770,50,VERY expensive... whether it's worth it depends on how much you use of what is available.,"In a nutshell, this place is really very nice. Service is impeccable. We experienced NONE of the ""kid problems"" about which another traveler posted. Yes, we saw some kids.. not a lot, and they were not out of control. I would describe the clientele as at least 80% couples, possibly another 10% on business or with a business trip (saw quite a few corporate meetings... Toyota, among others, looked like they provided a trip to their top sales people), and maybe the last 10% is families. But I perceived the resort as primarily targeted towards couples.    All the restaurants on the premises were outstanding... food was consistently fantastic, as was the service.    The view we had was excellent, and we had an ocean ""front"" view... but it was much farther away from the ocean than the ocean ""front"" room we had at Koa Kea on Kauai. We could still hear the ocean at Four Seasons... but we traded off the ROAR of the ocean for a pretty view of their pond that lay between our room and the ocean. To me, it was a non-issue; to others, it may not be so unimportant.    One thing everyone will agree upon... the place is relatively expensive. Whether it's worth it depends on how much you use the considerable facilities that are available. Will you use the beach cabanas? Will you be spending your time primarily at the Four Seasons, or will you be spending a lot of your time off-site? The exercise rooms and facilities are all first-rate... will you use them? Many, many swimming pools... including one with live fish in it.... will you use them? They have something like 8 tennis courts... do you play?    Probably the biggest criticism I have of the Four Seasons at Hualalai is that, after having strolled the property quite a few times, I felt there was A LOT of facilities available to me in which I really had minimal interest, but which I was obviously paying for. Perhaps you are one who likes to ""have the option"" if it is available... then it may be worth it. For us, we like the first-class service that is a trademark of all Four Seasons... but you know what? We got the same first-class service on Kauai at the Koa Kea, but without all the facilities we didn't use, for less than half the price per day! Over a one- or two-week stay, that can add up to lots of money! So think about it.    I think the Four Seasons is a fantastic respite... pretty much everything is first-class. Rooms are great, service is fantastic, food is outstanding. Location is good. The biggest question a traveler needs to weigh is the cost-benefit relationship... Four Seasons has lots of facilities and services... that all adds to the cost of staying there. Do you use those services? If not, you may want to shop around to find another place that has similarly great guest services and restaurants but perhaps without the amenities you do not use.

Since it was our first time going to Big Island, as we were landing were shocked at how barren and black (because of the lava rock) the scenery was on the island. Especially because we were coming from our first stop in Kaua'i. Once we entered the area of where the Four Seasons is located we were very pleased to see so much vegetation!    Definitely a unique property compared to the one in Maui. Love the separate bungalows and the grounds of this property is beautiful, so scenic. Fyi their lot is expansive! So having access to being shuttled around on golf cart is great.    The Four Seasons service is definitely one that you cannot beat anywhere.

162371463,30,Tropical Daycare,"I wanted so much to love this resort. It seemed perfect for us, and as Four Seasons enthusiasts it was a no-brainer. I wanted this resort to be our go-to for quick getaways. We left the kids with Grandma to celebrate our wedding anniversary and to enjoy a quiet and romantic five night vacation. This resort is beautiful. The beds were very comfortable. The service at every point is exquisite. Food quality is outstanding. The service at the quiet pool was impeccable and the service for the round of golf for my husband was flawless. We were invited to a Manager’s Reception, which was very nice. We loved all of this, but the major problem is that the resort is overrun with kids.    There were children running wild everywhere at the resort. Management did its best to help us, but at some point the real problem needs to be addressed. This resort tries to appeal to couples, corporate events, and to families. It doesn’t work. Four Seasons operates only two restaurants on site, Beach Tree and Ulu Grill. This is a major source of the trouble. Couples cannot get away from kids. The Hualalai Grille is operated by a different company. I reviewed the restaurants separately on Tripadvisor.    While at the resort, here is what we saw…    -There were many naked kids and kids wearing only diapers or underwear roaming throughout the resort. As cute as I think my kids are when they are naked, it is inappropriate for kids to be naked in public.    - The constant drone of kids whining and crying could be heard all over the resort.    - Kids were riding bikes on the walkways at the resort. I was told that this is not allowed, and yet guests were doing it anyway. It would be great if the Four Seasons would enforce their own rules.    - There were babies in diapers with their parents in the lap swimming pool at the spa.    - There were toddlers in diapers and babies screaming their lungs out in the quiet pool. The Four Seasons didn’t seem interested in maintaining the quiet, I guess.    - We saw toddlers roaming around inside the Ulu Grill barefoot and wearing just diapers.    - There were soiled diapers left in the Beach Tree restroom. The lack of consideration for other guests was apparent throughout the resort.    - Kids were playing tag on the grass directly outside the guest rooms at 6:10 am. Can the resort impose quiet hours like apartment complexes and dorms have?    - Strollers were parked in front of guest rooms throughout the resort. Many guests seemed to treat this resort as a low rent apartment complex and not a five star resort.    -While napping in my room in the afternoon, I was abruptly woken up by blood curdling screams. I walked out on my patio to find a woman dragging her naked kids across the lawn. I was shocked and speechless. She yelled “I am having a standoff with my kids”. While I understand that kids have meltdowns etc, this public standoff was just another reminder that this resort was not for us.    -I saw a parent take her baby’s diaper off in the outside public shower adjacent to the kids pool. After inspecting the baby’s backside, she held the baby up to the shower head to rinse away the filth that was on the baby and presumably in the soiled diaper. It was like hosing down livestock on a farm.    If you are fine with all of the above, you will have a great time here because, as I said, the resort is beautiful and the service is outstanding, for the most part. There are a lot of families and corporate event travelers who think this resort is superb. If my work had paid for this vacation, I suppose I wouldn’t have anything to complain about. For us, we spent about $7,000. We realized that we made a mistake by choosing this resort. We were looking for a romantic and peaceful getaway.

162289719,50,VIP Helicopter Experience Extraordinaire,"The title says it all. There is no other way to describe this unbelievable event that Four Seasons Resort Hualalai is about to unveil for it’s guests on the Big Island. My family had a birthday celebration for our daughter and wanted to do something special. Leave it to Guest Event Director, Damon Stirling, to come up with a sneak preview of an absolutely awesome day. I must confess that my husband and I love Hualalai and come back many times a year, but WE NEVER LEAVE THE PROPERTY - ever - but I recommend this VIP Experience to everyone. We felt as if we were in the middle of a movie set for most of the day. I guarantee you will never experience anything like this - ANYWHERE.    We took off by helicopter mid morning and the entire day unfolded as a surprise. Destination unknown, but it turned out to be a tour of the Big Island by sky that included active volcanoes and endless fields of black lava with steam rising from the ocean as lava met water at 2500 degrees! There were lush forests, magnificent waterfalls as tall as one could see, valleys of green foliage and a palette of turquoise waters along the coastline. Picture perfect as we viewed 11 out of 13 climate zones found in the world in a matter of minutes.    We landed on a private farm and were treated to a four course meal after a tour with owners Mike and June. Executive Sous Chef Nick from Four Seasons greeted us on arrival with cocktails as we exited the helicopter. Did Chef really make ice cubes using fresh lime juice squeezed hours earlier from limes picked from the tree just steps away?    Cocktails in hand, we toured the grounds and saw endless varieties of fresh pineapples (which we picked for lunch), limes, bananas, 8 foot tall bushes of cinnamon, allspice, sugar cane and every herb, and fresh fruit grown on the island. I had never seen a cinnamon tree before!    Chef Nick then prepared a four course meal and paired Louis Roederer champagne with our salad dish, Kistler white wine for our homemade pasta with fresh tomatoes, basil and Parmeggiano Reggiano, and Chateau Montelena for our grilled steak and sauteed mushroom platter. Of course, our dessert of creme brulee was topped with fresh pineapple from the nearby garden that we picked minutes before.    Oh, did I mention that Chef Nick and his assistant, Taihani, brought EVERYTHING from the hotel that was 1 1/2 hours away by car? Yes, our dreamy location, which resembled a stage set from Tuscany. Everything brought from the hotel, including our table, chairs, plates, flatware and wine glasses. YES, Chef Nick also included a makeshift kitchen, complete with grill. YES, Chef Nick even prepared homemade pasta dough and brought a hand cranked pasta maker to the table to let one of our guests actually make the pasta as we sipped our wine! This man has a flair for the dramatic and guests loved being included in his show!    Everyone expects impeccable service and extraordinary experiences from the Four Seasons. Specifically, the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai was named #1 Hotel In The World by Traveler’s Choice 2013. The addition of VIP Experiences Extraordinaire will take this Four Seasons to a whole new level.

162111242,30,Series of Unfortunate Events Followed by Moments of Greatness...,"When you see that a hotel has been voted ""#1 hotel in the world"" you expect greatness but what we found the minute we arrived was more like shattered dreams...We recently went on an award incentive trip...but at the end of the day the trip is really on us because we get 1099'd for the cost (i.e. it is treated like a bonus which we subsequently get taxed on...it is like getting the bonus and then forking it out on vacation the minute you get it). When we arrived we had a great room and a great view but there was one odd thing...it was two double beds and not the king that we requested. Now, for a young married couple...on vacation...away from their children...this is a big problem. When we went to the ""help"" desk to see about a change what we found was far from help. Four Seasons was busy pointing the finger at the organizer and the organizer was busy pointing the finger at Four Seasons...the whole time we were in the middle being totally ignored and literally told to suck it up and deal with it...not really what you expect from a hotel known for their five star service and one that was voted #1 in the world. After we ""sucked it up"" we found the services to be hit or miss and what I would consider far from stellar as compared to what we have seen at the other Four Seasons in Hawaii (Lanai and Maui). It took far too long to get service (it could take upwards to an hour to get a cocktail or your food) while at the pool and beach side and you were paying $20 for a drink that seemed to have no alcohol in it...to top it off one day we ordered a crown and ginger with a lime (pretty simple) at the pool that took three people to figure out how to make it which we knew because they had to keep coming back to ask what it was we wanted exactly...as our 6 day trip went on things got better but nobody at the hotel ever circled back to let us know about a room change (which they said they would look into and get back to us on), to ask how our stay was or to apologize to us for telling us to ""suck it up"" and deal. And on top of it all we found out that we were not the only ones having issues...we had some friends of ours that were there at the same time and when they checked in they were given the key to their room only to find that there was already a couple sleeping in the room that they had been assigned....again...not what I call five star and top notch service giving someone a key to a room already occupied...they were however given some beer to ""make it all better"" on a trip that was all inclusive for us and booked to a master account to be 1099'd out to us later...not exactly making amends in my mind when I go to my room at midnight only to find someone in it...or heaven forbid being the couple asleep in the bed and have complete strangers walk in...and then being given beer to compensate for it when everything is already all inclusive...As for the view and surroundings, absolutely beautiful! And the food and drinks...when we finally did get them they were wonderful and creative...but overall we left disappointed...maybe we just set our expectations too high...",May 2013,May 2013,Traveled as a couple,,"LaGrange, Georgia"

You could probably find better deals if you search for it as our room included breakfast and free Wi-Fi. What a deal! I could not find fault with anything. Good food, service, excellent facilities, etc. I played golf everyday at the Jack Nicklaus course which was excellent (for only $250 per day.)  The best restaurant is ULU which serves breakfast and dinner (expensive but good.) The Beach Tree and The Beach House are my favorite restaurants. The Surf Shack is great for morning coffee, smoothies, Panini's, etc,  The beach is lava filled, however, if you walk over to the Kona Village area which is under construction you'll discover a nice sandy cove for beach lovers.

Four Seasons Maui was also nice but Hualalai was so much better in terms of setting and overall look and feel. Hualalai makes you feel like you are in paradise. Although Big Island wasn't my most favorite out of the Hawaiian Islands, I would go back to Big Island just to stay at this hotel. I loved it so much that I am seriously considering having a destination wedding there next year. Service was also great -- everyone was so friendly. We were also lucky enough to have our ocean view room upgraded to prime ocean view suite. The balcony was so huge that there were days I sunned myself there instead of the beach (and the views from balcony were great). The only bad thing is, I was spoiled at Four Seasons Hualalai and now the bar is set high and all hotels I stay at out will be compared to this.

160400467,50,A Cut Above,"We have thought about staying at the Four Seasons Hualalai for many years. But seeing that it was voted #1 Hotel in the World for 2013 by TripAdvisor members ended our indecision. What an honor, wow! We had to go! We booked an 8 night stay.    You can find fancier, pricier and more exotic places around the world to stay. But all things considered, this is one of the loveliest resorts we have ever experienced.    The main reason is the service. The personnel. Superb. Special thanks to Rheba, Florian and Gilles for making us feel so welcomed and appreciated. There are so many wonderful people that work there and I wish I had made a list of all of their names. But every valet, housekeeper, groundskeeper, gym attendant and concierge made us feel very special and we want to thank you all.    My husband unfortunately had business issues that arose unexpectedly during our stay. He needed a conference room, a computer and a conference call line. And this was needed at 5 am. Kent, the IT Director, was on top of it and bent over backwards to be sure my husband was comfortable with the set up and had everything he needed at his fingertips.    I also want to mention how great the golf staff is. My husband had the opportunity to play 2 18-hole rounds and also played 9 holes with the pro, Ken. The entire staff (cart attendants, starters and all the professionals) were absolutely fabulous.    We have stayed at the Four Seasons in Maui and that property is wonderful as well. But Four Seasons Hualalai was voted #1 in the world for good reason. It is a cut above. We will see you again.",May 2013,April 2013,Traveled as a couple,,"El Dorado Hills, CA"
160364188,50,A Perfect Hawaiian Paradise,"Our recent 8 night stay (April 18 to 26) at the FS Hualalai was exactly what we needed after a long Canadian winter. Arrival/check-in was fast, friendly and personable. It feels like we have arrived home when we enter the lobby. Our room wasn't quite ready since we arrived early, but off to the Beach Tree restaurant for an amazing lunch.    Our room for the week, an amazing golf view suite, was our favourite room so far. Location is out of the way, but this only means more privacy, quiet and lovely walks to dinner and pool. You still have ocean views, and the added bonus of golf course views too. We had a rental car for the week so it was great to be able to park our car directly outside our room. Some days it felt like we were returning to our own home after a day of exploring (I wish!).    The bed was extremely comfortable as it always is, if not a little on the tall side. (I’m short). During our stay they launched the new eco-friendly (sustainable) reusable pump bottle soaps/shampoos (The Hawili project). The scent is very unique (Hawaiian-smelling), but I was instantly in love and the shampoo was awesome and the body creams were exceptional.    This suite has two full washrooms, a large living room/desk area and large bedroom. The closet area is huge (with many drawers) and the front hall also had a large closet. I wouldn't change a thing about this room. Our housekeeping was done promptly and efficiently by Celeste each morning at 10 a.m. If you have special preferences regarding time, please call housekeeping when you arrive. We also requested additional bottled water at turndown and this was done each night. We used the hotel’s pressing service – wow, they were quick and good. Also, used self-service laundry twice (they provide laundry soap and dryer sheets). This is such a luxury for a hotel to have this added bonus. Thanks FS!    I had a pedicure at the spa on the first day. It was average at best, and be warned, they put you in a chair that tilts you backwards (almost like a dentist chair). For someone with back issues this was intolerable, I had to ask sternly to be put back up. I don’t think the technician was impressed but I was ready to bolt from the chair altogether.    Our days were lazy and relaxing. Breakfast at 'Ulu was very good. Loved the waffles and coconut scones. Some days would switch it up and have salmon and rice or miso soup. I love that I can have Asian food at breakfast! DH was determined to eat his share of bacon and sausage. It really has everything you could ask for. We were on the breakfast plan, as we booked using a four seasons preferred partner, so it was included in our rate. However, to justify the $85 buffet charge (for 2), you have to really bring your appetite. Some mornings seating was a challenge, as most require shaded chairs and prefer outside seating. Breakfast hostesses handle the crowds with ease and grace. The waiters are lovely and remember us each morning.    Lots of children on this trip but mostly well behaved and under control. Mornings were a challenge to find a quiet table, but that was probably because of too many cocktails the evening before. Since we are on the topic, children, especially small children, can be found in abundance at this hotel. At Beach Tree during dinners this is usually okay, since most go over to the lawn area and stay out of the way. It’s actually quite nice to see them having a great time, dancing, doing hula, climbing on the now fallen beach tree. The only major issue is when there is a crying baby, and the family doesn't feel the need to go for a walk. This happened only a few times, but enough to ruin a portion of the meal.    We spent most mornings exploring the island, and back to the main Beach Tree pool in the afternoon for an hour or so. We are not really pool people, but the service is great, and the snacks/drinks are perfect. Some mornings we would do laps in the spa pool and that was so refreshing and cool. However, the Beach Tree pool was way too warm, uncomfortably so. We joked with staff each day to express our displeasure, but honestly, I don’t think they will change this. But, if I could change one thing for the entire week, that would be it! Please make the pool cooler.     We did most dinners at the Beach Tree and had impressive meals. Don’t forget to make your dinner reservations in advance, as most restaurants are booked up each evening. The bar is fun for a pre-dinner cocktail. Try Tom’s Pink Shirt or Freddie’s Broken Flipper - Our favs for the week. The bartenders are all really kind and warm, but especially looked forward to seeing Tom and Juli. Dinners (and lunches) at Beach Tree were consistently good to excellent. Highlight was the night Chef Nick decided to set up an impromptu pasta station. The amazing dish had fresh local fish and handmade pasta. DH raved about the short ribs and lobster pasta.    We also tried ‘Ulu on the second night, so maybe it was the jet lag, but we just weren’t impressed. The portion sizes are very small, and the quality, in our opinion, wasn’t better than Beach Tree (although the prices are considerably higher). DH had the wild boar and it was overcooked and at least 50 % fat. Probably should have sent back, but we were too tired to complain. The highly acclaimed soufflé was just way too “eggy” and not enough flavor. The crab pot stickers as an appetizer was the highlight of the night. We will probably give ‘Ulu another try on our next visit. (service was good!)    I celebrated my birthday on this trip and was given several lovely treats throughout the day. It was so nice and special, I just can’t say enough about how kind they are. Complimentary desserts, wine, unique and fragrant lei. It was a memorable day, and I am grateful to the hotel staff (especially Janelle) for making me feel so special.    We did several day trips on this visit. A relaxing drive to Waipio Valley Lookout which was amazing, and a nice scenic drive out to Hawi, the birthplace of King Kamehameha. We also did some pretty great snorkeling at Puako and Honaunau Bay. We did the hotel sponsored snorkel trip with Alaka’I Nalu (130.00 per person) for a 2 hour snorkel. We had such an amazing time on our last trip we were very much looking forward to this. The good news is that they now have a different entry beach that will pick you up at the hotel and drive you to. The tour is pretty much the same as before, nothing new, so for us it wasn’t as much fun. I think they spend a disproportionate amount of time “chasing” the dolphins, and for those newbies, they were ecstatic, but we were looking for some good snorkeling. I won’t go into too much detail about the new Captain Jimmy, other than to say he comes across as a loud mainlander. This was completely opposite to our experience with Hawaiian local Daniel from the previous trip.    The Four Seasons Hualalai is an amazing property, with exceptional service, and lovely, warm, accommodating staff. As others have said, the word “No” does not exist at this hotel. If you pick the right time of year (April, October, November, early December), this hotel can be a relaxing oasis of pampered perfection. What else can one ask for?

Mostly small issues, like a sunblock being broken by house keeping, raw chicken at dinner or poor service at the family pool/beach. Noisy guests having a wild party late at night...  Without asking, the product was shipped to my home. The chicken was taken off our bill and the service improved greatly, after pointing it out. This desire to please us by making changes and rise to the standard we have come to love about this resort, is why we keep returning.  Jasen at the ""sno-cone"" stand is a top notch employee. He not only remembered us, but made us feel very welcome. Same goes for the staff at the quiet pool. Nicolette was a favorite. She anticipated our needs and then some. She would make a great manager one day.  The Residents Beach Club is a gem. Quiet, gorgeous views and solid menu items make it a perfect spot. The Ulu has a much better menu and the wine offerings were lovely. Great vanilla bean soufflé.  Best dessert- ginger cookie and strawberry ice cream sandwiches  at the adult pool. Delish!  This resort is serene, lush and exactly what I want when I think of Hawaii.    P.S. I highly recommend the Nalu sports at the resort- all if the fun of snorkeling, scuba without the boat trip.

This is the only place at the resort where swimming in the ocean would be possible. There are wonderful tidepools to explore along this part of the beach though and many different kinds of shells to inspect.

159647621,40,Hardly left the resort!,"Truly, this is one of the loveliest properties I have ever seen. We checked in on April 25th and left April 28th, but I left the resort only twice. Once to pickup my rental car, and the second to try and use the rental car with a short trip into town for some goodies.    We were placed in a bungalow on the far end of the resort, where the King's Pond is, and it had great ocean views of the sunset and lapping waves hardly 30 feet away. Our balcony faced the pond, which was a nice gazing point. We even had turtles resting regularly right at the end of the path to the beach. I saw at least 3 every single day!    I definitely loved being at the end of the resort, which meant very little foot traffic, but we were close to every single restaurant by just taking the beach path right outside. I could leave the balcony doors open to hear the waves crashing, but nary a noisy person or any other disturbances that are typical of a resort. I sleep very lightly and can't tolerate disturbances in the night. Once I'm awake, Im awake 100% and it takes another 30 minutes for me to feel sleepy again. Did not have that problem here!    Being outside Kings Pond was great too, though the snorkeling experience seems a little too contrived. They do have a pretty big eagle ray in there and ridiculously large fish, but I didn't find it too interesting compared to snorkeling in the wild. Its great for newbie snorkelers who want to get comfortable in a controlled environment first!    Service was hit of miss for us. Some was great, some was bad. My boyfriend was able to order a smoothie from his chair ont he sands of King's Pond, but when I came to join him, I was told I could get a smoothie from the Shake Shack that turned out to be a 15 minute walk to and back. Only when I came back did by boyfriend tell me, with a note of surprise, that they brought it to him! Okay... why make me go get it then?    We also found the Adult Pool to be heavily pretentious. All the chairs were taken and we walked over to the little towel booth to ask about availability. Four of the empty chairs on the beach were apparently reserved for the rooms on the oceanfront and the attendant said she would allow us to sit on the lawn chairs that are usually reserved for the Day beds that coast $100 for just the daybed use of $300 for the package that included wine water. I thanked her, and she put me on a waitlist and sent someone else out to give us covers for the chairs while we waited for something on the beach to open up.    Wow, this girl clearly hated us and detested the fact we existed. Did I spit in your bean curd in a another life? She made a point of snarkily telling us again that we usually aren't allowed to use these chairs ON THE LAWN WITH NO VIEW, but they are making a gracious exception. I said I was thankful and appreciated the exception and she smirked rather than smiled. Okay, I'm nice, not blind. She will be back with a menu shortly. Not. She never appeared again, never asking if we wanted water or anything from the bar. 30 minutes passed, nothing. My dear, I may not be wearing a Louis Vuitton swimsuit or toting a Goyard or Gucci tote while adjusting my Hermes sunglasses, but if I am here at your resort and if I've provided my room number proving I am a PAYING guest at this hotel, you need to reverse that attitude. The room comes with at least the pretense that you are stoked at my presence at this resort. A 5 second smile won't hurt your face. If I am bring nice to you, you should be nice to me. Simple.    We beat it outta there asap and went to the Seashell pool where the service was impeccable. Super nice attendants who beat me to the chairs I picked out with covers, towels and cold ice water. They came back several times over the next tours with cold towels, pineapple skewers, ice water and little cups of ice cream nuggets. What a big difference 30 feet makes.    Housekeeping was on it like a team of ninjas!!! We didn't have our Do Not Disturb signs while we were out, but sometimes we hung out late in the room up until 1-2PM with no knock on the door for housekeeping. However, as soon as we were out the door, they must have swooped in and hustled! We left our room at 1PM and returned at 3:30PM to find it immaculate. Several times, we saw this at random hours. We never came back to see the room as we left it.    I even made a passing comment to our waitress at the 'Ulu grill that I didn't have a coffeemaker in my room and wanted a hot cup of water for my tea. She brought me the hot water and before we even made it back to our room 10 minutes later, she had housekeeping set up my coffee station with pot on our counter. Whoa! It was then explained to me the next day that the coffeemaker/station was kept in the drawer at the bottom of the counter. Oops, I didn't even check...    Breakfast buffet at the 'Ulu grill is great and the selection is super plentiful from Japanese breakfast with delectable salmon, rice and miso soup to Taro Banana pancakes, custom omelet stations, all sorts of meats for the happy carnivore as well as the self serve parfait station. Oh, the the papaya. OH...THE PAPAYA.    Most of the time, service was pretty stellar.

If you are a golfer (I am not), it has access to a great looking course. The multiple pools here are large and there was never a problem getting a chair. The beach was pretty, not the best beach in the world as it is pretty rocky. The hotel built a barrier wall to break the waves and control currents.

159400363,50,Number 1 hotel for good reason!,"Went to the four season's hualalai for my parent's 40th wedding anniversary. They did a great job from trying to call us by our name the moment we stepped out of our rental car, to being given a mai tai, cool towels and fruits while checking in. Everything was so personable. I have a 2.5 year old and 8 month old so I cannot attest to all the other reviews which poo poo on too many kids at the resort. I can say that there is an adult pool with a swim up bar that I would have loved to go to but the other pools were just fine and if pools aren't your thing then you either snorkel the King's pond (rather frigid!) or swim in the lagoon!    Epitome of a resort, worth every dime. Had a ground floor room, ocean facing and enjoyed the outdoor shower in the back almost every day. My wife said the only drawback was the lack of ""authenticness"" and as she was wishing she saw more Hawaiian workers or had more of the Hawaii feel someone came by blowing a conch and the tiki torches lit up.

159374872,50,The best stay ever,"I first got the chance to stay at the Four Seasons Hualalai a few years (had to choose a travel date for the posting and I can't choose a date older than June 2012, so the date is off) back when my wife's company had a function there. The resort is a bit off central, then again, most nice, beautiful hotels/resorts are off the busy downtown. Once you are in the Four Seasons Hualalai, you will not want to go anywhere else but stay in the resort property. The property is surrounded by ancient volcanic lava rocks and the pacific ocean. There are many activities available for you to enjoy.    You could explore the volcanic rocks on one part of the property or explore the fish pond (great family fun) that's conveniently located on property or take a dive in the open air swimming pool that over look the beach or just relax and enjoy the sun or have a round of golf or take a daily walk along the private beach (don't be surprise to find large Hawaiian green turtles resting on the beach). And how about a Hawaiian massage in private open air setting. Did I mention breakfast by the sea? And yes, the food is great, so is the service.    The weekend that we were there was totally not enough. We didn't want to leave. Luckily, we got another chance to visit Hualalai a year later and the feeling is still the same. We love it. This is one of those places that once you checked in you just want to stay forever.

159300080,50,"Perfect setting, perfect service, too many kids...","We stayed here April 14-21, we booked a Superior Suite Oceanfront which was huge (1000 SF) and decorated well. We arrived at 2pm and our room was ready. We liked having a separate living room as hubby had to do some work a few mornings before we went to the pool/beach. We had 2 baths, one fabulous bath with huge separate shower, oversized tub, walk in closet and one bath that just had a shower but great for getting ready at the same time for dinner. We experienced all the pools but loved the adult pool which was quieter and the food and drink service was excellent. There were always plenty of chairs for us to choose from in our area of choice each day, we arrived around 9:30am, which at some resorts you can't find anything but ""off to the side"" if you arrive later than 7am... We ate lunch at the pool everyday and found plenty of choices on the menu, from healthy to not so healthy, but all yummy. Dinners at Ulu, Beach House and the Grill were top notch in setting, service and food quality/ quantity. We had a couples massage which was expensive but great. It was convenient to where we went scuba diving (10 minute car ride). We loved the lobby at night after dinner to people watch and relax with a final glass of wine. The shop has cute swimsuits and active wear. We golfed 1 afternoon, we are not ""golfers"" so we thought the course was beautiful and way hard but I'm sure better golfers have better comments. Our room was always cleaned by 12n and we like extra bath towels and requested them at check in, they always gave us extra towels each day without forgetting our preference. Yes, this resort is expensive but soooo,worth it. The pampering they provide is unmatched.    The only negative (for us) was there were ALOT of kids. We thought by mid April, spring break would be done but obviously not...next time we will wait until the beginning of May. It wasn't really that there were alot of kids as much as the parents that did not keep an eye on their kids or let  their kids act up/out big time. Not the resorts fault...

We spent 5 days and felt like we barely scratched the surface of the resort--each of the 5? 6 ? pools were beautiful and had a completely different character, the beach stretched the entire length of the property and every sight line from every chair and every chaise provided stunning views of the sea and nature. The whales breaching and sea turtles coming ashore became almost commonplace! We loved the spa and the gym. Our meals were tremendous.

158960407,50,The Spirt of Aloha,"I have sat down several times to write this review but honestly could not find the words to describe our experience at the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai. We arrived on Friday, March 1, after spending a few days in San Francisco. The flight was good but after flying 5 ½ hours and the time change, we were ready to relax. Driving into the resort compound, gave us a sense of the lavish vacation we were about to experience. When we arrived at the resort, we were respectfully greeted by two of the concierge staff. As we sat in the lobby area going over our accommodations’, we were given refreshments and a cold towel to “freshen up” after our flight. We then were whisked away to a beautiful pool view suite that was beyond our expectations. The room was bright and beautiful decorated. It was very clean and you could tell that it was always well serviced. During our stay, housekeeping was always there to help us in any way that would add to our comfort.  The amenities at the resort were amazing. My husband was so excited to find out that the Four Seasons had their own snorkeling pond. I was equally happy to know that each bungalow had an area close by with its own washer and dryer along with complementary laundry detergent. Soaking up some sun and fun at the pool areas were wonderful. We spent time at the adult pool enjoying peaceful afternoons after some morning site seeing. The pool area was always kept clean and the staff was very friendly and always eager to please.  The food was excellent! The breakfast buffet was one of the largest that I have ever seen with a wide variety of food. We ate at both the Beach Tree and 'ULU Ocean Grill for dinner. Both restaurants had excellent food with ocean views and atmosphere that were unsurpassed. While there, we made up our minds that there would be no reason for us to leave the resort for dinner, as the Four Seasons satisfied our every need.  We did not have time to use the spa or golf facilities, but we will remedy that on our next visit. I forgot to mention, that this was our first visit to Hawaii. We had planned this trip to celebrate our 32nd wedding anniversary. This was going to be our “trip of a lifetime” as we would probably never return to Hawaii. However, after staying at the Four Season in Hualalai we are committed to returning to this island paradise that embraces the true aloha spirit.

158197235,50,Amazing. Like heaven.,"What can I say? Absolutely incredible. We usually don't do all-out high end trips like this, and our previous week in Maui was amazing so we figured no WAY could we top that. However we were blown away at the experience. We went with our 3 children ages 18 (had his 18th birthday at the resort), 14, and 11. After an action packed week in Maui of scuba, whale watching, a luau, biking down a volcano, driving the Road to Hana, etc we were ready to be pampered. We planned on going to see the volcano on Hawaii but to be honest we had such a great time at the resort we never left. Not once.    We were there for a week and the attention to detail and service was top notch. We spent the first few days by the kiddie pool and then moved to the other pool (not realizing it was the quiet pool, sorry about that) which was also amazing. We thought the adult pool was the quiet pool, so we were definitely heard at the quiet pool until someone pointed that out to us. :)    The food was great, we pretty much ate lunch by the pool every day and the service was great. The one day the service was slow someone came out to apologize to us about the delay. It was ok, we hadn't even complained, but they PROACTIVELY came out to tell us the food would be delayed. I was impressed. The evenings were spent at the restaurants on the grounds, all were pretty damn good. Definitely make a reservation, they fill up quickly unless you don't mind waiting until 9pm to eat. We didn't mind, we were still on NY time but we learned to make a reservation for the days we wanted to eat at a regular time.    I also wanted to point out someone on the staff (Drew Brandwein) who was a manager or a supervisor of the pool/food staff. He was amazing. His attention to detail as he worked his way around the pool checking on all the customers was greatly appreciated. We had a 10pm flight out on the red eye and he arranged for an awesome picnic basket for us as we left for the airport. Definitely ask around to see if Drew is working, he was very helpful and gave us great advice on all the things to see and do at the resort.    Everything was top notch. The scenery and the sunsets are as you can imagine. Remember to walk all the way to the left, past the golf courses (good running trail) and you will be blown away. We went for a few miles until we came upon another beach. Take your camera too. I took nearly 2000 pics that week. Make sure you are near the beach at sunset so you can get those once in a lifetime pics. People are all lined up there to get pics so it's easy to ask someone to take your pic, everyone was so helpful.    Maybe it's because you are in paradise, maybe it's because you are being pampered and spoiled, and maybe it's because, well, you're not at work but I thought this resort was one of the best overall experiences of my life (and the family agreed).    The details make it worth it, and while I can't remember everything off the top of my head they did things like come around the pool and serve you treats like ice pops, water (your water glass is never more than half empty), little chocolate truffle things, fresh fruit, and much more. The capper was there is a girl who comes around whose sole job is to clean your sunglasses for you. Yes, someone comes around and cleans your sunglasses of all the smudges and suntan oil and food you got on your nice shades.",Apr 2013,February 2013,Traveled with family,,"Huntington Station, New York"
158166483,50,Useful tips,"This is one of the best resorts in the world, so instead of saying that again, here are some things that might be useful:    - Contrary to some other reports here, you are in no way obliged to tip the staff. Please don't unless someone really has gone way above what is expected. Unlike in a lesser hotel, none of the staff I have encountered over my past stays here were expecting a tip.    - The self-service laundry facilities are very good. I'd really recommend using them.    - There's no need to reserve anything at the pool or anywhere else on 99% of the days of the year. Of course, if you're going during one of the main vacation periods, things can get a little busier. This is maybe the case on 2 weeks during the entire year.    - Breakfast in 'ULU is great. Not that expensive and very, very good.    - Book through a Virtuoso agent rather than directly. If you book through Virtuoso, you get the same rates plus something like $100/day dining credit and a room upgrade.    - The golf course provides excellent lessons even for complete novices.    And as I've said before, unless you're used to this kind of luxury, you will find yourself constantly wondering if you're missing something or could do something more (such as reserve spaces at the pool). The point of this place is to not have to worry about anything. Misplaced your bag at reception? Don't worry, it will show up in your room. Just enjoy yourself.",Apr 2013,March 2013,Traveled solo,,"San Francisco, California"
157981414,50,wow,"We stayed with Hualalai as the reviews were so fantastic. Our trip started on 30th March until 12th April. As we booked so late, we moved our rooms about three times, it was a bit of pain but at the same time, we got to experience many different rooms. We liked the golf course/sea view suite the best, incredibly spacious and loved the steam room. The two delux sea view rooms on Kings Pond was nice and the best of this is that you can isolate yourselves on a little sunbathing plot. Then the interconnecting rooms, suite to a deluxe room next to LU restaurant was also nice but the big live pond needs to be cleared out to really feel special, but probably most convenient location to the restaurants and gym/spa.  We arrived and realised that the hotel was at its full capacity(Spring break for the Americans and us, Brits were also on Easter break) the hotel gives preferences to their residents who own villas there. Every morning, we had to reserve sun beds and restaurants as it was absolutely full and packed. There was a sense of buzz around the hotel and a little bit chaotic but interestingly, the service in restaurants and room service/house keeping did not suffer at all. The pool staff and staff in general, all were at their 100%, this might be due to the immense tipping you are obliged to do. However, I guess this method works because happy staff and happy client?  We were the only Brits there so we kind of kept to ourselves and we are more used to smaller hotels so we were rather over whelmed by the bigness and loudness of the hotel(not in a bad way but in positive). Everyone was in their morning jogging outfits, looking fit and made effort to dress right etc.  Did not experience kids club(my children did not want to join as they felt shy) but did do the Easter egg hunt(incredbly competitive with many pushy parents, funny to experience) which was very luxurious and well organised and looked very pretty set up. The kids club menu looked good but many interesting events had to be paid, quite expensive.  We chose Hawaii because of the migration of Humpback whales and every morning, whilst having breakfast, we watched the wales playing and breaching which was incredibly magical and spinner dolphins spinning out. I think the season was at the end, kind of finishes around end of April max.  We took a whale watch tour and took swim with the wild dolphins trip as well but realised if you do dolphin trip, you get to do both where as if you are watching the whale, you cant do the dolphins. My family swam with dolphins literally where the dolphins would be surrounding you and play. Amazing experience, very humbling to be so close to nature. However, it also attracted hundreds of jelly fishes, my kids actually said getting stung by jelly fishes was a privilege?  Kona offers so much sight seeing, a care hire is definate must. Unfortunately, my son was ill for a week so we did not get to the observatory, helicopter ride to see the volcano etc.  Kona is an Island for lazing under the sun as well as hectic sight seeing.  Hualalai is the only hotel to stay that offers luxury and service on Kona Island and the children will be very happy there too. Its very normal to walk on the beach to bump into turtles or swim next to them as they just pop up. Also, Kings Pond is a managed and safe sea pond with resident eagle ray(u can feed it at 1 o'clock but have to sign up exactly at 10, limited spaces) and many more species of fishes where you and the children can snorkel. There are five pools and all very well kept and very clean. Restaurants, good selection but if you stay as longer than a week, the food does tend to get rather boring so it would be good if they changed the menu around a bit.  Did not experience the Spa unfortunately but looked good, the gym is very well equipped, three different air-conditioned rooms as well as separate pilates and yoga rooms with good classes running through out the day but good classes you have to pay.  The hotel manager is a Brit, Robert and was incredibly accomodating to my son who was not well and sent him huge amounts of presents to keep him occupied and the food/beverages manager Sebastian also was incredibly helpful and bent backwards to please.

There were tons of kids and families at the hotel so it would definitely be a place I would go back to with our son but the beauty of the property is that because of the adults only area there is a place to go to when you want to get away and enjoy some peace and serenity.

We used to love the quiet pool, the bar, the areas for adults - where we could relax and still know families can enjoy a vacation there too. However on this last visit, we felt this was no longer the case. There were children eerywhere, specifically at the quiet pool, somewhere we thought was a safehaven for a nice quiet day on vacation. Kids at the pool means no more quiet pool, and therefore we had no where to go escape. Everywhre we went - golf course, restaurants, beach, pools - there were kids.    The room was not clean, it was dusty, I found 2 bugs and there was hair in the shower. It just apperared as if the attention to detail was lacking.    Furthermore, while the food was very very good, the service was very, very slow. We found ourselves wating at restaurants for a while before we actually ate.    This trip felt like a vacation to Disney - the resort is SO family friendly now, that people like me, a mother of 2 grown children going on vacation with my husband, did not feel valued any longer.

Cabana staff mostly attentive - took a little time to flag one down at first, and then again when we wanted to order food. Activities - my two boys (ages 15 & 23) went on the snorkeling trip and were quite disappointed that the person in charge turned it into a whale watching trip instead. They only went to one location to snorkel and they didn't believe the snorkeling lasted nearly long enough. They loved the intro dive class though. However, in the description, it said they'd dive in a pool and have a shore dive. The instructor only took them diving in the salt water pool. They also liked the variety of activities available - although the teen room was ""designed for a five yr old"" (according to the 15 yr old boy). The spa was perfectly serene. I've never had a better massage! Beach Tree restaurant was enjoyable but our waiter was much more interested in hanging out with a neighboring table of women. Ulu grill has a fabulous breakfast - perfect spot to watch whales breaching off the coast. Dinner was also ok. Just wish the maids would have cleaned our room before late afternoon - seemed like we ran into them several times as we came back to shower. But its a huge property.

157264963,50,Second time (staying at this hotel) is a charm,"We've stayed at this hotel twice. The first was February 2012 and now again April 2013. The first time we liked our room so much (room 2803) that we asked for it a second time. The two best things about the room are (a) the patio leads out to a lawn and a beautiful pool while still providing frontal ocean view and (b) the shower has both indoor and outdoor areas - the outdoor area is lined in lava rock and green plants, the nicest shower I have ever been in, feels like you are taking a shower in a warm rain in the jungle. The hotel has 3 pools, one for 21 and over, one for families and one for kids. There's also a saltwater (very large) pool where you can snorkel and view 75+ species of fish. The staff is great, very discreet and professional. Everything went perfectly and I'm sure we'll be visiting here again. If I had one small complaint, at the Ulu restaurant breakfast buffet there were several times I had to wait for the staff to replenish various items (bacon dish, donuts, strawberries).

The food was delicious at each of the four restaurants and the service was extremely friendly. We were assisted by Gilles at the concierge who put together a magnificient 3 days of adventure which included outrigger canoeing, paddle boarding, snorkeling, sightseeing in a helicopter, swimming with dolfins and manta rays at night (this was extraodinary!) We also took advantage of the lovely spa services and relaxation by the pool. I can't say enough about the setting, food, service and amenities at the Hualalai Four Seasons Resort.

156954523,50,Amazing but overstretched,"I have stayed at this resort twice now, the first time on business and the second time with my family. There is no doubt that this is a very special place. There are many hotels and resorts that compare easily on the level of luxury and service but there is a magic here that I haven't seen anywhere before.    Some of that magic comes from the resort itself and the rest from the staff. The first few days of our stay overlapped with what must have been a very busy week for the resort. To be fair we were given advance notice that it was going to be busy and to book everything in advance. On arriving though I was surprised at how overstretched the staff were and of course with that went the magic.    We were early and knew our room wouldn't be ready until 3pm, we were made very welcome and offered a tour of the resort. Knowing my way around I passed on this and we checked out the beach and one of the pools for a few hours. What I didn't expect though was for 3pm to come and go and for our room not to be ready. After the staff at the pool kiosk where not able to find out what was going on it took a trip to reception to sort out.    The kids pool was a mess on the day we arrived, rubbish on the floor, cups floating in the pool and towels all over the floor. The beach was not much better and it was a real shame to see plastic buckets from the kids pool floating out to see. I managed to retrieve a stray plastic bag from doing the same. Disappointing given the effort the resort goes to in helping to protect the local marine life and in particular the turtles.    As I mentioned we were advised in advance to make dinner reservations. I made a couple as like most people I sometimes like to decide on the day where and what I would like to eat. Not a chance and the concierge were not able to make us any additional bookings. In passing I explained my issue to one of the pool staff who a couple of hours later had spoken directly with the restaurants and made us bookings at the times we wanted. Great news and some of the magic was back. How is it though one of the pool guys was able to sort this out vs the concierge?    Same thing with Scuba Diving, it was fully booked which fair enough I had expected this but instead of some useful suggestions on where else I may enjoy this activity nearby I was added to the wait list. I checked back in a couple of days later and after looking at the list a very surprised member of staff informed me that there was room and I shouldn't have been on the wait list.    Housekeeping was another challenge. With two young children I requested an early turn down service. On the first night we arrived back from dinner and had to phone twice until someone turned up. The second night only the once and for the rest of the week they arrived just as we were walking out for dinner which was perfect.    The staffs were stretched and this was easy to observe however as the resort emptied out the magic returned and we had an amazing stay here. We shall certainly be staying here again I shall just try and avoid the week before Easter if possible.    There are many reviews here which highlight all the great things at the resort so I won't mention them here. I would say though that this is the only luxury resort I know where they really do look after the kids, there is so much for them to do here. There was even an Easter Bunny and Easter egg hunt whilst we were here which the kids loved.",Apr 2013,March 2013,Traveled with family,,London
156930326,50,Pampered Paradise,"We have stayed in a regular room, a suite and rented a Villa. You can't go wrong staying anywhere on this property. They have activities for kids, adults ... adults who want some alone time :) and it's wonderful for families. They have great dining, a serene spa with outdoor massage huts, a wonderful general store and boutique shopping. I also love their workout facility and classes. We rarely leave the property to visit other places on Kona.    Make reservations for dining ahead as the Beach Tree gets especially busy.The resort has a unique beach by the kids pool with a bulkhead to make the water calmer and shallower in addition to the rest of the beaches. They offer additional water activities where the Kona resort used to be which is a walk down the beach...bring sandals as that part of the beach can be full of rocks and sharp sticks. It's a great beach walk even if you aren't going to the activity hut. There are lots of turtles to see and King's pond is a fabulous experience. They print a schedule when they feed the Eagle Rays.    A lesser known dining option that is wonderful is the Residen't Beach House. They do allow resort guests most of the time - just ask. It is a great spot for lunch or a late afternoon snack. It's much smaller than the other options so it can get busy but it is close to the beach and a favorite of homeowners there.    If you have kids over 5 or teenagers, they have a great kids club and planned activities. They have an ampitheater and also usually have a movie once a week. One of the most convenient parts of this resort that others don't offer is the laundry areas by each cluster of rooms. They are scattered throughout the resort and do not charge plus have everything you need. I have been grateful for these even when laundry is the farthest thing form my mind.    I never stayed at this resort with a baby or toddler but they have a sandy, shallow pool near the kids pool that is just their size. Since it is small, you may have to get up early to get a spot or ask if you can reserve one at a cost.

We went during spring break and it was pact, but what resort in Hawaii is not slammed during spring break. What sets Hualalai apart from other resorts is their staffs continual effort to do a perfect job. We often ordered things not on the menu poolside and the staff made it happen, The setting is very family oriented more so than any resort that I have stayed at. I can see why this was the peoples choice award. Anyone that would complain about this resort needs a reality check on life. It does not get any better. Both Maui and Lanai are great, but the service that you receive at Hualalai sets it apart from both. Maui is a little to uptight and not as kid friendly, and Lanai is real kid friendly but the pool and food are not as good. The only ding on Hualalai is their beach, but their pools and the kings pond make up for it. I asked my wife why do we continue to go back to Lanai and Maui and she said I don't why.

This is a two bedroom and two bath ground level unit with a beautiful porch overlooking the golf course. This is not an inexpensive place to stay, though with a family of four the rental was cheaper than staying in the ""resort"" rooms. The place is gorgeous with most every amenity... marble counters... huge soaking tub and showers both indoors and out... internet access, cable TV, gas grill, golf cart to get around the resort property. We rented through realtor Aubrey Estrada of Big Island Premiere Properties and she was great, as was her staff who quickly realized that we had left our passports behind and had someone track us down poolside to return them to us before we had left for the airport!    For an additional fee (I think it was $50 per day for everyone over 15) we had access to the full resort amenities... which was really indulgent. This meant poolside chairs and cabanas where impeccably cheery staff provide ice water, bring around the occasional snack... and then it gets really silly with someone who comes around to clean your sunglasses and even a guy who sprays Evian mist on you if you are too hot but don't feel like walking the 8 feet to the pool! Really!    There at least 4 pools on the property, though our youngest loved the ""King's Pool"" which is a saltwater pool filled with tropical fish and even an eagle ray. It is a great way to learn to snorkel (equipment available at the pool at no cost). This is great because you can also take the snorkel stuff across the walk to the ocean where there is a sort of protected cove with more fish and occasionally sea turtles.    There are tide pools in the seaside lava rocks and these proved entertaining for us too, seeking out sea life and watching how the pools change with the tides.    Our teen loved the gym, which has most anything you could want. There are lots of activities and classes and things to do (most at some additional cost)... our boys went on a snorkel scooter adventure (okay, we lied and told them the 11 year old was 12 or else he wouldn't be able to go) where they get into wetsuits and snorkel gear and have these battery operated propeller things that basically make them motorized snorkelers... they loved it, very James Bond.    There was a ton of things we could have done at this resort, golf, tennis, kayak, stand up paddle and lots more... but we were so happy sitting at the pools!    Food at the resort restaurants was basically good but outrageously expensive! We cooked dinner at least once and had breakfast at the condo... winning meals at Kenichi Pacific, Sam Choy's Kai Lanai... activities included Akaka Falls, Hawaii Botanical gardens, Poke-A-Stick lava tour and we rented a boat at Kona Boat Rentals.",Apr 2013,March 2013,Traveled with family,The upper floor golf villas have vaulted ceilings and better ocean views... but the ground level...,"Bloomington, Indiana"

Some guests were out putting towls on chairs at 7:00 am.    While I loved the resort, I cannot recommend it. The hotel is amazing at the unexpected treats and beauty, but is not delivering on the basics. I would recommend Mauna Lani instead.

156217822,50,Heaven on Earth!,"I have been to Hawaii every year for the last 25 years...sometimes 2 or 3 times in a year. We used to island hop and try out different hotels until we found the Four Seasons Hualalai. It is located on the Big Island, which is not a very pretty island (you will be disappointed to see nothing but lava rock on the drive in from the airport) but the resort is the very best I have ever stayed in. The reason I prefer the Big Island to the other, greener islands, is because the climate stays consistent and there is little rainfall (on the Kona side of the island). Maui and Kauai are BY FAR the more beautiful islands, but they tend to rain a few hours almost every day to stay that green and lush. The good thing about the resorts on the Big Island is that you would never be able to tell you are on an island surrounded by lava rock. All of the hotels on this island do an excellent job of landscaping so you feel like you are in a tropical paradise.    The Four Seasons Hualalai is my absolute favorite because the rooms are gorgeous, the staff is friendly and quickly learns your name, the food is amazing, and the spa is world class. I've been to some of the best resorts in the world and this one takes the cake. I really like that it is bungalow style and not a high-rise hotel.    Tip for the older travelers: There is a lot of walking at this hotel because everything is so spaciously layed out (which I love, but it is difficult when my parents join me). You can call the front desk and they can pick you up at your bungalow in golf carts to take you to the restaurants, golf club, or spa.    There is no bad time of year to travel to the Hualalai.

They have three restaurants to choose from, Ulu which has an asian flair, Beach Tree Restaurant which is more Italian and continental and their Hualalai Grill.which is excellent steaks, lamb chops and the like. That was my absolute favorite.  The pool looks right over the ocean, while the spa and gym provided a relaxing respite. I am glad that my pedicure/manicure was also paid for since it was $140 if not! And, they don't have nail dryers! Have to say on that count, my $35 combo at home was better!..But, it was relaxing.  I think what stands out about this Four Seasons compared to one we went to in Jackson Hole, Wyoming is how accomodating the whole staff was. There was never a question of ""NO'. When you got to pool, someone was there immediately offering your towels and providing you with glass of water..which was constantly filled. Same on the beach lounges. I called one day to find out when they were making up room so could shower, and they said, let us have you next on the list.  There are many paid activities the concierge can suggest like ziplining or watching dolphins, or horseback riding or waterfall trips. I'm not much for that kind of adventure, so the only reason I gave this a 4 instead of a 5..is that, unlike going to the Caribbean.i.e. St. Martin where we usually travel from New York, you'd have to rent a car and travel a good 2-3 hours to see the plus side of the island or volcanos.

155146891,50,A resort above all resorts,"This is my favorite resort hotel. As soon you as drive up, you are greeted by the friendly bellman and walk in for a personal check-in experience, you know you are in for a treat.  This resort has five 'crescents' which are five different (all wonderful) environments the rooms are grouped around. Whether you stay in my favorite, King's Pond, or one of the others that include the Family Pool, Beach Tree Pool, Adult Pool, or Golf View areas, you won't be disappointed. In fact, you can stay in a different crescent each time you stay at this resort and feel like you've had a slightly different experience. The only suggestion I have, other than to suggest you find your own favorite, is if golf doesn't float your boat, the other four crescents probably have better views.  The rooms in the two-story bungalow style buildings are all wonderfully appointed and other than suites, the only difference is whether you have an outside lava rock garden shower which is only available on the lower level. The spacious indoor part of the bathrooms in the upper level are just as nice, just missing this additional feature.  The restaurants are excellent and offer you a choice. The Beach Tree restaurant is where you'll can enjoy lunch or dinner and is probably the most casual. ULU Ocean Grill offers breakfast and dinner, and has wonderful views. The newest restaurant is Hualalai Grill, a steakhouse above the golf pro shop. There is also a great beach bar at one end of the property that is not technically part of the hotel but you can sign charges to your room while you take in sunset.  Golf is a highlight here where the ocean almost laps up to the green or tee box on some of the holes. Tennis is available along with a great indoor/outdoor workout area. And as you would expect at a Four Seasons, the spa is exceptional.  Service is warm and friendly. You will be greeted, often by name, by every resort staff member whether in the lobby or passing a gardener as you walk around the lovely grounds.  Finally, the location is probably the best on the Kohala Coast since the beach is wonderful and it is one of the closest to the airport (about 15 minutes). But don't worry, air traffic is non-existent and the only thing you'll see in the sky is a beautiful sunset every evening. Watch for the Green Flash!  All of this luxury does not come cheap, with this hotel enjoying some of the highest occupancy of all hotels in the Four Seasons collection as well as among all Hawaiian hotels.

There are a lot of wonderful things to say about most of the service team, but unfortunately we had some rude waitstaff too. Pool attendants who seemed bored to help you, waitress who walk away while you are talking and flat out snarky comments. The Beach Tree restaurant is supposed to be free for children under 4. We received our bill with their meals charged, and when I pointed this out kindly to the waitress she told me that she had to charge us, because people come in who aren't guests and try to eat for free. She could have simply asked our room number and last name, but instead she argued her policy, said she didn't work there recently to know us. I had to get someone else to adjust the bill, and the original waitress came back and said, ""I am sorry if you are offended."" While checking out, I asked for an extra 15-30 after our check out time, and the front desk guy said, no we can't do that for you, we told you that already, I suggest you hang up the phone and start packing. I would hope that a hotel of this caliber wouldn't have snafus like this, but they do. Also room service would come until 3 or 4, then turn down would come at 5:30. They all know when our dinner reservations are, so why would turn down come come 30 minutes before? I remember other top hotels, especially in Mexico, would always know your schedule and were seamless in and out of your room. The spa was amazing and the treatment was great. We had a couples massage and the web sites totes how fabulous the massage room is, deep soaking tub etc. Unfortunately the minute the massage was over the attendants told us we had to leave, that another couple was coming and needed the room.

We were lucky enough to get a great deal and got the lowest price room which at this resort doesn't matter since all of the rooms are great. =) We spent a lot of time pool lounging, either at the adult pool or at the quiet pool, and the attendant service was terrific. The staff at the Cultural Center is amazing and genuine. We used the tennis courts once and the court and equipment was stellar. If I had to find a fault anywhere at the resort, it would be with the food & beverage. Food and bev is pretty meh and at the prices they charge this is where they should improve. However, you will not find a better resort anywhere IMO and even though it's expensive you truly do get your monies worth overall.",Mar 2013,September 2012,Traveled as a couple,Golf View rooms are quiet and seem more private.,"Austin, Texas"
154616132,50,The Time of Our Life,"We just got home tonight from our fantastic trip to this outstanding home away from home. We stayed in an oceanfront room, #801, and it was great. We overlooked Kings Pond and the ocean and located next to Ulu. The room was quiet, even though I slept with the windows open most nights to hear the waves crashing. We also had an outdoor shower! Nice. We ate at Ulu many times and the food was top notch as was the service. We loved Nastassia at Ulu. Great service, great suggestions. The Pear Saketini is a lovely cocktail. The Hamachi with jalapeno is great as is the Kampachi, the mussels (yummy curry sauce) and the Crab potstickers. And, this fish oriented restaurant served us up an amazing Kona crusted New York steak. Yum!! The Beach Tree Restaurant and Bar was also great. This is the place to watch the sunset and the whales breaching. Seriously, save the money on the boat trip and just watch them from the lounge while enjoying a delicious beverage and their amazing Local boar nachos. So good. Steve , the bartender here was great. My husband loved the golf here as well. On his second round, he walked into a tree and cut his eye up pretty bad. Carl, from security took great care of him. Cleaned his eye up and gave us some first aid supplies to hold us over. Carl is security, and all their security people are EMT's. I could write a novel about this place. From valet, to reception, to room service to housekeeping. Oh, the massages at the spa were amazing. This IS the kind of place you never have to leave. The thing is, we do like to check out other stuff and this location is not near anything. Its going to be a twenty minute drive at least. That is not a negative, just a fact.

After our concierge asked if we wanted to pre-book any activities, I responded that we were going to play it by ear and our main goal was to relax and have no commitments. We were pretty much left alone after that, which made me feel a bit abandoned. You could fill your days with plenty of things to do and feel like you have conquered the island or, feel like the Swiss Family Robinson, secluded and isolated but with a side of Ice-cream cookies after a Mahi-Mahi Ceviche. We chose the latter. And then realized we couldn't do it. We wanted it all.  The Suite was pretty spectacular, directly across the ocean and the quiet adult pool and gardens, it boasts a very large ground floor Lanai with sun beds and outdoor dining furniture and a lounging couch (perfect for an afternoon nap). A tremendous living room with a full dining room and living room with full bath, steam room included. Beautifully appointed bedroom with Lanai and bath with three showers, one is a lava rock exterior orchid garden, a separate interior shower and a large bath tub with shower. that brings the count to four showers.  The breakfast Big Island buffet at the 'Ulu Ocean Grill is very good, not perfect but very good. The Smoked salmon did not seem fresh, dry corners. The fruit Juices settled and separated and were not cold, while it is a buffet it should still have attendants on hand to keep it up to par other than the omelette cook and refills. But it was very good, choose a beach side table and feel heavenly.  The Beach is sandy and long, plenty of sun beds available, unless you want the secluded areas, there is no need to reserve. Don't miss the treats every hour. If you are too far they wont reach you. You might see whales, dolphins, turtles. Not ideal for swimming but you can.  The pools are very different from each other, we loved the black stone adult pool with bar.  The Spa is excellent, the fitness facility is spectacular, it has its own big lap pool and great retreat feel.  Dinner under the stars is unforgettable.  The service is outstanding yet at the same time feels that you sometimes have to ask to get it, can't they read my mind?Just kidding.  No really, I might not agree it is the #1 Resort in the world just yet but it is an extraordinary place. I don't think that the asian luxury service level can be achieved in our beautiful USA without it costing unrealistic prices. This is a well balanced mix of seclusion and "" there if you need us"" type service, I am someone that hates to ask but expects to be looked after and at the Four Seasons Hualalai at Historic Ka'upulehu we enjoyed the property immensely, as if we were at our own beach home. I am sure that it gets better with future visits as they get to know you and your needs.  Bottom line tell your concierge your expectations and let the magic take over.

People were super friendly and service was impeccable. The concierge was also extremely helpful before we arrived recommending activities and making restaurant reservations. My only major complaint was our room. It was an ocean front (800 wing) with a beautiful ocean view overlooking kings pond . When I first saw room though, I was a little bit concerned that it was close to a maintenance area (laundry, ice maker, etc). But it was the back of the room that was close to this area so I let it go. My first instinct was correct though since we woke up every night (1 am, 3 am, etc) to the sounds of the hotel staff working in this area. This night shift was a constant source of noise- carts being pushed, doors slammed, etc (also its the back of the ULU restaurant) which was unfortunate especially since this is one of the more expensive rooms. We finally complained after a few nights and the manager was extremely apologetic and offered to comp us should we ever come back to the resort. We appreciated this, however its hard to believe that no one else has complained about this and they allow this type of disturbance to happen in the middle of the night at an otherwise impeccable resort.",Mar 2013,February 2013,Traveled with family,"Beware of rooms backing up to hotel ""maintenance"" area","Seattle, Washington"

It is expensive but worth it. We had prime oceanview (room # in 3000's) which was spacious, had refrigerator and coffeemaker, did have nice view of ocean (heard waves) but wasn't noisy even though it looked out on a pool. Nearby washer/dryer was much appreciated. Can understand why people come here and never leave the premises during their stay. One can walk the beach over to the old Kona Village Resort (where you can rent paddleboards etc), nice snorkeling there. Kona Village reconstruction is just starting. You can walk opposite direction past Kukio (nice snorkeling there and great keiki tidepool) and over lava to Kua Bay (nice snorkeling and waves there but crowded on weekends). Lots of cultural activities and keiki stuff. Had two very good meals at Ulu Grill, much better than when we ate there at Christmas. For those who haven't snorkeled, the Four Seasons has the King's Pond which is stocked with lots of fish, but it is colder water than the ocean.

Our room smelled like a dirty aquarium. Not overwhelming and could have been tolerated, but not for >$1k per night. The resort was quick to respond and accommodated our request (fortunately an alternate was available). The second room was in the middle of resort with an ocean view and was more of what we expected (same floor plan). Another knock on King's Pond is that the crescent closes and locks at 4pm, at which point some units lose direct access to the beach and have to walk around the back. We found that rather odd.

153275766,40,Fabulous resort but frequent vog makes for iffy air,"My title says it all, but as an approximate ten-time visitor to the Kohala Coast of the Big Island I would like to point out that the area around Kona is frequently plagued by vog (bad air from the volcanos similar to smog from cars). The winds and air currents carry this bad air well north of Kona, often to about a spot called the scenic point, still north of Hualali. This can significantly impact, negatively, a visit or stay to this area. Resorts further north (the Waikaloa area, the Mauna Lani area and the Mauna Kea area) rarely have this problem. I have heard about folks who have moved from their multi-million dollar Hualali homes because of the bad air. Since the periods of vog are unpredictable, this adds a risk factor to a stay there worth considering. The volcanos vary in their activity but have been active of late. Of course, it is hard to find travel promoters mentioning this issue. As I also said in the title, however, the resort is fantastic when the air is good.",Feb 2013,February 2013,Traveled as a couple,The silver lining to vog is often more interesting activity in Volcanos Park.,CT
153138528,50,Best resort in the world?,"I spent a LOT of time researching this hotel and talked to a lot of people that said it was one of the best resorts in the world. So my expectations were quite high. I can safely say that after spending 5 nights there that all my expectations were exceeded. This IS the best resort in the world, or at least any of the ones I have been to.    The location is amazing. We spend out days lounging on the beach (with full service of course) watching the whales jump and the turtles crawl up on shore in front of us. When we got hot a quick dip in one of many pools cooled us down. Thirsty? Walk on over to the adult pool and grab a signature ""Corey Mai Tai"". Amazing!    The poolside food service was excellent. The pizza and fish tacos stand out, as do the onion rings.    Restaurants were equally as good. The only let down was the sushi at ULU which I thought was just OK.    Prices were not that expensive. Yes $20 for fish tacos but the service and quality of the food was on par with any place I have ever been.    The ""Farm to Table"" dinner was also very good. We enjoyed meeting new folks and talking with the chef.    The truly amazing thing was we were there during ""ski week"" which essentially filled the place. But yet, I never ONCE felt like it was crowded or waited in line for more than 15 seconds for anything. Amazing.    Golf was stunning. $250 gets you a FULL day rate and we played 26 holes in under 7 hours. Could have easily played another 18. Amazing views from the course and the last 3 holes are stunning water holes.    So much to do here. You could easily stay 8-10 days and never leave the resort.    I should also note while this resort is VERY family friendly, we went as couples and never felt overwhelmed. There is a great adult only pool that is 21+ and plenty of areas to get away from everyone else.

153005759,50,The VERY definition of Aloha,"I had very high expectations of this place - especially in light of a disastrous experience at a FS resort in another part of the world - but you can count me as another satisfied guest who can verify the glorious reviews of this place. EVERYTHING is done with perfection. Rooms: had a mid-category ocean view, ground level with outdoor shower. Extremely comfortable and excellently maintained. Never used the inside shower a single time in 8 days! Housekeeping was terrific. Laundry: everything came back beautifully done. There are also free, self-service washers and dryers (with free detergent) scattered around the resort for guests' use. Pools: heavenly; service wonderful. Spa: one of the best in the world, complete with every amenity you could want - and most importantly to me, a serene lap pool. Grounds: immaculate and impeccable. The sunsets are nothing short of jaw-dropping. It's a treat for the body, mind, and spirit just to walk around the property - day and night - just to take it all in. Vibe: casual and divine! We changed out of our khakis when we first arrived, and never wore anything but shorts and comfortable short-sleeved shirts for the entire stay (and we utilized every venue on property). Leave those dressy clothes at home and relax! Food: yum! I did not have one meal that was short of outstanding. Alcohol: varied choices and, for the most part, appropriately priced. For example, at Beachtree they have a pretty comprehensive list of wines grouped by price: $40, $60, and I think $80 a bottle. We chose from the $40 list every night we ate there - and were completely satisfied. I honestly don't know where else in the world - at a resort of this quality in equally gorgeous surroundings - you could enjoy a bottle of wine, beachfront, with great service for $40. No way! The new chef and his team at Beachtree are also worthy of special mention. Some seriously amazing, casually sophisticated food. Perfect menu, perfect offerings. Suggestion: do visit the Residents bar and restaurant - at the far tip of the resort (to the left if you are facing the water). Less crowded, particularly at sunset time. The food is great and the bar staff just as engaging as those at the hotel's outlets. And you get to chat with some very interesting people who are owners of the villas and condos at the resort. Finally, a word about the oftentimes debated price point at Hualalai. Yes, the B&B rate is not cheap. But for the price paid, I feel that I totally got my money's worth and did not feel taken advantage of at all. This is one of those destination resorts where the old adage ""you get what you pay for"" really rings true. Get the breakfast buffet in your rate, eat later in the morning (around 10-10:30sh), and enjoy a lavish selection of food that will keep you satisfied until sunset time. If 10:00am is too late to wait to eat breakfast - no worries, there is complimentary coffee and tea every day at the entrance to ULU. Just stop by on your morning walk or before your workout to get your caffeine fix until you eat a little later on. Later on in the day around 5:00-5:30ish (just as your full stomach from breakfast begins to get peckish), you can enjoy drinks ($8 microbrews, reasonably priced wine as I mentioned about etc.) with some complimentary and tasty cocktail snacks. Then, get ready for a mouth watering dinner with starters mostly in the $8-15 range and mains mostly in the $18-25 range. They also had some great and interesting fixed-price tasting menus - for example, a delicious one at ULU for $65 for 5 courses. It was scrumptious - and I've paid more than triple or quadruple that amount for similar food in boring, five-star city hotel restaurants with no view. Finally, I would be remiss if I did not give the Director of Rooms, Adam, a shout out for his gracious hospitality. Thank you, sir. My sincere congratulations to all of the team at the FS Hualalai for creating a resort experience that *IS* the very definition of Aloha, and tuly second to none. I get goosebumps just thinking about our incredible week there. Mahalo, and I do hope to visit again soon!",Feb 2013,February 2013,Traveled as a couple,,"Haverford, Pennsylvania"

Attentive staff, gorgeous location, delicious food, wonderful service, and even the weather cooperated! Every day was the ""best"" day, and we were completely thrilled with everything! Our oceanfront room was adjacent to the King's Pond, so we were surrounded by ocean view as well as the seclusion of the ""quieter"" end of the resort. Ahhhhhhhh, luxury!!!    If you're going, be sure to walk down the beach towards the currently-closed-for-renovations Kona Village Resort. The beach there is MUCH better than the one in front of the Four Seasons, and Four Seasons staff are onsite at the beach to handle snorkle gear, kayaks, etc. There were all of SIX of us on the entire beach one day last week ... four of us another day.

152726437,50,Four Seasons never ceases to amaze.,"Having stayed at several Four Seasons resorts before, I had high expectations. This resort lived up to the expectation! The service was top-notch, the food outstanding, golf was good, and the facilities were pristine. The fitness center had more machines and free weights than I have ever seen at a hotel. The King's Pond is an amazing place to snorkel with thousands of fish of all sizes and an Eagle ray! We loved seeing the turtles come lay up on the shore every afternoon to sun themselves.    Although we were not traveling with children, I couldn't help but notice all of the things they had geared for kids: a special kid pool with a beach and mini beach chairs, a supply of pull-ups at the cabana, a step stool in front of the sink at the pool bathrooms, cultural programs at the cultural center, etc.    If I had one criticism it would be that the signage leaves something to be desired. When walking the path behind the rooms, there are several key turns that are not marked and others where the markers are so low and small, they are difficult to read. Especially at night.",Feb 2013,February 2013,Traveled with friends,The rooms around Kings Pond are quieter but are a bit of a hike to the pools and restaurants.,"Austin, Texas"
152644160,40,Expensive and worth (most) of it!,"We typically aren't Four Seasons guests. It's not because we wouldn't like to be....it's just that we have a hard time justifying the prices. However, this was a special vacation with special friends and we were going to splurge for a few days. From the time you set foot on the property, it's different than a lesser price hotel. Cool cloths, a cool drink and a lei when you step out of the car to check in. A quiet, calm front desk that feels open air with all the windows and greenery surrounding it. Efficient, respectful people helping you get to your room and get your bags in. They would unpack for you if you wish. Ice, a light snack and fresh water bottles when you reach your room. Wonderful linens, lots of pillows and sliding doors that open the entire width of the room to capture the view and the breeze. It's the little things you are paying for. But it's the little things you notice as well. At the pool they set up your towels (as many as you want) on luxurious chairs that are actually comfortable to linger in all day. Especially when they bring around a frozen chocolate or a popsicle every now and then. And sunscreen - just in case you need it. No fighting for umbrellas - every one gets one. Fresh ice water every hour or so. A manager's reception for guests one night that included wonderful drinks, fine wine and great food - complimentary. Not trying to sell a time share or flip a bowl of pretzels at you and call it good. There were glitches here and there, but they were quickly remedied without snarkiness or making excuses. As a matter of fact, you don't really notice how lovely the whole visit is until you look back on it and remember all of the details. This hotel was voted one of the top hotels in the world very recently. I can't say as I have a number of other top hotels to compare it to - but I do know that I would go back to this one. I was pampered without being fawned over; indulged without even knowing it and rocked into bliss by the atmosphere, the amenities and the professionalism of all staff that we encountered.

We spent only 4 days there, and I've recommended it to numerous people over the last several months. What ever you do, take time to walk the path along the beach in the evenings.

We have travelled extensively and stayed in some luxurious hotels, however this hotel is definitely the best we have stayed in! Upon our arrival, we were blown away by the grounds of the resort, it was simply immaculate! The pool, gardens and beaches were all spectacular and so well kept! The room itself had a gorgeous view, was unbelievably clean and the bed was huge and comfortable! The resort was aware that our young son was traveling with us and provided a complimentary welcome pack for him, including a toy seal which he just loved (and still does)! An added bonus was a sealed nappy bin which was fantastic (those who travel with young children will understand just how good this is)! Another thing that sets this hotel apart from others was the staff! My husband and I were so very impressed the way all staff members from concierge to housekeeping to grounds keepers always said Aloha and made us feel so welcome! They were so friendly and no request was too big! The only disappointment we experienced was at the the Beach Tree Bar and Lounge where we had lunch twice, and both times there were problems. The first was a completely incorrect bill at the end of the lunch which took far to long to rectify and the second was when my young son's meal was forgotten! The food itself was fine, but the service was disappointing. This was completely the opposite at breakfast where the staff went above and beyond to provide an enjoyable experience!

She met super nice kids and immediately had a close knit group of play mates for the whole time. Since we know the island so well, we choose to always stay put on the property with Kukio next door providing an interesting beach break for surfing from the Four Seasons reef monster. Can't wait to see what Michael Dell and his friends do with the next door neighbor property, another stunning setting.

152075910,50,Deserves the ## ONE resort in the World award!!,"I'm not sure that I can adequately expand upon the previously posted comments !!! This is a magical resort! From the moment that you arrive at this beautiful property you are in an altered universe!!! The initial contact is beyond great!!! The attentiveness of every staff member is really incredible~they anticipate your every need and never make you feel that they are waiting for a tip! I could barely offer a tip to the young man that drove the cart & us to our room. He immediately reassured me that they all shared tip and that ALL would be taken care of! The service is perfection ~ all your needs are met quickly and efficiently The room views are beautiful ~ I really do not think that there could be a bad room in the resort.. Almost every room has the potential for some terrific view ~ there really does not seem to be any obstruction from the balconies~ all of the rooms that I observed faced the ocean ~ just the difference of a tree or a bush between the view!    We were so very happy with every aspect of our trip ! OUR trip was the first time that we have ever traveled together without any children/grandchildren We really missed them all and we had great memories in our hearts of our previous trips.    The food in the resort was wonderful ~ fresh ~ innovative ~ very appreciative of their willingness to go above and beyond to accommodate my husbands's gluten allergy. The bread was unique and fresh each meal! My husband usually had the bread and honey for dessert!! Room service was very very nice ! Plus, the food was hot and appealing ~ there was a toaster in the room and the server toasted the bread to your request. I can vouch for the fact that the food is definitely gluten free ~ my husband did not have any issues after our 12 day trip to Hawaii. That tells me that they take the allergy very seriously and that you can trust what they say is SAFE! The breakfast buffet is wonderful ~ love the food choice and SO SO wish that I had gotten the names of the staff ~ particularly of the Chef at the omelet station ~ he was phenomenal ... such an asset to the resort. You can tell that he loves his job and the interaction with the hotel guests! The service at the buffet was perfection ~ at times like these I wish that I could recall name of each person ~~~ From the hostess desk forward all was very very well done. The fruit bar was so fresh and I loved the croissants! The quality of the food at every meal was fantastic!    The spa was so very nice....the amenities were all available (lotion/shampoo/conditioner/shaving cream & razors/mouthwash/hairspray/deodorant and very nice quality!) Loved the outdoor whirlpool and cold plunge#~~~I hate to do the cold plunge, but always DO IT in honor of my mother!!!! Loved the outside lounging area ~ great service and lovely ambience!! Loungers and waterfalls ... nice service of snacks while you relax    The pool service is impeccable! Water .... snacks ... drinks... glasses cleaning ... sun screen ... towels ...drinks, light meals .... We really enjoyed the last day of our trip in the cabana ~ so much nicer there than killing time in Kona! After checkout, our folio was left open and available for all charges!

151898767,50,Beautiful but Expensive,"If you are considering the Hualalai you probably already know that it is VERY expensive. We have stayed here as well as many other very fine properties in Hawaii and around the world. For our money, we don't think the Hualalai is worth it. Yes the property is beautiful, the restaurants are great and the Four Season's style service is impeccable. The thing is, there are a lot of beautiful resorts with beautiful beaches and great restaurants in Hawaii. Maybe not quite as spectacular as the Hualalai but close and a lot less expensive. The Orchid on the Big Island is very upscale, has some great restaraunts, a nice beach and pool area, etc. for a lot less money. The main thing I didn't love about the Hualalai was the room. We had a lower category room and it was far to the back of the property, barely ocean view, long walk down to the rest of the resort and really just not that beautiful. For $700.00 or more per night I am hoping for better than that (on Expedia right now this hotel was $1045 a night, almost three times the price of other options in the area). Maybe if you have a room in a better location it's a better experience but you will pay for it! The restaurants too are all very expensive and the vibe at the hotel is a little more formal than I like while on a beach vacation. The pools are very lovely and the beach is nice but rocky and we didn't really hang out there. We did enjoy the bar down by the beach and we loved the casual beach restaurant that you can't go to if you're not a guest or a member of their beach club. The bottom line for me is if we found a deal and really wanted to treat ourselves we would go to one of the other hotels on the island for a few days then finish off with a few days here.",Feb 2013,March 2012,Traveled as a couple,,Southern california

The hotel may be big, but we don't feel crowded at all(may be a little bit during breakfast at the restaurants). The people are super friendly.

Some of our vacations have been at the Four Seasons abroad as well as the continental U.S. However, nothing you read here or on other reviews will prepare you for the experience of staying at this property. It is the ultimate vacation destination if a tropical setting is your choice of venue. We really love spending time together and we always enjoy our trips away, however, this resort is just stupefying. It's really a perfect experience. This is really a service based resort. Everyone goes far above expectations to ensure guests feel well taken care of during their stay.    The low rise accommodations blend perfectly with the grounds maintaining the feel of an island retreat. No tall buildings on the entire property. Our room was gorgeous and very comfortable and quiet. We had a suite by the lagoon with a view of the ocean. Sitting out on our deck was a feeling of utter contentment. We had smoothies and coffee for my husband and tea for me delivered to our room every morning on our deck before we went to our cycling class.    There are many Ironman triathletes who teach and participate in the classes. But all levels feel comfortable. That is the gift of Hawaii. Partway through class, ice cold towels are delivered to each person on their bikes. Following our cycling class we did a short workout in the gym and outside area. There are lots of choices to stay active if you like. This place makes it so easy to work out. Sometimes when we vacation, we forego working out, let alone daily workouts, but not here. There is this wonderful energy that is so motivating and the reward is pretty out of this World.    Once we were done, we were ready for the amazing breakfast buffet on the beach and a day relaxing or exploring the area. The food at all the restaurants is fantastic. Healthy options are available as well. Wonderful fruits, salads and fresh fish, sushi and also great substantial meat dishes as well. The outdoor restaurants on the water have beautiful views. The cocktails are traditional to innovative tropical concoctions. Service is impeccable from restaurant to the lounge chairs by the pool or on the beach.    We rented an private outdoor canopy bed by the adult pool one of the days we were there. We relaxed, had lunch, a decadent scalp and foot massage (we both fell asleep) read and took a swim in the pool. At the swim up bar, we met some a group of great people and enjoyed a small impromptu cocktail party in the pool. Other days the lounge chair areas in the shaded cabanas or in the sun all had great service, both drinks and food.    This is one of our top romantic trips.

We were a little concerned as there was a PGA tournament at the resort while we were there. Nothing to fear. The resort was quiet and peaceful. We didn't even know it was going on other than the fact that one of the restaurants was closed/reserved for our stay. The service was great. I am gluten intolerant. The menu had many gluten free options and they would modify the dish to accomodate me. They had gluten free bread, scones, buns etc. They even made me a special gluten free happy anniversary dessert.

150947649,50,Five stars but not quite Wailea FS,"Great hotel, gorgeous property and individual casitas (hawaiian name for them is...) and picture perfect pools with FS service though cabanas face the pool I prefer they face the ocean like FS Wailea. But there is literally no beach, and the Big Island has amazing beaches like at the Mauna Kea. OK that aside, the restaurant, I have my issues. The waiter graciously pushed a fish special. He kind of over pushed it. Two of us got it and then we understood why. The fish was probably not fresh, not rotten but certainly not fresh, rubbery and overly salted. They were clearly trying to get rid of inventory in my opinion, (I worked in restaurants in college and this was common). There is no lobby so forget about getting on your couture and showing off, not like FS Wailea which is a bit of a fashion show with movie stars sprinkled about its glorious lobby. This location is for people whom like golf, and want to hide away in their rooms, and have a more primative experience, ( I know that doesn't jive with a FS) as Kona is definately less commercial than Wailea. But for others it'll be too quiet. I think the best thing is a 2-3-4 approach. Two nights in Waikiki to pick up some energy and they have Allan Wong's restaurant the best in the state, three nights at Kona FS to neutralize Waikiki, then finish with four nights at FS Wailea to get the best of both and park yourself in an ocean view cabana and send gloating pics to your buds.",Jan 2013,January 2013,Traveled with friends,,"Los Angeles, California"
150876480,50,"Extremely pricey, but extremely excellent","I don't know if I can stay at a ""normal"" hotel again after experiencing the Four Seasons. Service and quality were truly exceptional. We stayed here two nights for our honeymoon, and it was such a perfect way to spend it. If you book through a preferred travel agent (you can find them via travel blogs of sorts), you can get additional perks like free brunch (REALLY GOOD) and meal credit at their fancy restaurant. Although their brunch is almost the same as that of the Mauna Kea Lodge Hotel a bit further up the coast, though Mauna Kea is overall ""more affordable"". I'm not normally one to want to stay on the resort grounds during a vacation, but that's all I wanted to do while at the Four Seasons. I was also surprised at how kid-friendly the hotel was, but they also have adult-only areas. Not that it was a problem to have kids around, since you rarely ever feel like the resort or its grounds are crowded. We also got a Lava Flow drink in the adult-only pool, which cost something like $16, but it was so worth it. So delicious. The waves were too strong for us to snorkel away from the shore (January), but they have the ""King's Pond"" which is an enclosed pool that has 4,000 fish apparently. They also offer various activities throughout the day, so sign up for those. There's staff manning every section of the resort, so you always have someone who offers you water or service -- very well-organized and a tightly run business.

150419545,50,"Incredible service, gorgeous coastline","All previous reviews speak about the beautiful, expansive grounds, the 5 varied pools and the impeccable service. And it is all true. But I have to stress that the coastline and surf were for me what will take me back there. FS is situated on some of the most beautiful, gently rigged beach I have ever experienced. It isn't a white sand beach; it is low groupings of lava rock that form tide pools and natural swimming areas. I swam with fish and green sea turtles right on the beach! The water is warm enough to snorkel in for 40 mins+ without getting cold.    Definitely treat yourself to ocean activities. All the guides at Alaka’i Nalu (the ocean activities center on premises) are wonderful with great attitudes, warm smiles and a wealth of knowledge about the water and the area. Mark spoke with us about the history of the island and the region at length and really sparked a deeper appreciation of the area for us, and he wasn't even our guide that day! It's information interaction that make this place not just a luxurious vacation getaway but a really special place.    And of course who can ignore the food! Yes, it's very expensive. We had never been to a FS property before so we were unprepared for the cost of food and drinks (e.g. $25 for a turkey club sandwich) but it was so gosh darn good! The food quality level was consistently very high. And if it's not on the menu, well, they will probably make it for you. One night we were at the Beach Tree lounge and didn't want to leave, we were so comfortable and having so much fun, but really wanted sushi, which is not on the Beach Tree menu. So the manager walked over to the Ulu, the seafood and sushi restaurant, and walked it back over to me. What a doll! I wish I could remember the name of our server that night too. All staff are wonderful but she was particularly great.    There are so many many details I could gush over but I will leave at, it is a place that pampers and coddles you while offering intimate encounter with gently rugged beauties of the natural world.",Jan 2013,January 2013,Traveled as a couple,"We had the northern most ocean front room, where the paved promenade ends, which is a turtle...","Los Angeles, California"

We never got it. Instead we got the most unwelcoming room they have. It is extremely dark and the first thing you see as you walk inside it is a bare wall!  We were really shocked! How is it possible that a place such as the 4 Season at Hualalai could have a room like this? It doesn't take that much to put a Hawaiian inspired media cabinet and some nice art work on the wall..... If I had my way I would have changed the position of the beds, and yes we never got our request... We got 2 tiny beds!  The bathroom is ok and there is the outdoor shower, but that is it pretty much. The room number is 2202. So if you go there make sure you don't stay in it. We go to hawaii at least once a year and based on this room we will not come back at this 4 season.

149882699,50,Ten years later... Still one of the best hotels in the world,"We returned to Hualalai for the first time in 10 years. We loved the resort when we visited 10 years ago and were wondering if the property would still be as lovely as we remembered. We like to visit new places and try new things on holidays, but decided to return to the Four Seasons after a decade because we had such fond memories.    Had we built up unrealistic expectations? Had we remebered it better than it was? We were not disappointed. The service was excellent as one would expect at any Four Seasons (special thanks to Kurt and the beach crew, the great staff at the Kings Pool and and the great staff at Ulu). The pools, tennis, restaurants and coffee shop were great.    The low density aesthetic of the resort remains timeless. The facilities were spectacular and have been maintained to a first class standard...Nothing old about this property. The continued capital expediture on the property is evident.    We rented a house on the grounds so we didn't stay in the actual hotel (this worked out better for us as we have three kids and it would have required two rooms). The resort facilities were as spectacular as we remebered. Golf was amazing. Ulu is a new restaurant (opened in the Fall of 2012) which we really enjoyed.    We arrived on Jan 2 and stayed until Jan 12 so we avoided the Christmas rush. Everyone told us that the hotel was very busy during the Christmas period and there was a scramble to get chairs by the pool, book tennis courts and get dinner reservations. Luckily we missed all this. Apparently it is very busy at Easter as well - perhaps avoid these times.    We travel a fair bit and Hualalai remains one of our favorite places in the world.

149880375,50,Amazing stay! Can't wait to return!,"This was the third and final island visit and hotel stay on our honeymoon in September of 2012. It was by far our favorite stay out of the three we visited [Four Seasons Maui & Lana'i prior].    From check in to check out, our stay was flawless and relaxing. The drive in from the airport alone was exciting! We had never been to the Big Island and it is so different from Maui and Lana'i. The landscape is a complete contrast; with black lava rock as the main focus as opposed to lush green valleys. But don't be fooled; the coastline and resort setting is so lush and beautiful; flowers, trees everywhere.    At check in, we were greeted by a young gentlemen who gave us bead necklaces and a refreshing beverage while we sat on a couch and went over our stay.    We were then taken in a golf cart by a very nice man whose name I cannot remember. The rooms are a neat set up; they are two stories - the top story has a nice balcony and view. The bottom floor has an outdoor shower and lanai. I would probably recommend the top floor as the outdoor showers don't appear to be all that great to compromise a beautiful view. We were on the top floor overlooking Kings Pond. The rooms are awesome - they are decorated with dark woods and while still feeling Hawaiian, it is not cheesy or over-done. Bathrooms are spacious with separate tub and glass walled shower. As at all Four Seasons, plenty of amenities in the bathroom [large size L'Occitane products]. They think of everything.    The resort has seven pools. Our favorite was the Beach Tree pool which was the large rectangular one overlooking the ocean with cabanas on either side and a wooden deck. We sat there everyday! Pool service was great - they set up towels, brought by treats, cleaned your glasses, provided sunscreen etc. We had a woman named Mary take care of us everyday and she was fabulous.    We did head over to the Palm Grove Pool which is the adults only pool with a swim up bar and infinity edge. It was fun but we liked the other pool more as it was a little too quiet at the Palm Grove Pool. We did snorkel a few times in Kings Pond as it was right outside our room. I am not a fan of snorkeling in the open ocean so this was the perfect alternative! The staff provided the snorkel gear free of charge.    My husband golfed twice and I rode along in the cart for the back nine. It is a really neat course. Lava rock is basically the hazard along with typical sandtraps, etc. Their signature hole [#17 I believe] has an amazing view of the ocean. I recommend playing this course [or at least riding along for the view!]    We did not do any excursions except for Waipio Valley [that's a whole other reivew -- wow, what a workout as we walked up and down the 'hill'] Concierge gave us great directions and it was a fun morning visit. If you're looking to get in some exercise this is the excursion for you!    Overall, food, drinks and service were five stars. We were able to book with a breakfast package so we had the full buffet every morning. It was delicious. I always know a buffet is good when their fruit selection includes entire bowls of raspberries, blackberries and strawberries and not just melons. lol  I loved our room, the pools, and the atmosphere at this hotel. I really do not have any complaints.    I would say there were only a few downsides to our stay but nothing to amend my rating from five stars: apparently one of the main restaurants was closed until November of 2012 for re-modeling. So we ate at the Beach Tree restaurant four nights in a row. We didn't mind though, because the food was excellent. Also, the beach at this hotel isn't much for swimming due to rock and coral so it's mostly pool swimming but we drove to a separate beach which was five minutes down the road with crystal clear water and that satisfied our ocean swimming for the stay.    Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel. I am already asking my husband when we can return! :) Wonderful, friendly service with enough luxury yet not overwhelming or over the top [like Maui].

149803748,50,Love it!,"My rating is based only on the amenities that we used - so no comment on the spa, water activities, etc.  Loved the outdoor shower that came with our ground-level room. It's my favorite part of our stay, even our whole vacation around the island. The Beach Tree pool has warmer water due to its darker tiles. The King's Pond has lots of fish and even an eagle ray so fish feeding time was quite interesting. You'll see the same or more fish than you'd see on a snorkeling trip to Captain Cook (south west of Big Island). The only thing is that because the water is brackish (fresh water and salt water combined), snorkeling can be a bit blurry.  Love the fact that you can see whales, dolphins and sea turtles just by standing/lounging on the shore. They are a daily occurrence at this time of the year.  Ukulele lessons were so much fun!!  Make sure to check sunset times so that you can book your dinner reservations accordingly. The sunset view from Ulu is great.  Ulu's kailua pork steamed buns with kimchi is so good. My husband was disappointed with his lobster because it had bread stuffing. The rest of the food from Ulu (breakfast and dinner) and Beach Tree were decent. Nothing spectacular. Pricey.

149381699,40,Back for seconds...,"June 2012 was our second time (November 2007 was the first) staying at this resort after spending the first part of our trip riding the monorail for countless hours and theorizing why the bathrooms were so small at the Hitlon Waikaloa Village property down the road. The Four Seasons is very civilized - tasteful/sizeable rooms, attentive staff, well manicured gardens, awesome golf course, cool pools, not too big, delicious (but expensive) food and an overall relaxing vibe. The beaches are decent on an island not know for beaches - remember, you're sitting on active volcanoes - and there's always a good number of green turtles around sunning themselves on the rocks. The place was flooded in parts by the sunami so they had to rennovate and rebuild buildings closest to the water - the only residual issue from this is that the Kona Village resort next door with the huts and nice little lagoon is fenced off so that limits the better ocean safe boating/floating options for younger kids. Big pluses to this place: GREAT attention to kids...we got so many gifts and special food items that my young sons thought they were in heaven; well appointed rooms with wonderful tubs and showers; pool service (food and other accoutrements); awesome golfcourse; Beachtree restaurant food. Negatives: room rates and food/drink costs are steep; cultural programs are offered on a limted basis (ukelele lessons should be offered more often!); spa services are ok, not great (service rooms are very nice).    Probably would've given it a 5 start rating if I hadn't been sick (island virus) while I was there (bad luck on me), the massage I got had been better, our rooms were serviced earlier int he day, and the wind had been a little more tame (we went fishing on a particularly windy day, paid big bucks for a charter and had to come in early with no partial refund - the hotel should've maybe advised on the weather or helped us recoup something from the captain). I'm nitpicking on things that were circumstancial, but every experience is colored by the context and these are things a remembered.

149268546,30,Property needs better maintenance.,"Beautiful surroundings. Very private. Don't go here to swim in the ocean or sit on the beach. The ad shot of the infinity pool lined up with the beach and ocean is misleading. The beach is six feet wide and all rocks. Our first room had cockroaches and bugs so they moved us to a big suite that was beautiful. The fridge didn't work properly and leaked, so they shut it off. We had to call maintenance seven times to come and fix the sliding glass doors to our balcony so the air conditioning would go on. Breakfast at $32 per person wasn't worth it. Unfortunately their steak house ( no ambiance) screwed up and our food wasn't very good. To mtheir credit, they did their best to rectify the situation, and comped the meal. A good meal would have been better.    The infinity pool didn't have stair entrances -- only ladders. The chair for people with handicaps to lower them into and remove them from the water was broken much of the time. I needed the chair but extracted myself in great pain up the ladder a few times. The staff said sorry. At anoither time, a man in a wheelchair with no movement in his legs lowered himself into the water, but the chair didn't work again -- so another guest and I lifted him out of the water as the staff watched. Minutes later, someone senior came rushing out, fawning apoligetically to the man in the wheelchair and offering dinner etc compliments of the hotel. I am glad they acknowledged him -- but they sure didn't care about my issues.    One of the pool attendants aggressively pursued a tip for placing four towels on two chairs for us . That was her prime skill.    Give us the Four Seasons Maui any day.

Yes, there are children but the resort is designed in such a way that it its very quiet away from the kids area.

148691886,50,In a class of its own,"This is obviously a top hotel, so I will say something about the culture there instead.    I usually don't pay much attention to reviews, but I can see why this is supposedly the best beach resort in the U.S. It is absolutely outstanding and - some of the reviews here none-withstanding - on a completely different level than FS Maui or indeed most hotels in the world. If you're just looking for a typical 5 star hotel experience, I wouldn't bother with this hotel because you probably won't appreciate just how nice and different this is.    It's important to understand that this resort is ""opinionated"", i.e. if you come here to expect your typical hotel experience, you will be disappointed. If you're looking to take an elevator up to your generic hotel room, enjoy some fake (but of course perfectly nice service) service from the staff, and you aren't used to asking for what you want, then this hotel won't work. This is important - just like other truly luxurious hotels, they maintain an excellent balance between overly intrusive and anticipatory service. If I'm on my vacation, I don't want someone coming by all the time asking me if ""I'm okay"". That's not service, that's just annoying, although many people will take that as ""service"". I want to be able to quickly glance in the direction of the pool attendants and have them come by right away. And this is where this hotel excels.    The other thing I love is just how genuine the staff feels. Unlike any other hotel I've stayed at, they provide non-obtrusive, friendly service that feels completely natural and warm.    Bottom line - This is not the FS Maui. It's not like most 5 star hotels. It's an amazingly relaxing tropical paradise with a perfect balance of service, amazing grounds and amazing architecture. Having stayed at lots of good hotels in the world, this is my favorite.    PS: Get the pancakes in the restaurant. They're like nothing I had ever tried before. Amazing.",Jan 2013,January 2013,Traveled as a couple,,"San Francisco, California"
148640721,50,"Incredible setting, some service missteps","We just spent two weeks split at four seasons maui and four seasons hualalai with 3 kids under 10. Both properties are incredible, but completely different. Maui is elegant, busy and near great shopping and dining. Hualalai is tropical, sprawling resort. Here is my opinion of the main areas:    Rooms - Maui has larger more elegant. Hualalai are very nice, but maui bathroom is huge!    Pools - the serenity pool at Maui is the best. Sea shell family pool at hualalai is good for families, but a little wild.    Dining - breakfast buffet at maui is better. More choices and better service. Pool menu at hualalai is more limited than Maui. Enjoyed dinners at both resorts quite a bit. Spago at Maui gives the edge to Maui.    Shopping - both resorts have great boutiques. Tie    Spa - hualalai wins. Bigger and more options.    Beach - Maui wins hands down. Softest sand I have ever felt. Hualalai really does not have usable beach.    Pool chair - both resorts are competitive for pool chairs especially during holidays. Hualalai was easier to get chairs, although the beds were not as comfortable as Maui.    Service - Maui wins hands down. Both are great, but Maui fs employees do not know the word NO. Maui employees are always around to provide any service and they use your surname. Best example is the following: one morning at Maui buffet our 3 year old did not eat. The server noticed and packed up eggs, bacin, bagels utensils for her to eat later. At hualalai the waiter would not even give us a plastic bag for her to take a bagel to go when she did not finish. My wife had to put a bagel in her purse.    Value - Everything at hualalai is more expensive than Maui, rooms, food activities. Better value in Maui.    So, in the end we will return to both, but probably would choose Maui first.",Jan 2013,January 2013,,,

148233921,50,Escape into Paradise,"My wife and I had a chance to spend the last four days of our vacation at the end of November 2012 in the FS at Hualalai. Staying at any Four Seasons has been by in large for us ""an experience"", not a vacation given their reputation, and in this case their reputation continued to be upheld.    The staff from start to finish was warm, courteous and professional. At the reception they had ready for us on a plate chilled pineapple with a cup of cold guava juice - phenomenal. About a half hour after checking in a staff representative brought us fresh Waimea punch in a sealed glass jar made up of pomegranate and pineapple juices - again phenomenal. The jar was reminiscent of growing up as it was the same that was used for making preserves from fruit trees in the back yard (cherry, strawberry, raspberry, blueberry, etc).    The Concierge planned the scuba diving, spa sessions and were spot on - walking into the spa, the employees already knew our names and were cordial. Their valet staff had unique insight to local stops (i.e. Lighthouse Delicatessen in Hawi as well as the farmers market in downtown). For those longing for a great NY style deli, the Lighthouse Delicatessen was a home-run...the owner was there making the sandwiches and you could tell he still had a NY edge on him despite living in Hawaii.

I told my husband, as a joke, that for my birthday I wanted to stay somewhere that is ""pure luxury.' Well, this wasn't a joke here! This place is just about as luxe as it gets. Everywhere you turn, it's like a photograph. While Hawaii is full of volcanic rock, the Four Seasons is incredibly lush and tropical. The grounds are manicured to perfection, truly! The attention to detail, everywhere on this property, is truly mind-blowing. From the time you check-in, and are served mai-tai punch out of little wooden bowls and a fresh piece of pineapple to the time you check-out, everything is divine. It was my birthday so when we came to our room, there was a piece of delicious chocolate cake waiting for me!    The pools are so gorgeous, especially the 'over 21' pool. The view from there is truly heaven with the palm trees framing the ocean. The 'quiet pool' is lovely and the 'family pool', while great for families, is also nice for couples too. The service and amenities at the pool are fabulous. We had many a delicious pina colada! When we had one that wasn't to our liking, they immediately sent it back and brought us a new one. In fact, the next day they found us at a *different* pool and brought us a pina colada on 'the house'! Hello? Where else do you get service like that???    We had an ocean view room which was lovely and had an amazing balcony and view. The bathrooms are fine- in tip top shape, but not uber-luxurious. This definitely wouldn't deter me from coming back...just makes me want to upgrade to a suite next time.    The restaurants, the Beach Tree and Ulu, have the most picturesque views of the ocean. In fact, everything here is done to maximize the ocean views. The food at both restaurants are 'fine', but truthfully, we had a stupendous meal at Manta at Mauna Kea. Although we're 'foodies' we still were quite happy at the restaurants at the resort.    The spa is really wonderful as well. The massages are in tents outside and then they have a 'zen'-type garden where you can relax after your treatment. There's a waterfall, lounge chairs, etc. You just feel like every detail is thought of here!

My husband and I were totally taken aback by how amazing the event sites turned out. Our wedding coordinator, Brittany, did an unbelievable job helping us put together and execute our vision. I remember my husband summarizing it as better than what we could have asked for. I cannot emphasize enough how amazing the entire wedding staff was - everyone from Shea to Brittany to Sara to Heidi were beyond helpful and very attentive to the last detail. It was a real pleasure to work with them and it made what could have been an extraordinarily stressful planning event a much more pleasant and exciting experience.

Prices are steep, but absolutely worth it. Nothing has been left to doubt in terms of attention to detail. If you haven’t thought of a way to make your stay more relaxing or comforting, rest assured that the FS has thought of it and there is someone there to execute that (this includes things like watering down the pavement so they aren’t hot to walk on!).

When we complained about the temperature of the lobster the wait person told us she was ""firing up a new lobster"" for my friend.

146150063,50,Perfection,"There is no reason to travel anywhere else for a vacation. We had very high expectations because of all the glowing reviews and the high standards of other FS properties. They were exceeded in almost every way. Fabulous staff. Gorgeous landscaping (it is so lush, you feel like you are in Bali, really), beautiful rooms, super comfortable beds and pillows. We traveled with our 17 mo old baby for 1 week and found that it was the perfect place to bring kids. But also, because of all the pools, we got to relax in the adults only area and enjoy no kids around. I think everyone can have a great time here. Spa was great as was the beachside spa services offered... foot massage while relaxing on the beach with a drink in a pineapple? Yes please!

146124036,50,Come here if you care nothing about the environment and the ocean habitat!!,"Well... Let's just say I have been a loyal patron of this property for over 15 years, even married here just 2 years ago, and love the property and it's beautiful grounds..... However the last 2 times I was here, both in September and November I have been shocked and disappointed in decisions the management made. In September we came to celebrate our second anniversary and at first all seemed to be in order... However during the stay and mind you, it's $780.00 per room per night for a starter room... We were confronted every day with the corporate function for In and Out Burger. I can imagine a lot of things and have many diverse groups of friends, but sitting in a 6 star resort with team leaders from In and Out was not exactly the demographic I expect at this level of resort. If they were just there, no problem, but they basically took over the place, the gardens with receptions and the entire pool area. They were very loud as they were in a group and I felt like a guest in a place that I actually paid for and got married at 2 years prior! I kind of chalked it up to bad luck and did not write anything, but tonight took the cake!! They were too full to take us because of another corporate event ( booked the entire resort) so we had to stay elsewhere, which I guess is my fault really... But, we went there for dinner to enjoy the newly renovated Ulu restaurant ( which is awesome) but.... While I dined and spent $520.00 for dinner for 4, I had to watch a couple, clearly tourists, line fish in protected waters right in front on the restaurant and hotel!! Now imagine, you spend a week in Hawaii, learn the culture ( which takes way more than a week to learn) do everything you can to respect that land, scuba dive and don't touch a single thing, take only photographs and leave only footprints... And then are expected to watch people that aren't even from the US killing tropical fish, without a permit, right next to a protected Green Turtle and the hotel does absolutely nothing about it????? These are protected waters, with protected habitat and endanger fish and animals and here come 2 dorky tourists with head lamps and spears and killing fish right out 10 feet from the main dining area of a 6 star resort! I think I can honestly say I was disgusted and sickened at the lack of concern, no security came, no one did anything!!! And when I threw a fit as a good citizen I was told that it was all fine! The reality is that the oceans all along the Hawaiian coast are considered Komehiana land and owned and protected by the Hawaiian people. I know this because I am honorary Komehiana myself! So therefore I was even more offended!!  Four Seasons, Wake up!!! This is not the experience I expect and your future guests expect!! We want to learn more about the wildlife and the culture in Hawaii and want to come enjoy and respect it! Not watch others destroying it!!! Get a life and a spine! Hire security and throw these people out! Get permission from the locals and throw them out! No one really needs to eat Tang fish and they are only killing them for sport as these people love to do! By the way the same mentality kill most of our whales too! Your company needs to stand for something or fall for everything and NOW is the time to stand! I will not come back there until you protect your reef and those perfect pools in front of your resort! It's all up to you!!  I will be watching!!",Nov 2012,November 2012,,,

We stayed for seven nights and delighted in most everything the resort offers. Only disappointment was what we call ""food rules"". Restaurants not open at all times which was a minor frustration for us. Dinner reservations a must if you plan to eat at the resort. We walked in to Ulu at 5:15 for dinner to be told the restaurant doesn't open until 5:30 and since we didn't have a reservation they were unable to accommodate us. Really? A party of two and you can't accommodate? We ended up sitting at the full service bar and had a great time with amazing views and a friendly bartender.

You truly do not need to go off property other than the HELICOPTER RIDE - the resort is really spread out and there is an incredible fitness facility (its HUGE!) lots of restaurants, pools, beach, snorkel center, etc. We stayed at 4Seasons Maui, as well as 4Seasons Hualalai on this trip.

145826253,50,Loved our time at the Four Seasons Hualalai,"To echo almost all of the other reviews on here about the Four Seasons Hualalai, we absolutely loved our stay at the resort. It is a beautiful property in a good location for exploring the island, or just relaxing by the pool. We stayed five nights and didn't want to leave.  Highlights for us included the awesome workout facility (with open-air rooms to enjoy the sunshine and ocean breeze), breakfasts at the coffee shop near the tennis courts, relaxing at the quiet pool, snorkeling in Kings Pond (yes, it's manmade, but the fish in there are beautiful and it got us ready for our snorkeling trip later in the week), walking along the beach boardwalk, and dinners at both Beach Tree (where they had a great live band playing) and Ulu.  Everyone on the staff we interacted with was friendly and helpful.  It's a splurge, but totally worth it.

145569485,40,Very lovely resort and peaceful resort,"From the moment you arrive at the resort you are made to feel welcomed. Everyone addresses you by name and everyone is extremely friendly and accommodating. Service is excellent. Just about every room has a view of the ocean and rooms are comfortable with a Balconies or patio. Housekeeping was great and you always had fresh towels. Very quiet and peaceful. Grounds are beautiful. Food is great especially at Ulu and the breakfast buffet couldn't be better. Sunsets are fantastic! Pools are beautiful and always enough chairs and lounges. it never appears to be crowded. Service for drinks and food are excellent. You can even rent a day bed by the pool and be treated like a king.    I was invited to dinner and volunteered to cook dinner but the half the folks at the dinner were vegetarians but shopping for food is not the best the area. The concierge had Nick the top chef at the resort call me to give me recommendations. He was very helpful as I was very frustrated by the quality at the stores, I can't thank him enough.    Highly recommend the spa. Top notch folks and very friendly. Beautiful surroundings for the spa.    The only bad is that some of the furniture needed to be redone as in some spots there were stains which did not sit well with me. This was mostly lawn furniture.    I do not recommend the hawaiian drinks here as they I not always use fresh fruit in all their drinks. However, they use good liqueur and a lot. Wine pours are generous. Overall I think this is a great place but a slight notch down compared to other Four Season only due to some of the dirty furniture.",Nov 2012,November 2012,Traveled with family,If you like peace and quiet stay were no kids are allowed.

145483129,50,Family weekend,"Before leaving on vacation, I had emailed Four Seasons to let them know that their spa website was outdated, some of the treatments I tried to book were no longer available. I was surprised as I think it must have been that way for a few months. I did call the spa to book an appointment, so at least I was able to do that. To their credit, as we were checking in to the resort, their concierge approached us and thanked me for my feedback. I am always amazed at how gracious they are even when receiving criticism.  The room was lovely as usual, and the kids were so excited to see THEIR welcome treats, which filled the bed, table, and bathroom with little touches just for them. It really sets the tone of welcoming the whole family. Some people we were traveling with remarked that the bed was the most comfortable they've slept in. Unfortunately for me and my hubby, our 3 year old in our bed probably kept us from saying the same thing. Haha!  Pool amenities are so impressive. First off, they ALWAYS greet you and set-up your area, which includes the chaise lounge covers, towels, and ice water, which they constantly refill so no one gets dehydrated. They even have swim diapers, sunscreen, and reading material available. It doesn't stop there. They also have times that they bring out fruit kebabs, ice cream, otter pops (sorry, don't know the generic name for these), and do sunglasses cleaning. They do have food and drink service starting from 11:00 a.m. Because I was there with 2 kids, we did some pool hopping, and got to experience the kids pool (sandy bottom, zero-entry, shallow pool with sprayers) which is perfect for toddlers and mommies who don't want to be IN the pool. The pool next to it is pretty with the waterfall, infinity edge, and adjacent hot tub. There's even a little nook on the oceanside of this pool that looks like a little grass shack. It's shallow enough to lie down in, or for the kids to sit up and play in. It looks to be big enough for 2 adults, but there is only 1 of these. And of course we made our way over to the King's Pond which is not to be missed. Snorkels and fins are available (no charge), and they have body boards with viewer holes, which was so helpful for little ones who can't quite swim yet but want to see fish. Even if you don't go in the water, you can still see the eagle ray and other fish swimming around. They do have scheduled eagle ray feeding and touch tank experiences too. We didn't go to the other 2 pools.  Enjoyed the breakfast buffet which gets switched up a little every morning. Food at the wedding reception we attended at the Residents' Beach Club was amazing. Huge spread and all of it quality stuff.  So what about the spa? Beautiful. I went early to relax before my 9:00 a.m. appointment and it was so quiet and peaceful, I imagined that it was my own private retreat. I do prefer the outdoor showers at Mauna Lani Spa, but I did love my green tea water cure and wrap treatment! To say I was scrubbed, soaked in a tub, massaged, and wrapped does not do it justice. The cedar tub is big enough for 2, as they do couples treatments. And I normally wouldn't do just a bath soak for a spa treatment (I can soak in my bathtub at home, but I cant massage my own back reasoning), but since it included the scrub and massage I thought why not? It was so relaxing and my skin was so soft afterwards, I think it was worth every second and every penny.  With so much offered at this resort, my advice is to take a look at the daily schedule to see what they have while you are there. Schedules are in your guest room and I've also seen copies at the pool kiosks.  And sure it's a beautiful location (those sunsets are captivating), but really ALL the staff make this resort stand out. You are taken care of the moment you arrive. And although it's a pretty penny to partake in this experience, what you receive in return can be a great value, if you take advantage of their included offerings (e.g. kids program, cultural center activities, pool amenities).",Nov 2012,November 2012,Traveled with family,,Hawaii

145256442,50,Amazing,"We just stayed here for the second time and it's a truly wonderful place. Four Seasons resorts are outstanding anywhere you go but this one is particularly good. The rooms are immaculate, the pools amazing and the grounds manicured to perfection. Not many people can afford to stay in a resort like this all the time but I suggest you treat yourself to this place at least once!    Here's three suggestions to enhance your stay:  1) Ask them for assistance. It sounds simple but to really appreciate the lengths they will go for you, ask them for something. If you're curious about a certain wine, they'll line up three bottles to try and explain the differences in great detail. Sunglasses need cleaning? Hand them over!    2) Get an ocean view room if you can. This is a large resort and many of the rooms are on the golf course. Still great but you won't get the same sense of ""place"" as you will with an ocean view room.    3) Upstairs vs. downstairs? The rooms are like townhouses and are either at ground level or 2nd floor. Both offer unique advantages. The second floor provides more privacy and a bit better view. The ground floor offers a cool outdoor shower grotto that many people love.    Last comment, this resort doesn't really have a beach suitable for swimming. It's a bit unfortunate but honestly, the pool service is so outstanding you won't want to leave there. Stay a few days here and head to one of the great public beaches like Hapuna.",Nov 2012,November 2012,Traveled as a couple,Ask for an ocean view if you can,"Scottsdale, Arizona"
145097357,50,"Our best hotel stay, ever!","We enjoyed a 7-night stay at this FS Hualalai in mid-October. This was our best stay at a hotel, ever! And it was worth the premium price.    We enjoyed the unique check-in described by other reviewers. We are not drinkers and they immediately exchanged out the spiked juice for virgin. The room we were given was as described in the reservation. I had been a bit worried that we (my wife and I) would yearn for a suite during the one-week stay, but the normal sized room was more than adequate, with ample room and furniture in addition to the bed. And the ocean-facing lanai acts as an extra room. This was an anniversary trip and we paid extra for a prime ocean view room in the Palm Crescent—that puts you with a better view of the ocean, but no outdoor shower. No regrets. We liked the quiet of the Palm Crescent and its proximity to the Residence Beach House. It was wonderful to see the ocean from the lanai, to hear the waves from inside the room and to lounge/read/dine on the lanai. The bedding is excellent, the beds comfy. Housekeeping is, as you would expect at a Four Seasons, first class. We noted the friendly, dedicated personal touch from all the staff, including Penny who cheerfully cleaned our room many times. When my wife lost a day or two to a bad cold, the staff responded by delivering a complimentary care package of healthy drinks and snacks!    The property is beautiful! The grounds are green, lush and manicured. Flowering trees are everywhere. The grounds staff is to be complimented. The combination of the grounds, the two-story bungalow buildings and the widely spaced crescents gives you a feel that you are staying in a private apartment complex, but with all the service and amenities of a world class hotel.    We were grateful to be on the breakfast package because the breakfast buffet was fantastic. Tierra was there most days and went out of her way to make sure we had great service. I love eggs benedict (and had 3 kinds during the stay), but Don cheerfully makes such great omeletts that I was tempted away from my normal routine 3 or 4 times! The tropical fruit was varied and fresh and the “juice of the day” was fun, fresh and delicious. The macadamia nut sticky buns are excellent, and worth the extra workout they prompted. We enjoyed great meals at Beachtree (Dasha is a great server—fun, with genuine Aloha warmth). We were lucky enough to eat at Ulu on its first night to open after renovations--the crusted Mahimahi preparation and pineapple sorbet/yogurt desert were highlights. The Residence Beach House was casual and excellent—the fresh mango smoothie required encore visits and the ahi wrap was super.    The spa is world class! Attention lap swimmers! The outdoor pool at the spa is a sparkling 4 lanes X 50 meters pool with good gutters, lane lines and a poolside pace clock. They have decent kickboards and pull-buoys, so leave yours at home. Fins too—but the resort’s fins were only ok. The best pull buoys are in a cabinet and you need to ask for them. Oh, and the pool is surrounded by flowering trees and shrubs. This is easily my favorite hotel lap swim pool in the world! I lap swim 4-6 times a week and decided to update my stroke with a private lesson. Ask for Rita! She teaches/coaches a swim class at the spa a few days a week and that class includes beginning lap swimmers and Ironman finishers. Rita can teach beginners, but she really knows her strokes. I learned so much and came home with some great drills. Beth was incredible for the pilates/yoga class my wife and I took (she was particularly patient with me, the total rookie). Jerry is a super personal trainer who listened to my requests and quickly provided me with a new custom workout. He followed up with an email workout card and short, narrated video clips of me doing the exercises with his instructions in the background, so I can continue the workouts at home.

144644940,50,Just keeps better!,"We recently returned from a fabulous week at the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai. Our 3rd visit in the last three years, and it just keeps getting better.    Arrival:  We arrived from Maui on the day of the Iron man race. Not the best time to arrive in retrospect, but we made it to the hotel in record time, and had the amazing experience of driving up the course. Not all vehicles had access, so it was fortunate to be going to the Four Seasons property. (We were told that those going to Waikoloa had to drive 1 hour and 45 minutes out of their way to get there). We used the hotel sponsored taxi service for $37.00 each way and it was perfect. The driver Catherine was absolutely lovely, and helped us with our bags. Once we entered the lobby we felt home again. The entrance is really unique, and the open air feeling reminds you that you are in Hawaii.    Resort:  This resort is so unique. The two level rooms are not intrusive to the design and layout, and don’t overpower the beauty of the resort. Coming from the Four Seasons Maui on the previous week, the tall building feeling of Maui cannot compare to the homey, relaxed feeling you get at this resort.    Room:  We booked with a Four Seasons Preferred partner and we did receive a complimentary upgrade. We requested a upper level room in a quiet area and ended up with an ocean view room directly behind the Palm Grove pool. The room was tastefully decorated, and very well kept. My only small issue is that they had a very strong orange-scented oil-type candle burning in the room when we arrived. It was so strong it set both my husband and my sinus/allergies into hysteria. We unplugged right away, and left it on the front step for housekeeping (with a note attached). I’m not a scent person, so this is sort of strange for a hotel room. Housekeeping staff did an amazing job, and we made friends with Celeste who cleaned our room several of the days. What a lovely person, and she did an excellent job. Even on our last day when we had been given late check out, she came by to refresh our towels and make our bed. Totally unexpected. Thanks Celeste!    I loved the amazing view of the ocean, but it didn’t feel very private with all the people at the adult pool. We really didn’t sit outside our balcony at all, because if we did, we felt like we were being watched. The Palm Grove pool gets extremely busy after 7:30 a.m., and doesn’t slow down until after dark. At around 3 p.m. this “adults only” pool becomes a “scene” and turns into the social pool. And as each drink is enjoyed, the volume of the guests increases. Didn’t bother us too much most days, but trying to enjoy a mid afternoon nap, we could still hear the loud conversations (although the rooms are really soundproofed). Overall, if you want super quiet, ask for a room on the far end of the crescent, closer to the rooms starting with 30/31. We were in 2812 and this was too close to the pool. Although, if you don’t care to be that close to the ocean, ask for the golf view rooms if you want a super quiet experience. These rooms are lovely, and the golf course doesn’t get that busy, so you feel very isolated (in a good way).    Restaurants:  We had 5 amazing dinners and a couple of lunches at the Beach Tree restaurant (because Pahu i’a was being renovated the week we were there). We were so impressed with every since meal we had, and we have to commend Chef Nic for his continued success with this restaurant. We got a chance to meet him on this trip, and what an interesting man he is. We tried almost every menu item, and the only thing I was disappointed with was the whole lobster. Not really worth it in my option, I would stick with pasta or steak. On the last night I ordered a “special”, it was chicken eggplant parmesan with prosciutto. Probably the hands down favourite of the week. I hope he adds this to the regular menu. Ordered room service on several days/evening and it was prompt and the food was fresh and tasty.    My only really complaint for the week was the limited seating at Beach Tree (with the other restaurant being closed). I made all my reservations in advance using their new booking system. But this hotel, as are many of the four seasons hotels, is family/large group centric. They have too many large tables and not enough tables for two. Many mornings we waiting 5-10 minutes for a table, and for dinner each night we didn’t get prime location. One night we sat next to a large table of 15 people, another night sat next to kitchen entrance, another night we sat next to the waiter station. I think they need to designate a nicer area for “two seaters”. It just seems like an after thought to them.    Excursions:  We took the hotel sponsored snorkel excursion with Alaka'i Nalu even after our difficult time the last stay trying to book this (and my claims to never give them my business). A year has passed, and I thought I would try one more time. We learned that they have something called guaranteed Thursdays so we were able to secure a confirmed reservation even though it was just the two of us. What an amazing day it was. I can’t believe that more people don’t want to do this. We snorkelled with a huge pod of 50 plus dolphins, and then on to two other snorkel sites. Our captain Daniel was really wonderful and one of the most memorable days we’ve had. I just wish their booking system was better, or that they didn’t cancel so many days.    We also drove over to Hilo one day, and visited Akaka falls. This was a gorgeous day, and worth the drive, even just to get different scenery.    Pool: We are not really pool people, but we did sit by the Beach Tree pool on a few days. The service was fast and efficient. And you get a lot more privacy at this pool, than you do at the adults pool. On one occasion a woman brought her young daughter to dive in and out of the pool, for about 20 minutes or so. There are signs that say no diving. I watched to see if any of the staff would say anything, and eventually they did. It didn’t really bother us, it was just that they were disrupting the people around them. I was impressed that someone did finally say something.    Rental Car:  We reserved our rental car in advance with National, but at the last minute we decided to leave Maui a day early and arrive to Kona on the day of Iron man. Needless to say, National did not have any cars available for the day we arrived, but assured us that our vehicle would be available the next day. When we picked our rental car up the next day they only had a mini-van available, and not the smaller-sized SUV we had reserved. This car was far too large, and it was difficult getting in any parking spot. Aside from the fact that we looked ridiculous driving around in a mini-van that seated 8 people, when it was just the two of us. We returned it the next day, and by then, most cars were back on the lot. The Iron man race does create a lot of unusual situations, so it really isn’t their fault, but they tried to tell us that the mini-van was an upgrade, when really with the poor gas mileage, it was a burden to us.    Flights:  We flew Toronto to Maui via Dallas on American in Business/First Class. On the Toronto-Dallas leg the crew were amazing, and the planes were fairly new. However, our sound didn’t work on both seats, so it made for a longer flight. On the Dallas-Maui leg the plane was older, but with the converted seats. Not the worst, but certainly not the best either. On the return flight from Kona, the plane was a really old 757 with original grey/brown leather seats, and the service was truly awful. I would never fly AA again from Kona, with these old planes. It’s just not worth it. The seats are very uncomfortable, and the flight attendants are on turnaround flight, and not the least bit interesting in coming around to check on you. I don’t blame them, they are going on hour 13 of their work day. On the return flight from LAX to Toronto, again, amazing crew, new planes. When we arrived in Toronto our one large checked bag was complete destroyed – the entire plastic core of the bag was smashed into pieces, almost as if it was run over by a vehicle. We stood in line for 25 minutes or so, and filled out the appropriate paperwork. We needed to drive 30 minutes out of the city to the closest luggage repair location provided by AA. They quickly determined the bag could not be fixed and allowed us to pick out a new bag. So it all ended well.    Overall, another fabulous trip. I love this hotel, and we are planning a trip back in April of next year. This time however we have booked Air Canada/United for the flights.",Nov 2012,October 2012,Traveled as a couple,,"Toronto, Ontario"
144390300,50,Paradise is There!,"Me and my husband decided to have a peaceful week in Hawai and the hotel was the perfect spot for that. The adults only pool gave us time for relaxing drinks in the afternoon and also the chance to meet very nice people.  Our room was facing the golf area and from our veranda we saw wonderful sunsets.  Other guests suggested for our next stay that we should be in the area of the fish pond. We may try in our next stay.. of course we are coming back!  The concierge staf did a lot for our stay too.  They suggested a trekking to the Kualalai volcano that was amazing. The guide Eric was very experienced and took us to places that we would never have the chance to see for ex into the lava tubes and the perfection of the silence there.  Eric was very helpful also and because of him we were able to get a private boat .This time, with Kathy and Rusty we dived with more than 100 dolphins ,saw beautiful coral reefs and even a manta ray. Our friends from the adult pool were on a boat with dozens of teenagers...  The breakfast and meals on the hotel were very good. Don't skip and chance of eating the Hawaiian fruits and specially the tomatoes,  In our next visit they will have a new restaurant , yes, one more option will be nice because you will want to eat at the hotel probably. Why leave paradise.  One last suggestion, if you go around the iron man time and want to have a car, reserve with anticipation.  We were not able to get a car because there were 10000 people in the island for the marathon .  But definitely seeing the whole island in a helicopter ride, reserve front seats , was much better than staying on traffic due to the number of people on the island.",Nov 2012,October 2012,Traveled on business,Golf view or close to the pond pool,"Palm Harbor, Florida"

The site of the hotel is beyond lovely — nestled on the shore among the blackened lava flows and banyan trees — but the service takes it a notch above the rest. Other Four Seasons locations could learn a thing or two from this staff. I can't speak to the area around the resort because it's so beautiful that honestly, you don't feel the desire to venture out. We ate only at the Beach Tree, which is the outdoor breakfast/lunch/dinner spot next to the pool. The sunsets from there are absurdly beautiful and we found the food to be very good. The excellent live music begins just after sunset and really adds to the ambiance. Golf course looked lovely, but we don't play. The gym is gorgeous and they offer lots of spin and yoga classes.

As anticipated, the hotel is an expensive proposition - especially when you have decided to treat yourself to oceanfront rooms - but if you can afford it, it is worth every penny. The rooms are fantastic and the beds extraordinarily comfortable - but if you want a real experience, get a room with an outdoor (but private) lava rock shower - WOW.    If you are doing an anniversary - ask about a private beach dinner - one of the most romantic nights my wife and I have every had - class act from service through to exceptional food. The Beachtree for lunch or dinner will not disappoint.    All of the pools are spectacularly maintained - we particularly like the adult pool by the Beachtree restaurant, but you must also try the Kings Pond - snorkelling or just hanging out it that area is fantastic.

It was such a great experience that my whole family still raves on about how nice everything were.

143953396,50,Brilliant,"What a fantastic resort!  After being slightly disappointed by the Four Season on Maui, we weren't sure how we would like FS Hualalai but we loved it.  It didn't get off to a good start - when we arrived the receptionist who greeted us couldn't find our reservation and we waited ten minutes, without being offered a drink, until she retrieved our reservation. The welcome Mai Tai's were, however, very good. We were taken to our room by golf cart by a bellman named Ian who gave us a very good overview of the hotel.  At the King's Pond end of the resort we were in an upstairs room ( resort rooms are either on the ground floor or one floor up) which was about ten steps away from the ocean. Spacious and welcoming, the room's decor was definitely laid- back Hawaiian. Bathroom was a good size and the walk-in robe an extra treat. Our lanai was perfectly placed to watch the beautiful sunsets and a turtle resting place. We were not impressed that guests stood right beside turtles to have photos taken, despite the warning notices that people should keep at least twenty feet away.  September is apparently not a busy month so there was no problem getting loungers at the Beach Tree pool. We did not try the serenity pool or the small area which allowed ocean swimming. Although the majority of the ocean front is not available for swimming ( strong currents, rocks etc), guests can walk along the sand and enjoy the sound of the waves.  We spent a couple of days relaxing in King's Pond which is stocked with lots of fish and even a friendly eagle ray. Snorkelling is good!  The main fine dining restaurant, Pahui'a was closed for 'enhancements'. We ate at the Beach Tree restaurant and the Hualalai Grille ( see separate reviews) and they were both okay but nothing outstanding. On our last evening we watched the sunset from the beach next to the Surf Shack, then ordered sushi - excellent. Definitely the best food on the resort and the servers were very friendly as well as efficient.  This is a wonderful resort, beautiful ocean setting, lovely garden areas, exceptional service - great for relaxing but with the opportunity to do lots of activities if you wish but how does a resort like the Four Seasons run out of English Breakfast Tea??",Oct 2012,September 2012,Traveled as a couple,,"Perth, Australia"
143902611,50,Everything was Outstanding,"My husband and I spent our 20th wedding anniversary here, and it was worth every penny. The property is spectacular and the service exceeded our expectations. I like that property is arranged in coves, with the two-story buildings arranged in a semi-circle that face the pool and ocean. My husband and I asked for an adult-only area, and we were given a room in the Palms cove. (On the other hand, the Seashell cove caters more to families, with its kid friendly beach and pool). Of course an adult guest can use any of the pools and other beach amenities. We reserved a second floor prime ocean view room, and we were not disappointed. Our room (2810) had a direct view of the pool and ocean, absolutely perfect!    The restaurants were excellent. Loved the breakfast buffet at the Beachtree, casual place for all three meals. For lunch, we loved the crispy chicken tacos, and loved the braised beef short rib for dinner. The restaurant above the club house served great steak and seafood.    Service was perfect. They provided a complementary bottle of excellent quality champagne on the evening of our anniversary. Everyone - without exception - was warm, friendly, and helpful, and willing to our of their way to make us happy.    My husband played a round a golf, and loved the views.

143594729,50,"""Garden of Eden""","Allow me to set the scene: Hubby and I are in our early 30's, we have 3 young children (whom we left at home with Grandma), we have never travelled outside of our home country Australia before and we are celebrating our 10 year wedding anniversary. The last time we had any more than 2 consecutive nights alone together was 10 years ago on our honeymoon. All this being said we had HIGH hopes and HIGH expectations of our Hawaiian trip. FS Hualalai, exceeded my wildest dreams - which can be difficult at best to meet.    Upon arriving at Kona airport, the FS hospitality is immediate as we noticed our chauffeur holding a FS sign and a smile for us. He promptly retrieves our luggage and ushers us to our cool, luxury sedan (organised by concierge). After about 20 hours of airports and three plane trips later we arrived at Hualalai. Sleep deprived and hungry, the anticipation of this resort mounts as we zoom past the scarred volcanic landscape of the Big Island, along the extended road that begins to glimmer with green as we draw closer to our destination. The serenity is instantly calming,and the friendliness of all staff notably genuine.    Before we can blink we are escorted so swiftly up a flight of stairs into a grand lobby, I remember distinctly ooohing and gushing as ocean breezes waft through the expansive windows and the heady scent of a plumeria lei is draped around my neck. My husband receives the customary nut lei for males. The beauty is simply breathtaking! Mai Tais await, as does cool face cloths - check in is completed promptly on comfortable couches. Amazingly, as we arrived 2 staff members were standing in the centre of the lobby awaiting our arrival. It is as if one is royalty!    To save you the verbose praises of the most amazing 3 days spent here, I will complete this review with a few of the following highlights:  The food at Beach Tree was outstanding! As the main signature restaurant was undergoing renovations we dined for breakfast lunch and dinner on all 3 days at the Beach Tree. Regardless of what we ordered it was consistently amazing! The marscapone Pizza in particular I still dream about and ordered twice - a must try! Also, the Linohau full body spa experience takes you to another place - 120 minutes of pure bliss! And worth every expensive penny!  (Just as a side note, we are not wealthy at all, but simply a couple who appreciate quality, beauty and exceptional service. It is our experience in life to get these things one has to be prepared to spend the money for it, so if those are things that are also important to you, then you will find this to be a enriching experience, that will not disappoint).    A special thank you to Katie at the spa, Jason at beach tree pool side who appeared out of no where often offering to take photos of us, Barry who showed us to our room and Ryan at front desk reception who was so professional and patient (as I struggled to understand the gratuity system, as in Australia tipping does not exist as a part of our culture). Also to Jenna at Beach Tree Restaurant, who was genuinely friendly and warm - when I think of FS i will always think of you guys, as you are now synonymous with the Four Seasons service.    If you are keen to stay at this resort but concerned about the $$$ outlay, my advice to you is turn that part of your brain off. Throw caution to the wind and just BOOK IT! It is the splurge of a lifetime that you will talk about for years to come. It is a ""Garden of Eden"", the closest thing I could imagine to paradise on earth, with service to match.

143496994,50,"Yes, it is all that","According to my travel research this is arguably the best resort in Hawaii, and from what I saw I would wholeheartedly say it is number one. Here's why:  Grounds: it is an oasis in the lava fields north of the airport. Lush green landscaping everywhere, the several amazing pools (the snorkeling one, the tranquility one with swim-up bar, the adults-only one with tented cabanas, the family one, the one carved out of the beach, the lap one at the spa), the walk along the coast, the golf courses ...  Service: staff learns your name, service is top notch all around, friendly and always willing to help. I wish check in could be so relaxing at all hotels (cooled towel, mai tai, ...)  Food: all very good -- buffet breakfast (currently at the Beech Tree restaurant), poolside service for lunch (though expensive -- this is the 4S after all), Beech Tree for dinner and Hualalai Grille for dinner. I enjoyed both -- Grille was more sedate and relaxed, but the view at the Beech Tree was incomparable - plus there was a nice local trio playing Hawaiian music the night we ate there.  Room: we visited twice during our vacation, and enjoyed both our rooms. The first was a second floor room overlooking the sea shell (family) pool and the ocean beyond. Awesome view, relaxing deck. Although we weren't traveling with kids this would be a great place to take them. (While there were many kids at the resort, there is a lot of space and they didn't impinge on our adult vacation either). OUr second visit was a first floor room tucked behind the beech tree restaurant, with a beautiful view of a little garden and the top of the lighted beech tree itself at night. The benefit of first floor rooms is an awesome lava-rock outdoor shower. I loved the louvered doors that, if opened, automatically cut off the a/c so you could enjoy the ocean breeze, which year-round is about 85 degrees. My wife now wants a 4S bed at home.  If you're looking for understated luxury & pampering and can afford it, go. THe only caveat - while there are beautiful places to sit on the beach, it is not an expansive sandy beach so if that is what you're into I suggest looking elsewhere. (There is some beach - but there are also rocks offshore so not the best for ocean swimming, except in the ocean pool).

142899999,50,A Tale of Two Properties,"""It was the best of times, it was the bestest of times.""    This is a tale of two properties on two Hawaiian islands. Each tale is about The Four Seasons – the first being the Four Seasons in Kona on the Big Island of Hawaii and the other being The Four Seasons on Maui. They have to be told in tandem because you really can't appreciate one without the other.    Our story begins with our honeymoon beginning at the fantastic Four Seasons Hualailai on the Big Island of Hawaii. It was our first time to the Big Island and as a reward to ourselves for our Wedding we choose the Four Seasons because it's always listed as the premier resort on the Island (much less that part of the world).    To say that this place is ideal would be a gross and punishable understatement.    But I'm getting ahead of myself.    Driving unto the property you feel as though you have arrived at any number of countless golf course resorts found throughout Hawaii, California, and Arizona. It is only until you reach the front entrance that you start to realize that this isn't your typical resort. Nooooooo...    It's stunning! The entrance has a modern-yet-retro Polynesian vibe to it. The floor plan is wide open and from the very start you begin to actually smell how beautiful this place is (literally... the place smells sweet and fresh). You are greeted with cold drinks and even colder vanilla chilled hand towels. Shortly thereafter you are escorted to your bungalow (room, apartment, etc.) via golf cart with a short tour of the grounds. This is needed as the grounds are vast and spread out.    The room we had was in a quiet section and to the far left (as viewed from the water). This was perfect as Honeymooners we appreciated the privacy. The room was beautiful and seemed to be almost brand-spanking-new. The design was light and airy with a retro Hawaiian feel but with all the amenities that you expect from the Four Seasons -- big comfy bed, large dark marble bathroom, tub for two, AND a view overlooking the ocean that was truly spectacular. And because our room overlooked the ocean, we were fortunate to see the beach lit up at night thanks to one of the restaurants (out-of-sightline) that placed klieg lights on the breaking waves.  Room Review: 4.5/5    Okay, now for the resort itself...    Pools Pools Pools.  There are three pools that are spread from left to right: The Kiddie Pool, The Big Square Pool, and The Adult Pool. We visited all three pools during our week stay and can honestly say that all three are great. The Kiddie and Adult Pools are infinity pools while the Big Square Pool is exactly that. Each pool is very well designed. The Adult uses flat tiles that seem to soak up the sun and allows it to reflect a cool dark hue, where the Kiddie Pool has tile made out of small circular marbles. The Big center Pool has beautiful smaller dark tiles. Each pool has a hot tub, and the Adult Pool has a swim up bar (more on that later). Each pool overlooks the beach which is no more than 20 yards away (Adult) and less than 5 yards away (Kiddie). The pool was never packed or overcrowded while we were there. In fact, it was pretty much empty. We had our choice of where to sunbathe and the service at poolside was second-to-none.  Pool Review: 5/5    Time to Eat.  We ate breakfast each morning at the Beach Tree Restaurant which is to be seen to be believed. Located to the right of the Big Pool, it overlooks the stunning beach and it's namesake Banyon Tree. The breakfast buffet was excellent. No shortage of choice and everything is crazy fresh. We ate dinner here a few nights as the Chef's menu as good as anything in New York or Chicago (Tuna Carpaccio was F-ing fantastic!). There was also a Steak house on the grounds but we didn't eat there (It's Hawaii... we want seafood) and the third restaurant was under construction.  Food Review: 4.5/5    The Ambiance.  The place is laid out like a sort of Disneyland for rich people. I mean the place actually SMELLS incredible as you walk around the grounds. The landscaping is immaculate and there is never a time when you pass by a hotel employee that they don't say ""Aloha"" to you. Add the swaying palm trees, the colorful birds, the sounds and sights of waves crashing on the beach and you have an idyllic paradise.  Ambiance Review: 5/5    But what about the other property that makes this story you ask?    On the second leg of our honeymoon, we spent a week at the Four Seasons Maui at Wailea.    I'm gonna go on record and say that this is a very beautiful and upscale resort BUT coming right from the Four Seasons Hualalai, this is like driving a BMW sports car AFTER driving a Ferrari 550 Barchetta Pininfarina. They are both stunning in their own way (but you know which one costs more and why)    The Four Seasons Maui is a wonderful property. It seems elegantly dated. –– I mean this in a kind way but there are a few key areas they could update if they truly wanted –– i.e., no ""real"" infinity pools, etc.    The resort is totally Four Seasons which means the service and amenities are top notch. But it's like you are staying in Miami and not in Maui. What we experienced on the Big Island seems to be lost in Maui. The Hotel is not very architecturally significant to Hawaiian culture the way the Four Seasons resort is on the Big Island.  Ambiance Review: 3/5    Where we had our choice of poolside chairs on the Big Island, we had to get up early and actually HOLD a seat before they are taken. The Adult pool in Maui is very ""Hollywood"" (which by the way, is labeled ""The Serenity Pool"". This is there only infinity pool BUT it's on an upper level and looks over the beach which is about two stories below.) and the small amount of seating is gone by noon. The main pool was actually quieter than the adult pool with more seating options.  That being said, The Four Seasons Maui has a beach you can actually use. Snorkeling and Paddleboarding here are excellent.  Pool Review 3/5 (update the pools please)  Beach Review 5/5    Rooms are more standard here and much less ""Hawaiian"" but they feature bathrooms that are almost TOO BIG to be taken seriously with your choice of music to be played in them.  Room Review 2.5/5 (update the rooms and show a little ""aloha"" in them)    The staff here is just as nice and helpful as the other Four Seasons and the valet parking (mandatory) are always willing to grab you free cold water bottles and help with your bags.    Food Review: 4/5 (room service only which was actually very very good.)    The ONLY negative comment is this -- why in the world would you charge $18 for a drink? It's criminal and unjust because, honestly, there is NO drink worth $18. Each person we spoke with felt the same way. In fact most would drive off property to the the local store in town and buy beer and spirits to bring back to the resort.  It would make guests happier to stay and lounge in the pool longer if you didn't need to take out a second mortgage to buy drinks on a Tuesday afternoon.    There you have it... a short tale of two properties, Four Seasons Resort Hualalai at Historic Ka'upulehu and the Four Seasons Maui at Wailea. Overall, an excellent, relaxing, and wonderful Honeymoon –– just enjoyed in the wrong order. (but we'd do it again in a second)    Aloha and Mahalo.

I went home well rested and enjoyed the surroundings of the property and the ocean sound brought back many memories of going to the beach while growing up. I realized how much I missed it since we live so far from the nearest public beach. I also loved having a pedicure and my daughter enjoyed the spa and a pedicure. Most of all the service was so awesome and we were just overwhelmed! And the idea of going green......wow! My favorite was the outdoor shower. If I could have more than two showers a day.....I would do it. I would recommend this property to all my family and friends who visit the Big Island.

142554741,50,Hualalai Four Seasons - Excellent in Every Way,"In late September we returned for our annual/anniversary trip to Hualalai and were not disappointed. This time we had two young kids with us, as well as guests/friends who met us for 5 of our 10 day trip. This is at least our 16th stay at the resort and it was 99% excellent.    The rooms are excellent, and we paid the ""upgraded"" fee for an ocean view suite and the view and extra space was worth it for our family. One of the restaurants was closed for renovation during our 10 day stay and the Beach Tree was more than accommodating for breakfast and other meals. The Hualalai Grille is now a steak house and worth a try (we ate there twice).    The resort manager was ever/appropriately present and gracious.    Yes, you will pay $$$$ for excellent service, location, and meals, but if you want a first-rate Four Seasons experience, Hualalai is the choice. We spend 4 to 5 weeks a year in Hawaii and while we like the remoteness of Lanai, and the beaches of Maui, Hualalai will always be our favorite spot.    If you golf, the resort course at Hualali is ""ok"", and Sid the ""cart guy"" is truly the reason to play a round there. But, if you want to golf Manua Kea, Kukio and Nanea are the best courses on island.

142529879,50,We felt like royalty every step of the way,"First time at a Four Seasons, hands-down the most amazing experience with a hotel EVER! We were greeted at the gate by name, car valet parked, luggage taken to the room as we were escorted to a sitting room for the paperwork bit of it all. But not before enjoying a cool towel, fresh pineapple, and a mai-tai (that was quite strong) served in a coconut. We immediately felt welcomed, relaxed, and taken care of.    We were offered a tour of the property in a golf cart before being dropped at our room. The grounds are very spread out so you never feel crowded. With 5 pools and a beach, we never felt too-close-for-comfort to other guests. The fitness area was huge! lap pool, yoga center, cardio theater, free weights. There is also a Salt-water snorkle tank with no waves and free equipment. Demonstrations with sea creatures for kids, but super interesting for adults too. 4 restaurants including a sushi bar open late and of course, room service 24/7. Even after seeing the entire resort, our room was still breathtaking! An ocean-front suite, worth the splurge. Outdoor lava rock shower, private lanai, and the sound of the ocean to put me to sleep :) on super comfortable king size beds. Free coffee, Tea and Banana bread in the rooms. yum!    Breakfast buffet, although expensive at $35, but amazing. Bloody Mary was the best I'd had. Every meal on the resort was delicious, though we couldn't afford to have every meal there. Fresh towels and ice water the minute you sit down by any pool or the beach. Concierge is very helpful with anything you need, off-resort dining recommendations, new robes/towels, privacy when we needed it, chocolate covered strawberries on the house for the honeymoon, you name it!

We were keen to explore the island and the concierge was particularly helpful in organising car hire, a helicopter flight, a swim with the dolphins etc. There was plenty to do around the resort e.g. we took stand up paddle boarding lessons, fed the eagle ray and played poolside games. The dining was reasonably good (though the main restaurant was under renovations).

141696577,40,Gorgeous Hotel,"The Four Seasons in Kona is undeniably gorgeous and luxurious. However, if you are on a couples trip, beware there are a lot of family and kids at this resort. We were on our honeymoon and the room on one side had a family with middle school age kids running around on the lawn in front of our room and the other room had a couple with a baby that cried each morning. However, there is an adult only pool with a swim up bar that is in one word - amazing. There are limited lounge chairs though so make sure to get there early.    The rooms are beautiful and the cleaning staff leaves you a little treat each night like milk and cookies. The resort is very extensive with multiple restaurants and tiki torches everywhere. Only one restaurant has breakfast in the morning and it can get kind of crazy - so I recommend ordering room service if you can. You can't really swim in the ocean there so it's more of a pool resort. Also, private dinners on the beach aren't really worth it - you get a great sunset view from the hotel restaurants and the beach dinners aren't very secluded - ours was on the beach in front of the middle of the resort.

141598866,50,Great Stay at the Best,"Just returned from a great vacation at Four Seasons Hualalai. You see so many positive reviews of the resort it is hard to believe. But...believe them all. This a wonderful property that consistently exceeds expectations. The resort staff is amazing and does a wonderful job.  Management-  The hotel management team is excellent. I was originally concerned when we learned the Pah'uai Restaurant was closed for renovations during our stay. However, prior to our trip William the Assistant Food and Beverage manager called us at home and ensured there would be adequate dining options. I was impressed he made a personal call prior to our arrival and followed-up by speaking with us during our stay. He was absolutely correct the dining options were again excellent. We met some of the management team at the Manager's Cocktail Reception including Robert Whitlock and Reba. Extremely professional, genuinely interested in the quality of your stay and willing to help in any way.  Food-  We had dinner at the Hualalai Grill (2), Beach Tree (2) and Resident's Beach House. The meals were excellent with great food and service. We enjoyed the ambience and food at the Grill (request outside table), the Beach Tree was wonderful for dinner, drinks and the buffet breakfast is not to be missed. Steve the bartender at Beach Tree is great, friendly, makes tremendous drinks and has a world of local knowledge. Nick Mastracusa the Head Chief at The Beach Tree introduced himself on our last night and provided us with a wine tasting from Badia a Coltibuono. He went out of his way to make us comfortable and even offered to teach my wife to cook a sauce during our next stay.  Rooms-  Excellent View. Great to hear the surf at night. Housekeeping staff kept the room spotless. Very comfortable and well appointed.  Service-  Great. Pool and beach staff were excellent. Hotel reception and staff are the best.

141538687,50,Great place to come to relax,"Just returned from 5 nights staying in a Golf Ocean View Superior Suite. The room was huge and gorgeous. The golf/ocean location seems more private than the majority of the other rooms that surround the pools but is more removed so a little more walking is involved. The views from the suite were more golf than ocean with the ocean in the distance but still beautiful sunsets from our huge terrace. The resort is very removed and remote. We only ventured offsite once to do the volcano helicopter tour, expensive but worth it (we drove to Hilo, gorgeous drive and stopped at the falls, and did the tour from the Hilo airport, 50 min in helicopter was perfect amount of time). If you like golf you will love this resort (we are not golfers). Our time was spent lounging by the various pools and relaxing. The resort is gorgeous and the service amazing. Our only concern was the food, it was good but not great. Prior to our visit our friends said we would love PAHU I`A but unfortunately it was closed for ""enhancements"" so we never had a chance to experience what looks to be the most fine dining on the resort. We visited in September and the resort was quiet so I understand their choice to renovate the restaurant now. At the end of our 5 days we were really bored of the food, if PAHU I`A had been open and we had another food option on site that would probably not have been the case.

We've stayed at other Four Seasons resorts on the other islands. Best part of this property was the beautiful grounds, as this resort sits right on the oceans edge. As others have stated, not all the beach area is swimable, but there are some areas where you can swim/snorkel. The sand is a little sharp on feet so take care. Their sunsets are magnificent. They say its the gases emitted from Kilauea Volcano which produce the beautiful soft-colored hues that light up the sky.    Now, for the disappointments. We had the bed/breakfast pkg. The buffet breakfast was awful and staff there seemed overhwhelmed. Food sat out in heat of day without proper cooling stations (fruits, salads, egg/pancake batters).

In the morning, I loved sitting on our lana'i with a cup of tea and taking in the gorgeous setting, birdsong & ocean. Ahhhhh.... total relaxation!    The cultural center on property is a treasure. Kaumana graciously gave of his time & knowledge as we asked a ton of questions. Had we been on property during the week for more days, I would have taken all the classes offered!    Mmmmm.... food.... The teriyaki chicken sandwich on a sweetbread roll; the tomato & goat cheese on flatbread; the lemon ricotta pancakes; and the gnocchi with oxtail ragout. So Delicious! The gnocchi was the best ever. Chef Nick said the gnocchi is his grandma's recipe. Little pillows from heaven with the tenderest oxtail - he did his grandma and Four Seasons proud.    Bravo to Four Seasons Hualalai for sourcing 75% of the food locally and supporting over 160 farmers. Eat fresh, eat local, and eat sustainably. Woohoo!    I took time for a spa treatment - lomilomi massage. The massage therapist was Erica and she was terrific. When making my spa appointment, I noted my allergies to certain products.

I've been waiting for a time that I could actually sit down and write the very lengthy glowing review that I've been wanting to write. However, that time never came so I figured I better write something because it was a trip we will never forget! At the time of our trip the kids were 4 and 7.    As for the rooms, there is something for everyone. Rooms are located around each of the four pools. The one with 4K+ fish, the family-friendly pool, the mostly adult pool and the adult-only pool. There are also some rooms facing the golf course and not by a pool. All buildings are two-story. If you take an upstairs room - you get a clear view of the ocean and a balcony. If you take a downstairs room you may or may not have a clear oceanview and you get an outdoor lava rock shower. No lava rock shower for upstairs room. So, your choice. We had a downstairs room by the family-friendly pool - LOVED it because the kids could in/out easily from the patio door.    Room had no noise issue for us. Plenty of space. Twice daily housekeeping meant that they took out and put away the kids sofa bed. Walk-in closet and spacious entryway a plus. Our bathroom had plenty of space - again, loved the outdoor shower. Housekeeping will also provide a child step stool if asked - it was a nice study wooden one. Loved the L'Occitane products, especially the after sun lotion that isn't even available on the L'Occitane website! Super clean and comfy bed. Nothing to complain about.    Food was high-quality and nothing to complain about either - except that the alcoholic drinks are very expensive (try mid-teens to $20's for a mixed drink - oh well, you're at the FS - live it up!). Food is reasonably priced for what you get. Lunch entrees mid-teens to $20's. Dinner entrees high $20's to low $40's. Frankly, it's similarly priced to Roy's and even the Hilton (and the Hilton's food quality is pretty low). Kids meals around $9. The chicken tenders were sliced whole chicken (3 pieces) with fries and papaya for around $9. I was at the Hilton in April 2012 - they charged $3 each for chicken strip that looked like rubber and sat under a heating lamp.    An absolute must is the Sat night buffet. $80 per person is well worth it when it will cost you the same for a 3-course dinner at Roy's. Kids half price and little ones 4 and under are free. Leave room for the dozen+ choices of dessert!    When booking your travel dates, keep in mind that the Cultural Center is only open on the weekdays. There are a ton of complimentary activities and we did a lot of them, but they are not open on the weekends. Flower-lei making, flower head-piece making, bracelet making, a variety of music classes, etc.    Free snorkeling lessons in the fish pool, educational sessions in with a biologist at the touch tank, a variety of kids floaties and sand toys for your use, sunscreen provided poolside, otter pops for the kids, fruit kabobs, sunglass cleaning - all complimentary.    My husband and I took advantage of the spa facilities every day (no extra cost unlike some other hotels). Steam room, sauna, whirpool, cold plunge - all included, no extra cost. He also had a massage - loved it. The gym is an outdoor and indoor facility - gorgeous and plenty of equipment but I didn't use anything. Group exercise classes available for $10/class.    Kids Club a fun place to go. Unfortunately, my younger was too young to be left there without us (she was 4) and her big sister didn't want to be there without her so we did not use the complimentary kids program. Next time! I did speak with the child care providers - they are well-organized and professional, a friendly group of staff.    Wifi cost reasonable. $10/day for one device at somewhat slower speed. $13/day for three devices at faster speed.    Went golfing - absolutely amazing! Definitely worth it. Loved the GPS-equipped golf cart with the color monitors.    Something to watch out for that we were not told about... the restaurant upstairs from the golf shop and Cultural Center is technically not part of the FS and is run by the Hualalai Resort. You can still charge the meal to your room, but the kids-under-4-eat-free does not apply. The kids-under-4-eat-free is only at the FS restaurants (and not poolside either).    While this island is the youngest of the islands so the sand is not super fine, my kids still loved playing on the beach, building sand castles, etc.    We were also there to attend a wedding. The wedding, reception and all wedding-related events were excellent.    What else can I say, gorgeous property, plenty to do for kids, places for adults to getaway from kids, clean and well-maintained, excellent service, no holding lounge chairs and worrying about where to sit (though we left before the Christmas rush) - I cannot wait to return!

138123640,50,Great for the entire family,"I had been to this resort 4 years ago and for some reason, I wasn't blown away. I had the highest expectations and found the experience lacking. Notwithstanding, when we decided to go back to the Big Island, we opted to give the FS one more try. This time it was different. I'm not sure if it was the weather (last time there was a vog issue) or if it was because we had the kids but our experience was sublime.    Room: we had a room by the seashell pool ( the family pool). This room was right in the middle of the resort and had easy access to everything. The resort is spread out and with kids in town, proximity is key. The room was a ground floor unit with outdoor shower. Again this was great. Free use of laundry facilities was also a nice touch. Rooms were well appointed. Decor was tasteful and simple. Housekeeping was stellar.    Pools: There are pools fir everyone. Our kids loved the infinity edge seashell family pool and king's Pond (a saltwater snorkelling lagoon with thousands of fish. My wife and I enjoyed the Beachtree pool with a great view of the ocean and the adults only pool. There is also a pool built into the ocean (a little rocky) and a laptop pool at the spa.    As has been noted before, there is no real swimmable beach although you can walk to such a beach (10 minutes away).    Facilities: Best gym of any hotel I've stayed at. Good weights room, cardiovascular facility and studios. This would be a good gym by any standard. No views from the gym like some hotels but the views from the rest of the hotel make up for it.    Our kids also participated in the complementary Kids for All Seasons program. It was stellar. For nominal fee, there were daily ""special"" activities like rock climbing, canoeing, drumming that the kids loved. This gave my wife and me some alone time and family time. Great mix.    Restaurants: We had breakfast at Pahui'a daily which was made up of a very comprehensive buffet. Really good. Other than that,the only meals we ate on property were at the Beach Tree restaurant. Very fresh ingredients and a good variety of options. The fish tacos were my personal favorite. There was a kids menu too which was perfect for the little ones.    Luau: The Four Seasons now offers a luau on property which was very convenient. It was pricey ($150 per adult and $80 per child). The food was the best I've had at a luau (braised shortribs, lobster tails, fresh grilled sworfdish). It is done buffet style so no limits on what you can eat. There is an open bar and they served a good strong maitai, beer and wine. They had juice for the kids. The show itself was good but not unlike any other luau (although the fire dancers were pretty spectacular). Overall, it was a nice night but our family preferred the Polynesian Village luau in Maui which we saw on a prior trip. The food at the Polynesian Village was not nearly as good but it was much more interactive and better for families with smaller children. Overall, probably not worth the hefty price tag.    Ambiance:. Very laid back. This is what Hawaii should be. Service was great but not cloying and the whole experience is very serene. If you're familiar with the FS Maui, this is very different. Much less of a ""scene"" but just as luxurious. It's not necessarily better -- just different. On the downside, you do run into guests that have a sense of entitlement and listening to the way they talk to some staff made my blood boil. However, to the staff's credit, they manage to diffuse the situation very well. I guess they have experience. Overall, you will not find a better ambiance anywhere on Hawaii.    Summary: I could not have been happier. The whole experience was simply impeccable. We took a day trip to the volcano (highly recommend) and it was great to come back to this home base. Staff was super across the board and when things didn't go as planned (our room wasn't ready on time), the staff made it right. The question is not whether we'll be back, it's simply a question of when.    If there are any specific questions, feel free to flip me a message and I'd be happy to respond.",Aug 2012,August 2012,Traveled with family,"For families with kids, a room around the Beach Tree pool is ideal.

There really isn't another hotel/resort that reaches the level of luxury on the Big Island. Forget about the Marriott or the Hilton....those hotels are a different category anyways. Hualalai really only competes with the other Four Seasons hotels in Hawaii (i.e. Maui).    This is a wonderful hotel with wonderful service. I won't go into all of the super aspects of the hotel since they have been diligently noted in previous reviews. I would point out that the resort gets very busy during holiday periods....so much so that you are likely to have issues with reserving tables at the restaurants. This is no minor issue since you cannot easily stroll to a local restaurant, since there aren't any.    If you do go during a holiday season, I recommend reserving tables well ahead of arrival.

The Luau at the resort was also a great night out with entertainment. We all enjoyed massages that can be done by the cabana. The spa was very nice, we had several treatments & loved the outside massages. Shopping, the clothing store had great things that filled up my suitcase & my husband surprised me with a beautiful ring from the jewelry store... it's one of my favorite pieces. The little market was a great place to pick up a bottle of wine & some snacks for the room. We barely left the resort except to go fishing & swimming with the wild dolphins.

The equipment to work out offers a broad variety of machines and weights, and even classes. This was the only place during our vacation where we truly wanted to work out!

We arrived on a Friday and left on Sunday, but, it was a little slice of Heaven.    I wanted an upstairs room, but, was pleasantly surprised by the amenities in the downstairs rooms. The room was decent sized with the typical jumbo flat screen, coffee maker, walk-in closet. The bathroom is large, with dual vanity, tub, specialty toiletries. The real treat is the shower that walks-through to a very private, outdoor shower!    Since we only had two nights on property, we ate at every restaurant and the food was very good. The property didn't seem overcrowded, so we were served fairly quickly. I didn't think there was anything overly memorable, but, not bad.    For those high rollers who can afford to bring their kids to the property, there are separate pools and kids camps. Not that I don't love my kids, but, decided I would prefer not bringing them to a FS property. On our scheduled ""sleep-in"" Saturday morning at 5 am, we wished the parents of the kids screaming outside our room, had the same courtesy. Oh, well. It takes all kinds to make the world-go-round.    One of my bucket list courses is the Hualalai Nicklaus Course. I see it on TV, every year as the Champions Tour gets underway. I think I saw, maybe, three or four other groups out there and I ended up squeezing in 27 holes in four hours; your own private country club. Wifey rode with me and enjoyed the scene, as I surprised myself on some tough holes. The interesting thing is that the course includes a pond that they raise the shrimp in. These shrimp are the ones you eat at the restaurants. Luckily, I hit the par 3 green and didn't pollute the water.    The spa is really cool and they have this walking ""river"" that includes stones for reflexology and coarse sand for exfoliation. We both got 90 minute, deep tissue massages. If you need some deep tissue work, ask for Kyle. Wow! The spa amenities are wonderful and you can use them the entire time you are at the resort.    On Saturday, we took the free 7am walking tour. It's a nice 45 minute walk around the property, so you see a lot of nice homes/golf course views/water views, etc. The workout facilities are very nice and loaded with machines/free weights/spinning classes/yoga/pilates classes. The lap pool was virtually empty, so no waiting.    We had a later flight on Sunday, so we checked out at noon and were invited to use the spa facilities at our leisure and check our bags at the bell desk.

Another thing to consider is that the resort is fairly isolated approximately 20 minutes from the nearest town. The resort is surrounded by private properties and golf courses. I did 4 dives/2 days and that ended up taking a good part of the day by the time you drive into town. It is possible to never leave the hotel grounds and be very happy because they offer paddle boarding, out riggers, snorkeling, rock climbing, basketball, yoga and fitness classes an amazing gym, walking trails, tennis, golf, shopping and multiple swimming pools. The laundry facilities are scattered all over the property and are very convenient. The refrigerator was large with plenty of space of you want to keep it stocked.

134860523,50,"Most Sybaritic stay, even with family","I stayed here alone when this resort first opened years ago. I just stayed again, now with my husband, 2 small children (under 5) and my mother in law in a 2 bedroom ocean view suite. We normally stay at Mauna kea but I have to say after this stay, we may change to hualalai. They have really improved things all the way around. After the tsunami, they added a pool for little kids (4 and under) that was perfect. Food has improved but not on par with the rest of the resort at their fine dining. The small details in service make this place special and luxurious. Consider the complimentary cold scented washcloths and refreshing spritzs offered by staff at the pool. Or, the small packet of woolite left on my vanity next to my soaking swimsuit. This is 5 diamond service at its finest, anticipatory and discrete. Just lovely. The gm must be very experienced and good. The staff are really really great. Thank you.",Jul 2012,July 2012,,,"Waimea, Hawaii"
134775793,50,Absolute Luxury,"When we landed on the Big Island, we were a little unsure of what was going to greet us at the Four Seasons. Briefly, the Big Island looks like outer space near the airport.    Driving in the taxi (which we organised through the hotel) was really amazing too, the driver pointed out tunnels caused from lava, etc. The resort was like an oasis of green amongst black...quite amazing.    They greet you like you are someone special. We were greeted with cocktails and leis by the manager, another person and even had the manager of food came to discuss their restaurants (unfortunately, it had been a very long trip to get there and I can't remember their names or their proper titles).    We were driven to our room in a buggy and shown around the resort which was great. Every person that works at the resort will say Aloha as they walk past...something our son loves because unfortunately, people aren't as friendly back home (and as we found, at other resorts).    The suite was fantastic and I highly recommend the golf an ocean view suite for the view and the location. It was fantastic because it was at the quieter end of the resort as it is not close to pools. If you rent a car, you can park it outside of your suit/room.    We were on the ground floor which meant that we had an outdoor shower which is a nice extra as well...though we had two bathrooms inside - one with a steam shower which was fantastic as well! The bathroom had L'Occitane products which is always lovely. The room was modern, clean and well furnished. The only downside was that in the US they don't have kettles (which we needed for my son's bottles - for hot water) but they delivered a bottle warmer within minutes of my request. Such is the service here that everything is done promptly and without the feeling that you are putting anyone out.    They had a lovely chocolate platter when we arrived that was a wonderful touch. I am not talking about a few chocolate bars but an ornate chocolate feature with difference types, textures and shapes of chocolates to look like shells, sand, etc. Beautiful.    We were travelling with our toddler and they provided a crib in our room....in the crib was a basket of goodies for him including a soft toy (which he loves), bath products, etc and a bib with his name and Hualalai embroidered on it. A lovely keepsake.    The restaurants were all fantastic and had great service. Highly recommended. We only ate at the resort the whole time and didn't run out of places to eat or feel the need to eat elsewhere. We ordered room service on the first night (jetlag meant we felt like dinner well after 10) and the serving sizes were large, the meal was fresh with crispy chips (which you don’t often get in room service) and delivered promptly.    The resort is beautiful and clean (they spend a lot of time maintaining the property). I have never seen so many frangipanis in my life. There are chairs that they set up for you at the beach and all the pools. There are a number of pools, we ended up locating ourselves near the toddler pool most of the time because it is a wonderful lagoon type pool for toddlers. It's not deep, has a sand bottom (so they don't slip) with a small water feature. Perfect. No other resort I have ever stayed at has something like this. They really cater to children here.    The beach was amazing too. No need for special tours to go out to see sea creatures like turtles, which come right up to you. Our son was amazed. I should add that they have a special pool for snorkelling with animals but we didn't go there. We also didn't go to the adults only pool.    Absolute luxury. We wish we had spent more time there. We look forward to returning in the future.",Jul 2012,June 2012,Traveled with family,We had a golf and ocean view suite. It was fantastic because it was at the quieter end of the...,Australia
134739859,50,"Excellent hotel, excellent service . . . loved it","We stayed in one of the private homes on the resort with our family of 4 (kids ages 11 and 8) in July 2012, so I can't speak to the rooms, housekeeping, or concierge services. But everything we experienced at this resort was first-class: from the attentive poolside service to the friendly and excellent tennis staff to the impeccably cared-for grounds. This place is gorgeous and every detail has been thought of (illuminated ocean at night to enjoy the views, electric lawn mowers to reduce noise, complimentary sunscreen, etc.). We spent most of time at the Children's Pool which was nice (if a little too warm), but the adult's pool was beautiful and serene. The restaurants were beautiful and afforded great ocean-front experiences (esp at sunset), but the food was a little disappointing, especially in the high-end restaurant Pahui'a. For those prices we expected outstanding food; it was good but not great. The other restaurants had more casual and consistently good food.

134732418,50,Incredible experience,"This was our first stay at a Four Seasons, and it exceeded our expectations. Usually we stay at a Marriott or Westin, and this was far superior to them. We considered the reviews of other travelers before we booked, and found the reviews discussing superior service to be completely accurate. The property itself is like no other; beautifully landscaped with the wonderful pool settings. The ocean pool and separate private snorkeling area for hotel guests are like nothing I have ever seen before. We were warmly greeted by name almost everywhere we went, received personal unexpected ""touches"" like having our sunglasses cleaned at the pool, cool water being refreshed constantly, the maid service being superior to our own housekeepers, etc. Dinner at the Beach Tree was not only beautiful, but the food was incredible. I concur with other reviewers who say having a room with an outdoor shower is unique.

134426939,50,Met our high expectations,"We stayed here for five nights and, prior to arriving, our expectations were very high as this hotel had been recommended by a friend who deems it to be the best Four Seasons hotel in the chain. We were in a golf view room with an outdoor shower. The view from our lanai looked out across the golf course and the ocean. While it was a short walk to the pool, we found we enjoyed the fact that our room felt a bit more private and quiet than those facing the pool/ocean areas. Both the Beach Tree and Pahu i'a are excellent and we regret that we didn't make reservations for dinner for more than just a couple of nights as both restaurants were completely booked during peak dinner hours while we were there. Compared with other Four Seasons hotels we've stayed at, this hotel does seem to go the extra mile with special small touches. For example, left a pair of sunglasses in the room and, as part of the room cleaning service, they left them on top of a FS lens cleaning cloth. The pool service can not be beat and we loved having the option to move into a cabana in the afternoon to escape the sun.    Overall we had a great trip and plan to return!

He knew that the highway would be closed for awhile, decided we could sit at a bar instead of on the highway. Great idea. Had a few drinks at the bar, explained our problem and asked if we could eat in their restaurant. They were all booked, but once word got out that their was a death in the accident and the highway would be closed for 2 to 3 more hours people were unable to get to the resort and cancelled their reservations. The staff came and got us right away so that we could eat. Great meal, staff was very helpful with suggestions of what to eat, drink (wine) and what do do while we were on the island.

They are incredibly friendly and smiling all the time. I think its the closest to royalty one can get.    I love Hawaii and have been there ten times in the last 5 years.

133914901,50,Absolutely Incredible,"We stayed at the resport for 5 days around July 4th and now understand why people rave about this hotel. The resort is incredible and more than impressed us at every turn. I am generally not a fan of huge resorts and went on this trip expecting what we got at the Maui Four Seasons a couple of years ago--hit or miss service, over-crowded pools and mediocre food. We could not have been more wrong. The resort is huge but because it is so spread out, it doesn't feel crowded at all (they were almost at full capacity when we were there). The grounds are magnificent and spotless, and the service will blow your socks off. They cater to your every whim. For example, we ordered off menu at every beachside/poolside lunch and it was not a problem, and valet filled up our car with gas before we checked out so we didn't have to stop at the gas station. Our ocean view room was huge and stocked with all of the amenities you expect from a Four Seasons. The room had a lovely balcony where we could watch the sunset and was serviced twice a day. The property has several pools and lots of chairs on the sand, all of which are regularly serviced by pool/beach attendants that bring around fruit kabobs, smoothies, cold towels, etc. The food at the resort was the best we had on the island. I strongly recommend the Pahu i'a's Saturday night buffet. Not a huge fan of buffets, but the grilled lobsters and steak, fresh seafood, and sushi stations made this an amazing meal. Finally, there is free WiFi throughout the resport. Overall, this is an incredible resort, with service that is above an beyond anything I have ever experienced.",Jul 2012,July 2012,Traveled with friends,,"Los Angeles, California"
133913807,50,Family-Friendly Luxury,"Based on recommendations from friends, I had high expectations of this resort. It exceeded them. It has the nearly flawless service, tasteful decor and comforts that you would expect from a Four Seasons property. But the stunning, beautifully landscaped location right at the water's edge transforms the resort in to an extraordinary experience. And it works for the whole family. We spent spring break there with our young daughter (along with a lot of other families), and the resort's thoughtful features for kids --kids' pool, family pool, daily kids' activities, kid-friendly (but not dumbed-down) menu options at the restaurants-- help adults and children keep up a happy, relaxed coexistence that's truly feels like a vacation for everyone.

133613134,50,Perfection,"My husband, two daughters (ages 12 and 18) and I arrived for 10 nights on June 21 at 8 pm. It had been a long day of travel from Toronto, through San Francisco. I saw a representative from the Four Seasons when we landed and I gave her our name before heading to Avis to pick up our rental car.    It's a short but dark ride from the airport to the hotel. We managed fine but I know older people may be disoriented by the lack of light. (We're in our 40s.) They were ready for us at the hotel when we arrived. You are brought over to a couch in the beautiful open air lobby to check in. (If you arrive at night, you won't fully appreciate how lovely it is until morning, but it is stunning in the night time light.) As there were 4 in our party and the hotel only allows 3 to a room, we had booked 2 golf ocean view rooms. I requested the ground level so that we could have the outdoor showers. We were told at check in that we had been upgraded to two ocean view rooms on King's Pond. Lovely. After some cool towels and refreshments, we were taken by golf cart to our rooms.    They were lovely - the girls were each left a present on their bed; a stuffed state bird of Hawaii for each girl (thank you for knowing that an 18 year old girl still likes getting a stuffy!) and our younger daughter was also given a bracelet and our older daughter a robe to take home! (A short version of the robes kept in the room for use during our stay.) Later during the week, housekeeping brought a robe for our 12 year old's hawaiian bear that she had brought on the trip - sweet touch!! (BTW, housekeeping was great. They came twice day. We were also left two goodies trays during our stay; cheese plate and chocolate plate.)    The decor in the rooms is lovely. The l'Occitane products are kept in large bottles (good for the environment, which made us all happy) so don't plan on bringing any products home with you. We loved the beds and the showers and I took a bath each night.    After unpacking (ample space), we went to Pahu i'a for a drink and some munchies. The kitchen was closed but they offered to open it for us - very sweet but we said no. Instead, they brought us some flat bread with our drinks, which was perfect. We climbed into bed by 9 or 10.    The next morning I was up at 5 - that's my norm. I found my way to the lobby, which was a short walk away. The hotel layout is such that rooms are really part of small clusters of bungalows, none higher than 2 stories. Though spread out, everything is rather close. Anyway, in the lobby, they had coffee, tea (lovely organic teas from Canada!) and muffins out. They did this each day - other Four Seasons that we have visited do this too - wonderful touch. After having some coffee, I went for a run. The running trail along the water is beautiful. Serene. I had brought my Garmin (I ran the Kona half marathon while we were there) but only used it the first day. They have 2, 3 and 4 mile routes mapped out for guests. I highly recommend heading out for a run.    When my family woke up we headed over to the Pahu i'a brunch - wonderful. We had purchased a bed and breakfast package. More choice than ordering off the menu and breakfast a la carte is pricey. If you're not big breakfast people and get up early, you could go get a muffin and coffee in the lobby gratis, but they do run out. Lovely fruit, homemade granola and yogurt, eggs to order, pancakes, french toast, pastries . . . the buffet breakfast is amazing.    We ate lunch on the beach a few days. If you sit by Pahu i'a, the menu is the same every day. There's also a great lunch menu at the Beach Tree Restaurant. I preferred that. I believe that the people that sit on the section of beach by the Beach Tree have a different beach menu. I don't know as I never sat there. But needless to say, you'll find something yummy. Drinks are very good too.    We swam in all the pools - we preferred the quiet pool by the Beach Tree Restaurant and my husband and I enjoyed a drink while sitting in the adult only pool. If we went alone, we'd have spent more time there.    We had dinner at Pahu i'a (sushi - loved it, loved it!) and spent the $80 per person to each at the Sea, Sand and Stars buffet. We are not big buffet people, except for breakfast. This is not your average buffet. Sushi, lobster tails (I ate 3 - the night before my race.), crab legs, ocean salad (a seaweed salad that is beyond fabulous) . . . a full dessert table - just do it. Is it expensive? Yes. But it's worth it.    We had two delicious dinners at The Beach Tree too. They have live music and entertainment while you eat - makes for a wonderful Hawaiian experience.    Off-site, we enjoyed a great dinner up the mountain in Waimea at Merriman's. We also went to the Manta and Pavilion Wine bar at the Mauna Kea, which has a lovely beach, but the hotel looks like The Contemporary at Disney and it is just not as nice as the FS. Plastic white chairs and tables in sitting areas just doesn't cut it for us. The beach there is gorgeous and the restaurant was nice as it has a special wine storage system by which they can serve a large number of wines by the glass in 1,2 and 4 ounce pours. I loved that. Food was good, view was great. We probably wouldn't return though - we loved the food, convenience and ambience at the Four Seasons.    The resort grounds are stunning and well-maintained. There are always people working and pruning and painting - the facilities are very well maintained.    We went to the cultural centre 4 mornings to make shell bracelets - lots of fun and our girls made some to bring back for their friends. Our younger daughter and I took ukelele lessons - what a hard instrument to play! There are so many activities to take part in - it's up to you how much you want to do!    We shopped in the resort store by the spa and workout area. Some nice things there and they are not as pricey as the clothes in the gift shop under the lobby. The golf shop had some great men's shirts - coming from Canada, we took advantage of a holiday from 14% sales tax.    We learned that the spa is actually owned by the Hualalai development - they have what appears to be a great partnership with the FS. I did not have a spa service, but our daughters and I used the spa facilities the day that we checked out to shower and change. When you arrive, ask for a tour and you may use them more. Supposedly, they do not allow people under 14 in the locker rooms. We were not asked how old our daughter was on the last day.    My husband golfed two days at Hualalai (loved it - scored a 70 and a 72, I believe). He's a very good golfer. He also loved golfing at Mauna Kea - 75 there. He enjoyed Mauna Lani (similar score there) but did not like Waikaloa. If you're a good golfer, skip that one.)    Our daughters and I did a day trip to Hilo. We drove up to Waimea, drove to the Waipo outlook (stunning), continued on to the Akaka Falls (walk the loop - fabulous!) and went on to Hilo for lunch and a visit to the Pacific Tsunami Museum - very small but worth some time. We ate at Cafe Pesto in Hilo - decent food - before heading back. We left around 9 and got home at 4.    We found that many guests repeat each year. We will definitely return. July and August are more expensive (we came in June because of our younger daughter dances all of July and heads away to camp in August) but also more crowed. We noticed that the resort was getting busier on the Saturday that we left. A lot more people on the beach and around the pools. I spoke with someone in reception and she said May and June are less busy.    This was truly one of our best holidays ever, if not the best. The service was pure perfection. The only two recommendations that we have: install toilet bowl seat lids that don't slam (we've done that through out our own house) and have fans in the bathrooms in the rooms.

133317542,50,A slice of heaven on earth...,"Having traveled and vacationed in many places, my wife and I always end up returning to the 4S @ Hualalai every year because of the amazing location/activites on the Big Island, the incredible service, the amazing attention to detail, and the sheer indulgence made possible by the Four Seasons. This trip, however, was the first to the 4S @ Hualalai with our children ages 10 and 5. Immediately, our kids were made to feel special with personalized amenities and messages in our room waiting for them. They completely enjoyed the Kids for All Seasons (KFAS) program the 3 days we went scuba diving. The program is well organized with many activities and friendly counselors. Some activities are really neat such as the shark feeding in the pond next to Pahuia. There were 3 small sharks (2 blacktop reef sharks and 1 hammerhead) recovering in the pond at this time. Otherwise our kids had a blast snorkeling at King's Pond, swimming in the lap pool, goofing at the Sea Shell pool, and rolling in the waves on the beach.  The facilities at Hualalai are bar none, the finest of any hotel in Hawaii that we have personally stayed at. The rooms are expansive and extremely well appointed with properly functioning AC that properly dehumidifies (something that was lacking in many other Hawaii hotels IMO). The outdoor showers attached to the 1st floor rooms are wonderful. The Spa is out of this world. Although, I preferred jogging along the beach paths every morning. Tough to beat the ocean lapping against a beach or lava coast with, on a clear day, seeing Haleakala on Maui in the distance. My wife and I had the best massages I have ever had at Hualalai. My wife also indulged in a wrap treatment (Linohau) which had her skin literally glowing.  The golf course is a very nice and friendly resort course with an absolutely outstanding staff. Juniors under 12 play for free with an adult. In addition, it's a private course only allowing play from 4S guests and homeowners/guests of Hualalai resort, so that makes pace of play superb. it also allowed me to take my 10 year old in the afternoon without any pressure.  The food is excellent IMO. We had a wonderful beachside private family dinner with a private waiter. The breakfast buffet at Pahuia is my favorite place on earth for breakfast with the ocean 20' from one's table. Lunch and dinner at Beach Tree are also excellent. We were bummed when Alan Wong left the Hualalai Grill. But, the Hualalai Grill just re-opened the week we were there as a steak place but we did not have time to try it.  In conclusion, the facilities are top notch without parallel in Hawaii. But, it is the amazing, unassuming, unobtrusive, unpretentious, friendly, helpful, and complete service of all the staff in all the locations from the bell desk, front desk, concierge, housekeeping, wait staff, golf staff, spa staff, etc that make it the perfect combination of relaxation, beauty, and luxury.",Jul 2012,June 2012,Traveled with family,1st floor rooms have an outdoor shower.

133282569,40,Almost perfect.,"Just returned from a completely relaxing vacation at Hualalai. I left this place feeling pretty blissful and convinced it's definitely the best place on the island to stay.    Pros  - Grounds are gorgeous, room was kept spotless, housekeeping was quick to respond to our couple of minor requests. Outdoor shower was delightful, soap/lotion/hair products were delicious    - This was off-season so take it with a grain of salt, but the beach chair areas were not ever overly crowded. I never felt overwhelmed with waves of children or other guests. Aside from the family pool, the atmosphere was calm and for the most part quiet    - Beach in front of Kona Village, the adjoining, but closed, resort is a hidden gem! Sure, there's no bar service, but hardly anyone wanders over there. Snorkeling off that beach is FANTASTIC. Great coral, lots of turtles and schools of fish. Everything you see in the stocked Kings Pond, but way better. Go before 10 am for calm waters and clearer visibility    Cons  - Not enough service at the beach/pools. Don't get me wrong, the folks working those areas are running their tails off. There just are not enough of them. We usually had to wait 5+ minutes for a chair to be set up and had to flag someone down for food/drink orders. Definitely never saw the over-the-top service described by some. No one circulated with sunblock, sunglasses cleaner or water refills. I don't mind getting off my duff and getting stuff myself, but that's not the experience we were paying for, I don't think.    - Bell staff was a little... how to put this... gesticulating for tips. I travel light and arrived with one carry-on bag. Two bellmen kinda sorta helped me and then both sort of loitered wondering who was going to get tipped. I really felt like the guy who ultimately showed me my room wasn't going to leave until I handed him a couple of bucks. Smarmy. Seriously dude? I'm didn't arrive with eight heavy bags, two car seats, a double wide stroller and some golf clubs. One bag. Drop it and get out. Housekeeping and pool staff never acted like that. Perhaps some of the nice folks at Beach Tree pool or King's Pond should be swapped up to bell staff.    - The food for the most part was good, but not all that interesting or exciting. Loved the sweet pea ice cream with candied pea tendrils served for dessert at Pahu i'a. Peas for dessert? Absolutely! That sort of fun and adventurous take on food is what I'd expect for the price. Fish portions seemed particularly small at Beach Tree. Late morning breakfast + bloody mary at Pahu i'a was nice each time; Great service.    - Lack of adult activities. Would love to hear a horticulturist talk about native Hawaiian plants, a short lecture from marine biologist on King's Pond or something on Hawaiian history or arts and crafts that didn't have to accommodate six year old attention spans. (Then again, just laying on the beach not learning anything wasn't so bad either.)    Overall despite a few staffing hiccups Hualalai was totally worth the price.

132249396,50,"Perfect, perfect, perfect!","Having been to 26 countries on both luxury vacations and not, I am very particular in planning my trips. The FS Hualalai exceeded all my expectations for both myself and my husband. First, we had the golf-ocean view. If you think that just because they are less expensive that you are missing out, you are not. The rooms are FS quality and luxurious, the views were awesome and the service was flawless.    I can't tell you what fabulous service the FS staff gave to us at every turn. The property was gorgeous and relaxed and not pretentious. It was an amazing experience.    Day 1 - Arrived at Kona. Look in to cab versus FS shuttle prices. Also, I was hoping the FS shuttle would take our bags, but no...we had a rental car so we boarded the bus for it. Check In was fabulous. You walk in and are greeted by a drink and steered to a sofa where you sit down to check in. Fabulous! No standing akwardly at the front desk! We were given a tour of the property and went for a drink at the bar. Awesome, friendly service at every turn.    Day 2 - Couldn't sleep in due to the time change (we're on EST), so we awoke to a beautiful sunrise. Had breakfast oceanfront with french press Kona coffee at Puhu i'a. Everything we ordered was perfection no matter what day - even when I ordered oatmeal one day when I had an upset stomach it was served with everything you could want. We never did the buffet, but it looked great. This was a pool day, so we spent most of it at the adult pool to decompress. Sunscreen (and water) is available for free at the pool! Great if you forget yours or need to touch up. Also, the drinks were fabulous. I had no problem paying $12 for a drink...it's the FS, for one, and it was worth it!    NOTE: Before 8am, there is coffee and small pasteries complimentary in the lobby. So if you don't want a big breakfast - we usually don't - this was great.    Day 3 - Went scuba diving with Kona Diving (we're advanced certified). Friendly outfit. Saw some creatures I had never seen before. Nudibranchs that we don't get in the Caribbean, frogfish, cool eels, swam through lava tubes. Went to check out the spa when we got back, but didn't use it. Looked fab. Also a lap pool that had coffee and water all day. Had dinner on site, but ate upstairs in the FS Puhu i'a bar.Excellent all around.    Day 4 - Concierge gave us a map and we drove north to the Akaka Falls. Stopped a few places in between. Drives are longer than they look on the map as many speeds are 35mph and/or going through microclimates! It rained half-way up, then was sunny again.    NOTE: If you want a car, rent a jeep before you go. Much *cheaper* (relative to renting when you get there). Also, don't take the top off the jeep - just roll down the windows. My husband owned a jeep and we had trouble putting the top back on - thanks to the FS staff for helping us!!!    Day 5 - Had lunch at the Beach Tree. Had a seafood salad sandwich that had tons of seafood in it and hubby had tacos that were great. Went to the pools in the afternoon and my husband played golf. Found out that you can play golf essentially all day for one price! More scuba. Did a Manta night dive - really cool and a great way to do a first night dive...but we had the 1 out of 10 where there were no Mantas ;( But I DID see my first bioluminescent organism! Very, very cool!    Day 6 - Husband played golf and LOVED it! All day! A round in the AM and one in the PM. It seems that as long as they aren't full, you can spend all of your time on the course for one fee! He rented his clubs and they were great - gave you water all the time (no charge). And the scenery on the course was unlike anywhere in the world!    Day 7 - Drove south and around to get to the volcanoes/Hilo/observatory. Take a jacket/wind breaker as it is cooler and can rain. Stopped in Kona for lunch. Excellent place right next to the Theater - had the wahoo tacos. Stopped at the bakery at the southernmost point in the US for coffee and a pastry. Then off to the volcanoes! Truly awesome! Hiked the Ika Trail and stood next to steam plumes - takes 2 hours + to hike and go right when you enter. (We didn't see lava, but we had a helicopter tour with Blue Hawaiian the next day where we saw the entire island - volcanoes, lava, waterfalls - that you can't see by land and learned a lot!) Around 4pm we drove towards Hilo and then onto the Observatory. Hard to find the turn from highway (which is sometimes banned by car rental companies, but it was fully paved and nice except for 1/2 mile?). Can be COLD, and the drive can be interesting through the cloud cover, but it was worth it! It was a full moon and we saw Saturn through a telescope there!    Day 8 - Last full day. Just chilled. Did the helicoptor tour with Blue Hawaiian and got the CD to remember the fabulous trip!    We were disappointed that we didn't see mantas and that our deep night dive was cancelled (not enough people; the other operators were full!) so we went to the Sheraton to the Manta Lounge and watched as a female (they are much larger than males) and a male or juvenile female did loops off the bar.    Day 9 - Our flight didn't leave until late, so hubby played more golf and I went to the pool. Spent some time at the King's Pond where you can snorkel with TONS of fish and a sting ray. Water is VERY cold, but you can ask to borrow a shorty. They thought of everything! Ate at the Hualalai Grille above the pro shop. It's a sports bar type place, with great views all around and excellent lunch.    This was the best vacation we have ever taken! And we've done a lot!

132132098,50,Perfect and relaxing,"We just returned from our 5 day stay and it was one of the best vacations we have ever had.    Room - #110 beach front. I thought it was worth it paying the extra for the beachfront. The ocean view rooms have a great view but they are set back and one of the pools is directly in front of them. The oceanfront rooms are steps away from the ocean. It was wonderful falling asleep to the sound of the waves. The room is large and I loved how far the sliding doors went so you get that indoor/outdoor feel. The air conditioning automatically shuts off when the doors are open.    Service - the staff here really go out of their way to spoil you. Everyone we met (with the exception on one rude waitress at the Beach Tree) went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed.    Food - I thought the food here was great. Its definitely not innovative cuisine, but I think they do everything well. We preferred the Pahu'ia Restaurant to the Beach Tree. But that's mainly because the Pahu'ia has a great buffet breakfast everyday and we preferred the seafood to the Italian inspired food they serve at the Beach Tree. And at both of the restaurants you can watch the sunset during dinner. I also recommend having the private dinner on the beach. It was beautiful and very romantic.

There are also lots of nice beach chairs set up all along the beach if you tire of the pools!    The rooms are huge with plenty of room to stretch out. Beds are super comfy & you won't want to get out in the morning. Bathrooms are also quite roomy, but for the size of the showers, they could've put some more shelves & a bench in them. Lots of room in the closet too with nice robes, plenty of storage & even a beach bag to use.    Check in was pleasant and efficient done in one of the sitting areas of the beautiful lobby, complete with lei greeting and complimentary Mai tai (very yummy). Service was a bit spotty after that. Some staff was very warm and gracious, others were efficient and professional, yet anything but warm. It made us feel like they didn't want to be there.

131558295,50,Treated like Royalty,"For my review, I'm copying the text of a letter I'm sending to the manager of the resort. You'll get the idea.    Dear Sir:  I am writing to thank you and your staff for again making our vacation a wonderfully memorable one.    Last evening, my wife and I had reservations at Merriman’s in Waimea. Upon arriving at the restaurant, after a 45 minute drive, we found it to be closed with a sign on the door saying they were “sold out” for Tuesday June 5 and would re-open the next day. Needless to say we were quite upset and disappointed.    I called the concierge desk to find out what had gone wrong, since our reservation had been made and confirmed by your staff weeks prior. The concierge, Staci, checked and found that indeed the reservation had been confirmed by Merriman’s hostess on May 28th. She then informed us that she had received approval from your assistant manager (I apologize that I have forgotten his name) for my wife and me to have complimentary dinner at your Pahui’a restaurant.    Upon arrival back at Hualalai (after another 45 minute drive) we were greeted by the attendant at the resort entrance who upon inquiring of and receiving our names, apologized for our inconvenience and informed us that we would be greeted at the lobby and escorted to dinner. At the lobby we were met by both Staci and the assistant manager who both apologized to us. At Pahui’a we were greeted by the chef and taken to a beautiful table for two next to the beach. Our waiter had also been informed of our trouble, and mentioned how sorry he was for our difficulties. Indeed, every staff member we encountered was apologetic and solicitous of our comfort and enjoyment of the evening without being effusive. Our meal and the service that attended it were superb, including a delicious appetizer that we did not order, offered by the chef.    To conclude, your staff turned what could have been a very bad memory of our long anticipated vacation into one our happiest ones. And all of this was done even though clearly Hualalai was not to blame for any of our misfortunes.    This is why we love Hualalai so much. My wife and I are teachers – not wealthy or famous by any means, yet your staff consistently makes us feel like we are the most important people at the resort and that our enjoyment of our vacation is their primary concern.    Sadly, tomorrow is our last day before we must return home, but rest assured you will see us again. Being Kama’aina, we have stayed at many resorts in Hawaii, but none come close to The Four Seasons at Hualalai.    Sincerely,  Steven Schick",Jun 2012,June 2012,Traveled as a couple,,"Oahu, Hawaii"

131540584,50,Can't believe it took me so long,"Firstly, we were here last May, not July, but the format wouldn't let me go back further than July, 2011. I can't believe it took me so long to write this review. We are fortunate to travel fairly extensively and through work opportunities and other reasons have been able to stay in some remarkable locations and properties. I AGONIZED over this decision. We started our trip in Maui on business and stayed at the Grand Wailea. I wrote my review of that property on that forum. When we went to the Big Island, we were on our own. I am a travel junkie and a researcher extraordinaire. Each time I choose a property it's after much reading, weighing of options and consideration. Most people would call it obsessive....I went back and forth over the Mauna Lani, the Fairmont Orchid and the Four Seasons. I was out of my mind with the idea of spending the $$$ for the Four Seasons, yet I couldn't get it out of my mind. I'd never stayed at a Four Seasons before; not because of any particular reason, we just hadn't. I'd been to plenty of Ritz Carltons, St. Regis' etc. and typically like smaller boutique hotels anyway. I'm not a big resort person. Finally, after getting an awesome deal on a website that is willing to combine perks!!!! we chose the Four Seasons. We had a golf course view room, with an upgrade if available at check in, with full b'fast for two daily and 6, yes 6 spa treatments for $600 per night. All I can say is that it was worth every cent. We didn't get an upgrade; some large group was at the hotel, but to be honest, I liked the golf course rooms. You could see the beginning of the beach and although I love a water view, it was so removed from the rest of the resort, it was totally peaceful. The lay out of this place is gorgeous and smart! Rooms are in separate little areas with either a pool in front of them, the golf course or the beach. The whole thing is only two levels and it feels Hawaiian to me. I've been to Hawaii 4 times and I don't understand why people who review this hotel say they don't think it feels Hawaiian. I tell you what, I've been to the Hilton Hawaiian Village that tries very hard to make you feel like you are in Hawaii, but one step out the front door or onto Waikiki Beach and you might as well be at the Jersey Shore. The Hualalai looks and feels like peaceful, gorgeous Hawaii of your imagination. The property is stunning.    Rooms:  Beautiful. I also don't understand when people say they are let down by the room. I'm not quite sure what you are expecting. The bathrooms and outdoor showers are AWESOME. Get one. Don't get a room without an outdoor shower....The beds are great, pretty and the decor was Hawaiian without going ""cheap Hawaiian,"" if you know what I mean. The closet was huge and although some people complain on this site about the noise, again, the golf view rooms were quiet...lovely.    Staff:  Great, nice, not pretentious, helpful, discreet. I loved it. I don't like to be ""over"" helped, and this staff knows the difference. They were there when you needed them to be and not when you wanted peace. Their training was evident from the minute you walk into reception and they give you a drink in a coconut and know your name. I felt like they could do anything I wanted and do it with a smile. I am not comfortable with too much kiss butt waiting on you, but by day 2, I never wanted to leave...I'm happy to admit I've been spoiled.    Resort:  Again, stunning. One of the most smartly designed resorts or hotels I've ever been to. Nothing ever seems to far, yet it's spread out along the beach. The beach is gorgeous; just what you imagine a Hawaiian beach to look like. It's not the Caribbean, folks, so don't expect calm, super clear, aquamarine water. it's the Pacific and it's a rugged island. Loved the turtles I saw EVERY day, and loved the ""real beach."" Imagine a little bit of the movie, ""Castaway.""    Pools:  Something for everyone! Kings Pond is AWESOME. It's like your very own aquarium to snorkel etc. I just kept thinking that my kids would never get out of it. It's salt water, sand bottom and a little piece of protected ocean swimming. And you can eat and get drinks there too! The adult/quiet pool was very quiet! I don't like places that say they have a quiet pool and then don't enforce the quiet. Here, it was quiet. The only thing I thought was odd was that there is a swim up bar in this pool and typically once people start drinking, they get louder. I think they may have set themselves up for some problems here. I would serve drinks here, but a swim up bar atmosphere doesn't really fit with a quiet pool to me. The main pool has cabanas, shade, food and drinks. Loved it. Beautiful. Also two oceanfront hottubs on property.    Food:  Restaurants were good and I thought the food was really good. I loved the beach barbeque the one night. Bars were fun, drinks were good. Yes, it's expensive, but we knew that going in. What can I say? Food service was efficient and one day my burger was undercooked and when they brought the new one, the paid for both my husband and my lunches because we weren't able to eat at the same time and share our dining experience. I loved this place! Restaurants are beautifully located so that the amazing scenery is never too far to see. Bartenders and servers were all great. Again, training was clear.    Spa:  OMG. Loved it. Loved the environment, the serenity and the treatments. Such a cool location and so calming. Totally awesome.    I would go back to this resort in a heartbeat and pay all over again if it weren't so darn far away. It's one of those places. Hawaii is magical and when you travel that far (from NJ), it's an oasis. We went to dinner at the Mauna Lani one night so that I could check that property out and stopped at the Fairmont on the way. Both were nice, and it's not fair to judge a place based on either one meal or one walk through. The dinner at the Mauna Lani by the way was great and the location of the restaurants is awesome. All I'll say is that both my husband and I felt we most decidedly made the right resort choice and based on the properties, probably would have been disappointed had I not chosen the Hualalai.  So...if you can't decide and are sweating the cost; pick a golf course view room, and just get the best deal you can for the Hualalai. You won't regret it.",Jun 2012,July 2011,Traveled as a couple,"If you want really quiet, choose rooms either overlooking Kings Pond or the adult pool. We loved...","Branchburg, New Jersey"

Upon arriving, we were greeted by the friendliest and most professional staff I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. They pronounced our names properly, valeted our vehicle and promptly had out luggage delivered to our rooms.    A staff member then greeted us with shell leis, a cold moist towel, pineapple and Mai Tais. We were duly impressed by this point. The lovely wedding coordinators, Shea, Sarah, and Jenna made our wedding a dream come true. There wasn't a single detail they hadn't considered and they made it an unforgettable night. Shea especially treated us like royalty and did everything in her power to make sure every aspect of the wedding was fine tuned.    Our room had an ocean view. When I say 'ocean view' I mean it. This isn't some corner of a reef or you needing binoculars to see it. We looked out our window and there was the beach being gently lapped by tides. It was literally breathtaking. The resort has bungalow style rooms which is a nice change of pace from the glorified Holiday Inn rooms we stayed at elsewhere on the island. The staff is always inconspicuously around the corner when you need them and they attend to you as if you're the only guest they're waiting on for the duration of your stay.    The grounds are superbly maintained. There wasn't a single blade of grass growing the wrong way and the resort smells absolutely divine in every corner.

The shower was gorgeous and had nice aromatic soaps and shampoos. In fact, we preferred to use what they provided because we loved the scents so much! Housekeeping was simply amazing. The room was consistently clean and they even folded our clothes and organized our toiletries! I like things to be neat so that was a nice bonus. We had fabulous ocean views, were only steps from the beach and could see the Pond from our room. To us this was our favorite part of the resort. It was very quiet and the snorkeling was better than our boat ride down the coast! And there is nothing like being lulled to sleep by the oceans' waves...no sound machine here; just the real thing! The grounds were meticulous and secluded with winding paths to anywhere on property. This does not have a ""hotel"" feel at all. Instead it was like staying in an oasis with bungalows secluded from other guests. The food was fantastic and fresh with delicious seafood. The staff was amazing; so accomodating and friendly. You could tell they enjoyed working at such a beautiful resort. They made us feel like we were the only guests there; attentive but not overwhelming.

The resort design is really beautiful -- I think the highest building is only two floors, and the complex is laid out around a series of pools/lagoons that abut the ocean (although that's a bit of a strange design, in that it sets the rooms off the ocean itself). It looks large on the map, but the property is eminently walkable (and has lots of nice pathways to stroll) end to end. Each of the pools has a particular character (adult only, kids, etc.) which other reviewers have addressed.    We had initially booked one of the prime ocean view rooms, but upon reading reviews we decided to go with an ocean view golf room (happily, also the cheapest). I was so pleased with this decision that we kept this room even though an upgrade was available. The major advantages (and the reason we changed): we had a first floor room that had a lovely outdoor shower. It was a good size, and opened onto a patio with a table and chairs, that overlooked the golf course. The ocean is a bit away, and it's not a panoramic view (it's about 1/3rd of the view), but it is across the serene and scenic golf course, which makes it a quiet place without a lot of foot traffic/pool noise etc. This room has parking spaces just outside the room, so for us it was a major advantage to be able to self-park, and park closely, so that we could throw the stroller in etc., and leave stuff in the car without worrying that we'd have to order valet service to get something out. This would not necessarily be a good room if you have kids that want to go to the pool etc., but it's great if you want a quiet and serene place.    This is a four and not five star review for two reasons: 1) We arrived exhausted (after our 11+ hour flight), unpacked, and found the air conditioner was not working properly. That would have made this a three star review, since I find it totally unacceptable to pay what these rooms cost and have a broken A/C upon arrival... BUT, when we called for assistance we were sent a maintenance person named Roger, who was phenomenal. Frankly, I was shocked that someone so competent would available at all, much less at that hour, and to me that speaks highly of the Four Seasons management, so I bump them up a star for fixing things quickly. 2) We had a package that included breakfast. The good things were that this includes room service (particularly nice since we had the baby), and the food is really good. What was disappointing was that the ""included breakfast"" was a little strict. It's an $82 credit, which sounds reasonable until you realize that breakfast can easily be $125 (prices are very high). I feel that ""breakfast included"" should mean coffee, juice, a drink (like bottle water), and hot/cold food options with sides. I forget what exactly put it over the edge, but that kind of standard breakfast went over the $82 limit so that we ended up paying extra each time.    Other than these two critiques, we found it to be an appropriately luxurious and lovely property with the kind of service (apart from the above) and meticulous attention to detail that you expect in this class. The gym and spa is great, and the pools are beautiful. We were particularly pleased that they addressed me and my husband by our proper names (I kept my name, but tend to make the reservations, so my husband usually tolerates getting called Mr. myname -- but the Four Seasons always addressed him correctly.) They also did a lot of adorable things to greet our daughter (little gifts etc.), as well as provided the crib etc. we requested. We would definitely stay there again -- we went on to stay at the St. Regis in Princeville, Kauai (which felt like a conference hotel) and greatly preferred the Four Seasons. We wish we'd stayed there longer.",Jun 2012,May 2012,Traveled with family,Don't dismiss the golf ocean view rooms -- they are less expensive and still lovely.,"New York City, New York"

Everything about our stay was perfect. The location is picturesque and the grounds couldn't have been kept up better. Our room overlooked the kings pond and had an outdoor shower. I would come back just to use the outdoor shower.    The food at all 3 restaurants on the property were great (ahi burger was phenomenal) and all 5 separate pools were awesome. Spa and health club is world class.    The quality of service and the staff was the most impressive aspect of the resort. From being greeted by my last name throughout our stay, the 3 separate complimentary bottles of champagne and desert to celebrate our honeymoon, the cold towels and ice water that was provided every 30 minutes poolside, and the friendly and helpful attitude of all employees was just so impressive...you really feel special staying here.    The rooms are pricey but I never felt like I was being nickled and dimed for all the amenities that were provided for free ( internet, health club, snorkel gear, etc) and it was absolutely worth the cost and I look forward to some day coming back.",Jun 2012,May 2012,Traveled as a couple,,"San Francisco, California"

I cannot think of a single negative thing to say! We loved our room, most especially the outdoor shower. Who knew what a delightful experience an outdoor shower could be! The various pools were wonderful (petting a ray was cool, even for a 55 year old lady.) The beach was beautiful (the turtles were an added treat.)

130951536,50,Ultimate Island Resort,"Being regular guests at the Four Seasons Wailea, we hesitated to try Hualalai however now that we have our biggest dilemma is how to make it to both properties every year. Neither one is better - they are both fabulous and different. Hualalaiis secluded and has extreme natural beauty. You see the ocean from every vantage point and when sitting by the pool or the beach you see nothing else - no other resorts (with the exception of Kona Village which is closed right now but blends into the scenery like no other).  The rooms - each building is two story and I can't imagine that the lower floors don't have an ocean view. Virtually every building we saw seemed to have some sort of wonderful view so I don't think you can go wrong location wise. We were at the King's Pond which overlooked the Pond and the ocean. It was quiet and very peaceful. The King's Pond is a fully stocked snorkeling pond (the water is fresh water from the ocean that circulates from nautral volcanic channels underneath) and it is only open from 10 am to 4 pm so it's very quiet most of the day. The rooms were beautiful, yet understated.  The property - at first it's a bit overwhelming to get your bearings because the property is a bit spread out but once you get your orientation it's actually quite easy to get around. All aspects of the property are impeccable. The landscaping crew takes great care in attending to all the specimens of Hawaiian landscape and the pools as well as the beach and walkways are perfectly clean and kept in the highest condition.  The beach - the only aspect of staying here you need to be aware of is this - sitting and relaxing on the beach is the most peaceful I have ever experienced. The turtles are literally everywhere - be careful you might trip on one which we loved! The sand is great and the water is beautiful. However because of the natural elements (the reef and the spiny urchins) you are not going to be boogey boarding or swimming much at this spot. They have an area of the ocean that has a nautral reef break that they comb every morning for urchins that is swimmable. If you want to be more active in the water then you have to go by car to another beach but for us it didn't matter.  The restaurants - the food was amazing. Especially Pau'i restaurant. The Opah was unreal and we went back two nights in a row to have it again.  Overall - I would not hesitate to recommend this resort to anyone - with kids between 0 and 7 years it's great - the kids' pool is wonderful. My kids are between 9 and 13 years and they might not like not having the active beach experience but in a perfect world we would spend some time in Wailea first then come here and chill.

130905775,50,So close to nature,"For our anniversary, we chose this hotel primarily because of the great name that is synonymous with Four Seasons, but also because the Big Island is one less frequented by the Mass tourist group. It was seriously a gem and exceeded all my preconceived ideas from the minute we arrived. The setting is just spectacular - after driving 20 minutes from the airport being surrounded by nothing but black lava fields, you enter into an oasis of tree lined roads and lush vegetation. The staff made us feel as though we had arrived home. The rooms - wonderfully spaced with all the amenities you could image. The staff had given us a wonderful room right on the beach.  The turtles came right up onto the beach at night, dolphins swam in the breakers....

130709496,50,Gorgeous views with a five star experience,"We stayed at the Four Seasons for 4 nights in late May and loved it. We had an ocean prime room with a great view and excellent proximity to resort amenities. Staff is amazing and are ready to go above and beyond at any time. At first, the constant attention was disconcerting but by the end, I decided I could definitely get used to it! Ha! Our room was a group rate at a whopping $1,000 a night pre-tax... Not sure the room itself justified the cost (it was nice, yes, but no nicer than a Ritz at $500 a night). However the pools, spa, bars, etc. were definitely a cut above any other place I've ever stayed. The snorkel pool has 4000 fish and no waves- if you've got kids, take them here rather than paying for a snorkel trip! We ate multiple large group catered meals (buffet and plated) and none were very good- standard hotel fare of chewy chicken and veggies. However, I had a meal poolside that was amazing! Don't skip the onion rings!    A note on kids - there were several families there when we were- many with nannies in tow. The staff told me that after Memorial Day it becomes kid central with lots and lots of kiddos.

Our kids loved the KFAS, an amazing kids program with a valuable educational side to it. Many people have noted or complained how expensive this resort is, but having stayed both at Mauna Kea and Fairmont for not that much less, I can honestly say you get so much more at Hualalai for the small difference in price. Each minute of our vacations at Hualalai have been magical, inspiring and unforgettable. You can't say its too high a price tag when coming this close to paradise.

129699653,20,Hit and Miss,"I stayed at the Four Seasons Hualalai for 3 nights in April 2012. I stayed here as part of a 2 week Hawaii vacation to celebrate a honeymoon and 2 birthdays. We arrived just before 1pm. We were met with excellent service from the valet, who took our bags and our rental car. The grounds driving in were beautiful and the lobby was also very beautiful. Check-in is done on a couch in the lobby while you are provided a cold towel, and a refreshing drink from a coconut like shell cup. Perfect!    But this is where things started to turn south. We had reserved a prime ocean view room with a king bed. (From reading trip advisor reviews, the noisy upstairs neighbors scared me from a first floor room, despite the outdoor showers.) Just after signing a paper on an early departure penalty (we already paid 2 nights deposit), we were told that we would be in a room with 2 double beds. We refused. After checking, we were then offered an ""upgrade,"" which was wonderful until we scoped out the location. First floor, opening into a kiddie pool with a view of the back of the Surf Shack. The man checking us in informed us that the people who were given that room were not happy with it, after he had offered the same room to us! After we refused that room, the assistant manager, Paula got involved. Just after 3pm, she came to us and told us she had to switch 10 rooms around to get us the room we requested. During this, and a subsequent phone conversation with Paula, she said they don't guarantee rooms preferences and they do split up married couples into double beds. I read my confirmation email to her which said ""The following is guaranteed by credit card. Prime Ocean View room with one king bed 2 adults."" She said that is not their policy. If we had not already paid 2 nights deposit and signed the paper for an early departure penalty, we would have left, but they know how to limit your options. Paula said she would start off by comping our $60 lunch (2 drinks and a shared pizza)and do ""some research"" on what happened and would ""make this right."" I NEVER heard from her again. Tired from jet lag and frustrating check-in, I thought a nice bath with the fancy bath salts they provide would relax me. But no, the bathroom window looks onto an open convention room and lawn which had screaming kids, a steady stream of people by my window, and live amplified Hawaiian music. Not the experience I thought I would have at my first stay at a Four Seasons. (As an aside, at 1:24pm my credit card was charged for our 3rd and final night--we didn't get our room until after 3pm and while waiting for our room we watched another party check into a room without incident and heard a woman grant 3 different late check outs to current guests. It was infuriating.)    Housekeeping: The bath salts I used on the first night were never replaced. The bathroom floors are dirty and will turn the bottoms of your feet black. One day we requested early housekeeping (8:30-11:30) both on paper (they leave a paper on your bed to choose a time) and with a phone call--yet they began to clean our room at 1pm. Preferences are not met here with room choice or housekeeping.    Grounds: The grounds are beautiful, the pools are nice and varied in size and target audience (One is adult with a bar, one is geared toward kids.) The beach is blocked off from most waves by a rock barrier, but the beach is rocky and I recommend aqua socks for safety/comfort. King's pond is a fun place to snorkel with and eagle ray and tons of other kinds of fish. Complementary laundry facilities scattered throughout the grounds is also a very useful and appreciated feature. Turtles are all over the beach area and are fun to watch.    Rooms: Not a lot of privacy in the rooms, as you can easily see into each room from the pools, from pathways, and/or from other rooms . Nice sliding wooden shutters help with privacy, but impede the views of the ocean. Also, the noise from neighbors, dragging heavy patio furniture on their balconies is inescapable.    Staff: Aside from housekeeping and check-in, the staff are all superb. The staff at the pools, the beach, and restaurants are wonderful. The staff of the Beach Tree restaurant were the best of all and after a disappointing food at Pahu i'a, we ate every other meal there. The valet attendants were very nice, attentive and professional. The concierge was very helpful with directions, maps, and restaurant suggestions on a day trip to the volcano.    Summary: Four Seasons Hualalai is a beautiful hotel. Aside from check in and housekeeping, you will find wonderful, attentive staff who go above and beyond to make your stay enjoyable. We spent 3 nights and over $4000 there, and it simply was not worth it. This hotel was one of 3 that we stayed at for our honeymoon/birthday vacation and was to be the crown jewel with the best ratings of the three. Perhaps it can to be blamed on just a bit of misfortune and not meeting expectations, but this hotel was a distant 3rd to the Sheraton Maui and the Mauna Kea Beach Hotel.",May 2012,April 2012,Traveled as a couple,"No matter what room you choose or what email confirmation you have, the assistant manager will...","New York City, New York"

As far as everything goes, I can't really find any faults during my stay. Cheaper price would be nice but since when was the last time Four Seasons is cheap?? LOL. The reception area was gracious as usual like all other Four Seasons properties that I've been to. They had someone to take me and bf to our room via a golf cart. We stayed at the King's pond on the ground level. If you stay on the ground level, you get an outdoor lava shower. If you stay on the upper level, you get a better view of the ocean. Our room had the pond and a somewhat obstructed ocean view. The outdoor lava shower was worth the obstruction. I took shower out there daily. I mean how often do I get to take an outdoor shower??? King's pond is Four Season's scuba pond. There are tons of fish in the pond and one sting ray. It was nice except water is colder than the ocean when I was there. The food is very expensive on the premise but the quality is very high and I had the best chicken sandwich I ever had for lunch. It was juicy and tender. Usually chicken is dry and restaurants slap on the mayonnaise to cover that. Not the one at this Four Seasons! The dinner buffet was just absolutely lovely. lobsters, crabs, sushi, etc. etc. Probably the best buffet I had in a hotel. The quality is very high. The breakfast buffet was equally as good. The pancake was super fluffy, large variety of freshly squeezed juices. I can just go on and on about the food at this resort. Again, not cheap but at least they deliver the goods. We also lounged at the main adult pool in the middle. The staff were just lovely and they come and spritz you with Evian water. I felt very pampered. Without a doubt, I would go back in a heartbeat.

128660660,50,spectacular,"My husband and I traveled to the Four Seasons Hualalai September 2011 as part of an incentive program through his company and 7 months later I am still dreaming of returning. We have stayed in some very nice 4 and 5 star hotels in the past but this one topped the charts! And I am extremely hard to impress! I fell so in love with this place I still read the reviews, when researching other destinations, just to read about the experiences of others. Upon reading some of the most recent comments I felt compelled to write my own review because I feel that some clarification is needed. Some comments regarding this hotel state that it is very remote. I would like to clarify that it is definitely secluded but by no means is it remote. I found this to be one of the most awesome things about the hotel. When turning off the main road back to the Hualalai resort it is very exclusive. A beautiful drive. Our first night there we just could not wait to see what was at the end of this road and it certainly did not disappoint. It is most definitely expensive and fortunately for us we were not footing the entire bill. We did eat at the hotel most of the time and this was mostly at our expense, so we still left with a pretty hefty bill at the end of the week even though we did not pay for the room. However, we knew going into it that it would be expensive and so we planned for it. We felt the food was wonderful. Yes the hot dog was $18, but I have to say that when they brought it to my husband it looked so delicious that I wished I had ordered it! Our breakfast every morning was close to $90 for 2 meals and mimosas. Ridiculous I know, but if you could have seen our view from our table you wouldn't think twice about the bill. We chose to eat off property a few evenings and it is not that far of a drive. About 25 minutes into Kona but honestly we didn't find anything great there. 20 minutes the other direction is a nice outdoor mall with many restaurants. The spa was incredible! I received 2 spa treatments that were absolutely amazing! You have full access to the amenities of the spa throughout your stay. This was especially appreciated on our last day there since our flight was not until 9 PM and our bags were being held until we left. Everything is provided for you, shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, even shaving cream and razors. This made our day of leaving so much less hectic than some of other vacations where you have to check out but keep a bag with your toiletries. We were fortunate enough to have a first floor room which had an outdoor lava rock shower, simply spectacular! The room is quite large with sliding doors that open completely so that you can fall asleep to the crashing waves. I loved our room but I do believe they all face the ocean so I can't imagine that you could go wrong. We have been thinking of visiting the Four Seasons Maui but after this vacation I believe I will return here as soon as possible, if only for the shower alone! The lay out of the resort is awesome. It is very spread out and a bit of a walk to get to various locations from our room, but this was all part of the beauty. The hotel has several beauiful pools but unbelievably we did not spend time at any of them. We spent every day at the beach in the most amazingly comfortable chaise lounge ever. We never had trouble finding our spot each day as the hotel did not seem overly crowded but most people seem to spend their time at the pool. They still bring all of the same luxuries to the beach as if you were poolside: lunch/drink menu, frozen popsicles, cold towels, evian spritzes... Even sunscreen is provided in the pool area which was a very convenient bonus. We loved watching the sea turtles every day come up to the shore and feed off the lava. The beach is definitely not swimmable except for the area that is sectioned off but this was no big deal to us. My husband and I honeymooned in Maui 12 years ago and have been wanting to return to Hawaii. I am embarrassed to say that the Big Island was never at the top of my list of islands to visit but now having been there I CANNOT WAIT to return, even if we foot the bill. I will save for as long as it take! It was incredible!",Apr 2012,September 2011,Traveled as a couple,,"Cincinnati, Ohio"
128493864,50,You Pay for Excellence,"I was hesitant to give the full five stars primarily due to the cost of this place alone. I understand paying a premium for a premium location and premium service but this place just about crosses the line or being reasonable. I was here with a group and had a hefty discount on the room ( just over $500 per night instead of just over $700 per night), but is $500 a night for a room a bit too much? This did not even include maid service...that was an extra $6 a day tacked on to the room. We also got a $30+ charge added to the room for Porterage but I carried my own bags to my room. In addition, don't forget the almost $70 a day in taxes....where does it stop. One other, the resort is remote so you can pay a hefty sum to eat on property ($8 to $18 for a drink for example) or you can pay $100 round trip for a taxi into Kona...your choice.  The resort is amazing...the beauty far exceeds most places I have ever been and the service is unbelievable ( do you need your sunglasses cleaned while laying on beach chairs, or do you need a cold, fresh scented hand towel to wipe your face while on the beach). This place has all of that but you will pay for every luxury you take advantage of during your stay, in one way or another.  I was not lucky enough to get one of the outside shower rooms, but they are available and I hear are really nice. All of the rooms are very nice and all of them have ocean views..that is a positive if you enjoy watching the sunset or listening to the waves crash right from you room or balcony. The in room soaps, shampoos, and lotions are top of the line and I never had to ask for additional as they were stocked daily and refreshed during turn down every night. Towels are plush and plentiful and the shower stall is HUGE, full slate. The tub is spacious as well with bath salts provided and a wand to wash everything off when you finish.  The grounds are manicured to perfection and you will never pass a hotel worker without them saying Aloha. You will enjoy being treated like a king or queen duri g your stay but dont expect to have anything left in your wallet when you leave.  I loved the place but I know I could have had just as good of a time elsewhere for a whole lot less...maybe I am just cheap that way?",Apr 2012,April 2012,Traveled on business,All have ocean views but some are closer tha others...ask for one closer and one with an outside...,"Tampa, Florida"
128476982,50,Spring Break,"We left the Grand Wailea after 5 days to spend 5 days at this great resort. This was our third visit, and first in 6 years. Our sons 12& 9 loved their time here. They wish they had spent the entire spring break at this resort. Maybe the could mow a few hundred lawns to help with the bill next time.  A few cleanliness items were reminders of the former occupants of the room. The fridge was very noisey and required a service call.  The kings pond, tennis, golf programs were all well designed for children of all ages. We loved the walk to the beach tree for breakfast every morning",Apr 2012,March 2012,,,"Rosemont, Illinois"
128413265,50,The Hawaii that you dream of & yearn for.,"We have been guests at this property for years & it is one of our favorites. It is quiet, secluded and lush. The beach is adequate, and sometimes we will drive to nearby Hapuna beach for boggie boarding. We love the on site complimentary snorkeling at Kings Pond & the plethora of cabanas.  The food here has declined over the past 5 years, but it is still good. Our favorite place to eat lunch & dinner would be the Residents Club at past the 2 adult pool. It is gorgeous, the food is far superior and the location is spectacular.  The staff at most Four Season resorts are above par & the staff here anticipate your needs & often, exceed expectations.  The rooms are nice & some offer spectacular views- the 2nd floor rooms near kings pond offer great views & tranquility & even whale watching during the season. The first floor rooms are pretty & come with an additional private outdoor shower... The upper rooms are just sunnier to me.  There is a reason stars love this resort- privacy, solitude and service.",Apr 2012,April 2012,,,western US
128239561,50,Something very special about Four Seasons Hotels. They always do everything right!,"This is my third stay at a Four Seasons Resort since February. I now know why we always choose this hotel brand first. We were there during the very busy spring break period and after remarking to the hotel management that we were disappointed with our ability to get reservations for restaurants etc. they could not have been more apologetic and willing to make amends. Everyone from Florian Riedel, the Resort Manager to Casey one of the evening managers made us feel very special and offered us a credit toward our meals as well as other amenities. Our golf package worked out great and we met one of the nicest and most accomodating people we have ever met on a vacation, Brown Bear. This was our third time back to this resort and we will surely return. We have also stayed at the Fairmont Orchid several times but the Four Seasons is just a whole other level of service.",Apr 2012,April 2012,Traveled as a couple,,"Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey"
128147884,50,A Spectacular Property and Hotel,"This is a fantastic property. We have stayed at numerous Four Season Hotel properties around the world, both resort and city centre locations, and this is among our favourites (along with Costa Rica, Florence and HK). Be forewarned, this is a very expensive resort but worth every penny!    Let's start with the property: it is large, varied and an extremely beautiful. The beach is gorgeous, with lots of sand and lava formations and plenty of loungers in a variety of spots along the beach. Unfortunately, you can't swim immediately in front of the hotel (except for a decent sized swimming area carved out of the lava) but there is a nice place to swim about 300 meters north of the hotel along the beach. You will also find good snorkelling there: with decent coral starting about 200 meters off shore and extending about another 300 meters or so. The water is turquoise and clear, and we saw turtles, an octopus and lots of different fish.    There is are six pools (4 regular pools, plus a swimming pond and a protected ocean swimming area). The Beach Tree pool is large and has lots of loungers and shaded cabanas. The food here was not very good. The Palm Grove Pool is small and is reserved for adults only. There aren't a lot of loungers here so you need to be there quite early to get one. The Kings Pond is stocked with 4,000 fish, including a eagle wray, and is a fantastic place to get young children their first start at snorkelling. We found the food here fairly good.    Our room (Golf-view Suite) was large and very comfortable. Having two bathrooms meant that our 12-year old daughter could have her own space. An excellent fruit plate was there when we arrived and was restocked daily. This was a nice touch. Water bottles were resupplied daily as well. The fridge is un-stocked so there is room to store your own beer, soft drinks, milk, etc. We were staying at the resort for 10 days and it was nice to have an informal breakfast in the room rather than having to have the full buffet breakfast. Two complaints though: The bed provided for my daughter was a poorly design futon (with an uncomfortable fold in the middle). If they put this in your room, demand something better. The second complaint was the air conditioning. It worked well and was quiet but it was hard to keep the room at a constant temperature through the night.    The restaurants are good but not great. Sadly, this is typical of most FS resort properties. The high-end restaurant is Pahula, which also serves the breakfast buffet each day. We had dinner there twice. It was ok but not outstanding. Both Beach Tree and the Hualalai Grill serve more moderately price fare and we had good meals there. In our view, the best quality/value combination is the Resident's Beach House, which is available on a first-come, first-serve basis for lunch and reservations for dinner can only be made after 3:00 pm.    During much of our stay a ""pop-up"" restaurant took over the Hualalai Grill. It was called Ludo Bites, run by Chef Lefebvre. It was fantastic and we feel lucky that we were able to go there two nights. Hopefully this (and other) Four Season Hotels (especially the resort properties will try this more often as it was definitely a highlight of our stay.    We stayed at the hotel during Spring Break and, as a result, it was quite busy, although not oppressively so (unlike the Maui FS, which is horrible during busy periods, unless you have your nanny in tow and don't mind sending her down to the pool at 4:00 am to reserve a spot.) Advanced restaurant reservations during busy periods are a must. As long as we were to the pool before 10:00 am, we were able to get a lounger.    Other comments:    1. The hotel is quite isolated. If you are staying more than a few days, you will definitely want to rent a car, especially if you are wanting to see some of the attractions around the island. Parking is free unless you choose to have it valet parked. The parking lot is very close by. If you are staying in one of the golf view suites (looking onto the 18th hole) there is parking right outside your door. We found this very convenient.    2. There are no off-site restaurants close to the hotel. To eat away from the property, you will need to drive about 30 minutes.    3. Laundry facilities are available throughout the property. They offer high quality washing machines and dryers, and detergent and fabric softeners are provided. This is a nice touch.    4. Basic internet is free. This is for one device per room and offers decent speed for e-mail and the web. Connectivity was good. A premium internet package is available (higher speeds and three devices) for about $20 per day.    5. If you are wanting to do something different, look into the Wild Hawaii Ocean Adventure (WHOA). This is a high-speed, former Navy Seal Boat, that cruises about 40 mph and will take you snorkelling to areas other boats cannot reach. The owners (Brett and Deron) are great guys (former professional free divers) and their knowledge of the area is fantastic. While not cheap, this is one of the most unique and entertaining activities that we have done.",Apr 2012,March 2012,Traveled with family,,West Vancouver

127801576,50,Gorgeous resort with the best service on earth!,"We stayed with our family in two rooms during the first week of April. Our rooms were absolutely perfect- first floor on the kids pool crescent. They were set back in the far north corner with a view over the shark pond and to the ocean- beautiful and quiet! Everything in the room was perfect and the housekeeping was impeccable.  The resort staff are simply the best you will find anywhere. We have stayed in many 5 star resorts- but have never experienced such gracious, sincere and knowledgeable service. From the breakfast staff, to the pool staff and especially the incredible concierge staff-all went above and beyond.  The resort itself was very busy as it was spring break- but it wasn't oppressively so. We had just come from a week at the Grand Wailea in Maui where the crowds were horrible.(If you didn't wake up by 6:00 am, you didn't sit by the pool and you were lucky to get a chair in the back row of the beach- never again!)  We especially enjoyed the natural landscape and rustic coastline. The walk along the ""lava path"" at sunset was magical.

127745122,40,The hotel was nice but very expensive,"I had read the reviews of this Four Seasons for two years before deciding to book our trip. I have stayed at Four Seasons hotels before in different countries. My family has traveled to many countries and have always stayed at 5 star hotels. I have throughly thought out what I want to say. While the resort is nice I personally was not that impressed. We were a party of four. The hotel rooms are 1 bedroom with 1 king bed @ $2,500 per night. I decided to take a tip from tripadvisor and rent a villa. The villa was fabulous. It cost $1,200 per night. It had a kitchen so we could cook our own meals since our first lunch for 4 costs $178.00. Here are a few things to remember: we were charged $45 per person, per day just for being on the property. It was called a daily resort fee. Total for 5 days=$937.50. This resort is in a remote area-15 miles from downtown. Normally I do not rent a car while on vacation. We took a taxi to get groceries and round trip was $184.00. We rented a car. I forgot to bring body lotion so I went to the store on site- Cheapest body lotion costs $25.00. Our family is considered well off but not Bill Gates or movie star rich.

The landscaping was beautiful which made walking around the resort very nice. The tiki torches at night gives a very romantic feel when walking around.    Service: Excellent! All the staff we encountered were pleasant and very helpful. Our wedding coordinator Shea Cochran and her assistant Sara Kam were great handling all the details of our wedding.

Of course any trip to a Four Seasons will change you for life because no place will ever measure up again. We had a beautiful room overlooking the infinity pool and the ocean.

126303609,50,Worth every penny,"I am very fortunate to have stayed at Hualalai 5 times. It is expensive but there's no doubt in my mind it is worth every penny. I'm not one that spends money easily (and my husband will definitely agree with that). But this place.....it's hard to explain. Once you're there, it just feels right. It's the way the sun glints on the waves and lights up the spray in the wind. It's the way the buildings fade into the background so all you notice is the ocean, the lava and the trees. It's the sound of the waves lulling you to sleep, and the smell of the plumerias along the path. Even when it rains (which it has only once during our 5 stays), it somehow works. I took a shower in our outdoor shower while it was raining, and I looked up and saw stars in the sky around the clouds. Where else does that happen? And during supper at the Beach Tree Grill, a guitarist played while a beautiful girl danced the hula, and kids laughed and rolled around on the grass at their feet. It is ridiculously perfect. I will never regret a single penny spent there. Memories are important. Memories keep us going during cold Illinois winters. And I'm saving my pennies to go back with my husband to Hualalai and make more memories.",Mar 2012,September 2011,Traveled as a couple,,Illinois
126301730,50,Four Seasons Kona: Outstanding,"I love, love, love the Four Seasons...just about anywhere. Kona is no exception.    The property feels large (almost too large if you stay in the residences on the hill like I did), but the property just works. The food is amazing, the service A+, and the kiddie pool for families with a 2-3 year old is a life saver.    Bring your credit card -- but don't count, it will cost... BUT if you have the dough or focus on memories over experience and don't have to carry debt too long, this property is worth the investment.    I've been to a lot of Four Seasons properties. My favorite two are Kona and Punta Mita, with the edge going to Punta Mita (based on preferences in cuisine, etc) -- but Kona is outstanding and possibly better in its own right. Its just a matter of preferences really.    When you go to the beachside restaurant...ask for Chad to serve you and you'll see why. Chad gets it and is exceptional in the service area...well, most of the staff seem the same, problem is once any of them get to know you and call you by name, you don't really want to be taken care of by anyone else.    IF you're on the fence between this property and any of the others, do yourself a favor and just GO.

126007600,50,Quite possibly our favorite hotel experience ever!,"The room: We opted for the golf course/ocean view suite since the rate was a bit less than the full ocean view. The room was large with a living room, a large bedroom, a large master bath, and a second bathroom equipped with a steam shower which turned out to be one of the favorite features of the room. The living room and bedroom had large sliding glass doors that opened up onto a spacious patio with two seating areas, right next to the 18th green, with views of the ocean in the distance. Room was nice mix of modern and classical Hawaiian decor, and the bed was wonderful. If we went again, we'd opt for one of the pool side suites near the Traquility Pool since it's adults only, and was very quiet, and those rooms have closer views to the ocean.  Pros: Least crowded area of hotel complex, so lots of privacy and no noise from people at the pool. Cons: No mini-bar in room (odd for a 5-star property), and noisy landscaping of the golf course starts early. The resort is close to the airport, but far from Kona, so the one night we took a cab to get dinner offsite, it was $50 each way to get to the closest upscale offsite restaurant.  The service: Wonderful! The concierge got in touch with me within a day of making our reservation to help with dinner reservations, sightseeing recommendations, recreation, and rental car logistics. The hotel provided comfortable transport to and from the airport as a complimentary offering since we'd booked a suite. We complained about the landscaping noise and the Director of Rooms managed to get the golf course landscaping to start later in the mornings during our stay. The next morning, housekeeping started making noise in the room above us, and we complained again, and the Director offered to allow us to have a very late check out on our last day since we had a red-eye home, and that allowed us to use the pool and head back to our room to shower and pack before dinner. The bartending and service staff at the Tranquility Pool were incredibly personable, and their recommended mango gazpacho and mahi-mahi taco lunch was to die for.  The grounds: Beautiful! The hotel is laid out into several parts and all of the buildings are only 2 stories tall, so it's spread out along a long stretch of the beach rather than having everyone centrally located and on top of each other. Nice mixture of beautifully manicured landscapes, plus lots of natural ponds, tasteful tiki torches, an amphiteature, and wonderful jogging path through breathtaking lava rocks and crashing waves. The view from the Tranquility Pool to the grassy area where the hammocks and cabanas are nicely situated to the beach to the aquamarine waters is one of the most incredible views we've ever had for a vacation. We had plans to leave the resort to rent a car to check out the northern end of the island and to go snorkeling another day, and we just couldn't find it in ourselves to leave that beautiful pool.  The food: Top notch. We went off site two nights, and the only two meals we didn't love during our stay were off site. The Beach Tree bar and restaurant offer casual but fine dining very close to the beach and surf and the food's terrific. Bar service despite it being very busy at sunset is excellent and efficient. The Residents' Beach House at the south end of the property offers delicious cocktails and food for some of the prettiest sunsets we've ever seen in our lives. Our last night we had dinner a Pahu i' a, and the chef came out to greet us and check to make sure our delicious seafood meal was to our liking. Beautiful more dressy restaurant. We saw a couple and a family opt for the beach dining option which looked like a lot of fun (should be for $600/person!). Anyway, despite the slight annoyance with the landscaping and housekeeping noise, the fantastic service more than made up for the disturbance, and we hope to go back for a whole week or more the next time we visit Kona.",Mar 2012,February 2012,Traveled as a couple,,"Dallas, Texas"

Lush tropical landscaping & pool choices for everyone. My favorite, a giant aquarium to snorkel in. The property is set on a large amount of beachfront. The ocean walking paths contrast hotel landscaping with so much lava rock, never losing sight of the big island. I saw turtles sunning and whales out in the distance. Bring binoculars.    The spa is set in nature. My massage was done open air. I also used an outdoor treadmill & lap pool. Dry sauna, showers,and relaxation area are beautifully incorporated in the outdoors.    Our hawaiian styled room overlooked the 18th hole and beyond that the ocean. It was very attractive and service excellent.

The moment we stepped off the plane we were greeted by a Four Seasons representative to make sure we had a rental car and didn't need a ride. How's that for service?    Our room was at the top of the Kings Pond crescent- I would suggest this area if you want to hide from children. It seemed like Kings Pond was a lot quieter than the other areas of the resort. We had a first floor room with the outdoor lava rock shower which was a nice touch.    One unique feature of the resort is that it's only two stories high with direct access to the beach from most first floor rooms. The other hotels on the island did not seem to have the intimate feel that this property has since they are all 6 floors+.    We were frequent visitors at the Beach Tree bar - all hours of the day. It's the best place to watch the sunset. They have wonderful food and the service was excellent.    The Surf, Sand and Stars weekly beach bbq should not be missed!

It was perfect for us as we have slowed down a little and don't need water slides and too much action by the pool. If you love tropical elegance in a quiet and beautiful setting this is for you. The beach is mostly rocky and rough so water entry sports are limited. We were fortunate to be right on the tip of King's Pond crescent which looked like the closest unit to the beach in the entire complex and it was perfect. Outdoor shower and a big window that opened to the bathtub which allowed the wind to wash over you...dreamy. The Spa and workout area was extensive and well done. It also had a very nice lap pool. The series of four crescents allows for different settings each day to enjoy a little variety. Top notch Four Seasons style and service. However, we thought the restaurants were ok but not amazing. I had planned to swim with the fishies in King's Pond but I chickend out after reading that there was bacteria and you shouldn't go in with any open cuts.

Infinity edge glory and a swim up bar and 180 degree view of the ocean. Room selection is really critical--for example if you are with kids you will want to be closer to the main pool, particularly the downstairs rooms which open out onto a grass lanai area. We prefer downstairs, as you can get rooms with an impressively large outdoor copper shower.    The hotel gym and swimming complex is one of the nicest gyms I have seen and is not a typical ""hotel"" gym. All the equipment you will need for working out is here.    The nice thing about the Four Seasons is that they don't nickel and dime you, as they charge so much for the room to cover it. No charge for kid's club, free snorkel rentals, free cabanas, etc.    We thought the food was quite good, especially the breakfast buffet and dinner at the signature restaurant sitting next to the sand. Only knock is you do frequently encounter other guests who have serious attitude problems...(actual quote overheard from a guest when informed that the cabanas were full, ""Well, do you know who I am?""). We decided to laugh at those types and didn't let it annoy us too much.    One knock is that the beach is so-so, but there is a great State beach just one exit away, which is the prototypical Hawaiian beach--waves, crystal blue warm water and visibility to the bottom even 100 yards from shore.

We came the first time with our infant daughter and this time around we we wrangling a new baby and a feisty toddler. The hotel was wonderfully helpful given the logistical challenges that traveling with children presented. Our two connecting rooms were stocked with every imaginable type of baby item and the children's bathroom was cheerily decorated as well.    The rooms are not the most modern however they are spotless, beautifully maintained and quite functional. As our rooms were on the ground floor we were lucky enough to have outdoor lava showers which were an unexpected bonus. Although we found them lovely, they were an absolute hit with our 2.5 year old who found showering with the lizards delightful! Getting her to come inside often presented a challenge.    The grounds are breathtaking and the pools gorgeous. Our time was split between the family pool (the toddler pool is gorgeous and the perfect size for little people to wade around in) and the quiet pool (when our children were with the nanny). Although the we did visit the new Palm Grove pool we found it a little chilly (that said it is spectacular and the swim-up bar is a great touch).    The spa and the restaurants are top notch and although not inexpensive I think they do present value for money. Room service also offers a good variety and the children's menu is quite impressive compared to other hotel offerings we have seen.    When booking I would suggest talking to the hotel directly about your needs and they will do everything possible to accommodate them (I found better service ringing the resort than going through Global Reservations). Also, if you don't need to travel here during peak holiday times I would suggest you don't.

122625826,50,Amazing resort and so good to families,"We've stayed at the Maui Four Seasons a few times and found the experience so amazing, so we knew what to expect, but were still happily surprised by how good the service truly is. We went with our 5 year old son and 18 month old son. Throughout the trip, we did comparisons between the two properties on various subjects, so below is our comparisons:    Property: Winner is Hualalei. The property is absolutely gorgeous (plus because of the Tsunami, lots of remodeling had to be done, so alot was brand new when we were there). It's very lush and secluded at this property. All of the rooms are in 4 room mini condo-like buildings with high ceilings, floor to ceiling windows. Each building had a separate building attached with ice, free laundry machines (including detergent!). We got a standard room with a King bed and the room was gorgeous!!! More modern than the Maui ones. The room was quite large and had a pull out sofa and a giant bathroom with outdoor shower and a great patio where we had lunch every day. The hotel gave me a hard time about how this room was for 3 people only, but it was plenty of room for our family (plus we got a crib). At night it gets really dark and the property is lit by torches, so it was hard to get around. Plus all the buildings look the same, so we did get lost a few times :).    Location: Winner is Maui. The Hualalei is on it's own golf course and at the end of a private residences neighborhood. It's really secluded so if you don't ever want to leave the resort, this is the place to be. With the kids and the price of the food, we left the resort almost every day and everything is about a 15-20 minute drive (N or S) with nothing in between. So Maui to us to better since the location is so close to other restaurants, sightseeing.    Pool/Beach. Tie. The pools at the Hualalei are spectacular. There's even a pond where you can snorkel (for free) and feed eaglerays. The family pool (where we spent 100% of our time) was fantastic and the kiddie pool was sandbottomed and full of toys and mini lounge chairs. The only con to the kiddie pool was that it wasn't connected to the family pool so we had to hang out only at the kiddie pool or the family pool. The Maui pools are connected so you didn't have to move to new lounge chairs/cabanas or you could hang out in the larger pool while your kids were in the kiddie pool. The cabanas were free at both properties and they came around with free treats (fruit, otter pops, ice cream). The Maui treats were better as they were different all the time (mini muffins too!). The adult pool looked amazing. The swimming beach area was lagooned off, so the water was clear and calm and so safe for the kids to swim in. It was also right next to the pool so it was easy to go back and forth. My husband missed the waves of Maui though and the softer sand.    Food: Tie. We didn't eat at the restaurants that much due to the price, but kids 4 and under eat for free. The beachtree grill was delicious for dinner and the breakfast buffets at both the properties are amazing. My husband does like the Maui breakfast buffet better though. He thinks there is more of a selection. The views from all the restaurants are amazing at the Hualalei.    Service: Maui property. Though we say the Maui property, the service is pretty much over the top and spectacular at both places. I think the only reason we give an edge to the Maui property is because the Maui employees made it seem more like they were old pals with us so it was a little more casual, but excellent service. Hualalei did everything we asked for plus a little extra so we felt a little guilty asking for anything, but they seemed more stiff. For instance, at the pools, whenever we went to dry off, we would get brand new towels. I'm sure most people thought this was great, but we felt it was wasteful (especially when you're in and out every 20 min with kids). One girl also apologized to me for not remembering my name from the day before when I only ordered 1 drink for her - very sweet, but made me feel bad.    Random Cons: Way more expensive than Maui (food and rooms). A regular room at the Hualalei was about the same as a 1 bedroom executive suite in Maui. They gave us blocks of time for when our room could be cleaned, but it was never done by the time we went back. We thought it was weird that the hambuger on the family pool menu was more expensive than the exact same hamburger at the regular pool menu.    Overall, a wonderful experience and I would definitely go back. I love the Four Seasons Resorts!!",Jan 2012,October 2011,Traveled with family,,Seattle

It's so quiet at night you can sleep with the door open without the fear of noises from the next room or from the pool activities, or from kids running around (although it's family oriented and thus has excellent facilities for them without disturbing the adults, like a small swimming pool with sand). We would totally return to this four seasons. The only recommendation: the swimming pools are really TOO cold! Please heat them to at least 30C or 32C, because it's not enjoyable, in the other hand the whirlpools where all the kids go because they freeze are TOO hot. They should be no more than 36-37C being that many kids and infants go inside. For the adult one you can keep it high but please regulate the temps so both are comfortable.",Jan 2012,December 2011,Traveled with family,With a garden access is a must!,"New York City, New York"
122497486,50,"Mostly pros, a couple cons, overall amazing","Stayed the week before Christmas.  Mostly Pros: The food was outstanding and I wish more HI resorts offered this quality of food. The bummer is that we could not get reservations either night of our stay at the onsite restaurants and no one warned us about this when making the reservation. You'd think they would know this way ahead of time??!!?? The good news is that the ""sports bar"" was wide open and if you sit on the balcony you can barely hear the TVs and the food was excellent...for a sports bar (don't try to custom order a drink...pick the ones they have perfected).  Kids club is great! Daughter likes the Orchid's better for the off site activities but this one was free...  Kings pond was amazing: go right at 10am when they feed the fish so you are literally snorkeling with thousands of hungry fish! The eagle ray was fun to try and spot.  Baby pool was really well done (we don't have a baby but I could see this as a huge draw).  Husband still talks about the roaming fruit kabobs and guy who cleans everyone's sunglasses while you are lounging at the pool. Very well done!    Minor cons: Forgotten newspaper, flooded lava rock shower, seashell waiter forgot spicy stuff on side, lack of organized nightly activites in that great amphitheater or nightly music somewhere. Need updated organized activities (music, crafts, night activity). They also had listed as an advertised activity a garden tour, but when we asked to schedule this they said they had stopped it over 6 months ago.  These are really minor issues for the outstanding service and quality of resort this is.  So glad they were able to recover so quickly after the Tsunami damage. Great job on the pools!  We definitely look forward to staying here again!",Jan 2012,December 2011,Traveled with family,,"Portola Valley, CA"

Normally after a week in Hawaii, we are getting bored and ready to move on, but this hotel made us want to stay much longer.

122147413,50,"Stand aside Walt, you have been upstaged","The annual december trek to the Hualalai Four Seasons has become the high point of the year for myself and my wife for eight years now. Amazingly, each year we return to this property, it just gets better and better. Sorry Walt, but this truly is the happiest place on earth.    The scene for a fabulous week is set with the gracious welcome at the reception area and the exceptional bell service at check in. This unparalleled level of attentive and congenial service is not the exception but the benchmark for our entire stay and has remained so for every trip to this property.    The renovations following the tsunami are wonderful, especially the addition of the palm grove pool which is now the adult-only quiet pool. Stand aside beach tree pool, you are now upstaged and have been relegated as a ""kid-friendly"" location. The palm grove pool swim-up bar is a great addition with its own specialty drinks and fresh herb garden behind the bar to add that extra flavor to the superlative libations. Pool service and the ambience here is also more akin to the glory days at the beach tree. The beachfront landscaping has also been tweaked, resulting in much more attractive grounds. The residents beach restaurant has also been renovated with markedly improved beach views and new more attractive deck construction. All in all, significant improvements to an already over-the-top location.    The only issue with this trip was my final hotel bill did not subtract the one free night included with my stay. I did not notice this at checkout, but the error was corrected with one phone call.    The on site restaurants, Beach Tree and Pahuia, also continue to evolve into even higher quality although very expensive culinary experiences. Beach Tree continues to be our favorite with spectacular pizzas and very tasty and inventive sandwich creations for lunch. The wild boar nachos are a must try item. Dinner is also a relaxed experience with even more pasta, locally raised beef and fresh fish items. My personal favorite is the osso buco lasagna. I especially appreciate the wine list which is organized into 3 groups of red and white wines priced at 40, 60 and $80 per bottle. This simplifies and economizes the wine selection process. I was also very pleased by the reorganization of the Pahuia menu which has been simplified but at the same time diversified. Try the lobster in curry sauce and you will know what I mean......an enchanting multilayered but delicate curry sauce like no other I have experienced. Also a tip that we have learned over the years. If ordering room service, you can order from the beach tree or pahuia menu which significantly improves the in suite dining experience.    Lastly, I cannot emphasize enough the excellent and friendly service provided by the hotel staff at all levels. By far, despite the idyllic location and ultimate relaxation, the level of service and positive attitude of all of the staff will ensure my annual return to hualalai for decades to come.",Dec 2011,December 2011,Traveled as a couple,,"Reno, Nevada"
122054700,50,"Most refined, most variety","I've stayed at three of the Four Seasons resorts in Hawaii: Manele Bay on Lanai, Wailea on Maui, and now Hualalai on the Big Island. And I can say that I loved all three, but Hualalai is my favorite.    Hualalai is big but intimate. OK, what do a I mean by that.    The ""big"" is the spread out nature of it; there's just a lot of experiences here. Several pools, long coastal frontage with all kinds of interesting pools and surf, large spa, lots of tennis courts, and the golf right there weaved into the resort.    The ""intimate"" is that this is not some hulking large multilevel Hotel. No building is taller than 2 stories. All rooms are in crescents around some sort of pool or part of the golf course. Concrete massiveness is no where here. It's all paths and fantastic landscaping. There are many places where you can have a private moment, just you and your better half or just you and the elements. Usually the only sound I could hear at night was the ocean.    Food was great. Almost too great. I also enjoyed the settings. Breakfast practically on the beach, lunch at a grille perched above the golf course with wonderful backdrop of Mt Hualalai in the distance, or dinner on a terrace by the pool and ocean.    Downside? While Hualalai in my opinion has a far more interesting beach than is typical, its beach is not the kind that supplies opportunities to throw yourself into its waves. Too much volcanic rock, the same thing that makes it so much more beautiful and fun to explore. But to scratch that itch of a traditional wave playing experience, we drove our rental car up to Hapuna. That beach is just about is good as it gets in hawaii or anywhere frankly. And it's open to the public. It's about 30 min drive up the Kona coast (a striking drive BTW). In any case, I'd suggest at least one day where you get out and explore the Island -- and on that day drop into Hapuna with bodyboard.",Dec 2011,December 2011,Traveled with family,,Houston

Set on Kona's rocky coast, everything about this fine hotel will make you relax (except perhaps the prices). The rooms are beautiful, and the pool areas (especially the adult's only pool) are fantastic. The lap of luxury includes face spritzes of Evian as you sit by the pool, a personal sun glass cleaner who walks around and polishes your Ray Ban's, iced pineapple served as you relax in the pool.    Did not get a chance to play golf here, but the course looks pretty and challenging. Had an opportunity to visit the spa and the treatments were great (although they probably could have a bit bigger spa for the number of guests).    One caveat, you are somewhat in the middle of nowhere - save for the resort - so your dining options are somewhat limited and reservations are required for locations at the resort if there is any kind of crowd.

We had booked a ocean view room but did make a request prior to our arrival that if any comp upgrades were available we would like to be considered and noted we are repeat FS guests (Maui & Lanai). We were upgraded to an Ocean Front Suite......just amazing. We were in the Kings Pond section of the resort which was very quiet. You really do not have to lift a finger to do anything if you don't want to. From the bellman who brought us to the room (they use golf carts everywhere) to housekeeping for different pillows to the staff who are at the pools / beach area and restaurant staff, truly were all helpful and a delight. Housekeeping left a form when we arrived asking when we would like them to clean the room in the morning which was something I have never seen. We ate at all the restaurants, loved Beach Tree and the Hualalai Grill. The resort was not full -we never had anyone next to us on chairs by Kings Pond Beach area. The fitness center was great, plenty of treadmills, ellipiticals, weight machines. You usually do not see washing machines at a FS but this one had several washers/dryers through the resort which made life a little easier. You did not have to purchase detergent they make it available. There is also a gas pump at the Hualalai Trading Company and it was about 3 cents over the price per gallon at outside gas stations which are not near the resort, so this was good too. There is a path that fronts the resort/ beach and the resort has a map in the rooms showing the various jogging /walking trails.

121204427,50,Amazing Staff and Property.,"We spent 6 days (November 11th to 16th) at the Four Seasons Hualalai after a week at The Four Seasons Maui. This was by far our most memorable vacation, thanks to the amazing hotel staff.    This was our second visit to this hotel, and by far our best Hawaiian experience we’ve had in 5 trips. Our visit to FS Hualalai in April 2010 wasn’t without issues. We were staying at the hotel during a time they had several other corporate groups, and the hotel was busy, and the service wasn’t exactly perfect. This time around was completely different.    Check in was fast, warm and efficient. We were surprised and delighted to find out we had been upgraded to a suite! In the past we’ve been upgraded to a better room location, but never to suite. We had a golf/ocean view suite directly facing the 18th hole of the course. We couldn’t have been more impressed with the location/view/suite amenities, etc. The room had two bathrooms, and a steam shower. It’s certainly hard to go back to regular life with a room like this.    We had some initial issues with housekeeping (same problem with our last visit), but it was immediately rectified, and all future days were perfect. If you have any issues with room service, or anything else, just let someone know. They will always try and make it right.    The weather was perfect that week, and we really got to explore a bit more of the island on this trip. Usually we snorkel every day, and love every minute of it, but this time around we tried to include a few non-snorkelling activities. We visited Waimea and really loved the change of pace and quaintness of the town. And I enjoyed the fresh breeze and cooler temperature of Waimea.    We love the Big Island for so many reasons, but this trip (our third to Kona) really stole a part of my heart forever.    Some Pros of FS Hualalai:    1) Property: This is the most amazing hotel setting we have been to in Hawaii. It’s very secluded, and romantic. The landscaping is immaculate! Compared to the Four Seasons in Maui, this hotel is the true winner.    2) Restaurants: The Beach Tree restaurant is fabulous. We ate here for 5 nights and had the most amazing waiter (Chad) who made this a special trip for us. Tried several dishes and they were all very impressive. Make sure to make reservations, as this hotel gets very busy with hotel guests, residents and local people. The nightly musicians are really talented and the sunsets are by far the best in all of Hawaii. There should be a competition for best sunsets.    Breakfast buffet at Pahu i’a is just okay (it seems a little bit disorganized compared to Maui ) but the setting is really the best part. It’s nice to dine that close to the ocean; a great way to start the day. The waiters seem a bit over worked here, but that is only because Maui FS is much busier, with more staff. We had a really nice waiter named Jorge and the Manager Ricardo was exceptionally pleasant and accommodating. It’s the staff that create vacation memories at this hotel. Thanks!    3) Pools: The pools are all very unique and interesting. The service by the pool is good; the pool ladies are quite lovely!    4) Staff: The staff at this hotel really try hard to accommodate your every request and the service is generally excellent. If you want something, just ask. They rarely say no to any request. Even the groundskeepers (who never seem to sleep) are warm and friendly.    5) Amazing acts of service excellence: So under the category of they must be recording our car conversations …. I had commented to my husband in the car that the arm on my sunglasses was ready to come off, and did he have a mini screw-driver on his pocket knife. He did and said he would fix it later, but then quickly forgot. When we returned back to our room after dinner the same night, both our sunglasses had been cleaned, with FS cleaning clothes left as little gifts. And the arm on my sunglasses had been completely fixed. Are you kidding me? Did that just happen? I want to live at FS Hualalai for the rest of my life, if only I was a billionaire.    Some Cons (even the FS is not perfect):    1) On-site Snorkel Tour: Attempts at booking a snorkel tour with Alaka’i Nalu or Ocean Ambassadors was a situation that turned from bad to worse. We tried several weeks in advance, and then on arrival to book the ribcraft snorkel tour (advertised by the hotel in their glossy brochure). We kept getting different information from the hotel’s Concierge, but what was really frustrating was that we gave them 4 different days to choose from, and they still could not get us on any tour. First we were told they had private groups and then they didn’t have enough people to make the trip (translation: wouldn’t be profitable, so why go out). At one point we were confirmed, but then non-confirmed. After numerous emails, voicemail messages and direct calls with the Concierge (and later the General Manager at his request) we still don’t have a real reason. Saying that, I’m not sure I would ever give this company my business, and I’m glad we went out with Seaquest instead. They are extremely professional, albeit a less pretentious snorkel company, and seem to have that true Aloha spirit we expect when travelling to Hawaii. Check in was out of the back of their SUV, but that was to be expected since the tsunami did damage to their office. Our tour guide (Bill) was awesome, and we couldn’t have asked for a better day. We arranged this tour ourselves, for a lot less money.    2) Housekeeping: We had a few issues, but generally housekeeping can’t really be blamed. I saw the same women cleaning rooms early one morning, only to see her again at 6 pm. later that same night. They are certainly working hard, I just feel that if people are having issues with housekeeping, then the hotel needs to assign more staff to do the work.    On a positive note, we plan to return next year at the same time (right before US Thanksgiving) because this seemed to be a good time to travel, with less crowds, etc.",Nov 2011,November 2011,Traveled as a couple,,"Toronto, Ontario"
121178344,40,Almost-perfect,"The resort was perfect for what we wanted -- low-key luxury, low-rise setting, room with a combination of privacy and view. We got all of that. We had also hoped for great food, which was probably our biggest disappointment. The fine-dining restaurant was ok, and the best food we found was at the non-Four Seasons Residents' Beach Club.    Our room was at the King's Pond, which was a great place to snorkel and was lovely and peaceful to look out over. Unfortunately, they did not have any corrective lens snorkel masks available to borrow, so neither my husband or myself could see much underwater beyond colors and shapes darting around us. On the other hand, that was still wonderful!!    Because of a situation outside of the hotel's control, there were no rental cars available, so we were really stuck at the resort for the five nights. We started feeling a little cabin fever, but what a lovely cabin to be stuck in!    One of the best things about the resort was the service... everyone we met seemed to be genuinely welcoming and never in such a hurry that they couldn't stop to chat.    Another highlight was watching the sun set each night from the Beachcomber (?) Bar... it was surprisingly uncrowded most nights since we were slightly off-season, and the views were amazing. We ate dinner here one night, and the food was pretty good.

120753416,30,Do your homework,"I must say this is a very very nice resort. This was our 2nd stay at the property. We go on about 10 vacations with the kids a year and I do a lot of homework before hand to make sure that I am getting the best deal possible. I spent a couple of days looking at various days to go on this vacation, to get the most bang for the buck. I decided to go about 10 days before Thanksgiving as it appeared that all room categories were available. I called AMEX Platinum card fine hotels to book the trip to take advantage of the free room upgrade, comped breakfast and resort credit. When American Express called the hotel they told her that all that was available was a prime ocean view room. I insisted that I was looking on the four seasons website and it said the ocean/golf view room for $625/night was available, the lady at American Express said she saw it available also. Four Seasons told us that if we went with the ocean/golf view room, we would have to switch rooms mid trip and the only one that was available was with two double beds, not a king. They suggested that I go with the $900/night room to avoid all problems. While I was on hold, I brought up FS website on 4 different computers and was able to reserve at least 4 standard rooms with a king bed, no problem on their website. After going back and forth with the hotel for 1/2 hour, they found a ocean/golf view room with a king bed, but could not guarantee the room upgrade until we arrived. I told them I did not want to fly all the way out there to be told there were no upgrades available, when I can see all rooms available on their website. They told me they would call me back within 20 minutes. 2 hours later after not getting a call back, I called to tell them forget the whole thing as the trip does not seem that fun anymore. They then found the upgraded room. I was also told that kids 5 and under eat for free. When we arrived I was told it was under 5, not five and under. I was also promised a free night, after 5 nights I went to front desk to check my bill and noticed that there was no free night. The person at the front desk removed one of the nights and I checked out. End of story.........Nope, I get home and look at my American Express online and notice someone just charged me $700 for the free night after I all ready settled the bill at the front desk. No one called me to tell me they were charging my card. I just called the hotel to asked why they charged my card without calling me first, they said they would call me right back.................still waiting... by the way, the hotel was at 30% capacity.

120719632,50,Best resort in Hawaii,"My wife and I have visited four islands in Hawaii. Maui, Kauiai, Oahu and the Big Island, which is by far our favorite. Whenever possible while traveling, we stay at a Four Seasons Hotel. Without a doubt, we consider the Four Seasons Hualalai not only the best resort in all of Hawaii, but also at the top of the Four Seasons chain.  What sets the Hualalai apart from the others starts with the weather. Located on the Kaila-Kona coast, the weather is phenominal. The temperature rarely varies from 82 dregs.F and seems to never rain. Unlike the Hilo coast which can be depended upon to rain daily. At first glance, after leaving the airport ( which is in itself a travel treat ) the landscape looks like a desolate scene from the moon due to the thousands of acres of lava fields. This disappears as you enter the resort at Hualalai. With a stunning mixture of tropical foliage and indigenous lava as the main building material, this resort is different than every other resort we have seen on the Big Island. No high-rise buildings. Only two story bungalow type buildings. Every room feels like a suite with its own ocean view balcony or patio. The crowning feature however is the service. We feel like we are returning home each time we arrive, even though we only go every other year. The majority of the staff has been there for years and they always remember us.  There are several small restaurants on site, each with a different level of service and style of cuisine. One thing we find refreshing is the new addition of an adults only pool with swim up bar. Two other pools are available for family use as well as a man made salt water lagoon complete with tropical fish and even stingrays, known as Kings Pond. It is an awesome place to snorkel or feed a stingray.  There is no need to rent a car for a week since you'll rarely want to leave the resort. However, if you get tired of laying around on the beach, being spritzed with Evian water, just ask the concierge to reserve a car for the day.  In a coconut shell, The Four Seasons, Hualalai is probably one of the top resorts in the world and should be on every island lovers list of destinations.",Nov 2011,July 2011,Traveled on business,We always like a second (top floor) room since we normally arrive during whale season.

120601517,40,"Gorgeous Setting, Truly Memorable","My husband and I were fortunate to stay at the Four Seasons for our honeymoon. We stayed for 10 full days and had a wonderful time. The concierge did everything they could to help us with our requests. The setting was truly remarkable, world-class, immaculate. You name it! We are both avid golfers and enjoyed the Jack Nicklaus course (we had the golf package). The best drink-cart guy was Sid and he made sure we were well taken care of! He was always ready when he saw us for whatever drink we wanted. The dining experiences were great. The resort is very expensive, so those looking to save a few bucks should avoid this place at all costs. The other thing on our ""wish-list"" to spend the honeymoon was to have a proper beach where we could potentially surf on-site, however this place doesn't really offer that type of venue. We did go offsite for this and had a great time. We didn't see a lot of people swimming along the shore so it didn't appear to be a ""preferred"" beach-setting (i.e. nobody really went in the water along the resort). Many made up for this by snorkeling in ""Kings Pond"" a sea-pond with many types of fish and a king ray!",Nov 2011,November 2011,Traveled as a couple,,"Cedar Rapids, Iowa"
120549777,50,Excellent Resort,"My family stayed at the Four Seasons Hualalai from Oct 20 - Oct 30, 2011 for the first time. Every aspect of the stay was excellent. Although this resort is expensive, those who demand very high standards will not be disappointed. We stayed in a first floor ocean front room only steps from the ocean as well as the pool. Room was very nice (not as big as other resorts we have stayed in but very sufficient for a family). Outdoor shower was a very nice feature of our room (must request if you are interested as all rooms do not have them). The property has many swimming pools but we found the ""family"" pool with the infinity edge to be the best. Workout facility was excellent with all expected equipment in good order. Service was excellent. Every staff member, and I mean everyone, said hello/aloha as we passed them each day, many addressing my family by name (even some that we had not met). We had many special requests during our stay each was met with a smile and carried out as requested. Beach at this resort is very nice (large for Hawaii standards). The beach has a lava reef on either end which is great for exploring the marine life; we saw large turtles everyday of our stay. The beach is also protected by a lava breakwater so it is great for swimming around with only very small waves some of the time (suitable for small children). Beach and pool have full service, including staff that come by and clean your sunglasses off for you, popsicles, cold towels, etc... Restaurants are very good, I highly recommend the buffet (every kind of food that you cam imagine and the deserts, oh my..) that is held every Saturday night which includes live music and a professional telescope and astronomer so you can stargaze (quite neat and informational). I would especially recommend stopping by the Hawaiian cultural center on-site. It was very educational and they have scheduled activities like bracelet making for the kids, the passion that the associates of the cultural center have for Hawaiian culture is evident and very special. My family has visited all of the Hawaiian islands many times and stayed at all of the best resorts, and this resort ranks as our favorite.

119724229,40,"Nice, But Not Quite FS 'Perfection'","I’m placing our ‘helpful’ information first, our experiences are further down if you care to read that far.    We used Gold Coast Town Cars (booked via e-mail) for transportation from the Kona airport to the FS. It worked great and I would use them again. As we were here during the ironman triathlon championship there were no rental cars available. We hired a Gold Coast Lincoln town car (SUV also available) with driver to take us around – “anywhere you want to go as long as its legal”. It was perfect for myself, my wife and young son. Given the congestion in Kona from the event it was a great decision. At first, I was a bit grumpy about the $65/hour I knew it would cost. However, our driver (John?) was a great guide. It was money well spent and I’d do it again and ask for John. The concierge was happy to arrange a taxi back to the airport for us upon departure.    Especially for younger children, take advantage of the activities scheduled at the cultural center. They’re free, provide a nice break from pool/sun and you’ll have (easy-to-pack) hand-made souvenirs to take home.    Our preferred dining location became the Hualalai Grill, overlooking the golf course. It’s casual with good food and service. Donald will treat you right. Oddly, it’s closed on Tuesday and Wednesday. We ate there four times with no reservations and no wait. One evening the chef came out to say hello.    Play it safe, make reservations for dinner at Beach Tree or Pahu i’a. As at least one other reviewer noted, it’s a bit aggravating to walk up and ask for seating at 5:30 when the restaurant is open, full of empty tables, only to be told they’re fully booked (especially as a resort guest).    If you have children under five years of age you can still use the kid’s club although you’ll need to remain with your child. We visited daily with our three-year-old. He loved it (as on Maui). You’ll be just as welcome as everyone else.    My wife enjoyed several spa treatments. Go early and plan on staying after to enjoy the amenities of the spa. They complete the experience (according to my wife). I’m not going to argue that…    The fitness facilities are superior, I used them seven times during our ten night stay and it was a pleasure. My wife participated in a couple of the fitness classes, usually with a $15 fee. As skeptical as I was about the cost they seemed a good value. She was in a pi-yo (pilates/yoga) class as the only student and the scheduled 30-minute class went nearly an hour. I don’t think you get short-changed.    Get a copy of the published (weekly) activity schedule to assist in planning activities.    The manager’s reception on Thursday from 5-6 pm has good pu-pus and good drinks, alcoholic and virgin. The drinks flow generously but stop at 6 pm so don’t be late.    And now the review:    As mentioned above, we recently returned from a ten night stay at Hualalai.  We had immensely enjoyed a ten night stay at the FS Maui last year and wanted a similar experience at a different location.  Both our experience on Maui as well as the glowing reviews here had us expecting near-perfection. This was not the case. And, we had come directly from a satisfying three nights at the Outrigger Waikiki, certainly no FS, but no Motel-6 either.    Having considered how people perceive and review accommodations (including myself) I recognize that one’s prior experiences represent a context for your next experience and the comparison that ultimately follows. To be fair, in totality we enjoyed ourselves and the setting was very nice. There certainly were no major issues or problems and indeed several individuals stood out in our minds (Jay at the kid’s club and Donald at Hualalai Grill). Our ocean-view room was clean and comfortable and conveniently located. Food was generally good. The Surf/Sand/Stars dinner was good and I recommend it (go hungry). Sushi, cracked lobster claws and the best swordfish I’ve ever had were highlights for me. We were comp’d our drinks for our anniversary celebration - nice. The outdoor shower in our ground floor unit was fun and provided fuel for that romantic spark…..    However, we experienced numerous small but perplexing stumbles that should have never happened. I wrote a rather lengthy letter to FS factually documenting the issues we experienced, not so much to complain as to inquire how or why they happened. I also took the opportunity to compliment the two individuals noted above. Any one of these stumbles alone would be utterly forgettable. Collectively they became an annoyance and seemed to indicate a slip in service quality. I will not bore you with the details here as that would require another thousand or so words.    This is not a Hilton or Sheraton (no disrespect intended). This is the Four Seasons, a property that some consider the finest in the U.S. and one of the finest in the world. Details matter at this level. I would dare to say that FS management would agree. It is very tough to consistently meet such a standard but if you want to be number-one, that’s the price. I recognize that staffing this type of an operation with first-rate staff throughout is very challenging – particularly on an island. Perhaps our prior visit to Maui had brought our expectations to a new level. However, when one is paying an amount approaching one-thousand dollars a day for accommodation/food/beverage I believe high expectations are not unreasonable.    Two weeks of vacation time is precious to us and we try to plan it well. We’re not celebrities who expect the ‘best of everything’. We wanted to be wowed and to depart with a strong desire to return – I like being a satisfied customer! I believe we would return to the Maui property or try another FS location (Maldives?) before returning to Hualalai based upon this experience and price point. Thus, the four star rating.",Oct 2011,October 2011,Traveled with family,,Bremerton
119690708,50,Worth the Money,"With so many 5 star reviews on this hotel, how can you take any of them serious right? Well this hotel is worth the 5 stars. If you've never stayed at a Four Season's before you have to understand the justification for the high cost is in how you will be treated by their staff. This is not something you can see on the website. What impressed me most was that within moments of arriving every staff member knew our name, that we were on our honeymoon, and that we had lost our luggage in transit. The staff worked diligently over the course of two days to retrieve our bags. They even comped my wife a bathing suit from their boutique so that we could enjoy our honeymoon. They handled the communication with the airlines and kept us informed every step of the way. We were at dinner when they finally located one of our bags. The Concierge tracked us down at the restuarant and had the hostess inform us of the bags location and that it was en route to the hotel. Simply amazing!    My wife and I took the advice of another reviewer here and stayed in one of the rooms over looking the golf course. The room was cheaper than the ocean view rooms and ended up working out very well for us. We had the last room on the complex and complete privacy. The rooms with the ocean view have heavy foot traffic in front of their lanais. Also, the golf course view rooms have their own parking where as the ocean view rooms have a mandatory valet.    All the food was absolutely delicious. Food is expensive on the resort but portions were a nice size. We took the breakfast package with our reservations and it was well worth the money. The breakfast buffet was unreal. Our only complaint was that there were a lot of flies in the restuarant since it was open to the outside. Ask for a food cover if you leave the table.

119536403,50,Five stars with some comments,"Let me start by saying that anyone who says this is not a five star experience is being ridiculous. This is five stars all the way. From the gorgeous pond where you can get up close and personal with 3000 fishes to the childrens pool, the quiet pool and the adults only pool, it is all wonderfully laid out and the service is, if anything, a bit overwhelming. No sooner do you show interest in a bed by the pool than someone is there with towels, ice water and a cover for the bed. They refill the water regularly, there is suntan cream available, poolside food service and so it goes on. The rooms are impeccable and there is fresh fruit every day at no charge (we were in a suite) . They picked us up from the airport at no extra charge but that may go with the suite. What they tell you about the hotel is all true so I will focius on unique things.  Turtles come out of the water each day and sunbake. Nice.  The beach is enclosed in a big rock pool and is safe.  The cabanas by the pool allow you to spend time at the pool but stay out of the sun.  The golf course winds its way between ancient lava fields and the golf guys could not be nicer. At $250 a round it is not cheap but you don't get to play on a course like this every day.  There are some families there but this is mostly a couples place. No other guest spoke to us the whole 5 days we were there and we are not unfriendly. Whether good or bad, people keep to themselves a bit.  The place is immaculately kept. not a blade of grass out of place.  There is a very nice Italian manager of the dining room who personally made sure everyone was happy.  They have this odd kind of butter, not what you are used to if you are European.  It is the dry side of the Island, so good weather can be counted on.

The grounds are unique and a great representation of the area, from picturesque fresh-water and salt-water ponds, to wonderful-smelling trees and bushes, to golf-course-green-style grass around the pool and beach areas (making walking to the room with sandy or wet feet that much easier), to turtle-resting locales on the beach, to even a small pool with a sand bottom for youngsters to have a safe beach experience, complete with sand-castle-building toys.    Standing out the most, though, are the people working here. As part of an excursion plan, I made a joke about my wife getting sea-sick. Just a brief statement in the midst of many while making our plans. When the concierge delievered our itinerary, it had a small bottle of dramamine as well as some ginger candies that are supposed to help with sea or air-sickness. When my wife mentioned we tend to have an eating ""sprint"" when we share dessert, our shared dessert was divided onto separate plates.    The rooms were spacious cottages, complete with an indoor and outdoor shower. The food was very good, particularly the breakfast buffet. This is important, because it takes a bit of a drive to get to any other restaurants in the area. Of course, the prices are high, but I would actually say they were a good value (beware, my one exception: a standard tanquaray martini was $21 . . . be careful what you order in the alcohol department). The food dishes were creative and well-prepared. The poke appetizer is known as the best on the island.    For us, having a car was a must, as we tend to engage in a lot of activities wherever we go. They had on-site parking for free (there is also a valet option). I'm not a golfer, but the course here is world-class (they had the PGA tour here). It is in great shape, and wonderful to walk around at dusk.    The sunset views are fantastic, and the ambience is very, very relaxing . . . and very romantic.    I've stayed at a number of ""#1"" hotels (rated by various magazines or sites) throughout the world, and I'd have to say this ranked in my top 2 (tied with Singita in South Africa).  As an aside, for the potential honey-mooner (of which there were many here): there's a great shore-break beach for boogie boarding (or body surfing) just up the highway from here: we bought boards at the Kona Walmart and had a great time.

There is a menu of types of baths if you want aromatherapy etc. If you ask for anything the staff will make it happen. Lying by the pool in a shaded cabana is also a service experience. You can get any type of food you may desire, even if it isn't on the menu. The staff come by hourly to clean your sunglasses, spray your face with a cool Evian spray, bring aloe vera, a sample of a fruit smoothie, a cold cucumber scented towel, fresh water etc etc. There are bottles of free sunscreen 15 and 30 as well as leave in conditioner available for use by the pools. The public bathrooms on property have anything you may need as a woman. The bathrooms in the rooms have very high quality L'Occitane shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and after sun lotion. They provide a straw beach bag and nice light bathrobes. The shower was very high quality with excellent water pressure.    There are multiple pools. My favorite was an ocean water pool that was made by a natural reef. I swam with fish and turtles in this pool. There are turtles everywhere in the ocean. They are so graceful and cute. I loved the turtles.    For those that prefer regular swimming pools, there is also a large endless pool with a hot tub overlooking the ocean, an adults only pool and a fitness lap pool in the gym. The gym has daily classes of spinning, yoga and usually some type of class like ""butts and guts.""    The snorkeling on property was spectacular. There was an activity center not affiliated with the hotel that had scooters that you can sit on to snorkel. The scooter allows you speed to travel around with a guide and allows you to dive under water to get a better look and to get back up with just a single breath. It is a must do event. So much fun! There are stand up paddle boards for rent, boats, outriggers etc. The surfing on property would be great except that the waves break on the reef. The staff said if the waves are big enough that you can paddle out further so the waves are not breaking on the reef. If you surf and are used to beach breaks, the reef is a little concerning.    The room was not that big but overlooked the ocean and at night we slept with the sliding doors open and the screen doors closed with very cool ocean breezes and just the sound of the ocean. The property was completely full but was still quiet.    I LOVED THE EXPERIENCE. I am not sure any hotel could compare to this service in the future. I enjoy good luxury hotels but this was miles better than any hotel I have ever been in including the Ritz.    The food was beautiful, perfect, healthy and delicious. Of course, it was a little pricey as breakfast for two (the hot and buffet without alcohol) was about 80 with tip. Dinner for two was about 170 for fish rice veggies fruit and a glass of wine each with tip. However, the food was perfectly prepared. There is room service 24 hours a day as well. I hear that if you book directly with the hotel that sometimes there are specials including breakfast included. That would be a great savings. I booked through American Express travel which gave one night free for every 5 nights that we stayed there.    The only minor complaint that I can think of is the bed. The bed was fine but a little soft at the edges. I could have asked for a feather bed top or I am sure that they would have brought a new bed but it was perfectly acceptable, just not great.I slept just fine with the sound of the waves and the ocean breeze so I never bothered mentioning anything to the staff there to improve my bed quality.

We took our two kids (2yrs & 6 months) along with us and they could not do enough to make us feel welcome and at home. They even had little bibs with the boy names embroidered on them in their cots. There were not that many children around so the kiddies pool was surprisingly empty but there were more than enough toys for a whole heap of children.    The food was lovely and actually reasonably priced for a 5 star hotel. My husband played golf which did cost a bit but that's what you would expect and said it was a great course. We called on our last day to see if we could get a late check out so the boys could sleep before we headed off and it was no problem at all. Didn't leave until 3pm. There was not one employee who didn't seem happy to be there and very helpful.    The only thing I can think of to complain about is the bed was quite soft and after 4 nights sleeping in it there was definitely a 'mould' of where I had been sleeping.    We did the snorkelling tour and had amazing luck that a large pod of about 200 dolphins happened to be going by and we swam with them for 2 hours.

If you are in need of a elegant but understated place to land where you need to relax this is it. I have never experienced such personal service...the staff is there to make your stay perfect. The manager Robert Whitfield was amazing. Among other things he actually took the time to draw us a map and have it delivered to us for an excursion one day. We felt like we were his personal guest. I also want to mention William Panaretos the Asst. Director of food and Beverage that also did everything in his power to make our visit such a memorable one. The spa is amazing too!  The rooms are extremely comfortable and elegant ...the food excellent with many choices. The toughest decision we had every day was to if we wanted to lay by the pool or on the beach in their custom covered lounges for two.( There is a childs pool as well as an adult one which is a huge plus for us).  The Hualalai is pricey but well worth every penny. Robert Whitfield is a gemand has made this resort our absolute favorite and we cannot wait to go back!

119122146,50,Dream Vacation,"Let me start by saying that I won a trip to any four seasons for two nights. Of all of the places I could choose from in the USA we choose the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai at Historic Ka'upulehu. Just because we won the trip does not mean that we were treated any differently. I and my husband used this trip to celebrate our 10 year anniversary. We were greeted by the head of the bellman by name and we were not allowed to even lift a bag. We then were treated to guava juice and pineapple along with leis for each of us. When we were settled we then took a tour of the place with a bellman and then were presented to our room. Within 15 minutes we were sent a bottle of champagne. After this we quickly unpacked and then put on our suits. We went straight for Kings Pond where we were greeted by an attendant who covered our chairs with soft towels and then provided us with swimming towels and ice cold lemon water. Later we had dinner at the islands best restaurant that is at the resort called Pahu i`a where all the staff welcomed us and commented on our anniversary. We went back to our rooms well fed and tired (jet lag). The next day we ate breakfast at Pahu i`a for the breakfast buffet and then checked out each pool. I fed the eagle ray at Kings Pond which was very cool, not just for the kids. Speaking of kids they have a great family pool with handmade sand castle turtles and shells. If we can afford to come back we will definitely bring the kids. If I had to pick a downside I would say that for what we are used to the cost of meals was a bit high however almost always worth it. I am sure that the cost is probably appropriate for Hawaii just not our budget.

118987075,50,"The ""Big Island"" Four Seasons: Conveniently Luxurious","You know you'll have a wonderful stay at any Four Seasons resort, but this particular property stands out for special commendation for two reasons:    1. Convenience: Easy direct flights into the Kona Airport from most west coast cities, and then a quick 10 minute taxi ride to the resort. If for some reason you would want to leave the resort [my wife never did!], then the hotel's concierge serves as a Hertz rental car agent. My kids and I scuba dive, and the hotel is very near Kona's Honokohao Harbor, where all the best dive boats are berthed (the big ones, like Jack's and Kona Honu, plus my favorite: Underwater Adventures, a six-passenger private boat.)    2. Luxury: The beautiful property stretches along a very wide ocean front, has three pools, several resturants, a golf course, spacious rooms, and is maintained to the high standards you expect from a Four Seasons. The staff are of course wonderful. A special feature is a snorkel lagoon stocked with exotic fish and a spotted ray.    I have stayed at many other Four Seasons properties over the years. Indeed my fantasy is to visit ALL of them. So I don't plan repeat visits unless the experience is better than expected.

118780107,50,Aloha Perfection,"This Four Seasons property is amazing and perfect for rest and relaxation. It is one of the most beautiful Four Seasons properties and the service lived up to its well deserved reputation. It was perfect for our needs and perfectly met our expectations. There are however a few details that may not be for everybody. The beach is not the long open beach one expects in Hawaii and due to the lava breaks there is not great swimming or snorkeling off the beach area. If you are looking for beautiful large beaches and great snorkling you must travel to another area of the island or go to the Four Season Maui, which has an incredible beach. Second, is this resort is very large and can be busy due to groups. This is a large property with many different pools and areas, saying that it did not impact our experience or detract for us, but I wanted to make readers aware this is a large property. Also this hotel is very children friendly, which makes it a perfect location to take children, though again if you are looking for the ultimate retreat you may consider the Four Seasons or other properties in Tahiti or the Maldives. It is a great hotel for childrena and families and they blend it well making it also great for couples and romantic getaways.    This property is well designed and the rooms fit the feeling of the Big Island. We enjoyed our balcony and breakfast there every morning. The restaurants were exceptional and overall the food quality and preparation were amazing. The level of detail and service exceeded our expectations and everyone on the property was friendly and welcoming. We celebrated a special event with a beach dinner and it was perfect and the sunsets on this property are somthing to behold. This is an expensive resort as others have noted, but that is to be expected given the property and being on Hawaii. Overall we loved this property and would return.

We have visited the Big Island several times but had never experienced the Four Seasons. We will never stay anywhere else. The property is beautiful but the staff make it exceptional. We were greeted by name by Chenin at valet and she escorted us inside to meet Jason for check in. No waiting in line at the front desk here, Jason presented us with leis and escorted us to a sofa to relax and enjoy refreshments while he handled everything. What a wonderful way to start a vacation after a very long day of travel. We were upgraded to a breathtaking suite. We received exceptional service and kindness from absolutely everyone....the groundskeepers, housekeeping, pool staff...everyone. I would suggest utilizing the concierge services to help you plan dinners, etc. before you arrive. Lindsay was the concierge that helped us and gave us the exact times of the sunsets so we could plan to watch them from various restaurants. You have to experience the Beach Tree Bar. A great place anytime of the day for a snack and drink but the staff is what makes it wonderful. Juli, Jeff, Ed and Steve are exceptional. They all went out of their way to provide us with island and hotel information, fun conversation and out of this world drinks. Steve is a mixology genius! We asked him to create something different for us using fresh ingredients. He went to the kitchen, came back with fresh fruits and vegetables and created the most amazing drinks that should be added to the menu! The property is sprawling so don't hesitate to call for a cart to give you a ride to dinner. Paul saw us often and encouraged us to let him help us get from place to place.

118693345,50,One of the Best,"I was a little hesitant arriving here after hearing about the desolate landscape that this resort was set on. Until I actually got here, I didn't understand the incredible beauty of this resort. It's carved into the dry area of the island on black volcanic rocks and is like an oasis on the island. Being in the dry area is great, since a lot of the island is constantly rainy. We drove the entire island (7-12 hours depending on stops), and the diversity of weather and land is really amazing.    But back to the hotel. Wow. I read these reviews with a lens understanding that most people who stay at Four Seasons and pay $800/night are really picky. And I was surprised that so many people still gave it 5/5 reviews. After staying I'm not surprised at all. The resort truly exceeded my expectations in every way. All of the pools are beautiful. The grounds are impeccably kept. Everyone on the staff greets you warmly. The rooms are amazing, and they left little treats, such as a custom-sewn bib for our baby with her name on it.    The restaurants are all fantastic. We spent almost all of our time at the Beach Tree Bar. Which has maybe the best sunset experiences ever. The food is fantastic, and the cocktails, ""Toms Pink Shirt"" we're dying to go back for.    One tip: make sure you go to the ""Surf, Sand, and Stars"" on Saturday night. Seafood buffet (that's an understatement), with an astronomer, hula, and a band. I've never seen the sky in my life like you can see every night from this beach....

118587532,50,Phenomenal. Sensational. A must experience resort.,"My husband and I spent a blissful 7 nights at Four Seasons Hualalai for our honeymoon and we were both a little heartbroken when our check-out day came. If you've ever had the pleasure of staying at a Four Seasons, which we luckily have, then you pretty much know what to expect when it comes to the overall quality, comfort, service, dining, etc. This resort was beyond our expectations - I wouldn't hesitate to call it perfection.  We arrived at the hotel exhausted, close to 11pm, and were greeted with warm smiles, aloha's and the most delicious mai tai and pineapple we've ever tasted. When we got to our room we found a lovely welcome amenity of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries.  We were in one of their more ""standard"" rooms overlooking the golf course, but it was spacious, luxurious and the bed, needless to say, was heavenly.  We had breakfast every morning at Pahu i'a, which boasts beautiful beachside views. The buffet had plenty of options but my husband could not get enough of the omelet to order station - sorry to say we do not remember the name of the omelet chef but he remembered us every morning and was very kind and extremely personable. Dinner here was just as delightful and if you're there on a Saturday night you must make reservations for their Surf, Sand and Stars buffet. Everything from fresh sushi, lobster tails on the grill, an array of salads and desserts and more! Top it off with a table on the beach (yes, dining with toes in the sand) and live Hawaiian entertainment made it an evening to remember.  Beach Tree was our favorite pool and lunch spot. Poolside amenities included chilled towels, glasses cleaning, smoothie and cocktail of the day shooters and ice pops. The Beach Tree restaurant has light seafood salads and a burger my husband almost drooled over. Dinner at least once during your stay is a must - homemade pasta and osso buco that fell right off the bone.  Did I mention the beautiful, lush landscaping? Gorgeous. And the grounds are nice and spread out so even though the hotel is full of people, it was never hard to find a nice quiet place on the beach where you could feel like you were in your own world for a while.  This is truly a 1st class resort in every way. It made us fall in love with Hawaii and we can not wait to return.

118506238,50,Breathtaking Sunsets and Very Relaxing,"My husband and I spent a week at Four Seasons Hualalai. The resort is absolutely the perfect place to get away if you want to be pampered and enjoy a true relaxing beach vacation. The layout of the resort was conveniently laid out. What I liked most was that there was a pool for every type of guest. There was the family/kids pool which catered equally to the children and their parents. They just added the adults only pool with the swim-up bar as a result of the renovations due to the recent tsunami. My favorite was the Beach Tree pool. The view and proximity to everything was perfect.    The restaurants were all great. You can have a formal meal to a simple, yet filling sushii dinner every night. I never found the options to be lacking. We loved trying a new pizza every night (the best was the fried egg and steak pizza at Beach Tree).    And now, my very favorite part of this vacation and resort. I don't know if the view of the sunset is the same from everywhere in the island, but at least from the resort, it was one of the most breathtaking sites. A glass of wine on the beach chairs while watching the sunset was by far the best way to end each day.    We left the resort one day but after just a couple of hours, wanted to be right back at the resort, enjoying the pool. I've stayed at many Four Seasons worldwide, and this was definitely one of the best. We had to stay our first night at the Sheraton due to the hotel being sold out. We couldn't leave that hotel fast enough. The difference in atmosphere is night and day.    It is ranked #1 on the island for a reason.

118274822,50,Wonderful resort,"This resort is awesome. The property is beautiful and private. Other Kona resorts are all in the same area a few miles north but the Four Seasons stands alone. Due to the expansiveness of the property, the resort never seems crowded. There are a number of different pools- the highlight being King's Pond, a lava rock pool filled with tropical fish and eagle rays. No need to go out and pay for snorkling, it's all at the hotel. The beach in front of the rooms is also an ideal spot to see turtles. I saw one just about every day right on the shore.  The restaurants are expensive but the food is great so if you're really into great food they're worth it. If you just want a meal you're better off going into Kona where it's cheaper and the food is still good.  Every week there's a booklet printed and put in the rooms that lists all the resort activities. Many are free and a great way to squeeze out the value of your stay. There are feeding of the fish, social tennis games, pick up basketball, Hawaiian arts and crafts at the on-site cultural center and many more things to do.

118204741,50,"Breathtaking location and a resort to match, Four Seasons Hualalai is truly outstanding!","What an amazing place! The Four Seasons Hualalai on the Big Island earns it's place on those ""the best"" lists. First off, the grounds and location are stunning -- the contrast between the volcanic rocks and lush greenery is striking and the beach is literally steps away from most rooms. The pools are elegant rest areas and they pamper you with extra comfy chaises and all day amenities (sunglasses gleanings, poolside foot massages, constantly replenished ice water, etc.). The rooms are gorgeous and when I booked our room I mentioned we were celebrating an anniversary. When we arrived they had upgraded us to a beautiful suite with an array of tropical fruits and Voss water waiting for us. Flat screen TVs in the living room and bed room, Bose sound systems and iPod docks, L'Occitane bath products in the bathrooms, Kona coffee for the coffee maker -- all of this and more really took the room to the next level of luxury. The spacious bathroom done in slate and granite had a separate soaking tub and oversized glass enclosed shower. Lots of fluffy bath sheets -- no worries about running out of towels here :) Outside of the room, our balcony spanned the length of our suite and featured chairs and a couch with overstuffed cushions. When we left the room, we discovered lots to do -- a salt water pool stocked with lots of exotic fish with snorkel gear provided, a fitness center offering spin, yoga, Pilates and more, plenty of pools all with stunning views of the ocean and for golfers, a course that I think ranks pretty well (sorry, not a golfer!). We went after Labor Day and if you are looking to enjoy the hotel at a quieter time, or Hawaii in general, this is the perfect time. The weather is still fantastic but the crowds are much reduced. I noticed some families with very small children but no school-aged children. If you choose this resort do be prepared to walk as the grounds are extensive. We had a package that included the breakfast buffet at Pahuiha and it was well worth it. The buffet items were fresh and different every day with a large variety to choose from. I didn't feel like we were missing out by not ordering from the menu. We ate at the Beach Tree restaurant which was very good and right on the beach. More casual than Pahuiha -- beach cover ups and shorts are fine there. We also had dinner at Pahuiha and while it was good, I think for the price I enjoyed Beach Tree more. And be prepared for prices -- it's the Four Seasons in Hawaii, which is kind of a double-whammy:) But this was our last keg of a multi-island trip and we wanted to end on a high note, which we definitely did. The staff were all genuinely friendly and super-accomodating and in my mind it's the staff and service that make a great hotel truly outstanding, which they certainly did.

It's nice that we live on Oahu and it's just a quick 30 minute flight. Every apect of the hotel is top notch. The hotel staff is well trained and seems to really love what they are doing so that makes a big difference. They greet you by your name with a lei (shell for guys), a cool towel and refreshing drinks. For my 3 year old daughter they gave her the same drink but the non-alcohol version. The property is just beautiful. So far this property is by far the best Four Seasons we've stayed at. During our most recent trip here we stayed on the lower level room. At first I was a little hesitant since I really wanted to sit outside the lanai and enjoy our meals out there. But when we got to our room I was very happy I went with the bottom room. I loved the outside shower. You almost feel like your taking a shower in a tropical rain forest except with full privacy. To add on to our wonderful trip the kids pool was perfect for my daughter. She loved it! Because we were on vacation and was going on the same pace as our daughter we did room service for breakfast and lunch by the pool. Their virgin pina colada is the best I've ever had. The service at the pool area was impeccable. We went out to the beach and lay my daughters toys on the lounge chair while we took her into the water. When we came back out the chairs were all set up with towels and ice cold water. Since we were on vacation and were being lazy we had breakfast on our lanai. For dinner we dined at Pahu i' a.

We were told that our luggage would be waiting for us when the room (upgraded) was ready. Spent the morning and majority of the afternoon on the beach in front of the new adult only pool - extremely quiet and relaxing. Received a call on our cell from the front desk notifying us the our room was ready. We were personally shown all the amenities - (side note; first floor rooms are by far the best. We were overlooking the 18th green and had a partial view of the ocean. The outdoor shower was wonderful, but so was the steam shower in bathroom 2. These rooms provide a 'living room as well as a bedroom' so space is no problem) An easy walk to the adult pool.    While the property is certainly a destination resort, know that it's also focused on a large FS resident population. So the 'sports bar' is not officially a FS restaurant the food and service were both wonderful though. The food at the FS restaurants did not quite meet the expectation we had in our recollection of other FS properties but i certainly would still recommend eating there.    If you are looking for an inexpensive place to stay this certainly is not it, but that should be no surprise. Mixed drinks on the beach/pool $18.00/beer $8.00, but you're at the FS and hopefully on vacation so go with it. To maintain a semblance of savings though we hit the local store (on property) and picked up drinks and snacks. Our room had a fridge, which was stocked with water, cream, milk everyday.    The property is beautiful - take a jog or walk on the path to see some of the beautiful homes and golf course. Three pools - what we called a 'kids' pool, main pool and adult only pool - as mentioned we spent the majority of our time at the adult pool/beach - very, very quiet and relaxing. Spa was incredible and the indoor/outdoor gym was perfect.    Only about 10 minutes from the airport, but a significant distance away from anything else, but certainly worth the trip - we didn't want to leave and will be back.",Sep 2011,August 2011,Traveled as a couple,,"Columbia, South Carolina"
118004967,50,Would return in a heartbeat!,"My husband and I stayed at the Four Seasons Hualalai in June, 2010 and had an amazing time! Not only was the hotel's service impeccable and without any flaws but the site is truly breathtaking with its beautiful landscaping and unexpected level of privacy. The room was extremely spacious and beyond perfect.    We occasionally dined out on the lanai and loved the view of the ocean. There's such a zen watching the crashing waves.    It is of course, expensive but was worth every penny. The sunsets were out of this world every night, in a shade of pink and blue beyond belief.    We enjoyed their restaurant, Pahu i`a, with a delightful surf and turf under the stars. The food was incredible and just warms your heart. You never felt ""intruded"" on as the wait staff would gently fold your napkin when you got up or clear the table.

Only 10 minute drive from the airport, we were greeted immediately by friendly staff who new our names. Our room had a great view of the ocean and lagoon (lazy snorkelers didn't have to venture far to see fish/ +1 15 y.o. sting ray). Breakfast buffet was top notch(omelets w/shrimp/smoked salmon/fresh juices/longan/2 types of bacon/100% french press kona coffee!!~extra 18 bucks thou), we even saw 2 green turtles sleeping on the beach in front of us on day 1! there are 3-4 swimming pools as well. Each one well staffed who would set you up so fast. Of course they also had complimentary sunblock/head conditioner/iced water w/lemon). We went to the spa(to bad NOT co-ed) as well...superb. the Eucalyptus Sauna was ridiculous. We went into the town exploring/dining so we didn't really try the restaurants for dinner, but heard they were excellent. there are jog paths, and a niffy jog map provided. We only did it once, as we were on our honeymoon and preferred to be fatties. Must say,would come back for a anniversary. surprisingly kid friendly as well, but wasn't so obvious, didn't muck up the romantic appeal.Was sad to leave after spending nearly 1 week there.

The level of service is second to none. The rooms and facilities in general are nicely appointed. The pools and beaches are stunning. The staff are very helpful and friendly. Yes, it's expensive, but it's well worth it.    If you're looking for a low-key vacation, this is a great choice. If you're looking to really explore the island, it's a decent choice. It's a two-hour drive to Hilo and a three-hour drive to the volcano. Kailua-Kona is only about 20-30 minutes away. Also, the terrain on this side of the island is pretty desolate compared to other parts of the island. So if you're looking for a ""postcard"" picture of Hawaii, you may want to choose another part of the island, as this area looks like you landed on the moon.

117509057,50,Perfect Honeymoon!,"My husband and I stayed at the Hualalai for 4 nights during our honeymoon on the Big Island. It was PERFECT! We were pampered and petted to our heart's content. We just arrived home yesterday, and I'm in major withdrawal already.    For the first three nights they were able to upgrade us to a suite, which was completely to die for... a wonderful lanai with views of the ocean, luxurious restroom (1.5!) and a separate living room and bedroom. The beds were comfortable, the sheets soft, the decor lovely, and the amenities amazing (the L'Occitane shampoo/conditioner kept my hair soft and workable even after days spent in the pool and ocean).    The first day we had a couples massage and explored the grounds. There are three pools... one for kids (we never tried this), one called the ""quiet"" pool which had cabanas and poolside service for anything you could want, and one called the ""adult"" pool with a swim up bar (we spent most of our time there). Again, all were everything you could wish for. We traveled the island and took part in some activities off-site during our stay, but each night when we returned we felt almost regretful (despite how cool the activities were!) that we hadn't spent the whole day basking in luxury at the resort.    We ate dinner at the Beach Tree on our first night, and it was amazing. We live in NYC and regularly go out for fine dining in the city, and this meal was up there. Breakfast each morning was at the Pahu i'a. Most days the breakfast buffet was more than enough for us. It was about $44 p/p, although a la carte and room service can be much cheaper. Although everything was pricey, you never felt like you were being ripped off like you do at some resorts... the price corresponds to the quality corresponded.    Hualalai has amazing concierge staff, attentive turndown and day maids, and excellent room service. No request was too small, and they always provide itineraries delivered to your room and confirmation calls for any activities booked through them. Everyone seemed genuinely friendly too... the valet ended up giving us some great local tips for our drive around the island in casual conversation (as in, not just waiting for a tip!)    Although we must have visited during a busy season and there looked to be quite a few rooms at the resort we could find privacy and personal attention from the staff whenever we wanted it. I think our favorite experience was sharing a bottle of prosecco at night on the beach staring up at the clear, clear Hawai'ian sky... waves crashing and sea turtles resting nearby in a perfectly private setting...

117357716,20,Not Great,"We had heard the most amazing things from our friends about this hotel for years. We were looking forward to coming to the hotel based on what people had told us. Well, unfortunately this hotel and the experience are far below the Four Seasons standards. I will attempt to provide some useful information based on a variety of criteria:    Accommodations: The headline hear is the rooms are getting pretty run down. Wallpaper is yellowing from age, tiles are filthy, and outside shower area for each room needs a thorough cleaning (wear thongs as it is kind of like being at a 24 HR fitness locker room).    Pool Area: there are a multitude of different pools, grotto like pool, adult pool, family pool, freshwater fish pool. We spent most of our time at the family pool and adult pool. If you come to Hawaii to sit by a pool without kids then the adult pool is not bad. It is quiet, clean and pretty. If you have kids you will probably be spending time at the family pool. This pool is average. It has the obligatory little waterfall, tile bottom and a jacuzzi that is warm but with little to no jet pressure. The chairs around this pool are so so. Some shade and some with pop-up covers but nothing special. If you want to get something near the ocean and the pool you'll need to wake at the crack of dawn as they go fast.    Beach Area: Well, if your Hawaii is about sun sand and beach then this is definitely NOT the hotel for you. The beach at the hotel is one of the worst we have ever experienced in Hawaii, to the point that you kind of wonder why someone would think to even build a hotel at this location. It cannot compare to the Mauna Kea beach, the beach at the Four Season Maui or even the small beach at the Kahala. There are not enough chairs even for this small beach.    Service: The ""legendary Four Seasons"" service was present every now and then. Perhaps it was due to our stay being over a busy period - so we will give the hotel a little benefit of the doubt, but the service is certainly not at the consistent Four Season level. Pool side service was adequate with intermittent poolside otter pops and the like and restaurant service was fine although on most days we had to wait a long time for service at lunch.    Food: what comes to mind is the word ""same"" as in same as any other hotel, as in same at every restaurant on the property, as in same every day. Would hope for at least something special, different, memorable.    Fitness Facility/Spa: The one bright spot is the fitness facility/ spa. Very nice and clean. It has all the machines you need both cardio and weight, nice locker area with all the expected amenities and services.    Overall: I would not put this hotel in the category of a super luxury resort. There are a number of other Hawaiian hotels that are far prettier, better service, better beach and better pool.",Aug 2011,August 2011,Traveled with family,,"Newport Beach, California"

116943147,30,Rough Start but Decent Ending,"We booked this hotel at the raving recommendation of our travel agent who has visited this property many times. It was the final stop on our Polynesian Honeymoon and we were very excited based on the reviews that we had read. In addition we had stayed at the Four Seasons in Bora Bora a week before and were excited to get back to Four Seasons after staying at a St. Regis hotel. The St. Regis was great but based on our Four Seasons experience in Bora Bora we were really looking forward to this Four Seasons.    Well were we underwhelmed and disappointed when we arrived. It was just all very plain. The check-in was blah, the room was at the far end of the property and in general the whole thing felt like we were checking into a mid-range Sheraton in Boise. The air conditioning was pointed directly at the bed so it blew directly on us the first night and we were so tired that we didn't want to have someone come in to fix it. We were optimistic that it would get better, and kept waiting for that moment when we would discover what all the raves were about. Well, we waited. And waited. And waited.    And then, things actually started to go very wrong. Our room started to smell like sewage. We had to call multiple times for them to come and check it out. The smell went away for the rest of that day but came back. Nobody followed up to see how it was. Not very Four Seasons of them. We had the worst service ever at the bar one night. And just a few other mishaps that normally we would overlook but because they just kept piling up they were hard to ignore. I mean, we even saw dead fish in the King's Pond, which is their man-made pond where you can snorkel. It was gross and we got out right away. Just felt like it should have been better maintained since there is staff on hand.    We finally couldn't take it anymore and sent a letter outlining all of the things that had gone wrong. We really didn't want to complain but it was getting unbearable and not what one would expect from a top tier resort.    Our complaints were instantly addressed by a director and they offered to relocate us to another room. We didn't want to move as it was our last night and we were all unpacked and had been traveling for 3 weeks at this point. But the gesture was greatly appreciated. In addition they provided us with a beautiful dinner on the beach and when we returned to our room there were flower petals all over and amenities (champagne, chocolate covered strawberries).    It absolutely changed the entire experience of the hotel and we would go back. I think it was a total fluke what happened to us but we are so grateful to that manager for turning it around and making the last night of our honeymoon one to remember.    By the way, the spa and fitness center are fabulous as were the sunsets. We really enjoyed the adult only quiet pool. It is a beautiful property and I really think that the resort is much better than the experience that we had which is why we would be willing to try it again on our next trip to Hawaii.",Aug 2011,July 2011,Traveled as a couple,,"New York City, New York"

My kids (age 10 and 13) loved the family pool and spent hours there everyday. I think they were disappointed that there was not a better beach at the hotel, and it did get a little sleepy for them after a few days. But there are so many day trips and things to do around the island so the quietness of the resort was not a huge issue overall.  The service and staff of the hotel is outstanding. Our luggage got stuck in Honolulu and the Four Seasons actually has a greeter at the Kona airport and this lovely woman (Chandy I think her name was) waited for our bags and had them sent by car later in the evening.

For example, I could lounge on a very comfortable beach chair with a ""hood"" that I could pull up for shade and get flufy towels at no additional charge. There also was a spot where bottled water was available at no additional charge. My room was just steps from the immaculate beach and it was so quiet at night that I opened the patio door and fell asleep to the sound of the waves.

116234391,50,Go--You will simply never regret it and will certainly want to go back the moment you leave!,"THE SHORT ANSWER  This place and its people are amazing! If you are reading reviews to consider where to take your next vacation or where to stay while in Hawaii, trust me that this place blows away the competition. And, a bit of a warning speaking from personal experience, if you are visiting multiple islands/hotels in the Hawaiian Islands, it's best to save 4S Hualalai for last or I'm afraid you will be disappointed with the others after having experienced Hualalali. We are not the type of travelers who always find ourselves revisiting a certain location as we are fairly young and feel like there is so much to see, do and visit in the World. However, every time my husband and I have a conversation about our next getaway, I continue to find myself drawn to 4S Hualalai. We've visited 4 times in the last 3-4 years and will certainly be back many more including this year.    THE BACKGROUND  We are a couple in our early 30s who loves to travel. We very much enjoy beach/tropical locations. We have had the wonderful opportunity to visit some amazing places and have very high expectations in terms of service, aesthetic and overall experience when staying at 5* locations. I’d say we appreciate laidback perfection--perfection without pretention--this place has that down!  I mention these locations because they will give the reader a frame of reference for our writing of this review….Las Ventanas and Esperenza in Cabo, Calistoga Ranch and Auberge in Napa, Laucala private island in Fiji, Kauri Cliffs in New Zealand, 4S Maui and Lani, Little Dix Bay and Jumby Bay in the Caribbean and various other Aman, 4S, Peninsula and Ritz properties throughout the world.    THE LONG ANSWER  • Children: Great for families with children but not annoying for those couples like us traveling without children: Somehow 4S Hualalai has managed to make this the perfect family and romantic couples resort. From what we could tell, their programs for children are extensive and well planned out while also not being intrusive to couples on a romantic getaway  • Service and Management: I cannot say enough about the wonderful people at 4s Hualalai. Coming back to the resort post Tsunami and listening to everyone talk about how hard they worked to get the resort open (and, in my opinion even better than before) made me realize how they truly are a team; The GM, Mr. Whitfield, who you can see about the property each day in his Hawaiian shirt and shorts, is a sharp, kind and fun guy who, for a lack of a better word, just “gets it”! If I named everyone I love at this resort by name, I’d be here all day but must say that Steve and Tom make the best cocktails around and are a joy to hang out with—talented, fun guys who enjoy mixing something special up just for you…I could stay for hours having drinks and, well, I have! Kalai and Jenna in special events are rock stars—sweet, patient rock stars with an entire rock star crew working with them. Conrad, Camille, Chef Nick…I could go on and on.  • Price: Yes, the resort is expensive. But, that’s not surprise. It’s a 5* luxury 4S in Hawaii. Know this fact going in and decide up front that you won’t fret about the costs of lunches, dinners, drinks, etc. As an aside, compared to other similar luxury beach resorts, the prices here are not offensive. And, there are great deals to be had—for example Beach Tree Happy Hour and taking advantage of all the no additional fee activities or visiting when it’s not a busy time of year and the hotel has a free night special (the weather is almost always perfection)  • The Rooms: On a beach vacation, I like a nicely sized room with an ocean view where you can hear the waves, and a patio is a must. A high-rise hotel in a tropical location with an ocean view that is 2 football fields away…no thank you. I’ll pass. The rooms here are nothing like this and are wonderful in a unique restrained Hawaiian luxury style! If you are on a tight budget, even the entry level golf ocean view rooms are a nice option and have a pretty (although distant) ocean view. I would however go with an ocean view or ocean front room in one of the main crescents if it’s within your budget. The rooms, other than a few suites housed in 1 story sections and the end of the crescents, are housed in two story bungalow type buildings with large patios and great views situated around 1 of 4 of the property’s pool attractions—(1) King’s Pond (2) Seashell (3) Beach Tree and (4) Palm Grove. I won’t say what my favorite is simply because I don’t want to make it more difficult for me to get the room I want next time I book! Each of the first floor rooms have outdoor lava rock showers while each of the second floor rooms offer what I think is a slightly better ocean view but without the outdoor shower. The suites are wonderful and have a few additional amenities. However, unless you need the additional space for children or it is within your budget to upgrade to one of the newly remodeled or specialty suites (think steam shower, huge patio and views galore…possibly even a private Jacuzzi and/or pool depending on how deep within the pockets you are willing to dig), I would recommend using the additional funds to put toward other activities/expenses while at the hotel as the “regular” ocean view, ocean view prime and ocean front rooms within the 4 crescents are lovely.  • The Pools: You can pick your pool based upon your mood, which is nice. The new adult only palm grove pool with swim-up bar is gorgeous with wonderfully fresh drinks. But, the Beachtree pool is also a fabulous adults-only option and is close to the Beachtree bar (still our fav pool!); if you want to snorkel but not venture into the ocean, try kings pond. And, if you want some fun in the sun with the kiddos, seashell is hard to beat. As an aside, the seashell pool is so darn pretty that we would lay poolside some days even with kiddos playing around us.  • The Activities: You could visit for weeks and still find new things to do. We aren’t the type of travelers who like to pack to much into our trip and very much enjoy relaxing by the ocean or pool but they have everything from scooter snorkel, to paddle board to private or group boating adventures to hiking and ziplining. Take a look at their Voyages Brochure and you will quickly see that you don’t have to worry about getting bored!  • The Food & Drinks: While I must admit that I miss Alan Wong’s restaurant that used to be here terribly and feel like Hualalai needs to work hard to get another great option in to replace it, the food and drinks at 4S Hualalai are top notch. I’m a picky eater. I hardly ever order something right off the menu as is. It’s a fault of mine and is annoying to my friends. However, it wasn’t annoying to the staff here (or at least they hid their annoyance very well!); The hotel has 2 main restaurants—Beach Tree and Pahaui’a. Additionally, the Hualalai Grille was open during this past visit for a casual place to dine and play billiards (although, the hours are very odd and make no sense to me). The Residents Beach House was not reopened yet in May but I’m guessing it is now and is open for lunch to hotel guests. And, I love the new snack bar with ice cream, coffee, shaved iced and snacks beach front! The hotel also has two wonderful bars (with food options of course)—The Lava Lounge and Beach Tree. Beach Tree restaurant is our favorite for lunch and dinner. I feel that each time we visit, it simply keeps getting better and better! The menu has something to please everyone (brick oven pizza, yummy homemade pastas, fresh seafood and mouthwatering steak) and the chef routinely says hello to guests. On the other hand, other than the breakfast at Pahui’a that is the best breakfast at a hotel anywhere in my opinion, I could skip it all together in favor of drinks and food in the upstairs Lava Lounge (you can still get the great Sushi from Pahui up there in addition to my favorite, the pork buns). Saving the Best for last…Dear Beach Tree Bar, I love you….from your fabulous staff (see above) to your great sunset views to your menu and extensive wine by the glass list, I miss you and can’t wait to see you again.  • The Gym and Spa: The gym facilities at this hotel are hands down the very best that we have experienced while on vacation. We always feel inspired to work out more while we are visiting simply because there are so many wonderful class options and great equipment. The spa is charming and the treatment options vast. I personally enjoy the couple’s treatments in the special outdoor bungalow. Each time we have visited, spa reservations have been difficult to obtain at our desired times even in advance. Plan well ahead and know that you most likely won’t have flexibility if you want to change to another date or time.  • The Ocean: I have read reviews by other guests in the past prior to our first visit that noted that the ocean isn’t swimmable. I admit, I am not a big swim in the ocean all day girl…a relaxing dip and fun splash around suit me just fine…but I have to say that I do think the ocean is swimmable and have seen many guests enjoying a swim during our stay. This is Hawaii, however, so yes there is Lava Rock. Yes, it’s not a vast sandy beach that stretches for miles, but that gorgeous black rock against the pristine blue waters and white sands…wow! It’s hard for me to understand complaints about it. And, the resort has a very nice area of the ocean that is sectioned off to include no lava rock or big waves for guests’ enjoyment    THE IMPROVING UPON PERFECTION PART:  I don’t have a cons section. And believe me, I’m a tough critic. But, Hualalai does so many things so perfectly that I can’t think of a valid “con”. Yes, sometimes the hotel can miss the mark on something minor as can anyone but if they do, you can trust that they will make up for it 10 fold. To me, this is one of the biggest praises I can have for a resort—knowing how to handle a mix up in a way that makes you even happier. I think the new adult only pool at Palm Grove could benefit from some services that make it stand apart form the other pool options even more. How about mini spa services poolside from your lounge. Nothing like having your feet or neck rubbed with scented aromatherapy oils while sipping a cocktail with fresh berries and taking in the great view!. And, this could alleviate the stress on the spa schedule. I also think Pahui’as dinners have more potential than the location currently lives up to. That being said, it’s still good!    THE SUMMARY (FINALLY!):  This review is long overdue and also just plain long, but as I’m looking at reviews on TA for a separate trip, I had thoughts of 4S Hualalai and was suddenly compelled to take the time to sing its praises just as it has taken the time to make us happy guests year after year. My only hesitation is that this review will make getting a reservation more difficult for us on future visits!",Aug 2011,May 2011,Traveled as a couple,Decide upfront if you rather a outdoor lava shower room or a second story view room and make that...,"Houston, Texas"
115909419,50,First Family Vacation - will be hard to top,"This was our first vacation post-baby. Typically we are exotic travellers, so when I had a free week in May I researched Bali, Fiji, Maldives, all the far-flung sand & sun locations. Frankly, booking Hawaii seemed like a cop-out and a failure. Passing up the chance to get my passport stamped somewhere new in exchange for staying in the US felt like failure.    However, we never expected this resort to be as GREAT as it was. I thought this level of service was non-existent in US-based properties these days, but fortunately for everyone, America Service isn't just an oxymoron!    We actually stayed not in the hotel property, but at a Villa rental on the property, which includes full access to all the FS services and room charge privileges. This is something I highly recommend - let me lay it out for you --    We were paying about $550 per night + resort fees for the smallest (I believe) Villa layout at the property. But this ""smallest"" Villa is the equivalent of 3X the space of the typical $1000 per night room, with a killer kitchen, lanai, 2 bedrooms, awesome bathroom, outdoor shower, view, and garage for parking.    The only compromise was being a 5-minute golf cart ride from the central pool area, but crusiing back and forth and exploring the property on the Villa's dedicated golf cart ended up being half the fun!    I guess room service access was also a downside, but they were well prepared for that as well - just call up room service and they will deliver to the Valet, so a quick trip via car or golf cart, all done!    The place is kid friendly maybe to a fault. We were blown away by the pool staff's attentiveness and amenities like free ""pack & play"" loans at the beach, free snacks, etc. The restaurants were uniformly great, they didn't even charge for kids' meals (mistake? it seemed consistent in this regard). There WERE a lot of kids around, but I think even had we been sans kid, it wouldn't have negatively impacted us.    This was the first property where, instead of the usual ""what can we do today"" mentality, we ended up doing a LOT less around Kona than we intended, preferring instead to bask in the hospitality of the FS staff. We settled into a daily routine that revolved around the pools, walks on the beach, visits to the spa, etc. This was a real change of pace for us, normally we can't sit still!    Only downside was a botched Spa appointment, but they made good on it and accomodated us with minimal disruption.    Also my wife and I really never consider staying at the same place twice, its just anathema to my wanderlust, but we both agreed upon leaving here that returning again (and doing the Villa rental again) was definitely on the agenda.",Jul 2011,May 2011,Traveled with family,"Check out vacation rentals for Villas on property, tremendous value, full access to property,...","Marin County, CA"

115871831,50,Best beach resort in the world for couples and families!,"We've have stayed in private Four Seasons villas with pools in Bali, Suites in Paris at the George V, and visited more than one Aman but nothing compares to our experience at the Four Seasons Hualalai. From the moment you greeted with an aloha and a lei and enter the lobby looking out at the Beach Tree Pool and ocean beyond, you know you are checking in to paradise.    The service is warm, genuine, and welcoming from the moment you arrive. The staff really care about making you comfortable and introducing you to their beautiful island resort. As you ride to your room (600 sq ft. minimum) they might have time to tell you some of the highlights of the resort including, snorkeling at King's Pond stocked with beautiful reef fish, the ukulele classes, computers to use, Hawaiian language classes, basket weaving, guided nature tours, tennis courts, and fitness walk by the ocean (highly recommend) all free amenities. Every evening there will be a print out of the next days activities waiting for you by your bed, every day a new adventure or another opportunity to relax.    The rooms are very comfortable, decorated in tasteful Hawaiian decor. We've stayed in every cresent except the Palm Grove as we prefer to be a little closer to the gym and restaurants. All rooms at the hotel are beautiful and almost all have a view of the ocean. Even the slightly less expensive golf view rooms have beautiful views of the water. As with many Four Seasons you can request the type of pillow you want, hypoallergenic blankets and sheets, even aromatherapy.    Thoughtful touches abound. During our most recent stay I was awake due to the time difference and I didn't want to wake my partner. I thought, I wish they had a night light by the bed and when I opened the drawer I found just what I wanted. This intuative planning on the part of the hotel management is experienced throughout the resort from the perfectly timed smoothie tastings by the pool, guide to the fish in King's pond, to the sample they gave me from the amazing spa.    Tips: If you like the idea of an outdoor shower (we thought it was fun!), request a lower floor room.  If you would like a special main dish or dessert you don't see on the menu order it a few days in advance as a surprise for the person you are traveling with.  This place is perfect year round but at least once in your life go during Jan/February when the mothers are birthing and raising their babies. Take a kayak gently out into the ocean and quietly watch while the mother whales jump and then the babies, feet away from you.  End your evening by going up to the bar at the Lava Lounge for super service, to watch the illuminated waves wash upon the shore, and to listen to live music from Pahuia.  There are at least three complimentary coffee stations around the resort in the mornings. The lobby lounge offering has mini muffins if you arrive early. The other two locations are by the breakfast area near Pahuia and near the gym.  They serve great frozen coffee drinks and fresh fruit smoothies near the gift shop (also worth a visit!).    This resort is continually improving and breaking new grounds in luxurious comfort under the guidance of General Manager, Robert Whitfield. I'd also like to thank Beth who cares for and lead Hualalai's peerless athletic team, Sebastian, a fantastic front desk Manager, Carlos-the best massage therapist (and I've had many good massages but he is the best), Rita who keeps me afloat with her smile and aloha, and Nick, the Italian chef of the Beachtree Grill (from Restaurant 57 in New York who makes sure every meal is delicious).

All the little details are covered (similar to what many other posters below highlight). If you are coming to relax and enjoy a beautiful setting, this is a great spot. If you are coming for a great beach and ocean swimming this is not really your place. With all the lava rock there is a very small space for swimming which the Four Seasons did their best to remove and make a small spot for guests to swim. However this is still rocky which was slightly disappointing.    That said, the food is great, the sunsets are amazing, the spa/sports facilities are world class. The concierge staff is also a HUGE plus. They are available and extremely knowledgeable to answer any questions you have about the island. A couple other suggestions, try the Blue Hawaiian Helicopter tour, great views of the Volcanoes National Park, Waterfalls, lava, etc. Also take a visit the Mauna Kea beach for the white sand experience, great swimming.",Jul 2011,July 2011,Traveled as a couple,,"Denver, Colorado"
115774154,50,We thought it was unreal the first time. It was even better this trip!!,"Wow, it is very difficult to review a place as fabulous as this resort. It was so good I wouldn't know where to start. I'll try to give some highlights. My wife and I went back to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We actually got married at this resort four years ago. From the second we arrived, you would have thought two long lost friends of the Four Seasons had finally made it back. From everyone knowing our names, the complimentary champagne in the room, everyone wishing us a happy anniversary, the hand written card left by the general manager in the room, to the free drinks on our anniversary dinner night, etc., etc. I could go on much further, but you get the idea. This is hands down the finest tropical resort in the U.S., if not the world. Everything about this place screams luxury in a laid back setting. Something only the Four Seasons could pull off. The pools, rooms, staff, grounds, spa, restaurants, and gardens are all impeccable. So, if your going to the Big Island, it shouldn't be hard to figure out where to stay. Be forewarned: You better be ready to get off the wallet. Your bill at checkout will be close to the total price of the room! Was it worth it? There is no question that we will be back to Hualalai in the near future.

115058527,50,One of the BEST Hotels Ever,"We are fortunate enough to stay in wonderful hotels around the world and this is, hands down, one of the best hotels ever. There really aren't enough adjectives but it's a stunning property, from the grounds, to the golf course, to the beach, to the restaurants and Lava Lounge. The service is unparalleled, from check-in to room service to pool service. For example, we were asked at check-in what time do we prefer our room cleaned? A small thing perhaps but I like our room cleaned early am and it was cleaned on time everyday when I requested. We have stayed in 4 star hotels were we are making repeated calls to room service to please clean our room and it's 5:00PM. Not at this hotel, unless of course you want your room cleaned at 5:00PM. One day at the pool I asked for a drink but decided to go look at turtles on the rocks before the pool hostess returned with my drink. I assumed she would just put it next to my chair. She came and found me with my drink on the rocks. So unexpected and just flawless customer service. We were at breakfast one morning and our friend requested something special because of rather severe food allergies. The waitress came back within a few minutes explaining they didn't have what he requested, and they were so sorry, but they had just sent someone to the store to purchase it for him so we would have it for the rest of the trip. Every day and within every department of the hotel, we were treated to this level of service. And we are just average everyday people. Not any type of VIP.  I loved our room. We overlooked the family pool and had a delightful view of the ocean beyond. Our room had all the amenities one would want. A large screen TV with movie rentals, very good A/C, curtains to make the room dark, a really large and beautiful bathroom, ample closet and drawer space, wireless internet (that worked well), coffee maker, big desk for work (my husband works on vacations) etc. We had a wonderful package rate which included 6 spa appointments, complimentary breakfast every day and one complimentary lunch. My husband took advantage of the 6 spa appointments and he said his massages were some of the best deep tissue sports massages he has had. The spa is beautiful and serene. After an appointment, you can relax, as long as you'd like, in the spa sauna or steam room and in their relaxation garden. It's lovely.  We worked out everyday and this hotel has all manner of fitness equipment, from cardiovascular, to free weights, to spinning classes, to pilates, to yoga. It's clean, state of the art equipment. It's next to a coffee/smoothie bar which turned out to be one of our favorite spots. We have 2 teenage boys and they have a large basketball court next to the fitness center and a pool table in the sports bar area and a foosball table next to the family pool where you can also get Hawaiian ice throughout the day. There is a snorkling pool on property as well and a climbing wall. Not only is it an incredible romantic getaway but also the perfect family hotel. So good, in fact, we have already booked a return trip for next spring break.  In short, this is a not to be missed hotel and should be on everyone's Top Hot Hotel List.

114996796,50,Very special luxury experience with touches of magic,"We spent two nights at the Four Seasons Hualalai in midJune. Our experience with the Four Seasons' outstanding service began with my phone call asking for a red rose to be placed in our room in honor of my husband's birthday when we arrived. The concierge was lovely, wrote a note for him in Italian, and when we arrived we found we had been upgraded to an oceanview room. Staff was unobtrusively gracious throughout our stay--the beach staff in particular were wonderful.  Our room was large, with beautiful slate floors, a luxurious bathroom and a spacious lanai. Both in the room and everywhere else in the Four Seasons, we were struck by how beautiful and also extremely comfortable the furniture was. Although the ocean was not swimmable (one big negative), the swimming pools were gorgeous, including a 28 meter lap pool with a blue tile bottom which is the most beautiful pool I have ever swum in. There is also a salt water pond where you can snorkel. Sunscreen and leave-in hair conditioner are by each pool, as is cold water and cool wet washcloths to refresh you.  There is also a beautiful walk along the sea, which is spectacular and quite long.  Our very best experience at the Four Seasons was a morning we spent on the beach reading and watching the ocean in comfortable lounge furniture that has a kind of hood c to shade you if you want it. Staff brought us virgin lava flows and mahi mahi tacos (which were the best food we had on the island) in bento boxes for lunch. The word ""paradise"" did come to mind.  The resort is very expensive, but worth it and I think the bottom category golf/ocean view rooms would also be fine. We don't know the exact cost we paid because our trip was very ably organized by my husband's company's travel agent, Leslie Borghetti of Custom Travel (her own business) in Massachusetts. She was able to get us a price $2000 less than I had been able to find on a combination flight, rental car, two hotels and a B and B. I highly recommend both her and the Four Seasons.",Jul 2011,June 2011,Traveled as a couple,,San Francisco CA

It is beautiful with the most amazing, professional, courteous staff we have ever encountered. I really don't know how the Four Seasons does it, but they make luxury feel so understated, you're not remotely embarrassed when one of the pool staff comes by and offers to clean your sunglasses!    We were a family of 4 so we rented one of the privately owned villas on the property (just slightly up the hill from the resort's facilities). It made sense because individual rooms at the hotel started at $875 (we needed two), so we were able to rent a 3-bdr villa for less than the cost of two FS rooms. The villas offer full charge & usage priviledges at the Four Seasons, and we had a golf cart to ride around the property - easy!    They have (4) pools to choose from (one adults only, one family, and one quasi-adult pool next to the Beach Tree restaurant). The fitness center is unbelievably equipped: heated yoga studio, spinning room with 19 new bikes, full cardio-room, and quiet lap pool.    I had a Lomi-Lomi (Hawaiian) massage at the spa. AMAZING! The treatment rooms are in individual private ""huts"" so you can have your massage open-air without anyone nearby. This is easily the best massage I have ever experienced (Leslie was my therapist).

We even got a gift from one of our frequent servants for being pleasant in return.    Only caveat that I can say is, I was somewhat disappointed in the golf course. The fairways, rough, scenery, pace of play were perfect. The golf staff was very pleasant and helpful. My issue was that the greens were fairly bare.

114202803,50,Better than ever!,"My wife and I just returned to Hualalai for the first time since 2008. We were concerned about the effect of the recent Tsunami, that had caused some significant damage to the resort. Not to worry; they've done an excellent job of recovering, and in fact, they've improved the resort. We always liked the Palm Grove area because it was quiet, relatively secluded, and an excellent vista (there is literally nothing like watching a sunset across the Pacific, with the silhouetted palm trees in the foreground gently swaying). What's new is a useable infinity pool that is a significant upgrade from what was there in the past.    However, what really makes the place (aside from the beauty and restfulness) is the warmth, friendliness, and helpfulness of the staff--and I do mean everyone. They know that a major reason that guests repeatedly return is because of the way one feels pampered, and they really work hard to make a guest feel pampered and special--without overdoing it.

113474373,40,Conference Business Can Ruin a Really Good Thing,"Our family of three spent almost a week at this Four Seasons and were quite impressed. I echo the sentiments of the previous reviewer, however, that the conference business this hotel enjoys can ruin it for guests on family or couples vacations. The very first night, there was a HUGE conference party DIRECTLY outside our room. This included a dinner buffet, cocktails, live music and the like. Even though this party lasted until 9:30 p.m., which really isn't that late, it's not too much to expect at a resort in this price range for peace and quiet at that time (especially for families with children, or even couples on a milestone anniversary or honeymoon for that matter!). Management makes a terrible mistake to host these corporate events so close to guest rooms. Hopefully this is a practice they will change as it seems there were several other more suitable locations.    The food at this Four Seasons is exceptional and we had one of the best meals of our lives at Pahui'a.    And, most importantly, the staff at this resort was wonderful.",Jun 2011,June 2011,Traveled with family,Choose a first floor room for outdoor shower.,"Houston, Texas"
113413362,30,Mixed Feelings,"We went here to celebrate a milestone birthday. The resort is nice enough and the golf course is beautiful. Service was very mixed, room service and check-in staff were super and very accommodating but others like the formal restaurant manager and golf pro really treated us poorly and put a damper on our stay. I guess they needed to blame someone for a damaged golf cart and they accused us - but we did NOT damage anything and had to endure snippy comments from golf staff which made us cancel our golfing after the second day. The restaurant lost our reservations and couldn't understand why we didn't wish to stay and spend $300 ++ for dinner when we were the only people seated inside looking at a wall when every other guest was seated outside with an ocean view and there were plenty of empty tables outside on the deck. The fuss they made ruined the evening we had looked forward to for days. No one went in the ocean, there is little beach to speak of since the coastline is black lava rock which is sharp and difficult to navigate without injury. The pools were beautiful and the service around the pools was great. Valet parking is expensive and charged daily so self park from arrival to save big $$. The extremes of our experience here made the whole stay disappointing.",Jun 2011,May 2011,Traveled as a couple,Lower level rooms have outdoor showers - fun,"New Hartford, New York"
112946054,40,Second visit was slightly underwhelming...,"My husband and I stayed here on our honeymoon two years ago and died and went to heaven. This basically happened on this trip as well but this time with two caveats.    The entire property was full of business meeting and conference groups. Normally this wouldn't bug me but as someone who has a hard time detaching from work, it was a distraction to me to see people roaming around with name tags, talking business at the bar and generally not being there for relaxation. They were not in a lulled state of Zen like the families and couples elsewhere. This made my normally blackberry/email addicted mind keep going back to that world I was trying hard to forget for one week.    The second caveat. Our ocean front room faced the Beach Tree Bar, most nights this was not a problem as we listened to the live music till bedtime on the lanai. But one night we arrived back to our room at about 9:30 after a stargazing trip up Mauna Kea (a must!) and noticed and heard a large party happening at the Bar. This surprised us because normally the whole resort is dead quiet about this time as all the fun in the sun makes people go to bed super early. Soon this lovely group of people was singing karaoke (without a machine...ohhhh sweeeetttt carrooollinnnne...) and whooping and whooing like a bunch of California housewives. We could hear this noise across the pool, over the ocean, over the television and then once we closed our doors, over the AC. This continued till midnight despite me calling to complain around 11. We were exhausted the next day from lack of sleep.    Alas, the bar was actually closed so we are guessing that considering how well this large group of people was getting along (most guests seem stick to themselves) and that booze was coming from somewhere other than the closed bar, that it was another business event. This sort of boozing and partying normally seen at Cancun is not normal here. This place is for families and couples and having these business groups took something away from our experience. We happily paid a small fortune for this trip and booked almost a year in advance because we were that excited. Thus losing one night of perfect sleep is a big deal. And not being able to fall asleep with our doors open so we could listen to the ocean was also a big deal considering we live in a very busy and loud concrete jungle and need this small escape.    I suggest that if you want to avoid all of these ""distractions"" ask to stay in the outer crescents (King’s Pond or the Palm Grove Pool) that do not feature late night dining/drink options. This will result in a complete lack of awareness of your surroundings and you will simply be dripping in happiness, practically drooling into your mai tai. Sounds crazy but it is completely attainable here.    Now on to a few more details…    Beach Tree Bar food was okay but we tried several of the pastas at dinner and were not impressed. The lunch service seemed better than dinner in terms of food quality. For dinner - make reservations. You will walk up at 5:30 to see the place completely empty for them to tell you, oh sorry we are fully booked for the evening. Really?    The poolside food was really yummy in each area. Try the Mahi Mahi tacos and the onion rings for sure. Pahu i`a was great especially because since our last visit the menu got more creative. The small plates, particularly the steak and eggs, were to die for and the service was very warm and friendly. We ordered room service on several occasions, best room service food ever. Try anything and it will be amazing.    The new adult pool was very relaxing and the shave ice with liquor was a nice change of pace from normal tropical drinks. No one seemed to realize this pool was even there so it was crazy quiet every day. Go before someone else notices it!    My husband and I had a dual massage in the luxury couples hale. To die for. The massage was heavenly. Every staff member at the spa and salon did their job to perfection and were lovely to chat with. Our room rate, a spa voyage package, included five 50-minute spa treatments which was a great deal, and it looks like it is still available. It’s worth it. Tip is even included for some reason!    In the end, the place is heaven. I want to move in. Just be aware of your room location if you want complete silence and relaxation.",Jun 2011,June 2011,Traveled as a couple,,Chicago

110952971,50,Spoiled silly!,"As someone who has never stayed at a Four Seasons, this particular resort has set the bar high for any other properties I might visit. At first I was a little hesitant about the price, but my companion, who had stayed at the Hualalai before, urged me to pick this place. I'm really glad we did. The service, rooms and amenities were downright amazing and I left feeling like I got more than I paid for.    First, the service. Starting at check in, we got a personal lei/Mai tai greeting and a leisurely half-hour walkthrough of the resort services and layout. Throughout the rest of our stay, everyone was equally friendly. In the mornings at the gym, there was always someone walking around with cool towels and bottled water. The pool attendants were responsive and occasionally handed out cute freebies like Otter Pops or small cocktails. Housekeeping came around twice a day for clean up/turn down. We got a fresh bowl of fruit in our room each morning and an activity guide for the next day at nigh. Housekeeping also paid an amazing amount of attention to the details, like leaving sunglass cleaning cloths for us when they saw our smudged sunglasses.    The rooms are gorgeous. It's hard to imagine that the property was affected by March tsunami. We lucked out with an immense suite with a partial ocean/golf view, which had 2 patios (immaculate), 2 bathrooms (one with a steam shower), a fridge (with complimentary cream/milk and bottled water), coffee making items, flatware/barware, 2 flatscreen TVs, kimono robes and slippers, and many other luxurious touches. We had no problem with noise and we were able to park directly in front of our suite.    Finally, the amenities. The site is expansive, lush and feels really secluded, and there are many activities available. I loved the gym, which has an open area for mat work, 3 separate roofed areas for classes, cardio and weights, a lap pool, climbing wall and tennis court. At the spa, massages are done in peaceful outdoor cabanas and the spa facilities are extensive. But the property's pools were my outright favorite. We spent a lot of time in one of the cabanas at the quiet adults-only pool (there's an even quieter adult pool with a swim-up bar on the premises, but that one had no real shade) just napping and getting waited on all day :). Another nice pool is the semi saline Kings Pond, which has several varieties of sea life and gets around 20 ft deep. Snorkeling gear was provided. We even helped feed the resident eagle ray, which is 10 shades of awesome in my book. There's also a place from which you can arrange ocean snorkeling, paddle boarding, and other ocean activities.    In general, the restaurants are good, albeit a bit expensive. If you're there for only a few days, they will be absolutely fine...otherwise, you may want a vehicle so that you can venture out to Kona for some other options or to hit up a grocery store.    In summary:    PROS:  - Friendly staff  - All the small perks--water stations, sunscreen at the pools, fruit bowls in the room, treats that get handed out if you hang around in one place for a little while, etc.  - Immaculate, large rooms  - Quiet  - Several pool options  - Ocean access  - Free self parking  - Attentive housekeeping  - Relaxing spa services  - Large, extensive gym  - Wildlife visible (sea turtles, quail, fish)  - Great landscaping and views, with lots of photo opportunities  - Gas, store, to-go food and restaurants onsite    CONS:  - Charge for Internet. It's not terrible, but with all the other small perks, you'd hope this would be one of them.  - Restaurant choices might get stale over an extended period of time  - The cost :)    Pro tip: To really maximize your relaxation, time, and money, don't schedule a ton of off-site excursions while you're there. Driving around takes time, and you'll find you won't want to leave once you get there.",Jun 2011,May 2011,Traveled as a couple,,"Sydney, Australia"

109630349,50,Another excellent review,"Just returned from a wonderful stay. I will avoid redundancy -- and say, in short, this place is truly spectacular and lives up to the reviews others have written recently. Superb service, gorgeous beach and grounds, excellent food and rooms. We were there 2 weeks after it re-opened and it looked really verdant and pristine.    A couple of tips: 1) there are laundry services with free washer/dryer and soap near each cluster of rooms. We packed a lot of stuff for a one week stay but since we were able to do our own laundry we only needed half of it (the hotel will wash for you but it is costly);    2) when booking ahead, I suggest asking whether any large tour groups are at the resort. We arrived in the midst of a rather boisterous tour group. The resort staff did the best they could to meet the group's expectations (drinking and fraternizing) as well as the other private vacationers, but at times it was louder than I would have liked. We found the management very receptive to our grousing and they made a good effort to keep the overall noise level down;    3) dinner on the beach was one of the best experiences I have ever had with my partner.

We have been staying at fairly high end resorts all over the Carib and in Hawaii, as well, so we decided to go to the one island we hadn't seen yet and...why not? Four Seasons.    From the second you get there, the staff knows your name. They knew our anniversary date and helped us celebrate with champagne. Wherever we went, we were greeted in the most friendly manner AND many (if not most) of the folks we encountered knew exactly who we were and greeted us BY NAME. The STAFF is what makes this experience the BEST.    The room was AMAZING, the bed comfortable, the bathrooms spacious and luxurious with that 'spa' feel. There are little appointments everywhere to make you feel welcome and to convenience you in every way. Housekeeping even went so far as to arrange our books and put little bookmarks in each one. It's the little things like that that make such a great impression.    The food was great, the prices were what we expected, King's Pond was awesome...everyone make sure to try Pass the Bucket - a refreshing lime cocktail!    The only thing we didn't care for? Well, besides having to leave? You can hear your neighbors. It was blissfully quiet for the first few days of our stay, but the last three mornings, we were awakened by noisy neighbors...guess the rooms around us must have been empty before (or we had quiet neighbors).

The Four Seasons Hualalai did the opposite - going to the poolside with the kids we were surprised to find free beach toys, free sunscreen, free shaded cabanas, free shaded dech-chairs by the beach, free boogie-boards to learn swimming etc.    The food is delicious, fresh, local, and healthy.

Make sure you book a room on the ground floor...not only is access to the gardens, pool and beach easier, but they have amazing outdoor volcanic showers!    The service was perfect throughout the resort...all staff in every area were attentive to our every need and soooo nice to our kids! Every now and then we would be surprised with what I called ""superior service surprises"" for example, whilst lying by the pool ""sir...can I clean your sunglasses?"", or ""would you like a spray of Evian for your face?""....just amazing!!

Resort facilities are great...I saw some reviews that complained about the lack of pure sand beach areas....not an issue...there is a great sandy beach right in front of the resort where you swim with sae turtles and many types of reef fish...just great!

Whatever reason you come to this resort for, you will find it here. Perfect for families, or a romantic getaway. Downside, not many, but I will say that I was kind of surprised the FSH opened back up with still so much damage to the property. The eco system part of the property is in terrible shape, which is expected, but again I was surprised they didn't have it in better shape than they did. I saw a lot of garbage and random debris. For example, a washed up boat. Just expected the grounds to be a bit cleaner, seemed like they may have rushed the opening. Besides that, nothing but positive things to say. Also, salon is great.

There was never a need that they did not try to anticipate ahead of time or if we mentioned it...they immediately acted.

It was very difficult to leave the tranquility of this resort.  Dining- everyting from room service to the restaurant were fabulous.

I could never say enough about Pahu i`a from the food, service and beautiful views.  The spa was wonderful. Truly rejuvenating in every way and one of my favorite in the U.S.  Concierge went above and beyond helping my husband arrange special surprises, such as a private dinner by the ocean with tiki torhces...it took my breath away.....to a private sail with a catered luncheon just for the two of us.

100057204,50,Incredible location is only bested by the service ethic,"Our trip was unfortunately cut short by the tsunami, but we experienced enough in a short period of time to know this place is special.    The location and property are simply stunning, but that's obvious from the pictures. What is less obvious is the extent to which everyone working there will go out of their way to help. The service ethic is truly special, both when things go well and when things go badly.    The manner in which the hotel evacuation was handled during the tsunami scare was quite incredible. Those on duty and those who weren't but who came to help were solely concerned with the comfort and wellbeing of their guests.    I only hope we can make it back one day to fully enjoy this resort.",Mar 2011,March 2011,Traveled as a couple,,"New York City, New York"
99842835,50,Unprecedented Quality and Service,"There are so many positive reviews for this hotel I didn't feel the need to pile on. The hotel is wonderful. It's a beautiful resort in a beautiful location. It's spread out over a 38 acre campus so it's quiet and you have a feeling of peace and solitude. There are at three different pools to enjoy, including a unique salt water manmade ""fish pond"" that recreates a natural lagoon with hundreds of fish and an eagle ray. You can spend all day there relaxing in the sun and communing with nature. There's a huge fitness complex with a beautiful lap pool, tennis courts, a basketball court, and a climbing wall. And the level of service in the hotel is amazing. This was one of our favorite stays anywhere.    All of these points have been made before on TripAdvisor and I wouldn't have bothered to add to the list. But on March 10th a devastating earthquake in Japan caused a tsunami warning to be triggered in Hawaii, and the Four Seasons Hualalai had to be evacuated by government orders. Then I really saw what a tremendous hotel is.    The warning was announced at 10pm at night. The hotel staff started notifying guests and within an hour buses arrived to evacuate us to a private golf clubhouse higher up in the hills and out of danger. Several hundred people were orderly moved to this new location and the Four Seasons staff remade it as our new home for the evening. Thousands of bottles of water were delivered. A late night snack buffet materialized. Cots were brought in for the elderly. A fleet of cribs, gallons of milk, and carton after carton of diapers were there for the guests with young children. TVs were setup and turned to local TV so we could follow the tsunami story. Most of us had to make do with beach towels as makeshift mattresses, but the hotel staff went around all night asking repeatedly if we were okay, was there anything we needed, were we hungry, etc.? The turned off the lawn sprinkler system so people could camp out on the grass. Extra staff, in their own civilian clothes, showed up in the middle of the night to relieve the first crew.    Civil defense had still not given the all-clear at dawn, so a full breakfast buffet was set up at 7am, complete with coffee, juices, and live music. Finally by 8am it was determined that the hotel had been damaged by the tsunami and we wouldn't be able to continue our stay. They passed out a masterfully written letter that clearly laid out our options. We could be moved to another Four Seasons property in Hawaii, for which they would actually arrange charter flights to the other islands at their expense. Or they would book us in competing hotels on the Big Island if we preferred. Or we could just go home. In any case, everyone would get their previous days' stay for free.    They set up a triage system so all the guests could meet with staff to make the necessary arrangements. That itself took hours so they set up more food for us to eat while we waited, opened the clubhouse pool for those guests with swimsuits, and even brought in a team of masseuses to give massages under the coconut trees until our new accommodations were booked.    Here's a company that cared so much about service that they kept feeding us, entertaining us, and tending to us, at their expense, when they knew they were out one day's fees and that they were simply helping book us at their competitors' resorts.    Besides the tsunami, the one thing all the guests were talking about was how well managed this whole process had been, and how we couldn't wait to come back to the Four Seasons Hualalai.    Yes, it sustained some minor damage from the waves but I expect they'll be open for business again in a few days or weeks. I can't recommend the property enough. It's a great place with a great management team.",Mar 2011,March 2011,Traveled as a couple,,"Ann Arbor, MI"
99711208,50,Expensive - But Incredible!!!,"This is by far the BEST & most luxurious resort ever!! - But of course it comes as at a price.    We had a fantastic stay here on our honeymoon in Feb 2011. We were provided with complementary champagne & chocolate plate in our room - staff at the resort really go the extra mile to ensure your stay is special.    The resort facilities are incredible. The pools are fantastic - the kings pond is a highlight you can go snorkeling and swimming in this man made reef and view tropical fish & rays. If your into golf they have a 1st class course in the resort as well as tennis courts, rock climbing, gyms & pretty much anything you can think of.    One note - it is very expensive to eat here & because the resort is very isolated unless you have a car there are no alternatives (taxi to the nearest shopping mall/restaurant is approx $40 one way). I would advise hiring a car if you are planning to stay here otherwise you will be confined to the resort which isn't a bad thing but if you want to sight see a car is a must. Definitely take a helicopter tour of the island & volcano - its the best way to see the island & you will see sights that you just cant on land.

Their attention to detail is truly impressive without being pretentious or uncomfortable.

95844067,50,Not inexpensive but worth every cent,"We rarely get away, so we decided to spoil ourselves with a fortnight vacation in Hawaii, staying on the Big Island (Hawaii), Kauai and Oahu. Our first stay was at the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai at Historic Ka'upulehu. I did balk at the price - but very pleased we took the plunge.  On arrival we recieved an upgrade which was lovely. The room was large and luxurious as expected (Oceanview across the grounds). The service was very kind and thoughtful. A minor running water sound from the apartment above (we thought someone had left the tap on) led to a call to front office - who offered to move our room if we wished as the water could not be turned off - we were unfazed and advised we were happy where we were (couldn't hear it unless door to ocean was closed). Went to one of the many pools to return to the room later where management had left complimentary drinks and snacks to apologise for the inconvenience - no need but the thought sets the tone of our experience. We made a conscious effort to get out and about to see the sights of the Big Island (which are spectacular) but could have easily drifted from day to day at this gorgeous resort. If you like golf the course looked superb (better half's hand was in plaster so ruled us out). Everything you could want was on offer. Thoroughly relaxing stay. Must check out the King's pool - basically a reef with fish to swim amongst. Highly recommend.",Feb 2011,December 2010,Traveled as a couple,,OverseasTravel2
95833098,50,2nd Visit--Still My Favorite Resort,"I do not claim to be an expert on the world's hotels and resorts. Howver, I have stayed at most of the nicer resorts resorts on Kauai, Maui and the Big Island and the Four Seasons Hualalai is the best of the bunch to my taste. Everything is beautiful, virtually everything is well planned and executed, and the service is great without being obtrusive. The only negatives are that the rooms are not as soundproof as they should be, the setting exceeds the quality of the food in some cases (but the setting is about as good as it can be), and nothing (that isn't included) comes cheaply. It also may not be the best place to take a family if they are hoping to spend a lot of time in the ocean (your going to need to drive to go body boarding or do much snorkeling outside of the King Pond) or are looking for waterslides etc. If you can afford it (and I barely can), you cannot do better than this. Both times we have stayed there, we have spent a few days elsewhere doing activities (i.e. volcano, Place of Refuge, snorkeling etc,) and then checked into the Hualalai and pretty much stayed put.",Feb 2011,November 2010,Traveled on business,,Salt Lake City/Utah
95503587,50,Perfect honeymoon!,"We spent the last 7 days of our honeymoon at 4S Haualalai and it was truly a special ending to a very important time in our lives. We came from The Grand Hyatt in Kauai which we didn't want to leave because we couldn't imagine it getting any better, well, it did. From the time Camille checked us in until the time we left everything was simply amazing. Just to know how wonderful the service is I thought that I had left my Ipod there when I got to the airport and Camille immediately had security go check & was ready to bring it to me at the airport however they couldn't locate it. I found it in a bag when I got home but Camille and hotel security was still following up with me three days after we returned.    The hotel was not at full capacity while we were there and we were upgraded to a 1st floor room around the adult pool. This is where you want to be! There were children in the room next to us but that didn't bother us at all. The lava shower is so wonderful! I absolutely loved that bathroom!!! Housekeeping was fantastic! They not only cleaned the room three times a day, they folded our clothes! They even offered to pack for us when it was time to leave. Great service all around!    We had breakfast most mornings at Pahuia which was yes, expensive but delicious. The buffet really offers items that other's don't such as the freshly squeezed vegetable juice and caviar cream cheese. On two mornings we did drive into Kona and had a great breakfast at The Fish Hopper right near the pier. It was a nice break ($12) from our $90 breakfast at Hualalai and it was really good. You can also walk right out to the trading post at the hotel and grab coffee and breakfast sandwiches there for a very reasonable amount. We ate every dinner at The Beach Tree because we loved it. I'm not a huge red meat person however I ordered the rib eye three nights in a row. We had picked up some good champagne (for less money than we'd pay at home) while in town to drink on the beach at sunset. The Icey Berries drink from the pool is the best frozen drink I have ever had. It's worth the $19, try it! Yes, this place is expensive but it's the 4S and it is all inline with the cost of the rooms.    My husband played 2 rounds of golf and raved about the course. I took paddle surfing lessons which are given at the hotel down the beach. It's not the easiest walk because the walkway ends at the 4S and you have to walk the beach the rest of the way. I found $120 to be a bit pricey although you can go back and use the boards for the rest of your stay.    This is a fantastic hotel! I highly recommend it. The only problem is we are now hooked on 4S's! It's really hard to stay anywhere else.

93887349,50,Absolutely amazing. Already planning to go back.,"Our trip to the Four Seasons Hualalai was incredible. From the moment you are picked up at the airport, you are treated impeccably. Even check-in is pleasurable as you are greeted with warm towels and a drink. Every single staff member has a smile and is more than happy to help you. I've never come across a more friendly staff. The grounds are amazing and the black lava rock is nothing we'd ever seen before. The pool is divine but you should know that the beach isn't really for swimming. The beach bags in your room are a nice touch as is the sunscreen at the pool. The golf course is immaculate with magnificent views. I golfed the best I ever have! Even their golf bag tags are top-notch and not like cheap plastic ones other hotels give you. We never really adjusted to the time change so we were always the first ones at breakfast and looked forward to watching the sun rise while eating outside. It was our favorite meal of the day and we looked forward to the ""juice of the day."" Make sure you try the strawberries... amazing! My only complaints are that the food is not out-of-this-world but it is still very good and the makeup artist/hair stylist is not good at all. Just be prepared to do that all yourself if you are going for a special occasion. We had such a great time that we are going back in April and bringing our two young children with us. There were quite a few families with young kids at the resort, and every single child was well-behaved!

The food was better, and the grounds were awesome. They have a very nice quiet pool for adults to relax and enjoy the view of the ocean.

The resort area is really huge and the rooms are located in separate builings so even during high seasons there are not many other guests around. We felt really private and completely relaxed.  The staffs were amazing and the room was just wonderful!!  Another specialty is their cultural center. Even adults can participate in 'Ukulele- or Hula-lessons for free and can personally learn about Hawai'i's culture. The staff at the cultural center are exceptional warm, welcoming and gentle people.

91051845,40,Beautiful Property. Great Vacation for the Adventurous,"We stayed the week before Christmas for a romantic, relaxing, much needed vacation. We usually go to the Caribbean, but we were tired of the long flight, so-so customer service and general stuffiness typical of those 5 star resorts, so we opted for the Big Island. Our spacious, ocean prime suite was located in the King's Pond area which we felt had the best view, especially at night when the tiki torches were lit. We were concerned about the noise level with kids snorkeling in the pond, but that was never an issue. Prices were a bit steep for food and beverage, even compared to other 5 star luxury resorts. You must have the ahi burger at the Beach Tree, even in LA where we get great, fresh ahi, this stood out as the ""best I ever ate""!    We did the helicopter tour of the entire island (thrilling), ATV riding through the Waipio Valley (fun!) and fishing with Fire Hatt charters (caught a 502 lb Marlin!). We enjoyed all three activities booked through the concierge. As others have mentioned, the beach isn't calm, shallow white sand, so instead we found ourselves getting out and exploring the natural beauty of the island and when the weather was not cooperating, we worked out at the resort's top notch athletic facility. Loved not having to miss my spin class!    Did notice toward the tail end of our stay, 2 days before Christmas, the families started flooding in. If you’re looking for peace and quiet I would not recommend coming at that time. The spa was beautiful. However, since when is it ok for people to bring crying babies and screaming 7 year olds into the spa? Would have appreciated the staff stepping in before the baby began crying in the relaxation area of the spa.    All in all though a great trip, fantastic service, and gorgeous surroundings.

90954851,50,The Perfect Relaxing Vacation,"This resort is one of those places you can't just describe in words, you truly have to experience it for yourself! The property is stunning! The views of the ocean, the lava rocks, and perfectly manicured lawns is unlike anything I've seen. The rooms are beautiful. We had a view of the King's Pond.    The staff is beyond accommodating. They spoiled my husband and me to the point that we got used to that standard of service and when we left we expected everyone to fall over us like the Four Seasons staff. My husband and I did not want to leave! We did, however leave at the perfect time; right before the holiday vacation rush when everyone drags their kids to the resort. I love that there is a kids pool and then a quiet pool. There seems to be plenty to do for the kids who visit the resort but it's such a beautiful place to go and appreciate it as a couple.    They do have beaches with great cushioned chairs with separate ""umbrella"" type covers. The sand, however, is very coarse, and not like the powder sand in Maui. But the views at the beaches are just as amazing.    The spa is breathtaking! The most amazing part of the spa is the relaxation garden. I didn't want to leave. I highly recommend the coconut hibiscus bath that includes a scrub and a massage.  The one ""wish"" I have is that the salon carried a different hair product line. I'm a huge fan of Kerastase and I wish they carried that line or something equivalent.    The gym is unlike any hotel gym. There is a lap pool, rock climbing wall, basketball court, tennis court, a weight room with dumbbells that go past 50 lbs (my husband told me), a room of treadmills and ellipticals, not to mention all the instructed classes. They do charge for classes but it's a similar price as any classes you'd pay for at a local gym. I took a spinning class that was amazing!    The 2 restaurants at the resort were phenomenal. There was a enough menu selection to keep us happy going to the Beach Tree for 3 nights.    There is a laid-back, less pretentious vibe at this resort (in comparison to Wailea) that makes this a truly relaxing, yet extremely indulgent vacation. The staff is not only the epitome of efficient, helpful, and accommodating; they are genuinely friendly.    I believe anyone who is not happy here, will never be happy.

89619687,50,Amazing Honeymoon,"Came here on the second leg of our honeymoon from Four Seasons Maui. Had high expectations and even these were surpassed by this hotel. First of all, the spread out bungalow style rooms and multiple pools / hottubs make this resort feel so private and exclusive. Totally different than the Maui property, which is gorgeous but has a crowded mega-resort feel unlike this place. Much like Maui, the service is amazing and what really differentiates the hotel. People are at the pool to bring you ice water, sunblock, sunglass cleaning, avion spray, smoothie and shots of the day, pinapple, etc. The beachtree bar and grille is the best place I have ever been for a beachside lunch and dinner - no exaggeration. For lunch, sit at the bar with an amazing view of the ocean/sunset and try the amazing Mahi Tacos or lobster sandwich. At night. try the lasagne and lobster ravioli. In the evening there is live local music. The atmosphere is incredible. I normally like to eat at a few different places on vacation, but this place is such a gem we ate here 3 nights. The Hualalai golf course is incredible - surpasses the nicest I have seen in the NY and NJ area. My wife drove the cart while I played. We were the only people on the course which was amazing. The gym is nice - has its own buildings for cardio, weights, yoga, plus basketball and tennis. My wife convinced me to try the spa, which was also great. She raved about some mud/seaweed treatment. We rented a convertible and drove to Waipea Valley. Do the hike down to the beach with black sand. The scenery feels like something out of the movies. The hike back up is painful for 30 minutes but you will have a once in a lifetime memory. We drove 30 mins to a place called Merrimans for dinner one night which was good. On Saturday nights, there is a beachside cookout on property at Pahua which was delicious. They also do a weekly manager's reception at sunset where they have some light appetizers and drinks to meet some other guests and staff (from houskeeping to the property manager - everyone is so friendly).    Highlights: Service as mentioned is impeccable. The beachtree bar and grille. If you enjoy eating great food on the beach listening to some good music, you will love this place. The serenity pool is great. Golf amazing. The entire resort is amazing.    Downsides. Long flight from NY. The bill when you leave is painful, but you know that going in. The beach is not really for swimming, and we heard someone got stung by a sea urchin on the rocks so be careful.

The best part about the property is that it does not in any way feel like a hotel. The ""rooms"" are all nestled into the topography of the island and offer a very personal and private experience. At first, we thought we may be too far when booking a golf/ocean view, but it was ideal. Be sure to request a room with an outside shower. The outside shower is your own private oasis constructed of lava rock and is a wonderful addition.    The bed linens are fantastic and they play beautiful Hawaiian music softly during the evening.

88481242,50,Our First Visit - Definitely Not our Last. Worth Every Penny.,"We had been long overdue for a couple's vacation and were celebrating a special anniversary this year. Having had decent stays at the RItz Carlton Kapalua and at Kanaapali in Maui my husband was skeptical of trying something different but the rave reviews here and elsewhere were totally justified. After our stay at Hualalai he (and I) are totally hooked. We can't wait to return. While no resort is totally perfect (as other reviewers have commented, so will we) this one comes pretty darn close.    Positives:  -We requested an oceanfront room and were upgraded to an oceanfront suite at the ""adult"" pool area (I had made a point to tell the concierge several weeks prior that we preferred to avoid families and wanted a quiet location). Sure enough, we had a fantastic view from our bedroom and living room and a short walk to the pool/beach. Not once in six days did we experience any noise issues in our room or by the pool in the spacious cabana areas. We were surprised at the number of families onsite given it was not a holiday week, but this thankfully didn't impact us since there's plenty of space and activities for kids as well within the resort.  -The adult pool was terrific - perfectly heated, impeccably clean and totally deserted in the AM when we wanted to swim laps. We had it virtually to ourselves and even in the PM it was not very crowded or noisy. Poolside attendants are super-attentive and helpful.  -While the beach area is not huge, it is certainly adequate for a dip. Watch for sea turtles!  -Service is top notch, friendly and unobtrusive in all areas. We did not encounter the tipping suggestions or aloof servers noted in other reviews. Nor did we mind dodging the golf carts used by servers within the resort - they were all super-friendly.  -The Saturday evening buffet is not to be missed - if you're thinking steam tables at the Holiday Inn, think again.  -The morning breakfast buffet, while pricey, is also high quality with amazing variety. We never needed to consider lunch but the yogurt/smoothie bar near the pools was a nice alternative. Local coffee tasting and coffee service for walk-away was also a nice touch.  -:Little touches, including large size L'Occitane toiletries, poolside sunscreen, luxurious towels, laundry facilities and endless water bottles when requested free of charge.  -There are many daily activities, cultural and otherwise, to take advantage of onsite most of which are free of charge.  -The room service menu and service (for us, anyway) is way above average  -This really is a place you don't need a car (unless you want to venture to other Big Island destinations) and can pretty much kick back from the time you arrive. It's also a very convenient 15 minute ride from the Kona airport. We appreciated not having to pay (if you self park) for parking our rental car but next time, will use a taxi or limo service.    Liked less:  As others have noted, there's really not much near the resort worth driving to, especially restaurants, so you're limited to the two hotel choices and room service. While we adored the hotel buttets, we were less enamored of the Beach Cafe ""Mediterranean"" dinner menu (heavy on pastas, pizzas and Italian dishes like osso bucco which seemed out of place) and found the Pala'u formal (and very expensive) dinner venue with its limited Asian-seafood menu less inviting. For us. the room service menu was the best option for a more casual ""American"" evening meal but that might not be your cup of tea.  -Also, we would have appreciated being able to provide a group tip since we found ourselves running out of small bills on a regular basis. Next time, we'll ask.  -The spa/massage service was nothing special and overpriced. I would skip next time.  -Finally, you would think they could throw in free Internet service - how about it?    But all in all, we had a wonderful time, and will definitely be back. Highly recommended.",Nov 2010,November 2010,Traveled as a couple,,Washington State
88032636,50,Excellent Honeymoon,"We stayed here for 4 nights/5 days in October at the end of our honeymoon following a week on Maui. We absolutely LOVED this hotel. In fact, we originally were only going to stay 3 nights and extended our stay. Our original room was on the second floor on the Beach Tree crescent. We had a nice ocean view and the room was extremely convenient as this was our favorite pool area. Since we extended our stay one night, we had to change rooms since our room was already booked for that night. To make up for the inconvenience, they upgraded us to a suite at the King’s Pond area. This was a little farther away, but we had a closer view of the ocean here. I really think anyone would be happy at any area. The suite had 2 full bathrooms and a separate living room with a larger balcony. We did not have the famous lava outdoor shower since both our rooms were on the second floor. We did have lovely ocean views from both rooms which I’m not sure you’d get on the first floor. There are outdoor showers at the spa which I utilized. Of course, they aren’t “private”, but they are there. Personally, we’d rather have ocean views.    POOLS: We spent most of our time at the Beach Tree pool. This is the “quiet” pool. Cell phone use is discouraged. Children are allowed I believe, but must be quiet. I didn’t see any children here when we were there. There were a few well behaved children at the Sea Shell pool. There were always chairs available even when we slept late or came to the pool late after visiting sites. The service was excellent. Someone often came by to offer a smoothie, or Evian spritz, or popcicle, or sunglass cleaning. They bring lunch out on little trays, so you can remain lounging on your chaise while eating. They also have suntan lotion and magazines or books available for you to use while at the pool. We also snorkeled at the King’s Pond. Snorkeling gear is free to use. This is a great way to snorkel if you are at all nervous – no waves and no sharks!! We had an underwater camera and got some great shots of fish and the ray. We went into the ocean also and saw a turtle! This area is quite quiet with lots of chairs and private areas. There are marine biologists there to answer questions about the fish. We happened to be there when they were feeding the fish one morning and were able to feed some fish also – fun!    RESTAURANTS: We enjoyed all of our meals that we had at the Beach Tree (more casual) restaurant. We had the breakfast buffet a few mornings and it was quite good with an omelet station and waffle station. We also had room service breakfast a few nights – they actually make the toast in your room so that it’s fresh! We also had room service dinner and it was very good and hot. I believe they have an oven in their cart to keep your food hot. We had dinner one night at the upscale restaurant (I think it’s Pa’huia?). I was a little disappointed – I actually liked the Beach Tree better. Only con is that the food is quite expensive at the resort (as expected). There are not many other options for food unless you drive about 15 minutes away.    SPA: We had a couples massage and it was very nice. All of their rooms are in little huts outside – very tropical! They have a larger room for the couples services. I could have loved this spa if we hadn’t just been to the spa at the Grand Wailea on Maui – this just couldn’t compare. There is a small hot tub and cold plunge and a steam room. There are also outdoor lava showers for you to use (not private), as well as indoor showers. You are able to use the facilities even if you don’t have a spa appointment. We utilized this on our last day, as our flight didn’t leave until 10:30 at night.    GOLF: I’m not a golfer, but my husband played and really enjoyed the course. I rode along in the cart and it was a beautiful course. I can’t say much else. I believe the Mitsubishi Open is played here. I also read that only guests of the hotels or residents can play here.    Overall I loved the place. If I lived closer and had more money, I would come here a ton. There were several honeymooners here during our stay and it’s a perfect spot for that. It’s secluded, yet you can drive 15 minutes and be in Kona or Waikoloa. We took a helicopter ride from Waikoloa and it was a highlight of the trip. I will say when you are paying these prices, they should include internet for free. There is plenty of free self parking and it’s quite close. I’d highly recommend this hotel.",Nov 2010,October 2010,Traveled as a couple,,"Tampa, Florida"
86090262,40,Fabulous But Overpriced!,"We have been going to this resort for over 5 years and absolutely love it. The grounds are beautiful, the rooms are wonderful and the entire staff is extremely friendly. The service is impeccable, however be prepared to pay through the nose for the amenities and everything else! The room prices are quite high, and there are only 2 restaurants on the property both of which are extremely expensive. Additionally, if you want to enjoy a Martini be ready to pay at least $21.00 for it!! Food & Beverage costs at this hotel are ridiculous and really take the luster & enjoyment out of the stay. If we ever do back to this hotel I will say we will get a car so that we are not held hostage to the ridiculous costs.

84704458,50,Paradise!! So glad we stayed and can't wait to go again!!,I found this hotel to be superb!! The grounds were immaculate and so were the accomdations... our only complaint would be was that the bed had a dip in it.... For those of you looking to save some money on parking... you can self park in the same lot as where they valet the cars.. if you have them valet it for you it is $20/day. Internet is $14 day unless you get 5 days or more and then it is $12/day. the have free washing machines and dryers to use which comes in handy...    We fed the spotted eagle ray & saw lots of turtles!!    We came to relax and found that the hotel was well spread out... we stayed at the adult pool area as we didn't want to be near the kids pool. We stayed overlooking the kings pond and had a beautiful oceanview room.. we didn't have a lava shower but we didn't mind.

83256114,40,"Beautiful, quiet, relaxing resort","My husband and I recently stayed at the FS Hualalai. I will try to sum up things that may help someone make a decision as to whether to stay here or elsewhere on the Big Island. If possible, I would have given it a 4.5/5 stars.    The day we checked in, the resort was only at 65% occupancy. This was quite shocking as it was a week before the Ironman. Check - in was prompt with complementary beverage, lei, and short golf cart tour before being taken to our room.    First of all, the grounds are absolutely beautiful, lush, and immaculately maintained -enough said.    The workout facility is very nice/clean. Not crowded, plenty of treadmills, ellipticals, and cycles. Also has a very nice lap pool. We did not have any spa treatments, so I can't comment on the spa facilities. There is a small general store next to the gym and a coffee/juice stand. The paths surrounding the resort provide plenty of walking/jogging opportunities.    The rooms are spacious and clean. The furniture did show some wear and should be repaired or updated. We had a premium ocean view room on the second floor around the adult pool. I don't know if the lava showers that everyone raves about in the first floor rooms would be worth giving up the view that we had from our second floor balcony. The rooms around the adult pool are closest to the ocean, very quiet, and appear to have the best views.    On average, lunch and dinner at the Beach Tree is not as good or as consistent as at Ferraro's at the FS on Maui. I also found that the service seemed less polished and a little slower. It is open for lunch and dinner. I think the most disappointing meal during our stay was their Saturday night buffet at Pahu I' a. This is the only dinner we ate in this restaurant - sub par. You will do better to skip it. Breakfast was much better. We never had the breakfast buffet, only ordered off of the menu. The resort is isolated from other restaurants/resorts, so plan on driving if you want to dine elsewhere. News flash - yes, the restaurants are expensive, even for those of us from the Bay Area.    The beach is beautiful/rustic. Very relaxing. Not crowded. You do not have to get up at the crack of dawn to get chairs/cabanas around the pool or beach. FYI, this is NOT a swimmer's beach. There is too much lava and a rough surf. The beach is also very difficult to walk on due to slope and sand consistency. I knew this prior to making my reservations, but this may be a deal breaker for those of you who prefer the ocean to the pool.    To sum it up.... this is a beautiful resort to get away from it all. Beautiful grounds. Not crowded. Quiet beach/pools. The things that knock my rating down to a 4.5 are the restaurant inconsistencies, driving distance to other resorts/restaurants, and the crazy staff golf carts that you will be dodging on the walking paths around the resort.",Oct 2010,October 2010,Traveled as a couple,,California
83071294,50,One of the best Four Seasons,"The positive reviews already posted appear to have this remarkable property covered. Rates at this hotel are higher than at the other four seasons in the hawaiian islands but the premium appears justified. This is an understated and wonderful place to stay. The service is outstanding and the grounds are a man-made work of art wedged into a natural wonder.    I was greatly pleased by the spa as it showcases the natural beauty of the area. The service was expensive but excellent. The outdoor hot and cold plunge pools were awesome after a run around the property.    Fine dining around the world has become sort of homogeneous due to the availability of non-local ingredients but the dining room actually reflects premium locally sourced materials in a way unique to the island and not found elsewhere.    I'm planning a trip to four seasons punta mita in march 2011 and look forward to making a comparison, since the hualalai is considered by some to be the best four seasons hotel in the chain. A followup review will be placed on the punta mita entry on tripadvisor.",Oct 2010,August 2010,Traveled with family,,"Beaumont, Texas"
82657335,50,Does it get any better than this?,"We were greeted with leis and a cocktail at the reception area. We were then transposrted to our little slice of heaven by Dusty the trusty Bellman in his little golf cart. He was full of interesting information about the area as wll as the property.  The property has in fact been etched out of an 1801 volcanic eruption lava field.  If we wanted DVDs we could go and select from the library at reception, more tidbits from Dusty.  The room although quite removed form bar and eating areas was overlooking the King's Pond and then onto the beach. Adjacent is a hot tub. If you need to do laundry during your stay, w&D literally downstairs from our beautiful suite. Although we did not have an outdoor shower we had a beautiful suite with cathedra/plantation ceiling with a great balcony perfect for looking out to sea and enjoying the amazing amount of birds in the beautiful gardens undulating through the enormous property.  The King's Pond is stocked with approx. 2000 fish including a spotted ray. Snorkel and fins are provided if you chose to take a visit beneath.  One downside is there is very little in the immediate vicinity so a trip to another spot with restaurants varies from $30-$60. The food at the resort provided by various restaurants in cluding around the swimming pools but Not at the King's Pond is excellent.  At the King's Pond and the pools are 2 levels of SPF to protect yourself provided, a great supply of filtered water to stay hydrated. There is also an occasional visit by staff to either offer you a Freezie, clean your sunglasses or mist you with Evian water.  The staff were remarkable. They appeared when you needed them but otherwise kept a polite distance.

The Aloha vibe has returned with renovations to the property, wonderful customer service from top to bottom and an all around better atmosphere.    The only downside to the hotel currently is the loss of Alan Wongs. Without a doubt this was one of the best restaurants I had ever eaten out.

79586282,50,Wonderful Stay,"We spent five nights at the Four Seasons Hualalai and enjoyed every moment of our stay. This was our fourth trip to the Big Island so we planned to stay on-property, which turned out to be the perfect choice. We stayed in a premium ocean view room (second floor) in the King's Pond area, which is a great choice if you want to stay in a quieter part of the resort.    What we liked:  1. Excellent arrival: personal greeting at the airport; refreshments upon check-in; and mini tour of the property as we were escorted to our room.  2. Room: very clean and well-maintained; good-sized space with a nice balcony and view of the pond and ocean beyond; generously sized shower and separate tub; and very comfortable bed.  3. Property: The rooms are in two-story bungalows so there isn't a ""hotel"" feel to the property, which was very nice. The grounds were immaculate and just beautiful. The walking/jogging path along the ocean and through the property was perfect for early morning walks. The fitness center and spa facilities were good.  4. Restaurants: The coffee bar (next to the spa) was a great alternative to the breakfast at Pahui'a (nice pastries and fruit salad). That said, breakfast at Pahui'a was stunning, especially the setting (right next to the ocean) --- best way to start the day. The Beach Tree was good as well --- one night, there was a live band playing and the atmosphere there was really nice.  5. Pool service: Wonderful --- for the most attentive service, sit by the Beach Tree pool or the cabanas on the beach next to the pool. Wow.    What we didn't like as much:    1. The service at the spa could have been better. We have had more positive experiences elsewhere.  2. The dinner service at Pahui'a was not as polished as we expected given the caliber of the restaurant.  3. It would have been nice if the internet service was included.    Overall, we had a wonderful stay and would definitely go back on our next trip (but I would skip the spa experience).",Sep 2010,September 2010,Traveled as a couple,,"San Francisco, California"

We had a wonderful dinner with a table in the corner by the ocean. We walked the grounds in the morning after a fantastic breakfast on our patio.

I enjoyed the adult pool which is basically self serve. Main pool has more action and is staffed. Thought the dining venues were excellent and as usual for 4S, pricey.

77765081,40,Just Not Like it Used to Be,"I've been coming to Hualalai off and on for about 9 years now with my wife and children and after seeing descriptions like ""Amazing"", ""Spectacular"", ""Best Resort Ever"", ""Exquisite"", ""Perfection"", ""Heaven on Earth"" from other reviews compelled me to write my first review on Tripadvisor. If you haven't stayed at Hualalai before or other special places in Hawaii or on the Big Island for that matter I can understand the use of such descriptions but it's changed dramatically in the last couple of years and has become unfortunately just another high priced resort with an attitude or as my wife said ""It's Just Not Like it Used to Be.""    Valet - Perfection thanks to old timers that still take care of the cars and bags    Check-In - Perfection again but the juice and leis are becoming fairly standard    Grounds - Perfection especially at night    Beach - One of if not the worst beaches for any major resort in Hawaii unless you like choppy surf and lava rock. It's only good for the covered chaise lounges that sit on on the steep man-made sand berm. The protected beach is only usable during low tide for swimming, turtles and kids. You can go down to the state park or up to KVR but otherwise forget it, you might as well be in Hana. I go up to KVR to snorkel when I am at Hualalai (Kings Pond isn't snorkelling) and my kids spend all day on the beach (sand castles, ocean petting zoo, chasing fish, etc.) and in the ocean up the coast at another resorts condo area past Hawaii's own Disneyland. Not at Hualalai. This is not an ocean beach resort, not as bad as Disneyland up the road but close. This is a pool/activity resort.    Pools - Unique but overly crowded and under or unmotivated staff. Before the ownership change, the new suites, and the notoriety, they were perfect. Clean, plenty of space, Kings Pond ice cold beautiful with lava rock and sidewalks on fire and cabanas available at every pool, all 4 of them. A week ago (late Aug. and 1-2 weeks before school in SoCal) no cabanas, chaise lounges doubled around the pools, 2 eagle rays gone from Kings Pond, otter pop wrappers on the ground, out of towels in the afternoon and beds in Palm Cove, I might as well be in Vegas.    Rooms - Perfection if you get a ground floor unit, ""Partial Ocean View"" with a lava shower otherwise they are like any other but with bigger bathrooms. It's really not a special experience at the 4S Hualalai if you don't get a lava shower    Food - Alright but not spectacular and don't get me started about the $16 Mia Thai's at the pool or at the bars (the $22 Mia Thai at the Resident's Beach Club by comparison is still great). Pahu i`a - Go once for dinner and that's all you really need, Brunch hasn't changed in 9 years and is still great. Beach Tree - An upgraded design and menu but I miss the bar in the sand and the waits are unacceptable. The Grill has gone from Alan Wong to a a third rate sports bar (not 4S quality or even Hooters for that matter) and that is being generous. Do yourselves a favor and go down to the Members Beach Club sit in the blue chairs for a little bit and get lunch and/or dinner with an order of onion rings, the Hawaiian Pizza and a Mai Thai. If you want one meal at the 4S then it would be the Saturday night Buffet whether you are staying at the resort or not, still magical despite the fact that it has gone upscale at Pahu i`a and is no longer really in the sand.    Amenities - Nothing beats the cultural center for the young and old.    Staff Attitude - It's a tale of two staff types:  Old Timers at Valet, House Keeping, Security, Pahu i`a, Cultural Center = Perfection and still say Aloha at every turn  College Kids at the Pools, Beach Tree, Health Club = Next Question    Guest Attitude - Once upon a time this used to be a place where the guests including celebrities didn't have an attitude. Everyone knew that it was a special place and it was no big deal. Today it's more about how you dress, nannies/au pairs taking care of kids instead of their parents (isn't this why people go on vacation in the first place), not giving a crap about other guests, discussions about getting kids into Harvard/Westlake and how ""exclusive"" the resort is.    Would I recommend Hualalai for honeymooners, first-timers and the like, yes for a couple of nights but not more than that. For those of us old timers like topaccommodations, myself and the like there are other options on the Big Island and in Hawaii for that matter that can be just as nice for half the price. If you know the right condo or house to stay in on the Big Island then the 4S at Hualalai is a 1 or 2 night treat at the end of a week with late checkout before the red-eye home. It's better than the 4S Maui for most, not as cramped as the rooms on Lanai but it's not perfection, the true magic is gone.",Aug 2010,August 2010,Traveled with family,,"Bath, United Kingdom"
77759326,50,"Absolutely Flawless, it doesn't get better than this!","I have followed Trip Advisor reviews over the years but never took the time to post a comment. We are from Southern California and frequent Hawaii often. We have stayed at many high end hotels on Oahu, Maui, Kauai and the Big Island. Nothing compares to the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai. If you want to completely relax with absolute authentic Hawaiian beauty and with first class service this is it. The gym/spa is the best with its own 4 lane lap pool surrounded by beautiful work out rooms. We have taken Spin classes that are excellent and really appreciate the chilled towel they bring you towards the last 10 minutes  of your workout. Your every need is anticipated and everyone who works here generally loves it here and is beyond nice. No one has the forced smile or fake Aloha greeting, they really enjoy you and are wonderful.    The two restaurants are gorgeous and the food is great. Yes it is expensive but when you enjoy the many perks throughout the day it is well worth it.  At the pool you are kindly offered smoothies, water, evian mists, chilled washcloths and are even asked if they can clean your sunglasses all as a courtesy. I could write pages about this Hotel, bottom line - someone knows how to run a hotel WELL. It is over 90% full here but you wouldn't know it as it seems very private.  If you are looking for night life or lots of shopping or more of a ""scene"" don't come here. This is an elegant, beautiful, sophisticated hotel for those who wish to exercise, enjoy the best food and truly relax. Worth every penny and I congratulate the Four Seasons for respecting Hawaiian traditions and keeping it real, this is a really special place. I am now at the pool and it is sunset, stunning!

77290781,50,Stating the Obvious and What's Already Been Said: Amazing Hotel!!,"One has to be a little skeptic when so many people give such high marks for a hotel or restaurant on Tripadvisor. However, for the Four Seasons Hualalai, the high marks are well deserved.    First, I can definitely understand some of the negative marks when the hotel was under construction and renovation. I was not at this hotel when those things were going on and will not argue with the reviews that were during that time. However, with the renovations done, I strongly disagree with any negative reviews on this hotel. Granted, no hotel is perfect and there may be, the most likely rare, incidents where the hotel could not cater to the individual. But the overall experience of this hotel is nothing short of spectacular. The reason I see for the negative reviews would be individuals having closed minds and not wanting to open them simply because they are paying a lot of money for something. Simply put, if you are that type of individual who cannot get over paying alot of money for a hotel, then do not go here and spend your nights at a motel.    However, for those who treasure the experience with an open mind and believe you get what you pay for, then I highly recommend the Four Seasons.    We were greeted first with a cold fruit drink with a lay. Then given a tour around the enormous resort in a gold cart. The resort is huge with over four pools and the beach. They have gone to the extent of making a wave break around their area so the waves are small and makes for easy enjoyment. The pools run from kiddie pools to the adult pool and cater to all individuals. They have small huts were you can lay down and relax and take a nap if you wish. Of course, being the Four Seasons, it comes with the water sprays, fruit, cucumber for the eyes, etc. And one thing deserves mentioning.. as with Maui Four Seasons, you do not have to rent a cabana or the hut. It is first come first serve and included in the rates. Many hotels will charge for renting a cabana. Sea Turtles will come right up the shore and great for those pictures to take home.    The Paia restaurant is excellent. The buffet breakfast is great with so many things to choose from. Only the Maui Four Seasons out does the buffet breakfast here. Unfortunately, this buffet does not have a pancake making station but only an omelet bar. Dinner at the restaurant is romantic where you are seated right in front of the ocean and the waves breaking on the rocks. The food is Four Seasons quality and nothing short of it.    So many things to write about, but all positive. Definitely, the best Four Season experience with its peacefulness and service.

75648461,50,Perfect destination for R&R,"Just returned from our 4-night stay at Four Seasons Hualalai. It was our 4th visit and it gets better each time. This time we booked a family package which includes breakfast, dinner and 1 family activities. Although the package price seemed very high at the time of booking several months ago, it was one of the better value deals we've had. We opted for a family canoe trip. As it turns out, the canoe trip is run by Kona Village resort, located next door to FS. As with everything else on the resort, the service and amenities were top notch and everyone had great time, especially snorkeling with dolphins.    What we like the most about Four Seasons Hualalai is the fact that once we're on the resort, we can completely relax and be pampered. We've been to other resorts where each time we turn we need to pay either for activities or other amenities. At FS, there is no one to nickel and dime you. From children's activities, laundry facilities, to feeding eagle rays, many amenities are already included in the room rate so you're not shelling out cash each time.    There are plenty to do for all ages (golf, tennis, pool, spa, rock climbing, ukelele lessons, hula lessons, bracelet making lessons, yoga - just to name a few). Then again, there are several pools to sit around and do nothing at all. We liked strolling around the resort and admire the gorgeous view, sweet fragrance of tropical flowers, and taking in the serenity of the resort.    It's hard to imagine anyone not liking this resort.

74939758,50,It was true Paradise,"We stayed at this hotel for our honeymoon for the second half of our trip. It was our first time in Hawaii and were unsure which hotel would be better suitable for the occasion. Let me start by saying that the other hotel did not even come close nor compare to Four Seasons by any means. From the moment you drive into the resort it is very relaxing. The landscapes are very beautiful. The grounds are being quietly kept at all times. As soon as we arrived to valet parking they already knew our names and that greeted us with DELICIOUS mai-tais in addition to fresh floral leis. Since we were an hour earlier than the check in time we were allowed given the option to go the spa to change into our swimsuits. We were not even changed when we were notified that our room was ready.    The BELL MEN drive around in golf carts and are always willing to take you were you need to go. We were given a quick tour of the entire facility which was great because it helped us get around.    Our ROOM was much, much smaller than the suite we stayed at prior, but not even the size made a difference. Our room was very nice and extremely comfortable and great to sleep in. It was up to date and well maintained. It had a nice size tube and a big shower with a great shower head. Then lanai was also just a perfect size for the two of us. We had a view of the pool, the beach, and the ocean. The room overall was great!!    The POOL was also nice to hang out at it was very relaxing and quiet. I believe they have a total of four pools including the kids pool and a Kings pond for snorkeling. We stayed at the quiet section of the resort since it was what we were looking for on our honeymoon. The other pools had much more ambiance if you are looking for a more active area.    The BEACH was great. Again we stayed on the quiet end and enjoyed the sand, sun, relaxation and full service. The staff on the beach was very helpful and tended to all and every need that we had weather we ordered anything or if it was just to bring us ice cold water to the very hot beach. They also have the main beach on the Beach Tree side which has more activities going on.    For FOOD, we were only able to try the Lava Lounge which had an incredible view of the beach at night. I think it was a little over priced for the value of the food and service.(2 people, 2 drinks each, 2 appetizers total bill $154 + $30 tip = $184)    ROOM SERVICE was very nice as well. We had chocolate covered strawberries the first day and they were so good we ordered them again. Not as great the second time. We also had the All American breakfast sent to our room which was delicious. It was very nice to have someone else cook breakfast and have it delivered to our for a change.    We reserved a ROMANTIC DINNER on the beach as well. It was our last dinner on the island I the best. It was very intimate and extremely romantic. We had tiki torches in addition to candles. We were picked up from our room and taken to the location of our dinner. We were greeted with very aromatic leis. They payed very close attention to detail even all the colors they used coordinated with each other. We had a private waiter whom was willing to take care of our every need. We were visited by the Manager himself to assure everything was okay. For the price we paid I would have expected a little more. But all in all it was the highlight of our trip.    All of the STAFF was very knowledgeable and willing to help at all times. This to us meant a great deal since the other hotel lacked it. Everyone here from the valet to concierge, to housekeeping and pool attendants were very gracious and kind.    I read in previous reviews that this resort was more or too expensive. Well let me tell you that it is, but every penny was worth it. If I could I would have only stayed here and enjoyed the entire trip during our honeymoon rather than having bitter experiences at the Hilton.

73453652,50,Tale of Two Hotels,"On this trip to the Big Island, I split my stay between the Four Seasons and the Fairmont Orchid. The Four Seasons definitely has nice rooms and the grounds are beautiful. If you prefer nice pools and nice rooms, stay here. The rooms are nice even by Four Seasons standards, and they are especially nice for families. The bugalow rooms that we stayed in allowed us to park our cars right outside and they had laundry facilities (very welcome on a 2 week vacation). My only problem were the prices. I expect 5 star hotels to be expensive, but some of the prices were bordering on annoying. For example, each glass of guava juice cost $7. Any adult drink will be $15+. Also, even the employees appeared embarassed about some of the activity prices, and there is this constant reminder that they recommend 20% tip on everything. The aquarium pool was cool, but I didn't want to stay in it too long - you could see sun lotion slick all over the surface. There is no snorkeling on the beach in front of the hotel and no boogie boarding because there is a restraining wall to keep the sand in the cove. By comparison, Fairmont Orchid has beautiful pools and fantastic snorkeling right off their beach. It is a much cheaper, but the difference is the rooms at the Orchid are dated and showing their age. I recommend this hotel to those who view money as no object and those who like sipping expensive drinks by the pool. I did not golf, but the course appeared to be quite beautiful.",Aug 2010,July 2010,Traveled with family,,"chicago,il"

We spent the last 3 nights of our 20th anniversary here, with the first 4 at the Kona Village Resort, which we also loved. The Four Seasons Hualalai captures the essence of romance, with their private outdoor grotto showers, soft music in your room upon returning from dinner and champagne, chocolate covered strawberries and banana bread on our corner room table. We requested the ""Palm Grove"" crescent for it's beauty and quietness and weren't disappointed.

70219273,50,In One Word: Perfection,"Yes, this hotel is expensive. Yes, this hotel is magnificent. Yes, this hotel is perfect (if you can afford it or if you get it as a wedding gift, like us!).    We taveled here for our honeymoon and were treated like royalty throughout our stay - and we are FAR from it! From the second you step off the plane, you can expect to be wowed by service, class and exceptional courtesy. Anyone who says the service isn't great is either mistaken or used to being waited on hand and foot and expects a free backrub along with the complimentary sunglass cleaning poolside.    Representatives from the hotel met us at the Kona Airport baggage claim, greeted us by name (how they knew, I have no idea - an educated guess, perhaps?) and told us to go get our rental car and they would take care of our luggage. We pulled up in our rental, they put the bags in the car and we were off on vacation in no time, flat. When we pulled up to the entrance, we were again greeted by name, and Mai Tais with fresh pineapple. They already had us checked in with a complimentary upgrade four tiers above what we had paid for and were off in a cart to tour the expansive property and go to our room. After the tour, we were welcomed with aloha to our temporary home with a bottle of champagne (which we saved for our last night and our romantic dinner at their restaurant). After settling in and exploring our room with outdoor shower (you absolutely MUST request a first floor room), we suited up and hit the beach and pool.    The next seven days pretty much went like this: wake up to birds singing and waves crashing, eat breakfast (we had the bed and breakfast package - two thumbs enthusiastically up), relax in the room, hit the pool/beach, eat lunch at the pool/beach, sleep/nap/read/swim/relax at the pool/beach, watch the sunset, eat dinner, sleep. Repeat.    A few tips: free coffee throughout the resort (lobby 6:30am - 8am, spa 6ish - 9ish, restaurant 6ish - 11ish), if you can swing it get a room at the King's Pond for a quiet and private place to stay, if you don't like to be woken up by birds or waves in the morning don't sleep with your windows/door open, the drinks are dangerously well made (and well liquored up) so drink with caution, and finally utilize the free amenities at the spa!    The rooms aren't cheap. The food isn't cheap. The drinks aren't cheap. If you are looking for a budget hotel, then look for a budget hotel - NOT the Four Seasons.

This year we brought our parents and young children. The staff went out of their way to accomodate our us. We would highly recommend their family dinners on the beach -- it was the highlight of the grandparents stay.    Our advice would be to visit the property during slower periods. While we have always had excellent experiences, we have found that the service (check in/out, housekeeping etc.) can fluncuate a bit when the resort is full.    This is our favorite resort to hang out and relax.

68776702,30,"Consistently Medicore Resort with a great pool, but nothing else to write home about","I have now stayed at this property three times over the last four years. in addition to other properties on the Big Island. This hotel - with few exceptions - does not render the level of service and resort experience one expects of Four Seasons or for the price tag. Three strikes and this hotel is out.    We dined two nights at the newly revamped Beach Tree. On both nights, service at the Beach Tree was exceedingly slow (about one hour for entrees to arrive) even if the food was fine. The Pahuia fine dining restaurant has not improved - and its food quality and service are slightly above average, but not on par with a resort of this supposed caliber. The Beach House - another casual dining option - is unimpressive in all respects. Again, other resorts on the Big Island have been dining options and service.    The Spa and fitness facilities are grand in scale and designed in part to accommodate those of the greater Hualalai resort community. The Spa, however, has always failed to deliver. The spa services themselves are average in quality. The separate men's and women's facilities at the Spa were not attended to and were generally dirty - with towels left everywhere. I did not see a single employee come into the facilities to make sure everything was in order and to pick up towels or replenish missing supplies in the two hours I was at the Spa. The Spa at the Four Seasons simply does not compare to the Spa at the Mauna Lani Bay Hotel.    The rooms are pleasant enough, comfortable, and designed in a stacked-bungalow style. (Our air-conditioning did not operate and it was a real hassle to change rooms). The bathrooms are generous in size and nice, but surprisingly fitted with run-of-the-mill shower -heads (no rain or overhead shower in the bathroom). Be forewarned that the vast majority of rooms are situated such that the hotel's ""back-house"" operations and buildings run parallel to the rooms themselves. Thus, there is a noise factor and unsightliness due to this design. The lanai to the room is fine, but not as good as those offered by the Mauna Kea Resort.    There is a small place to swim - but do not come here for the beach or beach related activity. The shoreline is rocky and does not lend itself to swimming. Other hotels on the Big Island - including the Hapuna, Mauna Lani, and the Mauna Kea boost beaches that are more swimmable, prettier, and certainly more enjoyable overall.    Really, the only good thing to say about this property is that it has an outstanding infinity pool and service at the pool is excellent. The front desk is also helpful. If what you want is simply to lay by the pool then this place will suit you fine. (But you can do that anywhere so I don't find this a real draw.)    So after three stays at this property, my opinion is that if you are looking for a true resort experience - one with fine dining, overall excellent service, and an outstanding spa - then do not stay at the Four Seasons. There are better options on the Big Island and this resort just does not merit your vacation time - or for that matter, your money.    Overall, three stars out of five.",Jun 2010,June 2010,Traveled as a couple,,"San Francisco, California"
68698698,50,breathtakingly beautiful.,Just spent two nights at this hotel and it is amazingly beautiful. The setting is fabulous. We had adjoining rooms facing the King Pond and they had wonderful views. We had chosen rooms with the golf/ocean view and were so glad to have upgraded. Our rooms were gorgeous and very comfortable. The beds are just so nice.  This hotel is famous for it's service and it deserves it's reputation. We felt really well looked after and all done with a smile. We were not crazy about the food and it was the only thing that would not make me want to stay there for a longer vacation. It is hard to rate the hotel for value as it is expensive but I expected it to be.

We live in Hawaii and have been from Europe to South America to Asia. This is a place to relax, enjoy the sun, beaches, and pools. The food is excellent!! There are 5 pools, lap pools, children pools, snorkeling pool, and private adult only areas. There are lots of walking paths by the beachs. Everything is set up in separate areas, so if you have children, they will be with others, whereas if you are a couple and want to be alone, you will not even hear the children area. The rooms are perfect, large, comfortable bed and pillows, occidental bath products, etc. The room was quiet. The service was there but not intrusive.    Everything is expensive here and we mean everything, breakfast for two is $80.00, lunch is $100.00, and dinner is $200-300. Spa services are also very expensive, double the cost of a high end spa anywhere else. So how to save $, you get an empty small refridge in the room, go buy food and drink at the local grocery stores, there is one at Queens shopping center and lots of shopping towards the city, Kmart, Target, etc. Rent a car, it is cheaper than the taxis or limo services provided.

Service was spectacular (my father had a strained neck and a on-call doctor took care of him right away; my son fell and bruised his knees and bandages and followup calls were made by concerned hotel staff for several days). Food was spectacular (from breakfast buffet to in-room service to pool service to night time restaurants) and all kids were given complimentary ice cream every day at the pool. The resort location is quiet and the guests are very civilized (a rarity nowadays even in high end resorts). Rooms are spacious and thoughtfully laid out. Conceirge work very hard and were even able to book a fishing charter with little notice.

Kona coast quite barren apart from where hotels have landscaped the grounds, but much sunnier than Hilo side, where it rained a lot. 4 seasons set in perfectly landscaped extensive grounds, with gofl courses and nice beach.  2 hours drive from HIlo - quickest (but not straightest) road is saddle road over the nountain - bit twisty but direct.

67409220,50,"Words can't describe the level of service and comfort. If you can afford it, stay here!","I could write pages and pages about how incredible this resort was. By FAR the best resort I've ever stayed at in my life. This was our second trip to Hawaii in 2 years, and honestly, the other resorts (including Marriott, Westin, and Hilton resorts) do not even compare.    The people here are so eager to serve you with whatever you need. Every single aspect of this resort was way above and beyond everywhere else. Curbside service with baggage upon arrival, lei greeting, private and personalized arrival service, check-in, poolside/oceanside service, complimentary sunscreen, ice water, fruit, twice daily room cleaning, concierge, water activities/snorkeling, even the bath soaps and lotions in the rooms were just incredible.    You name it, this place was better than everywhere else on all grounds except one: Price. Everything on the resort was expensive - including food at the resort restaurants. If you are on a very tight budget, you'll really need to go elsewhere for now or save for a time when you can splurge. You pay a lot here, but I think you absolutely get what you pay for. It might be 2-3 times more expensive than other places, but you will be so pleased with what you get here.    We especially loved snorkeling in the king's pond with all the beautiful fish.    Note: First floor units have an outdoor lava rock shower, but the lanai is ground level with a limited view. Second floor units have a balcony, most of which have a partial or full ocean-view - no outdoor shower on the second floor units, but the indoor shower was huge. We were thankful to have gotten a 2nd floor unit overlooking one of the swimming pools with a great ocean view.    One other hint - if you are planning on sightseeing on the island, I would plan to stay in another (cheaper) resort while you do your sightseeing. I do not see any reason to pay the four seasons prices if you are going to leave first thing in the morning and return late at night - you'll really miss out on all of the four seasons perks your paying for.    We stayed 4 nights at other places on the big island to do our sightseeing (including two in Volcano, HI) and then 5 days of relaxing at the four seasons. I would definitely recommend that.",Jun 2010,June 2010,Traveled as a couple,,Alabama

Stunning, amazing, beautiful -- adjectives don't do this place justice. It was absolutely agonizing to leave such a wonderful property. Service is fantastic and friendly without being too in your face or overwhelming. Every detail that you can think of has already been taken care of -- the rooms are phenomenal, the grounds immaculate, and the scenery is great. If you go, think about getting a ground floor room rather than 2nd floor -- it's actually cheaper and you get a private, outdoor shower.

Spending time in a cabana is the height of luxury -- cold washcloths, water with lemon and poolside lunch make you feel special. Don't miss the cultural center where you can take a ukaleli lesson or make a shell bracelet and learn more about Hawaii from the staff. A little known pot of coffee can be found from 5 to 7 AM next to registration. You can take advantage of opportunities offered at the resort to feed the Ray and tour the ponds and gardens.

64339309,50,Spa-Wow; Good Tennis. Large corporate group changes the feel.,"After staying at the Four Seasons in Punta Mita Mexico twice in the last year, I was interested to see how Hualalai stacked up, they are reasonably similar places, but with plusses and small minuses or differences. After a long flight Hualalai is an easy 10-15 minute ride from the airport. Nice! Pleasant check in, rooms etc. have been fully and accurately discussed in other reviews. We had a ground floor room in the Seashell (family pool) area with a bit of a view. The outdoor shower was a treat, but probably for a couple another less family-oriented/busy crecent would be better. The resort is of relatively compact size,it might take 10 minutes to walk from end to end. Several corporate events, including a group of at least 100 took over some public spaces in the evening, and changed the atmosphere, not for the better since it feels odd to continually walking past a party to which you're not invited and the outdoor music might have been too much for the early to bed crowd. The gym and spa areas were outstanding, with spa service really hospitable, I no sooner peeked into the spa area than someone brought me a tray of fruits and nuts and a drink, even though I admitted that I was only nosing around. Really nice lap pool, gym/spa locker room and gender-specific private relaxation area, including outdoor showers and plunge pool/Jacuzzi. There were a number of fitness/yoga/Pilates classes a day which we didn't use, but I think the additional cost was minimal. This could be a nice alternative to a stay at a real spa for the fitness-oriented. The gym, lap pool, tennis facility and fitness area seemed largely used by residents. Tennis was quite good with daily drills, multiple good pros, and round robins 2X/week - a very friendly atmosphere at the tennis center which seemed resident-oriented. Prices for tennis were reasonable too, for $30 you get a drill, unlimited court time (there are lighted courts) and equipment, including shoes if needed. The beach is nice to walk along on the path, spectacular houses and small beaches in one direction and the retro Kona Village hotel in the other direction. Snorkeling was average, we did much better in other parts of the island. The restaurants were about what you would expect, the moon and stars (or something like that) buffet looked good - only Saturday night. Many guests seemed to eat on their terraces, as did we. If I came here with 3 or more people I'd probably check into renting a villa from one of the owners - the prices seem competitive with hotel rooms. Back to Hualalai Vs Punta Mita; kid areas at Punta Mita, especially the game room for older children are better. Distances between the room and pool and other facilities are better at Hualalai. Beach is a wash -- no real beach at Hualalai and the surf at Punta Mita is frequently so strong that it isn't reasonable for many. For tennis, advantage Hualalai; food quality/price is about the same. Rooms, very nice for both. Spa/gym physical facility, I'd stack Hualalai against anywhere, I didn't use any services. On resort activities - Punta Mita; off resort Hualalai for certain. As for ""feel"" it may just have been the presence of groups and outside functions, but I found Punta Mita warmer both on the guest-guest and management/staff-guest level.",May 2010,May 2010,Traveled as a couple,,chicago IL
63966551,50,On The Big Island the Four Seasons IS the destination,"What a fantastic hotel! There doesn't appear to be much action on The Big Island compared to other resort areas I've been to, but you really have no need to leave this resort. There is a lot to do!  There are several pools at the hotel, but we were mostly at the ""quiet"" pool. The service was fantastic. The pool attendants come by throughout the day with fun little surprises like cool towels, popsicles, aloe vera, evian spritz, samples of yummy cocktails and my personal favorite... cleaning your sunglasses.  What I loved the most about service at this hotel was that it was wonderful, but unpretentious. Very laid back atmosphere even though you're at a five star hotel.  I only went to the gym once while on vacation (bad!), but I have never seen better gym facilities at a hotel. The gym, which is made up of several small buildings with a lap pool in the center, has so much modern equipment it's crazy. You will never have to wait in line for a machine. I even saw a pilates room which appeared to have real pilates equipment.  Unfortunately, I did not make it to the cultural center but I heard great things about it.  We had some excellent meals at the restaurants. My husband's absolute favorite thing to eat was the ahi tuna sashimi. I kid you not, he ordered it 3 times in the first 24 hours!

Rooms were very nice; however, you could hear your neighbors chairs being moved around on the tiled floors. Only draw back was that there were many ""mini"" conventions at the resort and some had the ""college springbreak"" mentality. I wish Four seasons would cut down on these conventions, but I'm sure it is a way for them to generate more revenue.    This is a not a place to go if you want a bargin or if you're on a budget.

59230082,50,Perfect Paradise!,"From the moment you land at Kona Airport, the exceptional Four Seasons service begins. Although we bk'd a rental car, the hotel guest services people were there to greet us and help us locate our bags while we went to get the car. Loved that! They loaded us up, gave us waters and directions. The hotel was 6-7 miles away from the airport and an easy, straight shot.    CHECK-IN was the best -- in one of the lounge areas off the lobby. We were ""lei'd"" then given refreshments, fruit and cold towels. After a quick signature we were taken via golf cart to our rooms.    Although there was a minor hiccup at the beginning of our stay ( we requested for quiet rooms to recoup from the flu but we were put next to the kids' pool area and then an amphitheater of sorts where they had two nights of loud parties and music), Kim and Jeff the front desk managers took care of us and tried their best to make amends.    Yes, PRICES at Pahu'ia and The Beach Tree Cafe were a little steep but we hv to say the breakfast and dinner experiences were worth it. The setting ( by the beach), the food and service (friendly, though sometimes slow) were top notch. We loved the music at the Beach tree cafe at dinner. The extensive breakfast buffet was pricey at $34 but we hardly needed lunch after the huge breakfast. ( Kudos to Daniel the omlette station attendant! He was cheerful and nice to chat with every morning!). The breakfast spread was quie spectacular. The fresh waffles were our favorite!    The CULTURAL CTR, POOLS, BEACH, SPA and GYM at the resort could NOT be beat. We found it hard to leave and go sightsee. There was so much to do and something of interest for everyone in our family from grandparents to parents to kids. The Kids For All Seasons program everyday was complimentary which was a nice option. Other complimentary events included a night whn a NASA scientist came to speak. Cocktails and a bounty of hors d'oeuvrs were served prior. The night we left, there was movie night by the beach with complimentary burgers and hotdogs for everyone. So although the FS was expensive, you didn't feel nickel and dimed as in other pricey, luxury resorts. They did their best to make you feel welcomed and taken care of. You weren't forgotten after check-in.    There is a great jogging route but we kept returning to the beautiful gym/spa. It was one of the best we've ever been to. There were machines indoors and outdoors. There was also a lap pool there so you didn't hv to return to the beach area to finish your workout. The tennis courts, basketball court and climbing wall were always available. Although we were there at the height of spring break, the place never seemed packed with people. There were always machines available or lanes to swim in.    By the way, we had a rental car and PARKING at the open lot was complimentary. It wasn't a far walk to the hotel either. If we had shopping, the valets would spot you and rush over to help then offer you a ride back to your room in a golf cart. Those guys were always friendly, hardworking and helpful. They also gave us bottles of cold waters everyday when we left to see the sights.    Every amenity is so well thought of. Housekeeping can provide you with anything at a moment's notice. The L'occitane products are our favorite esp the after sun care lotion. We also loved the big straw tote they put in the closet for our use. We used it for everything everyday from beach to shopping to sight seeing to gym! ANother thing we loved was, besides the complimentary bottled waters, that the fridge was left empty for our use. Since we were jet lagged my daughter was hungry at odd hours. Rather than order room service for tour small eater, I brought soups for her. Housekeeping brought a microwave and left it in our room for our entire stay. It was nice to be able to heat up leftovers as well.    The CONCIERGE desk was always staffed with such helpful, nice people. They sent us information and asked if they could be of assistance well before our arrival. Joy, one of the concierges, arranged for extra and complimentary ukulele lessons for my daughter with someone at the cultural ctr.. In a week, my daughter picked up the ukulele and she has been entertaining us! Her teacher so kindly put together a folder of music sheets for her whn we left. There was also a day when the adults had a food tour across town while my daughter did the (awful) Dolphin Quest program at The Hilton Waikoloa. I was in a bind fo someone to pick her up. Joy arranged for the hotel car to pick her up and drop her off at the Kids For All Seasons. Complimentary, to boot!    I can't say enough about how wonderful the Four Seasons Hualalai is. The staff is the best trained team I've ever come across. They were helpful, professional and friendly/courteous 100% of the time. Whoever you passed as you were walking to and fro your room/pool/gym/whereever, they always made eye contact and greeted you with a smile and an "" aloha"". From the front desk operation to restaurant waitstaff/valet people, all the way to gardeners, NOONE skipped a beat. This is a professional, well-oiled and well-run machine. I've been to the best of the best in this world and The Four Seasons Hualalai is hard to beat.    We had a great time. They did a excellent job pampering my whole family and making us feel so welcomed. We are already planning our return next spring break.

58307346,50,Lovely Hotel,"We stayed here for five days and were very impressed. Our room overlooking the snorkeling pool was fantastic and the housekeeping service was very good (except for the fact that they do not remember to pick up shoes left on the door for shining). The health and fitness areas are the best I have ever experienced. Great location ---- one is able to walk down the beach to Kona Village (good swimming beach there, unlike at the hotel) on one side and Kuki'o on the other...lots of green sea turtles basking on the shore.    The food was excellent, albeit overpriced e.g. we were charged $21 for a Beefeaters martini at Pahui on our first night, so we never went back. Our favorite eating spot was the property owners' grill out on the beach at the periphery of the property --- great view, great food and more reasonable prices. I also heard from friends that the grill above the golf course was their favorite dining spot in Dec. 2009, but it had closed by February.    We also played golf a couple of times --- very playable resort course, but to get value for the greens fees, my wife and I teed off early and played 18 holes and then played later in the day (be sure to schedule enough time, as the staff leaves and the course closes at 5:30 p.m. to save on overtime). This way you can get in 36 holes for the $250 green fees, which are good for the whole day.    The hotel staff did an excellent job the day of the tsunami warning. We were evacuated from our room at 7:30 in the morning. Everyone was taken up to the golf club area at the property owners' course up on the hill. We spent the day there until 3:30pm, when the emergency was declared to be over. Luckily, we snagged prime seats by the little pool, so didn't feel too put out. The Four Seasons served all 450 people (Kona Village folks were there, too) an excellent breakfast buffet and lunch, too, with a few different stations and selections. This will probably be the only time in my life that I will get two free meals at a Four Seasons.!!! In all seriousness, the staff did a great job with the whole day, despite the total disruption of everyone's routines.",Mar 2010,March 2010,Traveled as a couple,,"Tiburon, California"
58043684,50,In the lap of luxury in Hawaii,"Incredible. From the moment you arrive on the property to the moment you leave, this complex is breath-taking. We arrived at 6 am on a Sunday and was welcomed to a fantastic breakfast buffett and views of the humpbacks breaching the entire time. Much of the family's time was spent by one of the four pools on the property. Meals each night at Pahui, the Lava Lounge, or the Beach tree were fantastic. Activities such as the King's Pond for Snorkeling or outside activies such as diving down the beach, whale watching, or just wandering looking for turtles was second to none.    If I could have one complaint, it's the price, but what can you say? You get what you pay for. I look forward to my return.",Mar 2010,March 2010,Traveled with family,,"Winterville, North Carolina"
57984729,50,Great destination,"My wife and I have stayed at this resort about 6 times since the late 90's. It is an outstanding hotel, and a great destination in its own right. Usually we rent a car and see the sights of the Big Island, but this time we were ready for a totally relaxing break and decided to stay on the property for a week.    We have stayed in both ocean view and golf-ocean view rooms. We prefer the golf-ocean view as they are definitely quieter.    We had a wonderful week from February 17th to 24th. The weather was perfect every day and we had a very restful time. Daily routine: I ran 5-6 miles every morning as the sun was coming up, we then had coffee on the beach, followed by an hour of yoga; then an excellent breakfast in Pahu i’a, just a few metres from the ocean, then sitting on the beach and reading or dozing until late afternoon when it was time to move to the pool for a drink. Fresh fish for dinner every night. One week was definitely not enough!    There’s a pleasant running loop where you head south from the property, along the beach side path, then up a quiet access road towards the highway and then down the road to Kona Village Resort, and back to the Four Seasons. I ran at dawn, and it was very pleasant. It would be hot later in the day, as you are running through fields of lava, no shelter at all. I saw some wild goats out on the lava one day. I can't imagine how they survive.    We also did a little snorkeling on the property, in the King’s pond and the lagoon. Very pleasant. There were plenty of whales every day outside the reef, and sea turtles on the beach. The fitness center (Hualalai sports club) is outstanding.    Pahu i’a is a super restaurant: first class dining and very professional staff.    Just a couple of negative comments. The only other good dining room, Hualalai Grille, is currently closed. The FS web site says that it’s closed “for renovations” but the staff told us that it’s been closed for over a year. That’s unfortunate because it’s the only alternative for good dining. We had dinner one night at the Breach Tree, and the service was so inept as to be laughable - all courses arrived at the same time, before our drinks. And I’m sure this was related - no management staff in sight - very unusual in our experience for a Four Seasons property. The Beach Tree is fine for a pool side snack or drink, but that’s all. We also had in-room dining. The service was excellent.    The other issue is smoking. There is too much smoking away from the designated smoking areas; really there shouldn't be any. Again there does not seem to be enough of a management presence and the other staff don’t want to enforce the no smoking rules. We saw guests smoking within a few feet of the children’s pool and just outside the entrances to the restaurants, as well as on various paths throughout the grounds. This is worse than in the 90's. I don’t get it.    Overall five stars, but there are areas that need management attention.",Mar 2010,February 2010,Traveled as a couple,,Alberta

56708789,50,Our favorite place,"We try and get to Hualalai every year to celebrate my birthday which just happens to be right before the Christmas holiday rush. From the moment you arrive at Hualalai you are treated very special. There is a ""kids for all seasons"" program for those parents who want to sit by the adult pool while their kids have a blast, but there is lots to do with the kids too. We never leave the property. The best thing about the trip is that you can fly direct from LA to Kona, they pick you up with car seats, and you can rent jogging strollers for your stay. That means that as a parent of three young kids we basically only pack our bathing suites and flip flops.    The spa is amazing, food is exceptional, and the service is spot on. The only draw back is that it's expensive and rarely have we caught any type of special even though we've been going there as a family every year since it opened. The only exception being last year when they were remodeling... but even the staff told us to avoid it last year for that very reason.",Feb 2010,December 2009,Traveled with family,,"Los Angeles, CA"

The property is immaculate, the landscaping incredible, and the  locale is breathtaking. All the amenities you could want in a resort are here. Although we spent quite a lot of time exploring the island, we did talk to other guests who were spending their entire vacation within the resort.

55962811,50,Lives up to the hype,"When looking for a honeymoon destination, several colleagues recommended the Four Seasons Hualalai as ""the best resort in the world"". I thought it was odd that several well-traveled folks would use the same phrase and was a bit skeptical, but we decided to see for ourselves whether it lived up to this lofty praise--not only was it true but it exceeded all expectations.    Service was phenomenal. Check-in occurred in the open air lobby, on a couch where we were greeted with lais and mai tais, before the bellhop took us in a golf cart to our oceanfront room. We headed straight for an 80 minute Lomi lomi massage which was a great way to unwind after the long flight over. The hotel left Champagne on ice as a welcome gift and we enjoyed it while watching the humpback whales just offshore from our patio. On the beach, employees offer Evian spritzes, chocolates and ice cream bars as they circulate around setting guests up on the beach. Absent was the fake smiles you frequently see from employees at resorts like this---everyone seemed genuinely happy to be there and greeted guests with a warmth seldom encountered elsewhere.    Property restaurants were excellent and I can see how folks can stay there for a week and not leave the property given the selection. The only comparable meal we had outside the resort was at Merriman's, which was definitely worth the 45 minute drive to Waimea. We ate at twice at Pahu i'a and when informed of my nut and shellfish allergies, the chef came out himself and offered to cook anything I wanted on a separate grill to avoid cross contamination. In five years of NYC dining we've never experienced such a personal touch. Beachtree was a good casual eat and my wife still raves about the chocolate tsunami.    The concierge was very good, lining up everything we wanted to do prior to our arrival. They suggested the Blue Hawaiian helicopter tour, which was a good time, and helped score the last minute Merriman's reservation. Valet guys were really cool and recommended a few places off the beaten path worth visiting when we drove around the island which enhanced our visit (gotta try the donuts at Tex's).    Finally, the amenities were excellent. Professional quality tennis courts with complimentary drink service, a nice lap pool and gym and the phenomenal spa. Several different pools and oceanfront setups provided privacy and prevented any crowding.    The only negatives I found were certain add-ons. When you're paying over $1,000 a night for a room, wireless internet should be included, and not an additional $14/day charge. They also could do a better job of disclosing the overnight valet charge when we arrived, which while only $20 or so a night, wasn't noticed until check out.    That said, we had a wonderful time, can't say enough about how great this place is and look forward to returning soon.",Feb 2010,February 2010,Traveled as a couple,,nyc
55143987,50,Our New #1,"We stayed in an ocean-front room between the family pool and one of the two ""quiet"" pools (one is no kids, the other (closer to us) allowed kids, but no phones and everyone has to be respectful - it was our favorite pool). The length of the trip was 10 days, and consisted of beach/pool down time, activities (helicopter ride - Blue Hawaii was great), luaus next door at the Kona Village, and dining everywhere - on the lanai, by the pool, in the restaurant, etc. We also used the gym extensively (best gym of any hotel in which we've stayed - hands down). It's also important to note that the hotel was not full, but was probably 50-70% - I believe 100% occupancy with a higher number of children could have changed the experience.    As should not be a surprise, the staff were (by and large) amazing: attentive without being obsequious, and ever present. The hotel itself and coastline were really, really nice (I don't understand it when people say they dislike the dry side of the island, but to each his own).    Many of the guests seemed friendly, and we made a few 'vacation friends' (i.e., other couples with whom to share the occasional drink, meal, etc.).    Food-wise, the sushi was great and the turkey burger was amazing. The drinks were actually a little weak.    The only real negatives were certain costs. Specifically, when you're paying >$1K a night for your room, to be charged $12/day for Internet is ridiculous. Also, although we all know it's an expensive trip, several other couples with whom we spoke felt that the hotel was nickel-and-diming the guests (e.g., there was an infamous $7 hard-boiled egg).    By and large, an amazing hotel. We had some friends next door at the Kona Village, and it was night and day - no comparison. We may go back as soon as next month again.

55054635,50,Great Resort! Fantastic Service! A little costly but it is the Four Seasons...,"Hello,    My wife and I stayed and the resort for a long weekend. The resort is beautiful. The grounds, rooms, and overall location are great. I found the staff to be out of this world. The pool service was great and watching the whales jump out of the ocean during lunch was such a site to see. We were also able to see the turtles right on the beach and check out the ""pond"" with over 150 fish right on-site.    If you are looking for a TOP NOTCH resort this is the place.    The downside to this resort is it is extremely expensive. I understand that and I can accept it to a certain degree. The only thing that really turned me off was the cost of breakfast. Breakfast both in the room and via the restaurant buffet was around $100.00 for the two of us each day. We were able to have lunch for less than that. I think that breakfast needs to be adjusted but I guess that is a small complaint for such a great resort.",Feb 2010,January 2010,Traveled on business,,"Chicago, Illinois"
54729922,50,"This , IMHO, is absolutely the best resort ....period.","Having done a great deal of traveling over the last 40 years,and living reasonably well in NYC, I am fairly discerning about hotels. I must say this place was simply fabulous.  The room we had was lovely, with a double sink, a jacuzzi and two showers, one of them outdoors ( kinda) and surrounded by orchids and lava walls. I am a major ""shower buff"", this one gets the biscuit . Ask for a room on the first floor, which have the outdoor showers.  The service was superb, attention to every detail in every way. To be fair , they are a little slow but.....we were not running anywhere, and the leisurely service was actually helpful in that it got us to relax even more. The staff was helpful and friendly and it all added up to a lovely and relaxed time.  The food was superb We caught the surf and turf buffet which, although a bit expensive, represented great service. The food was terrific, plentiful and very well prepared.  The grounds are wonderful, the beach is great to swim in, and to sit by. The hotel provides you with cold towels, water and an occasional fruit treat.  There was a pool stocked with many different fish, among them eagle rays and snappers.....it was just outside our door and that was a real treat!  I am someone who needs to go to the gym and I fight going, though the adult in me sees the need. What I need is a gym facility like Hualalai! it was perfect....the lap pool was hardly used and I swam to my heart's content, the gym equipment was great and they do have organized activities for adults ( spinning, walking, yoga etc.) but even without it , it was great. The best part is the reward at the end.....an outdoor jaccuzi, outdoor showers festooned with orchids, a steam and sauna, and all you need to come back to the room smelling like a rose( LOL).

51762842,50,"We Got Married Here---Loved It, Loved It, Loved It . . .","I am in love with the Four Seasons Hualalai. I just love it here. The grounds are beautifully landscaped, with beautiful architecture. The bungalows are well spaced out so that you don't feel like others are even staying here. I was married here in May 2008, and Susanna Trujillo was our lovely catering manager/wedding coordinator. She did a lovely job, and every detail was attended to. The food was delicious, the room was perfect. All amenities are included (small fridge, various drinks, Off bug spray, sunblock). You can't even lift a finger if you tried. Oh, how relaxing to even think about being there. The food was wonderful here. The sunsets are beautiful here, and look simply spectacular even compared to the sunset view from just a few miles up the coast (at the Fairmont, where stayed in 2009). Turtles come and lay in the sand right on the beach. They're easy to spot, and just so amazing that they lay there. Everyone is gracious and the service is amazing. You feel as if they are really catering to you, and not faking a smile. I don't know how to explain it, but there's just a magic about this place. It makes you almost want to whisper when you're on the property. All you hear are the leaves blowing in the wind and the sound of the waves on the beach. Go, you won't regret it. Better yet, get married there =)    Random story, The parking lot security guard said the funniest thing to us in November when we went back...we were looking for a parking space (and there weren't any in self park). He pulled up behind us and ""pulled us over"". We thought he was going to bug us or say something weird. Instead, he said, ""You know, you can valet. They park the car for you."" I just thought that was so hilarious, since, that's kind of the meaning of valeting your car. He really meant it, though and was just trying to help us out.",Dec 2009,May 2008,,,"Los Angeles, CA"
51489312,30,Not Four Seasons service,"Ok. I will do the pros and cons, but I must say this was NOT at all Four Seasons style service. And I am easy going and VERY forgiving when it comes to service; over the top, kiss butt service makes me uncomfortable. However, when paying this much to stay and averaging $400 to $500 a day on food/ drink, I expect much more.    Pros: The location is mind blowing. Beauty and paradise at its finest. The weather was perfect, the views incredible and the spread unreal.    2. The food was really good. Really pricey, but I expected that. I noticed we were one of the few families guzzling down drinks and food. I suggest a specially priced drink everyday. The prices turn a lot of people off these days.    3. The resort is very well kept, and you don't ""see"" the maintence occurring.    4. They have FREE child care. 8am to 5pm! I suggest tipping these girls. They are responsible for your children for God's sake and working for low wages to care for others bratty kids! Our girl was shocked by a daily tip.    5. They have 5?? pools. A snorkel pool, which is cool. The ""tiki"" pool was not impressive but we sat there everyday out of convenience. The quiet pool's a joke. Such a scene and no cells. It was WEIRDLY quiet.    6. The gym is fabulous and free as well!!!! (Not classes though)    Cons: The service was OFF!!! We would ask random ?'s like how do you get here....(Place is large and can be confusing) No one ever knew! Maybe 2x. The staff never knew what was in a food or drink either. I mean if I'm paying $50.00 for lunch per person, figure it out. We waited FOREVER for cocktails. HELLO?!?! At $15 to $20 a shot, it's called upselling. Also, by the end of the trip I think they noticed we liked our booze and food so you gun for those people. Another odd thing, we would stand confused at numerous times during the trip and staff would walk by us. SOOO not Four Seasons style. I must mention though, Tom the bartender from Seattle was FABULOUS. Genuine nice guy probably mixed w/ here these idiots come to spend $200 on a night cap.    2. The rooms are a NIGHTMARE. You hear EVERY SINGLE THING your 3 neighbors do. I mean my head was spinning. Water running, toilets flushing, walking, talking. One night I think upstairs neighbors were bowling! OBNOXIOUS. For the $ I don't want to hear crap!!! Our daughter barely slept and that's a huge issue for me. I mean I didn't bring her to Vegas and say this.    3. The front desk didn't know anything about anything. The suggestions were terrible. Thank God we had been there a few times. We never left the resort.    I will say the $16 valet is wonderful. Also RENT a car, even if for a day. It's HALF as much than a round trip drive to town. $100 plus to go to town and back. And if you do a boat thing, do the whale/ dolphin thing at KONA VILLAGE. Least cheesy, short and sweet and amazing!! They don't bother them in their natural habitat but we swam TWICE w/ HUNDREDS of them.

51465539,50,Peaceful getaway,My husband and I traveled to FS Haulalai for the first part of a ten day trip for our anniversary. We stayed to last five days in Maui and the FS( see review at their website).  The property on Kona was amazing. We were upgraded to a suite and had a room that faced the King's pond and beach. The outdoor shower was so relaxing and refreshing. The beach isn't great for swimming or snorkeling but such a beautiful view! Also there are turtles that come up on the beach to rest. Very fun to observe. Many tide pools with great sea life as well. The gym and spa facilities are top notch and made it easy to exercise even on vacation! The Beach Tree Grill was a favorite spot to eat both for lunch and dinner. The only thing travelers should know is the entire resort closes down by 1000. Very quiet. The best lounge is the Lava Lounge. It is located on the second floor and has the most breathtaking view BUT is only open from 5:30 to 7:00! Apparently it is to the bartenders discretion to stay open later but the latest we were there was 8:30 Such a waste of a great location! The pools are nice. Not as nice as the Maui FS but still good service. We found the King's pond interesting. It had a variety of fish and even eagle rays but the water is dirty compared to snorkeling in the ocean! Good spot to teach first time snorkelers. All in all it is a wonderful property and very relaxing. Typical four seasons service(just not as much as the FS in Maui). We did go on the Star Gazing tour to Mauna Kea! Wonderful! I would highly recommend the trip.,Dec 2009,November 2009,Traveled as a couple,,washington
51132556,50,Best resort I have ever been!!!!,"It is indescribable! I love the fact it is a smaller hotel. All rooms are in bungalows and you walk outside to get to them. The views from most of the rooms are exceptional. I have been to this resort 10 times and I cannot go anywhere else. The staff knows us by name, Mr. and Mrs., and are oh so friendly and will do anything. From Terry who greets you when you arrive, to Dexter the bellman, Cora, Maggie, and the 2 chefs at Pahui'a for breakfast, Mehelani at the pool, Tom and Frank at the Beach Tree Bar and numerous other people who have worked there for years, they are all fantastic! It is beautiful, quiet and even when full, it never feels like you are on top of each other. The outdoor garden showers are the best! Took the kids for the first time 2 summers ago and they are begging to go back! Spent 4th of July there that year, spectacular fireworks on the ocean, fabulous buffet at Beach Tree. The spa has been recently remodeled and the hot rock massage is pure heaven and the ayurvedic foot massage, to die for. The golf course is so beautiful and only resort guests and residents can play on it, so it is not crowded. Again, I cannot say enough about this resort and I am planning my next trip back soon and I don't want to stay anywhere else in Hawaii. One thing I don't like so much is that they never used to charge for parking and now they charge a daily fee. When you come to a resort like that, adding such a fee is ridiculous. Then you tend to park yourself and it's not like you don't tip the valets anyway. This just started a couple of years ago. Also, no free internet, there is a daily fee for that as well. Again, a resort of this caliber should include such things.

50830275,50,This was my second time back and it still blew me away,"I love this resort! The hotel totally has the aloha vibe.    My husband and I first came on our honeymoon, and just returned for our three year anniversary. (I have a great husband, what can I say!) This is by far the best Four Seasons in North America, (Punta Mita a very close second.) It is my favorite hotel in the world. The rooms are amazing, the staff is wonderful. The hotel is beautifully kept …I am not sure that there is not one thing broken, out of place, stained, dirty or ragged looking.    We were here on Thanksgiving week, so it was a bit kid friendly which hindered the quite atmosphere a bit. We never ate at the Beachtree for this reason, as I almost got burned by some unsupervised children running with burning marshmallow as there parents were enjoying a bon fire on the beach. Ideally if you do not have children and you can visit the resort when the kids are in school, it is the best thing you can do.    Great Spa- however the night I had my treatment was also movie night for the kids so I could clearly hear the movie while I was trying to relax which was not cool. Tip- coordinate your treatment on a night when there is no movie, and everything will be great.    The golf course is very forgiving; it is a great course and is very relaxing. Sid, the refreshment guy is a doll. The food at the Grill is great, and the Lava Lounge is a great place for drinks at night.    I am not into breakfast, but I highly recommend the bed and breakfast package in terms of value and quality.    The only problem with the resort is, it is so nice you don’t want to leave it to explore the rest of the island. This can create another problem, eating breakfast lunch and dinner here can sure add up. However after leaving the Four Seasons we island hopped and went to Kauai and stayed three horrible nights at the Hyatt. (see my review) What I realized via my Hyatt experience is that dollar for dollar, the Four Seasons actually is the best bargain around, in terms of what you are receiving in exchange for your money.

After leaving we went to the volcanoes and then back to the west side, but trying to be frugal and instead of returning to the Four Seasons we booked another ""four and a half star"" resort via hotwire for less than half the price of the Four Seasons. The other resort really couldn't hold a candle to the Four Seasons facilities, rooms, location, staff, and overall experience.

We spent almost three weeks in Hawaii, splitting time between Four Seasons Hualalai on the big Island, Four Seasons Maui and Four Seasons Lanai.    We began our trip at Hualalai, and as impressive as the Four Seasons resorts are on all islands, we kept wishing we were back there. Next time, would not even bother leaving for another island. The accomodations, staff, food and facilities (particularly fitness/spa) are unlike any other resort.    The outdoor ""grotto"" type showers were amazing and the overall service and attentiveness by all the staff was unsurpassed. Take your time and explore the entire property-so much to see. Our friends stayed at the Hilton which was like Disney World and they wound up hating the Big Island because of it. I will always treasure our time there and plan on gettting back just as soon as possible.

50468133,50,The perfect resort for a family holiday,"Our visit to Hualalai was also our first overseas holiday with our 10 month old daughter. We were apprehensive about travelling with an infant, however the Four Seasons ensured that our experience was a fantastic one. The service started a few weeks before we left Sydney when we were contacted by the incredibly helpful concierge service to assist with any bookings and advice we might need. We also used this initial contact with the hotel to organise for our room to be stocked with baby gear - a high chair, bottle warmer, crib and diaper pail. Any parent will realise how much easier this made our stay, and how much lighter it made our bags!    Our Golf Ocean View room was really impressive, particularly given that it was the most affordable on offer at the resort. The view over the golf course out to the ocean was gorgeous and the room and balcony were surprisingly spacious. We were pleased to have an upstairs room as we felt that they were much more private than those on the lower levels. Now that we are familiar with the resort, should we return, I think we'd probably choose a room over the Kings Pond or Palm Grove for a more immediate ocean view and to be a bit closer to the main hub of the resort. I personally would not want to stay in the rooms near the Sea Shell or Beach Tree pools as these are very busy areas and there was limited privacy for the guests here (particularly on the lower levels). The general upkeep of the resort also warrants a mention - the gardens, paths, ponds and pools were always spotless (and beautiful) which just added to how inviting this place is.    The room was stocked with decent sized L'Occitane toiletries and also a selection of baby toiletries and nappies for our daughter. Housekeeping refreshed the toiletries frequently and they also offer an aromotherapy service at turn down (you select the essential oil that you would like your room refreshed with). We didn't take up this option due to the potential for headaches but it seemed like a nice touch.    We'd recommend including breakfast in your rate. It is served at Pahu i a, the hotel's main restaurant and while it wasn't the largest or most inventive buffet we'd ever had there was a great variety on offer with daily egg, omelette and pancake specials to ensure variety over a longer stay. The Thanksgiving Buffet at Pahu ia was a real highlight of our stay. The seafood on offer was delicious and the dessert buffet was out of this world. On our second last night we had a romantic dinner for two there while our daughter was being looked after by the nanny service. This meal was really, really impressive and we would highly recommend that you have at least one dinner here during your stay – the atmosphere is suitably different from breakfast to make it worthwhile. The Beach Tree Restaurant was great for a drink at the bar and for light meals (salads, burgers etc). We had quite a few of our meals while lounging by the pool or on the beach – it’s really the perfect way to eat while at Hualalai.    Although we have only ever left our daughter with family members we actually felt surprisingly comfortable using the hotel nanny service (once for dinner and twice during the day so we could enjoy lunch and an afternoon by the pool). If you book in advance, the company will ensure that you have the same nanny throughout your stay (if you book for more than one session). All staff are police checked and mature and the hotel organised all the bookings on our behalf which made the whole process seamless and stress free.    Another great feature of the resort is the Hualalai Trading Company, an upmarket general store located near the health club. Because of our daughter’s nap times we spent much more time in our room than we would have on previous holidays so it was great to be able to stock up on drinks and snacks (having an empty fridge rather than an overpriced mini bar in our room was a pleasant surprise of this resort). There was also a selection of baby care items, toiletries and souvenirs on offer. The Hualalai Coffee Company next door is great stop if you like espresso coffees and provides some nice lighter lunch options like sandwiches, milkshakes etc.    You know that you are staying a fantastic resort when, on your last day, you start feeling pangs jealousy when you see the new arrivals being driven through the resort! We'd highly recommend the Four Seasons at Hualalai. Obviously there are much less expensive accommodation options available, however, given everything on offer and the quality of it all, the Four Seasons offers great value for money.",Dec 2009,November 2009,Traveled with family,,"Mount Pleasant, Australia"
50011650,50,Paradise Found,"The Four Seasons Hualalai is, hands down, the best resort that my husband and I have ever visited. We have stayed at other Four Seasons hotels, several Ritz Carltons, and Fairmonts, both in the US and abroad but this resort is a standout. We stayed in a 2nd floor room overlooking King's Pond with an ocean view. Other reviewers have recommended the Palm Grove section for peace and quiet but we found this area to be quiet and beautiful, as well. I won't reiterate the many wonderful things said by other reviewers but I will add these tips:  1. The cultural center is definitely worth visiting. It has many hands-on artifacts of Hawaiian culture. The staff are extremely welcoming and offer complimentary classes that were fun.  2. Self parking is free. If you arrive with a rental car, the bellhop will automatically try to valet your car which has a cost but if you say that you would like to self park, they very graciously point out the lot closest to your hotel room.  3. Definitely snorkel in King's Pond. I was brand new to snorkeling and found this a safe environment to learn. They provide snorkel gear but if you plan to snorkel offsite, you may wish to bring your own or rent outside of the resort since King's Pond closes at 4pm.  4. I recommend having dinner at their upscale restaurant at sunset. Ask for a lanai table for a gorgeous ocean view.  5. If you're budget-minded and you're a Costco member, drive 10 minutes south and stock up on wine, champagne, and picnic/lunch stuff. The rooms come with an empty mini-refrigerator that you can stock.  6. Don't overpack because there are complimentary LG front load washers/dryers with Tide detergent, Spray and Wash, and Bounce scattered throughout the resort.    As tempting as it would be to stay at this gorgeous resort for your entire vacation, it really is worth it to explore this amazing island. Other tips outside of the Four Seasons:    1. Visit Volcano National Park. But bring your rain gear and long pants. The nearby city of Hilo is the wettest city in the US.    2. If you go on a nighttime manta ray snorkel (highly recommended!), consider that many of the companies have you hold onto a float to watch these beautiful creatures. If you're prone to motion sickness, this might be a problem for you since the float is tossed in the waves. Many of our fellow passengers lost their lunch. Even so, this is an extremely memorable activity (in a good way!).    3. We found ""Hawaii: The Big Island Revealed"" a very helpful and thorough guide for everything on the island.    4. For a great dinner, we enjoyed Roy's which is about a 15 minute drive north. Their butterfish is incredible.    Overall, my husband and I agreed that this was the best vacation we have ever had. Unlike at other luxury resorts where I sometimes feel like the staff is artificially effusive, the staff here were genuinely interested in your vacation and often provided tips to enhance your exploration of the island. We can't wait to return!",Nov 2009,November 2009,Traveled on business,,"Boston, MA"
48944437,50,This one is hard to convey in words - it's an EXPERIENCE like none other,"My husband and I stayed 3 nights at this resort during our 7 day honeymoon in Hawaii. We chose to stay 4 nights first at the Four Seasons in Lanai and then 3 here, mostly because Lanai had a 4th night free promo and both hotels were so expensive. Friends had told us that this hotel was the nicest they've been to in the world, and that we would love it. Since it seemed like so many people we knew had been there, we weren't sure that this hotel would be so special and really blow us away, but it did!! The grounds are spectacular, there are 6 pools each in a unique setting -- though, we pretty much stayed at the adult pool the whole time. None of the buildings are more than 2 stories, and the resort is nicely spread out over a large space. So, there was enough energy for it not to be a bore but it was private enough to feel like we were far away from the real world. We had a golf/ocean view which I think are the cheapest (cheap being a relative term here)because they're not immediately on the shore, but we (and a lot of the people we spoke to) preferred these rooms because there is no noise from the pools and they're so secluded. So, if you're considering paying hundreds more for oceanfront, don't even bother...you'll still see the ocean in the distance and you'll have the serenity of the golf course. The restaurants are expensive, so if you can get a rate with a resort credit or free breakfast it helps you not think about whether romaine lettuce with a little caesar salad and croutons should REALLY cost $22 :) While we didnt take advantage, the Fitness Center was like a world class gym. The spa was absolutely beautiful, and they were very accomodating when we wanted to shower and change there before our 9pm departing flight. Also, we were very pleased by the fact that we could self-park...a small gesture from a hotel that could otherwise command a big fee for that. they will valet your car unless you ask where the self parking is, so remember to ask. We could have stayed on the property the entire time, but we did take a few drives to nearby hotels and shopping centers. i guess i'd recommend having a car on this island...just to have options.  In the end we wished we'd just spent the full 7 nights in Kona, and we hope to be lucky enough to go back many times.",Nov 2009,September 2009,Traveled as a couple,,"Los Angeles, CA"

We were led to our room on a golf cart. I was amazed by the room. It was clean and pretty. We received complementary cookies and pillow chocolates were put on the bed every night. Also we were aloud to take out movies FREE!! The hotel had some restaurants. They served an amazing breakfast. The seats had an ocean view.

47701302,50,Unbelievable,"This place is truly unique. The location is stunning, service exceptionally friendly whilst unobtrusive and efficient, the facilities top-notch. The resort itself is in some parts so beautiful it does not even look real. The rooms are huge and with all the comforts (and beyond). The food is delicious, the dining options quite interesting and broad enough to satisfy different moods. It was arguably the best holiday of our lives from a hotel perspective, looking at the overall experience.  Prices are ferociously high for the room ($1350 per night b&b including taxes, for a high-end double room), but I did find food and drinks to be fairly honestly priced considering it's one of the top hotels in the world, in one of the remotest and most spectacular locations.

47452998,50,Is there a six star option?,"After cheering on my brother during his Ironman World Championship Race, I decided to treat myself to one night at the Four Seasons before flying home. BY FAR THIS IS THE MOST EXQUISITE HOTEL I HAVE EVER BEEN TO. I don't say that lightly, and have travelled well through most of the US and Europe. The property is paradise. The rooms are all located in two storied bungalows nestled in between the palm trees. Almost all have ocean views. The pool and poolside service are impeccable (love the Evian misters that come by), the restaurants are incredible, and service is the top priority. I received a complimentary room upgrade upon check in (as well as Hibiscus Tea and a cool cinnamon scented wash cloth). I had dinner at their premier restaurant, and when I didn't eat but half of the main course (nothing wrong with it, just a flavor combination I didn't care for), was given the main course for free and a complimentary dessert--WITHOUT ASKING!!!  The hotel also has an enormous activities staff (one for just water sports, cultural center with activities for adults and children, golf course, spa, etc.), FREE child care program, wonderful restaurants, and amazing service in a very unpretentious manner. I cannot think of one thing to improve.  It's located on a piece of paradise that you get to after driving through the desolation of a volcanic field. The drive is somewhat symbolic as you really leave the world behind upon arrival. The staff was so kind I cannot gush about them enough. My waitress at the beach side bar even offered to take me out with her friends after her shift when she found out I was there alone!  Many places claim to put you in the lap of luxury, and many come close, but I've NEVER been to a place that's perfect.

47283713,40,"Excellent, but...","We had been to the Four Seasons at Hualalai a few years ago for a wonderful dinner, at the Beach Tree Restaurant, and we were always eager to come back and stay at the hotel. Finally, we got our chance: three nights and four very enjoyable days.    First thing to bear in mind - Hualalai is a resort. It is a self-contained world where everything is available on the estate, but it is a distance from the main city, Kailua, and there is not a real sense of being in Hawaii. This may not appeal to everyone, and we did occasionally feel the resort ""claustrophobia"" while we were there, and made a couple of emergency trips off-property. (There was a little ""Wizard of Oz"" feel to the place - but we were soon lulled by the luxuries...)    Having said that, the experience is what you would expect from a Four Seasons hotel: service is wonderful and friendly and generally, very discrete. The property itself is immaculate - manicured lawns (tended to by, it seems, an army of staff), delightful pool-side and beach-side areas and roomy, bright rooms. We booked a room next to the 18th. hole on the golf course, one of the less expensive rooms. It was large and very private, with a great outdoor shower. It was a bit removed from the main areas of the resort. (I imagine that's why it was a bit cheaper than some of the other rooms.) For us, this was an advantage - not least because it allowed us to park our car next to the room, something that was not possible with most of the other rooms (and also to avoid a fairly sneaky $16 ""overnight valet park"" daily charge we'd have paid, had we not self-parked the car.)    This brings me to my main criticism of the resort -- there are charges for everything (and there are hidden charges for many things) and in general, the charges are quite outrageous. In some cases, this is to be expected, and even justified. (My girlfriend had a facial and a Lomi Lomi massage, and in both cases, they were outstanding.) In contrast, I spend 25 minutes on the climbing wall with a (not very instructive) instructor, and paid $57 + tip, an astonishing amount for a very limited activity. Much of this is no surprise to regular patrons of high-end hotels. However, at Hualalai, it seemed very extreme to me, and most concerning, it seemed in some cases, a bit underhand.    Nevertheless, I was seduced by the warm, seeming-genuine service, and the feeling of pampered luxury in the place. (After a few days, it seems like a chore to leave the place for the real world, even for us restless folk.) A nice touch - the informal drinks get-together at the Lava Lounge on our last night. Notwithstanding my earlier comments, we still felt like valued and well-cared-for guests. If your budget can stretch to it, this is a wonderful place to stay.",Oct 2009,October 2009,Traveled as a couple,,"San Francisco, California"

46987960,50,The definition of family-oriented luxury,"This resort is posh. Landscaping, the rooms, every detail of the way the place looks is ideal. If you read other reviews, they all say the same thing: it's beautiful. We were impressed. There isn't another resort on the island that can compete.    Upon arrival, we were escorted to our bungalow, near the keiki pool and the sea shell pool. The room was full of refreshments, goodies for our daughter, a cute plush toy, and bath toys. Our room was set back a little bit from the pools, but we still had a nice view of the gardens, the pools, and the ocean behind them. Our room was situated so that our lanai was almost private, and passers-by would have trouble looking in without some effort. Other rooms seemed to be more visible from the walkways, however. The first floor rooms are equipped with both indoor and outdoor showers, and the outdoor shower is landscaped with tropical plants. Television selections are extremely limited, but nobody goes to Hawaii to watch TV.    Room service food selections are decent as far as number of choices, not over the top, but not really sparse either. The portions are enormous, and splitting is a smart option. I recommend the roast chicken. Except for dinner at Beach Tree Grill and breakfast buffet, we actually split most meals. The turkey club sandwich is so large, I couldn't finish half of it, and my husband had trouble with his half. We split a wrap one day and neither of us could finish our half. Food is really expensive if you insist on ordering your own meal. Sandwiches are around $24 each (but they feed 2), smoothies are $10 each, alcoholic beverages generally start at $14, and the keiki (kid's) menu prices range from $9 to $13 (but kids under 4 eat at the breakfast buffet for free). Breakfast buffet is $32 for adults and $13 for children over 4. Entree prices at BTG range from $29 to $59 for the paella for two. Entree prices at Pahu'i'a range from $32 to I believe over $50, and Hualalai Grill is 5-star prices, so expect a $300+ tab for dinner for two. Appetizers are as much as the entrees, and as large, so be careful, you may order way too much food. With dessert and a bevy of cocktails (virgin and alcoholic) at BTG, expect $150. If you have one cocktail and skip dessert, you can get out for under $100 for dinner. Also, room service actually expects you to split meals and asks up front how many people are going to be eating. They don't blink about it in the restaurants, either. At the pools, they actually split the meals into two bento boxes if you say you're splitting.    Service at two of the restaurants, Beach Tree Grill and the Hualalai Grill, is top-notch, but service at Pahu'i'a needs improvement. Our first night at the resort, we ended up leaving the restaurant before a waiter even stopped by with water. We were there over 20 minutes. Breakfast service was mixed. One morning service was terrible, but most mornings it was very good. At Beach Tree Grill, one server, Nastashia, was a delight. She really went out of her way, helped us order a craving off-menu, and even had a little fun making virgin cocktails for me. She's technically in the bar, FYI. The entertainment at BTG was relaxing and several children played in the sand while their parents enjoyed dinner. The sand area was well-lit so you could keep a good eye on the kids and they didn't disturb other diners. Our daughter made several new friends both at BTG and at the pools.    Everyone makes a point of greeting guests with an ""aloha"" every time they see you walking around the grounds. There are abundant washers and dryers provided for guest convenience, gratis. Ice water is refilled at the pools so frequently that if the ice melts, someone comes by and changes it. The servers periodically stop by with cold towels, Evian mist, watermelon, and popsicles to refresh the guests. The pool water is tepid (except King's Pond) and very pleasant for swimming. King's Pond is freezing cold, but feeding the eagle ray was a highlight of the trip for our daughter. There are wild green sea turtles frolicking in the ocean by the lava rocks just off the beach. There are enough lounge chairs so that if you want two, one in the shade and one in the sun, you'll likely be accommodated without hesitation. There are tons of pool toys for the kids to play with. Everyone at the resort treated our daughter as an individual, asking her what she wanted for dinner, speaking to her directly if she had a question, making sure she had everything she needed, and she felt like a princess.    Honeymooners and guests without children are generally placed in rooms away from the family-oriented areas, so they are given an experience that is as child-free as possible on a family-friendly resort. We noticed this as we walked the property. The gym and spa are set away from the bungalows, and the gym is truly state of the art. There are separate cardio rooms and weight rooms. The free weights are actually outside, which my husband loved. The lap pool is in a very quiet area, and was a good size.    One thing we enjoyed most was being able to actually see the belt of the Milky Way in the night sky as we walked the foot paths (they have miles of them, including 3 jogging routes that are great). I recommend you explore every inch of the resort. You might be surprised at what turns out to be the best memories.    Other than a disappointing experience at Pahu'i'a, the only other minor inconvenience is common to all of the resorts in the area -- it's pretty far from everything else. Waikoloa is a 30 minute drive, Kailua-Kona is a 20-30 minute drive, Hilo is 2 hours away, the Volcano is 2.5 to 3 hours away. But it is the Big Island. Everything is far away from everything else.    We've already recommended this resort to friends who will be going in December, and we know they will enjoy their stay as much as we did.",Oct 2009,October 2009,Traveled with family,,"Tokyo, Japan"
46490612,50,I could stay there forever,"We chose the Four Seasons because they take very good care of children and they had a great promotion running with a credit of 1000 for every four nights stayed. That basically pays for your meals if you don't go over the top every day. The music provided by the Beach Tree Restaurant each evening was excellent. The kids and adults loved it alike. There is an open area by the stage where the kids can play while the adults finish their dinner or drinks at the lounge area. ""Super job on the renovation here""  The rooms are comfortable and spacious vs the rest of the hotels on the island. I was however surprised by the lack of view you get when you are located on the bottom floor of the bungalows. The bottom floor is great however if you want to walk out to the pool from your room or the kids want to play on the lawn. Breakfast at Pahua was just average vs the FS Maui. The pools are incredible. Adult and childrens equally. Forget the beach. You do not want to come here if you love to play on the beach. Teh surf is rough and definately not designed for kids. There is however a wonderful walkway along the beach that we enjoyed daily. And you can't beat the tradewinds.

There is an intimacy to the resort that you do not get at other properties (such as the Maui Four Seasons which is great but nothing like Hualalai). It is true that the beach is not a great swimming beach - this is the only downside to the resort. But so much is so good. You pay a lot, but you certainly get a lot.

45094415,50,Best resort for a romantic getaway,"My husband & I just spent 10 days at the 4seasons for our 20th annivers. Everything was fabulous---from check in but check out. They have the best concierge department--they call you before you arrive so you can make plans. When we got there our trips were all arranged & the best was everything can be placed on our room charge. The rooms are great & every evening you get a choice from 4 different aromatherapy scents. Have a lower room gets you the outdoor shower---which is a must. Our room was located in the King's Pond area----very quiet & NO KIDS. We had our annivers. dinner at Pahu i'a & the concierge arranged the best table & special lei's for us. Pahu i'a now offers a special 3course fix prix dinner(well worth the price) but breakfast is still way too much. They offer free coffee & muffins in the lobby from 5-7am( you are not informed of this). It is worth getting up early since the sun rises by 6am & sets by 630pm daily. The have several great jogging trails. There is a fab. cultural center on site---it is a must to check & take a class---it is free. The spa has been completely redone & the Apothecary treatments are worth the cost. The pools are the best infinity pools around & there are 2 pools with NO KIDS.

We did the Mauna Kea Summit star-gazing tour, the doors off heliocoptor tour over the volcano(paradise tours in Hilo), & the zip-line tour over waterfalls. All of these tours were excellent.  Having a car is a must on this island----reserve the car before you arrive. The least expensive gas is at Costco---7miles from the resort & 1 mile from the airport.

43389726,50,Absolutely wonderful! The perfect place to relax by the ocean!,"My husband and I recently stayed at the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai for our honeymoon. Everything was perfect! The rooms were spacious and clean, the bathroom was large and beautiful, the staff was incredibly friendly and the resort grounds were immaculate.    We were originally suppose to spend five days at the Four Seasons Hualalai and then five days at the Four Seasons Maui, but when we got to the hotel in Maui, we essentially stayed the night and left the next day to go back to Hualalai. The Four Seasons Hualalai and the Four Seasons Maui are VERY different resorts. Hualalai is much more peaceful and spread out, and while it’s smaller that the resort in Maui in terms of the number of guests, it somehow feels much larger in terms of the grounds. Don’t get me wrong, the Maui property is lovely, but it feels more like a traditional hotel (high rise building, more crowded pools, etc).    While there were a number of children staying at the Four Seasons Hualalai, our room was located in a very quiet area by the adult only pool. It was always very peaceful here so I definitely recommend asking for a room in this area if you are looking for something a little more secluded. I also recommend requesting a second floor room. Because we unexpectedly returned to Hualalai after departing early from Maui, we had to stay one night in a lower level room by the more kid friendly pool. While these rooms have a lovely outdoor shower, it’s much quieter on the second level.    All of the dining at the resort was terrific. The Beach Tree is much more casual and kid friendly. The Pahu i’a has a beautiful view of the ocean and serves a delicious brunch and dinner. The Hualalai Grille is also very nice and probably felt the most “adult” of all three restaurants. Then there is also the Lava Lounge which has great cocktails and sushi.    Our whole experience at the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai was wonderful from the moment we arrived.

Great restaurants.  Negatives:  I don't care if you have kids or not, STAY AWAY from the kids pool. Our room was close to it and kids started making noise from 6:00 AM( pools are open 24 hours). Another thing to consider, this is 2 story bungalow resort. It is not very well sound proof. Unless you are OK with listening to the terrace door opening and closing 100 times day and night on top of your head plus possible kids jumping and running, try to get a room on the higher floor. You can't call the front desk and complain about the guest on the second floor opening the balcony doors to enjoy the midnight breeze, watch the sunrise( 0530am), talk on cell phone and etc , can you? So, it is the best to stay on the top floor. $21+ tax +tip for a glass of simple Martini at Beach tree bar. $18+ tax + tip for a Mojito. $20+tax+tip for a glass of average white wine.

40624164,50,Four Seasons Hualalai Is the Very Definition of Paradise on Earth,"We have just returned from a 10 day stay at Hualalai. We were so high on this resort after our first visit four years ago, we were worried that we would be disappointed this time. Not the case--in fact, the resort was even nicer than our memory recalled. We stayed in an ocean view room in the Palm Grove Section--same room as last time. I really believe the ocean view room is the best value for the money. The view is really beautiful. Also, if you are a couple traveling alone looking for privacy and quiet, the Palm Grove Section is the place to be. The downstairs rooms have the outside shower, which is almost a reason in and of itself to stay at this hotel. The room itself is very nicely apportioned and recently updated. After the first night we requested a firmer bed, and they replaced the entire mattress for us. This was emblematic of the level of serivce they provide. Also, I had an allergic reaction when I was there, the concierge arranged for a phone call consult with a doctor at no cost--again quite amazing. We spent considerable time at the beachtree adult infinity pool which is simply mesmerizing. The pool itself is gorgeous with ample cabanas and umbrella covered seats. The entire service experience is top notch in all respects. The views of the ocean from the pool deck are simply amazing. The snorkeling pond pool was also a big hit. It is amazing of the quality of snorkeling experience you can obtain while staying on the property. The pool at the Palm Grove section is very quite and secluded, has seductive day beds and hammocks. Very private, quiet and romantic. The spa is also amazing. The recent renovations adding the stone garden with fountain are amazing. The extra treatment rooms outside are a big hit. The lap pool is ideal for a morning workout. The exericse room facilities are hard to believe givent their breadth and number of options--both inside and outside! The complimentary morning fitness walk is an excellent way to begin the day. The tennis cour facilities are also quite nice. The coffee company outpost near the tennis courts offers a nice coffee pastry alternative to breakfast in the restaurant. The restaurants were all very nice. Beach Tree had a fabulous lunch menu we loved. (And is a great location to watch the magical sunsets.) Pauia remains top notch. The Grille is not as good as we remembered but was still fine. The new Italaian menu at the Beach Tree at night is an interesting development. The restaurant had recently opened when we were there and I think with time, the Italian concept could be quite interesting. On balance, it is hard to imagine any beach resort offering a better experience. The resort is simply stunning in natural beauty. The architecture adds to the beauty by having the rooms in two story bungalows spread across the property instead of a massive central building. The walk from one end of the resort to the other may take you more than ten minutes to give a glimpse as to how spread out the resort really is. The service personnel make every aspect of they stay quite enjoyable. I would strongly recommend this resort to anyone whose budget allows. I am already planning our return trip.",Sep 2009,September 2009,Traveled as a couple,,US
38818122,50,Wow...great retreat!,"This is my first time to this Four Seasons resort and all the renovations that were happening around the Beach Tree Restaurant were finished. We booked a two island trip and our first stop is on the Big Island. We actually arrived quite early so our room was not ready when we arrived. Once we arrived, we were ushered to the lobby lounge area to the couches where we received our leis, refreshments, and treats. Since our room was not ready, they asked for a cell number so that they can call us when our room was ready. We then wandered off to explore this beautiful and remote resort. Our first stop was to check out the King's pond where you can snorkel in a safe environment with lots of native fish. When we were there, the keikis from the Kids for All Seasons were there feeding the resident Eagle Ray and he was a very friendly Ray that allowed the kids to pet him. My daughter was also given a chance to feed the Ray and she was definitely thrilled to have an opportunity like that. There are two feeding during the day; one at 10:30 for the other fish and one at 1pm for the Ray. There were folks snorkeling when we visited the area and it was definitely a very cool pond!    We then wandered over to the Sea Shell family pool and this pool is almost like an infinity pool and it was very large and we actually really like this pool area. The pool attendants setup some nice chairs under the thatched cabanas around the pool, we received our call that our room was ready. Since we were with our daughter, we received a wonderful ocean-view lower bungalow right in this Sea Shell area. The gem with the first floor rooms is the awesome outdoor shower that actually makes your room look larger. Needless to say that we used that outdoor shower all the time and from time to time, you might get a few stray visitors who might stare at you while you're out there. These were harmless geckos so no worries of actually having other people see you bathing. The Four Seasons definitely takes care of the youngest of guests and my daughter received welcome gifts such one of the Four Seasons resorts stuffed animals and a sweet treat from the pastry staff. Mom and Dad also received welcome goodies such as macadamia nuts, a delicious banana bread-like confection, and some beverages. Another great thing about this resort is that they have these great high efficiency washer and dryers with detergent for you to do your laundry. There are laundry rooms peppered throughout the resort so this will be helpful to all families traveling.    The pools....yes, there are three main pools such as the Beach Tree pool, the Sea Shell pool, and the King's pond. There is also a secluded Palm Grove area that I believe most honeymooners stay because it is very secluded and there is one small pool and a good sized hot tub area. When we arrived, all the construction appeared to be completed as the Beach Tree Restaurant was open for business. The food at this restaurant was very good and tasty! In the evening, they even set aside a fire pit and smore's ingredients for you to make this wonderful treat. There is also musical entertainment and if your kids are not shy, they can be called up to do a hula dance with the resident expert.    The Pahu I'a restaurant is where breakfast is served every morning. Great views if you sit outside and you might even see spinner dolphins as you eat your breakfast! The breakfast buffet is pretty good but I still think the Four Seasons in Maui has a larger breakfast buffet spread.    The beach area is not as nice as Wailea Beach but there is somewhat of a beach with a seawall that protects swimmers from the wild waves further out. The sand here is coarse and they have water socks for you to borrow as you wade into the water. There are spiny sea urchins as well as pieces of dead coral that you don't want to step on otherwise you'll receive some out of ouchie on your feet. During the morning, we actually got to see sea turtles swimming in the water in the beach area. FS staff members also state that the turtles love to sunbathe on the beaches on the resort.    For you fitness fans, this resort has an awesome fitness facility with some great tennis courts onsite and a lap pool. So no excuse to not exercise while you're on vacation when you come here.    The atmosphere here on this resort is very quiet and secluded. It was very different from the Maui resort. I love the fact that for families, you do not need to get up at the crack of dawn to stake out your cabana spot for the day. For us, it was a very relaxing and quiet resort and we are sure glad to have had a chance to finally come to this resort. The area is definitely very beautiful and we definitely would love to come back for a future visit.",Aug 2009,August 2009,Traveled with family,,SF Bay Area
35988579,50,Still the best ...,"We are staying at the 4 Seasons Hualalai right now for 8 days. This is our 3rd trip here. Our room faces the Sea Shell Pool. We do not see nor hear any construction. The service and experience is the same as it ever was. I love that every employee says hello to you when they see you. I love the free laundry rooms. I love that they are SO kid friendly. And I love that they will cater to your every need.    We do notice that - probably because of the economy - the resort is not as crowded as previous summers. Food selections also seem to be a little less - only one night buffet, breakfast buffet doesn't seem as abundant.    We try to call for housekeeping when we leave our room - instead of waiting for them to get to us. This ensures that our room is clean when we return - important when traveling with a 4 year old (he naps, and we are also in the room ALOT)    I love how the room smells nice. I love the kid's shampoo and bubble bath. I love the little stuff animal they leave.    It is the same usual wonderful here. I can't wait to return.",Jul 2009,July 2009,Traveled with family,,"San Francisco, CA"
35968229,50,Paradise!!! But comes at a cost,"Wow, this resort is in a class of its own. We have traveled around the world, but this has been our favorite, most luxurious hotel. From the second you enter the property, you know that you are someplace special. The grounds are IMMACULATE, with barely a leaf out of place. This is a HUGE resort, with every amenity imaginable; I do not even know where to begin.  The staff: The staff is so friendly, warm and helpful, even the gardeners say “Aloha!” when you walk by. Everyone seems to know your name. The staff at the pool greet you, set you up with towels, lounge chairs and the exact amount of shade or sun that you desire, and then come by frequently to refill your ice water, give you cold towels, clean your sunglasses, give you a fresh towel, offer you something from the menu, etc. The restaurants provide outstanding service and attention to detail.  The room: Our room was extremely comfortable- soft, comfortable sheets, large flatscreen TV and DVD player, L’Occitane bath amenities, empty frig, coffee machine and toaster, large closet, separate toilet, huge sunken tub, and our favorite, the outdoor shower. The turn down service in the evening came at strange times- sometimes at 4pm, sometimes after 9pm, so we did not get to take full advantage of that every day since we were often in the room when they came.  Amenities: This resort has IT ALL. Complimentary laundry was fantastic, and since your clothes get so dirty from sweat and sunscreen, it was really useful. The gym is unbelievable- fantastic, new machines, excellent weight machines, free weights, classes, and then fruit, water and Gatorade. There were FIVE different pools- 3 of them we went to nearly every day- the lap pool, the large quiet pool and the King’s Pond, which is a snorkel pool, fully stocked with tropical fish and salt water. We do not golf, but the course looked gorgeous and never crowded.  The restaurants are OUTSTANDING- some of the best meals that we've ever had.  There were SO MANY special extras here, such as a complimentary s’mores “bar” every night (a firepit in the sand with a table of all of the fixins), a protected turtle area, where we saw turtles resting every day, a gorgeous beach with protected swim area, easy and free self-parking, a great jogging trail with various length choices, a basketball court, I could go on and on and on. We came for our 1 year wedding annivesary, and we received so many well wishes from the staff, a sweet card, champagne and desserts in the room, and our first dinner there they brought us a special dessert.  However, you pay a heavy price for all of the above. Room rates are VERY high, and although a lot is included in the room rate, the prices for additional activities, food, etc. is outrageously high. For example, a group hike organized by the sports club, which includes a picnic lunch, walk through lava tube, etc. is $105 per person. A SIDE Caesar salad, with just lettuce, croutons and anchovies, is nearly $20. A mai tai at the pool is $15. Breakfast buffet (which is one of the best breakfast buffets I’ve ever had) is $32 per person. Needless to say, these costs add up very quickly, and given all of the fabulous parts of this resort, you never want to leave, so you end up staying on the property the whole time and thus racking up a considerable bill. I suppose this is just the cost of staying in paradise!  With regards to the construction, we stayed in a room far from any construction, and were not bothered by it at all. Granted, there are workers and machines on the premises, but it seemed like they were doing their absolute best to keep it as contained as possible. It did not take away from our experience (this was our first time there and do not have anything to compare it to). Also, it looked like the construction of the Beach Trill Bar and Grill, next to the pool, was wrapping up as we left.",Jul 2009,July 2009,Traveled as a couple,,Los Angeles
34226772,50,Perfect Resort Vacation,"My new wife and I spent our Honeymoon at the Kona Four Seasons at the end of June - and its darned close to the perfect report vacation. I had read MANY of the reviews on the site, and I was a little nervous about the construction. As it turns out, there was no need to worry. Yes, construction is indeed in full swing at the resort, but its in a couple areas, only disrupts one of 4 pools, and a small section of rooms (and that set of buildings are completely blocked off).    My advice - eat at the restaurants, morning - noon - and night, they're incredible. Hang out at the ""quiet pool"" - there couldn't be a better place for a book and a tropical drink. If you like a good gym use theirs, its the best hotel gym I've ever seen. Ask for a room with an outdoor shower. Go to the Manta Ray feeding - its very cool. And, get ready for some of the most impressive customer service you've ever experienced. Oh, and be prepared to spend a good deal of $, as expected from a four season, everything comes at a (large) cost - but its all well worth it!",Jul 2009,June 2009,Traveled as a couple,,"Kentfield, California"
33324346,50,Disregard the negative reviews about construction from uptight people,"First of all, don't let the negative comments about the construction bother you. Our poolside room was located just two buildings down from some of the units they were renovating, yet it never got too noisy or obtrusive.    Stayed here for two nights to end our Big Island trip in April. At the time, they had a Spring special going on that included unlimited golf and one spa treatment per day of your stay! Can you say no-brainer?? We ended up leaving the Waikoloa Marriott early and staying here instead! The front desk staff were incredibly pleasant to deal with and very helpful.    I played two rounds while I was here. The golf course is in pretty good shape, very scenic, and not too difficult. The staff are fantastic, and very helpful. The spa facilities are first-rate, as are the fitness room, which was the most comprehensively-equipped hotel gym I've ever seen! Even if you don't get a spa treatment, you can enjoy the facilities, which I did while my wife was enjoying her treatments.    The grounds are exceptional, as is the eagle ray pond. Be sure to catch the daily ray feedings. There's really no beach for swimming, but rather an enclosed seawater pool suitable for swimming. We had the seafood buffet dinner at the oceanfront restaurant, which was of course rather expensive. We thought the food was just very good, but not superb, which is what we would expect from a FS restaurant. Just pass on the ""fillers"" and eat the good stuff!    The property has two very nice pools. The one to the north is the main infinity pool, which can get crowded because yes, this Four Seasons is very family-friendly. The other pool is to the south which is much more relaxing and tranquil.    The only drawback to the property is that there's nothing close to it! No walking to nearby restaurants or markets. We ended up driving fifteen minutes to Waikoloa if we needed anything.    All in all a fantastic property, and we can't wait to get back....maybe with our first kid?",Jun 2009,April 2009,Traveled as a couple,,"Campbell, CA"
32848309,40,"Fabulous hotel, but construction brings it down a notch","My husband and I just returned from five days in Kona at the Four Seasons and we had a fabulous time at this beautiful resort BUT, beware of the construction as other posts have indicated. I still recommend this property overall, however for the price, it may not be worth it in it's current state (hence the 4/5 star rating). There is construction everywhere...from right outside the spa, to various rooms that are being refurbished throughout the resort (not just certain wings, but it seemed there were rooms within every wing under construction), to the beach tree grill. It's just clearly a resort under major enhancement/construction so I wish I had known the extent of it before booking. I, too, was really looking forward to the peace and calm of the adult pool (our 2-year old stayed at home with Grandma!!), but was very disappointed to hear the loud construction going on each day right next door to it. When I booked, I did read on the site that the Beach Tree Grill was being ""enhanced"" and would not be available, but was not at all concerned as I knew there were other dining options on property. However, the fact that this restaurant is right next to the adult pool, and that construction occurred day in and day out, with jack hammers, pounding, etc was disappointing. We made the best of it and just enjoyed the beach-side chairs and then the family pool which was still very nice, but not what we had hoped for (or paid the steep price for).    On a positive side, the rooms are typical Four Seasons standards, large, wonderful linens, great service. Check-in was a very pleasant experience and the staff was very helpful throughout the entire trip. Dinner at Pahuia was fabulous, and we also enjoyed the casual Pahuia lanai, as well as the lounge on the 2nd floor. Great drinks, appetizers, etc. I'd also recommend snorkeling in the lagoon outside the family pool, it was a nice, protected place to do some ocean swimming and snokeling (just watch out for the rocks on the ocean floor!)    My husband and I have been avid Four Seasons Maui fans, and typically visit that property twice/year so this was our first time at the Four Seasons Kona. If I had to give my honest review, I'd prefer the Maui resort. The beach at Wailea is much nicer (albeit busier)...but don't go to the Kona resort and expect an overly fine, sandy beach. There are rocks scattered throughout. It's still gorgeous, but just consistent with the lava and rocks that you find throughout the Kona beaches, whereas the Maui beaches are all sandy, easy to run along and you don't have to worry about stepping all over rough rocks.    All in all, though, we did really enjoy the Four Seaons Kona. However I think we'll be booking back at the Four Seaons Maui, vs making another repeat trip to Kona in the near future.",Jun 2009,June 2009,Traveled as a couple,,Seattle
32458079,50,the most amazing week of my life ever,"before traveling to hawaii, i read every review about this resort and was very worried about the construction complained of by other reviewers. yes, there was construction by the quiet pool and yes it was loud and distracting. however, there is another, equally gorgeous pool, that is silent, on the beach, and has full service.    i could easily spend thousands of words writing about how amazing this resort is but i will tear up with sorrow because i'm not there any more. the rooms were beautiful. the grounds were impecible. the staff were genuine, friendly, and exceptionally helpful. the food was incredible and i don't even think that word does it justice.    snorking in kings pond was fun but taking the snorkle gear to the ocean was awesome.    without a doubt, this was the nicest resort i've ever been to. i will be dreaming about it until li can return.",Jun 2009,June 2009,Traveled as a couple,,PA
32319156,50,Pure Bliss even with the construction,"I feel that I have to defend this place from previous reviewers. Don't listen to the reviews below mine. The construction DOES exist and yes it is a minor distraction but by no means does it take away from what a blissful place the Hualalai property is. The construction took away from one pool - there were three other amazing options! It took away maybe 1.5% out of 100% of my overall happy state during my five nights at the resort - that is it!    When we arrived we were escorted into the main lobby where we were seated and given cold hand towels, lei's and a mai tai. Our room was a prime ocean view with an amazing view of the ocean and had a huge lanai. The room had been recently renovated and was very comfortable and had a nice Hawaiian vibe to it without overdoing it. We loved the room but mostly because of the lanai and how it brought the outside in. We never didn't have the lanai door open when we were in the room.    The resort itself is very zen, peaceful and blissed out. I've never been more relaxed in my life. Everything is done discreetly - maid service, the lawn guys outside, room service attendants, etc. so as not to disturb your relaxation. Every guest seemed to be lulled into a semi coma state of happiness. I was worried there would be arrogant people roaming around on their blackberries and kids screaming and throwing sand everywhere but that was not the case. Everyone seemed to be enjoying it as much as we were.    The food in every instance (room service and restaurants throughout) was amazing. Normally room service doesn't impress me in hotels but we ended up having breakfast on our lanai every day because it was so private and just plain wonderful to look out over the ocean in our FSR robes that were provided to the room.    Service was impeccable, warm and geninue. Because we were on our honeymoon we booked a very special dinner on the beach with a private server (a fortune but something we will never forget) and it was the highlight of our trip. The pool side service was also amazing and something that has spoiled me forever. They set up your chairs for you with towels and water, bring around cold hand towels, more water, Evian spritz's and will clean your sunglasses for you. We put our rental in valet every day out of pure laziness but the benefit of this is that the car is pulled up to the main entrance for you, with cold water ready for you and directions and towels on hand if you need them.    The pools and beach were great. The ocean was very clear and we saw a ton of turtles! Spa was also just renovated and very beautiful. I had a pineapple scrub and a mani/pedi. I normally don't find nail services relaxing but it was so much so that I fell asleep in the special chairs they have!    This is a very expensive place but my husband who hates spending money even said this was worth every penny. We will definitly be back as soon as possible. If you like peace and luxury in one spot - it doesn't get any better.",Jun 2009,May 2009,Traveled as a couple,,Chicago
32315094,50,An ultimate escape,"This is one of the best hotels you will ever stay at - even with the construction.  Location - yes, it is a bit remote, but only about a 20 minute drive to the city of Kona (South), the Waikoloa resort area (North), and a bit over an hour of beautiful scenery to some of the most incredible hikes and valleys anywhere. It is an incredible luxury, however, to find this kind of remoteness on any of the Hawaiian islands. At least during the shoulder season, it was like being on your own private island, and if you're looking for nature, luxury, and escape, I don't know why you'd want to be on a beach with ten other monster resorts. Further, the resort is beautifully landscaped and has a fantastic beach that feels more like three beaches in one.  Service - impeccable. Typical Four Seasons except perhaps a bit less 'stuffy' than at other locations.  Rooms - I don't think one could get a bad room. We had both a ground floor (which has the benefit of a lava rock shower. Not as awesome as it could have been but a very nice feature that also made the room feel more open); and a second floor room (also very nice, with slightly highr ceilings and a more open deck versus the slightly enclosed feeling patio on the ground floor).  Amenities - This is a real clincher for top ratings at this resort. From the coffee and in-room toaster to the free laundry and internet (in the lobby); from the snorkelling equipment and sunscreen and beachside service (chocolate coated icecream) to the dvd library, this resort has all the little extra touches. There is also an adorable 'general store' on site where you can buy breakfast and lucnh things if you wish to eat on your patio or whatever. It is this autonomy that adds to the feeling of escape. You aren't rendered reliant on hotel staff, though they are always available to cater to your needs.  The only downsides to be aware of are that yes, it is expensive. However, it is a beachfront Four Seasons resort. That's how it works. Also, the construction. It is a bit smelly sometimes, and when there's no wind or surf, it can get a bit noisy. However, there is a big beach, and more than one pool, so it can be avoided. We were very concerned about this before going, but were not in any way bothered by it - of course our room was at the King's Pond (awesome) and we stayed by the Seashell pool (which was our favourite despite the kids).  I just can't say enough about how positive our experience was here. I can't wait to return.",Jun 2009,June 2009,Traveled as a couple,,Switzerland

30531492,40,"If you want the best on the Big Island, stay here.","This resort is the best on the island--by far. While the others manage to have a Las Vegas feel, the 4S Hualalai manages to exude the Hawaiian experience throughout--the rooms, the landscape and the friendliness of the staff. The only complaint is the construction which takes place by the main adult pool during the week. They should at least lower their prices or offer credits to use for golf or the spa during construction as it can get loud while you're trying to relax by the pool and soak in your sprtiz of Evian and sip your citrus infused water. Oh, my husband reminded me of the spearmint infused cold towels that they give you poolside. How could I have forgotten that!    If it weren't for the construction and the lack of price reductions or credits due to it, I would have given it a 5 star.    Be sure to check out the green turtles in the lagoon and go for a snorkel in the Kings Pond to visit the Eagle Rays. And say Hi to Dave at the Beach Cafe. He's a great bartendar. Get the Fried Calamari with Maui onion rings and a Mai Tai. Watch the surf come in and out and the sun go down.

30431005,50,Part of our honeymoon - fantastic breakfast but disappointing beach!,"We stopped at this resort for one week on our way to French Polynesia. if you are a frequent 4Seasons hotel guest, you know what to expect.    The hotel: super large complex with the beach, golf, trails etc. Several restaurants, bars, enough not to get bored with the food selection. Beautifully done grounds, several sections with pools, ponds etc. Suitable to families as well as couples as you can find your privacy there even when the hotel is fully booked. The resort is slopping down from a small hill down to the ocean, making the higher located reception area pretty impressive.    The area: This is the Big Island, very deserted and volcanic. The volcano has been active for years and you can see the lava on the other side flowing to the sea. Worth renting a car and making a trip around.    Beach: BE AWARE, THIS IS NOT A RESORT FOR THE BEACH!!! There is a very small, disappointing beach area. The volcanic sediments are everywhere, no view, just a few chairs. Everybody was using the pool, which was great. We didn't mind as we wanted to venture around and on our way to Bora Bora anyway.    Rooms: large but a bit tired. Not really in a bad way, just a bit out of style. no problem though.    Pools: one for adults, separate area for kids (far from adults), jacuzzi for adults, pond with fish and rays.    Restaurant - the food was great and the breakfast was one of the best I ever had. the selection was unbelievable! Unfortunately, there was a massive bird problem where you were fighting for your muffin with dozens of birds every morning as the area was open. but, who can blame the birds, it was that delicious!

30186513,40,"Great resort, again, especially after the crowd leave","Returned again, with the entire crowd in trail---for 12 days in April 2009---and then added others, so that at one point, we were 11 adults and 6 kids. Woo Hoo!  Rough points first: Four Seasons is quite rightly doing lots and lots of construction during the downturn in the economy; the general manager has been quoted as saying they were running at something like 54% occupancy when they would normally be filled completely. They are adding lots of suites, rebuilding the Beach Tree Grill, doing something near the Spa and Amphitheatre, etc etc etc. I think they have taken rooms near the construction out of circulation---but there's no way to limit the ""beep, beep, beep"" of a backing up piece of construction equipment near the ""adult"" pool that runs through the middle of the resort---so the ""quiet"" pool isn't going to be quiet for sometime yet (I would guess the Beach Tree reconstruction will be done in October, 2009).  Also, everything said in my previous review about the nature of the resort when Spring Break crowds are upon it versus the veritable Zen-like calmness after they leave is all still true.  The section of beach and little lagoon right in front of the main pool area isn't actually a great ocean swimming beach.  Finally, pricing remains somewhat silly if you apply normal, mainland costs to anything. Just pay it and grin.    On the great side: staff remains really, really kid-friendly. The kiddie pool (with the turtle umbrella and synthetic sand beach) is great. The big pool still has its sheltered kiddie ""plateaus"". For ocean swimming, walk down the beach to the much-superior Beach Hut and beach at Kona Village---along the way, stop to say hello to the moray eel that lives in the tide pool---not TOO close; that guy was as thick as my arm and nice, shiny white teeth. The Kona Village beach (owned by the Dell folks who now own Hualalai) has snorkeling, stand up paddling, sailing in the afternoons, etc etc etc---and is just a better protected and more amusing place to be in the ocean---Get some exercise! Your Four Seasons charge will work at the Beach Hut.  Finally (after two stays and about 20 days of visits) got a chance to golf here---Wow! Hawaii golf at its best. The ocean views were amazing; bring an extra sleeve of balls---volcanic rock is incredibly difficult to find a miss-hit ball in and you don't really want to be crawling around in it because it's so jagged anyway. They rental Taylor-made clubs and they are very nice sets indeed.  Make it to the Saturday night buffet (not really a Luau) on the beach; reserve a beach table for you and yours; let the kids play in the sand at your feet while you eat lobster tail, sushi (fresh!) and have a chocolate souffle. Death by calories. Watch the girls hula dance with the hula lady when the live band comes out. Make some Some-mores with the kids afterwards at their beach grill station; die again by chocolate overdose.  --If you're there over the Easter Holiday, reserve a spot at the Easter Egg hunt (there are two; one for the under five crowd and one for the over); there will be a petting zoo too! For purposes of Hawaii, we explained that the Easter Gecko had left many presents for everyone. The kids were amused.    If you are going to shred $100 bills at a luxury resort, I can't see why it wouldn't be this one. We'll go again next year---if the funds hold out.    Some notes:  ---They've moved the Cultural Center and the dress shop that were under the main lobby; and all resort supplied computer/internet access (other than in your room) is now from laptops in the main lobby.  ---About the construction: You know, if you happen to have a young boy who loves Builder Bob (you know who you are), the presence of Backhoes, Excavators and Hi-Lifts is NOT a problem while you're on vacation---we were able to find a way to get a great, clear vantage on the embankment overlooking the construction site and my son rather happily ""supervised"" everyone for hours at a time.  ---You're on vacation; hire a back-up nanny to help mind the kids around the pool; it will cost you $15 hour or something like that. Get one for everyday, for at least 8 hours a day. The locals need the pay---your wife needs the break. Some are great, some are only OK; if they aren't working out for your family, trade-in for another. The concierge can set all this up for you before you get there.  ---For those of you with less than perfect vision, go to ""Snorkel Bob's"" after you leave the airport, which is near the Costco about 10 minutes from the airport, but in the opposite direction from the hotel; google for directions. They stock and will rent diopter corrected diving masks so that all the pretty fish snap into focus when you are underwater; they can accommodate about 8 diopters of near or far sightedness. Hurray! No contact issues in the water.  ---If you have little kids, also rent a boogie board with a ""glass porthole""; then, assuming you are a good swimmer, you can push them around the little lagoon and the King's pond and they can look down at the fish without having to sort out the logistics of breathing through a snorkel. This will amuse them.  ---If you get a rental car, the Borders in town (Kona) is pretty good for restocking kiddie amusements for the flight home  ---For cabin fever, you can run up to Queen's Shops at the Hilton Waikaloa (assuming rental car again). They have a Starbucks (which is going to close, by rumor, because the recession is killing business) and a new Gourmet Market with all sorts of regular stuff. The shops in this mall and King's Shops, across the street from Queen's (logically) sell great island trinkets (you know, the stuff you bring back for all your kid's classmates, etc); Hawaii pencils, erasers, etc. Also, floaties and inflatable balls if you need that stuff too.    For great bargains this summer, with a great beach and in the same area, check out the website for Kona Village; unbelievably, they are offering $330/night all-inclusive for a 5 night minimum (did I read this wrong?) AND $800 back on your airfare. It won't be the Four Seasons---but at that price, it may not matter.",May 2009,April 2009,Traveled with family,,"San Francisco, CA"

We have traveled to lots of places, and stayed at some amazing places. Nothing, and I mean ""nothing"" I have ever experienced topped the feelings we savored, during our stay, and now cherish for the rest of our lives!

The resort really knows how to take care of its guests. The staff was attentive and unassuming. There was a bit of construction being done on some of the rooms but it really didn't affect our overall experience. We loved the free laundry facilities located throughout the resort and made use of them. It was great to fly home with clean clothes. The hotel is expensive, but you do get what you paid for in terms of cleanliness and amenities. We stayed in a ground floor room with the beautiful outdoor shower surrounded by orchids.

The hotel rooms - great. The ameniities - world class. The hotel is very kid friendly. The spa is not best in class - but pretty darn good. There is a lot of construction going on right now. That was a bit of a distraction - and the hotel is doing everything they can to mask it - but you can hear and see it while hanging out at the SeaShell pool and as you walk around the property.

24387068,50,A very romantic place to get engaged!,"We were fortunate enough to stay here in July of 2008 and August of 2007 (sorry for the late review!). The resort is truly one of the most beautiful and peaceful places we have ever been to. Watching the sun set over the Pacific as the tiki torches are being lit definitely alleviates all the stresses of the mainland. In short, if you have the opportunity to stay here, we recommend it 100%.  Resting sea turtles are ample, and they often come out in the late afternoon. We got engaged on the beach, next to the sea turtles (but not too close—we’re rule followers) as the sun was setting. At the risk of sounding cheesy, it was definitely dream-like and something we will always remember. Four Seasons staff and fellow guests made our engagement even more special. We definitely recommend Alan Wong’s Grille and Pahuia, although Pahuia is a bit over-priced. Also, definitely order the short ribs at Alan Wong’s..nothing can ever compare to them! For lunch, we preferred the member’s restaurant (hotel guests are allowed for lunch), and it offers a better deal than any of the other restaurants at the resort .We went to the smoothie and sandwich station next to the general store. We noticed that FS doesn’t really advertise that you can get sandwiches here, but they are so good, and half of what you’d pay at the pool restaurant. Both times we had an upstairs room and enjoyed looking out at the Paciific, but I’d love to try the outdoor shower next time. The washer and dryer facilities are ample, free, and a plus (especially if you are clumsy while drinking red wine).  Our first trip in 2007 the resort was markedly busier. Our one complaint: there were 2 occasions we had to be put on the wait list for the pool. While the pool staff was always very nice and accommodating, at this price point we felt that having to be put on a wait list for a beach chair is unacceptable. However, this problem did not exist during our most recent visit in August of 2008. The resort was definitely less busy as they were remodeling some rooms, and were only operating at 60% capacity. I hope that they can control their occupancy so there is no wait list for the pool and the grounds remain serene.",Feb 2009,August 2008,Traveled as a couple,,Miami Beach
24289188,40,Four Seasons Service but will Not Return,"My family of five (12, 14, 16 year old children) stayed for a week. I had heard so many incredible things about this resort and had very high expectations. The $1000/night tab was a given....however, I was disappointed in the end.  We have been to many of the top Hawaiian Resorts in the past 8 years (Hyatt Kauai, Sheraton Moana, Kealani in Wailea, Mauna Lani Resort to name a few) and I expected this to surpass all of them with flying colors. The service did exceed them. The resort did not. Probably the biggest disappointment was the layout of the hotel in relation to the pools and beach. The Hualalai is splashed along a large meandering beach front. Only the highest priced facilities (suites, etc.) are oceanfront. The rest of the rooms face the golf course or are in the center of the property. The pools are plentiful yet underwhelming. The much ballyhooed ""saltwater"" snorkel lagoon is unique yet unexciting. The beach itself is gorgeous, however, not many venture out into its waters.  If you are are a couple seeking romance and quiet, this is the ultimate Hawaiian destination. The service is unsurpassed. If you are a family looking for some excitement to go with your pampered service, there are better (and substantially less expensive) Hawaiian resort options.",Feb 2009,July 2008,Traveled with family,,"Pasadena, California"
23738386,50,Excellent Experience,My wife and I just came back from a glorious stay at Hualalai. The Hotel was about 60% full so as a result the service was incredible.    The amenities and service make this hotel different from the others on the Big Island    The restaurants were fair but after a long day out and about they provided a good respit. I would highly recommend Hualalai for a romantic getaway or any other time. I think the Hilton at Waikaloa is a better fit for families however.    Whales and turtles were plentiful and the weather was perfect.    We will be back to Hualalai and Kona very soon.,Jan 2009,January 2009,Traveled as a couple,,"Orange County, CA"
23414502,40,Good Trip,"The hotel has a beautiful setting on a huge property. The lobby is set nicely above the rest of the resort with great views (similar to Four Seasons Chiang Mai). Welcome staff (front door/valet and front desk were friendly).    Rooms are very nicely appointed and loved the outdoor shower. Al the amenities that one could ask for are there. We also loved the fact that there are several pools to choose from especially the adult only and would return when we have children as the hotel seems focused on the little guests.    Even though the hotel is on a public beach (All Hawaii Resorts are) you felt like it was private with very few people walking through the resort. There were several turtles resting on the beach during our stay.    Service was good (efficient) but missing a little bit of the ""Aloha Spirit"" - somewhat on the cold side. It seemed like most of the staff (at least at the front of the house were from the mainland). Lunch by the pool was terrific, breakfast and dinner at Pahui'a was very good however a little disappointed with Alan Wong's.... it was good but not great. Housekeeping was terrific, room service (dinner) was disappointing.    I will say that all of the golf staff were fantastic.... girls at the desk to the valets and the cart guy (GREAT). Golf course was in superb condition and so much fun playing on a course cut through the lave flow - brilliant!    Definitely a lot better than other Hawaii hotels but not better than other Four Seasons that we have stayed at.",Jan 2009,November 2008,Traveled as a couple,,"West Palm Beach, Florida"
23122553,30,Beatiful property but service and conformist decor were a bit of a let down,"So I must say, I went there with extremely high expectations, but at that price in that location, I don't see how you can go in with anything but high expectations.    Anyway, the property was beautiful - the pools, the beach, the restaurants. The decor in the room was impeccable, but very conformist; I could have been in DC or in London or anywhere else in the world, so that was a bit surprising. I expected ""you're in Hawaii"" type of decor, not cheesy or touristy, but tropical, and it just wasn't. I could have pulled my laptop, and pretended I was in my office. But again, lovely room with great bathroom, so maybe it's just me.    Service, with the exception of the spa, was a big disappointment as was the ""pride and joy"" restaurant"". We were only there for a couple of nights for a romantic getaway, and have made it explicitly clear that we would like to be in a quiet area. The hotel specifically states that they try to group families and couples into separate areas, and when I spoke with them before we arrived and once we arrived they assured me that we will be there. Well, we were put in the same house as a family with several really LOUD teenagers. We then went for a romantic dinner at Pahu i`a, which my boyfriend made reservations for and asked to be seated in a quiet spot, if possible. We were seated right next to a family with two small children when there were other tables available! I have asked to be reseated but they said that other tables were reserved (only a few people showed up by the end of our dinner). We are both pretty easy going, and wanted to focus on the positive, so we just ordered dinner, which was just OK. Again, OK is not what I expect from Four Seasons.    I could go on and on - we've had problems with canceling a spa reservation, which was well within their cancellation policy, more dealings with unhelpful employees, etc.    So to sum it all up - it was just OK, beautiful scenery spoiled by sub-par service. For that price, I would highly recommend going elsewhere. Fairmont was lovely, for example as was the bed and breakfast we stayed in that was half the price and twice the service (Holualoa Inn).",Dec 2008,August 2007,Traveled as a couple,,

While we've been to quite a few Four Seasons around the world (the one in Langkawi, Malaysia is SPECTACULAR), this hotel was just only average. The grounds are nice, and so is reception. The rooms are nothing to write home about, and are in urgent need of an upgrade as they are dated. The restaurants are ridiculously overpriced, especially the Pool restaurant. I've never paid so much for so little. If you pay Four Seasons prices, you expect a Four Seasons experience, unfortunately this was not the case.

If you are expecting to be close to the ocean with their ""Prime"" ocean view, think again. That would be the ocean front room.

21920422,10,Your Child Will Cry at Hualalai,"Upon arrival, I requested late checkout so we could have a birthday party for our child in our party. I was told to do this on the day of checkout. On the day of checkout, I was told that we should have requested late checkout on the day of arrival and that it was impossible for us to stay even 1/2 hour beyond the noon checkout time (even though check in was 3:00 p.m.). This was untrue of course but the hotel staff didn't want to raise a finger to ask the cleaning staff to clean our room a bit later. We tried to arrange to have the previously ordered birthday cake brought to the lobby to have the party there since we were booted from the room--but catering insisted they could not get the cake ready in time. The child had looked forward to swimming on her birthday but due to being booted from the room could not. She was bawling. She had been waiting for her mom and me to return from our OFF SITE accommodations, because the hotel refused to let our family of five all stay in our suite, though we were paying thousands a day, even though it had a rollaway bed, couch, and double bed and could easily have accommodated all of us--they wanted to force us to buy a second room. Instead we stayed at the lovely Mango Sunset B&B which had great food and was a wonderful experience. We commuted to the rest of the family at the Hualalai. I also had to hassle to get ""permission' for the child to feed the stingray which was the whole point of staying there. There is an advance sign up but because our family was split up by this hotel's policies we couldn't bring the child to the sign up early in the morning (we were forced off site, remember) and so I had to lobby through a bunch of resistant staff so the child could feed the ray the day before her birthday. That was a barrel of fun. The attitude of this hotel is that they have their rules and the customer doesn't matter--they are going to enforce their rules. Those who like this place are not among those who have had to ask for a small concession which would cost the hotel nothing (which concession will not be granted) and are not looking for a good value. Absolutely a rotten experience. Incidentally, upon leaving the nasty Hualalai, we went to the Hilton Waikoloa Village. I was a little apprehensive about this property because the Hilton Hawaiian Village at Oahu is overrun with tourists, Waikoloa Village was another story--well-designed, not overcrowded, and extremely accommodating. They even made a last minute birthday cake for the child which the Hualalai made cry. AND, Waikoloa Village has a wonderful Dolphin Experience. This bad Hualalai experience really reflects on the Four Seasons, because my view prior to this was that if you pay the big premium with Four Seasons, your expectation is perfect service.

I was at the hotel in October when there was a very low occupancy rate, and the rooms were consistently not made up until late afternoon or early evening. Upon check in, they also immediately showed you photos to try to get you to pay extra to upgrade your room - I thought I was at a timeshare rather than a top rated hotel and this is from a place where the normal rooms are $700 per night. The dinner on Saturday night that's under the stars is wonderful and the staff at the golf course is fantastic. However, given the above, the overall service falls short of expectations for this quality of hotel and you do feel as though they try to get your last nickel.

21546487,50,Hawaii As You Dreamt of It,"My wife and I have stayed at the Four Seasons Hualalai twice now and are continuously wowed at the service, facilities and food. Once you stay here, you will have a hard time finding an equal or better hotel given the low rise bungalow layout, and world class amenities.    Most people who stay here do not rent a car and this is something that you will understand when you arrive. Otherwise I would agree with all of the superlatives written on this board, they frankly do not do the place justice. One thing I have not seen on TA is a discussion of the five cresents of Hualalai. Included below are a few observations which you might find helpful.    King's Pond - Quite, good ocean views, not as much greenery. They will be building a mega 5 bedroom suite at the northern most tip of the cresent.    Sea Shell - Best for families that like the sea shell pool. Very green with thatched huts making it feel the most Hawaiian.    Beach Tree - Most central to the all parts of the resort, including Main House, Beach Tree Grill and of course . Tends to be adult couples who come regularly to Hualalai (and there are many who do).    Palm Grove - I agree entirely with your call on this and feel it is the most private for honeymooners and they like. The area is very green which while beautiful can reduce the uninterupted vistas of the ocean that one might get on the King's Pond.    Golf-Ocean - Set further back from the ocean behind the 18th hole, but still with an ocean view. Nearest the golf pro shop and Alan Wong's Hualalai Grill.

21171158,50,One of the most fantastically beautifull and friendly places in the world!,"Ok you can judge by the title,that I don't agree with the previous two posters.  We arrived late in the evening to an oasis lit up in the dark by glowing fire flame lamps.The resort is huge with a large network of trails,driveways and walkways that it takes a day or two to get to know.Our check in was excelent and we were taken by one of the staff for a long tour en route to our room in one of the buggy's.    We were given an ocean front room which was one half of the presidential suite as an upgrade.The room was beautifull and had a balcony that hung over the beach maybe 5 yards from the water.  With the doors of the balcony open at night,you could fall asleep in your bed to the sound of the pacific.    We soon found a daily routine of swimming in one of the safe swim areas,the main out door pool and then taking our hire car off for the day somewhere.We drove around the whole of the big island during our stay.On some of the days we'd just laze around in a cabana on the beach and then head back to that georgeous room,shower and get ready for dinner.  We'd always start dinner with a few beers at the beach bar-TOTAL BLISS!  We ate at pahul'a [now closed temporarally I believe as art of the renovation] and at Alan Wongs.  the service at both was outstanding and despite the hotel only being half occupied at the time,both restaurants were very busy! That tells it's own tale as the food and service in both were top notch.  Breakfast each day was at pahul'a and was outstanding.  Their omlettes were cooked in front of your eyes and were delicious.

20854339,20,Not worth it,"It is interesting how there is a complete dichotomy of reviews for this hotel. Some people think it’s incredible and would not change a thing and others had terrible experiences. Our experience was near the middle but based upon the price, I’d rank the hotel on the terrible side.  We relied heavily on the reviews to make a decision to stay at this hotel and were extremely disappointed.  We stayed at the hotel during the last week of August 2008. We expressed our concerns about hotel construction upon booking directly with the hotel, about a week before our intended arrival. The hotel assured us we would not be placed in any room adjacent to construction so we were delighted to check in and open the door to our room and hear the jack hammer of the construction workers ripping apart the patio of the room immediately adjacent to ours. We wasted an entire day going back and forth to the reception desk to ask when another room would be ready, and move again at 4pm.  The next day housekeeping did not come during the day or evening so every day I had to call to request housekeeping to attend to the room.  We spent most of our time at the Beach Tree pool. It was irritating that the hotel let guests reserve their chairs for 2 hours a day to go to lunch so if you did not get to the pool early, you did not get a chair. The hotel was not at all busy but all the chairs were reserved early so I cannot imagine what would happen if the hotel were at capacity. The umbrellas are old and worn and did not block the sun and we got sunburn while sitting with the umbrella up all day. We met two other guests at the Manager’s cocktail reception and they mentioned the integrity of the umbrellas, having got sunburn as well.  The pool staff were slow and miserable and they would not clean up the towels when the chairs vacated nor take away any trash so you had to self-serve.  We tried the Grille by Alan Wong and had the daily fish special which was dry and flavorless and expensive. We had a nice dinner at Pahu I’a; the food and service was fine. The best quality of food for the price was at the coffee stand at the golf course and the resident’s beach restaurant.  The conclusion for the hotel is that they have different levels of service depending on the guest and if you start to complain early and make demands, you get service. The rest of the guests are ignored. We would not be back based upon our evaluation of quality for the price. We compared this hotel to the Kanuhura resort in the Maldives (formerly One&Only resorts) which we stayed at in Nov. 2007. The views were more amazing, the food was incredible and it is all flown in daily from UAE and we stayed in a bungalow over the ocean for $925/night.",Oct 2008,August 2008,Traveled as a couple,,"MA, USA"

We had reservations for around 9pm.  We checked in and literally waited approx. 15 minutes to be seated. The hostess seemed lost, checking her book, then checking the seating area then repeating this at least 3 addiitional times.  I looked around the bend into the dining area to see the restaraunt about 90% empty-I asked if there was a problem then waited some more.  A second hostess then asked if were being helped and then she started the checking routine.  Finally seated it took about 15- 20 minutes to get menus and drinks.  The balance of the meal was average at best and bad if you judge it against price. I was reluctant to write this negative reiew knowing anyone can have an off night. However the absolute lack of service without any acknowldgement needed to be noted.  As a side note we thought the valet staff was also a tad snooty.

19728191,40,"Week Long stay: mixed feelings, second time staying","We really should be making two posts: 1. we were going to have our wedding here at the FS Hualalai and we were planning a destination wedding so we have a lot of positive and many negative comments to make.    This post however will cover my stay from August 20-26. I was forced to absorb the costs of rooms as a result of my fiancee and my decision to postpone the wedding - the FS Hualalai is extremely insensitive when it comes to refunding for cancelled rooms. They claim a difficult time to sell the rooms, yet during my stay the hotel was at near 100% occupancy.    Pros: Hotel is beautiful, very well maintained, nice quiet pool, nice cabanas, fun lagoons with the King's pond. Service is good around the pool    Cons: Food was very overpriced, could not get a sandwich for under $30 bucks. Found service at the reception and room bookings to be very difficult.    I loved the golf course - we played a few rounds, if you book a tee time, you can play as many rounds on that day as you want. fees are not cheap at $250/person. we also played the waikoloa courses which were hassle free and enjoyable and very reasonably priced.    If you are looking to plan a banquet, you want to contact CINDY TAVARES, by far the most competent, service oriented and diligent member of the FS Hualalai staff. Ilse Harley is the resort manager and also quite responsive to customers' issues.    We had a private banquet on the beach one of our nights and we found the hired chef and grill to be fantastic, all of our guests enjoyed it. Be careful about ordering specialty drinks as those are double regular cocktail drinks.    DO NOT participate in the deep sea fishing organized by the concierge. my bros and i did this, wasted $700 and 4 hrs of our time. worst event of our trip.    Rooms are good - we had an ocean view room, were in suite 2912, good views of the ocean. started off near the pool, which i liked as you could walk to the quiet pool.    We saw Julia Roberts and Hilary Swank at the resort, so hollywood types to frequent the resort.    Youre paying about $1000 a night when it's all said and done for the room, so if you go, dont plan too many events beyond staying at the resort.    Timing- weve been in feb 07 and aug 08, and we found feb 07 to be much much much less crowded. a lot of times we had to secure pool deck chairs around 9am otherwise they would all be gone by 10/11 am (august 08).    my biggest issue with the FS Hualalai is that they fight for every penny, they find a way to charge the customer for every possible cost, and it takes away from the stay. i have no problem paying for pleasure and 5 star service, but the FS hualalai makes you feel you need to examine every bill and that they care more about taking your money than helping a customer relax and enjoy the vaca.",Sep 2008,August 2008,,,Hong Kong
19434744,40,Overrated for honeymoon,"We had heard that this was the most amazing hotel in Hawaii. We got married at the Fairmont then went to the Four Seasons for our Honeymoon. Since it was our honeymoon we splurged and paid 880 usd for an oceanfront room. The room was by far the biggest disappointment. It seemed pretty small and dark and really overlooked a pool. Looking back the room was the biggest disappointment and we still talk about it two years later especially given the price.  The service at the hotel was top quality, the pools were nice. The food and drinks were good but pricey as expected. The grounds are amazing and the hotel itself is very beautiful.  We were just letdown with the room. If we went back again we would stay at the Fairmont.",Aug 2008,August 2006,Traveled as a couple,,Atlanta
19096106,50,"What's the big deal, really?","That was my web-researched assessment of FSH before – by chance – I visited one afternoon on my June trip. As soon as I walked into the lobby, my jaws dropped at how beautiful, serene, & harmonious it felt. The lobby is opened to all sides. Every direction you look the eyes see something extremely pleasing. It’s hard to describe the feeling that comes through you when you come across perfection in design. Did the designers get lucky, or were they THAT good? Who cares. Two weeks after returning home, I booked a trip back to the island for mid Aug.    This was a scouting trip consisting of just 3 of us. Next summer I’m bringing my whole gang.    CHECK-IN:  Less than 5 minutes. Maybe 3.  When you drive up to the guard house @ the resort’s entrance, he will ask for your name. If you had booked multiple rooms, do give him all the names. By the time you reach the valet station, everybody are already waiting for you: the valet will tag all your luggage w/ pre-labeled name tags so they know which bags go to which rooms; at the same time, a receptionist is already waiting for you w/ cool towels, cold juices, and all your paper works all pre-done so you simply have to sign in a few places & everybody are immediately whisked to their rooms.    SPECIAL REQUESTS:  Well before your arrival date, the concierge will contact you to see what/anything you needed.  I wanted the mini-bar in each room stocked w/ 10 bottles of Waiwera sparkling water. Waiwera is available through only 1 Hawaiian distributor in a 24-pack format for $160. I expected the resort to add a hefty profit on top of that $160. It added $0. The water arrived in the mini-bar pre-chilled, exactly as I requested. Also, I noticed that it was actually not 1 but rather several concierges that took care of my requests, which one would think could easily cause mix-up/mess-up. But, no, they never dropped the ball. Well executed.    THE ROOMS:  The room with king bed is definitely much better than the one w/ 2 double beds. It’s aesthetically more pleasing & feels more spacious. You also get a sofa w/ ottoman + 2 chairs, whereas in the double beds room you get 3 chairs.    The downstairs room has the outdoor shower, but pretty much garden/partial-ocean view. Personally, I prefer this, because I already see the ocean the whole day. On the other hands, w/ the upstairs room you can watch the dolphins jumping, spinning, playing from your balcony while having breakfast. But you can also see the dolphins from Pahu I’a. You can see them almost every day. Some days very close to shore.    The walk-in closet is very spacious. No need to fight over who gets which parts.    No need to bring your iPod/iPhone charger. Just dock it into the room’s iHome system.    There are 2 wastebaskets. One is marked “recyclables”. Loved that.    DEALS/DISCOUNTS:  I had read in a recent review/forum that FSH must be getting a little desperate, because it was now offering the unheard deal of stay 4 pay 3. I would say it’s not at all desperate. That deal is available starting in late Aug, when many facilities will be closed/inconvenienced (the adult pool & the Beach Tree restaurant will be closed, the spa will be relocated to a temp location, some entire bungalow crescents will be unavailable, etc).    Also, the week I was there, the resort was 100% full. I checked for available rooms on-line few days before arriving. No rooms.    RENOVATIONS:  Renovations are supposed to be completed I believe in Aug 2009. Here are the exact details:  http://www.fourseasons.com/hualalai/enhancements/enhancement_map/    ALAN WONG’S HUALALAI GRILLE:  While we liked Alan Wong’s in Honolulu for its warm & casual Hawaiian feel, we loved the Grille. The restaurant is very beautifully designed, perfectly dimmed, & had just enough white noise. The food was very good. Everything was on-par. The tomato salad looked like it couldn’t be all that good (an orangish colored sauce covered the plate bottom, topped with a large tomato, that’s it!), but it was delicious. Of course, one must have the classic soup & sandwich (tomato soup served in martini glass, with a foie gras/kalua pork grilled cheese sandwich). The sandwich sounds oily, but the tomato soup cleans up everything.    Much has been debated in the forum about dressing up/down. You will not feel overdressed if you dress up to the hilt & jewel up. If you dress down, no one will blink; but I guarantee if something came out of the kitchen overcooked/unsatisfactory, they will not comp you properly. My sister & I dressed properly, while my guy friend wore a t-shirt (!). His roast beef was delicious but overcooked. They made him another one which was perfect. But all he got was a free drink. Well, it was his t-shirt & his beef!    PAHU I’A:  We didn’t have dinner here. But I certainly vote for Canoe House @ Mauna Lani as being more beautiful & romantic. Hands down.    MANAGER’S RECEPTION:  You will get an invitation. Do try to go. It’s nice & interesting to talk to the employees. And, yes, the bite-sized appetizers they serve are very very good.    NO SHOW OFFS:  I did not see one single luxury logo item, which was a surprise. Personally, I hate logos (I sold my Mercedes because I got too many comments about it).    Most guests & residents were very low key. Polite, nice, well dressed but unflashy. Perhaps some a bit stuffy but who cares. Children were all well-behaved.    THE POOLS/BEACHES:  I told my guy friend ""Thu is mandatory water day, all day"". His reply: ""you do know how much I don't like water"". OK, yes, whatever. As it turned out, he said the pools were his favorite thing about the resort. He loved them.    And each pool has different temperature. For example, the kids pool was quite warm - for the small children who may be temp sensitive.    The swimming beach was really great. Low tide was ~9am while we were there, so the water was very calm & we usually saw ~ 10 turtles in there every morning.    If you want soft postcard white sand beaches, there's Kukio just south of the resort (you can walk there via the golf course). And Kua Bay just south of that (you have to drive there, probably 5 minutes from the resort). I meant to visit these beaches, but didn't get a chance. Next trip.    EXCURSION RECOMMS:  - ATV adventure: www.ridetherim.com is recommended by FSH. It’s a relatively new company & not yet widely known. We were all very happy with it. A bit of a drive up north, but worth it.  - Kona coffee/macadamia nut farm tour: www.kuaiwifarm.com is an organic farm owned by Una & Leon. Both are very personable & lovely. Their coffee is award winning. They won 1st place the very 1st time they entered. This is not a high output farm, it small scale & very casual. We will revisit them.  - Snorkel with dolphin: much controversy about this one. I did this back in June & loved it. But then as I read more & more about it, for me personally, I will not do the tour ever again. You just don’t know when the dolphins will want to rest & be left alone, and when they want humans around.    TRANSPORTATION RECOMMS:  - We absolutely the Buick Enclave CXL suv with leather. Last time we got the Explorer with leather, which we loved. But the Buick is the way to go. Hertz.  - United is your only commercial choice from San Francisco. I would not ever fly United first class domestically. It’s sardine seating @ premium price. The seat pitch is less than 40” – extremely shocking. We always fly Hawaiian Airlines first class, which is very worth it for the price; but it doesn’t fly N/S into KOA.    All in all, was it PERFECT? Of course not. But quality of service & everything else is extremely high, thus their high return guests rate.",Aug 2008,August 2008,Traveled with friends,,"Vancouver, Canada"
19091136,50,Heaven,"There is a reason why this property has been voted over and over the best in the world. I found this place to be PERFECT. It has the outstanding service that the FS is known for, two top restaurants in the premises (hualalai grill & pauhia) but the star of the show is the actual property. Countless acres of ocean front, lava pools, turtles resting on the sand, meandering paths beneath giant trees. Really, I just can not think of a way that this place could be better, oh and the gym is the absolute best and most well equipped I have seen in a hotel property..of course I didn't get to use it.",Aug 2008,July 2008,Traveled with family,,"Miami, Florida"
18926325,50,"Was perfect last time, again this time, and can't wait for the next time!","This is my 2nd time to the Four Seasons, and it is my favorite so far of the Four Seasons. Much more calm, quite, and less stuffy than the one on Maui. Unbelievable service. Despite going in August, it was never hard to get a chair in the sun, shade or a cabana on the beach or by the pool. Staff will save your chair for lunch. There are 4 pools, each with their own charm. The adult pool is so peaceful. The kids pool is fun and not even super loud or chaotic. There's a kid's pool with sand that I didn't use, and last is the King's Pond that has over 2000 fish and large rays to snorkle in. The ocean was mellow for the kids, and it wasn't hard to swim with a sea turtle as they always seemed to be playing in the cove everyday. The drinks are pricey, but I guess expected. The grounds are immaculate. There is a kids club with video games and the Wi. I had high expectations of this place after staying here before and loving it, but they didn't let me down!    The only good shopping on the island are the King and Queen shops. The best, softest sand beach is Hapuna or Mauna Kea Beach. Not a far drive from Hualalai!",Aug 2008,August 2008,,,San Jose
18293254,50,Heaven on Earth.,"My husband and I had a terrific time at the Four Seasons Hualalai on the Big Island. The villa style hotel made it seem like there were fewer people at the resort than there probably were. We had very limited interaction with other guests, and that was kind of the way we liked it.    The resort itself is so remote that it was a long and winding drive to get to once you make the turn off of route 19, but the drive is interesting because you will pass huge stretches of lava rock and the beautiful golf course.    We had an ocean view second floor room (Room 2810 right by the 18th hole, so we lacked the open air shower, but I didn't think we were going to use that anyway, so it wasn't a big loss). When we were checking in, we were greeted with leis, pineapple orange and guava juice and an oshiburi towel to freshen up. The front desk clerk met us outside, right by the valet, so we never had to walk into the lobby building; once we were done checking in, we walked straight from the driveway to our room.    The quiet pool was one of the nicest pools I have ever been to in my life. It has a beautiful view of the ocean, and while we were there, there were so many open cabanas that we never felt like we had to wake up early to secure one (they are on a first come, first serve basis). The beach is also beautiful - sea turtles rest in one special spot by the restaurant Pahui'a everyday (but don't disturb them or touch them - it is illegal!)    The restaurants are also delicious. Alan Wong's was a delightful experience. I tried the tasting menu and I was not disappointed. Pahui'a was also wonderful. It has a four diamond rating from the AAA, and it was way to fancy a meal for breakfast. Try the lemon ricotta pancakes - beautiful, thin, and delicious!!!    The staff was friendly here as well. Everyone was very chatty and extremely helpful. A couple of concierge staff members went out of their way to help us. One was Gilles from Brittany and the other was Kathryn Castleberry. They were wonderful!    We would return here in a heartbeat if we can afford it a second time!",Jul 2008,July 2008,Traveled as a couple,,"Montclair, New Jersey"
18277941,50,They take care of the little (and not so little) things.,"The Kona Four Seasons is the Four Season's flagship resort for a reason. I have been to some nice places all over the world, and I have to say that the Kona Four Seasons is head and shoulders above anywhere that I have stayed before. It is an awesome destination. We went to a wedding there and almost didn't stay at the resort, but my several of my fiance's coworkers said that we had to because it was the nicest place that they had ever been. We were not disappointed. The grounds and rooms were impeccable, only outdone by the service. The two things that I enjoyed the most about this place was that no one is a second class citizen. Every guest is a VIP, and there is no segregation (I played basketball with Jim Belushi). All the rooms are full on ocean front. (About the rooms, I would try to get one downstairs. They are arranged with two levels, upstairs and downstairs, obviously. The 2 reasons I would prefer the downstairs, which is where our room was, are that the downstairs have an magical outdoor shower, and you can walk right out of your room to the pool. I don't think that the upper rooms had the shower, but I can't be certain.)    The pools are amazing. One of the pools is for snorkeling. It actually has fish and rays and other ocean creatures. We really liked the pool that we were in front of. It wasn't the quiet pool or the family pool, but the other one. It was beautiful. One note about this is get out there kinda early to stake out a prime seat. (We never had a problem, but this was advice that I got. I don't think that anyone has problems there.)    Another thing that I loved was that the resort doesn't nickel and dime you. (I mean it is all priced in to that bill at the end, which *will* be substantial.) If you want a water, they are there for consumption. You don't have to feel bad wondering if you should pay for a $5 water, because it is free. It's not just the water, and I'm not trying to sound cheap, the resort thinks of everything. If there is something that you might think that you need, you turn and there it is. My fiance commented that the resort makes it so you don't have to think or worry. They take care of those processes for you. I thought that this brought us to another level of relaxation.    The resort has tons of activities, so there is no need to leave. We didn't. I am ususally one who can't sit around too long, and was dubious when a friend told me that there is no reason to leave the resort, and that I wouldn't want to. (I walked 45 minutes to get off a resort in Puerto Rico years ago.) It is true though. The only reason that you might want to leave is to see the volcano. I really wanted to do this, but it is a bit of a drive and then like a 1 hour to 2 hour hike. As far as I could ascertain, there was not much around the hotel, but I believe that there is a town not too far away.    One last tip. I know nothing of your means, but I would point out, as a friend told me, that there is a semi-hidden cantina. At the cantina, which is just past the spa, you can buy food, wine and beer at a pretty significant discount to anywhere else on the resort. I thought that this was a pretty good FYI.    Oh, and I just mentioned the spa. I am sure that you will use it, and it *is* amazing, but the facilities are open to all guests.    I can't gush enough about how much we enjoyed it, and that is what is making this email so long. I am happy just remembering it.

The hotel's property is unreal and the rooms are some of the nicest I have seen in the world. The service is first class and I cant say enough about how the guests are treated.

We were invited to a manager's reception, and met two people who work for housekeeping.

17264192,50,I kept on thinking that it just doesn't get much better than this!,"WOW.....!!! I was lucky enough to be invited on another trip to this property. I was here about 11 years ago when it first opened, and I loved it then, but it continues to get better! It was fun to see how it has grown....    The hotel is an easy drive from the airport. I would say about 20 min. or so. You arrive and enter the lobby which is gorgeous and has a breathtaking view! Of course you get a lei, and a fruity drink. The drink coulda used rum--ha!    We had an amazing ocean view room. It was over the small quiet adult pool. 2nd floor, better view. Although I heard the outdoor showers are amazing on the first floor, I liked my view. There was no one ever even at the little pool, so if you want privacy, this is the place to be.    This is a big resort, but you feel as if it is very small and very private.    COMFY beds. HUGE flat screen TV--not that you need a TV here. Big bathroom, separate bath and shower. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the L'Occataine toiletries. Except the conditioner is watered down, so ladies take your own :) The only bad part is poor makeup lighting, and I didn't really care--but it was hard to get eyeliner on! Lots of towels and both cotton and terrycloth robes. The balcony deck was perfect for sitting and watching the sunset, or just watching the waves! I just wish that they delivered the NY Times fax or some type of news to your room in the morning so you can read out there early. Love the beach tote in the room available to use during your stay. Made my life alot easier!    I prefer the adult beach tree pool. I hear they are renovating it? It was a nice quiet pool, but I wish they would enforce the ""no kids"" rule a little stricter. I am one of those who is allergic to kids. ANd some nutty woman was swimming laps comeplete with goggles, swimcap, and big ol' kick for a LONG time. Hello, there is a GREAT lap pool. Not sure she knoew that. Deck chairs were nice, but they should consider some double chaise lounges for real luxury. Only 1 day was I put on a silly ""waiting list"" (although there were empty chairs) for a deck chair--the pool gals really like to be able to enforce that waiting list. The spa was nice and hot, too. They had current magazines, and books. Passed fresh pineapple skewers--yum! One day they came around with little coconut/mango smoothies--THE BEST! Evian spritzers, skin soothing aloe vera cups, otter pops--you name it, they had it. Even leave-in conditioner you can spray on. Very nice touch. I could have sat out there for the rest of my life (with SPF 80 of course!!). I think they would have brought me almost anything I asked for. They don't seem to know the word ""no.""    The food at the pool was wonderful. I had a daily fish wrap because it was sooooo delicious! And the lobster salad was to die for as well. Vast drinks selection (POM mojitos made w/ Splenda!), Crazy expensive, but you are at the Four Seasons in Hawaii, right? Beach Tree Bar was the ideal place to chat it up and get a cocktail. Bartenders are super friendly--but are forced to wear really small goofy shirts (ask them--ha!).    Breakfast restaurant was great. Service was always very pleasant. Just very expensive--but duh. Views made me pinch myself every day!    Saturday night sea food buffet was not to be missed! For $85 you had all the sushi, lobster, clams, steak, ETC you can imagine. Makes my mouth water thinking about it!    I did not do the spa, but the gym could not have been better! It was beautiful. Lots of current new cardio machines, most with TV's on them. Great classes, lap pool, nice selection of weight machines. Tennis facility looked like a blast. Made me want to work out! They make sure you always have a full water, and keep the place very clean.    I also did the 5.3 mile jogging trail. It is a good workout, but you are also walking on lots of asphalt. It definately got the job done though. And you don't have to go that far--there are other options.    The Sea Shell pool was perfect for those with kids. Seemed pretty happening--with splashy loud children. Perfect for them. The Kings Pond pool kinda creeped me out, but I am sure some like it. All of the black around it absorbed heat and it was just hot to look at it. Can't imagine lounging at it. Not my thing. If the quiet adult pool was being renovated I might not be very happy with the other options.    The beach was a pleasant place to lounge as well, but there is no swimming--which was fine for me. But others were not happy about it.    Lava Lounge was empty every night--but the hotel was at capacity. That is OK. Better than too crowded!    We were at a group function, so we had a few group dinners. Steak, lobster--you name it. They did a wonderful job! The staff was always very accomodating. Sometimes group dinners can be ""rubber chicken"" functions, but these were not. It could not have been better. Staff was ""ON IT!!""    Funny, we joked about how we were excited to go back to CA so we did not have to say hi to anyone anymore--EVERYONE gives you an aloha here--EVERYONE. Service was the best I have ever experienced. Just could not have been better!    The group coordinator told me that the only complaint he had the whole trip was that a kid complained the pull out sofa bed was not comfy--but hello, it is a sofa bed. Usually not comfy!

17165248,50,Fab Four Seasons!,"Yes, this resort really is great. Fabulous setting and the usual awesome Four Seasons' staff. High end dining at several restaurants and fun fare around the pool. We just had seven nights in mid-June and really wished it could have been more. It is expensive, but worth it and no silly daily resort fee or charge for cabanas -- they could do away with the $15 per night valet parking fee though. With a 13 year-old boy with us we really appreciated the kids' and teen menus. Good golf, though the Mauna Lani just up the coast is a better course. Loved the choice of pools and snorkeling in the King's Pond was great fun. The Hualalai resort is world class. What would make it perfect? The beach is not your classic wide sandy expanse with body surfing opportunities, but a couple of sandy coves with lava reef. (If the beach were more inviting it would probably attract crowds, so perhaps it's better as is.) The exteriors of the room buildings are underwhelming. Could they be made more ""island-like""? Perhaps some faux-thatch? There is a surf shack, but scuba is not offered on site. Could it be? Yes, but Kona Village (just a fairly short walk away along the beach) has a full service ocean adventures facility with dive boat. The Kona dive staff were absolutely terrific and our son took his first beach and boat dive with them. The dive sites are not that spectacular but still very enjoyable.

16804705,50,what more could you want.,I stayed for 3 nights the first week of June.  From the minute you arrive until you leave you are pampered and feel so relaxed at this property. All the rooms have views and there are 5 pools to choose from besides the beach. I had a room at Kings Pond and it was very peaceful. They light the torches at night and leave them on all night so you can listen to the ocean and see the lights. Its very romantic. The rooms are very nice and have lots of room. There are free laundry facilities throughout the property.  The breakfast is great and you can do buffet or ala carte. I ate at Pahuia and the Beach Tree Grill (italian). Both were excellent. They also have a program where you can order food to take with you on the plane and you pick it up when you check out.  Free internet and DVD's in the business center.  The staff is great and will do anything for you. Go to kings pond and feed/swim with the fish/rays.

16792249,50,Where service goes when it dies!,"I mean heaven! I'm ashamed its taken me so long to write this review, but I've been meaning to for ages. I consiser myself reasonably well traveled, having been to many of the world's best hotels for both work and pleasure, and both my fiancee and myself agree this is the best hotel we've stayed in. I think its the fact that there are just so many great things about it - its the all round experience that just adds up. The service is second to none. I'm an avid Liverpool fan and happened to be there when the champions league semi final vs chelsea was on a couple of years back. I asked at reception whether they were showing the match and they said unfortunately not. However, the lady (I wish I could remember her name to thank her personally!) said that her husband owned a bar nearby and she was sure that he would be ok to open early especially for me so I could watch it live! Not only that, but when I said that 'unfortunately' I was playing golf at the same time as the match, she offered to ask her husband to record it. When I got back to my room after my round, the video player was connected to the TV with the tape ready to roll. How cool is that?! The food is also exceptionally good, especially at The Hualalai Grille (by famous chef Alan Wong) and the pampering around the pool in the daytime is a very nice touch, including a man that comes around to clean your sunglasses whilst offering cold flanels and cucumber slices for your eyes! Last but not least the golf course is a must - probably one of the best I've played on and very challenging to be playing inbetween all the old lava flows. I do hope it hasn't changed too much over these past 2 years and will definitely be returning again one day.",Jun 2008,May 2006,Traveled on business,,England
16676727,50,I want to live here!,"I had read so many good reviews of this hotel that I halfway hoped it was overly hyped and not that great. I didn’t want to get hooked on such an expensive place. I’m hooked, though! I wish I could live there. We had a first floor suite with an outdoor shower overlooking King’s Pond. It’s very quiet there, and I never heard another soul. We were celebrating our anniversary, and the manager sent a bottle of champagne to enjoy at our convenience. We enjoyed it on the beach with a bucket of ice and flutes provided by The Beach Tree bar & grill. Many have commented that the beach isn’t that great, but I disagree. There were huge turtles swimming and resting there every day. We swam with a few and found they were very curious about us. There were plenty of chairs and amenities offered on the beach, too, just like at the pools. It’s definitely not a white sand Florida-style beach, but it is very Hawaiian with lots of tidal pools and lava formations. There is really only one section we could find for calm ocean swimming near The Beach Tree. I couldn’t find anything about the hotel that I didn’t like aside from the cost of a martini ($18). At breakfast they served the most delicious malasadas I have ever eaten in my life. I wish we had more time to experience all the restaurants, but at least I have something to look forward to.    I had read a comparison of hotels on the message boards and saw some people were trying to decide between the Mauna Lani and the Four Seasons, both top ranked. We stayed at both on this trip (see my other review). There is nothing wrong with the Mauna Lani except that it isn’t the Four Seasons. Given a choice between the two and the money to make it happen, I would choose the Four Seasons. It has no competition now that the Mauna Kea is under construction (slow going according to the staff at the Hau Tree and probably reopening in 2009 rather than this year).    I agree with the other recent reviews that the end of May is a good time to go. I had expected the place to be overrun, but it was totally dead. We had great service and practically had the pools to ourselves all day long. We snorkeled several times in King’s Pond and were totally alone. We got perfect chairs facing the ocean at the amazing horizon pool and sometimes were the only two people in it.    One more comment – the floral and gardening staff here is excellent. We went to a wedding, and the florist sent beautiful (and reasonably priced) leis for us made of tuberose and sea grape in less that 30 minutes when we called from the beach bar.",Jun 2008,May 2008,Traveled as a couple,,"Raleigh, North Carolina"
16537404,50,What took me so long???,"We just got back from a 6 night stay and it was the best Hawaii vacation I've ever had. Like the previous review, May appears to be an excellent time to go - it is betwen Spring break and summer vacation. You could find a cabana at 11:00 AM which is unheard of at other resorts I have stayed.    We rented a car although I could see why you might not and just stay on the property. The grocery store in Waikoloa is 30 minutes away but one trip will fill up your refrigerator and get you some munchies to bring home for family/friends. I got a nice bottle of wine and cheese/crackers and some nights you just don't need to go out for dinner especially if you had a larger, late lunch.    The Residence Beach house is located at the far South side of the property along the walkway and is open to hotel guests for lunch only. There are many private homes adjacent to the property and this restaurant is for them during dinner hours so hotel guests cannot go at that time. It is literally located 3 feet from the beach and the food is very good (would not have gone had it not been for previous reviews) Speaking of these private residences, I asked the pool attendant why I saw so many negative remarks regarding lack of pool facilities during spring break. It turns out that all of these homes have access to Four Seasons amenities and during the spring break and Christmas there are many people vacationing who come down to the hotel and use up all the of lounge chairs so it becomes a battle between them and the hotel guests to find available spots. You might want to keep that in mind if you are coming then since you probably would need to get up early to ""claim"" your spot.    There is free coffee in the lobby with croissants/muffins until about 7:30 and free coffee/newspapers at the restaurant til much later. Oh yes, there is also a complementary tote bag in each room for you to use during your stay. It has a $50 price tag attached if you would like to purchase at the end of your visit but you are free to use during your trip so you don't need to pack one if you don't want. It is made of a natural material similar to palm fronds so is a nice neutral color - you will see people using them all over the property. It is large enough to hold your sunscreen, magazines, munchies, etc.    I literally laid under a thatched hut for 3 days and did nothing but swim and read. One day we went coffee tasting (much like wine tasting) - concierge has a fabulous map and I also did research on internet and with a book I highly recommend ""Hawaii, The Big Island Revealed"" by Andrew Doughty - Wizard Publications. There is a book for each island and tells about all the best of everything from a local resident. We went to Mountain Thunder which is up in a rain forest - amazing coffee - you can purchase at Costco for less than $20/lb in Kona - I wish I had bought more than one! Another day we drove to an orchid farm and purchased a couple to bring home. They were professionally boxed and I checked in as luggage with American Airlines and they arrived home in perfect condition. Of course, this is all before checked luggage will have fees so I got 2 beautiful Cattleya orchids for $25 - no shipping.    I have been to FS Wailea 5 times and since it was so wonderful saw no need to change, but took a chance and it was such a smart decision. If you want to swim/snorkel outside your hotel you would be better off at Wailea, but if the sound of the ocean is good enough and you can make do with 5 fabulous swimming pools - including one with 5,000 fish to snorkel with then you will not regret this property.",May 2008,May 2008,Traveled as a couple,,"Long Beach, CA"
16142326,40,Nice! A boutique hotel feel.,"Amazing experience here. Found it to be a great property. There are approx 35-40 individual bungalows with 4 hotel rooms per bldg - felt like a nice tropical resort as opposed to big box hotel like Maui Four Seasons. This hotel is a quick 15 min cab ride from KONA airport. Very easy access.    The property is spread out over many acres so even if the resort was busy you may not feel it. The adult pool area is great. Our trip this May was very quiet so there was never any difficulty finding pool chairs. The kids/family pool looked great too. The beach here is nice, but the ocean is not for swimming. The currents are pretty rough.    There are several restaurants on the property and during our 5 night stay we didn't leave the property once. We simply didn't feel a need to. The food was very good, albeit quite expensive. Don't miss the brunch buffet.    The Health Spa looked amazing. The Golf course looked amazing. They are getting $250pp for greens fees.    We booked a normal ocean view room. Upon checkin we asked if there were any discounted upgrades avail and there was. We got a $1750 room for $1350 / nt. Considering we were a part of the ""5th night free"" program it wasn't terribly offensive.    We had a one bedroom suite which had 42"" flat screen tv in the living room, and a smaller flat panel in the bedroom. Comfortable bed / linens. Rooms are an 8.5 out of 10. Very adequate, but won't blow you away. Some people talk about this gimmicky indoor/outdoor shower the ground floor units have. Nothing special. Don't think you have to have it when booking.    We were told the property will undergo renovations slowly over the course of the coming year(s). One restaurant closing in SEPT for work to be done. I absolutely plan to go back to this hotel. Especially in May which seems nice and off-season.",May 2008,May 2008,,,"Chicago, Ill."
15735504,50,Continue to love the four seasons,"We stayed under the 4 nights get one free package in late April. Hotel always felt spacious and easy to get a chair by a pool. The quiet pool was wonderful and they bring around a lot of special treats. Played the golf course and they let me play as a single playing two balls which was alot of fun, but at the cost, once was enough. Kids liked complementary kids club and they have on property store to get breakfast and other snacks which helped ease the cost. Although have to have breakfast one day at the main rest. Complementary coffee around in the morning. There real is no beach except for the kids to play on and saturday's b-que was great but 85 per head. lap pool was brilliant and tennis was fun. we did a helicopter ride with blue hawaiian and bob was brilliant, saw new vent and some lava. Did fairwinds 2 tour as well and it was worthwhile. short trip up to hilton for lunch after helicopter , glad we were at 4 seasons. regrets.. should have got taxi to hotel and just rent car from there for the two days. family loved it, get up early to do the walks with lanterns blazing. We like ground floor , stayed in number 11 which had lawn in front and had lava showers.

15688356,50,The place to stay if you can!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"There are not the right words in the english language to describe this oasis. It was both comfortable and elegant. The food there was out of this world. We ate at alan wong's restaurant twice. The tasting menu was reasonably priced for the 5 course menu and wine pairings that go with it ($100). The food was unique and wonderfully prepared.    The concierge and entire staff are beyond helfpful. The service was top notch. It was our honeymoon and we got an upgrade complimentary that gave us a better view of the pool and ocean. The property is large but everything is within minutes of each other.    The rooms are large, we opted for a downstairs room with lava rock shower. It was definitely worth requesting this room. Showering outside was relaxing and serene.    The only down sides to staying here was the price of drinks, almost 14 dollars a drink. The upside was that there was a fridge in the room so go get some beverages from the local supermakets. Otherwise, this is the number one place to stay probably in all the islands.",May 2008,April 2008,Traveled as a couple,,"NY, NY"

15055152,50,Growing,"We have stayed at this property several times over the course of several years. We were there over spring break and it was very busy. The problem is that as the entire area keeps getting built up (more homes) there is more of a demand for the restaurants and the recreational facilities. My 11 year old got up early (6:30) every morning to claim our chairs by the pool and we made dinner reservations a couple of weeks in advance. We do enjoy the property very much. The service, the spa, was perfect or made to be perfect by the Four Seasons. I recommend making reservations ahead of your vacation and also going off of the property to Merriman's or Roy's for dinner (which will be less costly).",Apr 2008,March 2008,Traveled with family,,"Orange County, CA"

While the properity was well maintained it was not up to standards of several other four seasons we have stayed in the past. This resort is like all of the other Hawaiian four seasons resorts we have been at. There is just something missing. The food was overpriced and the beach resturant was simply bad. We ate off the properity several nights at Roys or the local Tommy Bahammas. We did the beach ""stars night"" held on sat. evening and for a family of 4 with 2 glasses of wine our bill was 460$ with tip. This was there version of a beach buffet/ cookout. Although the food was good, to me and likely most others this is excessive. Skip the managers cocktail party as it was dull and uninformative.The ATV tour was fun and had amazing views of the kona /kohala coast and farmland.  We have been to all of the FS properities in Hawaii. I will say that the golf courses are great at all the resorts ,as they should be for 250$ a round.

14783047,20,Overcrowded and Overwhelmed,"We stayed at the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai on Hawaii for a week starting Easter weekend. Unfortunately, this was also Spring Break week. The hotel staff was overwhelmed and simply not able to cope. The staff tried their best but service suffered. If you wanted a beach chair or a chair by the pool, you had to set up early in the morning, otherwise you were out of luck. For these prices, you expect a better level of service. The rooms were also very shabby looking. I do not think our room had been painted in over 3 years. We will not go back to this hotel!",Apr 2008,March 2008,Traveled as a couple,,
14672519,40,Nice but not prepared for the crowds- staff seemed overwhelmed.,"Just got back from a week stay for Spring Break 3/21- 3/28. Let's see, where do I start? Well, although many people love it, we did not. Yes there are some things that were nice, but we have stayed at many five star resorts and this was a bit over rated. When I make reservations at a Four Seasons and pay $950 for a room, (we had 2 rooms) I expect excellent service. That is what I expect at Four Seasons resorts. That should be standard. It was not excellent, it was only OK. First, it was Spring Break and my biggest problem the whole week was that the hotel was not able to accommodate all the guests at the either the pool or the beach!? The first three days I went out to the pool/beach and asked for a chair. ""Sorry, there aren't any, but we wold be happy to put you on our wait list"". I am NOT JOKING! OK, I have a serious issue with this. In all my travels I have never been told that there was literally NO WHERE for us to sit in a chair. When we asked why they didn't get more chairs their response was, ""We have 30 more than last year"", well good for you, but I still want a chair this year. So we sat on the beach on a towel in between two rows of chairs in an area they couldn't put chairs because they said it , ""would block the infinity pool view"". Another family that was in the same situation was steamed and we all said that it was unacceptable. We wanted to complain to the manager, however he was in vacation on a ski trip.  Yes, the staff is attentive, yes the gym was nice (crowded) and the restaurants are good, but to me the basic premise of taking a trip to Hawaii and staying at a very nice (expensive) hotel is that you EXPECT to be accommodated at the beach. Don't most people who go to Hawaii want to sit out and read and do nothing but relax? So days 3-7 I got up at 6:30 am and went to the chairs. Then there I sat, most of the day, since if you get up for over a half an hour your seat will be given away!! (Sounds extremely relaxing eh? not at all, quite stressful really) The hotel does however give a courtesy ""lunch hold"" so you can go to one of their restaurants at lunch without the fear of losing your seat. I don't know, but it would seem that a simple solution would be to get more chairs and hire more staff for the three weeks in March/ April that constitute Spring Break? I also think that the beach there is not great. There is a small ""swimming beach"" with very rough sand. Mauna Kea beach is amazing compared to this one. We had other issues, but they were minor compared to this. (concierge mistakes, no times available to play tennis, slow service around pool and beach) I really believe that most of the problems had to do with the fact that they were not adequately staffed for the amount of people that were staying there. After all this complaining, I will say our kids had fun at the King's Pond and the Kids' Club. They also had a s'mores fire out at the beach that we discovered on the second to last day. So, kids liked it more than us, but they didn't have to pay the bill!!",Mar 2008,March 2008,Traveled with family,,"Pasadena, California"
14610989,50,Incredible Time!!,"We have just returned from four gloriuos days at the Four Seasons Hualalai Resort. The hotel and the property are both magnificent and we have never experienced such incredible service before. It was so beautiful that could not drag ourselves away from the hotel to go to the Big Island sights at all. In fact we didn't bother with the volcanoes, especially with the recent lava and ash explosions, or any of the other places friends recommended. We just enjoyed the peace and tranquility of the hotel.    We stayed in a ground level suite with its own outdoor shower and lanai. We found the breakfast buffet to be a little pricey, but a lovely spread with meats, fresh fish, waffles, cheeses, etc. During the afternoons we ate at the Residents' Beach House. The food there was great and reasonable.    The pool was lovely, with an infinity edge and luxurious appointments. We enjoyed it our second day. The pool attendants were wonderful, bringing out 2 towels per sun lounger, and a cover for use with pillow (of course, a Four Seasons touch). We enjoyed the beach more; same appointments as the pool, but more crowded.    The Spa and Sports Club at Hualalai Resort is phenomenal! Great treatments (I had the Green Tea Wrap; wife had the Coconut Wrap). Expensive but fabulous.    Two of the restaurants were good; Pahui'a was about the same as the Hualalai Grille. The Beach Tree was not as good. We enjoyed the Residents' Beach House the best.    We paid what we thought was an excellent value for our accommodations. I would say this is probably the best hotel we have ever stayed in on holiday (my wife would agree; she is extremely picky about hotels). Perhaps not the most convenient if all you want to do is shop and sight-see, but if you want to have a little luxury with your rest and relaxation, then this is an absolute must.",Mar 2008,March 2008,Traveled as a couple,,Chicago
14521776,50,Great resort!,"I stayed at a villa in Hualalai from March 16 through March 19. The facilties were fantastic, from the pools to the restaurants to the beaches. The staff was attentive, and provided many little extras, from cool towels and water at the pool to fresh fruit snacks and ice cream bon bons at the beach.    Pricing at the resort is commensurate with the service - cocktails by the pool will set you back $10 to $15 per drink for specialty cocktail, $7 per beer. There is a $30 activity fee per person per day for use of the facilities - gym, etc. You can't opt out of this fee.    For those of you looking for adventure, the resort will arrange activities from surfing to fishing to hiking. I recommend renting a car so you can explore the island at your own pace.

14508650,50,"Fabulous, Beautiful & Wonderful","I have stayed at other Four Seasons (including Four Seasons Maui) and other 5 Star hotels, but this resort is superior. It is honestly worth all the superlatives used to describe it.  Everything is done beautifully, unusually, and with a great deal of thought and personal service.  We were a family with kids, traveling with my parents and my newly married sibling and his wife. THe different areas of the resort allowed all of us to enjoy it. My parents and brother enjoyed the quiet/adult pool, while we spent a good amount of tme at the sea shell pool and small beach area. Our room overlooked a lava rock lagoon stocked with tropical fish that is used for snorkeling and my brother and daughter did enjoy the snorkeling in it. My son and I took some of the tennis clinics offered. THe courts are beautifully maintained and there is an active and very good quality tennis program being run (at least over spring break). My daughter and I took a yoga class, and she and her father took a water fitness class. THe fitness center is excellent with good equipment and plenty of class offerings. I personally found the spa to be unexeceptional although others on this site have raved about it. It was perfectly fine, but nothing special. THe locker area was small, they did not have any special whirlpool tubs or anything like that, the treatments were standard for a nice hotel.  My children made use of the activities at the cultural center (various art projects), and enjoyed the free daily treats distributed at the pool (pineapple slices, ice cream cubes, evian face mists, etc.). Every night a schedule of the next days activities was distributed and there was alot to chose from.  We ate at all the restaurants, and all were good. The breakfast buffet is great, the pool side lunch is good but really pricey, there is another nice lunch option further down the beach at the ""residents club"". The best part of all these restaurants is that they offer a good children's menu, offering both chicken finger type options, and ""junior gourmet"" options, AND a TEEN menu. The TEEN menu was a wonderful option for my daughter who is too old (in her mind) for the children's menu but doesnt need a $45 entree. The cultural center also offered at least one teen activity each day which she took advantage of. Several nights there were smores ingredients for the kids set up on the beach and the kids loved roasting the marshmellows.  The rooms were beautifully done in natural materials and everyone loved the outdoor shower.  If you wanted to be critical of anything about the resort, it was that the beach is too small, and non-existent if you are a real beach swimmer. And the food prices are very expensive.

14144135,50,Aloha at Its Finest,"We just returned from the Four Seasons on the Big Island. Our experience was fantastic - can't wait to go back! This is by far the best resort area we have been to. The things that stood out for us-    *Excellent exercise path along the water through the lava fields-about a mile long which can be extended for a 3.4 mile jog or 5.2 mile jog. This was the highlight of our day.    *The rooms are all close to the ocean. (Except golf view rooms)  *This was more of a resort than a hotel. 2 story villas and amazing grounds create this feel.    *Baby pool is shaded by a tiki hut umbrella and has a non-sticky sand bottom. Toys galore were provided as well as swim diapers. We have a 10 month old that loved it every day! Adjacent is a large kids' pool area. The accommodations for families were situated around this area of the resort which allowed people without children to enjoy their time as well.    *In addition to the family pool area, there were 4 more pool areas. One is dedicated as a ""quiet pool"" - a nice area for adults and no cell phones! There was a lap pool in the spa area.    *All pools were right on the ocean.    *Restaurants were great, though expensive.    *EVERYONE was super friendly. Aloha and relaxed.    *The spa treatments were amazing and in a great outdoor area. I was a little disappointed with the spa locker room area and waiting area. I felt a little cramped and like I didn't have room to get dressed.    *We went off the resort a little to see the island because it was out first visit. Next time, I think we will just stay on the resort the entire time!    *We paid big bucks for this vacation so our expectations were high - and all expectations were exceeded.    We went to the Four Seasons on Maui for the following week. We had stayed there before and really enjoyed it. Unfortunately, after being on the Big Island, we found our week on Maui disappointing.

I especially enjoyed the King's Pond snorkel area. I love to skin and scuba dive but my girlfriend has had a bit of phobia about the open ocean. This was a great way to break her in to the concept. She loved it. I don't have kids yet but I imagine this would be a great way for them to learn about the ocean. They have the large pond stocked with 17 type of tropical fish and 5 Eagle Rays.

13523974,50,Absolutely the best resort we have ever enjoyed!,"We celebrated our 10th wedding anniversary at the Four Seasons Hualalai and really wanted to do something special. From the time I began booking the trip it was a great experience. The reservations desk connected me with one of the concierges, Shandy. She was fantastic and helped me book some great surprises from my wife. She also took a personal interest and helped connect me with a local Ukulele maker who makes beautiful koa ukes.    Shandy passed me over to Kalai who does the dining reservations at the resort and she set up a couple fantastic dinners on the beach and some great in room dining that was simply perfect. The food was from Pahuia and was perfecly prepared and served by our private server, Leslie, who was really fun and made the dinners on the beach really special. When we got back to our room, Kalai had a photograph of us from our dinner on the beach waiting on our bed along with a Ukulele song book she had grown up with and recommended. She went way out of her way to make us feel very welcome and it worked.    The spa was also top notch. I had a couple of massages and my wife had a facial and a mani/pedi at the salon. Incredibly relaxing experience that makes you just want to spend a week in the spa alone!    The golf course was also fun to play with a beautiful layout that stretches through lava fields and bazillion dollar homes. It had generous fairways that feed the ball perfectly and contribute to the relaxed and welcoming pace of the entire resort. Not a terribly challening course, but then again, you are there to relax!    The pools were just what the doctor ordered. We spent our time at the Beach Tree pool which was very quiet and carried the same attention to detail and comfort the rest of the resort has. When we got to the pool the first day, they wished us a happy anniversary and brought us drinks as we sat down. That is service! What is really great is how low key the pool (and entire resort for that matter) really was. They pool staff is incredibly attentive. We had a few rain bursts and they would run over and help us move to a cabana to bring us drinks and then move us back to chairs when the sprinkle passed.    The room was like home. We booked a one bedroom executive suite and initially had one that overlooked the kings pond. When we arrived in the room, there was Champagne, fruit, candies, and snacks all laid out with a note wishing us a happy anniversary. Our room (711) faced west-northwest and really didn't have a sunset view. Since we really wanted to see the sunset from our room, I called the front desk the first night to see what they could arrange. The next day, they moved us to room 1911 which overlooks the Beach Tree pool. In typical Four Seasons fashion we did not have to lift a finger. They gathered our belongings and moved them to the new room while we were at the pool and then gave me a call on my mobile phone to let us know to stop by the front desk to pick up our new keys.    We spent 10 days at the resort and ventured off of the property for a couple dinners and lunches and each time couldn't wait to get back to the resort. The people, the pace, the beauty, the food, the spa, the pools, etc., etc., etc. Unsurpassed. It is no wonder this has been rated as the best resort in Hawaii. We will be back and reccomend it highly.    Thanks to Kalai, Shandy, Leslie, and Danette for making it perfect!",Feb 2008,December 2007,Traveled as a couple,,"Chicago, Illinois"

12585281,50,Best Hotel in Hawaii,"We stayed here for our honeymoon and couldn't have been happier. The grounds were amazing. The service was outstanding. The rooms were great (make sure you get a room on the first floor to get the private outdoor shower). There are several pools and restaurants and plenty to do. If you rent a car you can go into town and walk around or eat dinner, but the food at the hotel couldn't be beat. If you like lobster, they do a buffet on the beach and they served grilled lobster tails. I must of had 6 of them (they were smaller).    We went back and forth deciding whether we would stay here or the Fairmont because the Four Seasons was much more expensive and I have say this hotel was worth every penny. We barely left the resort, which was rare for us, and had the best times of our lives.",Jan 2008,October 2006,Traveled as a couple,,"Pine Castle, Florida"
12399547,40,great but hectic holiday,"I travelled from London to this property with my family with high expectations. The rooms are a huge let down, compared to other Four Seasons resorts we have stayed at. They are very average. The beach is not as fabulous as I thought it would be. However, the spa is amazing and the range of activities on offer for all age groups is outstanding! The pools are beautiful. Xmas time is crazy at this hotel--mostly regulars--very much a social scene.",Jan 2008,December 2006,,,LONDON
12309352,50,This is why we stay at the Four Seasons!,"My husband and I celebrated our 19th anniversary at the FS Hualalai in October 2007. We have been there before, in 2004 and 2005, and each trip has a special place in my heart. This past trip, however, was extra special. It wasn't the room or the location, although both of those are beyond compare. This trip was special because of the staff.    I have an extreme food allergy to soy and peanuts, and even a miniscule amount has given me anaphylactic reactions. Reactions happen not just from the ingredient being in my food--I've had reactions traced to the utensils or pans being used for foods with the allergen, and then used to prepare mine. This makes it extremely difficult to eat out at home, let alone on vacation. Peanuts aren't too difficult to stay away from, as most people are aware of peanut allergies. But soy...that's a hard one. Take this challenge: go to your cupboard or your fridge and pull out anything, bread, crackers, cereal, cookies, junk food, salad dressing--anything--- and take a look at the ingredients. You probably will find soy listed.    I hate to bring up my allergy, especially to people I don't know. But sometimes, as in eating out, there is no choice. I can't eat something when I don't know the ingredients - so, I e-mailed the hotel in advance of my stay to let them know about my allergy. By the time we arrived at the Beach Tree restaurant for our first meal, the staff had already been informed. The restaurant manager and the chef came to our table and introduced themselves. The chef asked what we wanted, and then personally prepared it and brought it to our table, after making sure that all utensils and pans were washed before my food was made. And then that same thing happened at every meal thereafter. It's hard to explain how unusual that is. At most restaurants, after I give my ""chef card"" to the waiter (a printed card that explains my allergy), the waiter usually talks to the kitchen staff, and then comes back and tells me everything I can't have, which is usually almost everything on the menu. I have ended up with lettuce and salt & pepper more times that I care to remember. This is the first time EVER that a chef asked me what I was hungry for, then made suggestions for necessary changes, and then brought me an amazing meal.    That's service.",Jan 2008,October 2007,,,Illinois
12091949,50,Christmas Day Dinner,We did not stay at this hotel but rather enjoyed Christmas dinner there. We called the day before and requested reservations for the Haulalai Grille by Alan Wong and were told that since we were not staying guests we would have to call back the next day at 8:00 am. That is just what we did and got a 5:30 pm dinner reservation. The drive out to the Hotel takes about 20 minutes depending on the time of day. The site is well secured and they checked our reservation at the gate before we could enter. The lounge connected to the dining room was all open air and just lovely. As we were seated a young hawaiian man traveled the trails on the complex and blew his conch horn while lighting the tiki torches. My daughter and I ordered the dinner sampler which was priced at $70.00 pp along with the wines it came to $100.00 pp. Although this might seem high to some being Christmas we went for it. That was the best meal I have ever had and it was so much fun to try the 7 courses with the wines. I will always remember this time and would suggest trying the dinner sampler to anyone. Each presentation was outstanding and we made yummy sounds the whole meal.,Dec 2007,December 2007,Traveled as a couple,,"West Columbia, Texas"
12028321,40,Nice stay,Probably the nicest hotel we stayed at during our Hawaiian vacation. The spaced out accomodation blocks and landscaping hides the scale of the hotel which was a big plus as a boutique hotel fan. Food was of a good standard. Outdoor rock shower a nice touch.,Dec 2007,September 2006,Traveled as a couple,,"New York City, New York"
10098221,50,Nice Change of Pace at Hualalai,"My wife and I stayed here for 3 days before heading to the Four Seasons Maui (see my other review). We stayed here primarily to satisfy my curiosity about this hotel, and I wasn't disappointed. I have nothing but nice things to say about the place, but ultimately, I think it boils down to this:    If you live on the West Coast, you really ought to come here. If you live on the East Coast, you might be able to get the same experience in the Caribbean, which is a much shorter trip. I'll try to explain below.    The resort is amazing. Well-manicured, well-designed, and you instantly feel special once you arrive. The rooms are spread out in 2-level buildings. To me, it had the feel of some of the nice Caribbean resorts (Peter Island, Little Dix, etc.) in this regard. It is nothing like the Four Seasons Maui in terms of layout. I guess it just depends on what you're looking for as far as which one is better.    The rooms are incredible. Ours had a nice ocean view and also had the outdoor shower. We loved the outdoor shower, which was very private. Ironically, the more expensive rooms do not have them -- that's because they have the upper level view, and the outdoor showers are all on the bottom level. The rooms have beautiful, large bathrooms. The furniture feels very Hawaiian and everything was clean and seemed new.    We spent most of our time by the Beachtree pool. The main pool, Seashell, was closed for renovation. Let me pause to say one thing here: the hotel did a wonderful job of disguising the work that was being done. Not only had they constructed a fence around the worksite, but the fence was bamboo, so it almost blended in! This isn't by accident. This is what you get with the Four Seasons. Anyway, I would love to see what the pool looks like when it's done, because it looks really nice and sits behind the best spot of beach at the resort (more on the beach below). The Beachtree is typically a quiet pool, but they were allowing children a little more leeway while we were there due to the construction. We had no problem getting chairs, even though an entire pool area was closed.    The King's Pond was nice, and a great way to snorkel in an contained environment. The adult pool on the Palm Grove crescent was small but nice and very secluded. One suggestion for the Four Seasons: Provide a few more umbrellas here. There were plenty of chairs by this pool, but only one had an umbrella, and the same woman put her bag on it every morning by 7am, which I thought was a little tacky. She'd put her stuff down, then take a long walk, and then maybe return 2 hours later. Fortunately for us, we preferred the Beachtree pool, where this sort of thing is generally prevented.    Don't come here if you're looking primarily for a beach. I knew that going in, so I wasn't disappointed. You either can't swim with all the rocks, or if you do force the issue, it really wouldn't be all that enjoyable. The views are beautiful and the pools are more than enough and are right by the ocean, but there are lots of rock and the sand on the beach is pretty steep in most places. If the beach is most important to you, you'd be much happier elsewhere.    The food was a minor disappointment. The breakfast buffet was the best I've ever had. Service by the pool here was better than at the Four Seasons Maui. The Saturday night beach BBQ (also a buffet) had a lot of delicious items to choose from, including sushi and lobster tails. Frankly, we were underwhelmed with the restaurants for dinner. We ate at the Beach grill and Alan Wong's, in addition to the beach BBQ, and it wasn't so much that the food wasn't good. It was fine. But you'd like better than fine, and you'd like better selection. My wife and I love good food, but after looking at the menu at Alan Wong's, we decided to just share some appetizers. The lunch menu is OK, but again, the selection wasn't ideal.    The spa/health club was my favorite part. Great workout areas, not crowded and wonderful spa treatments. I highly recommend the men's (kane) facial. My wife enjoyed her massage as much as any she's ever had. One complaint: the steam room was uncomfortably hot! (haha) I know this sounds dumb, of course a steam room would be hot, but this was very, very hot and had so much steam that you couldn't find your way out. I got used to it after the first day and it was fine.    At the end of the day, we loved this place. But to be honest, it wasn't much better (if at all) than our experience at Peter Island, and the food and beach at Peter Island were a lot better. That's why I say that if you're on the East Coast, try one of the nice places in the Caribbean, unless you're as obsessed with this place as I was. However, if you live on the West Coast, this is a great option.    if you're debating between Maui and Hualalai, I can't comment on the Big Island in general because we didn't have a car and never left the resort (we were only there for 3 days and used this time to get adjusted to Hawaii time). If you're looking for a true getaway and you value seclusion, Hualalai wins. You can be around people, or you can get away from them. If you don't mind more of a hotel feel, and want a better beach, then the Four Seasons Maui wins hands down.

10077683,40,"Nice, but not as good as expected","Usually when we visit the Big Island, we stay at the Mauna Lani. I absolutely adore the Mauna Lani, we got married there in 2005 and had the most memorable gorgeous wedding. So glad we did that.    I've heard so much about the FS though, we had to check it out. As you can imagine, my expectations would be pretty high. Specially since in 2006 we went to the George V in Paris (another FS property), and were very impressed with the service.    We were arriving on the Big Island after spending 5nights on Kauai, which was a bit of a disappointment, but that's a different review....    The lobby was just gorgeous. The reception upon arriving, could do with a few changes. While waiting at the front desk, trying to check in (which is obvious, since we are wearing leis), I was surprised that no one asked us to sit and relax and enjoy some refreshments. Instead, we had to wait in line and and check-in standing up, were hurriedly passed some refreshments as we checked in. Just didn't feel as relaxing as it could have been.    Considering, the hotel was only 70% full when we were there, I'm really surprised the overall service wasn't better.    Our room was absolutely beautiful. We had a room overlooking the Kings pool and was Ocean View. Considering how expensive this room was, I did feel like the room was really exposed (and it was!). The Kings pool is a very cool pool that is open from 10am until 4pm and you can snorkel in it. Snorkel gear is provided. They have all kinds of fish and 3 eagle rays that you can feed also. We feed the eagle rays and they were so sweet. Our lanai looked out to the pool, and when we had breakfast, everyone going to the pool can see you, and do look. In fact, they can see into your room if you don't have the plantain shutters pulled. So, if you're wanting privacy and don't wish for an audience, pull the shutters closed. :) That was the biggest problem I had with our room.    Dining onsite was the biggest disappointment I had at the resort.    On our first night, we dined at Pahui'a. We made reservations that day for it, and were told that earliest reservation was for 7:30pm. That's fine for us, as we usually eat late. Service was slow. First and foremost....that was the biggest disappointment here. The food was just excellent! I was very happy we decided to eat there. Our waitress was so flustered she actually had someone else serve us for a time, but honestly by then, I was too annoyed with the original waitress to give any leeway. I just don't understand...the hotel is only 70% full, it was already almost 8pm, the restaurant was pretty empty, and yet, she was really slow. It took over 15 minutes for her to come by and take our order. In fact, she had someone else come over and take our order finally. The food was excellent though...    The Hualalai Grille was the biggest disappointment of all. That was one of the WORST meals I've had in a long time. The service was deplorable, the food was hideous. The only good thing was the red and yellow tomato soup. That was excellent. Otherwise, we spent over $100 without wine on a meal that was just a waste of time. We would have been happier at McDonald's.    On a good note, the In-Room dining, was really delicious. Breakfast every morning was just perfect. We ordered lunch and our selections were very tasty.    The spa, was very nice and relaxing. Everyone there was pleasant. It was kind of weird though, I thought, they have you pay for your service beforehand. They also charge you a mandatory 20% gratuity, and then there is another line for extra tip. All this before the service! Frankly, I'm irritated that the tip is not my choice, and it's before the service. What if I wasn't really happy? I might want to tip less than 20%, or if they were really stellar, I'd want to tip more than 20%. That I found very irritating.    Would I go back???? The property is beautiful, a bit more upscale than the Mauna Lani, but there are some serious issues with service. So, I guess, if they were having a special, I would consider it, but I would not have dinner there, nor would I have the spa services again. The Mauna Lani has a beautiful spa, and the people are just a bit friendlier.",Oct 2007,October 2007,Traveled as a couple,,"San Jose, California"
10058780,50,Simply Amazing,"I dont know where to start. This was the first stop for us on a 15 night 3 island trip. We stayed for 5 nights (Sept 21-26) From the moment we walked through the lobby we were in awe and the smile is still on my face. It is just so lovely and the service and staff is all top notch. They said it was the slowest they have been in years and it was so quiet it was sometimes eerie. Cabanas were available all throughout the day. The family pool was closed for renovations so there was hardly any kids at the resort. Service at the pool was divine. The fitness center was amazing. Had meals at all the restaurants that were delicious but not quite worth the $$$ but we new that going into our stay - $13 drinks - best Mai Tai. The Beach BBQ was definately worth the money - lots of yummy food.    Our room overlooking kings pond was wonderful, and snorkeling there was interesting. I spent 4 hours sitting in a beach chair watching the sea turtles come up to sun themselves - one day we saw 8 of them! Out of the three resorts we visited (Sheraton Maui and Hyatt Kauai as the other two) this one had the friendliest staff - even the other guest were friendlier!    The walking path was a wonderful start to everyday and ending the day with sunset at the pool was perfect - a couple of times we cancelled dinner ressies as we didnt want to leave our cabana!    This has now taken over as our favorite resort and we will return.",Oct 2007,September 2007,Traveled as a couple,,new hampshire
10048692,50,Stunning and Serene,"I've been meaning to write this for awhile....hope my memory still serves me well.  My husband and I stayed here for a week in July, following a week at the Kea Lani in Maui. We had lots of adventure in Maui and were probably ready to slow down a bit and relax--which is exactly what you will do here!  The basics:    Grounds: Stunning. They remind me of the grounds at the Kauai Hyatt, only a little more refined with a slight Asian feel. This beauty is what really sets the tone for your stay here. As I get older, I want less of the overstimulating ""vacation playgrounds"" and more of the pampering retreats. I loved the walking path; one moment you are in lush, tropical greens....then in a few hundred feet you enter a world of lava rock, manicured golf holes, a quaint pond, and a deserted beach off in the distance (depending on how far you walk). I would have loved to take advantage of that path a bit more, but I couldn't get over the incredible heat! I am sensitive to the sun and while I had no problems in Maui--------in Kona, my skin actually felt like it was frying and even with 50 spf applied EVERY hour, I got the worst sunburn I've had in years (I'm just sharing here...not blaming or complaining....I didn't realize the climate was so different here, so I'd thought I'd share this and let you know....um....yes...Kona is indeed a desert climate:).    Rooms: Beautiful, relaxing feel. Average size rooms with overly fluffy beds (my husband loved this, but I have back problems and was nursing a pinched sciatic nerve so the evenings involved numerous glasses of wine in order to get some sleep). Loved the outdoor shower, but truthfully, after the first or second use, it becomes more of a gorgeous backdrop to your bathroom....and besides, the regular shower is also beautiful. Great, spacious closet. Our room was overlooking the golf course, but we also had a far off view of the ocean. Quite frankly, I'm usually the one that bugs my husband to cough up the extra $ for the ocean view....but I wouldn't do that here. The rooms overlooking the golf course are more private, without foot traffic...and the way they are angled, you don't see the corner of anyone else's room/building.    Food: We ate in every restaurant and ALL were outstanding. A couple years ago in Maui we had some of the best meals that have made the top of our alltime great meals list. This year in Maui, food was....meh. Two meals in particular at this resort have been bumped to the top of that list....(one at Pahui a and one at Alan Wong's) crushing the competition of Pacific O's on Maui 3 years ago. That being said... I really must address the issue of food pricing. I know, I know....it's been addressed a million times and it's the Four Seasons and blah, blah, blah. But oh. my. gosh. $28 for *#@! omlette? Seriously? Holy price gouging. $20 would be pricey. $22 would be pushing it. $28 is criminal. I bet that omlette is delicious, though.    Pools: We only frequented the quiet pool because the pretty infinity pool was like Disneyland. In fact, whenever we walked by it, I felt as if I wasn't at the Four Seasons anymore...it felt AND LOOKED like a Marriott. The King's Pond was sooooo amazing. I can't say enough about it. Beautiful, fun, and most importantly...the only place where you could cool off. The water in the quiet pool was uncomfortably warm, and I was too worried about sea urchins in the roped off area of the ocean. But...the quiet pool area was very relaxing and the service there was superb. One thing that bugged me though, was the sense of entitlement some guest had during our stay. There are clear rules about no cell phones at the quiet pool....hence THE NAME. Still, many guests could be found pacing up and down the sides of the pool as they loudly chatted with important clients.    The Spa:  Pretty spa, with the most skilled staff. But...it didn't wow me. Many have. This one didn't. And once again, the prices are ridiculous.    Hawaiian rehab: If you want to quit smoking, come here. Yes.. Smoking is grossly unhealthy, disgusting and it affects others. But if you pay a kazillion dollars to stay at a resort, shouldn't you be able to enjoy one little smoke on your lanai while sipping a glass of wine after an extraordinary day? Is that so wrong?    Overall service: Truly impressive. Especially the concierges. They can plan anything for you (from helicopter tours to finding a suitable luau with available seating at the last moment!). Ideally, one would automatically forget any memory of service here at the FS, as it will completely ruin any other future resort stays. Nothing will compare, I'm afraid.    It was an outrageously pricey stay. And yes, it was worth it.  I hope to return one day.",Oct 2007,July 2007,Traveled as a couple,,"Rochester, New York"
10044165,50,Very Nice and Very Relaxing,"The wife and I arrived at the FS Hualalai filled with high expectations and were never dissappointed....    The property was one of the most beautiful I have seen at any hotel... kind of reminds you of the FS Bali Jimbarin Bay...    The rooms are spread out in half moon crescents around several pools and all have ocean views with high quality FS amenities. We booked the Ocean View. Supposedly better than Partial Ocean, but I could not tell the difference. If choosen again I would probably try and get a sunset facing Prime Ocean Room. I think the only thing Full Ocean buys you is upstairs which is sometimes worth the price if you are sensitive to upstairs noise...    Great motivated FS staff did an excellent job of service (at pools, dining, etc.), above and beyond the call, even helping us with a difficult pool situation when a FS guests kids were being obnixious at the pool. As you would expect from a well run establishment, the situation was handled flawlessly by intelligent concerned FS management staff....    As far as the hotel experience, my wife and I usually never stay on the hotel grounds for an entire week, but we foud ourselves returning the car 2 days into the trip at the Hualalai. This place was the most relaxing hotel I have ever been to    Also, the food and wine was well above par, including Pahui the FS restaurant (with perhaps the best dining view in Hawaii) to Allen Wongs spectacular cuisine. The Lava Lounge (next to Pahui) also had a great appetizer list which included Mini-Kobe beef burgers that I could have eaten every day, as well as a great wine list and ""reach out and touch the Ocean"" seating that was perfect for sunset viewing...    Too many other great things are too numerous to list, including great sports facilities, activities, and what appears to be a beautiful golf course (but I promised the wife I wouldn't play the vacation away) that it would take too long to describe.    For Cost/ Benefit, you will easily spend over $1100 a day, but you will find yourself thinking that it is a bargain!!    Highly recommended...

10004669,50,Gorgeous and Luxurious,"Stayed here at the end of our Hawaii trip in August of 07. The property was magnificent and gorgeous and we loved every minute of it. Try to book a room near the adult pool, its much quieter and there are no children, which are nearly everywhere else on the property. Incredible amounts of kids. The restaurants were fine, not up to Four Seasons standards. The bartenders didn't even know how to make a Sidecar. The hotel is not really near much of anything, so you spend your entire stay on the property and spend spend spend. Cheap, it ain't.

8839741,50,Perfect Honeymoon,"Without question, this is the pinnacle of resorts in the United States. How anyone could not absolutely love this place is beyond me. My wife and I stayed here in June 2007 for five nights as part of our honeymoon. (We came from our wedding and 8 nights at the 4S Wailea, and before going to the 2 4Ss on Lanai--see my other reviews).    This property is immaculate. Everything about our stay was perfect and I can not imagine a nicer place for a honeymoon. We choose to stay in Hawaii rather than go to Tahiti and we were super glad we did.    Flying into the Kona airport, you can not fathom that a place such as this exists on the island. A short 20 minute ride from the airport and you are in absolute paradise. The drive cuts through the glorious golf course (I shot a 92--it was difficult) and by the esteemed Nanea private course (my buddy got me on there), and down to the edge of the island on Hualalai.    The reception area is a gorgeous windowless hut-looking structure that fits into the scenery. Walking out of this building you can look over the Beach Tree pool down to the beach and the view is breathtaking. They drive you to your room, and they had upgraded us to a first floor room right on the beach and next to the Beach Tree Pool. This is important if you are traveling without kids because its the private quiet pool and its amazing. The pool is the nicest I've ever been in and I have lived and traveled in pool-heavens Arizona, Australia, Colorado, and California.    The room itself was roomy, authentic, and clean. We had an outdoor lava-shower, which was just amazing. We took showers for no reason just to go out there. They provide you with awesome Hawaiian/Japanese robes and L'Ocitaine toiletries.    The Spa and Fitness Center were like an actual Gym. It was huge, the largest I have ever seen at a hotel complete with every weight set you need. Half of it was outside. There were tennis courts, a basketball court, a huge climbing wall, and a nice lap pool. They also provide you with a neat running map for runs along the beach.    The Restaurants were to die for. We had breakfast every morning at Pahuia with the buffet and it was without question the best buffet I've ever had. (and I eat alot). Among the people eating with us were, John McEnroe and Robert DeNiro. Book the bed and breakfast package and this is included.    For Lunch, the Beach Tree Grill has simple good food that they serve to AT THE BEACH or by the pool. All you do is put the flag up on your chair/cabana and they come right over. The Pool side service was ridiculous. They came by every 30 minutes with something else free. Food/Spritzers/sunscreen/water/towels/otter pops, you name it. They took this to a whole other level. BTW, if you want one of the prime cabanas by the Beach Tree Pool, get there early.    For dinner, you can go to Pahuia, or the Hualalai grill. My advice, go to the Hualalai Grill. Food is incredible. Get the fish special, order the tomato appetizer, drink the perfectly paired wine.    If you are lucky to be there on a Saturday night, the Beach Tree Grill does a huge Sand and Stars buffet on the beach. They break out tables and have a ridiculous amount of food. And good food. Sushi, fresh fish, BBQ meats, salads, desserts, you name it. This is a hugely popular event. Its expensive ($80 a person) but worth it. I ate more than $80 worth of sashimi alone.    For the kids, they have a kids pool, tons of toys, a play area, a private snorkeling pool (King's pond) that is full of wildlife. You can also see endangered sea turtles come right up on the beach.    Another cool feature is the Hualalai general store. Each room has a fridge, so you can walk over to the store and pick up any number of items.    In short, this is the most fantastic place I've ever been. I can't gush enough about it.    It is no coincidence that more of the world's billionaires have homes here than anywhere else. (all three KKR raiders have homes here, Charles Schwab, Yang-CEO of Yahoo, the GOOGLE boys, president of USC, George Lucas, etc.)    If you can afford the $1000 a night tabs, make this your next destination. PM me if you want any more details. (I could go on and on)    Aloha",Sep 2007,June 2007,,,Denver
8740643,10,More babies/kids than Disney World (impossible to relax) - Very Noisy Rooms,"My wife and I decided to celebrate our 10 year Anniversary with the folks at the Hualalai Four Seasons. We typically stay at the Hyatt in Kauai but thought this resort would provide the luxury, romance and exclusivity of a ""very high-end"" resort for our 10 year. Plus, we've read that this resort is the best and wanted to celebrate accordingly.    First Impressions:  As we arrived at the resort and parked, so the valet attendant could unload the car, we had to summon an attendant for assistance. We were escorted to our room by a valet, not a bell captain who is familiar with the room. While the valet did the best he could do to explain the room and its amenities, there were several things he could not explain (at our rate per night, we should have had someone who is trained in this area - picky yes, but for $919.00 per night, I should be). Dinner at the Beachside Bar and Grill (whatever the name) was similar to a Chilis restaurant back on the mainland - we were seated at a dirty table with ketchup, BBQ sauce, and french fries scattered on the table, chairs, and ground. We asked for it to be cleaned and they said ""no problem"". Ten minutes later, we asked again (no service or wait staff ever approached our table during this time). The menu was very limited and after one pizza, one fish plate, and one glass of wine, our total was $92.00.    Noisy Rooms:  The hotel grounds are perfect. They did a nice job creating a lush, tropical garden in a very ""moonscape"" envrionment (the Kona side of the island is very, very dry). The bungalow style rooms provide a sense of privacy and tranquility - it stops here...Some earlier reports have commented about ""thin walls"" and noisy neighbors. We booked a second floor room to help eleviate these concerns - doesn't help! We heard every drawer open, every foot step, and every door slam in the adjacent room. The sound of the 4-year old running to and from the lanai door (and opening it over and over) never ceased. While the room decor and amenities are very nice, we find it totally unacceptable to pay over $900 per night for a room with paper thin walls. Even basic chain hotels provide better insulation than this Four Seasons resort. We even turned the clock radio to a ""blank"" radio station for an attempt at some white noise.    Pool Etiquette:  This was a real eye-opener - who would have thought you litererally had to make a ""lounge chair reservation"" to sit by the pool? Half of the ""quite pool"" looks like a tent city (too many cabanas) and the other half of the chairs are empty - but reserved. They have a policy that you can actually leave your seat for up to a two-hour period to ""enjoy"" lunch between 11A - 2P (I know that is three hours - you can leave during that time period). We wound up sitting by the ocean. It's actually a better view than the pool. The pool is as boring a rectangle - no activity - just people sitting by the pool - might as well be a mirror reflecting the ""blue"" from the sky.    Babies and Toddlers; Toddlers and Babies:  As parents, we completely understand that children are a part of life. We even understand that parents take their children on vacations. What we don't understand is why every baby and toddler from the mainland stayed at the Fours Seasons during our visit (figuratively speaking). While we were fortunate enough to make the 8.5 hour flight without our kids, we are still amazed at the number of very small children who make the 5 hour flight from California cities. There were more babies and toddlers at this resort than we've ever noticed at much larger resorts on other islands. This has nothing to do about the Four Seasons as a resort, but they make little to no mention of the fact that they STRONGLY cater to families with small children. Sitting next to 12 and 18 month olds who bang jelly jars on the table and five year olds who run around your table throwing rocks, etc, does not lend itself to a very relaxing and romantic vacation. It also appeared that the parents ""took a vacation"" from enforcing any discipline to their little ones as well. This was dissappointing and showed a lack of respect to other guests at the resort.    In all, let us be the ones to offer dissent on one of the most celebrated resorts of the islands. We're not saying ""don't go"". But be aware of the value! We cut our stay short after two nights and flew to Kauai to complete our vacation. The resort staff did the right thing to allow us to leave without recourse. I applaud their attitude to help us and have no bad words for the staff.    We now understand that exclusivity, solitude, and romantic getaway don't necessarily correlate. We were looking forward to a very relaxing, romantic, and quite getaway and thought we were paying the right price for it...We were very dissappointed and the hotel did not meet several of our expectations for our vacation.",Sep 2007,August 2007,Traveled as a couple,,"Plano, Texas"

8617231,40,slipping,"The Four Seasons Hualalai is still one of our favorite resorts to visit. We visit at least once year to a year to a year and a half. On this particular trip, we noticed that the hotel was slipping in its service. My wife and I were there for over a week with our two young sons. The mishaps were not all that serious, but they stood out because we have come to expect certain things. For instance on this visit, the resort usually spells out our boys' name with colored sponges and placed on the bath tub prior to arrival. Our oldest ran to the bathroom upon entering the room to see his name. He was disappointed to find there were no sponges in his or his brother's name. We had made several reservations and changes with the concierge. We never heard back on two confirmations. We found that the price for the breakfast buffet had increased by a few dollars since our last stay, but we found the buffet lacked variety from day to day. We noticed that on this trip, the staff did not call us by our names (restaurant and pool) even though the same staff waited or assisted us the day prior. Additionally, the staff is usually great in greeting you with an ""aloha"" or a smile when encountering them throughout the property. Many, on this trip, did not even look up while passing them. We noticed that valet parking is now $12 per day (no charge in the past.) This is minimal, but just add it to the room charge! Don't make your guests feel nickeled and dimed! Suggestion: The bathroom floor needs to me cleaned (mopped) at least for each new occupant. I wiped spilled milk on the bathroom floor and wiped it with one on the white towels. It turned colored from the imbedded dirt. (We notice this on our last stay too.) Hualalai Coffee Company (although not run by the hotel) should have sandwiches/salads earlier than 11:00 (i.e 10:30 am) for those people that may want to pick up food prior to taking off for the airport to take the 12:30/1:30 flights back to LAX or SFO. Again, these are minor issues, but when you come to expect things and compare them to the last visits they do stand out, and appear that service has slipped.",Sep 2007,August 2007,Traveled with family,,San Francisco
8615667,50,Hawaiian Paradise,"The Four Seasons Hualalai is incredible. The setting is an indescribably perfect paradise and the service is personal and beyond anything my husband or I could have anticipated. Our room was beautiful and had every imaginable amenity. I don’t think I ever had a hotel room that had a walk-in closet before. We had both an indoor shower and an outdoor lava rock shower that was a really fun and unique touch. Sunday evening at sunset, we saw some children and families roasting marshmallows on the beach – and realized the hotel had set up a little “smores” table. I couldn’t help myself – toasted a couple of marshmallows myself. I can’t even remember how long it’s been since I’ve done that!    We had dinner at the Hualalai Grill and decided to try the dinner ""tasting"" menu with the wine pairing selections. The food was wonderful and I would definitely recommend the tasting menu.    The pool closest to our room (Beach Tree) was technically open 24 hours, though not supervised after 8:00 or so. It was so beautiful and peaceful – we went swimming around 11:00 pm in the moonlight and were the only ones there. The water was almost like bathwater so it was so comfortable – I could have stayed there all night.    I can't wait to go back.",Sep 2007,August 2007,Traveled on business,,"Bangor, Maine"
8375958,50,Believe the hype on the Four Seasons Hualalai!,"Beautiful, private, quiet, serene, decadent, tropical, indulgent - the Four Seasons Hualalai is all these things and more. I stayed for a week in early June 2007 in their 'cheapest' accommodation overlooking the golf course. Personally, I would not pay more for a view, and the closer the room is to the ocean, the more foot traffic there is. Anyway, the room was lovely. Slate floors, marble bathroom with separate tub and shower, poofy bed, flat screen TV, balcony, large closet with thoughtful things like bug spray, a flashlight and the like. One thing I really liked about the FS is that other than the staggeringly high room rate, I did not feel nickel and dimed. I was able to self-park in front of my room. There is free coffee all over the resort in the morning, and yummy muffins in the main building early in the morning. I would not have thought that tofu cinnamon muffins would be so addictive! I tried almost all the restaurants, and the food and service was fantastic at each. I do wish there was a more casual alternative sit down restaurant for breakfast, but this is a minor quibble. There was free computer access in a room just off reception. Lots of free water all over the property.    I did not spend much time at the pools but the service there was also top notch.There is really no swimming beach, which did not matter to me. There is one small sandy area where turtles swim that I enjoyed one morning. Don't miss the programs at the Cultural Center on the ground floor of the main building. There is a treasure trove of artifacts and very knowledgeable native Hawaiians who staff the place. I had a couple of treatments in the salon. Nothing to write home about, although the space is nice.    The resort is located between halfway between two areas with stores, each about 10 miles away. I drove all the way around the island, and although the scenery is fantastic, it was always a relief to get back to FS oasis.    I can't believe there is a better resort anywhere in the Hawaiian Islands. In fact, I can't believe there is better resort anywhere in the United States. Believe everything you have heard. It is true, but reading about it is only a fraction of the enjoyment you will have actually going there. So go!",Aug 2007,June 2007,Traveled solo,,"Minneapolis, Minnesota"
8264188,50,how we made the most of our experience at hualalai,"I booked my stay by calling the four seasons hualalai directly. they were very friendly and helpful. told me about their hotel and rooms. after i booked the room they continued to contact me through e-mail. I booked reservations for some dinners and activities ahead of time. *before i went the weather outlook didnt look good so i canceled an romantic dinner on the beach. they were very understanding.  1) the room was simple, very clean, very quiet, with very nice amenities. we had an ocean front room. so the view was amazing. not sure it was necessary because the views from the other rooms also seem nice but we splurged a little for our honeymoon and didnt regret it.  2)service was top notch. everybody was very friendly and helpful. everyone greets you and is more than willing to help you. we had many people take pictures for us. they will set up your chairs by the pool or beach with lovely towel covers and frequently come around to provide beverages, and refreshments. there are wonderful magazines to read by the pool, as well as sunscreen and hair treatment. they called to ask us when we wanted our room serviced (since we stayed in our room until late in the day). they also came to turn down the room at the end of the day. they provide free shoe cleaning service. we also utilized their free laundry room (everything you need is provided) and utilized their free business center (you have to pay for internet from the room). valet also costs $12 a day but if you park on your own its free. there is water everywhere so need to by any.  3)food & drinks- we did the tasting menu at alan wong's hualalai grille. it is a must!! we have never had better food! we also did the surf, sand, and stars barbecue. it was so worth it! only $78 and there was all you can eat lobster tails, steak and so much. the food was amazing! the ambience is killer. they set you up on the beach. you take your time, enjoy the sunset. we walked up an down the beach in between bites so we could eat more later! :) the rest of the week (we stayed 7 nights) we bought food from local places (l&l and tex drive in, both are musts!) as well as stored breakfast and snacks in the fridge. this helped us cut down costs alot!! we also bought our own liquor and made our own drinks in the room.  4)activities- the spa is top notch.you have to try at least one service! I never go to spas but enjoyed one massage. my husband enjoyed 2! the sports club is great. its the first time we really looked foward to working out during a vacation and made time to do so. its beautiful! we also went horseback riding in waipio valley (booked in throught local expedia for $75). make sure to do it through waipio valley on horseback. they were excellent tour guides, very entertaining! we spent most of ourtime by the quiet pool. we had no problems finding a chair. a couple of times we did hang out at the adult pool (nobody is ever there). and my husband really enjoyed the snorkeling pool. they provide everything you need for free.  all in all we really enjoyed our honeymoon. the weather was fantastic the whole time! even though it was raining in other areas and a hurricane passed through. it never rained once where the four seasons hotel was!",Jul 2007,July 2007,Traveled as a couple,,"Marseille, France"

We arrived here driving through the volcanic landscape with a golf course.You enter a large open air Polynesian lobby filled with large tropical floral arrangements.The vibe is totally peaceful and relaxed and the buildings are amongst the wonderful landscaping.They cart you to your room and we had a downstairs .....high ceilings and again very Polynesian with a brown marble bath with a walkout lava rock shower with potted orchids.There were some complimentary snacks (appreciated) I liked the fact there is a walk in closet ,plenty of room and a lanai. Our room was behind the adult rectangular pool but there are plenty of well located rooms surrounding a huge free form pool that the kids seemed to like.One unusual thing is a salt water tropical fish pool at the far end of the property.You can snorkel in it and they feed the rays in the evening. The food was amazing here at all the places and they have a luau area for large groups.The brunch was the best I've encountered with everything from lox to miso soup and the most delicious fruit and custom omelettes,and fresh breads.Service is excellent as well .I had a few massages at the spa and it was very nice with outdoor pavilions...I had a hot rock treatment.It was the best spa experience to so far.Breakfast with the ocean breeze and view of that beautiful hawaiian blue ocean was heaven.We also saw a celebrity.Theres plenty of thing to do on the Big Island but you wont want to leave",Jul 2007,March 2003,Traveled on business,,"Orlando, Florida"
8184257,50,Very relaxing,"We stayed in April with our 4 year old and our 7 month old. The resort was wonderful. After venturing out of the resort a couple of times into the traffic of the big island, we realized that with 2 young ones we should just stay put. We got the bed and breakfast package and enjoyed going to the restaurant every day. Delicious. They will make the macadamia nut pancakes for you on off days and, depending on who makes it, they have wonderful mochas. We enjoyed the kids pool area (it was kind of disappointing not being able to use the adult pool area the whole time, but I understand) and having our own beach hut in the shade. They set up a pack 'n play for the babies to nap in by the pool--heaven. We used the nanny service a couple of times and our nannies (Suzie and her mom) were wonderful. I loved the outdoor shower--it was like being in a rainforest. They had everything I needed for the baby. We took a great surf lesson that the resort set up for us (not the usual company they work with, but one in town). The best evening was when we had already checked out, but our plane did not leave until 11pm and we sat by the pool until 7pm and enjoyed the quietness and the sunset. We have stayed at several FS and this one met our expectations. Unfortunately, it raises our expectations for other hotels. The only drawbacks that I recall were the high, high price of food (oh well) and the length of time it takes to drive anywhere from here. I would definitely recommend this property.",Jul 2007,April 2007,Traveled with family,,"Templeton, California"

We found the conceirge desk to be rather unwilling to help us when their Sundries shop ran out of saline solution. They could courrier it down from the next town over for $80. It is the 4 seasons after all, so I wasn't planning on having something like this arise. When it did staff was surprisingly unhelpful. Then, walking home one night (many of the rooms to the north of the main area go by the workers facility, why I have no idea), someone threw a block of sushi over my head. Yes, you read that correctly.

7721605,40,Very nice,"We stayed at the Four Seasons for 2 nights recently and enjoyed our time there. After spending several days on Kauai, we found that we missed all the flowers and lushness. The grounds were very different at the Four Seasons but with interesting plantings. We had to wait about an hour and a half for our room to be ready even though we had told them in advance of our arrival at 3:00pm. They did treat us to a cold drink during our wait, though. Our room was really nice - loved the outside shower. We were disappointed in the Alan Wong restaurant - expensive and just ok foodwise. There are 2 pools here to swim in. One large rectangular one and a beautiful one designated for kids (we actually like this one best). Couldn't really swim in the ocean as it is pretty rough. One of the things we liked best was the long ""boardwalk"" along the ocean. We took a mile or two walk on it each morning. The Terrace Grill was just ok, too. The spa was beautiful. We couldn't figure out what made this hotel so much better than the others but we did have a good time. Many staff members drive around in golf carts and each one of them says ""Aloha"". It seemed a little fake and each time you had to interrupt ytour conversation to respond. Not sure if I would need to stay here next time.

7657064,50,"Fantastic, top notch, incredible hotel from top to bottom!","My husband and I just returned from a 7 night stay at the Four Seasons Hualalai. We do not have the words to express what an incredibly unique and special property this is. We've travelled quite a bit, and have visited many Four Seasons properties, so our expectations were HIGH and we are thrilled to report that our expectations were exceeded at every turn.    A Four Seasons employee met us at baggage claim and steered us to a car which we'd arranged to take us to the hotel--about a 20 minute drive. Upon check-in the reception desk greeted us with a big ""Welcome! We've been expecting you"" and handed us each a cold towel, a lei, and a glass of some kind of chilled exotic juice. We were quickly ushered to our room, which was on the ground floor of a 2 story building (all of their buildings throughout the property have only 2 stories). The room was superb--clean, well-maintained, tropical/polynesian in decor, and very very spacious--especially coming from a New York City apartment! We had a spacious lanai with a table and two chairs. In the room, we had another table and two chairs; a chaise lounge; a king size bed; a large flat screen tv, a huge walk-in closet; and an enormous bathroom with 2 sinks, a separate toilet room, a large soaking tub, a huge glass shower, and--the best part--a large, totally private, lava-stone-floor outdoor shower. We never saw or heard another guest while entering/exiting our room or while in the room itself. Housekeeping services were prompt, discreet, and efficient. We had an ocean view room--not ocean front--and were happy we didn't pay a higher rate for the different view.    The property is laid out to maximize the entire experience--lots of quiet nooks and pathways; lovely adirondak chairs for watching the sunset; multiple pools (including one which is adults only--heavenly & so peaceful!)...While there I felt like I could settle into almost any location on the property and be totally content watching the view or reading a book--this includes the lobby, any of the benches scattered throughout the property, etc. I've never before been to a property which was designed to so effectively maximize guests' privacy.    The food was EXCELLENT. The breakfast buffet at Pahui'a was huge, fresh, and delicious. Dinner at Alan Wong rivaled many top-notch restaurants in New York City. Service at all restaurants was fast, courteous, and kind.    There is a Trading Company store which sells magazines, books, bath products, snacks, drinks, etc and, next door, a coffee shop which sells great shakes, pastries, coffees, juices, etc. There are comfortable chairs for relaxing and watching the world go by outside both the Trading Company and the coffee shop.    The fitness center is absolutely incredible if you enjoy working out...it is a collection of small buildings around a center lap pool (which was almost always empty). There is a spinning/fitness class studio; a weight room; and a large room full of top-notch exercise equipment (treadmills, etc). There are also exercise machines/weight benches/etc outside, underneath a small roof, so you can run outside on a treadmill.    We had a few spa services which were all exemplary-courteous, discreet staff members and heavenly treatments.    We rented a car to drive into Kona, and instantly regretted doing so--a large cruise ship had just docked so the town felt crowded, not very elegant, and we had no desire to see Bubba Gump Shrimp or Dairy Queen when we could've been enjoying the peacefulness of the resort. We also did a helicopter tour and the trip to Mauna Kea, both organized by the Hualalai concierge--excellent, smooth, great exposure to different parts of the island, etc.    I can't say enough about how wonderful, awe-inspiring, relaxing, and beautiful this property is. It is truly unique, even within the always-superb Four Seasons brand. You will be so glad you chose to vacation at Hualalai!",May 2007,May 2007,,,new york city
7566661,50,Live like a celebrity at Hualalai,"We were lucky enough to stay at the Four Seasons Hualalai for 3 days from April 27-30 2007. This was my first stay at a Four Seasons, and the reputation that preceeds Hualalai is well-deserved. We felt like celebrities the entire time we were there and only wished we could have spent our whole trip there.  We were amazed by the beauty of the property, the wonderful service by the friendly staff, and the fantastic room. We loved the quiet pool, but also liked grabbing the chairs under the tree on the beach which makes for quite a nice ocean breeze.  We were put in room 2001, steps from the BeachTree Pool (quiet pool). The ground level rooms have the outdoor lava rock showers, and supposedly no view of the ocean. I'm not sure why anyone would pay almost another $200/night for an ""ocean view"", because we could see the ocean from our room beyond the pool, and the the upper rooms don't have the rock showers, which we thought just made the experience all the more ""tropical"".  All the restaurants were amazing and each is worth trying, but I must say my favorite was Alan Wong's Hualalai Grill, and we only did it for lunch 2 times. We especially loved the Beach BBQ under the stars on Saturday night. Sitting on the beach, talking with other guests and eating everything from sushi to steak to lobster, we thoroughly enjoyed it. They even had a telescope set up enabling you to view Saturn. What a great touch. The breakfast buffett was excellent as well, but we didn't feel like spending $70 a day on breakfast each morning so were happy heading over to the little cafe by the Trading Company for coffee, fruit, and pastries.  I got a facial at the spa and it was given outside. Heavenly.  One tip; If you need to fill up your rental car with gas before you return it, there is a pump in front of the Trading Company. We were so glad we didn't have to drive all the way back into Kona to do so before heading to the airport.  I really can't say more good things about Hualalai. It was a wonderful end to our week long trip and we may now be spoiled for a lifetime.

7490015,50,Still Love It ...,"We love this hotel and even though we usually stay in a house in another resort for the first week we always add a few days at this hotel to top off our trip. There have been a few changes since last year however that cause some concern. First of all, they now charge for valet parking - it was always complimentary - please, just build it into the room price like everything else there. The overall impression of not being ""nickeled and dimed"" as soon as you pull up is much better than making the decision to park yourself or pay for valet.    No more S'mores on the beach! That was one of those charming little extras that my son (and husband) just loved - we definitely missed those little treats!    The quiet pool is where the elite like to hang out and there's a butt on every lounge chair beginning very early in the morning - it's not the hotel's fault but the clientele is becoming more competitive. This ""forced"" us out to a beach lounge under the beach tree and it turned out to be a blessing in disguise - it was lovely out there with the breeze and the surf. I never noticed before that there's absolutely no breeze at the quiet pool. The service isn't quite as attentive as at the pools but we were happy as could be. We also enjoyed sitting on the beach adjacent to the snorkeling pond - we liked that it was quiet but the service is non-existant even though there's an attendants' station 30 feet away.    The spa and fitness center also seemed extremely busy with the local residents sort of taking over and socializing in loud groups. This will become a bigger problem as this resort development continues to grow. The spa is still my favorite in Hawaii.    Our only truly negative experience on this trip was very poor service and treatment by management at Alan Wong's. This again is not the hotel's fault as that restaurant is operated by Hualalai. It's too bad because the food is delicious. However it's also extremely noisy with poor acoustics and wild kids, plus there's no view. The menu also didn't change from a year ago and because we've eaten there many times, we were a little bored with the offerings. We will never go back to that restaurant. Pa'uia is actually much better anyway and the setting is so gorgeous. Yes, it is even more expensive than Alan Wong's but worth every penny - spectacular!    A few positive changes we noticed: plasma TV's in the rooms, mini smoothies on the breakfast buffet, the cocktails have improved!

We made the mistake of having dinner one night at the Fairmont and it was horrible. Tacky atmosphere and bad food.    The pools were beautiful and the poolside service was great.

7246900,50,A Slice of Heaven,"I had been so excited about going to Hawaii, and particularly about my stay at the Four Seasons Hualalai .... it was heavenly.    We started off our vacation in Maui and stayed at the Renaissance Wailea and then headed to Kona on an Island Air inter-island flight (note to all - Island Air operates turboprops while the bigger airlines offer jets.)    When we pulled into the resort I was stunned at the lush beauty of the grounds set in the midst of the lava rock terrain. The service was top notch from the valet & bellmen to the hostess at the front desk.    We had an oceanview villa, top floor, with a lovely view of the ocean and the childrens pool area. The villa was perfect, decorated in a tropical rustic elegance. The entry area is large with a large walk-in closet stocked with umbrella, beach bag, robes, slippers,etc. The bed, living area and balcony are on one side of the entry area and then the large bathroom is on the other side. What I loved was the large window in the bathroom area that I could open while the patio doors were open, the cross breeze was heavenly.    During the days I enjoyed laying out at the quiet pool (the main pool area for adults.) You would just walk near the chaises you wished to occupy and an attendant would be right over with cushion covers, towels and ice water. They would come around often with Evian spritzes, refreshing sorbets, cool wet mint clothes to cool down with and a sunglass cleaning service. The pool was beautiful and the chairs were soooo comfortable ....    We had almost every meal at the hotel (there for 6 days) and breakfasts & lunches got dull after day 2. Dinner at Alan Wongs Grill was delicious. Food extremely expensive and beware that service charges are added on to almost every bill you receive (at the restaurants.) We didn't notice that until day 3 (lots of money we could have saved if we had paid better attention.)    My husband and I enjoyed the Hualalai package at the Spa (facial, Lomi-Lomi massage and coconut body scrub.) It was divine ... totally worth the splurge. Fitness facilities superior with yoga & spinning classes offered daily.    One other thing to mention, there are complimentary laundry facilities located near all of the villas. Perfect when you are on a 10 day trip to Hawaii! I did laundry twice ...... vacation?    Anyway, if you can't tell already I absolutely loved it!

From the cold towels to the water spritzes you will truly enjoy the experience.    Last but not least, the spa is incredible. I know several people who search many resorts throughout the world for a spa like this one but they are still looking. I would definitely go for the outdoor Lomi Lomi massage.",Mar 2007,March 2007,Traveled as a couple,,"Chicago, IL"
7192751,50,The Absolute Best Place to Stay,"I saw this resort on the travel chanel and I thought to myself, ""I'd like to plan my next vacation there."" So, I did just that, and it was the most wonderful vacation I planned for my family. If you are coming to the Big Island, this is the absolute best resort on the island. The grounds are so beautiful. I love the Beach Tree Grill and dining on the beach while watching the sunset. Pure luxury yet, family friendly as well. I was surprised at the way this resort can accomodate a spectacular experience for both the ""honeymooners"" and families. I love how low key this place is, no crowds. The Bungalows are close to the ocean, you can go to sleep listening to the sound of the ocean. The rooms are beautiful and I love the outdoor lava rock shower. Everything about this place is amazing. I loved the store called ""Trading Company."" They have everything you need there. The restuarants are great. The hotel staff was warm and helpful, they treated my husband and my children like VIP's. We enjoyed the ""Snorkeling Pond"", the kids had a great time there. Loved going for walks on the beach and seeing the Turtles. I felt as if I was on private property living in paradise. It was a truly amazing experience and the best Four Seasons Hotel I've ever visited. I have another trip booked and I can't wait to go back. If you plan on visiting this resort, book and plan ahead, it sells out quickly. You won't be disappointed and you won't want to leave.",Mar 2007,August 2006,Traveled with family,,California
6753025,50,What a Fantastic Resort,"My wife and I have been to Hawaii every year for the last 10 years. This resort ranks right up there in terms of an overall experience. All staff member we encountered were friendly and courteous, but not over bearing or bothersome.    Our room was fantastic. We were able to whale watch from our lanai! House keeping was excellent, as was the laundry service. We had the Bed-and-Breakfast package, so breakfast right on the beach (Pahu i’a ) was simply fabulous. We also enjoyed a morning of room service that was fantastic as well. The sports club and spa was top notch. All equipment I used was in good working condition and we had an excellent couples massage.    We spent a lot of our time either on the beach or at the quite pool. Most people were respectful of the no cell phone rule, though there were the occasional “special people” who believe that rules don’t apply to them. The pool staff did an excellent job of handling these situations. The typical cooled towel, Evan mist, fruit kabob, and afternoon Otter Pops were always welcome.    The only two downsides have been mentioned by others is the isolation of the resort and the thinness of the walls. If you want to eat some where else, or do some shopping, you have spend 20-30 minutes (depending on traffic) going into Kailua-Kona, or Waikoloa.    Overall an outstanding experience that I would recommend.",Feb 2007,January 2007,Traveled as a couple,,"Parker, Colorado"
6748998,10,Underwhelmed and underimpressed,Just checked in and am shocked at the lack of proffesionalisim by the management and the front desk staff.    I am a frequent visitor to FS all over the world - almost to the point i drive my wife crazy about staying at one.    The hotel had me booked in what had to be the worst room in the hotel. I asked about upgrading to another room offering to pay what ever the difference in price. the clerk would go back and forth thru the door to talk to the manager but the manager would not face me directly! after waiting over an hour we decided to just get the room - for a property less than 6 years old the room smelled of smoke and mildew.    They are supposed to upgrade us tommorow i hope that room is better. overall would not revisit this property again!

6711939,30,Tired and Overpriced!,"Just stayed at the resort for four nights with my family.    My final feeling when I was leaving was service was not quite Four Season standard and the property was tired and needed some money spent on it.    Let me put down a few key points.    Service.    Greeting at the airport through to the bell desk and reception was friendly and efficient.    During the stay all the staff that worked the food areas, the pool and the golf course were great. However none of them seemd empowered to fix any issues that arose.    A watery cocktail was not replaced. Normal tea bags were a surcharge even though the flavoured Earl Grey tea was available FOC. That took 3 phone calls and a supervisor to fix. Weird we are talking about cents of cost compared to a eventual total bill of over $10,000 for the stay. We waited for Taxis for 20 minutes as the taxi waited for 20 minutes as no one bothered to follow through    There seems to be a lack of communication between various parts of the Hotel. If I liken it to some of the businesses I have been involved with, it comes down to dinstinct hand off management from the top.    We couldnt get into more than one of the 3 restaurants as they were always booked out. There really needed to be included in the high suite price, for a butler/personal concierge. I think Asian Luxury Hotels do it much better.    The buildings were definately showing age. the front stairs of our suite were dirty and worn. My side of the King bed sloped on one side. the light fittings were mostly incandescent old tech.    There were some positives. The golf course was fabulous. the front Lobby was nice Most of the staff were very pleasant.    However $ for $, this hotel does not compete. It is a very expensive place to stay, and for that you should expect world class delivery.",Jan 2007,January 2007,Traveled with family,,Paradise
6711486,50,Nothing like it,"This is the best hotel I've ever stayed at. Ever.    We flew into Kona airport. The hotel had sent a doorman to the airport to help us. He pointed us in the direction of baggage claim, and then tagged our bags, and hailed a taxi to take us to the hotel, which was a short drive away. The area is very interesting, all lava rock and not like the ""lush"" expectations we had for Hawaii. Beautiful, none the less.    We checked in the early morning before our room was ready. They gave us a house cell phone and said that they'd call us on it when the room was ready. This is pure efficiancy. We went to the breakfast restaurant and ate at the buffet, which had a staggering variety of food including cooked-to-order omelets, etc. We had a long leisurely breakfast, but our room was still not ready (this is what happens when a travel agent books you on an overnight red-eye arriving in the AM). We could've gone down the pool area, but we were so tired (and full from breakfast) that we sat in their beautiful lobby area and enjoyed the ocean breezes. Someone came by and offered us bottled water. We looked at one of the artists who had set up a little outdoor display downstairs from the main lobby area. And they have an old house car that parks near the entrance, I wasn't sure what it was used for.    Then the cell phone rang, and we went back to the front desk to go to our room. They brought us out to our room, with our luggage, in a golf cart! The property is very large, so this saves time walking (and obviously work for the bellmen). The bellman told us about the room and then let us enjoy it. It was furnished unlike any other hotel room I've visited. It had an entryway/ foyer like an apartment would. The bathroom was on the right and had a very large shower and tub, with a separated toilet. The vanity area was very large with sinks for two people with L'Occitane toiletries. They included bathrobes - a traditional white hotel robe, and a lightweight kimono-print. The closet contained a coffee maker, luggage stands, a safe, etc. The furnishings of the room were tasteful and very, very luxurious. We had a balcony with chairs that converted to loungers. There was a very big flat panel TV in the room, and DVDs that could be checked out from the front desk. We were happy to have an upstairs room because it afforded more privacy from passers by.    Once we settled into the room, we changed clothes and went down to the beach and pool area. The hotel has several pools and hot tubs scattered throughout the resort, and several of them are for adults only, which we appreciated. We had lunch at the Beach Grill. One of us liked the menu, the other had trouble finding something to enjoy. We sat at the beach the rest of the day. The beach staff put out towels for us, and we asked for more but she never came back... oh well. They have a system where they give you a wooden disk, and you turn it over if you'd like to order beverages or snacks. The beach is protected by a breakwall, but there wasn't snorkelling in it. There was nearby Kings Pond for that. The pool was one of those infinity edges and had a built in hot tub right in it. There were showers nearby to keep from getting sand in the pool.    For dinner at Pahuia the seafood was fantastic. Fresh, delicious, filling... we were stuffed! We went back two more nights during our stay. We preferred it to the Alan Wong restaurant. One day we ordered a late lunch from the Beach Grill and we didn't need to eat dinner. It saves some money because those poolside cocktails add up fast.    Housekeeping staff was very pleasant; everyone greeted us as we passed by. They have a game room that looks like it'd be for teenagers. The spa gave us wonderful massages. There was a glitch in our billing at check out. It said that we ate at the Alan Wong restaurant twice, but we didn't. When we told the front desk that, they took it right off the bill.    Wonderful stay, put a dent in the wallet, but we'd love to go back.",Jan 2007,September 2006,Traveled as a couple,,USA

Had the most amazing time. Staff was friendly and not over the top like you would expect at a Ritz Carlton or the like (they didn't say hello Mr. Smith everytime they saw you). Food was great. We both are looking forward to coming back next year. Great place to really relax. The spa was indeed the best in the U.S. Rebound Ace tennis courts were nice too. We highly recommend staying here.

6596150,50,wonderful honeymoon spot!,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for the last 3 nights of our honeymoon in Hawaii. We wish we had stayed longer! The hotel is beautifully arranged, spread out along the beach in 2-story bungalows. It felt very private and luxurious despite it being pretty full with guests. We had an ocean view room with a gorgeous view of the ocean and the man-made snorkeling lagoon. The main pool area was lovely with a beach bar (literally on the beach!) and casual restaurant where we had lunch. The pool itself and hot tub were both infinity style and very relaxing. We only spent one full day lounging at the hotel as we had to check out the Big Island (amazing destination; the incredibly volcanic island is unique in appearance and vibe among all the Hawaiian islands) but it was wonderful. We loved Alan Wong's restaurant, Hualalai Grill, and rushed back from Volcano National Park to make it in time for dinner for our second night in a row! The heirloom tomato soup was absolutely delicious and addicting! The tuna chili nachos at the golf clubhouse were amazing and it really is tuna though it tasted just like beef (I was almost willing to renounce my vegetarianism)! The staff were friendly and accomodating. Our favorite part was our couples massage which we enjoyed in an outdoor tent at the spa. We also enjoyed the cold dip and hot tub and saunas in the spa. We can't wait to go back, either to celebrate an anniversary or with family (it's a family friendly resort as well as an extremely romantic one)!",Jan 2007,August 2005,Traveled as a couple,,"New York City, New York"
6565930,50,Heaven on earth,"After staying at the Four Seasons in Maui which was ok, (you could read my review there); I was amazed by the property...this is what Hawaii is all about!! The lobby was gorgeous, just as you see on their website...reminded me of a Buddhist temple..all the buildings are made from wood to give it a rustic, yet very elegant look...we had a room with the outdoor shower which is definately a must!! The quiet pool was beautiful, but since were in Hawaii, I'd rather be at the beach. The beach itself is very rocky but there is a small area where you can swim; the hotel offers water shoes which I suggest so that you don't step on a seaurchent or rock...the pond where you can snorkel with Eagle Ray's (totally safe) is amazing....there are turtles everywhere resting and I even saw one in the ocean and snorkeled alongside it!! The best restaurant was the Alan Wong....Beachtree Grill is great for lunch....it is all very expensive, but who cares, your on vacation!! Definately rent a car and check out Waipio Valley...it's beautiful and you can book horseback riding there....also, we took a helicopter tour over the volcano and saw lava and steam coming out of the craters....truly an amazing experience, well worth the money!!!! Definatley book the ""Sunlight on Water Tour"" to swim with the spinner dolphins in the wild...that's right, you find the dolphins, get in the water and snorkel with them...at one point I was in the middle of a pod and was swimming within arms reach from them... breathtaking!! Everything about this property and this island was amazing....each island is very different from one another....when you arrive in Kona, you feel like you landed on the moon because of all the lava rock everywhere!! Its so different than Maui; that's why I suggest splitting up the trip so you get a taste of the difference in these amazing islands. Also, the rooms at this property were SOOOO much nicer than the Four Seasons in Maui (I know they are renovating so they will probably be nicer soon); but this property is Hawaii in every sense. There really was no spa at the Four Seasons Maui, just a steam room and massage rooms; this property is ranked as one of the top spas in the world....its like the garden of eden...steam, sauna, hot pool, cold plunge pool; and you receive your services in these cute little huts....they have a lap pool and a ton of classes and activities to choose from; I would definately have spent more days here vs. Maui",Jan 2007,December 2006,Traveled as a couple,,"Chicago, IL"
6556953,50,"Spectacular, spectacular","I think most reviews of this hotel are bang on:    The Good:  - Great rooms, great service, great food  - The resort is very large so there is no need to leave and you'll never feel crowded  - Meticulously manicured grounds, and I mean all 30 odd acres of it  - This Four Seasons has redefined what you can do with a beach buffet - at $78 pp I was a bit skeptical, but booked the next weekend buffet without hesitation    The things that make me wonder - these are not necessarily bads, but gee....  - Almost all drinks are $12 and up, so having a few can rack up very quickly (I guess this is just a pet peeve)  - Alan Wong's serves wonderful food, but boy is it dark inside, I could barely see what I was eating  - It's not the most social resort I've been to, but I wanted seclusion and quiet and I got it  - Expect to spend at least $1,000 / day. If this is not your snack bracket don't bother going, as the charges above and beyond your room rate rack up very quickly once you arrive    Standouts for me personally:  - Taking the walking / jogging paths - wonderful (and a good jog if you do the entire route)  - Sitting outside on the patio with a bottle of wine as the sun sets  - Sitting around the adults only pool with no one else around  - Breakfast buffet - the food was good, but the ambiance of eating breakfast a few feet from the sea was even better  - The spa / health club is second to none I've been to    So there you go, glowing recommendations from almost all of us who have visited the FS Hualalai.

6526888,40,No reason to leave,"My husband and I are loyal Four Seasons fans. We travel extensively for business and pleasure and sometimes select a vacation destination specifically for its Four Seasons. We have enjoyed Hawaii previously (Mauna Lani, Ritz Carlton Maui, Manele Bay and Lodge at Koele, Princeville), but November marked our first visit to the Four Seasons Hualalai, a three-night stay at the end of a family Thanksgiving vacation (please see our related posting about the Hapuna Beach Prince). Overall, the experience was excellent, offering the perfect mix of relaxation and activities with no reason to leave the beautiful resort. We agree with the dozens of positive postings on this site about the accomodations, spa/gym, pools (snorkeling with manta rays is really fun) and excellent breakfast buffet. A few favorites to add:  1) The sand and stars BBQ on the beach on Saturday  2) Early morning and sunset walk or run along the oceanfront -- one of the most beautiful jogging paths in the world  3) Dinner at Alan Wong's  4) Awesome, uncrowded golf course  5) As many days as possible sitting by the quiet pool reading a good book    I must note, however, that the service at Hualalai did not compare favorably to other FS properties (unlike the Hapuna Prince which exceeded our expectations). We are low maintenance guests and encountered no significant issues (in fact, the housekeeping and spa attendants were outstanding), but we found that the service lacked the attentiveness (at the pool and at check-in) and lacked the genuine smiles we have come to expect as the standard return on the large investment in a Four Seasons vacation.

6490797,50,Absolutely Wonderful!,"We stayed at the Four Seasons Hualalai for 5 days for our wedding/honeymoon. Everything about the property was soo much better than we expected. There's a greeter at the airport that somehow knew who we were when we arrived. She greeted us by name, took care of our bags, got a taxi for us and even booked our rental car all within the time it takes to get your luggage from baggage claim.  Upon arrival at the resort, the front desk greeted us with lei's and tropical fruit drink. They upgraded our room to an ocen view but we really wanted a downstairs room because of the outdoor lava shower. It wasn't a problem, and because we had to wait for the room to be ready they paid for our lunch at the Beachfront grille. Our room was beautiful, situated by the adult's only pool. They even had a bottle of champagne and chocolates waiting for us in our room.  I would recommend going with the bed and breakfast package. It's an $80 credit towards breakfast you can use for in-room dining (which we took advantage of 4/5 days we were there) or you can use at Pahuia restaurant for their breakfast buffet.  The food was great, expensive but worth it. I wasn't too impressed with the service or food at Alan Wong's. However the food at Pahuia was excellent. The appetizers at the bar upstairs are great too (mini ahi pizzas! yum!).  There isn't much of a beach to swim in which was fine for us. It's tough to go in the water without reef walking shoes which they provide by the pool complimentary. At the pool they'll spritz you with water, bring you drinks, food anything you want. The service is extraordinary.  For snorkeling the King's Pond was awesome. This is also complimentary. The pond has tons of fish in it. The water is very cold and it's about 25-30 feet deep. We never saw too many people at the pond which is why we liked it so much.  Spa services are awesome. We had an outdoor couple's massage which we thoroughly enjoyed. They're not cheap but well worth it. You can use their facilities while there, spa, jacuzzi, outdoor excersise machines, lap pool, cold dip. If you have a late departing flight you can use their spa for as long as you like.  Concierge is a great resource. Use them to book your activities. We had a nice helicopter tour of the island with Blue Hawaiian on our last day. It was spectacular!  Everything about the property is beyond perfection. You don't need to travel outside of the resort for anything and you shouldn't because nothing else will really compare. When we had our car rental we went down to the King's Shops (high end shopping) but it was nothing great. We went in the opposite direction towards downtown/pier to get our marriage licensse and we found it crowded and dirty and somewhat of a teenage hangout. Stay in the resort as much as possible.

6161499,50,Incredible,"We decided to splurge our last two nights on the Big Island and finally stay at a Four Seasons. It was worth every penny. The place is incredible. The room (overlooking the golf course and the ocean beyond) was luxurious. Heard no noise from the adjoining rooms. We asked for a first floor room to get an outdoor shower and were glad we did. Note that there is an indoor shower stall also in case you don't want to use the outdoor one after dark.  The staff was beyond excellent. Someone was always available to fulfil your request. Ice cold washcloths at the pool, bottles of water at the gym, top-notch service in the restaurants. The list goes on with the little extras they do for you.  All three restaurants were incredible. A beachfront table on the deck at Pahuia, the tasting menu at Hualalai Grill, the surf & turf BBQ on the beach on Saturday night. None of them should be missed.

6158286,30,Sophisticated Elegance,"My husband and I stayed at the Four Seasons Hualalai for the second half (honeymoon) of our Hawaii destination wedding vacation, from 11/13--11/16. For three days before that, we had stayed at Halekulani in Honolulu (see my other review-- I gave Halekulani 5 stars).    I chose this hotel because of the glowing reviews all over the internet. And it is, no doubt, a fantastic place, with the decor being very sophisticated and elegant (Of course! It's the Four Seasons).    THE GOOD    We had a long and drawn out check in story (see below), but the wonderful thing is that we were upgraded from an Ocean View room to an Ocean Front Executive Suite in the Seashell Pool area! The rooms at this resort are built in crescents around their five pools, and the Ocean Front rooms at at the ends of the crescents. Based on other reviews, I had worried that the Seashell area would be too full of children, but at this time of year it was very quiet... no problem at all. The view from our room was utterly breathtaking at all times of day... even in the evening when a spotlight was directed from shore on the foam of the waves coming in.    This is a place to relax-- with five pools and the famous Four Seasons poolside service (although I did not spend enough time lounging at the pool to receive any fruit or evian spritzes), etc... This hotel, compared with other Four Seasons properties, is more like a little village because all of the rooms are like bungalows with their own private entrance, and the walkways between the bungalows are lit up by tiki torches at night. The rooms also have screens so one can hear the waves crashing in all night long. Combine this with peering at the stars through palm fronds in the crystal clear Hawaii-Island skies.. If you are into seclusion, this is your place. We also really appreciated the free washers and dryers right outside the room! My husband left his dried clothes unfolded on the chair, and housekeeping actually folded them!    Yes, there are fantastic amenities in the rooms. They were a combination of Hawaiian elements and other quality international brands (such as L'Occitane shampoos, bath oils, etc...). An example of the Hawaiian influence was a woven bag provided for use during one's stay (this helped when going to the pool or down to the beach). As a matter of fact, there was a price list in the room for all of the amenities, in case the guests would like to buy their own from the hotel store before leaving (ranging from the yukatta robes to the soap dishes to the reading light beside the bed).    Other reviewers mentioned that the rooms are not as soundproofed as they could be, but there was only one occasion when this became an issue for my husband and I (for about 1 hour during the day when our next door neighbors were watching TV rather loudly). Other than this, we were completely fine. This could have a lot to do with the fact that 1)We were on the second floor (no chance of noise from above), 2)We were there during the off-season, and 3)We had an ocean front room, with only one other room beside us, and I'm sure there was no one staying there at the time.    As some of the other reviewers say, it is true that there is not a big swimming beach. There is a small area that is closed off by a wall that blocks the waves, and this was more than adequate for my husband and I to frolic in-- not to mention crystal blue. Just walking around the resort (or any beach on the island) and looking at the ocean is a very dynamic scene-- with black lava rock jutting out and the ocean spray from the waves... If you like more of a beach, try the Mauna Lani Bay Hotel. They also have a walled in area with no waves, but their beach is wider and you can lie under the palm trees in a hammock (We did it for a few hours on our last evening on the Big Island).    SO WHY THE THREE STAR RATING?!    We did not find the Four Seasons Hualalai to be ""cozy"" in any way. Maybe that is not what one is necessarily looking for at this kind of place, but our room rather felt to us like our our personal Starbucks (same color scheme), or the VIP room at the American Pavillion at the Worlds Fair. This is coming from our own personal preferences, though. In addition, compared to our stay at Halekulani, both my husband and I did not feel the same kind of personable friendliness emminating from the staff. Here are some unfortunate things that happened:    We arrived at the hotel at about 11:30am, only to be told that our room was not ready yet. We were given a cell phone to be called when we could approach the front desk again for our key, etc... (Someone takes you to your room in a golf cart). They suggested we get some lunch, so my husband and I headed down to the beachtree cafe, where we could literally put our toes right in the sand while eating sandwiches and drinking cocktails (for about $70.00, but that was OK). Here is the important point-- They told us that we could leave any of our bags at the desk and have our arms free until our room was ready, but having just come from our wedding and carrying my **very expensive**>< wedding dress, this and some other items were things we just didn't want to hand over... so we carried them. The very nice waitress at the cafe told us that some people do not get checked in until 3pm, and that's what happened to us. We ended up sitting in the lobby with our valuables and snoozing on the sofa-- Not good form, I know, but what could we do?...    The next morning, I woke up bright and early and decided to sit in a cabana at the pool. I was the first one there, and the nice woman there helped me to set up the chair with towels, etc... I have no idea why, but soon afterwards a wheelbarrow (labeled ""Rubbermaid"" with dirty empty plastic boxes inside was parked right by my cabana, in the direction of the ocean. This just seemed a detail overlooked, as I was the only one at the whole pool -- And this wasn't a towel cart, mind you. I don't know what it was for, but I saw some other ones around the property later on. Anyway, I tried to ignore it, but I gotta admit.. It was kinda blocking my view, so I said very nicely when the woman came around, ""Is it OK I move this?"". She looked surprised-- and even hurt-- and said, ""I'll do it."" I felt guilty for asking!    While some of the front desk and concierge workers were extremely nice, others were not. In particular, one young woman really seemed to stick out from the others. She was loud and opinionated, and it even sounded like she was talking on a personal call at one point-- I know she wasn't, but she was giving that impression. Granted, she did help us at one point, but she did not exude a professional atmosphere at all.    One day, my husband and I rented a convertible and had lost our suntan lotion at the beach. As my skin is extremely sensitive to the sun, I asked the Concierge if they had any special bottles, and a call was made to get one. I said, ""Should I wait here for it?"" and she said, ""No, the valets will put it in the car"". Well, we got halfway down the road when we noticed it had not been brought. We never heard another word about it. Had it been Halekulani, they would have placed it in the room so we could get it afterwards.    There were a few other things like this, but this review is too long already. However, I was obviously not imagining these things.    In the end, it was a very nice hotel, but not fabulous by our standards because of the service issues mentioned above. So, perhaps it doesn't seem fair to give three stars to a hotel that assigned us one of their best suites, but please remember that this is a subjective review! We're glad to have stayed here, and didn't mind the splurge, but we won't do it again.",Nov 2006,November 2006,Traveled as a couple,,Japan
6146145,50,Absolutely Amazing!,"We just returned from our first (but not last) trip to Kona and the Four Seasons Hualalai. Previously, we stayed at Manele Bay (5 times) prior to it becoming a Four Seasons Resort. It was our favorite place - until now. My sister and brother-in-law have stayed at Hualalai several times and convinced us to try it. I can't say enough good things about this place, therefore, I will just try and highlight some of our favorites so I don't run out of room.    The room was great. It was a Prime Ocean View that was steps from the ocean, although I don't think you could go wrong with any of the rooms. The food, terrific. We especially liked the Hualalai Grille (Alan Wongs) at the Golf Club. My husband has been to the King Street location on Oahu many times when he travels on business, and the Grille did not disappoint. The grounds are beautiful. There is a path running right along the ocean that is perfect for strolling or, if you are a little more ambitious, jogging. There are 2 adult pools, a kids pool, a snorkeling pond stocked full of fish, and a lap pool at the sports club. There is also a lagoon right in front of the resort that is separated from the ocean by a lava rock formation. We spent most of our time there. The only thing you have to be careful of is not to step on the rocks as there are sea urchins attached. One poor girl did just that, and her foot was a mess. The key is to just swim around and once you see the sand, you are a-ok to put your feet down. The resort staff is extremely accommodating and it's apparent that they really like their jobs.    The resort is expensive, but well worth every penny. It was extremely relaxing, invigorating, and romantic. We are already in the planning stages for our next trip.",Nov 2006,November 2006,Traveled as a couple,,"San Diego, CA"
6015521,50,Perhaps one of the BEST Four Seasons Properties,"To begin, the Four Seasons Hualalai, is the finest resort you could possibly select on all of the Hawaiian islands. As an avid traveler, and loyal Four Seasons guest, the property exceeded my expectations in every regard.  I consider this a wonderful option for a wide variety of travelers including, couples, honeymooners and families.    The location:  Situated on the Kona Coast of the Big Island of Hawaii, this resort offers one of the islands most private locations. That being said, the Four Seasons is only a ten minute drive from the airport, which adds a measure of convenience.  This resort is nestled in the historic Hualalai resort community, which is an upscale resort inclusive of condominiums, homes and a world renowned golf course. The moment you drive in, you know you're in for something special.  If you're looking for amazing grounds, and utmost privacy, this is your resort.    The rooms:  Unlike most traditional resorts, the Four Seasons is comprised of several bungalow style buildings, which each house around 6-8 individual rooms. Two important options to note: If you're on the upper floors, the rooms tend to benefit from better views, and if you're on the lower floors, the rooms offer an outdoor lava rock shower (which some people rave over) I personally prefer the upper rooms, as they do offer much better views and slightly higher ceilings. Try to avoid rooms near the main pool area, as it tends to get rather noisy at times.  Rooms offer all of the traditional amenities you might expect from a Four Seasons, plus 42"" Plasma TV's, walk-in showers, separate tub, slate flooring, and large lanai's.    The service:  Service is excellent, and in line with other Four Seasons properties. One thing to note however, is that ""Hawaii Time"" is a bit slower than usual, but don't interpret this as bad service. The staff just might not jump as quickly as they would in a larger city, or even as they would at the Maui Four Seasons.    The restaurants:  Food and beverage was excellent, as expected. There are several dining options, including Alan Wong's(fine dining), the Beachtree Cafe (casual) and one other Fine dining option. Surprisingly, out of the all the restaurants available, I was most impressed by the Residents Restaurant (which is intended to serve the permanent residents of Hualalai) They will however accept some reservations by Four Seasons guests. This is a great place for lunch.  Breakfast was also good, but not quite as impressive as the spread offered at the Four Seasons Maui.  Also, be sure to check out the resort's general store. It's the cutest hotel gift shop/gas station I've ever seen!    In summary, the Four Seasons Hualalai, is perhaps the best hotel option in the Hawaiian Islands. This is not a place for the budget conscious, but certainly well worth the money spent.  Rooms, dining, and activities are all expensive, but all make for an amazingly memorable vacation.    If you're trying to make a decision between the Four Seasons Maui and Hualalai, expect a world of differences. Hualalai offers a much more authentic Hawaiian experience, with a more tranquil environment. Although still a nice property, the Maui FS tends to be more commercial, with less opportunity for relaxation.",Oct 2006,September 2006,Traveled with family,,"Los Angeles, California"
6011842,50,A few things to consider....,The following is our opinion of what is very right--and what is a little not so right--about this property:    VERY RIGHT: beautiful setting; excellent landscaping; privacy; large rooms; large flat panel tvs; slate bathroom and lanai; padded teak furniture on patio/lanai; food; Lava Lounge for evening cocktails; tennis courts; golf course; coffee place; spa; friendliness of staff; service; free washer/dryer/detergent; bath amenities; large walk-in closet    NOT SO RIGHT: saggy bed in two-bed room; sheets not as nice as Fairmont Kea Lani (i.e. sheet thread count should be at least half of what you're paying as a nightly rate :); cost (we know it's the 4S.......it's just soooooo expensive for a good ocean view--we paid almost $1k per night for an ocean view prime that was not a suite); path lighting at night (very difficult to see where you're going),Oct 2006,October 2006,,,
5985402,50,Tremendous - even during the earthquake,"We were staying at another resort on the big island the day the 6.7 magnitude earthquake rattled the island. We had planned to check out and move on to the Four Seasons that day. When the earthquake hit we weren't sure what was going to happen that day. The other resort we were staying at had a few problems and fortunately everyone was okay. We were able to checkout and get out of there. We called the Four Seasons at 10:30am and asked how they were doing. They said everything was fine - and to come on over. We weren't expecting to be able to get into our room, but we figured we'd get there a bit early and enjoy the day if we could despite what was happening. The island was without power most of the day, but you have to give the people of Hawaii credit for staying so calm and collected.    We got to the Four Seasons and they welcomed us despite getting there pretty early. They told us to enjoy the grounds and that our room probably wouldn't be ready until 3pm. They took our cell phone number and said they would call when it was ready (they called at 1:20pm saying it was ready). We checked out the wonderful pools and grounds and found that their main restaurant was serving a complimentary lunch due to the earthquake. They fired up the BBQ since the power was out and served up some lobster tail, burgers and other fine dishes. They made us feel so comfortable on a day when everyone was trying to find calm and feel safe after the earthquake.    I can't say enough about the service at this place. You definitely pay a lot for the stay, but the service makes up for a lot of that. They take care of just about any request you can think of. We asked about dinner reservations and they left messages at our room offering us reservation options at different times. We needed to get a prescription filled due to a mishap and they made it happen extremely quickly despite what was going on with the earthquake.    Evening dining options are basically the Pahui‘a or the Hualalai Grill. The Hualalai Grill is not operated by the Four Seasons, but is an Alan Wong restaurant. We found it to be pretty nice, but not as fantastic as the Pahui'a. The service at the Hualalai grille was okay, not great, and the food was pretty good but the atmosphere was pretty noisy and didn't have great views or anything like the Pahui‘a. The Pahui‘a sits right on the beach and not only is the food outstanding, but so is the service.    We had a couples massage at the spa and it was above average. Not anything out of this world. We felt a little rushed. However, the rest of the spa and facilities are incredible. You name it - they've got it. We used the cardio and fitness facilities and were quite pleased.    We took advantage of the DVD collection and watched a movie in our room. The huge Phillips plasma TVs are really great.    For the price you pay, I would have expected Internet services to be complimentary, but they were not. It was an extra fee through Wayport. Disappointing.",Oct 2006,September 2006,Traveled as a couple,,"Singapore, Singapore"
5931545,50,"Four Seasons as always, the greatest","We stayed recently for a week at the Four Seasons on the Big Island. The room was spectacular we were in front of the Kings Pond on the lower floor. We had the outdoor shower we really enjoyed. The food was awesome all of the restaurants were great, never had a bad meal at any of them. We did the Saturday night sand, stars buffet on the beach it was excellent. The golf course had the fairways punched so the golf was not great but I knew this before I went. The price is extemely high on everything. I knew this too, number one you are in Hawaii and number two you are at the Four Seasons, so expect to pay. I never mind paying for good service and we definitely got it. We left the resort once and I could not wait to get back. All of the amenities were excellent the spa, the pool, the service. The beach is basically non-existant so if you want a great beach vacation, I wouldnt suggest it. But we could care less about swimming in the ocean. I would go back tomorrow if I could.",Oct 2006,September 2006,Traveled as a couple,,"Germantown, Tennessee"

Some tips-- we were told to book a ground floor room because of the outside shower. We were not blown away and instead would have preferred and upstairs room with a view-- but I guess this is all personal preference. The rooms are really beautiful and this place is totally laid back. I can't recommend it enough! The service isn't up to par with the Four Seasons Maui, but it is still very good.

5814598,50,"Heaven on Big Island, HI","I am convinced this is the best luxury hotel experience on Big Island, by far. My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights/days in early July. An absolutely spectacular property with equally wonderful service, luxuries and ameneties (as one should expect from FS). If you are a FS fan, you know exactly what it means to stay at one of their properties, but the Hualalai is top tier even for Four Seasons. Perhaps it is the quiet location on a relatively quiet part of the Island, the stunning beach, the world class features or overall the well-planned property with everything you need to be completely self sufficient in paradise for a few days---even down to its own grocery store and gas station! This is truly an amazing property and I would return in a hearbeat. Here are some details--The quiet pool was a wonderful destination to lounge, sun and relax in the afternoons. Only one of several pools on the resort, this was by far my favorite, but you also have the man-made snorkeling pool and the family friendly pool if you so desire. Service was always attentive and quick anywhere in the public facilities, but it was definitely nice getting my Evian spritz, fruit and my Hualalai lemonade served at to me at my lounger in the quiet pool. All restaurants were fabulous, and particularly the Allan Wong restaurant near the golf course had both delicious, creative, world-class level cuisine and of course the attentive service of the FS caliber. We also loved the Lava Lounge atop Pahuia at night for ""late-night"" cocktails and lounge entertainment, for those of us who stay up later than 9:30 PM. You cannot usually go wrong with a Four Seasons room, but this one in particular, with its slate floors, large roomy slate baths, dark wood accents, comfy bed & bedding, and my husband's favorite--flat screen TVs--were extra luxurious. We had a top floor and no outdoor shower, regrettably, but what we did have was a fabulous lanai with a great oceanfront view and a wonderful place to take in the beautiful Hawaiian sunsets in the evenings--not to mention breakfast in the morning, a little laptop/email checking in the afternoon and cocktails at night! I had two great treatments in the fabulous spa and my husband very much enjoyed his round of world class golf. We then had a couples massage in an open-air hut that was fantastic--both the treatment and the experience overall. Altogether a tremendous few days that went all too fast in an outstanding Four Seasons property. I would recommend Hualalai to anyone looking for the best experience on the Big Island.",Sep 2006,August 2006,Traveled as a couple,,"San Francisco, California"
5794091,50,Amazing!,"This resort is everything you have heard and more! I just returned from my 8 night honeymoon there and am already figuring out when I can return. I read all the reviews on this hotel and was not disappointed. Yes- it is pricey. But my husband and I went in knowing that and were not upset by the costs. Actually compared to other four seasons I have stayed at - it is was reasonable. For example- the pool menu prices were the same as the four seasons in Austin, TX where you have little atmosphere and almost no pool attendants. I was happy to pay those prices for the service we were getting. The outdoor shower is amazing- request it! As with anywhere you stay for 8 days- you will probably run into a snag or two- but the one or two times we did the problem was fixed immediately after we called. The Grill by Alan Wong is the best restaurant there in our opinion. Also- the lava lounge bar actually has a great menu (mini kobe beef burgers etc.) if you feel like doing a more casual adult setting one night. We had a rental convertible all 8 days and left the resort twice if that tells you anything.",Sep 2006,August 2006,Traveled as a couple,,"Houston, TX"
5706439,50,Beautiful resort!,"This is the most beautiful resort we've ever stayed at in Hawaii! Just breathtaking! My husband and I enjoyed every bit of our stay. The employees are top-notch, the resort offers everything you can ever imagine. The Pahi'a was just wonderful. The food was to die for. If you don't mind spending a bit more money for luxury, this is the place for you. The one review from California is the most ridiculous we have ever read. Upset b/c pillows were placed on the floor, somebody had ""alcohol"" on their breath during a massage and rubbed too hard, and having a restaurant give you three more entrees b/c you didn't like them? Please.....now that's a chronic complainer. You should have stayed home. I'm sure the employees just loved to have to deal with you for the week. Believe most of the other reviews.

5626738,50,Can't wait to go back!!,"My husband and I just returned from a 7 night stay at Hualala'i. We loved every minute of it! In all honesty, I am shocked to hear any complaints about this wonderful resort. We felt that the service was amazing from top to bottom. Every staff member was incredibly friendly and helpful. We were in a prime ocean view room and the view was spectacular. They are on the upper floor so you you do trade the outside shower for the view (and more privacy!), but that was okay with us. We were close to the ""child friendly"" pool which at times was a bit on the noisy side but if shut out slidding glass door you could not hear a thing. We tried all of the resturants and they were great. The only downside to this resort would have to be the cost. We paid close to $1000 a night but that did include a full buffet breakfast. All in all if this type of trip fits in your budget, this is a wonderful relaxing trip and I would highly recommend this resort.",Aug 2006,August 2006,Traveled as a couple,,San Francisco
5609268,40,Fair and Balanced Review!,"Just got back from 4 nights at Hualalai... here's the good and the not so good...    First, by way of disclosure, I don't play golf, but I'm told the course is excellent (not too tought, but beautiful shape).    The hotel is immaculately maintained and the service is (with one notable exception-- see below) impeccable, as you would expect from the 4 Seasons.    The room was wonderful.    In the summer, it's a big family destination with lots of kids, but there is an ""adult pool"" for those who want peace and quiet.    Kids eat free at most of the restaurants as long as mom/dad order a full price dinner-- that's a bonus.    Here's the bummer part about Hualai, however: the beach is awful. You are not allowed to swim in the ocean because of the dangerours reefs that line the man-made beach. They have made one small tidal pool area where you can swim, but it's hardly like going in the ocean, which is why I went to Hawaii! How do you build a hotel in Hawaii without figuring out a way for guests to go in the ocean?    Another bummer: the ""fine dining restaurant"" has a gazillion dollar view of the ocean, but the food is average at best and the staff is surly beyond belief. By contrast, Alan Wong's restaurant at the golf club is a must-hit.    All in, this is a great hotel, but the lack of a servicable beach is tough to overcome...",Aug 2006,July 2006,,,"Washington, DC"
5593545,20,Surprised at What Happened,"We stayed at the Four Seasons last year and thought it divine. We came back this year for our anniversary and were surprised by a number of problems. First of all, when we arrived, we had to wait approximately 21/2 hours after guaranteed check-in time to be allowed into our room because the air conditioner was broken. We asked to speak to the manager and she did comp us for one night, so we let it go. Once we got into our room, it was filthy. We asked them to please come and clean it and to replace the down comforter with a blanket. When they finally came to do it, the young man who was changing our bedding put all of our pillows on the floor and then back on to the bed again. I asked housekeeping if this was a common practice and if so, to please refrain from doing so. They apologized but we never saw a smiling face on any of them after that. One housekeeping employee confessed that there aren't too many people on the island available for hire, so their housekeeping staff was a bit low on employees. Plus I guess they were in the middle of training new ones. They never did get our room quite right. Oh well. The rooms were still beautiful and the landscaping was breathtaking. The pools were wonderful, too. Pahi'a, their main dining room was excellent. The room service, however, was horrible! The food was always overcooked and tasteless. We tried three times! Also, the food served at Alan Wong's was a hit or miss. Both times we ate there, we experienced a dish that was really bad. One of those times, the manager came over and offered a substitution, which took quite a while to bring (and there was almost no one in the restaurant). Then they charged us for everything and offered no compensation for the trouble. Last of all and most unfortunately, my husband and I had a couples massage which began for me, with a masseuse whom I believed to have alcohol on her breath, and ended with a really bad massage. She did some things that I asked her not to, then seemed to become angry when I asked her not to be so rough. I was in a lot of pain afterwards, so my usually easy-going husband insisted we say some thing. We spoke to the manager and she did remove the charge for my massage and then proceeded to try and sell me some spa products. Hmmm. Now, I must say that I have never had an experience like this at a Four Seasons. We paid about $876.00 a night for our room upstairs overlooking the Beach Tree pool. I am astonished that things are being run the way they are and that very few have noticed. This property's reputation is far too valuable to let these things happen. And yet, they did. I certainly will never return after this experience.",Aug 2006,July 2006,Traveled as a couple,,"Los Angeles, California"

5538603,50,One of the best,"We just returned from a wonderful 5 night stay for our honeymoon at the Hualalai. I read most of the reviews during the planning, and I want to return the favor. This hotel was fantastic. It was very crowded while we were here, but we hardly noticed. We could always get a chair at the main pool (a private cabana was harder to get if you show up at noon or later, but they can't have enough private canopy/cabanas for every guest). The service was fantastic. The ""Evian Spritzers"" and ""Otter Pops"" were nice, but the overall service at the pool was great. The service everywhere else was great too. The valets were courteous and remember your name. A couple also helped us out to find a neat local beach. The beach at the hotel seems to be mostly trucked-in sand. I was able to get out and snorkel, but the hotel doesn't recommend this as it is difficult to navigate the rocks/coral to get past the breakers. Our room was fantastic. There is a small garage type building behind each set of rooms with ice and a courtesy washer dryer, which we found exceptionally convenient. We had a first floor room with the rockwall outdoor shower. I would highly recommend asking for this. Other reviewers have noted that the walls were thin. We didn't experience any of this, although they are constantly trimming, cultivating, sweeping the grounds, etc. This didn't bother us in the least (no gas blowers or weedeaters, etc.). We also stayed by the quiet pool which was nice, however the main pool seemed to be awfully quiet while we were there. There are a couple of pools just set up for families and kids, and most of the kids stayed there. I thought the prices were pretty normal for a nice 5 Star hotel. Its expensive, but you're at the 4 Seasons in Hawaii. The drinks are a little over the top, so we went into town to purchase a few of our favorite drinks and mixers so we didn't have to spend $14 every time we wanted a drink (domestic beers are $7!). We made our own drinks and watched the sunset from our wonderful patio (I saw other guests doing this as well) The entrees seemed to run around $25-$40 at the restaurants, and they seemed to be on par with what you'd expect at a nice restaurant anywhere. Its also close enough to go into Kona for an afternoon to shop and eat (we did this twice). Although, I wouldn't get your hopes up. Kona is neat to see, but it looks like any other beachtown/cruise ship destination. Tshirt shops, Hard Rock, etc. We did find a great little sushi place, and its a great way to save a couple bucks and have a more moderately priced meal.    The Hualalai was well worth it, and we'll probably go back. The service was great and on par with some of the best hotels in the world. Other reviewers have nitpicked about small problems. No hotel is perfect, and we had a couple of small problems, but nothing to take away from our stay. Plus its hard to please everyone, especially when everyone is expecting perfection.",Jul 2006,,,,"Charleston, SC"
5529936,50,Perfect!,"I could not have envisioned a more perfect island retreat than what we found when we stayed at the Four Seasons Hualalai. The resort somehow embraced it's natural location by the sea and made you feel one with nature. It managed to maintain a remote, rustic feel yet envelope you in luxury. The rooms were beautiful, the outdoor shower was unforgettable. I loved how the restaurants were situated right on the beach. Sea turtles everywhere. I could go on and on but I won't. I did not have one complaint. One warning, if you stay anywhere else on the Islands after the Four Seasons, you will be disappointed! If you are Island hopping, make this your last stop, otherwise the other resorts will pale in comparison.",Jul 2006,June 2006,Traveled with family,,Atlanta
5505688,50,it's all about the outdoor rock shower,"We stayed here for 4 nights in June. Upon arrival we were greeted by the parking staff by name. I knew that I wanted a room with a rock shower and I got it. It was worth it. We stayed in room 404 and located near the King's Pond - a bit of a walk from the lobby but the walk is so nice you won't care. The amenities in the room were excellent, everything is immaculate. We never left the resort the whole time there. The food at Alan Wong's grille was superb. We ate there for dinner two nights in a row and ordered the tasting menu with wine pairing. The Pahuia and Beach Tree was ok but if Alan Wong's is open go there for every meal. It's also a golfer's paradise with a very nice course, great service (the beverage cart guy was a hoot) and memorable holes. The personalized bag tag and shoe cleaning was a very classy touch. I highly recommend using the gym and spa facilities, especially if you are looking for a quiet pool to relax. The infinity pool was gorgeous but crowded as to be expected. Again the staff is wonderful and very attentive. It's EXPENSIVE but if you can afford it, you will not regret staying here. We never left the resort the whole time there and were so sad to leave. My only comfort is knowing that I will be going back again and again.",Jul 2006,June 2006,Traveled as a couple,,"Long Beach, CA"
5440973,50,"I cannot say enough good things about this hotel, but I'll give it a try -","My husband and I finished off our two week honeymoon with a stay at the Four Seasons Hualalai and to date, this is the most luxurious, relaxing place I have ever had the good fortune to stay at. I am just now sitting down to organize all the photographs from our trip and am being reminded constantly of how perfect everything was during our stay there.    December was a perfect time to visit. I woke up one morning, wandered out onto our balcony and saw a humpback whale breaching in the distance. I was so excited I jumped up and down for an hour. Our room overlooked the King's pond, a brackish pool with dozens of colorful fish and eagle rays that were a blast to look at snorkling for children and adults alike. We did not have an outdoor shower, but frankly our bathroom was so gorgeous I couldn't imagine it being all that much better.    The first night we arrived we had dinner out on the lanai, overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Heaven. Every other night we ate on property, which while pricey, was delicious. I am somewhat of a foodie (ok, I just like to eat a lot!) and it's amazing how far a friendly chat with the chef will get you. I was treated to all kinds of off-menu items and knowledgeable, in-depth conversations with the waiters. (aside to fellow chow-hounds - make sure to visit the gourmet grocery in Kona, and buy the organic flower-scented white honey. Also there is a local chocolate factory that produces fantastic bittersweet bars. There is a gift-basket shipping service run by a nice Canadian woman conviently located next-door that will put together your packages and ship them anywhere you want via FedEx).    The kids center was on our walk home from the restaurants, and was left open late at night, which is fun if you're a little tipsy and you feel like going a few rounds of Playstation2. The beaches were not perfect on resort, but the staff were happy to tell me about a black-sand beach well within driving distance that was hidden to all but those in the know.    After the first day of hearing, ""Aloha!"" from every staff member, my husband and I started to respond with, ""How you doin'?"" to give them a little NY welcome in return. Everyone smiled and laughed with us. I didn't find the Aloha to be obnoxious in the least, and if guests wanted to just nod in return, none of the staff were offended. There were experts available in anything you could possibly want to do or learn about, from golfing to scuba to surfing to Hawa'iin Culture, and they all seemed genuinely happy to share their knowledge with you. For me, it felt like I was learning a part of the local traditions instead of being hermetically sealed off from the island I'd come to visit as is so often the case on these resorts.    I think the only downside would be that we didn't get to spend enough time there, so I raced us all over the island looking at the volcano, Hilo, the mountain ranges instead of just chilling out at the resort. I guess I just have to plan on going back some time soon!",Jul 2006,December 2004,,,"Flower Mound, Texas"
5439558,50,Heaven on Earth!,"My husband and I just returned from a five day stay at the Four Seasons at Hualalai. We could not imagine a better hotel experience. Everything was perfect from the moment we drove up, where we were greeted by name by the valet, to the complementary chocolate cake in our room for my husband's birthday, to the moment we (regretfully) drove off with cool water bottles provided by the hotel for our drive. Our room (203) was a large downstairs room with an outdoor shower (lovely and exotic) overlooking King's Pond (the snorkel pond). It was very quiet and away from the hustle and bustle. This was a thoughful touch as there were *many* families with several small children staying at the resort. (I have nothing against children, but we left ours at home and I did not want to deal with other people's kids.) Housekeeping was excellent. Our room was spotless and cleaned at least twice a day. The ""quiet pool"" was very relaxing, and we barely wanted to move from our cabana. Everything others have mentioned (the person who refills your water glass with fresh iced water, the Evian spritz, the sunglass cleaning, the complementary fresh fruit) were all great--service was unobtrusive and gracious. We had the bed and breakfast package, and had the breakfast buffet each morning which was outstanding. The food overall was very good, even the casual (though expensive) lunch menu at the Beach Tree.

Service, room, facilities, restaurants, etc. all top notch- and hey- for those prices it should be! The quiet pool was excellent as well as the pool service with your usual water, pineapple, cold towelettes, and then there was the sunglass cleaning Evian spraying lady that just set it over the edge. The food was excellent at the resort- and I kid you knot- we never left the resort for 5 days! I recommend getting outdoor massages which were so nice and relaxing. Also - room service breakfast served on your terrace overlooking the water- a great way to start the day. The snorkel pool is also a very cool feature and makes a nice alternative to ocean snorkel trips. I can't wait to go back.

5362166,50,World Traveller Says Hands-Down THE BEST!!,"I have stayed at some of the nicest hotels and the Four Seasons is hands-down NUMBER ONE. Once you set foot on the resort, you don't even have to move a finger (except to dial or ask for what you want!)    I took my girlfriend there to get engaged and Vaugh (the catering mgr) set up a ""Romantic Dinner on the Beach"" for me (request David as your waiter). They found a remote spot along the beach, about 10 feet from the water, and set up a private dinner for me. Then we had a personal waiter come by and make sure our dinner went smoothly. This is a VERY nice touch if you want to do something special! We also had a bonfire after dinner and made s'mores. This was a bit overpriced, so skip the bonfire part.    The hotel itself is wonderful. I took everyone's recommendations on here to get the downstairs rooms with the outdoor showers, which are fabulous! It is a unique touch that I am glad I got to experience. The room I got was a downstairs, ocean view room (unit 1703), and it was as close to the beach as u can get. From my patio, I could walk 20 steps and be at the pool, or walk 25 steps and be at the beach! It was fabulous. They even made up my room several times a day, left clean linens, left after-dinner mints, etc.    The front desk, bellmen, catering, and restaurant people will do anything to make your stay pleasant. They bend over backwards for you. They are THAT GOOD. They will come by and change your water every hour when you are laying out, so you dont have to drink warm water. They spritz you with mist, and bring you drinks.    The sauna / pool / locker rooms are amazing. My room wasn't ready when I got there, so I got a locker, used the sports facility to change, swam for a bit, and then showered there. They have everything u need from slippers to shavers to hair gel! There is plenty of passion fruit tea and water everywhere and attendants are constantly cleaning up so as to not leave anything messy.    I would recommend the bed and breakfast. There is NOTHING like having breakfast in your room on the patio at 600 am (I was still on California time) and watching the sunrise. They even do little things like bring a toaster to your room so your bread wont be cold.    Another nice touch is the Floral Bath. My fiance loved it.    If you are deciding between this and another hotel, stay here. I went to Maui after this hotel and it was so crumby compared to the Big Island. This island has not a lot of tourists, and isn't run over by huge families and screaming kids. This is truly a place for romance and for good, adult fun.",Jun 2006,June 2006,,,"Irvine, California"
5342990,50,We're Four Seasons People...................,"My husband and I took my in-laws here and had a delightful time. We are Four Seasons people and got married at the Four Seasons Palm Beach, been to Costa Rica's Four Seasons, Las Vegas, Beverly Hills.....you get the picture. We were upgraded on this trip into two suites (this being a first besides our wedding night) and it was great. My in-laws had a great 2nd story suite with a great view and my husband and I got a great floor suite with an outdoor shower which was amazing.    This is the most beautiful resort we have been to. The service was very good and things I was concerned about were the following:    1. Activities: Check out our pics on my second review. Couldn't fit all the pics on one. We jammed packed our days with nearby activities, none of which I regret doing. Everything was very accessible. We did a snorkel tour, tour to Mauna Kea (a must!), Helicopter tour over both sides of island (saw volcano erupting) and golf at the resort.    2. Beach: The four seasons has an area where they have put in almost like a rock wall so you can swim in the ocean. Basically the waves brake on that and you are able to swim fine without drowning. The water was warm enough for us Floridians in December. It was a little chilly on our morning snorkel tour, but we saw turtles and wonderful fish so it was definitely worth it.    3. Rental car: It's easy to get around. There is really only one highway so if you miss your stop, you can just turn around. It's VERY easy to drive around here except I will tell you there are no lights at night.    4. Food: Breakfast service was not that great, but it's not dinner, so who cares. The dinner and service were excellent at night at the main restaurant and the golf club has a great restaurant on the property which is wonderful also, comparable to the Four Seasons main restaurant. Lunch on the beach was great at the casual restaurant, but the residence club restaurant for lunch was just okay.    5. Rooms: Very clean, very spacious (suite) and outdoor shower, again, a must!    6. Pools: There was plenty of selection. We hung out on the beach (which is public....so I must tell you a couple of wierdos did make it down there, but nothing tooo bizarre. Did see a wierd He-She, but hopefully they are not locals). The adult infinity pool is wonderful. They also have another family pool on the beach and a fish pond which is very light (clear) and full of fish and a stingray. It wasn't gross -- kind of cool, esp. for kids.    Hopefully that gives you some insight. The colors on the island are amazing and the sights if you decide to venture out are even more amazing.",Jun 2006,December 2005,,,
5342963,50,Activities we did while we stayed at Four Seasons Hualalai,"This is my second review. We could not fit all of our pictures in so I just wanted to show you what we did on the Big Island while we stayed at the Four Seasons Hualalai.  We had a great time on every activity. This is what we chose:    Dolphin Discovery: Snorkel and whale watching snorkel A.M tour. (Did not see dolphins or whales, but many turtles and great fish.)    Mauna Kea tour (a must!) Unbelievable. You have no idea of how many stars are in the sky. We could not take picutes of this leg of the trip, but we saw mars and venus with the naked eye as well as numerous falling stars and we watched the sattellites move around in a circle......amazing!    Helicopter tour over both sides of the island by Blue Hawaiian (we took the eco-star). Great! We saw lava flowing into the ocean and an erupting volcano. (Video only showed the second half of our trip)    Hope that helps. Enjoy!",Jun 2006,,,,
5329736,50,Four Seasons is five stars for your honeymoon!,"WOW! The Four Seasons Hualalai was our last stop on our two week honeymoon and we wish that we can stay longer (we're still here, I'm sitting on my lana'i watching the sun set right now!)....this place is not just a hotel resort, this is a sanctuary for anyone who wants to truly relax and soak up the beauty of the island. The staff is excellent, able and willing to do ANYTHING for you! The floor-level bungalows have an outdoor shower that is fantastic (whoever came up with that one is a genius!!)...you literally shower outside with the stars shining down on you surrounded by fresh orchids, tropical plants and those peaceful smooth lavarocks as the base of the shower....AMAZING!...don't worry, no one can see you shower! The restaurants are out-of-this-world!...a little pricy, but hey, it's your honeymoon...SPLURGE!! If you like to snokle, you can do it in a safely here in King's Pond which is a man made aquatic habitat which contains over ninety different types of marine life!...I didn't golf, but I walked the course and it's beautiful (Jack Nicholas signature course) The Maui Four Seasons is fantastic, but this Four Seasons blows the other right out of the water! There is nothing negative to say about this ""Heaven on Earth!""..I highly reccommend to anybody who wants to top off their honeymoon with one last luxurious stay. I can not wait to come back here!!!",Jun 2006,June 2006,,,"Chicago, Illinois"
5291539,50,Fabulous,"We stayed at the Four Seasons as a bit of a splurge, and it was wonderful. What we loved about the hotel:    1) PRIVACY - the way the rooms are set up, with one on top of another and set apart like little condos with own private little entry way is really nice. Gives you a sense of privacy. Same with all the pool areas.    2) Pools - There are several different pool areas, which is nice because not everyone is crowded at one spot (like they were at the Fairmont Orchid, where we stayed after leaving the Four Seasons). And, they spread out the pool chairs so you're not right next to a stranger. There's actually space (and a good amount) between pairs of chairs. You think this is to be expected, but it is not (e.g. Fairmont Orchid). We spent most of our time at the King's Pool (where you can snorkel with fish, etc.) and the Quiet pool. Most of the time, we were the only people in the water, which was great.    3) Quiet beach front - they have wonderful beach chairs that are paired together with a built-on sunshade, and when you pull that up, you feel totally isolated and secluded. You can just sit and watch the water, sip a cocktail or have lunch. Wonderful.    4) Food - the food was fantastic. The breakfast buffet is excellent, as were both the restaurants for dinner. Even after we left the hotel we went back to one of the restaurants for dinner, I liked it so much. Even the food from the beach area restaurant was good.    5) Room - the room was very nice, was good sized bathroom and lovely oversized shower and separate bath. All done in a nice slate. It wasn't anything spectacular, but it was what I expected.    6) Grounds - the grounds are beautifully kept, although sometimes confusing. Again, lots of privacy.    Negatives - I'd say cost is the main thing. This place is expensive. And you can't really get any ""deals"" on rooms. Food is also very expensive. Is it worth the $800 we paid per night to stay there? Hmm, not sure. It definitely was fabulous, but $800 is not cheap to me. But, after comparing to the Fairmont Orchid where we stayed next, I'd say if you can get a room for almost the same price as the Fairmont (which is possible, since the Fairmont charges upwards of $500 too), I'd DEFINITELY stay at the Four Seasons instead. Much, much more privacy and much nicer pool areas, room, restaurants, etc. Honestly, I was stunned by the differences between the Four Seasons and the Fairmont.    another negative is that there isn't really a beach for swimming. That didn't really matter to us, but if that's what you're looking for, then you'll be disappointed.",May 2006,December 2005,,,"Los Angeles, California"
5289713,50,Incredible. No need to leave the hotel.,"This was a great place for anyone's first trip to Hawaii. We booked three nights there and wish we had stayed all but one of our six nights on the Island (giving us one night at the Volcano). We could have relaxed at the hotel and toured Hilo from there.    We only ate at the hotel and only needed to eat at the hotel--the fish--many different kinds--offered a nightly treat. Staff, grounds, etc...perfect.",May 2006,,,,San Francisco
5226627,50,"Great stay at Hualalai, here are some tips","We stayed at the FS Hualalai May 8 – 14th. Overall, our experience was outstanding.    May is a good time to stay at Hualalai because the kids are back in school. We strolled by the kids fun center and it was completely empty. There were families, but all with pre-school or infants.    Accommodations: We stayed in #1610 and were very pleased. Building 16 is close to the lobby building so I could roll out of bed, stroll up to the Lobby early and get two cups of complimentary coffee to go. Our guest room was a second floor unit with a better view of the Pacific than the ground floor units. The trade-off is no secluded private outdoor shower, which is a popular feature of the resort. We think the best locations are buildings 15, 16, 17, and 18, with room 1801 as the best ocean front room. Next time, we’ll request #1610 again or #1801.    Restaurants: We dined at Pahu I’ A for one breakfast and dinner, and the same for the Beach Tree Restaurant. All four dining experiences met our expectations. We enjoyed the Hualalai Coffee Company, which is the little food/beverage outlet, adjacent to the tennis courts and the Hualalai Trading Company (convenience store for the year-round residents). There, you can take-out continental breakfast items, and for lunch, tuna or turkey wraps. Since we had a rental car we explored the Island and had dinners at The Pavillion (Mauna Kea Beach Resort), Brown’s Beach House (Fairmont Orchid), and the CanoeHouse (Mauna Lani). Pahu I’ A at the FS was our favorite, followed by Brown’s Beach House. We were under-whelmed with the CanoeHouse and The Pavillion. Next time, we’ll dine at Alan Wong’s Grill located above the FS golf pro shop.    Things to do:  1.Enjoy the sports and spa facilities. They are terrific.  2.Enjoy the beach. It’s peaceful and the beverage service was prompt.  3.Stop by Hualalai Sports Center and sign-up for the morning snorkel cruise.  4.Play at least one round of golf. It’s very scenic and fairly forgivable.  5.Rent a Mustang convertible so you can drive north along highway 19, to visit the Kings Shops at Waikoloa and the restaurants that we’ve noted above, then left on highway 270 up to Hawi, then back south along highway 250 to Waimea. We also made the time to see the Waipi’o Valley lookout and drove to Akaka Falls. A drive to Kona town along Alii Drive is fun.    We liked the Four Seasons Hualalai more than the FS Great Exuma. The accommodations, amenities and overall service was much better. Next May we’re headed to the FS Punta Mita, but we’ll return to Hualalai in 2008 or 2009, if not sooner.",May 2006,May 2006,,,"McKinney, TX"
5188185,30,What is this???,"Simply put...a beautiful setting with an over enthusiastic staff that knows it is the only game around. Rude gym attendant and insincere staff which, apparently, is under the directive to speak to you at any chance, making relaxation a bit of a chore outside your room.  Without planning, it is quite hard to get into a restaurant to eat, and nothing is close to the resort for outside eating options. Using room service only once during our visit, we found that the food was below satisfactory.  For the price, it just didn't satisfy...",May 2006,May 2006,,,Roamin' The World
5180365,30,Too much Aloha!!!,"Too much attention. No one leaves you alone. The staff is required to say "" Aloha"" to everyone within 25 feet. It doesn't matter if you are looking the other way, engrossed in conversation, or just kicking back, the insincere greeting you are forced to reply to is ""Aloha"". This would be okay if it happened once or twice a day. But NO, this happens maybe 40 times a day ( depending if your are outdoors).    The beds need replacing- they sag and require bed boards to hold them up.    The food is overpriced.    The grounds are beautiful, but the ocean is so rough in front of the hotel the red flag flies most of the time. (no swimming).    The internert was free, DVD's are free.    It is closest to the airport- maybe 10 minutes. No problem with aircraft noise.    The gym is outstanding, but again there is always the ""aloha"" guy bothering you.    This hotel is nice, but expensive.    Stay here only if you plan to double your hotel bill.",May 2006,,,,"Fallbrook, California"
5076859,50,Amazing,"Just returned from a week's stay here and I can't wait to go back. The resort is amazing. Spread out and so quiet. We had an upper bungelow. Our entrance was on the other side of the downstairs, so we never saw anyone going into that room. We never heard anyone either. The room was beautiful with a great view of the main pool and ocean. We were told the resort was at 90% occupancy, but it seemed almost empty. Never a wait at any restaurant. It just seemed like there weren't many people around. Very peaceful. The service was extraordinary. Maid service was fast and top notch. Everyone went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable. The grounds are beautiful. All the pools are great. I just can't say enough about the service. This is the place to go to relax. If you want more action you should stay elsewhere. No resort on the big island compares.",May 2006,May 2006,Traveled on business,,Northern California
5066329,50,Four Seasons veteran,"Just came back from my fourth visit to the Four Seasons Hualalai. I absolutely love it, the best hotel I have ever stayed in.There is no place as relaxing that I have ever been. It is close to Kona/Kailua, so driving into town is no big deal. For a little bit less expensive room, try staying on the golf course end of the property, in a downstairs room. The downstairs rooms have the wonderful outdoor shower, and the golf course rooms are certainly more convenient to the spa and lobby, and in addition have their own little parking lot, so you don't have to go through valet every time you want your car. The only negative is that I think the food in the restaurants is a little pricey, and if you don't like fish the selections are limited. Don't miss the Saturday night beach barbeque, however, it is wonderful.",May 2006,May 2006,,,oklahoma city
5064726,50,"Great, but..","We picked this hotel for a honeymoon.    Things you need to know:    If you want an outdoor shower, you must pick a bottom unit (upper levels do not have this option).  If you have kids, or dont mind children, stay at the kids section.  Ocean views are really only for upper lvls. However, you can stay on the lower lvls behind/by Pahu I'a or by the beach tree area.  They have great poolside service.  The oceans amazing, but dont expect to swim much in it. Lava rocks section off areas for kids to roam, but cant do much else beyond that  If you like sea life, this place is great. Sea turtles float around and come up to shore. The kings pond has a great selection of tropical fish so you can snorkel in a safe enviroment    Plusses:    May was a great time to go  Bungalow provides you with your own hut type of feel  My wife was in love with the place  When we arrived we received leis (sp) and a tour of the place.  We stayed near the ""kiddie pool"" but it really wasnt that loud.  Wife had a blast snorkeling  Food was excellent (Pahu I'a was a little rich for our taste. $200 and a mediocre meal ..)    Few cons:    Walls are thin, if your neighbors are loud, you hear it (so we returned the favor: [--]  Housekeeping was slow every day. Like 3-4-5pm was when our rooms were getting clean.  The birds run rampant in this place, so you couldnt leave trays outside your room. You had to call to have room service remove them, and if they took a while, your room would smell like old meat :)  It was a spendy trip, dont go if you like bargains. However if you would like to be treated like royalty, this is the place for you.    Pool attendands wipe sunglasses off, sprits you with cool water, provide cool towels. Chefs at the restaurants buffet lines are excellent (i really liked the italian chef at the beat tree), staff is very friendly - constantly greeting you with aloha's and other hawaiian jibberish.    Oh, and at night the grounds are lit by tiki torches that stay lit all night. So you can go for a romantic stroll and a midnight hot tub dip. Or romping on the beach if youre really adventerous..    If youre not a huge fan of laying out and baking, be sure to get a rental car so you dont get too bored. But then again, why stay here if all youre doing is sleeping?",May 2006,May 2006,,,Minnesota
5040205,50,"Beautiful hotel, great service","I had read some of the negative reviews about the service at this Four Seasons, but our experience was completely excellent.    It started when we landed at the airport, and a person from the hotel was there to greet us and direct us to our car rental. As soon as we drove up to the hotel, the staff was at the door ready with drinks and cold towels. Our luggage was taken away, and we were whisked to our room in a golf cart without ever entering the lobby!    We had a ground floor ocean view room near King's Pond, the last pool. It was very nice, although not as private as some of the other hotels. Luckily this pool had hardly anyone using it, and is only open from 10-4. I would request a room at this end of the resort next time -- it would not be so great to be right next to one of the more popular pools. Our room was lovely.    Our first nite we wanted a casual dinner and ate at the Beach Tree Grill. You can sit at tables right on the sand. The food is casual, but how wonderful to be served dinner right on the beach! It was so wonderfully romantic that we did it again the second nite. This time they had some nice music. For the last nite, we had dinner at the Hualalai Grille, the hotel's fine dining restaurant and it was the best meal we had on the entire trip. We're usually more adventurous and venture out to eat, but this resort is really hard to leave.    The pools were all fun. We even snorkeled a bit in the Kings Pond which is stocked with tropical fish and two eagle rays that you can feed (very fun). The only drawback is that the beach is not for swimming -- lots of rocks and very rough water. Having a ""quiet"" adult pool is very nice.    We did a long day trip to Volcanoe Nat'l Park. It's about a 2.5 hour drive there and back, but worth it. Hiked both the craters and to the lava flow. What awesome sights!    Next day we didn't leave the resort. We used the pools and sat on the beach, worked out at the gym, and I had a massage. They have wonderful outside treatment rooms where you can relax to the sounds of waterfall, ocean, and birds. Be sure to request one of these when you book your appointment.    We never encountered a single employee at this hotel who did not greet us with a smile and an ""aloha"". Anyone we encountered a second time remembered our names. Service is absolutely superb and even a notch above what we have come to expect from a Four Seasons.",May 2006,May 2006,,,"Los Altos Hills, CA"

Any whinging spoiled brat who doesn't give it 5 out of 5 should spend a day in Mexico living as a local. It is undoubtedly expensive, but for God's sake get over yourselves and look at what you get. A tidal pool with turtles, feeding eagle rays, beach beds with sun covers, someone to fill your water glass (and if it is empty for an hour and you are thirsty get off your lazy behind and do something about it rather than sit there seething.) It is certainly not good value, but it is a special special place.    Good Lord some people don't really live in the real world do they.",May 2006,April 2006,,,Sydney
5019710,40,Mixed feelings - great facilities with so-so service,"Having stayed at a number of FS properties and with the one in Maui in particular, we expected seamless and flawless execution from service to facilities. However, there were a number of blemishes in regards to service. Upon on our arrival, we were given a room with 2 double beds when a king bed was requested, and we had to ask the receptionist to confirm our spa appointments that were schdueled for that afternoon - he was not aware of anything other than the room reservation. We had expected the spa confirmation upon check in as that had been our previous experience in Maui FS. Worse still, we had to wait over 15 minutes for valet service to take us to the room. And when he finally showed us to the room, the bags were dropped off quickly and he was in a rush to get out with only a perfunctory explanation of the room and services offered.    To the hotel's credit, they did move us to a room with a king size bed the next day and it was in a better location. We got a lower level ocean view room which had a lovely outdoor shower and was located towards the quiter side of the grounds near the 18th hole of the golf course. The rooms are nice in neutral tones, but nothing too memorable. Bathroom was on the small side. Walls are thin (like everyone else has mentioned) and you are able to hear the room next to you and/or movement from the top floor if you are on the lower level. Luckily this was not a problem.    Spa and gym facilities were excellent, very top notch. We ate at the Hualalai restuarant a few times and food was decent (dessert was excellent), service was great and their wine selection terrible (probably too jaded from living in the Bay area). Poolside service was good overall, but we wished they could have been a tad faster to set up the chairs. The beach is not swimable, but the wide range of pools made up for that. And kids we saw seemed to be having a blast playing on the beach.    At check out, there was even a longer delay - 20 minutes - waiting for the valet to come pick up the bags. We had to call the bell desk a couple of times before the valet showed up. They did have the rental car ready and loaded it quickly. But again, we expected far more seamless service from FS.    Given the high expectations and the great experiences we've had at other FS properties, we felt a little let down at this hotel. Making poor first and last impressions on guests is certainly not something that we want from FS. Overall, we are left with mixed feelings; knowing that this great hotel could have been an excellent hotel if it hadn't been marred by some of its services shortcomings.",Apr 2006,April 2006,,,"Oakland, CA"
4964944,30,Don't go during Spring Break,"My sixteen year old Daughter and I just returned from a six night stay (3/24-3/30) at the Four Seasons Hualalai. This was our third trip to the resort, but our first in four years. Our previous two trips were absolutely fantastic, with service above and beyond our expectations. Based on our experience during those trips, we would not have made this trip if we could not stay at the Four Seasons. The purpose of this trip was two-fold. First, to give Mom a bit of a break, since I left my 3 and 6 year old daughters at home with my Husband, and secondly, to give my daughter an opportunity to play golf in preparation for an April tournament.    First, I would like to mention the positive aspects of this trip. Everyone at the golf course and clubhouse went out of their way to make sure my Daughter’s golf experience was a memorable one. She plays MANY rounds of golf every year, and the three rounds she played at Hualalai were among the most enjoyable, right down to the audience on the 18th hole who cheered for her when she made a birdie. We especially enjoyed meeting Wes in the pro shop. He made a rainy Monday afternoon pleasurable! Please stop in and tell Wes that Lauren and her Mom from Chicago say hi!! We also had a wonderful experience in the sports club and spa. The equipment in the sports club was plentiful, and in wonderful shape. My daughter and I both had massages, and they were among the best we have ever had. Do be aware that the area where the machines are located is not air conditioned. Normally, that wouldn't bother me, but with the ""VOG"" in the air currently, it caused my asthma to act up. All in all, a lovely work out area!!    Unfortunately, the negatives of this trip outweigh the positives. I had read comments on this board about the noise prevalent in guest rooms. I had not experienced this on either of our two previous visits, but was definitely aware of the problem on this trip. The guests in the suite next to our room had two young children. They placed the crib on the wall adjoining our room, and proceeded to let the little boy cry on many occasions. I guess they were sleeping soundly, or just did not choose to attend to the child. This became a regular occurrence, especially at 5:15 am. Having young children who still occasionally cry, I was really looking forward to having a break from this. There is nothing worse than being awoken from a sound sleep at 5:15 am and looking for your child who you think is crying, only to remember that your young children aren’t with you. We also had Four Seasons employees outside our door one morning at 7 am pruning trees. That would be fine, but the employee was having a loud conversation via a walkie talkie with a woman who had a very loud voice. While I understand that the resort can’t control what other guest do, they can request that employees not disturb guests at such an early hour. A bit of soundproofing might also protect the rooms from the sounds of loud carts being driven on the path in the early morning hours. We did go to the front desk and request a new room, but unfortunately there were no other double bedded rooms available. We checked back daily, but were never able to make a room change. We felt that we spent our whole vacation living on someone else’s schedule instead of one of our own choosing.    One of the things that we have most enjoyed in the past during our stay was the pool service. We tend to spend a lot of time by the pool when we travel, and have referred many friends to the Four Seasons on Maui and Hualalai simply to experience the superb pool service. We found the service to be sub par on this trip. My water glass sat empty for an hour one morning, and the pool was not even very busy. It was also difficult to get service to order lunch by the pool. I did order lunch on two occasions, and both times my order was incorrect when I received it.    We definately enjoyed the ""quiet pool"" on this visit. Everyone respected the no cell phone rule, and it was quite relaxing. The infinity pool was quite over-run with spoiled ""rich kids"" from S. California. It makes me glad that I'm raising my children in the midwest!!    We dined at Pahui’a for breakfast every morning. This is also something that we have enjoyed on past trips. It was always nice to be greeted by name each morning. On this trip, we were still asked our name by the 6th morning. Had this been my first trip to the resort, I would not have missed this, but it’s something that I have always been impressed with on previous trips to Maui and Hualalai.    We still did enjoy our stay, and made a point of not thinking too much about the problems while we were there. Now that we have been home a few days, and had time to think about the trip, I truly feel that the trip did not meet our expectations. I can’t think of a single trip to a Four Seasons Resort in the past where I looked at the bill when I got home, and thought that my money could have been better spent at another resort. This time I do feel as if my $7,000 could have been better spent. If this had been my first trip to the resort, I would definitely not rush to visit again.    I do hope that we just caught the resort during a “off week”. I did fax a letter to the General Manager when we returned home outlining my concerns. Within days of faxing the letter, I received a response from the resort manager, along with an offer for one free night on our next visit. I truly don't think that the compensation is enough for our troubles, but might consider a return trip during a less busy time.",Apr 2006,March 2006,,,"Chicago, IL"

You can ask for a room in or away from family areas- we stayed in a non family area and it was very quiet (the pool was adults-only).

4774016,50,"A pricey, but nice respite from the real world!","I was not sure what to expect here, but decided to splurge. I am so glad I did. I am not sure what happened, but I ended up with a two category room upgrade, and had an ocean view room in the ""quiet"" Palm Grove, which actually was pretty quiet! I had paid for a golf course view, figuring I rarely use a view. I was so glad for the upgrade, and enjoyed several wonderful hours out reading on the lanai and listening to the ocean.    This is a classically understated resort--truly the antithesis of the Four Seasons property on Maui. There is no other way to define it. The rooms are what you would expect at such a resort, and the guests are too, although during spring break it can be a little dicey. The whole environment embraces the natural environs, and it is such a peaceful experience.    Ross, the bellman, is delightful. I checked in at 9am en route to a whale watching expedition. They could not have been nicer or more welcoming. Free valet parking was a nice perk (or the option to self-park, also for free)!    I had a wonderful facial at the spa, and a relaxing massage. The facilities are reserved for guests and residents only, so it is relatively easy to get appointment times.    I did have a problem in the Grille with my dinner one night and thought it was handled poorly. I spoke with the hotel manager about it the next morning. Despite the fact that the restaurant is not actually affiliated with the Four Seasons (just uses the property) she was lovely. She sent me some chocolate-covered strawberries, and the manager at the Pahu i'a (which *is* associated with the 4S) offered me dessert the next night on the house. That's the service that the 4S is known for.    Some on this site have complained about the beach, which isn't really swimmable. But there are 4 (FOUR!!!) pools, one of which is a salt-water lagoon with fish and eels for snorkeling and two pools which are deemed ""quiet"" pools. Besides, one of the most beautiful beaches in the entire country (wonderfully soft sand, swimmable, snorkeling, boogie boarding, etc) is about 15 minutes up the road at Hapuna Beach. GREAT facilities at Hapuna Beach State Park. . .why complain???    Would I stay again? In a heartbeat! Thank you, Four Seasons, for a wonderful respite!",Mar 2006,March 2006,,,Maryland
4771777,40,Great for families and active adults,"We just returned from a two week vacation on the Big Island with our 5 and 6 year old. The first week we stayed at the Four Seasons and had a fabulous time. The Kids for all Seasons Program is amazing -- very professionally run. The resort has a beautiful cultural center where the kids learned the hula, how to play the ukelele,, made ipu's, fed the spotted eagle ray in the fish pond, went swimming, did great arts and crafts etc. The counselors were so sweet and really on top of things. My son has a nut allergy and they were trained to administer an epi-pen -- almost unheard of at a resort. You were also able to drop off your child and pick them up any time during the hours of 8 and 5 and the program was complimentary. My kids made some great friends there and are still talking about how much fun they had.  For the adults -- my husband and I really enjoyed the gym, tennis, golf and spa. The gym is really first class-- every machine you could think of -- soup to nuts including tv's on the aerobic machines with personal headphones, attendants who bring you ice water and towels while you are exercising.  The tennis program was top shelf for kids and adults. They had daily clinics for adults and clinics every other day for kids where they earned tokens they could trade in for treats.  The golf course was great and my husband had no problem getting t times. He really enjoyed himself.  The food was really fantastic -- New york standards. We specially loved Alan Wong's restaurant at the golf course. The rooms were beautiful -- great linens on the bed, beautiful bath and a huge walk in closet. I did hear people walking in the suite above us one night but who cares?  The only down side is the beach -- it is man made and not great. We spent our second week at the Mauna Kae where the beach is beautiful but the hotel is sub par to try to strike a balance.",Mar 2006,March 2006,,,"Fairfield County, CT"
4734464,50,The Best Hotel on the Big Island,My husband and I just returned from the Big Island. We spent 10 days there and stayed at several hotels while we there. The Four Seasons was by far the best hotel we have ever stayed at. Not just on this trip but on any trip. The service was outstanding from the moment we arrived and pulled up to moment they put us in the car. For what we were paying I would expect that kind of service and they delieved. It was worth the price we paid. We ate at the restaurants on the property and the food was amazing. One of the best breakfast buffets I have ever had. The pools were great for swimming in with our four month old son. The water was heated a little and perfect for swimming. I really can't say enough about this hotel. We will be back for sure.,Mar 2006,March 2006,,,"Chicago, IL"
4567926,20,Failed to Meet Expectations!,"This resort fell WELL SHORT of expectations when I stayed there in Feb '06. The room views are poor in many locations (I had an ocean view of cabanas in front of my room despite paying for an ""ocean view""). In addition, the noise pollution from other adjacent rooms can be significant. For instance, one night I heard the constant footsteps of the guest above me (in addition to the guest next door!). While the room furnishings and comfort were great and in-line with Four Seasons standards, the noise level combined with the poor view left me greatly disappointed. The overall food experience, although expensive, was excellent. The beach is terrible (basically nonexistant save a small tidal pool about the size of one of the resort swimming pools)so don't even think about going swimming in the ocean. Overall service was good, although my room was not made up until the afternoon. In short, this hotel cannot justify the stratospheric prices in light of these troublesome issues. While I have stayed at other high end hotels in Hawaii, including the Princeville, the Four Seasons/Maui, as well as the Hapuna Beach Prince, I would rate the Hualalai near the bottom. In fact I stayed at other hotels on the Big Island for one third the cost and have been vastly more satisfied!    Subjective ratings:    Rooms (appointments): 5 stars  Rooms (build quality/design): 1 star(noise, view)  Beach : 2 stars (mostly rocky)  Food: 5 stars  Service 3.5 stars  Value: 1 star",Feb 2006,February 2006,,,"Atlanta, GA"
4565267,50,A Piece of Heaven,We absolutely loved this resort. It catered to adults as well as families. There was a beautiful quiet pool (olympic size) sitting next to the ocean where you were isolated from the hub bub of the noisy pool next door. The rooms were spectacular and really enjoyed the outdoor shower surrounded by foliage and orchids. We really appreciated the ready access to washers and dryers so we did not have to take dirty clothes to our next destination. The service was wonderful and restaurants superb (especially Alan Wong's restaurant at the golf course). We wished that we would have booked for an entire week instead of just the four days that we were there.,Feb 2006,February 2006,,,
4463168,50,"Great hotel, nice staff","We stayed at the 4S for 3 nights while in Kona. The hotel was extremely expensive (almost $1K/night) and might actually be worth it. There are 3 pools and a swimming lagoon, each with its own ""feel"". The most popular was the beachtree pool, which is supposed to be a ""quiet"" area for reading and sunbathing. Most guests respect this, but there were several of the typical California folks who feel they might die if their cell phones go unused at all times. One can only hope the link between malignant transformation and radio waves is exposure dependent. There was even one clown who brought out speakers for his iPod!. Fortunately, the staff shut that down quickly. However, the staff and the beauty of the place make these niggles hard to remember. The swimming lagoon was also great (3000 fish) and the water is cold enough to deter most from visiting for long, There were never more that 4 people at the lagoon at any time other than the eagle ray feeding times (2 PM, really neat!). Breakfast at Pahu'ia was a wonderful buffet, and dinner at the grille was the best meal I'd had in weeks (go early to get the chef's tasting menu).    Another review mentioned the thin walls of the rooms - we noticed this as well. The seniors staying next to us were early risers, and the noise of the housekeeping staff in their room was definitely noticeable.    Overall, a great hotel with wonderful staff and a beautiful setting. Just bring $$$!",Feb 2006,February 2006,,,"Houston, Texas"
4440822,50,amazing resort with kids,"We just got back from four days at the 4S with our two year old and 5 month old, and it was wonderful! This resort has really made an effort to accommodate children. We travel a lot with our kids, and this is one of the best experiences we have had.    The children's pool is adorable - it is about 2 feet deep, and has sand on the bottom. There is a larger pool right next to it as well. They have lots of plastic toys, and people brought their own floating toys. There are beautiful cabanas all around the pool where you can relax yet be close to the little ones. They will set up a Pack N Play next to your chaise lounge, so baby can play or nap poolside. And they have free sunscreen and Swimmies (pool diapers) for the kids. FYI, the sun is very strong, so pack a bathing suit that covers the whole body - everyone ended up buying the surf shirts from the gift shop for their kids.    They provide diapers, wipes, and a travel kit with shampoo, body wash, and diaper lotion, which is a nice touch. All of the kids meals come with french fries (typical) or fruit (unusual, and appreciated). Kids eat for free at the restaurants if they are under 4. There are also washers and dryers that you can use for free, complete with detergent, softener, etc. (I am always cleaning bibs and onesies in the sink when we travel.)    They also have a large saltwater pond stocked with all sorts of exotic fish, and you can take the kids there to help feed them in the morning.    We rented an Exersaucer from Dorkel's Rental, and our 5 month old had a great time playing in it while we were in the room.    Book early - we tried to get back into the 4S after we left for another hotel on the island that we were not happy with, and when we called, they told us they were sold out for all of February! Our daughter kept asking to go back to the kid's pool at the 4S.",Feb 2006,February 2006,,,"Newport Beach, CA"
4395612,50,Lovely ! Ideal Honeymoon Location - just a few issues,This would truly be our DREAM location - if only you could swim in the sea! Due to coral this is not recommended.    We stayed 5 nights in 2003 on our honeymoon and it was fantastic - we are regular Four Seasons and Mandarin Oriental customers so we expect a high level of service and quality. This place was very good - our only faults are as follows :    - walls between rooms are thin - this is not usually an issue but do not go during Spring Break - even though this is a quality hotel we had (rich!) teens staying in the room next door and they partied until 3am on their terrace - in the end WE had to move rather than they - but we moved to a nicer room with a beautiful view.

4372680,50,Best hotel I've stayed in,"This is truly a luxurious hotel, worth staying at for a special occasion. We stayed here for 3 days on our honeymoon while traveling on the Big Island. The hospitality is amazing and you feel so pampered here. Each group of buildings is arranged around a pool, so I think there are 4 ""pools"" (bodies of water) in all, all with different feels. There is a lagoon where you can snorkel, a winding pond on which the restaurant is located, a modern pool with cabanas, and an adults only pool. This means that all the rooms have a view. We were upgraded to a suite, which had two large rooms, and the most luxurious hotel bathroom I've experienced, with a large tub, glass enclosed shower, and outdoor private shower. If you can, request a ground level room so that you have the outdoor shower. There are many things to do here, turtles hang out on the beach, and the food is delicious!",Jan 2006,July 2003,,,"San Diego, California"
4361014,10,Beware of cancellation policy,I was scheduled to visit this resort next week. I called to reschedule to March after my daughter was injured after being thrown from a 4 wheeler this past weekend. I was told that since I was cancelling within the 3 week cancellation period I would forfeit my 2 nights deposit of $1700 and that if I wanted to make another reservation in March it would require another 2 night deposit. None of the other hotels I was planning to visit including the Halekulani in Oahu kept my deposit without offereing any recourse. I have written the Four Seasons world wide headquarters because I cannot imagine that a resort chain that prides itself on providing stellar service to its clientelle would treat one in this way. Just Beware!!,Jan 2006,January 2006,,,GreenwoodSC
4335112,50,AMAZING!,My Husband and I spent a week here on our honeymoon. We arrived here after staying at the Princeville and this was a major upgrade. It is very expensive but worth every penny. The rooms are very spacious and decorated beautifully. The grounds are absolutely gorgeous and all of the hotel restaurants and bars serve some of the best food in the world. When we arrived a staff member met us and retrieved our luggage while we went to get the rental car...it was great! I highly suggest one of the ocean front rooms because you are guaranteed to be right near the beach...it is pricey but worth it. The service was amazing. We hope we can make it back soon!,Jan 2006,September 2005,,,Boston

4280071,50,"Ignore the low rankings, this place is the max, nothing comes close","Ok, reading through the reviews to this place can be mis-leading. It is a pity that some folks may not have had the best experience. My wife and I however cannot even comprehend having a bad time here (unless you can not afford it). My observations are that this place is either a 4 star or 5 star depending how you like the surroundings and whether or not you had a bad experience with service or something. Keep in mind that the people working there are human beings. You would have to be dipped in boiling oil to give less than 4 stars to this place.    That aside, let me share our observations because the details are what makes fine living. I will try to be brief because there is so much to mention. Upon early arrival in a sold out timeframe, we got in our room promptly. They had champagne and fruit for us and cookies and milk for our daughter. We got the romance package and I recommend it to all. All notes to us were hand written and personalized. We were allergic to the plums they gave us and we left a note saying so. The next day we had different fruits and another note. During our stay they set up a telescope outside our room. I took music lessons at the cultural center. -Ohh yes, the artwork there was actually reasonably priced for some of the worlds best artists!- One time my daughter and I were returning from the beach walk and I saw a waitress delivering a couple drinks to the pool guests. I commented that they looked great and can't wait to get back to our room and order one. She stopped, looked at me and said ""I think the bartender made an extra one."" and handed it to me. Another time I remarked to the kids camp counselor that the tea mints from the turn down service were nice, but chocolates were our favorites. That night, a tray of chocolates -nice ones- were on our bed..with another hand-written note. The golf course was second to none and the carts and facilities were un-believabley new (the regular folks hit Titlest NXTs off the range and the pros get ProV1s). I did the 80 min massage and my wife did a treatment. It was tremendous. I asked for a newspaper in the morning and the reply was ""We have 5 different papers to choose from or you can have them all. What would you like?"" We had room 2201 and I would recommend it to any who care to try it. Each night at around 6:30, the pool cleared out and it was like having a private pool (beach tree pool)! Pictures do absolutely no justice, trust me on this! (and the temperature was perfect of course)    Now, the bed, the baths and all the robes and surroundings were fantastic. The tub fills in a minute because it was plumbed properly (nothing like a soaking tub that takes a 1/2 hour to fill). The rooms were a bit sparsely decorated (-.1 points). The outdoor showers were quite romantic. They provide music CDs and the room service prices were not very much differnt that the resturants. which btw...we checked in, went to the Beach Tree for lunch and checked out the menu. I look and see a hamburger for 17 bucks, smiled and looked at my wife and said.. ""ohh well, welcome to Four Seasons."" Well, this 'burger' shows up and the thing is a 1/2 pound of freshly ground filet mignon! It was out of this world! I was so full, we ordered a pizza for dinner in our room. The pizza was stellar!    To wrap this up, my daughter was with only us for two weeks prior in Kauai. She was kinda wanting to play with other kids so we took a walk to the kids center. Now we have seen many other kid care places at many other hotels and they mostly look like prisons (Marriott Lihui). This place was two buildings connected by a roof line. I could not get her away! We felt guilty! On one side was pool tables, pingpong, big screen TVs, air hockey and on teh other side was computers, crafts and games. Sure, you buy the lunch for 15 bucks, big deal. They are taking your kid on adventures, rock climbing, making crafts, feeding manta rays, paddling the outrigger! I mean, cmon how can you rate this place poorly? My daughter still pines about going back. I sat there and said to my wife ""We ought to dump our Kauai timeshare (top notch Marriot) and just come here.""    One last comment. We went to 4S in Mauai. The people there are a bunch of wannabees with a 'look at me, I'm cool' attutude. Not a lot in the way of smiles but plenty of unruly kids. The people at the Hualalai were more like 'I don't even have to try to be cool, that's for wannabees'. 4S Maui gets a 4.3 stars, rounded down to 4. Hualalai gets a 4.8, rounded up to 5. Again, nobody is completly perfect. And for more comparison, I give Princeville 4 stars, Kauai Marriott Lihue, 2 stars, Marriott Waiohai 3 stars (and that is generous, they just happen to have a great location and surrounding neighborhood.)    If you go, don't look at the bill, just order a burger and a lava-flow and soak it all in! room 2201",Dec 2005,July 2005,,,"Hudson, Massachusetts"
4230892,50,Spectacular - Will Definately Return,"Based on tripadvisor I planned what I thought was my dream vacation. 3 Nights at the Grand Wailea Maui, 6 nights at the 4S Maui and 4 nights at the 4S Hualalai. Had I known how spectacular the 4S at Hualalai truly is, I would never have gone to Maui and would have stayed the entire time on the Big Island. As a note, we did not stay at the 4S Maui as did not like the rooms, liked the Grand Wailea more than expected, and you can read my reviews under those categories.    But the 4S at Hualalai is simply incredible. We had an oceanfront room which I would recommend if can swing it. We also had the Bed and Breakfast package which was a terrific value. We were right on the ocean and from anywhere in the room, the bed, bath or the lanai, felt like we could touch the ocean. Even through closed blinds could still hear the crashing waves.    Breakfast was amazing everyday. Healthy if you want and if don't, lots to eat.    The view and feel of this resort is almost indescribable. Our pictures do not do it justice at all (I tried to attach one to this review but wouldn't work). The walk along the beach through each section of the hotel is wonderful with lots of seats to choose from. Most restaurants are right on the water as well. It's lush from one end to the other, the service was impeccable, the food excellent and the spa delicious. Not only would I recommend this resort to anyone, I will certainly return and intend to make a reservation again for next year.    I agree with all previous reviews that the noise between the rooms is more than would expect, but nothing that bothered us that much. If you haven't been here and want a relaxing vacation in a beautiful location, make your reservation now, you won't be disappointed.    We stayed at the resort for 5 nights, longer than expected (but now having been there not nearly as long as I would have liked) and didn't leave except to take the Blue Hawaiian Island Spectacular which wasn't spectacular at all and I would recommend saving your money. It so happened the lava shelf broke while we were on the Big Island and so we actually saw lava flowing which admittedly, that 10 minutes of the 2 hour tour was exciting. Other than that, we were not impressed at all.    All in all, fantastic resort and I thank all the reviewers on this site as I chose to stay here based on the incredible reviews. You were not wrong....and many thanks.",Dec 2005,December 2005,,,
4165278,50,Incredible Experience,"The Four Seasons Resort Hualalai is simply the best, most incredible resort my wife and I have ever stayed at in our lives. ""Understated luxury"" says it best. The grounds are beautiful, the rooms are wonderful and the food is really out of this world (and I am a very discriminating eater who typically does not like food at resorts).    We stayed in the Palm Grove section of the resort, which is very quiet. Our room was a ground floor, Ocean view with an outdoor shower in the back (very nice). We were able to sleep to the sounds of the Ocean, which is a real treat in my book. There also was a hot tub outside our room which we used very often (with a perfect view of the Ocean).    If you like to exercise, the gym facilities are incredible also - lots of machines, good classes (I took a spinning class which was very good) and if you like to run, there is a nice path along the Ocean which extends around the property (the paths are between 3 and 6 miles). There is nothing quite like jogging with the Ocean breaking against the Lava on one side and seeing the sparking green of the golf course on the other - really priceless.    We found the service to be very good also - very nice, very appropriate and definitely ""on"" most of the time. The other part that is appreciated is the lack of the ""extra"" charges. We have stayed at other resorts (e.g., Ikal del Mar in Playa de Carmen) where there is an absurd 15% service fee on top of the very high room rate. At Four Seasons, it is expensive, but your bill does not have surprises to it.    Finally, the Spa was also wonderful. Facilities are top rate and the massages are excellent.    Are the any problems? Yes, the walls are a bit thin and there were a couple of times when we heard our neighbors, but very little. One time we had to call to get our room made up at the end of the day.    But these were very minor issues. And all in all, this resort provided us with an experience we will not soon forget.",Dec 2005,November 2005,,,Philadelphia
4084637,50,The Four Seasons is a first rate resort...We loved it,"My husband and I just returned from 10 days at the Four Seasons Hualalai. Prior to booking our stay, I read nearly every review on this site, as well as many others, so I arrived with pretty specific expectations as well as a couple of potential concerns (which I was hoping would not materialize). This property is sensational in nearly every way that one would expect a property of this caliber to be. The site is beautiful, the resort is beautifully constructed and laid out and the rooms are well above average. The pools are incredible, with great views of the ocean and nice lounge chairs, umbrellas and cabanas. All the restaurants and bars are within feet of the beach and the ocean waves, allowing you to sit literally with your toes in the sand for an informal meal or drink if you desire. The least expensive golf/ocean rooms have great ocean views and do not face any streets or parking lots. They are well appointed, with walk-in closets and main floor rooms have the famous outdoor lava rock showers.    Having said all that, what really makes this an exceptional place is the incredible attention to customer service. From the moment you arrive at the airport until the time you drive off the property at the end of your stay, *everything* is taken care of for you. At the airport, a Four Seasons representative gets your luggage while you are sent off to get your rental car. At check-in, the process is quick and uncomplicated (and they are expecting you at the desk as well as when you go through the gate into the resort grounds). Whenever you need your car valeted, it is there within moments of your request. The service here is truly exceptional. Of special note is the pool staff. I cannot speak highly enough about the care and attention given to every guest at the pool. Set up on your lounge or cabana, water, sunscreen, cold towels, Evian spritzes, fruit, prompt food and drink service. It’s all there, and in a very low-key way. Absolutely the best I have seen in any setting.    To address some of the less positive things that are occasionally said in reviews on this site: I would have to agree that there is more room-to-room noise than you would expect. The first few nights of our stay, we did hear a baby crying at regular intervals during the night. Also, we had a couple of nights where the guests in the room above us were extremely disruptive. We chose not to call at the time (a mistake), but when we notified the resort manager, our issue was taken very seriously and remedied to our satisfaction (in fact, he personally visited us poolside to speak with us). Turn-down service was sporadic (in terms of happening much too late), but a call to housekeeping to request a specific timeframe is the remedy for this (in fact, I would recommend that you request a timeframe as soon as you arrive and this will never be a concern).    Food and drink are very expensive. But, this is The Four Seasons, and even though the food is expensive, it is also of extremely high quality. We never felt like we were being “ripped off”. Also, the property is somewhat isolated (it’s about 10 miles either direction to restaurants and shopping), but the good news is that the place is so incredible, you really don’t want to leave anyway!    The spa and fitness center are also excellent. All treatments are great, and there is no problem getting appointments (something that I’ve had issues with at other high-end resorts)    I whole-heartedly recommend this resort over anything else in the Islands (and I have stayed in some very nice places on Maui and Kauai). If you are looking for the ultimate vacation where you can relax, have your every need taken care of and never feel the need to leave an incredible, luxurious, but informal feeling resort, this is the place for you. We will most definitely make this a regular get-away from it all vacation. This place is expensive, and I don’t regret a single penny of the money we spent to stay there.    And, don’t miss the sea turtles on the beach and a visit to the Residents Beach House for great lunch and incredible drinks.",Nov 2005,October 2005,,,Seattle
4066004,50,Best ever,"I have stayed in nice hotels and resorts around the world, including several 4 Seasons properties, but I must say that this is the nicest that I have personally visited. This review is all the more remarkable because I was forced to travel to Hawaii and stay at the Four Seasons due to a wedding. I had no real desire to go, and was not happy about shelling out even the wedding rate.    The rooms are beyond fantastic. Every detail you could imagine (and several that I hadn't) is just nailed. From the high pressure outdoor showers, to the itty-bitty booklight by your bedside, to the L'Occitane toiletries, to the turndown service, to the stunning views, it is just perfect.    The service is 4 seasons through and through. In addition to the ""typical"" luxury pool side service (drinks, towels, magazines, etc.) they have people come around at various points to give you lemon scented cold towels, evian spritzes and clean your sunglasses.    Wildlife abounds -- during our stay a monk seal (only 150 left in the world) came up on the beach (during the wedding). Sea turtles, lizards, manta rays, fish, birds, etc. Amazing.    Food options are excellent. Ate in all the restaurants and never had a bad item, much less a bad meal. The daily breakfast buffet is outstanding and reasonably priced, relatively speaking. I also recommend the Residents' Beach club for lunch. Great casual spot.    The gym/spa facilities are the best I've ever seen. As good as any top notch gym in the U.S. Fantastic. Daily classes (spin, yoga, etc) are scheduled and very reasonably priced ($15). My wife loved them.    Business center offers free internet access, and while there is wireless for a fee in the rooms, we could not get a good signal. Cellphones and Blackberries work throughout the property no problem.    Golf course is solid, but other than the last 4 holes, not spectacular. If you are an avid golfer (I am -- single digit handicap), there are better options on the island in the price range ($190). That said, you can't really beat the convenience of rolling out of bed and being on the course. Also, if pace of play is an issue for you, the course gets relatively little play since it's open only to resort guests. We played in 4 hours or less each time -- with a full foursome.    All in all, the best hotel/vacation experience I've ever had, by a wide margin. My wife felt the same. I would go back and pay the rack rate without a second thought.

4042426,50,"ONE OF A KIND, EXPECT TO BE SPOILED","My husband & I just returned from a 10 day anniversary trip. The first 5 days were at this resort, and let me tell you, we got spoiled. Our 2nd 5 days were spent in Maui at the Grand Wailea (a disappointment after our stay here). The reason why they need your flight info is because they will have a rep at the airport waiting for you, and all you have to do is pick up your rental car (just around the corner) and he/she will pick up your bags for you. That was excellent! We have been to top-notch resorts but this place was excellent. They treat you like a celebrity, like you are not just a ""vacationer"" in the mix, but like you are their top priority. The service by the pool, at the beach bar, at the restaurants was 5 star.  If you're looking to go to a place where there's a lot of action, however, this is not the place. It is not surrounded by a lot of restaurants or close to shopping, as in Maui, but if you're looking for a place to relax, be pampered without pretense, meet fun people to have a nice dinner with or drinks on the beach, then this is your place.......if you have a decent amount of money to spend. We did spend twice the amount of money here than in Maui....but our experience was tenfold.",Oct 2005,October 2005,,,
4033212,20,Wouldn't do it again,"My wife and I went to this hotel to Honeymoon. We got married at the Four Seasons on Maui and LOVED IT!!! Now that was a great hotel. Since we were getting married at the Four Seasons, we didn't want to downgrade the quality of our stay. Hence we picked this hotel to stay at for our honeymoon.    Their service was mixed at best. They mixed up how many nights were were going to stay. They mixed up the time that we arrived even though we emailed it to them. They mixed up the time and date of our romantic dinner on the beach.    They knew that our flight arrived at 3pm and made a car reservation for 1pm. This lead to a hassle with Hertz (since the car came with the hotel package). Hertz gave us grief because we arrived late and didn't want to give us our convertible. We get that settled and get to the hotel.    The room and grounds are lush and wonderful. The room is nice looking BUT you can hear people in the rooms next door. I felt like I was back in college living in an apartment with thin walls. Except this is my honeymoon.    Nevermind the prices. It's already a ton of dough to get there. Then they want $4 for a can of soda. Yikes! All restaurants at the hotel are at least $30 per person not including wine or desert. So don't expect to come home with any cash left over. Not that I'm cheap. I just have to work for my money.    And don't try to find meals anywhere else around there. It's a 15 minute drive to the north to the next hotel and 15 minutes south to Kona. You are ISOLATED here. If you're into, great. If not, you're a hostage of the hotel.    On our last day at the hotel, we had to turn the car back in early. Evidently, it's a hotel policy to not let you have the car past the time you checked it out. Fine. Except that they cut us off by 2 hours when they booked the car at the wrong hour. Discusssion with the hotel staff did not go well either. This is the Four Seasons, not the Hampton. We expected much better customer service than what we got. They then expected us to pay for the taxi to the airport for $26 bucks. So more yelling ensued and they gave me a written letter stating that they would pay for the taxi. And now that I'm home, they billed me for the $26 bucks.    Don't expect to be able to swim in the ocean from the beach. The waterline is sand and then lava. Lots and lots of lava. To get out into the water, drive about 15 minutes north and there are public beaches. Not that this hotel doesn't have lots of pools. They even have one that is full of fish. But having gone in the ocean and seen fish in the ""wild"", swimming in their Kings Pond would be a let down.    Lastly, there are the people. This place contained some of the weirdest people I've seen on a tropical paradise. Maui had friendly happy people. This hotel felt like a business meeting. Unfriendly, unsmiling people. A lot of the them were on their way to workout. Or going to workout. Or coming back from working out and thinking about working out more. It's Hawaii for goodness sakes! And half of the people here are counting carbs, jogging, running and sprinting to gym. It made my wife and I feel lazy for not going to the gym when we're on vacation. It's a shame some people think they need to work constantly on vacation.    Bottom line, this hotel is not worth it! If you want a Four Seasons experience, go to Maui. Skip this one.

4031828,50,"""Big Island Utopia""","We spent a week here to celebrate my retirement from the NYPD, and what a celebration it was! When you drive up to ""heaven on earth"" the open view to the ocean is breathtaking. Valets (more than one) warmly greet you, and welcome you in pure Hawaiian style. At check in I was congratulated by the staff on my retirement, and given an upgrade to an ""ocean view room"". WOW!!! What a view! I stayed in room 2703 first level with an ouutdoor shower in the Palm Grove section. I highly recommend trying to get one of these rooms in this section. It was very tranquil, and there is a pool and a spa steps from your lanai. A stand with towels and ice cold water is always fully stocked although unattended.    The grounds of this resort are amazing, reminicent more of small village than a hotel property. The layout is planned out perfectly, and even though the hotel was at capacity it never felt like it. As other reviews state there are numerous pools (quiet, kids, snorkel, infinity) all fantastically maintained. The service at the pool areas are omnipresent (ice water, cold towel, sunglassess cleaning) an attendant was always there, almost by magic. They take notice of every little detail, and always address you by Mr. & Mrs. A great personal touch.    There is a walking/running path that runs along the oceanside of the property. Helpful maps are provided with running distances. Whenever you would approach any maintenance employee they would stop working and greet you with a smile as you passed by....these are the ""maintenance guys"" truly unbelievable. The fitness facility is top notch. There's a lap pool, and separate facilities for yoga, weights, cardio, a basketball court & rock climbing wall. The FS has everything! The spa was a little understated, but the massage was FANTASTIC! Thankyou Allison.    The restaurants are all very, very good. Especially Alan Wong's grill (ate there twice). The Mgt. at the FS is very professional & understanding. All of my questions & concerns were handled immediately, and to my complete satistfaction. With leadership so outstanding it's no wonder why every employee is all on the same page of execellence.    I can't wait to return. FIVE STARS *****",Oct 2005,October 2005,,,"Bronx, New York"
4031602,50,Heaven at Hualalai,"My husband and I visited Hualalai for a wk in September. After a very long trip we were very happy to find our room was available at 11am , I was even happier that they had granted our request of an outdoor shower - there really is no better way to start your day.  The resort is really spread out and incredibly peacful - there is never any problem in finding a sun lounger. The staff at the pool /beach are fabulous they literally never stop - they are always topping up your water, bringing fresh fruit or cleaning sunglasses. In my opinion it is at night that the resort is at it's most beautiful,It is lit solely by tiki torches and is so romantic.  The food is great and there is a huge choice -I would especially rec ' Alan Wongs' and the buffet breakfast.  The resort is expensive, but if you want a holiday you will never forget then do not hesitate to book !",Oct 2005,September 2005,,,london
4029548,20,honeymoon disappointment,"We just got home from our honeymoon. Despite reading some previous negative reviews on this site regarding the hotel's service, we decided to risk it. Afterall, what could be better than the Four Seasons?    We got married at the Four Seasons on Maui, about which I will write a separate review. That experience was AWESOME so our expectations were high. We did have a great time overall on our honeymooon (nothing could have ruined it for us) but we expected more from this particular hotel, especially for the price. There was a lot of confusion overall....    THE GOOD: The hotel is lovely. The rooms are spacious and clean. The ocean view is truly awesome. The amenitities are nice, such as being brought lunch on the beach, or complementary fruit kebabs/otter pops! It is romantic, despite all of the corporate types walking about- I have never seen so many men in polo shirts.    THE BAD: We first had trouble with this hotel when making reservations. The woman on the phone said she needed our flight information before she could even book us. When we called back they said that this wasn't the case. Whatever. No big deal. We made the reservation.    We booked a honeymoon package, not realizing that we would be nickled and dimed by such a prestigious resort. Breakfast costs about $27 per person and this was supposed to be included... We thought that is is tacky that the resort makes you pay for anything over $48 if you order through room service even if you do the honeymoon package. If you go to the buffet, then the cost is covered. We thought this was pretty cheap of them, especially because there was no forewarning. We had received only an e-mail confirmation of our arrival (which had the wrong dates on it but we fixed it), which neglected to give such details.    For our dinner on the beach, our menu was e-mailed to my husband three days before our arrival. Well, it was a honeymoon, so we were obviously in the process of getting married and didn't have e-mail access. Despite some worry on our part, the dinner did turn out well and we did get most of the items on the menu that we wanted. It just would have been smarter of them to send us the menu at least two weeks in advance, considering it doesn't change.    The third thing that bothered us was that they messed up our rental car package. We went to go pick up our car and were told by Hertz that the hotel said we would be there two hours earlier and they didn't know if they would have a car for us because WE were late. The hotel had our flight information and booked the wrong time for pick up. Also, we found out only by luck that the car had to be returned earlier on the day of our departure because of the hotel booking it incorrectly. Otherwise, we would be held liable for any late charges. No one ever told us this at the hotel or at Hertz. Anyway, we had to take a taxi to catch our plane home because of this and were stranded at the resort (albeit a pretty place to be stranded) for that entire day (we had to return our car at 1:00), as our plane didn't leave until 9 pm.    We visited the spa for a couples massage as part of our package. The staff members didn't show us the spa at all, just pointed us toward the locker room. I heard that there was a steam room and had to look around for it myself. It would have been nice if someone had guided me. There were also some jacuzzis, but I wasn't sure if they were coed and I had no swim suit. That might have been nice to know as well. The massage itself was really great, but the spa is more of a sports club than a spa. The exercise area looked nice.    Another thing that was disappointing was that many of the staff looked like they wanted to die. They looked depressed and angry, even when we tried to be nice. The exception was definitely the beach staff who seemed genuinely friendly.    We wish we would have done more research in regards to the hotels location. The beach is NOT swimable, just scenic. We drove to public beaches to go swimming. If you don't golf, I don't think that this is a good place to stay. It felt like it is in the middle of nowhere. We were tired after our wedding and didn't feel like driving 20-40 minutes every night for dinner, and the hotel food isn't great or cheap. Additionally, the food quality was inconsistent.    Next time, we would stay at the Four Seasons on Maui instead of this hotel. The service there was perfect and we felt like it was worth the money. I would highly recommend Maui for honeymooners and as a site for a wedding. We will never return to the Four Seasons Hualalai.",Oct 2005,October 2005,,,Texas
3984712,50,A new level of luxury for us...,"This is really IT! Yes it is really expensive, but they don't sneak a bunch of charges for towels and beach chairs, and the staff is top notch. They really want to work there, and should since the whole setting is indescribable. From bare lava rock to lush, beautiful gardens you will spend too much time taking pictures.    The breakfast buffet is ""off the chart"". The view of the ocean matches the super food options.  Don't go for the beach, but there are several pools with ocean views, some for families and others for adults. Our adult pool was ""attacked"" by a family with kids, but the pool attendant informed them and they left, issuing apologies to us ""oldies"".  Our room had a golf and ocean view and it was terrific. I'm afraid we will have to compare future trips to this property. A tough act to follow.",Oct 2005,September 2005,,,"Charlotte, NC"
3926286,50,Beautiful and Elegant - the best resort ever!,"My husband and I stayed at the Four Season Hualalai for 4 nights (our honeymoon) then we headed over to the Four Season Maui. We wished we stayed longer at the FS Hualalai! The hotel’s elegance and serenity is subtle at first, but I quickly fell in love with the beautiful grounds, the quietness, (but not a “sleepy”) hotel. Ask for a ground floor room –they have these incredible private outdoor showers. The rooms are large and the bathrooms are huge. Our ground floor room (golf view) faced the 18th hole, but you could see the ocean (with the sunset) in the distance. There was quite a bit of foliage, but it made our room more private. The pools are beautiful and the service wonderful. We also wish we spent more time at the beautiful tennis, spa, and lap pool area – if you want to get a little bit of exercise in, take advantage of some truly fantastic courts and gym. The hotel also has free washers and dryers with complimentary laundry soap. The crowd here is friendly honeymooners and the over 40 crowd (we’re 32). We enjoyed the friendly guests and liked that it wasn’t the collage crowd having a pool party.    The best restaurant is the Grill by Alan Wong – we ate at Pahu’ia and had a fantastic table looking right at the ocean (almost all tables have wonderful views). The food was just ok, Alan Wong’s was much better. We also did the Saturday night BBQ for $75 pp (doesn’t include alcohol). It was fun and the food selection was fantastic (lobster, steak, & chocolate soufflés). We sat at a community table on the beach. They do a great job, but I’m not sure if it’s a “must”. The food at the FS is very expensive ($18 for a glass of wine, $11 for tropical drinks) and we did get a little tired of shelling out so much $$, but we knew what we were in for. The memories and experience were worth the price.    Pools & beach: absolutely beautiful. We went just after labor day so it wasn’t too crowded….we never had a problem finding a chair. They will also set you up with chairs and an umbrella on the beach. The beach isn’t a place for boogie boarders or surfers, but the hotel is set right next to the beach and the sand and water are wonderful here.    Big Island activities: the island is a little sleepy and so much is covered in lava that it’s not as lush as Maui and it doesn’t have the fantastic beaches. We went just so we could relax at the FS Hualalai. We did however go on a hike to a huge crater (it’s like walking on the moon) and we took a great snorkeling trip through Four Winds sailing which I highly recommend. Take the morning trip and you may have to book out a week in advance.    All in all, we loved the FS Hualalai (better than FS Maui which is more of a typical “hotel”). The service is subtle and professional; the grounds are serene and beautiful - A perfect place for a romantic honeymoon. Next time we’ll just stay at FS Hualalai and not head over to Maui",Sep 2005,September 2005,,,"Seattle, WA"
3911200,50,pure paradise,Our first stop on this unbelieveable vacation was the Four Seasons Hualalai. I cannot say enough about this property!! We were 9 people which included 3 children and we all had the time of our lives. The rooms are pure paradise. Beautiful slate tile and that outdoor shower was breathtaking!! The service and staff were amazing. They were all bending over backwards for each one of us. The kids had a chance to snorkle with eagle rays and 2500 beautiful fish. We didn't want to leave. Our next stop was the maui four seasons which didn't hold a candle to hualalai!!,Sep 2005,September 2005,,,Dallas texas
3910751,40,A review for the dads out there,"I stayed at the Four Seasons in Kona for a week in September, 2005 with my wife and 18 mo old son. Here are my thoughts on our stay in no particular order:    - As I'm sure you are well aware, this place isn't cheap. You might be swabbling with your wife over the price. If you have kids and you're going in the summer this place is worth it. The A/C alone is worth it. You can get a cheaper room elsewhere but you're going to sweat your ----- off and trust me, when it's that hot out you'll shell out the extra bucks for good A/C any day of the week.    - The prices for food are, by any reasonable standard, outrageous. If you have a child like mine who eats 1/16 of his meal or suddenly doesn't like what he ordered after the food arrives, be prepared to deal with your frustration. Or better yet bring your own stuff that you know works. There is a K-Mart and Walmart not too far away; stock up there.    - When you hire a nanny and the nanny takes your kid to the pool make sure your nanny applies plenty of sunscreen and understands pool safety. Just a word of caution here; the nannies seem good although I didn't use one.    - If you plan on being with your kids during the day and you're at the pool be prepared to meet some nannies. More than a few parents dish their kids to a nanny for the day. I didn't want to spend time with nannies but on some days, I had no choice.    - If your child consumes milk then prepare for this before you arrive. You dont want to pay $4 for a glass of milk multiple times a day. Ask the hotel to buy a gallon for you and have room service deliver it (w/o charge) when you need it.    - While traveling with kids bring toys for the room, the pool and some DVDs.    - After labor day the place is empty. Before labor day there are fights for lounges around the pools.    - If you need a brainless day trip go to the Hilton to ride the tram/boats and see their dolphins. It's about 15 mins away by car.    - The closest Starbucks is at the Kings Shops near the Hilton. Hey, we all have needs.    - I suggest that the hotel put a canopy over part of the sand bottom pool to provide some shade for the kids while they are in the pool (it's difficult to get them out). Or at least cover the sandy beach part where the sand gets hot enough to burn feet.    - The baby pool with sand is simply amazing for the kids. We visited it multiple times a day and our son simply had a blast in there.    - Bring snacks for your kids. Ordering food can take a while if the hotel is busy and your kids may not like what they get.    - If you're a parent and you're not in shape dont worry. Few of the parents are. :)    - The rooms have Wayport 802.11 in it with a daily usage fee. I didn't see any wired Internet access.    - Behind the reception desk there is a computer lab with 3 Windows computers. The internet access is woefully slow. Cleverly the hotel has memory card readers so you can download your photos (and upload them somewhere since the computers dont seem to save files locally).    - The overall vibe of the hotel is friendly and not snooty. If your kid is screaming you're not frowned upon.    - I was amazed that the hotel doesn't go and buy the top 100 books on Amazon every summer and stock their poolside library with these titles. The hotel's book selection was awful. Bring your own.    - Along the same lines their poolside toy collection also sucked. The staff needs to inflate the toys every day and reinflate during the day. They have a pump behind the desk and they seem idle enough to take on this task. The hotel should also go buy new stuff once or twice a year at the local Walmart/Kmart. If you're a parent either bring something with you or go buy your own and leave it there when you're ready to leave.    - The menu at the adult pool is much better than the menu they offer around the sand bottom pool. But for some very odd reason the staff can't deliver the food to you; you have to go over to the adult pool and get it yourself. This is super lame for a hotel of this caliber.    - Cell service is strong around the hotel.    - The help is sometimes too visible. I got sick of seeing the gardeners and hearing their blowers every day. They need to hide the staff better like Aman hotels do.    - All in all this is a wonderful hotel esp if you have kids. The buffet is incredible. The staff loves kids and makes your feel welcome. The pools are great and fun.",Sep 2005,September 2005,,,CA
3894438,10,Terrible Service,"We chose this resort for our honeymoon based on the reviews and the golf course. What a mistake. We booked almost a year in advance. Due to some medical issues, we had to postpone our wedding and at our first booking, they were running a 5th night free special, which wasn't being offered during the time we had to postpone. We asked due to the circumstances if they would honor it, took our request all the way up to the hotel manager, and they refused. All the other resorts our guests were staying at since we married on Maui honored any original pricing/specials. This was the only resort that wouldn't.    When we arrived, we found the grounds to be very serene, however we walked into our room to find we were placed in a fishbowl. The room itself was very nice, however when opening the blinds, we were directly within steps of one of there pools, when we had specifically had our travel agent direct the resort this was our HONEYMOON and we wanted PRIVACY. We didn't want to open our blinds to have the world be able to see into our room. We called and asked for another room, to which we were told they could not accomodate this and were completely booked. We contacted our travel agent, and suddenly they were able to have a room ready for us, but not until the next night.    We went to dinner at their finer restaurant that evening. Due to the high winds, they did not have enough tables ready at the time of our reservation. They seated us in bar, however did not offer a complementary drink for our inconvenience and we had to wait 15 minutes for a waitress to even greet us, and another 15 to be served. Once seated at the table, we weren't even given menus, and had to wait another 5 minutes for a waiter! My husband's shrimp were both tough and chewy. For the price you pay at a fine dining restaurant, you expect both service and excellent cuisine. We received neither, nor a ""thank you"" or ""have a good evening"" as we exited the restauarant.    Though the golf course is absolutely spectacular and one of the finest in the United States and the activities/grounds of the Four Seasons Hualalai are unique, their service is terrible, the rooms are very pricey, and we would never stay at this resort again. We will try the updated Sheraton or one of the other resorts further up the Kona coast next visit to the Big Island.    As we stayed on 4 islands, and 4 top rated resorts in Hawaii during our honeymoon, the Four Seasons Hualalai was the biggest disappointment and made that portion of our honeymoon miserable with their inexcusable service.",Sep 2005,September 2004,,,"Chicago, IL"

The setting was exquisite. The food at the restaurant on the Golf Course (I think it's called The Grill by Alan Wong) was superb.    It was one of the few places that I'd splurge on again.

Two nights the bed wasn't turned down until 9:00pm. One morning the room wasn't cleaned until 3:00pm. Poolside lunch took 45 min to arrive, and twice they mixed-up our orders. Beach BBQ was way over booked, could not even get a reservation. On the checkout day, we were told that if we hang around the hotel, we could use the showers in the sports club. On arriving at the sports club, then only be told that children under 14 were not allowed to use it due to some local state laws.

3793437,50,Beautiful island destination,"My first time visiting this hotel was in May for a wedding. After spending three days here as a visitor, I knew I had to convince my husband to switch our vacation plans from Cancun to the Big Island!    The purpose of our visit was to celebrate a belated honeymoon that we never took when we married 8 years ago. This hotel was a wonderful place to go for a romantic and luxurious trip.    That said, we were surprised (pleasantly so) to find that this hotel resort is very family oriented! We instantly missed our kids who stayed back home and we plan to bring them along next time. They'll enjoy this vacation more than the planned Walt Disney World vacation we were intending for '06!    In all fairness, I agree with previous posters that the rooms aren't as soundproofed as they could be. Also, if children are a bother, this may not be a pleasant resort during popular family vacation months.    For the price paid ($725/night) the general atmosphere is surprisingly causal and unpretentious.    After staying here and seeing the family-oriented atmosphere first hand, we've booked a stay at the Aviara resort in San Diego!",Aug 2005,August 2005,,,Northern California
3788732,50,The best hotel in Hawaii,"My wife and I stayed here for 6 nights and booked a first floor room (2801) (for the outdoor shower option) in the Palm Grove section as it was the quietest portion of the property. The view from our room was of the ""adults only"" Palm Grove pool and of the ocean in the background (all rooms in the Palm Grove are in the ocean view category). The room was exactly as shown on their website but with the addition of the outdoor garden and shower via another glass door in the bathroom shower.    From the doorman, the free valet (they stock your rental car with water and will provide towels if you need them offsite) the housekeepers, and waitstaff, the service here is unmatched. They will stock your refrigerator with whatever you want and you can specify when you want housekeeping and turndown service each day.    Restaurants:  Alan Wongs Hualalai Grill - excellent food and a view of the 18th hole of the golf course was incredible.  Pahuia - excellent breakfast buffet along the beach (look for the baby shark in the lagoon under the walkway to the entrance) - did not eat dinner here though.  Residents Beach House - the most affordable food at the property at the 18th tee box  Beach Tree Bar & Grill - great location (ask to sit at one of the tables on the adjacent beach) and food second most affordable.  In room dining is excellent as well - Ask them to set a table for you on you lanai or patio for a great sunset dinner. They suggested this to us on our last night.    Spa and Sports Club:  Used the free facilities every day. Separate buildings (cardio, free weights and machines, fitnesss clases) surrouding the spa pool with excellent locker rooms and staff. There is something scheduled every hour from 7:00 am till 6:00 pm. Check out the rock climbing wall, tennis and basketball courts as well.    Golf:  The best course conditions on the island and open only to guests. Tee times are spread out every 20-30 minutes so you are never rushed. They take care of your clubs and shoes the moment you arrive at the resort. Carts are stocked with water, tees, towels and the beverage attendant is always around every couple of holes to make sure your clubs are cleaned, ice is replenished and drinks available. Practice facilities are extensive and free golf clinics are regularly scheduled during the week.    Pools:  Palm Grove - mostly adults, couples - small heated simple round pool and elevated jaccuzzi - very quiet and no cell phones allowed.  Beach Tree - most popular infinity pool - excellent pool side service and beachfront jaccuzzi  Seashell - best for families - large pool along beachwalk and sand bottom pool for kids as well.  Kings Pond - wild - swim with Manta Rays and thousands of fish in huge coral bottom pool. Fewer lounge chairs and we found the ocean water warmer than the Kings Pond.  All pools have free cabanas and cushioned lounge chairs. Lots of lounges on the beach as well where attendants will see to your comfort.    Read the reviews, look at the website and see the videos on the travel channel and you will see why this hotel is the number one hotel in all of Hawaii.

3750240,50,Like no place on earth!,"My husband and I stayed here last April for our honeymoon, and it was everything we could have wished for. We spent the first two days of our honeymoon at the Mauna Lani down the street, and this was a definite step up! The staff was courteous and helpful, the grounds were immaculate, and our room was spectacular (they provide complimentary bath and body products from L'Occitane, which was an added treat)! We splurged and got an ocean view room on the second floor, but I couldn't imagine that there would be a bad room in the place. All of the rooms are in two-story bungalows, so it's like staying in an ultra-luxurous beach house! The beach is not good for swimming, but we saw many sea turtles while lounging on our beach chairs. We had the breakfast buffet every morning-it was good, but nothing to write home about. Alan Wong's restaurant on the property is phenomenal though, and is a must if staying there. We've stayed at the Four Seasons Wailea on Maui, and it does not even compare to Hualalai!

3746990,50,Heaven on earth...,"Any reviews of this hotel that make it out to be much short of heaven on earth should be taken with a grain of salt. My husband and I went to Hualalai for our honeymoon in June and had the most fabulous time imaginable! We had spent 4 nights at Princeville before arriving and while the bellman was driving us around Hualalai on a golf cart for our introductory tour, I almost cried because I was so sad we went to Princeville at all. If you are going to more than one location, definitely come here last! The stark contrast between the jet black lava rock and the lush greenery and bright florals against the blue sea was magnificent. The hotel was at capacity during our stay yet you would never know. The beautifully appointed and serenely decorated rooms are set up so that you always feel a sense of privacy and seclusion. The adult pool stayed quiet and peaceful while kids were having a blast further away at the family pool. As long as you make dinner reservations past 7:30ish, you will miss most children. The breakfast package is a MUST... fabulous food and a bargain considering what you get for it. There is so much to do from snorkling to tennis to spa services and golf... not to mention the rock climbing wall and full service, state-of-the-art gym, you never have to leave. The staff was lovely and doting and the food at all four restaurants was top notch. Be sure to attend the BBQ night on the beach. They offer a fabulous spread beachside where you can watch the stars and grill marshmellows fireside. I will never forget the evenings my husband and I spent sipping champagne alone on the beach, watching the most amazing sunsets we've ever seen. I have never dreamed and yearned to be back at a place as I do Hualalai!!",Aug 2005,June 2005,,,"Atlanta, GA"
3740908,50,bliss!!!,I could go on about everything wonderful about this resort...The way they greet you when you check-in with cold towels and guava juice and a lei greeting or how warm the staff is and of course the food especially Alan Wongs Hualalai Grille (Get the 7 course chefs tasting menu) or the outdoor lave rock shower off the indoor shower in the room or the amazing pool service or the immaculate grounds but truly it's in the way you feel when you are there the little touches that melt away your stress!! this resort will change you forever and all you will do is wait to go back and when you are there you'll never want to leave the resort as we found to be true with all the other people we met there!!!,Aug 2005,July 2005,,,las vegas
3696251,10,Beware!!!,"Beware, they have a 21 day cancelation policy which we were not informed of when we made our reservation. We tried to cancel 18 days before our scheduled trip and they would not refund our money. They were not nice to deal with, I even asked if they could just charge us for our room and not the golf portion or brekfast and they said no they couldn't break it down. Well they had no problem breaking it down for me when I made the reservation, but not if your trying to cancel. I am out $1045, and will never think of staying at this resort again! Next time we will get travel insurance through an agent!",Jul 2005,,,,California
3662235,50,One of the best in the world,We've been here twice and consider it one of the best resorts in the world. The service and restaurants are heavenly. The setting is spectacular. The golf course is excellent. Worth every penny. The only negative is that there can be a lot of children around during school breaks if this is a negeative for you.,Jul 2005,September 2004,,,"Los Angeles, CA"
3661741,50,Finest resort anywhere,"My wife and I have stayed at top-flight resorts all over the world, but Hualalai is absolutely our favorite. We've been several times, and there is absolutely nothing to compare to the atmosphere, facilities and service. Even at peak times, when the resort is filled to capacity, it never feels crowded, and the staff are unfailingly warm and accommodating (several have remembered us from prior trips and greeted us by name). As someone else said, the word ""no"" doesn't seem to be part of the staff's vocabulary.    The rooms are tasteful, spacious and comfortable, with large bathrooms and closets. I prefer the lower rooms with the outdoor showers. The beds are extremely comfortable.    The rooms are located in 4 basic areas. The Palm Court (near the golf clubhouse) is the quietest and tends to have the fewest kids. We like to stay in the King's Pond area, where our children have close access to the Kids For All Seasons (complimentary children's program), snorkeling pond and Seashell Pool.    The pools are great, well maintained with extremely attentive staff. There are plenty of poolside cabanas and chairs, and getting a drink or lunch by the pool is easy and enjoyable (albeit not inexpensive).    The resort does a remarkable job of accommodating families (the complimentary kids program, free game room, free videos, kids menu at all restaurants, etc.) while maintaining a calm and peaceful atmosphere for adults. Part of it is that the resort is so spread out that families with kids tend to congregate in certain areas, and part of it is that the kids' program does a great job keeping many of the little ones occupied during the day. There are a number of little touches that everyone (but especially families) will appreciate, such as numerous free washer and dryer facilities scattered inconspicuously among the guest rooms.    The fitness center is fabulous. Facilities and service are first-rate, with separate buildings for cardio, weights, and spinning/aerobics classes, plus a lap pool and beautiful locker rooms. The attached spa is also wonderful, as is the nearby tennis center. For those who play golf, there is a Jack Nicklaus course which is fun and not overly challenging (and because it is limited to resort guests and homeowners, it does not get too crowded).    The restaurants are excellent. The Hualalai Club Grille (Alan Wong's restaurant at the golf clubhouse) is our favorite. Pahui'a is also nice, especially for adults (save room for the dessert souffles). The breakfast buffet is mind-boggling, but is not cheap. Ditto the evening buffets that are regularly held twice or three times per week.    One of our favorite places to enjoy an appetizer and drinks is the Residents' Beach Club, which is technically not part of the hotel but adjoins it (near the Palm Court). Beautiful, casual setting with friendly staff, and you can charge to your room.    There are really only 2 downsides to this place. The first is the lack of a real beach. The second, of course, is the price tag. This place is really, really expensive. But if you are willing and able to deal with that, Hualalai is a truly amazing place to spend time.",Jul 2005,April 2005,,,"Novato, CA"
3659208,50,Honeymoon Haven,"The Four Seasons lived up to all the good posting on the website. It even exceeded it in some cases. The staff was awesome, very helpful. Conceirges gave good recommnedations, but were not overly pushing towards certain places. The service is impeccable by the pool, especially the ""quiet pool."" This was the best, no mobile phone conversations allowed and young kids are sent to the ""kids pool."" Cabanas are first come, first serve. However, there are tons of umbrellas. They even have sunscreen at the service desk in case you forget yours or need to reapply. There is a book rack with several soft back books and hardbacks left behind by other guests. Magazines and NY Times fax supplement are available at the service desk, as well. When I say service desk, it is right by the pool tow of them in fact.    Getting back to the service by the pool. In the morning, after seating you they bring ice cold water with a hint of lemon and refill your water all day long. If you are there before 10:30 am you even have fresh fruit served to you. Chilled mint hand towels are brought around several times during the day with Evian spritizer. They even come around at least once asking to clean your sunglasses. As I said, this is routinely done during the day. They will hold your seats from 11:30am-2:30pm so you can venture off for lunch. In the afternoon (around 2:30 or 3pm) they serve ""Otter pops"" (aka popscicles) Drink service starts at 10, ends at sunset, food service starts at 11, ends at 4 pm.    Well, I have to call it an evening, but will continue with the rest of the review later in the week. My wife almosted started crying when she read the review over my shoulder...asking when are we going back? It is an excellent choice and well worth the expense.",Jul 2005,,,,"Raleigh, NC"
3605150,50,Great Resort!,"We stayed at the Four Seasons from June 10-14. I've stayed at a few other Fours Seasons and Ritz Carltons, and this is the nicest resort that I've been to. The service, facilities and restaurants were excellent. Unlike some resorts, they don't nickel and dime you for extras. The outdoor showers were great. The Saturday night buffet was outstanding and we also had a great dinner at Alan Wong's Hualalai Grill.    Housekeeping was marginal. They generally didn't clean our rooms until 3:00 or 3:30. I noticed that one of the recent reviews mentioned that you're supposed to schedule housecleaning. If that's true, we were also unaware of it as it was never mentioned to us. That might explain why they came so late everyday.    They will also deliver newspapers to your room but you have to ask - they don't voluntarily tell you about it.    We got a little burnt out on the high restaurant prices, particularly at lunch. My daughter ordered a hot dog and Coke for lunch for a total cost of $17 or so. I don't mind paying the higher prices at dinner, but I resent having to pay such prices at lunch.    We stayed in two of the cheaper rooms on the golf course and were very happy with them. Prior to arrival I considered changing to the more expensive pool-side rooms as the golf course rooms looked like they were pretty far away. (I couldn't change because the place was sold out.) The golf course rooms weren't that far from the pools and we're pretty convenient to certian parts of the resort. Unlike the other areas, you could park behind the rooms so that you didn't have to deal with valet parking and could pack the car more easily when leaving. I would definitely stay in the same rooms if I returned.    I think this is probably the first place I've been that had free washers, dryers, and detergent. The laundry areas are located throughout the resort and you rarely have to wait to use them. If you don't mind doing some laundry on vacation, you can cut back on the amount of clothing that you need to pack.    Another nice touch is the empty mini-bar. We went to a nearby Safeway and stocked it with beer, milk, etc.    My kids were disappointed that the only internet access was at the business center which was desgnated for ""adults only."" Apparently, the game room used to have computers for kids but they were recently removed.    The place is somewhat isolated. The Koahla area is about 15 minutes away and has good restauants and shopping. Kona is about 20 minutes away. I highly recommend the Kona Brewery which has great beer and pizza, and is a heck of a bargain compared to resort prices.",Jun 2005,June 2005,,,Pittsburgh
3554713,10,Don't waste your money at the Four Seasons Hualalai,"Our stay at this hotel was very disappointing. At these prices we expected extra special treatment and top notch service. There were crumbs in my 9 year old son's bed when he went to get into it. It was a fold out sofa that obviously had not been freshly made. After a night of crunchy sleep we realized that the plastic covering on the mattress had not been torn off! The supposed ""complimentary"" kids club was full of hidden costs for extra activities and room service priced lunch! The worst part was that the staff was just going through the motions with no warmth or personal service. After paying $600 per night we felt ripped off. If you are looking for an elegant hotel with warm Hawaiian service stay at the Mauna Kea Beach Hotel. We spent 3 nights there prior to the Four Seasons. I wish we had never left.",Jun 2005,June 2005,,,"Alpharetta, Georgia"
3526886,50,Best Service in the World,"Our recent trip to the Four Seasons, Hualalai started with a disappointing arrival. I own a travel agency and we've visited several other islands before. We are used to seeing the lush green flowering foliage of Kauai. I'd heard that when you land on the Big Island, be prepared to feel as if you are in a scene from Road Warrior! The runway is surrounded by lava fields.    The Hualalai Resort area features the #1 in the World Rated golf course at the hotel and is an immaculately manicured carpet of greens divided by fields of black lava. All rooms are in individual bungalows, approx. 9 to each area: The Palm Grove, Family Pool (the infinity pool in most pictures), adult pool area and King's Pond stocked with several thousand fish where you can snorkel.    After arriving at the hotel we were escorted to our room, an ocean view in the Palm Grove area. The rooms are wonderful with large showers and huge soaking tubs, marble vanities and lots of amenities. The beds are deep pillow tops with linen sheets. Our lanai looked out over a thicket of palm trees with one tiny rock enclosed pool (which no one used the whole time we were there) and a similar jacuzzi. The grass, trees and hedges needed attention. The grass looked brown and filled with weeds in spots, which was a shock to see after seeing the golf course and other areas.    The family pool and adult pool areas were wonderful. I can't say enough about the employees, who greet you each and every time they pass. No one will point the way to anywhere but escort you there themselves. No one says the word ""no"" ever! If something can't be provided, they pass you on to a supervisor who usually tells you they'll see what they can do. I told one of the employees at the cabanas that I missed Lilikoi Pie and he told us to go to the Beach Tree Grill and ask them to make me one! I laughed. He then told me he was serious!    Poolside there are enough chairs and cabanas for everyone. No cell phones allowed at the pools or spa and everyone complied and stepped away if they needed to make calls. Cabanas are free as is equipment, laundries are provided in each area, well kept, stocked with everything you need and free also. At the pool you will be offered, at no charge, cold scented towelettes, fruit, spritzes with iced evian water, books and magazines, popsicles and sunglass cleaning. The poolside menus are different depending on whether you are in the adult or family area.    I was reading a People magazine with a picture of a celebrity who had just gotten married. They were sitting in the deckchair two down from us. They got total privacy the whole time they were there. Employees and guests alike treated them just like they were anyone else, which I'm sure was the reason they were there.    At Four Seasons there are no club levels, no special areas for VIPs. All guests are treated with the same spectacular service.    Food was wonderful at each of the 3 restaurants. The Beach Tree Grill Serves all day with 2 special buffets during the week. We enjoyed the Seafood Barbeque, a fabulous buffet on the beach. They had all you can eat lobster, clams, crab, steaks, and other entrees, with salads, breads, island desserts as well as international desserts, plus a small bonfire and table laden with ingredients for making S'Mores. There is an Italian Buffet on Wednesdays.    Hualalai Grill featuring Chef Alan Wong was our favorite restaurant, which serves Hawaiian and Asian fusion foods. Dress and atmosphere is golf casual but throughout the resort, ""casual"" means nice slacks and Hawaiian or golf shirts. Lunch is also served. All three restaurants are open to the exterior on three sides. Pahu i'a was their fine dining restaurant, serving a great buffet breakfast in the morning (buy the Bed & Breakfast package...it's a better deal than buying breakfast separately). In the evening you can feast on seafood specialties and especially Moi, which a native Hawaiian will catch for your meal personally in the pond next to the restaurant.    Room service is round the clock. You can customize your minibar, but do this on the first day. Housekeeping comes within minutes of any call. Turndown service is available each night.    The fitness facilities are spectacular with everything you can imagine in open air bungalows with lots of state of the art equipment and fitness classes. They also have a nice sized outdoor climbing wall with instructors and full court basketball. There is a Kids for All Seasons club and the resort offers kid sized robes and toys in the room as well as hot cocoa, popcorn and home made cookies in the room.    The spa was the only place I had criticism. The lady who did my Ayurvedic massage seemed to be in a hurry. I've done this massage before and she was way to fast. At one point she snapped at me to ""relax!"" and yanked on my foot.    The prices are over the top but worth it if you can afford it. There are other resorts in the islands that charge close to what one room here costs, but they nickel and dime you on the amenities. Here we estimated we received nearly 200.00 a day in freebies which we've paid for at other so called luxury resorts.    I recommend it. Pick any other area but the Palm Grove with the canopy of palms that cover the area cutting out all sunlight. Kids here were the best mannered I'd ever seen on vacation. Parents were attentive and great with their kids. If a baby cried in a restaurant, they were comforted or taken out, not ignored and left screaming. No cell phones rang or were used inappropriately. It was a quiet, relaxing environment. Everyone was very nice to each other and with employees who went beyond expectations in being helpful and polite. A lovely place to visit.",Jun 2005,,,,"Phoenix, Arizona"
3513563,10,NOT WORTH THE MONEY-LOUSY SERVICE,"We spent 4 nights at 4 Seasons for our honeymoon, and I deeply regret choosing this resort for our honeymoon. We paid $700 a night +tax for an ocean view room. The room was nice, but it is not worth $700 per night. The reason 4Seasons charge this much money, is because they supposed to provide a very high level of service and a worry-free vacation. This resort provides a very low level of service at par with a motel. We requested an ocean view room in a quiet area, and when we arrived we were shown to a room directly in front of hot-tub, where people were relaxing and drinking beer. I asked for another room, since I wanted to have an ocean view room, and not hot-tub, empty beer bottles view.  I was told by the front desk that they had no other rooms available, but we could upgrade to an ocean-front room for $810 per night or golf-view room.  I asked to speak to a manager, and the manager told me the same thing - no ocean -view rooms available. I told the manager that it is unacceptable to pay $700 per night and look at empty beer bottles, and that I am going to check out and go to Hilton, where for about $350 per night I will get much better service, and will not have hot-tub/empty beer bottles view.  At this point, the manager told me that she had several other ocean-rooms available. We moved to a very nice room. This entire process took several hours.  The next day the room was not cleaned by 1:30pm, and had to call housekeeping to get it cleaned. They told me that I had to schedule cleaning. No one advised me that I had to schedule my room cleaned at 4Seasons, otherwise appearantly they clean it late, if at all.  The next day passed without incident, however on our last day we called at 10:00am to request a late checkout (we asked for en extra hour). We were told that we had to check out on time (1:00pm), because there was another guest arriving. We asked to speak to General Manager, and we told that all managers were busy in meetings. We recieved a call at 12:00pm that our checkout was extended by 30 minutes. Getting a late checkout at 12:00pm was too late since we were ready to check out already.  We spent over $3000 for 4nights, and for this money we expected to get seamless service and worry free vacation. Instead, we had hustles, and lousy service. Everytime we asked for something, we either did not recieve it at all, or had to spend time and effort to get it.  I wrote a letter re this incident to Isadore Sharp, President of 4 Seasons, asking if the level of service we received was the 4Seasons standard, and he responded that since we booked our room in January 2005, the hotel did the best they could to accomodate us. Since, this is a very popular resort, the repeat guests reserve rooms in advance, and therefore it was hard to honor our room request. Also, they are unable to provide late check-out since the resort is so busy. According to Mr. Sharpe's letter it appears that 4Seasons caters to repeat customers over one time customers.  What kind of customer service policy is that ? Especially at $700 per night.  THIS RESORT IS SIMPLY NOT WORTH THE MONEY.",May 2005,April 2005,,,"Atlanta, Georgia"
3455042,50,Amazing! Aloha Spirit at it's best!,"We live on Maui, and have stayed at lots of hotels throughout the islands, and this one was by far, the best. Everything about it was wonderful. Definitely the most Polynesian we've been to! Maui is getting kinda of vegas style with all it's huge waterfall/marble lobbys, etc...This place was heaven. It was sooooo quiet! All we ever heard all week were the birds chirping, and the waves. So beautiful! The staff was so nice and full of Aloha spirit, we couldn't believe it. The property is obviously maintained beautifully, by far the cleanest place we've been to. The amenities were great, the food was great. They even have free laundry facilities! We got to come home with clean clothes! The pools were fantastic, the King's pond was really fun and cold to say the least! We enjoyed walking all the paths. We also appreciated the fitness rooms, and spas. Free cabanas too! On Maui you have to rent cabanas for $150 a day! We really like the fact that there was a regular priced little store for sundries, and not a bunch of junk in the minibar. We ate almost every meal at the Beach Tree Grill. Also, if you don't want to hear children, just go to the adult pool. We don't know what people are talking about with the kids, we never heard any, and there were lots. Very romantic, special and magical place. Definitely going again, and we are for sure bringing our 1 yr old and 4 yr old. We were very suprised how kid friendly they made it. Amazing experience. You will not regret staying there, especially if you want to experience a real classy polynesian hotel.",May 2005,May 2005,,,maui
3436150,50,Paradise in Kona,"My husband, my daughter and her friend as well as myself stayed at the Four Season Resort in Kona. When we were driving up to the resort from the airport, I have to admit that I was a little skeptical as to what the resort was going to look like. When are arrived at check-in I couldn't believe how beautiful the facilities were. I'm an orchid lover and there were so many arrangements with spectacular species in them and the staff was extra-ordinarily helpful. Our check-in was brief and we headed to our room. Oh my...when we walked into our room I was so at peace. The room looked out to the trees and the pool, which was really close to the ocean. When I looked at the entire room, I noticed the bathroom. The staff had a big welcome in there and managed to spell each of our names with sponge letters. They even had one for our 2-year-old son who wasn't with us. I began to weep a little. I was so happy to be there but wished he would be with us too. This resort used the very best products I've ever used in a hotel/resort; they supplied us daily with L'occitane shampoo, conditioner and soaps. Once we walked through the bathroom, I noticed there was an outdoor shower - I could believe my eyes! The shower was built with black lava rock and was total private but allowed you to still that sense of being outdoors. On the ground of the shower were MORE orchids. Needless to say, I took showers in there at least once a day. I was even lucky enough to meet the grounds keeper who knew tons about orchids. Since we were visiting on a business trip, our daughter and her friend we're always allowed to participate in the planned events. The staff again was wonderful. They would pick the girls up at their room and take them to the restaurant of their choice and return them when they were done. They felt so independent and of course very special :-) One night my husband called the restaurant to ask if they served fettuccine with alfredo sauce. The gentlemen said they didn’t make it at their restaurant but that he would be willing to go to a local restaurant to get necessary ingredients and make some for the girls. He did exactly that and the girls we so happy. The cultural center became the girls second home so to speak. The made friends with all the people there and even wrote to them when they returned home to California. I would strongly recommend ANYONE to vacation at the Four Seasons in Kona. You won’t go wrong and you will create the most awesome memories of a lifetime. We’re still talking about it. Can’t wait to return!!!",May 2005,,,,"Pleasanton, CA"
3435332,50,Paradise!!,"The Four Seasons was evrything I had hoped it would be! The rooms were very clean, luxurious, and the outside shower was amazing!! The resort was peaceful and quiet with beautiful scenery. All of the the staff were extremley nice and made us feel like celebrities on our stay. The spa and workout facilites were top notch without a doubt. We celebrated our 10 year wedding anniversary at the Four Seasons and I can't wait to go back again.",May 2005,April 2005,,,California
3428274,50,Outstanding Resort on Kona,"My wife and I just returned from the Four Seasons resort on the Kona caost of the Big Island. Although we were there for a corporate conference and weren't footing the bill (thank goodness), I still found it to be among the most pleasant resort experiences I've ever had. It would be hard to imagine a more beautiful resort. It's quite spread out, even though there are not a ton of rooms, and it's hard to believe how many staff they throw at the place and at the guests. The rooms were gorgeous. We were lucky enough to have learned from this site to request a ground floor room with outdoor lava rock shower (what a treat!). We were also in the Palm Grove section, which is nice and quiet. The golf course is unbelievable nice. The walking road along the perimeter of the hotel is incredibly beautiful to walk in the early morning, etc. They also have an exceptionally beautiful and almost soulful cultural centre. I spent a few minutes there (not enough) just before leaving for the airport. In short, the whole place is outstanding. The only comment I would make is that if I were going there with my kids, I know they would find it a bit limiting and quiet. Plus, although sections of the beach are quite swimmable, it's not as beach-friendly as some other resorts. In my opinion, the Four Seasons hotel on Maui is better suited for kids, and this one is a more romantic, couples experience. If you can afford it, go. If you can really afford it, go and stay for a good long time. We ran into one couple in their 60's who had been there for three months! Must be nice.",Apr 2005,,,,"Toronto, Canada"
3316823,50,The best on earth,"My husband and I went to this FS property for a part of our honeymoon - the other part at the FS on Maui, and all I can say is that it was the best. We have traveled to many different top resorts, and this one was worth the steep price - every dime. The service was outstanding - from the moment we landed at the airport to the moment we were dropped off, the service was excellent, the food was unbelievable, the spa was out of this world - we left the resort one day to visit the volcano and didn't see the need to leave again. The food was so good - down to the private butler dinner on the beach. The FS Maui was great - but was missing the charm of this location. We'll definitely be going back!",Mar 2005,September 2004,,,New Jersey
3315537,40,Wonderful especially when you compare it to others!,"We recently came back from spending 5 days at this resort. We liked it from the beginning, but we liked it even better after we traveled to other supposedly 5 star hotels in other islands that were shameful! You don't fully appreciate it until you see other standarts. Anyway, we had an executive suite with a wonderful location right in front of the King pond. Who ever thought of having this pond with hundreds of fish to snorkel, was a genious. This was beautiful! Also, I recommend the spa. The signature treatments particularly the stone massage was out of this world. The facilities at the SPA may not be as impressive, but the treatment and personnel make up for this. As for the children, I agree with many other reviewers, there were many, this is a family resort because of the great kids programs they have; however, if you go to the adult or the quiet pool and beach areas you won't even feel they are there. We did that as the teen pool was too loud and the problem was fixed. Concierge service was great and I strongly recommend the helicopter ride with the landing in the waterfall! It was a real treat and the highlight of the entire trip. Regarding restaurants at this resort, I say the best value but also the best taste for us was their beach grill! We tried both of their ""upscale"" restaurants and really they were not out of this world. For the money you pay and the quality you get, you may stay with the beach grill that has beautiful location and is pretty nice even for nice dinner. Also, I don't recommend their famous Friday seafood buffet, it is too expensive and really not worth it. Because it was sold out we thougth it was going to be pretty good and we couldn't miss. We waited for the only reservation that was open at 8:00, we were starving and it was really not all that worth it. Also, the food at the pool and beach is great! There is an overall awareness for healthy, organic and non-fat food, so the meny is great if you don't want to gain weight. I also recommend that you walk or run in the morning the jogging trail (a map is provided in your room). The views of the sea with the black rock is so good to the spirit. Overall, we will certainly be back here, and after we've been all over the world, at some of the best hotels, I must say ""you CANNOT go wrong with FOUR SEASONS"" (Except London one!) they know what luxury tourism is all about. In addition, tip, if you are a centurium member of the American Express, they give you the real red carpet!  Have fun  Luz",Mar 2005,March 2005,,,"Houston, Tx"

3277265,50,Another Glowing Review of Paradise,"My husband and I hit the Four Seasons at the tail end of an 8 day trip to the island, after spending time at the Hapuna Beach Prince.    We usually don't splurge on expensive resorts as we don't end up spending enough time at the resort or in the room to justify the cost. This time, since the 4S Hualalai is consistenly rated as one of the best hotels in the world - we made an exception. And boy are we glad we did!! Our only regret is not staying at the 4S for the entirety of our trip!    Service, Comfort and Quiet Elegance are the key here. Although the hotel was completely full - we always felt like we were the only ones there. From the moment we drove up to the moment we drove away we were impressed by each and every aspect of the 4 Seasons.    We had a Golf-Oceanview room (we could see the ocean across the 18th hole of the course). We requested a bottom floor room since I had read that they have extra outdoor showers. It was wonderful to take an evening shower outdoors amongst the tall plants and volanic stones.    Updside:  Rooms - Quite Large rooms, linens and towels and robes are super soft, toiletries are wonderful (L'Occitane), DVD player (check out complementary dvd rental library in business center) and an empty fridge, toaster and coffee maker. They give you a ""menu"" from where you can pick and choose items to be stocked in your fridge. And believe it or not, everything is reasonably priced (for a hotel that is). My advice is drive up to Waimea Foodtown and stock your own.    Service - Everything is at your finger tips. Ask for it, its there when you want it. Poolside, water refills, evian spritz, cold towels and sunglass cleaning all day long. Free ice-pops at the kids pool, fruit at the others.    Amenities - 4 Pools, 4+ restaurants, complementary snorkel gear, walking and running paths galore, shops and galleries, what more can one ask for!    Price - Yes the rooms are expensive, but worth every penny. We did find that food/bev/activities were actually cheaper (if not free) at the 4S than at the other hotel we stayed at. So all in all, you may not be paying that much more afterall!",Mar 2005,March 2005,,,"Scottsdale, Arizona"
3231086,50,Paradise,"First impression:    Husband and I went to Hawaii for our honeymoon. We arrived at the Kona airport after a full day of traveling around 8:30PM, February 15. To our surprize there was a guy from the Four Seasons standing outside the terminal holding a sign with our last name on it. Since we have a somewhat common last name we asked him if it was us or someone else who shared our last name he was waiting for - as it turned out it was us he was waiting for. Neither husband or I had arranged for someone from the Four Seasons to meet us at the airport - we had directions to the hotel and it looked easy enough to find. This was something the Four Seasons had arranged on their own. Anyway, the guy (don't remember his name), asked for our baggage claim tags and then asked if we were renting a car. We gave him the baggage claim tags and told him that yes, we were renting a car. He explained where we needed to go to get the car and what to do afterwords. While we were getting the car he retrieved our luggage from Baggage Claim and had them waiting at the curb when we pulled up with the rental car. He loaded our luggage in the back of the car and gave us directions to the hotel.    Wow.    When we checked in we were greeted with fresh leis and some kind of mango guava juice which was *really* good.    The hotel parks your car - while we were there we never even saw the parking lot/deck. Concierge takes you to and from your hotel room via golf carts. When you want to go somewhere just call them - they'll pick you up and have your car waiting. Often, before you leave they'll give you some bottled water to take with you.    One thing I really liked about the Four Seasons is that it wasn't a ""high-rise"" building. Instead, there are several 2-storey bungalows with four rooms per floor (eight rooms per building). They have paths going to each private entrance that are beautifully landscaped and inaccessible to cars.    The actual room itself was amazing. We got a room ""on the first floor in the Palm Grove section"". If you're looking for a romantic getaway it's important that you ask for this. The Palm Grove section is on the opposite side of where most kids and families are located - so it's real quiet. The first floor rooms have really cool outdoor showers and of course you can easily walk right out of your room down to the beach. The rooms were beautifully decorated too - this was important to me because I *hate* gaudy hotel rooms. There are two floor to ceiling wood pannels/blinds that opens up to a floor to ceiling sliding glass door that opens up to your own private 'porch'. Since we were on the first floor there weren't any fences or gates around our porch - it was wide open to the rest of the resort. This can be good and bad - good because you can easily hear the ocean waves spashing on the beach - bad because you have to remember to lock the sliding glass door when you're not in your room. The floors are done in a beautiful natural slate. There is a whirlpool tub, a large shower stall, and an outdoor shower with lava rock and jungle plants surrounding you. Oh - and for the package we had we received two bathrobes with our initials embroidered on them and a Hawaiian music CD. And when we arrived to our room there was fresh exotic fruit waiting for us.    Food was excellent! We had the 'bed and breakfast' package and ordered in 2 of the 3 mornings we were their. On our last morning we went to their restaraunt and had their buffet - it was out of this world!!! The selection on their buffet was unbelievable!    OK - the hotel was really great and we had absolutely *no* complaints. (I acually wanted to live there and it was very difficult to leave) The only bad thing about it is the price. I wanted to stay somewhere really nice so I didn't mind the price - but I could only afford to be there 3 nights - after the third night we had to down-grade to the Hilo Hawaiian hotel and boy was that a hard thing to do! Luckily breakfast was included in our package (actually, they only give you $50 for breakfast - but each breakfast costs about $25 PER person).    All in all, if you can afford it, I ***HIGHLY*** recommend staying here!!!",Feb 2005,February 2005,,,"Charlotte, NC"
3106920,50,Just forget about the dough and go!,"My wife, two kids (2 yr. old & 6 mo. old), and nanny just returned from a 5 night stay at this terrifice place. My wife and I are experienced travelers and have been to many of the best properties on the planet.    Let me give you the straight shot here!    This resort has it all together.....most things you read on these reviews are right on target about the food, service, staff, spa, et. al. It's true that the place is astonishingly expensive, so whatever your planning on spending just add 40%.    The resort is also very kid friendly, but the kids don't interfere with the adult atmosphere. My wife and I went out by ourselves 4 out of the 5 nights and found that the parents who did have kids with them were very respectful of the situation.    If you do get tired of spending the big bucks and want to grab a cheap burger or some Chinese food, you can hop up the highway to the Waikaloa King Shops, where you will find production food at normal prices. We didn't do this, but will next time......as a change of pace and scenery is always nice.    Don't expect a lot from the rooms. We paid about $1600 a night for a suite, for the nanny situation, but should have gotten two rooms, as their executive suites aren't really a whole lot larger. They are decorated in the standard Four Seasons decor, where less is more.    We can't say enough about this resort and will definately return. It's a very special place where you need to go at least once. We now know why so many families return year after year.    Break the piggy bank and get some R&R!",Feb 2005,,,,"West Covina, CA"
3102493,10,Public access to beaches,The Four Seasons obviously thinks it is above the law when it prohibits the public from access to the beach during its golf tournaments. At first we were not allowed public access due to high waves. Then we were denied public access a few days later due to the Master Card golf tournament. I had to contact the mayor's office and then the Four Seasons said the guard hadn't been informed to let the public in. The high wave warning was cancelled. They said nothing about the golf tournament keeping people out. Hopefully in the future the Four Seasons will abide by the law.,Jan 2005,,,,"Carson City, Nevada"
2906438,50,Best in Hawaii—But Not the Best Value,"After years of anticipation and several forced cancellations, my wife and I finally stayed at the Four Seasons Hualalai. I was a little worried that the resort would not live up to the hype—particularly in light of the fact we had really enjoyed the first part of our trip at the Mauna Lani. As it turns out, I had nothing to worry about. The facilities are fantastic and the staff is wonderful. In fact, every aspect of this hotel seems well thought out from the fitness facilities to the general store to the restaurants and pools to the complimentary laundry facilities. Highlights for us included morning and sunset walks along the beach paths, breakfast at Pahui’a, snorkeling with and feeding the Eagle Rays in the Kings Pond, relaxing in a chaise under the tree at the beach, and an extremely enjoyable round of golf. The only shortcoming is, as others have mentioned, the extremely beautiful rooms should be more soundproof than they are. This was not a significant issue for us but it could be since the resort runs close to capacity most of the time.    We could not have been happier with our stay. In fact, we did something we have never done at a resort in Hawaii—we parked our car and never left. However, this may not be the best resort for those who are value conscious. The Four Seasons cost us more than double per night what we had paid at Mauna Lani earlier in the week (which was a very good deal) and it certainly was not twice as nice. Nor was it worth hundreds of dollars a night more than some other wonderful places we have stayed like the Orchid, the Hyatt Kauai, or the Kea Lani or Ritz on Maui. Good deals are rare because the Four Seasons is extremely popular and they don’t need to offer them. Once you check in, the prices for food etc. compare to other high-end resorts and the quality is generally better. I suspect many or most of the people who stay here would not care about this kind of value analysis but we do (I'm pretty sure our disposable income is lower than most guests). We are extremely glad we decided to stay here and will undoubtedly return, but we could not justify it every time we go to Hawaii.",Dec 2004,,,,Salt Lake City/Utah
2905132,50,beyond compare,"My wife and I went to 3 hotels on our honeymon and found this Four Seasons beyond compare. Most nice resorts have some poolside service, but here they cleaned your sunglasses, gave you cucumbers for your eyes,, ice pops, cold towels, water and fruit kabobs. Dinner at Pahuai was amazing too and it was the best breakfast brunch out of the 3 hotels we visited. We have absolutely no compalaints and only praise for this hotel. This is what a honeymoon destination should be.",Dec 2004,,,,NYC
2876183,50,Fantastic,"My wife and I spent four nights on our honeymoon at the Four Seasons Hualalai and we wish we stayed for more. We loved every aspect of the Four Seasons, but for us the most important part was the relaxed, but refined feel. Our room was a first floor room and we loved being able to shower outdoors, but in retrospect the view from an upstairs room may have been a better choice. We never experienced problems with noise from neighboring rooms, but we did have an end room. In fact the only night sounds we heard were the crashing waves on the beach (we kept our patio doors open every night). The service was attentive, but not cloying. It did not feel like the staff was trying to impress us, but they were just happy to serve us. Our favorite restaurant was Pahuia and it was exceptional. The food was outstanding, the wine list was great and the setting was beautiful. We played 18 holes one day and loved the cookies at the halfway point. We did not bring our clubs, but found the rentals (which were free because two of the holes had alternate greens) to be top notch. We moved on to Maui after our stay here and wished we had remained at the Four Seasons Hualalai. Next time we will.",Dec 2004,October 2005,,,"Boston, MA"
2864659,40,Things are slipping a little bit here in paradise...,"This was our second trip here, and we went for 7 nights instead of 5 last time. We had the exact same room this time as 3 years ago (the bellman said they try to do that if possible...). We arrived at 3:30 and our room was not ready, so they whisked us down to the Beach Tree Bar and we ordered two mai-tai's. Kinda thought they'd be comp'd, but no, $25 later, we're off to our room. Here were some of the little things that were just slightly off. We did not have turn-down service the first night, and then no maid service until we called at 3:15 on the next day. Housekeeping said that the maid service is from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. So, we missed housekeeping that day; they just did a turn-down that night. Next day again no service at 3:00 p.m., so I called the G.M. to complain. We had no towels, one of the small bars of soap left, and were not feeling we were at a Four Seasons. So, what we had to do was set a maid service time for 10:00 a.m. and a turn-down time for 6:00 p.m. That worked fine for the final 4 days. Another thing was that on the first morning, I saw that we didn't get a N.Y. Times fax, which we've really gotten used to as a short form of news daily while drinking our morning coffee. So I phoned the bell desk, asked for that daily, along with a USA Today every morning. Nothing showed up the next day. Back to the G.M., and he said he'd fix it. Next morning, everything's fine, and then the NEXT day nothing again. Call the G.M. again, and it finally gets worked out. Remember, this is at $675/night plus 11.25% tax. The next thing is that we did not like the new Alan Wong Hualalai Grill at all. My wife ordered the rib-eye and it was so tough it was inedible--all gristle. My appetizer was so far-removed from the description that I was shocked when it showed up. It was replaced. All the food is very stylized and precious. It seems that this resort has two ""signature"" restaurants vying for top banana, when what we and the residents always loved was the very normal Club Grill that was there before. We heard that a lot of the residents won't eat there anymore, and now go over to the Residents Beach Club, which was much more to our liking. Make sure you go and say hi to Karlee, Brittany and Melo...they're awesome! The next weird thing was that Wes, the pro at the golf shop, asked me if I'd be interested in rounding out a group on the new, private Weiskopf/Hualalai course. I said, sure, so the next day, at the appointed time, I show up at the bell desk for a short ride to the course. My clubs and shoes were not there, as they'd been promised, so we had to wait while they were brought up from storage. Off to the course...much more difficult, as expected, than the Nicklaus course. We never sign for anything, get treated royally, have a caddy with us, and we have fun. We were wondering what the deal was; were we being comped, or was it going to be $300, or what? Well, upon checkout, I see that it's $250 for the round added to my bill, as well as the $50 we each tipped the caddy. Nicklaus rate is $175. Finally, we had to check out, and I'd asked the day before for a 10:00 a.m. ride to the airport. I check out, and the guy at the bell desk says, ""oh, we made a taxi appointment for 10:30, as requested"". Sorry guys, not true; not with an 11:25 flight. I guess overall I'd have to say that our expectations were not exceeded. It is a wonderful property, and we'll probably be back again, but it's just gotten very pricey, while the service has slipped a tad. Do not miss the Seafood Buffet on Saturday night!!! It is possible to explode from too many grilled lobster tails (6, thank you very much)!",Dec 2004,December 2004,,,"Martinez, California"
2814256,50,Perfection!!,"Stayed here 10/29 to 11/01 and absolutely loved it. We are a couple in our mid thirties, not married and we weren't celebrating anything. We stayed in the Palm Grove section on the first floor with the outdoor lava shower (Room 2801). I had requested that section along with a first floor room. Room was large and the bathroom incredible. I thought the little touches they had in the room were something you don't find elsewhere. Book lights on each nightstand, flashlight, static guard closet and an umbrella in the closet were thoughtful. The flashlight came in especially handy at night while we were walking the beach looking for the sea turtles, which we saw every night. The food was incredible at both restaurants, the highlight being the beach barbeque on Saturday night. We went to Maui for six nights after our stay at the Four Seasons and we didn't have one good meal compared to what we ate while we were at Hualalai. We had the bed and breakfast package which was a great value. The breakfast buffet was very well done. Service overall was impeccable, from check in to check out. The pool service was exceptionally attentive and yet not obtrusive at all. The only small complaint I have would be the soundproofing of the rooms. I agree with another post that said for almost $700 per night, you should not be hearing your neighbors. I did not see that many children, but we avoided the sea shell pool and that area in general. We did see a few during meal times, but they were generally well behaved. This is an expensive hotel but I felt it was worth the money and would definitely stay there again. We only left the hotel once and even then, we quickly returned to the confines of this beautiful hotel!! If you go, make sure to get the outdoor lava shower, it made our stay that much more special. We never used the indoor shower or tub once.",Nov 2004,,,,"Patchogue, NY"
2809453,50,excellent all around,"we stayed there very recently and this is a top-notch resort. here are the highlights:    - gorgeous grounds and vast. you can easily avoid people if desired. beautiful, lush plants and grounds.    - rooms. very clean and spacious bathroom. we had the lava rocks outdoor shower which was simply the highlight of the room. our lanai (room 3001) was never used since it faced a pond which reeked without a breeze. so i'd strike some points for that. but many rooms do face the several ponds on the property. some are nicer than others.    - pools. the main, rectangular infinity pool was the best one. the next biggest pool was for the kids which my wife and i avoided. certainly the nicest kiddie pool i have ever seen. the other ""adult"" pool was simply perfunctory and not once used by anyone. too small to be considered a pool.    - service. impeccable for the most part. we were greeted by our last names everytime. most impressive was when we pulled in from dinner off the grounds one night and the valet greeted us by our name. the staff goes above and beyond the call of duty to greet you. pool service was impeccable and always available, yet not obtrusive. the usual stuff such as cold, mint towels, cucumbers for eyes, evian spritz, fruit skewers, iced water every 15 min, sunglass cleaning, iced popsicles, 35 sunlotion (sun's very hot), and books and recent magazines.    -golf. very good golf course despite 3 temporary holes (they allowed me not only to play 3 extra holes, but play more holes if i felt so without additional charge). clean clubs at driving range and after your round. titleist golf balls for the range. this is a country club atmosphere.    -gym/spa. nicest gym i have ever been to at a resort. exceptionally clean and excellent ""plasma-like"" tvs on all cardio machines with headphones provided.    -food. alan wong was awesome. went twice. highly recommend it. also had lunch at the resident's house which is a tad less expensive than beach tree but just as good and bigger portions. also literally right on the ocean. pahuia for buffet breakfast was best deal there (if you do the bed and breakfast which makes the breakfast buffet only $10 as opposed to $31 per person). anyone's crazy not to do this.    -laundry. this was such a smart move on their part. there are many laundry rooms near all the bungalows which provide all the necessary detergent for free. laundry was free and so easy and convenient to do. an excellent, complementary service. what other hotel has this? i can't think of any.    -people. you will find high class guests. everyone's quiet and respectful although you get many young honeymooners from NYC. on our trip, there were 5 of them, some of whom were a bit loud. but that's what you expect from young (25-30ish).    pure relaxation and bliss. luxury at its finest. my only complaint was the maid missing one night of room turnover. other than that, worth every penny i spent.    also, kona airport is 10-15 min away (you can see the planes come and go from the resort and can't hear them). such an easy commute.    we ate at huggo's in kailua which is highly recommended.    you won't regret it.",Nov 2004,,,,NJ

2804714,50,Top shelf !!!!,"Stayed 10/23/04 thru 10/30/04. Service was beyond our wildest expectations. From the moment we arrived we were greated by name with big smiles then given a tour of the resort on a golf cart on our way to our room.    This resort is not configured like your typical mega resort. The two story bungalows are arranged so that each unit has some ocean view. The atmosphere forces you to relax. The staff is cheerfully willing to answer all requests.    The pool service (fresh towels, ice water, sunscreen, fruit, minty cold towels, reading material) was not only complimentary but they even cleaned our sunglasses. All the restaurants were exceptional and had a respectable wine list. The beach barbeque was the eating highlight of the week.    The spa is first rate not one of your typical cheesey hotel work our rooms but the full meal deal. (Free weights, aerobics, life cycles, lap pool, seam, sauna, jacuzzi) After you work out and sauna they provide you with a robe and sandles to wear back to your room. (Or you can get ready for the day right there with complimentary amenities and private locker.)    The car we rented was a complete waist of money. We could not wait to get back the couple of times we ventured off the resort.    This is a place to relax or enjoy interesting activities on the menu when you want. Never felt crowded or rushed.    Expect to shell out some bucks for the room and eats but if pampering is your desire, this is your nirvana.",Nov 2004,,,,"Seattle, WA"
2799577,40,Almost Great but a few issues to consider,"This is an unusual hotel property. It is set among lava rocks on the rocky Kahala coast. The 30+ 2 story villa style buildings house all the rooms. The property is vast and strikingly beautiful.    Upon arrival we were promptly received, given a cool towel and welcome drink before being taken to our room by golf cart. The trip included a mini tour. Our ground floor room was very large and included an outdoor shower which was awesome!    The things I/we did not like:    1. The soundproofing of the rooms. We left our first room as we could hear screams from the 2 5 year olds next door. In our second room we could hear noises from all adjacent rooms. For $600+/night this is ridiculous.    2. The swimming and pools overall. The hotel boasts of 5 pools but 1 is too small to call a pool. The other is a lap pool hidden off at the spa for serious swimmers only and empty everytime we passed it. The adult pool in the center is a modest sized rectangle, small for the crowd in my view. The best pool is the seashell pool which is also for kids. This pool is large and has a nice form. The downside is the water is 3.5 feet deep throughout and filled with kids. The ocean is not swimmable but the hotel made a lagoon area for its guests. While rocky I enjoyed it. You can also snorkel in this lagoon and you will see seaturtles and many fish.    3. Pahui'a restaurant. The management needs an overhaul here. I celebrated my birthday and they baked the cake. Notwithstanding my bday, and the fact we ordered 2 expensives wines to enjoy, we were rushed out of the restaurant in 65 minutes. That was in addition to service gaffes and mistakes. When I raised some complaints with the manager he was incompetent beyond words and rude. The food was quite good though. I did raise my concerns/experience with the Food and Beverage Manager who made an appropriate remedy the next day and was concerned about it. I hope they fix the staffing and management problems. The F & B manager just arrived at the hotel.    4. Housekeeping failed to do turn down service twice. Again at $600/night    Some things we really enjoyed!    1. Alan Wong's Hualalai Grille is awesome. We ate there 3 of 5 nights. One of the best places I have ever dined. The Breakfast buffet at the Pahui'a, in contrast to the dinner services.    2. The snorkeling in the ocean lagoon and on property fish aquarium lagoon.    3. Drinks at sunset at the Residents Beach House.    4. The outdoor shower. 2nd floor rooms do not have one.    All in all I may go back but I preferred the Maui Four Seasons. The soundproofing really upset me.",Oct 2004,,,,Florida

2754650,30,Why spend such ridiculous sums folks??,"Here it is very simply:  do you want to be a perfumed, pampered kahuna of the underclass working folk here on the Big Isle or do you want to see this wonderful spot for what it really is and can be??  I have been coming here for 20 years and have here now for a month. Try to spend at least a moonth here every year.  This place, to me, reeks of overindulgence, glamour and chi chi- something or another.  Look for $500 a night (or more!!!!!!) you can get the best oceanfront condo in town with kitchen and lanai and toss your table scraps to the crabs.  The people I see up there are of the golf course, professional something ""want to be set"" I am reminded of the socio economic group to whom I belong but, obviously do not subscribe, when I see their fancy everythings!!  - if that's you- go man and aloha to you.  You will NEVER get to know this island from the ""confines"" of this Versailles by the Bay and the people you meet will always be subservient out of necessity(maybe you like that?) as they need their job.  For what it's worth - this ain't sour grapes- if I wanted to I could stay there- it just that it is a joke amongst those in the know- I walked the entire length of the oceanfront for FREE. Right past $10,000,000 homes that are gorgeos to the folks that stay in them 2 weeks a year.  Heh- If you want pool side cabanas with lomi lomi massage on the ocean- and $12 drinks delivered beachside go. I mean it is beautiful. I'll watch you as I walk by and use your beach and pathways as they're all public access.    If you want to experience an Island that even after the construction of a Hard Rock cafe and a BubbaGumps is still beautiful- look around and stay in the real Hawaii- it's still here.

2581573,40,Almost the best Four Seasons - a bit disappointed at the SPA,"This is definitely one of the best Four Seasons I've ever stayed (THE absolute best being the Four Seasons in Paris!). The service was great, the ambience was superb and the ocean view room was gorgeous. However, I was very disappointed at the SPA. Everytime I read a review, it always raved about how the SPA has been voted the #1 SPA in the US and Canada. Needless to say, I spent $ to get some treatments. I have to say, it was very standard, nothing special AT ALL for the price. I do not understand where that #1 came from and certainly felt that the money wasn't well spent. Other than that, all was good. I highly recommend it!",Sep 2004,,,,"New York City, New York"
2577085,50,"An Amazing, Beautiful, Romantic place","Wow.... just got back from my honeymoon at the Four Seasons on the Big Island, and the place is amazing. Contrary to prior reviews, the hotel does have a swimmable beach. I was worried about this and was pleasantly surprised- there is actually a protected cove-like beach, so you cannot get pulled out into the ocean like other beaches in Hawaii. There are also giant Sea Turtles all along the beach, which was really neat to see.    The big island of Hawaii is definitely less developed than other islands, and anyone going there should definitely try to get out and see the other parts of the Island. (we loved hiking down to Wa'Ipio Valley and sea kayaking to Captain cooks monument- with dolphins swimming up to us) When you fly into Kona and drive to the Four Seasons (only a 10 minute drive) you will be surprised that you are surrounded by black lava. It looks kind of desolate but this is only one area of the island, and the property of the Four Seasons is totally amazing and lush, with 5 pools, a saltwater swimming area full of fish and an eagle ray, and a beautiful golf course.    Also the tennis courts, gym, and spa are AMAZING. We have stayed in many 5 star hotels, and this place blows them all away as far as these things go. If you play tennis they bring you towels and a pitcher of gatorade and another one of water, all set up in a shaded area where you can sit to cool off between sets.    The spa and gym are the best we have seen at any resort. The gym has tons of machines, with everything you could want. There is even an amazing lap pool. The spa has seperate outdoor treatment huts for massages. We got a couples aromatherapy which was amazing.    We did the ""Bed and Breakfast"" deal... they have an amazing breakfast buffet which was also the best we have ever seen. A buffet fit for a king. One small complaint: I'm not sure how the Bed and Breakfast deal saves you money, because I think it was $100 additional per day, but if you just paid for the breakfast buffet each day it would be $50 total (for two people).    People have complained about kids at the Four Seasons- there were very few that we saw, but it was also the first week of September, when most kids are in school. Even if kids are there, one of the best things about the resort is that there are TWO adults-only pools, both of which are beautiful. We actually found ourselves alone TWICE in the Palm Grove pool... no one else was even there!    Definitely do the Sunset Cruise if you go- it was incredibly beautiful, on a 60 foot catamaran. (if you get seasick easily you may want to pass on this)    The restaurants were great, though we felt the nicest one, Pahuia, is over-rated. The new one by the golf course is great.    Overall, this is a great place to go for a honeymoon. Very romantic, amazing staff, great stuff to do during the day. (no real nightlife at all, and things close early) Much more low-key than the Four Seasons in Maui- which is more like a huge hotel and always seemed much more crowded at the pool.",Sep 2004,September 2004,,,
2514122,50,Unsurpassed quality!,"As a first time visitor to Hawaii, I spent a great deal of time researching where to stay. I wanted my family's (wife and 4 children) first experience to the islands to be special. I chose the Four Seasons based on Tripadvisor reviews, Conde Nast Traveler reviews and past experience with the Four Seasons level of service. Our stay at the Four Seasons was better than we could have imagined. I honestly cannot think of one complaint . The grounds are immaculate, the staff is so helpful and acccomadating they almost seem like their on vacation with you. The kids had a great time in the pools and contrary to earlier reviews, there IS a swimmable beach with two sea turtles in the proteced area! We stayed at the end of August and the hotel was near capacity , but definitely did not feel crowded. We stayed in a two bedroom suite in the Palm Grove section which was quiet and peaceful. The hotel gave ukelele lessons, bead making and lai making lessons, all of which the family took advantage of. The spa facilities were top rate and the classes were also run by knowledgable professionals. Unfortunately, it is an expensive place to stay, but if you can save for that truly SPECIAL vacation, this is definitly IT! My wife and I are planning to go back for our 20th anniversary in two years. We're both counting down the days! The Four Seasons is to be congratulated for creating a truly memorable experience for my me and my family!",Sep 2004,,,,"Thousand Oaks, CA"
2431948,50,Heavenly,"This is the most amazing hotel I have ever been to. My husband and I went here for our honeymoon. It was perfect. Although the hotel was sold out, it felt empty - we had no trouble getting seats at any one of the 4 pools. The staff was so helpful, nice, and courteous. They even remembered our names at breakfast. We loved it so much we checked out of our other hotel (which was a disappointment - the Mauna Lani) and came back to the Four Seasons to end our honeymoon. I can't say enough good things about this place. It is expensive - but amazing.",Aug 2004,July 2004,,,"Arlington, Virginia"
2301324,30,FACTUAL review with some flaws... good but not great,"I stayed at the Four Seasons Hualalai for the last 4 days of my honeymoon. Short version of the review is this: the hotel has a TON of kids, and even though we paid for an ocean view room and told them we were on our honeymoon, they put us in the SeaShell rooms which are where all the kids are at.    1) First floor rooms are great but hotel needs soundproofing - the folks upstairs were VERY noisy.    2) We called the ""watersports"" place the first night to request a reservation on a sunset cruise the last night (this is part of the resort) and 3 days later never received a return phone call.    3) We went to the concierge to request information about a day trip and the woman said ""We'll bring it to your room right away"". When I said I could wait for the info she insisted ""no problem"" and it would come to my room shortly. 2 hours later (we happened to be hanging in our gorgeous room for fun) the information had not arrived, and when I called the concierge they said ""We tried to deliver but no one was there"" which wasn't true - we were in our room the whole time, no loud tv, no reason we would have not heard them come.    4) Paid $175 to have dinner for two on the beach, and also requested rose petals and candles in room after the dinner (part of a package they offer). When we got back to our room not only had housekeeping not come (the concierge who arranged the dinner had asked us what time we wanted the room made up), but the flowers and candles were not set up either.    We did receive a $200 credit for our troubles, but for over $500 a night we expected better service. Four Seasons Maui (we stayed right before the Hualalai) was much better, staff was more attentive.",Jul 2004,July 2004,,,"The Big Apple, New York"
2290158,50,The best hotel on the Big Island by far!!!!!,"UNBELIEVEABLE!!! AWESOME. Food GREAT Room was incredible (rm 710) They drive you around on golf carts. Not a brown leaf on any plant on the whole property. Gorgeous! Once yo stay at the Four Seasons, you will never stay anywhere else.",Jul 2004,,,,"Chicago, IL"
2230276,50,"Mahalo, Mahalo, Mahalo!!","SHORT VERSION: You won't be disappointed and will likely be dazzled with service, amenities, romance, and an amazing setting. This resort has room for families and Honeymooners (us) and anyone who tells you otherwise just didn't do their homework and get the right room! We can't wait to go back!    LONG VERSION:    At $650+ a night for an ocean view room, our expectations were very high to say the least...that being said they were exceeded in all areas. We spent 5 nights of our honeymoon there and spent time at the Mauna Kea and Mauna Lani also and the Four Seasons is well worth the extra money. The service was exceptional from the moment we arrived (the juice provided at check in is very tasty-and they offer to custom fill your fridge if you like (prices are reasonable). Our room was not ready so they directed to us to the Beach Tree Restaurant for some lunch where Mary, the manager of the Beach Tree, greeted us by name upon our arrival (amazing) and upon completion of our excellent meal informed us our room was ready and had the bell staff pick us up there with our bags. She also informed us of the Sea and Stars Buffet (Wednesdays) and went out of her way to get us a beach front private table for the sunset seating that night (even though that seating was sold out). Throughout our stay Mary continually went above and beyond to give us great tables and say hello when we walked by. Our pre-arrival room request for the quieter ""palm grove"" section and an outdoor shower room was granted without problem. The room was spacious and elegant but still Hawaiian, the bed was very comfortable (we are picky on this), and the bathroom was great with lavish amenities, complimentary slippers and robes. There was also a complimentary bottle of champagne (don't know if this is just for honeymooners-with a sign on it offering to exchange it for a chilled bottle at our leisure by calling room service-very nice touch). We loved the outdoor shower and did not use the indoor one once. There was no bug problem in the shower and the water pressure is awesome. Wireless internet access was nice for checking email (small charge). If you are traveling without kids, definitely stay in the Palm Grove section as it is very quiet. The pools were the best on the island (though Maui Prince is very nice also), with 2 adult pools (one in Palm Grove does not offer food service but is very quiet), one kid/adult pool (Seashell) and King's Pond. Feeding the Manta Rays in King's Pond was fun and the snorkeling is okay. Service at the pools was phenomenal with cold towels, otter pops, Evian Spritzer (sometimes you had to ask them for this), and fresh fruit. Try the Lava Flow drink! Pahuia was excellent, though pricey (the chocolate soufflé was to die for) and we made an effort to have a drink at sunset at the Lava Lounge outside the restaurant each night. The Wednesday buffet was fantastic with all you can eat fresh lobster, shrimp, and a million other items and this proved to be one of our more economical meals on the island. The spa is as advertised (best in the world) and offers the best workout facility I've seen at a resort. The outdoor treatment rooms are nice, though not nearly as private as the Mauna Lani (best massage and treatment rooms on the island-but don't stay there). At night they light torches throughout the property and you feel as though you are in your own private Hawaiian village. Though the hotel was sold out, you could always find a quiet place and the sunsets, bars, restaurants, rooms, and staff makes this a very romantic and amazing place. The only negative is there is not a swimmable beach but as long as you know this going in you won't be disappointed (just stay at Mauna Kea or the Maui Prince for 2-3 nights) to enjoy the beaches. I could go on for hours... I can't imagine being disappointed at this place and can't wait to go back. If you can afford it, you won't regret the extra money and if you can't, stay there anyway (golf view room maybe?) as you still won't regret it. It's hard to leave the resort once you are there but if you do, take a day and rent a Kayak at Kona Boys and paddle across the Bay to the Captain Cook Monument for some amazing snorkeling. We saw spinner dolphins on our way across the bay (very cool!). Then go down to Place of Refuge for some more snorkeling (even better) and check out the numerous giant turtles. Any questions... I love talking about this place so just let me know. Mahalo and please give Mary at the Beach Tree our warmest Aloha!  -The Johnstons",Jun 2004,,,,"Portland, OR"
2220834,50,Almost perfect...,"We went to the Four Seasons with very high expectations based on several people who have visited the property before. We were not disappointed. Our kids had the best time at the Sea Shell pool area. We were lucky, there were very few kids the week we were there, as we heard it can get busy. They felt like they owned the pool. There was so much to do on the property - we were never bored. The Spa and Fitness Center were unbelievable. Everyone greeted us with a smile and knew our names within a couple of days. We loved having the laundry facilities so conveniently close by, no need to overpack as we ended up wearing clean clothes over and over. We had the best week ever. Of all the Four Seasons properties we have vacationed at I would have to say this was the most complete resort there is. This property has the feel of what Hawaii should be. The bungalow style resort is much preferred to the high rise type hotels on Maui. It is much quieter, you don't have loud doors closing at all hours of the night. I think we all slept better than at any other resort we have stayed at. This one is a keeper and we can't wait to go back!",Jun 2004,,,,"Newport Beach, CA"
2205554,50,Gorgeous & What Hawaii is all about! Shouldn't miss this!,"We were on the Big Island for 10 days (April 30 - May 11, 2004) staying at one of the other luxury resort condos a couple of miles north...and always love to tour other resort restaurants and grounds, etc... The Four Seasons is an exclusive one of a kind luxury setting...And we ate at the Beach Tree Grill 3 times - yes RIGHT ON THE BEACH. We loved it so much! It is excellent casual gourmet! Perfect setting and features nice low-key live music trios playing soft dinner tunes as the sunset takes your breath away. BRING YOUR CAMERA AT SUNSET! If we were honeymooners or celebrating our anniversary, we would definitely stay here.",Jun 2004,,,,"Austin, TX"
2183891,50,The PERFECT Resort! Service is AWESOME for Hawaii!,"I just don't see how people could NOT LOVE this place. It is BY FAR the most fabulous resort that Hawaii (known for having cheesy resorts) has ever seen. The grounds are gorgeous, the restaurants are aethetically pleasing and also serve incredible food, the service is outstanding! THERE IS A GORGEOUS BEACH with chairs and service. In fact, there is a long strip of white sand beach and there are specific parts you CAN swim in, however, why bother when you have 4 GORGEOUS pools to swim in and pool side service that will cater to your every need? At the pool they even have this new service in which they will clean and tighten your sunglasses (and still give you cold spearmint smelling ice cold towels and Evian spritzes). The rooms are luxurious, each providing two robes per person. The food is great. I loved the breakfast buffet at the ocean front restaurant ($25 per person). As far as the kid thing goes, believe me I was scared after reading the reviews on this site, however they aren't even the least bit bothersome. (We went early June 2004) There is a pool called the SeaShell pool and that's where the kids hang out, the adults have 2 pools of their own, the big one being the Beach Tree pool. No kids in sight there. In fact, a couple kids came in the pool with their dad and everyone was looking at them wondering what they were doing in the adult territory. There are TONS of honeymooners, I think there were at least 25 just married couples, so you can assume the place is romantic too. Anyway, cell phone use isn't allowed poolside (gotta go to the walkways), and phones must be kept on vibrate, so no annoying agents or stockbrokers gabbing away. However there is WIFI all around the resort, including at the pool, so I used instant message pool side and surfed the net (this is a major plus for me!) The spa is AWESOME, I had the most incredible massage, all the therapists are TOP NOTCH. Gorgeous steam room and sauna, beautiful lockers and showers. The sports center was amazing with only the best machines, yoga, pilates and spinning classes. I could go on and on...... THIS PLACE WAS GREAT!!! However, you should go here if you can afford it because it's not cheap. The most inexpensive room is $700.00 a night. Everything in the place is for sale and so believe me you'll want to buy a bunch of things you don't need. On our way to the airport they even stocked out car with cold bottled water. Now that's what I'm talking about! The only problem we had is that a corporate retreat was having a party till 10pm for it's employees and it was really loud so we complained (we just had massages and dinner and were really tired) and the asst. manager felt so bad that she knocked our room rates off a couple hundred bucks for two nights. Oh yes, we did have one more problem, we wanted to stay another night or two and they were SOLD OUT!!!",Jun 2004,,,,
2180833,50,Great Property,We just returned (6/7/04) from the Four Seasons Hualalai and can honestly say this could be our favorite Four Seasons. The service was terrific everywhere but the front desk. Once you finally get into your room (we had to wait for two hours) your vacation will begin. We can't wait to return.,Jun 2004,,,,"Newport Beach, California"
2150920,50,This resort is fantastic!,"I have stayed at many resorts throughout Hawaii and the world, and I must say that this resort makes the best use of wonderful oceanfront property that I have ever seen. The room was fantastic (we had a one-bedroom suite). Some of the reviews give the impression that there is no beach at this resort. This is not true at all. There is only a small portion of the beach that is swimmable, but there is a long stretch of beach along which to relax and enjoy the beauty of the surroundings. The swimming pools are wonderful, and there are two pools that are child friendly (one of which is a sand-bottom toddler beach). For those wishing to avoid any commotion, there are also two adults only pools (one of which is very small). We went with our 2 year old son, and it was a wonderful experience. The resort is very child friendly (nice children's menu, amenities for children). Some of the reviewers were disappointed that there were so many children when they were there. We did not have that experience because we were there in May. If you want to have a quieter more child-free vacation, take note of when you go -- any resort in Hawaii over the summer or other school vacation frankly will have a lot of children there. Just because a place is expensive doesn't mean people won't bring their families. Also, if you prefer quiet, don't stay in the ""Sea Shell"" section of the resort, because this is closest to the children's swimming area. I agree with some of the other reviewers that the service was not up to snuff for a Four Seasons -- it was very good, but not great. Also, there was not much entertainment there to speak of. The restaurant Pahu'ia is fantastic, however. Food wonderful, view amazing. Definitely go!",Jun 2004,January 2005,,,"San Francisco, California"
2121368,40,Pretty good,"Stayed here May, 2004. The rooms are great. VERY attentive/friendly service. Nice pool(s). A LOT of babies and smalll children here though. A lot of people in general. This is not the place to go if you want peace and quiet. Also, as noted elsewhere, there is no swimable beach. If I return, I will probably stay at the Mauna Kea. It's grounds are GORGEOUS, it's peaceful, quieter, and the beach is AMAZING. I think for a young family with babies, the Four Seasons is your place (very expensive of course however!). Otherwise, you may want to look elsewhere. One helpful hint: If you do prefer quiet, ask to stay in the Palm Grove area. Other areas are super busy and loud, with people everywhere.",May 2004,,,,
2117846,50,Four Seasons Hualalei can't be beat,"If you're looking for heaven on earth, then this just might be it. The Four Seasons Hualalei is in a very secluded beach setting. From the minute you arrive, the friendly and pampering service begins...and with the Four Seasons touch.    After getting out of your car, your are escorted into the lobby to the front desk where you are introduced to the registration person who greets you with a lei, iced cold wash cloth, and cold fruit juice. Our room wasn't ready (we did arrrive early), and were given a hotel cell phone, told where we could have a bite for lunch, and that they would call as soon as the room was ready. Sure enough, as soon as we finished lunch, we got a call, returned to the lobby, were met by a bellman who already had our luggage in a golf cart, and were given a tour of the whole facility before arriving at our room.    The room itself was beautiful and impeccably clean and fresh. Big deep tub in the marble bathroom and separate shower. The room had every kind of thoughtful Four Seasons touch: book lights for late night reading, refrigerator, toaster (which was used by room service which toasted our toast in our room), coffee maker, balcony with comfortable chairs, etc. We did pay extra for a prime ocean view room, however, upon seeing the golf view rooms, would probably do that for the next visit.    Pool service is definitely Four Seasons: iced cold refresher towels, fresh fruit, iced water constantly filled, drink service, etc. The hotel has several pools, and although there are lots of kids, they tend to use one of the pools in particular and there is one adults only pool. Children were not a problem.    The restaurant choices were excellent, although one did require long pants at dinner (no thank you) while the others were ""resort casual"". One of the restaurants (at the golf course) is now under the supervision of Alan Wong and the food was fantastic. Excellent selection at the beach for lunch and dinner. Lunch can also be delivered to you pool side.    The resort has a protected part of the ocean/beach which makes swimming in it a joy and great for snorkeling and swimming with sea turtles. Another separate lagoon is unbelievable for snorkeling and has a huge assortment of spectacular fish.    Each room is exquipped with high-speed wireless internet connections. The concierge will provide a bridge free of charge if you're not wireless and the connection is $9.95 per day.    Because the hotel is part of a residential association, it has the most well equipped and beatiful gym/spa facility that I've ever seen at a hotel, and the use of it is free to guests.    All in all, for the prices paid to stay at a Four Seasons, my expectations were high, and they were exceeded.",May 2004,,,,New York
1731159,50,"beautiful setting, not uo to four seasons standards for service","Stayed here 7/2003. Have stayed at many 4 seasons around the world. The beach, sea turtles, foilage are perfect. Room is above avg for four seasons (very nice). Service is worst of any 4 seasons at which I have stayed. Food is lousy also. Kids everywhere. 4 seasons Maui and Ritz Carlton Kapalua on maui both better service. More to do on Maui.  Hualalai would be very romantic (and is romantic) but there are lots of kids.

1684095,50,Amazing resort,"this is one of the most amazing resorts ive been at. we were there for 7 days. at the hotel we encountered many amazing pools, great rooms, and execellent service, in fact when we called the front desk they knew who we were on the phone. our room was incredible. we had 2 showers and a bathtub. the outdoor lavarock shower was beautiful. when we got there, our names were spelled out in bath sponges on the tub. we experienced an AMAZING luau (if thats how u spell it?) the luau included fire dances, pig roasts, hawaiin cultural festivals, and amazing performances. the grounds were beautiful. the pools were exceptional (people came and toweled our faces down with cool water), the one pool was a man made salt water snorkeling pool. also we went snorkling on a catamaran in the ocean (i highly recommend that). the only complaint was that we ordered a pitcher of orange juice for our room and it cost $40 becuase they charged us for the glass it was in. all of the things we did were included because it was our company trip. so if you go you may not get all of the features we had. i highly recommend this place",Feb 2004,,,,"Easton, Pa"
1648347,50,Frequent Traveler found it Amazing,"My husband and I just returned from 5 days at the Kona Four Seasons and enjoyed every minute of it. As frequent travelers of luxury hotels we found this one of the best in Hawaii by far. We were pleasantly suprised to see very few children and those that were there had their own pool tucked away from all of the adult pools and amenities. The service was attentive, the grounds flawless, the gym fully equipped, the rooms very comfortable and all with amazing ocean views/breezes. If I were to complain about anything it would be that Kona, itself, is not as ""green"" an island as most but one wouldnt know this once on this lush resort. Also, instead of taking 10 minutes for the front desk to bring me a requested item from their coffee house, it took them 12 minutes...not bad! All said, I would highly recommend this resort and am making arrangements to return in a month.",Feb 2004,,,,Los Angeles CA
1648262,50,One of the Best in Hawaii,"Just returned from a five day stay at the Four Seasons Hualalai. I've stayed at other luxury resorts in Hawaii, and Hualalai is one of the best. The resort is spacious with four pools and a white sand beach. One of the pools is ""adults only."" There is also a beautiful pool at the spa that is hardly used. Yes, there are children but the resort is designed in such a way that it is easy to find quiet and solitude (unlike the other mega resorts in Waikoloa and Wailea). The staff, especially front desk and concierge, were always responsive to any of my requests. I felt the ""aloha"" spirit from everyone, and it seemed genuine, not contrived. There is nothing better than the Saturday Beach BBQ, sitting on the beach, eating a great meal and watching the sunset. The rooms are large, all with outside lanais with ocean views and some with a private lava rock outdoor shower. Gripes? It's become an expensive annual vacation!",Feb 2004,,,,"San Francisco, CA"
1646646,20,More Kids than Macy's at Christmas!,"My wife and I wanted a peaceful retirement vacation. My brother had recommended the Hapuna Prince or the Fairmont, but I loved my stays on business at the Four Seasons in Boston and San Francisco so thought I would stay with a winner in Hawaii as well... boy was I wrong. What are parents thinking that they bring their small children to the Four Seasons? There were teenagers around the pools but they were good and kept quiet. The little ones with the screaming and running, but we blame the parents not the children. Have you ever tried to float quietly in a pool with kids on floats bumping into you? The Four Seasons is not a Disneyland Pool Party!! At $560/night I requested a refund and was re-buffed by the Desk Manager who suggested I visit the small island of Kuaui if I wanted a quiet place! How RUDE!! I escalated my complaint to the General Manager the next morning who moved us to a quieter section of the hotel. The last 2 days were peaceful, but we stayed in our rooms as the pools continued to be dominated by children.",Feb 2004,,,,"Chicago, Illinois"
1640594,40,Doesn't live up to the Four Seasons name...,"My husband and I married at the Four Seasons Hualalai in late July 2003. (This post is delayed, but trust me I remember our stay well!!) The hotel is fine but really lacked that something special that you expect from a Four Seasons resort. It is large and sprawling and quite impersonal. We were treated completely anonymously by the staff and given no extras at all -- no note, no champagne or flowers, nothing special at all (and I won't even dare mention an updrade) -- despite the fact that we were spending thousands of dollars on a wedding and reception there. There is no beach, there are tons of kids around, the snorkel pool (Kings Pond) was cold and murkey. Why were were paying over $500 a night for this??!! We honeymooned at the two Four Seasons resorts in Bali and they only highlighted what the Hualalai had lacked -- the staff there were so gracious and welcoming, knew our names from the first moment, and gave us cards and flowers and gifts of fruit.  That is the level of service you are paying for, but the Hualalai seems to have forgotten.",Feb 2004,,,,"New York City, New York"
1611352,50,The people are crazy...,"I have no idea what some of the other reviewers are talking about. I spent the last week of my honeymoon at the resort and I could not have asked for a better experience. The service was superb and the staff was extremely friendly- you can not walk past a staff memeber without a smile and an Aloha from everyone - including the maids. We were lucky enough to be upgraded to an executive suite right on the ocean with our own hot tube and beach access- it was by far the most spectacular room we have ever stayed in. We also arrived to a nice note from the hotel manager, a bottle of champagne, a bottle of red & white wine, fresh fruit and a dessert dish in our room. We dined in all the resturants and the food was good although the tuna was over cooked at Pahu i'a.  Try Wed. night or Fri night buffet at the Beach Tree and definetly drop the cash for the romantic dinner on the beach. One of the funnest nights of my life - and once again, exceptional service. If you are visiting Hawaii, you must close out your trip here.",Jan 2004,,,,"Chicago, IL"
1557531,40,Would return,"I am a first time user of this site and find it helpful. I was suprised by the reviews of this resort, my wife and I spent a week in August on Kona. I must suggest timimg is apparently erevything at this resort. We found it peaceful, few kids, few anyone unlike some of the other postings. Also, a correction you can swim in the ocean which I did. The restarurant has a beatuiful view and food/wine was wonderful although a bite pricecy but what isn't on the island, I assure you I paid far less than $100 for a fine bottle of wine. The only disappointment was the message @ the spa rated about a 5 from 10. Yes, we would return but timing is apparently everthing. Enjoy.",Jan 2004,,,,"Frankiln, TN"
1550573,50,Maybe it's just me but....,"My wife and I visited the Four Seasons for the first week of our honeymoon and I have to say I am a bit baffled by some of the reviews about children everywhere. Yes, we did see some kids, mainly around the big pool area and at one of the beach BBq's, but not in any obtrusive fashion, and never at dinner. It's possible we missed the worst of it because we were there in June. Anyway, we thought the hotel was delightful. Our room looked out over the golf course to the sea. Was immaculate, quiet and well serviced. The staff I found to be very helpful, especially around the pools. Dining was pricey and, in my gastronomic opinon, a bit average for the cash, but well presented.  Wine was astronomical. I can remember paying upwards of $150 for a bottle of wine that costs me no more than £25 at home. The resort was clean, looked superb and checking in was almost the best part of the whole experience. The Outdoor lava shower was great fun!. The Kings pool (the one with the stingrays) was so good, I can't believe there were not more people in it. The beach (or lack thereof) didn't bother me too much, as I liked to just lie around in the shade and let the roving evian spritzer and ice lollie ladies do their jobs. One of the best laughs we had was at the Cultural Centre learning to play the Ukalaylei. Watching sundown at the beach tree bar with the sound of the waves and tiki torches everywhere made it perhaps the most romantic place I have ever been. All in, a great start to married life.",Jan 2004,,,,"Glasgow, Scotland"
1544591,10,Horrible Service,The service at this hotel is horrible. There was only one staff member that extended any assistance for requests and she was hawaiian. The other staff have no concept of aloha or friendly service. You can't swim in the ocean here. Not only is it all lava but I found man-o-war on the beach.,Jan 2004,,,,
1540773,20,Love the Hotel but tons of kids!,"The amount of children at this resort staggers the mind! Kids morning, noon, and night!!! I came here to get some long awaited R&R and what do I find but families at every turn. Kids eating food while in the pools, two babies swimming sans bathing suits (and defecating) in the adult pool with mom, screaming children at night while I try to sleep, whining kids in the restuarants, etc...    What a bad experience, and one which I did not expect as I had a wonderful quiet time at the FS Maui.",Jan 2004,,,,Portland Oregon
1536983,40,Go to Four Seasons Maui instead,"Our stay at the Four Seasons Big Island was very, very disappointing.  The ""quiet pool""/Adult pool was very crowded and everyone had cell phones out and in use. The pool staff tried in vain to curtail the cell phone abuse. It is not relaxing to hear multiple phone conversations going on at the same time. I blame this on the guests, not the staff.  We have never seen so many cell phones at the same time.    The guests at this hotel seem to have an attitude of ""entitlement"" and really did not care about anyone else. This attitude extended to the various restaurants. Those guests with children did nothing to quiet their children or prevent them from running and yelling all around the resturant. This was especially true at the breakfast buffet. The kids would run right in front of us while the parents were on their cell phones. This I do blame on the hotel staff which I believe should have intervened to curtail this situation.    The guest rooms were spacious and well-decorated, but the sound proofing is less than adequate. If people are out on their decks talking, you can forget about your room being quiet. This seems to happen anytime between 5:30 am and 11:00 pm (and later).    We much prefer the Fours Seasons Maui, where you can even save some money, compared to the Big Island.",Jan 2004,,,,"San Clemente, CA"
1398241,30,Beautiful property and rooms...........,"checking in as an obviously childless couple wishing to enjoy a quiet 20 year anniversary celebration, we were thrilled with our beautiful room and comfy bed only to be terribly disappointed that they had stuck us right in the middle of the ""family section"" right in front of the kiddie pool - AAAAAaaarg!!!!!!    There's nothing like being awakened at 3am EVERY morning for 4 days by a screaming baby and dad never failing to let that front door slam as he left the room every morning at 5 or 6am to soothe the continually screaming baby. Waaaay too many families at this resort.    We requested another room only to be told none were available. It truly ruined our ""romantic"" mornings.    Luckily we were able to catch up on lost sleep lazing in the great private cabanas on the sand with evian spritzes and cool drinks. We would stay here again, but if you are looking for peace and quiet be sure to request a room in another area.",Oct 2003,,,,"San Francisco, CA"
1396067,20,Where's the Aloha?,"As a travel fan who grew up on the Big Island - and who loves the 4S Wailea - I couldn't wait to check out the Four Seasons and see what everyone was raving about. While I think many - no most - people will love this resort, I found it a very disappointing experience.The biggest physical problem for me is the beach, or lack thereof. The last big resort to hit the Gold Coast, the 4S is stuck on a rocky peninsula that gets pounded by an endless series of waves, making it a very uninviting place to swim. The resort has tried to compensate with numerous pools. But my feeling is if you want a pool, there are many just as nice in Los Angeles that don't require a flight. But my bigger disappointment was how everything is focused not on giving you the best experience, but on attaining that additional marginal dollar. For example, there actually are some pretty good diving spots near the resort where you can actually get in the real ocean. The resort won't tell you about them, however, because they're hoping to sell you on expensive (and short) sailing trips to get to them. There are wonderful local restaurants nearby, where you can really see what actual Hawaii life is like, but all the staff wanted to do was sell us on the resort spots (one of which is good but very expensive). Those restaurants are so far away, why should we bother? It's a like a casino - they don't want you to leave. Which brings me to the staff, who have had all the Hawaiian-ness drilled out of them. The spa employees, however, are lovely, as was the staff at the golf course.Good things: big rooms, nice pools, one great restaurant and a really wonderful spa. But this is resort could be in Phoenix or anywhere else. It is not Hawaii.",Oct 2003,,,,San Francisco

Beautifully laid out, fantastic landscaping, wonderful (if pricey) restaurants. The rooms are very nice, and try to get a ground floor room so you can take an outdoor shower! The service was top-notch. So, I have no suggestions for improvement except....they need to find a way to accomodate families with children AND people who are there to get away from children. At times it felt like we staying at a kid's summer camp. We ate at the most expensive restaurant on the property, and there were small kids running around unattended, right among the tables. It's the parent's responsibility to watch their kids, but the hotel must also find a way to make sure other guests aren't disturbed. Perhaps some sections of the restaurant reserved for families? Or even times when kids under 10 aren't allowed at the resort? I understand neighboring Kona Village does that sometimes. I'm not trying to be anti-kid, but this ain't Disneyland or McDonalds. When I'm paying these prices for a room or a meal, I don't want to hear kids yelling and crying. I love this hotel, but this problem will give me serious pause next time I think about a trip to the Big Island.",May 2003,,,,San Jose CA
857806,30,This Four Seasons was a Disappointment,"We found the Four Seasons Resort on the Big Island to be just as the ""Hideaway Report"" had warned: it felt like a sprawling apartment complex with no sense of center. Rooms were fair, but not nearly as plush as on Maui. Ground floor rooms were noisy when the upstairs guests dragged heavy teak furniture around their deck every night. Outdoor showers sounded cool in the brochure but in fact were dark (we never used ours). Worse, they were the source of a parade of insects that crawled under the shower door and into the bathroom each night. One particularly creepy critter looked and acted like a cockroach: it would crawl on the bathroom mirror and dart around the countertop when we turned on the lights at night. The hotel offered a consolation prize (bath salts) but this visitor was left unimpressed. The health spa is very nice, but not enough to compensate for lousy rooms and the lack of a beach.",Feb 2003,,,,"Omaha, Nebraska"
857168,50,Truly Beautiful Resort,"This is a gorgeous place with incredible, friendly service. The rooms are simply beautiful and those located on the lower floor have outdoor showers surrounded by lava rock - loved this! The food is excellent, although quite expensive. The resort has created a somewhat protected ""pool"" in the ocean that will allow for swimming during calm seas but its very rocky and reef shoes would be advised. This is the only place at the resort where swimming in the ocean would be possible. There are wonderful tidepools to explore along this part of the beach though and many different kinds of shells to inspect. Overall, the resort has a country-club feel and in fact many patrons visit only to play golf and use the spa and fitness facilities. When I return to The Big Island this is definitely the hotel I'll book.",Feb 2003,,,,
848100,50,Amazing...,"The only complaint about this property is the lack of a truly swimmable beach.... but other than that, this 4 Seasons is truly remarkable. The layout of the hotel is such that you enjoy great privacy and escape the more ""hotel"" feel. The service is top notch, and the spa is bliss. You will definitely pay the price to enjoy the property... significantly more expensive than the Maui property... but worth it.",Jan 2003,,,,"Los Angeles, CA"
753596,50,Utopia (without the ocean swim),"We stayed there for three days/nights as part of our honeymoon, having spent the first three days/ nights on the Big Island at the Prince Hapuna Beach. Everything that is said about the Four Seasons is true -- the serenity, pampering, kindness, and attention to detail is without parallel, anywhere.    The only downside to the resort is that the beautiful Hawaiian ocean is, for all intents and purposes, unavailable to its guests -- at least to those who want to enjoy the amenities for which the hotel is so well known. One might consider doing as we did -- spending a few nights at the Hapuna Beach Hotel (around 40% the price of the Four Seasons, reserving on the Hapuna Beach ""Hot Deals"" website), and afterwards (definitely afterwards!!) going to the Four Seasons. (The Hapuna Beach/ Mauna Kea beaches are, deservedly, ranked among the best in the world.)    If it's enough for you to lie on the sand (though even the sand is finer at the Hapuna Beach/ Mauna Kea part of the island) or by a gorgeous pool, and money isn't a factor in your vacation plans, then by all means, go to the Four Seasons and enjoy the utopia offered there!",Nov 2002,,,,California
683656,50,Heaven on Earth,"Pampering at its finest!! Adult pools that emphasize quiet and relaxation. We consider our stay at the Four Seasons, Hualalai a complete holiday with 5 star service in a 5 star resort.  The infinity edge pool is designed to eliminate waves when one swims which minimizes disruption to other patrons. The water temperature in the pools is the most perfect I've ever been in. You can float for hours undisturbed.    The acommodations in most units include an outdoor lava shower. We stayed at the resort for five days and never used the bathtub or the indoor shower.    The restaurants are fantastic. One restaurant features 4 or 5 separate tables that floats on the sand at the beach.    The beach tree grill features outdoor dining and provides live contemporary hawaiian music at night (something we looked forward to).    We visited the resort in August and planned on returning during the December. The resort is sold out for the next three years with a wait list of 200 people during the holiday season.    The price we paid to stay at the Four Seasons is worth every penny!!!    My wife and I still talk about our vacation months after returning home.    S N F P",Aug 2002,,,,
