The room was nicely laid out with modern Hawaiian decor and upgrade amenities.  The property sits beautifully on the ocean with several ponds.  Snorkelers would love this property.  They also had a water activity shack that offered several activities and we did a sunrise canoe paddle, which is recommended for anyone that wants to feel the spirit of the island as well as canoe surfing for those with a more adventurous soul. They have restaurants and bars that are nicely set with beautifully views.  The Canoe House is one of the best restaurants I have dined at and that is saying a lot considering I specialize in culinary wine tours.

It's wonderful for adults and kids alike. It's beautiful, impeccably clean and well designed, amazing service and great food all around. It's the kind of resort that feels right to us. We don't generally like the feeling of resorts that are too removed from from the place or environment they're in, like they're closed off. The Mauna Lani really feels like Hawaii, it incorporates the natural beauty of its location on the grounds. 
I can't recommend the Mauna Lani enough. It's a world class resort. I wish I didn't live so far away from it.","Date of stay: August 2022","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The whole time we were there for the entire week, we were met with corporate guests coming and going. They were loud and rowdy, creating the atmosphere as if you're vacationing in Vegas. Drinking at the pool and setting up boombox, ""blasting"" country music at the beach. Those corporate guests really acted as if they were the only people on the beach, some of them even ""saving"" beach chairs for their friends before they arrive. It was very disappointing for a nice leisurely resort to turn into a corporate hotel. I've been here two times this year and both times were full of corporate events and guests tramping the hotel ground. You think great they are leaving today and a bus load of them will come tomorrow... very disheartening. Plus this hotel ain't cheap either. If I wanted a Vegas atmosphere I only needed to pay a fraction of what this hotel costs in Vegas!","Date of stay: September 2022","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

Hotel is still awesome. Location is somewhat isolated - so unless you have a car dining options will be limited. Even with car you will need to drive a moderate distance for many dining options. Grocery store relatively close. (by car).  Separate adult and family (general) pools. Good size beach area with plenty of chairs. Large exercise room. Our one disappointment is the snorkeling off the resort beach was not as good as it was 20 years ago - previously we saw turtles every time and lots of fish life - this year no turtles and very limited fish.

Rooms overlooking pool will hear music during day and early evening. Quieter rooms are garden view. Super responsive elevators - never had to wait much. Pools and beaches relatively uncrowded. However restaurants frequently do not have reservations available I would recommend making them in advance. Restaurant and bar closes at 9 PM. Great breakfasts. Free guest self service laundry room including free detergent.

On-site dive operation - fairly small with limited capacity for boat dives. Pretty easy to get shore dive arranged, but if you want boat dives probably should reserve ahead of time. 

Large balcony with table, 2 chairs, sofa and large ottoman. Free in room bottled water.   Rooms very quiet no room to room noise. Large balcony with table 2 chairs, sofa, large ottoman and drying rack. Room has body wash, shampoo, conditioner, Q-tips, makeup remover, proximity sensing makeup mirror, hair dryer, slippers, robes, mini fridge, in-room coffee maker and safe.","Date of stay: May 2022","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

My brother loved their French toast. The portion was huge and the bread was very thick and delicious. It was by far one of his favourite meals on the island overall. 

The avocado on toast and the prosciutto & pesto on toast were very delicious and full of flavours. 

We also had a açai bowl to share between three which was very refreshing to eat on a hot and sunny morning.

It starts and ends with the service, which is world-class, on a par or better than anywhere we've stayed. Mel, the bell captain, is the nicest and most accommodating person! We told him we needed our car at certain times and it was always ready for us, including once with two ""heart"" leis on the front seat when we were leaving for a family ceremony. Everyone else was equally nice and attentive, including Charlie, Cym and Cori at the Ha Bar and Grill ... we felt like we were the owners! The beach is small and somewhat rocky but there are wonderful cabanas for lounging, and once you're out there the fish are numerous and there are two large turtles who swim around, oblivious to swimmers. The service at the adult pool was prompt and friendly; they refilled our ice water regularly and checked on us to make sure everything was OK. We ordered a poolside pizza and it was tasty! Equally tasty but fancier was the Canoe House restaurant, and we met the chef and general manager, Matt and Yuka, who were most kind and gracious. And the food was five-star! Our room was fabulous, overlooking the (quiet) adult pool and with a view of the ocean. Service was prompt every morning and evening (with turndown service), the bed was super comfortable and the bathroom was large and wonderful! Forty-one years later, it was a true second honeymoon.

 the management was unable to come up with ideas to entertain children with water despite suggestions such as sprinklers, water balloons or timed entries for the adult pool…..

Parents with no regard for their bare foot children in pajamas running around the restaurant screaming. and climbing over everything.  You can't even escape it at the upscale canoe House.

The good with Mauna Lani - housekeeping, rooms were clean and modern, beautiful lobby, excellent food albeit very pricy.  Canoehouse was the best dining experience we had on the island.

The parts that didn’t make it the 4 seasons: mediocre valet service (lost my car twice and multiple times didn’t have my car ready after calling 10 minutes prior).  Very few planned kids activities when staying at resort for a pool day.  Small beach, small bar and no available 2 hour late checkout despite renting 2 rooms for 9 nights for a steep price.

It is the little things that matter at this price point and Mauna Lani doesn’t quite measure up to the four seasons hotels across the islands.   we will be staying at the 4 seasons next year.","Date of stay: August 2022","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

The hotel is in a great location, and like others state, after the renovation everything looks and feels fresh and updated.
Our room deluxe with ocean views was well appointed with all amenities needed - though a bit on the small side.
Pool area and beach are great; as is the spa and the gym.
With regards to service and value for money, other hotels we stayed at during this trip (like the FS, the Halekulani) beat the Mauna Lani.
F&B was between good (breakfast and lunch) to great (we went twice to the CanoeHouse - the second time we got the tasting menu and asked for pairing drinks and were very impressed). A nice plus, you can BYO if the wine is not on their list. A minus and something that completely puzzles me is the Bed&Breakfast rate we paid for: we got a daily USD 80 allowance for the two of us…but the standard breakfast buffet is USD 55/person. I have never seen a system like that, and when paying USD 2000/night, doesn’t feel like good customer service…
The other attention point is the pool service/policy: they state they have a 30min policy (like we experienced one day, we put our stuff on sunbeds and went for breakfast to find our stuff taken away from the sunbeds upon return…) whereas we have also seen larger groups reserving sunbeds early morning only to show up late afternoon…without a problem. The lady at the pool was also pretty rude when we made a point about this…

So, a great choice and if they work a little on service and amenities, unbeatable.","Date of stay: July 2022","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Given the recent ways Covid has affected the travel and hotel industry, the resort has made huge and successful efforts to maintain the level of service, amenities and personal hospitality they have been known for. The Mauna Lani underwent a recent $200 million renovation and everything is fresh and updated. The rooms are elegant, spacious and bright, there are new pools (family and adult), a fantastic and huge indoor/outdoor gym, lovely spa and multiple dining venues. The food was delicious from simple poolside snacks to casual meals at Ha Lani, and we simply could not have been in a more picturesque location for a couple of celebratory dinners at The Canoe House, one of the best places to eat on the Big Island, imo. What hasn't changed is the sheer warmth of every team member you encounter, some being there from the early 80's when the Mauna Lani first opened. It is like being welcomed by family. Management and staff were always around to say hi and chat, doing everything they could to make a memorable stay. From the moment we were greeted to the time we left, we were able to relax and enjoy our family trip in beautiful surroundings with everyone in our party happy, content and quite grateful.

Also they try and charge for every single thing. The place is here to suck every penny out of you. Costs money to use flippers!  Every small item has a very large price tag.

So Impressed!","I travel to the Big Island frequently and my two favorites to date have been the Hualalai and the Mauna Kea (that beach can't be beat). This was my first stay at the Mauna Lani since the renovation, and I just loved it! The rooms are gorgeous and comfortable, the service is terrific, and the food is great, espeically The Canoe House which everyone agrees is the best restaurant on the Big Island.  So, how does it compare to the other two?  The Mauna Kea has a very devoted long-time clientele and a fabulous beach, so if you are all about the beach its a good choice, but its very tired, the food isn't good (especially the Hau Tree at the beach, which is a bummer), and it just doesn't really feel like a five star resort except for the prices (they don't do turn-down, etc.).  The Hualalai is gorgeous and the rooms and pools are lovely and I love the outdoor showers, but it is a little like Game of Thrones to get pool chairs and reservations given all the homeowners on property, which isn't very relaxing. And its gotten very expensive at 2K+ a night unless you go off-season.  One of my favorite things about the Mauna Lani is that if you have kids, the main pool is awesome!

My family of 8 adults all were greeted with leis when we arrived. My husband and I had previously mentioned that we were celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary and we when we got to our room a plate of chocolate covered strawberries was waiting for us along with a personal congratulations note! The open air lobby and modern setting was gorgeous and meticulously clean, as were the rooms. The beds were comfortable and our sheets were turned down each night. The valet service was fabulous and those guys were so friendly and fast! We appreciated them letting us borrow a cooler for a couple of our road trips and they always had fresh water for us! They truly went above and beyond to make sure we were happy! We had one small issue in our room which was that a little insect visitor got in. It was handled quickly and completely. We even received a hand written note explaining what was done to correct the problem. And the management gave us a basket of goodies for our trouble! Who does that?!  The hostess, wait staff, and chef at the Halani Restaurant were also very friendly and accommodating. When my son caught a spearfish while on a deep sea fishing excursion, and brought it to the resort, the chef came out to congratulate him and to ask us how we wanted it prepared so we could have it for dinner. He prepared it three different ways and it was absolutely delicious! We also loved The Market for quick grab and go options. We truly felt special at the Mauna Lani!

Could use some help in being more environmentally friendly (no water refill stations throughout resort- except for what’s in lobby)…and plastic utensils used for beach service (packets come with plastic knife, fork, spoon and napkin…so whether you need the utensils or not, you waste them by opening the packet just to get a napkin.

The remodel is beautiful, and the property is stunning inside and out.  The service from each and every team member at the hotel was warm, personable, and professional.  Every detail of our stay was thoughtfully designed and seamlessly executed.  The food and drinks were a particular highlight - even at a high end property, I always expect ""resort food"", but the quality of the dining options at Mauna Lani is next level.  Breakfast in particular was excellent, and the french fries were some of the best I've ever had (no mean feat, with the size and complexity of the dining operations here!).  Sure, it's expensive - there are no two ways around that.  But in my experience, even compared to other resorts at a similar price point, Mauna Lani was head and shoulders above the rest.  Overall, an incredible stay, and well worth the ""splurge factor"" on the expense - I cannot wait to return!  

P.S. - one vanishingly small complaint (just to prove this is a real review):  we didn't particularly like the room keys, which are rubber bracelets you wear around your wrist - perhaps a standard room key option could be offered instead?  But the fact that that's the worst (only?) complaint we had after a week is a testament to the incredible experience we had at Mauna Lani.","Date of stay: May 2022","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Overall it is a very nice property that we enjoyed very much though a couple things keep it just short of the very best hotel experiences we have had. 

Pros: 
The main outdoor area at the hotel is really well done and just a gorgeous and well designed area. The pool, outdoor Halani restaurant, lawn, surf shack and beach all connect really nicely into one space.   I enjoy both pool and beach time and you can easily go back and forth between the two or even just feel you are somewhat at the beach while at the pool.  

Beach is pretty nice, much better than Hualalai though not as good as Mauna Kea.  At Mauna Lani you get a 5 star hotel (unlike Mauna Kea) with a decent beach (unlike Hualalai).  We snorkeled right off the hotel’s beach and it was quite good though a bit shallow so tricky entry.

The restaurants are excellent, and the market that serves food and snacks all day is a super convenient thing to have for us.  Canoe House is a really spectacular setting for dinner, one of the most beautiful I can remember having.

Service was generally very good with a couple exceptions (described below). 

Cons: 
The rooms and are very small.  The hotel was redone but the bones are what they were whenever this hotel was built, and the rooms are simply small.  The bathroom is super small. For $1400 per night or whatever we were paying for an “ocean view room with king bed and rollaway couch” I expected to walk into something a bit more expansive.  There are also a bizarrely small # of power outlets (for example none for the person on the left side of the bed). Again a sign that they did not completely gut the hotel but merely refreshed what was there before.

The gym is big and nice and spacious but the treadmills were old and poor quality and kept malfunctioning.   One morning only 2 of the 5 were operating at all and one of those had an only partially working touchscreen.   Not a huge deal, but for this caliber of hotel just buy some nice new machines.

Two disappointments on service. One time no one answered the concierge line after several tries in 30 mins, so we had to go down in person to ask to change a dinner reservation.  More disappointing I sent a long email to the concierge when we left mentioning the above and other issues with the fitness center and asking them to forward to the manager… never received any response. Again I would expect a 5-star hotel to respond to a message a guest takes the time to write after their stay with feedback","Date of stay: April 2022","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

In most cases, we received services we wanted before we even asked for them.  Alex in Guest Services is wonderful; Paola and Sergio in food & beverages and the entire housekeeping staff is lovely.  The resort has been recently renovated and the villa we stayed in seemed brand new.  The resort is making strides towards being more sustainable - such as with their turtle release program and recyclable and re-useable water bottles in the gym, however, I do wish they offered paper and plastic recycling.  It's a beautiful part of the world and it would be nice to see management make serious efforts to protect that beauty.  The restaurants could get a little crowded and bcaked-up, especially at dinner, however, we were there during spring break so, to be fair, everywhere was crowded, on and off property.  Would like to see more plant-based food options at the restaurants.  The vegan, gluten-free chocolate cake at The Market was mouth watering.  The staff was wonderful with arranging excursions and off property adventures.  The resort boasts an on-site biologist and daily turtle talks, as well as a resort dog who ""teaches"" children to paddle board.  What could be more fun?

They did a good job renovating a very dated hotel but keep in mind that this means the rooms are small. Bathrooms only have one sink and can feel tight. For the price of the rooms I would have expected something larger. Also note that dining reservations are required, this seemed annoying as being a guest at the hotel did not guarantee that you could get a table for dinner. We even offered to leave the table within a certain time frame and they would not accommodate. Food and drinks were good but very expensive. Service was also good despite it being pretty busy when we were there (although we were told it was only at 50% capacity it seemed very full). The service was good but did not seem as personal as we have experienced at other Auberge Resorts we have stayed at. 

The location is beautiful and the beach is great for snorkeling. Very safe for kids to play and swim. The ability to go back and forth between the beach and pool is also nice. We enjoyed the walking path and gym was amazing. Overall a good experience but if I was paying the same price I would probably consider another Auberge Property (we had an amazing experience at Chileno Bay).","Date of stay: April 2022","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

It has been the site of many Celebrations over the years-- Birthdays, Family Reunions, and our Honeymoon. Auberge resorts spent $100 million to update the resort, and actually shut down for over a year to do so. The remodel is beautiful with much more comfy seating, an adult pool and hot tub, as well as offering activities that were not available before. Auberge believes in being respectful custodians to the land and its people and their heritage. They now offer some of the most amazing experiences, which I encourage every guest to consider. I have taken 7 Sunrise Canoe Paddle trips between this trip and the trip here last summer, and it is an experience you will never forget. Taking part in how the Hawaiians have traditionally greeted each day for a very long time, and sitting out in the ocean watching the sunrise, is one of the most peaceful and spiritual experiences of my life. I also took the e-bike Petroglyph tour with Uncle George on this trip and highly recommend it. All of the employees are exceptional, and many have been working there for 39 years, and are true ambassadors for the Mauna Lani. I love hearing ""You're back! Welcome HOME!"" from the ones who have worked at the Mauna Lani for as long as I have been coming, and many much longer. The newer employees are of the same caliber--very friendly and happy to be assist in any way they can. I usually come for a week, which is always too short, but this time I decided to stay for 10 magical days. I will be doing that again! I greatly look forward to my next trip to this Heavenly paradise on the Big Island!","Date of stay: March 2022","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The resort is gorgeous, the rooms are clean and the patios are spacious with a big comfy love seat -perfect for morning coffee.  We were here in March for Spring break with our family of 5- including grandma.  We loved the 2 pools- one for over 21- quiet, great for reading and a nice swim.  The surf shack is awesome- we spent a lot of time enjoying the deck- excellent poke bowls & Cocktails served here and the staff is ready to help you book a snorkel or surf trip- they are all so wonderful. Our family loved the snorkel trip. You can easily get chairs at either pool or the beach- the resort was busy but it didn't feel crowded at all. Highly recommend the Canoehouse for dinner- we ate here twice and it was AMAZING!! We also love the HaLani restaurant for breakfast, lunch & dinner- all fabulous food. Kids LOVED the French toast.  You need reservations for dinner so book these before you travel.  Everyone loved the 2 gyms- one on property and one just a short walk away near tennis courts. There is even a resort lab to keep you company- she is so sweet! Free bike rentals - great to head up to the shops or just for a ride.

The facility is amazing - every inch is manicured impeccably - it makes you feel like you’ve been transported.

The rooms are freshly remodeled so they feel very “new.” The staff is helpful, courteous, and generous to a fault with their time and energy. The gym is among the best we’ve ever encountered at a resort - it was so nice to be able to work out at a full gym every day (and not go home feeling like we’ve been gorging for a week). Having free laundry machines on site is a small but thoughtful and fantastic perk - being able to pack a little lighter knowing that we can do a few loads of laundry while we’re on resort is so great!

We hosted 89 guests for a welcome buffet dinner one evening and then also had our wedding on a separate evening with a plated dinner. The event coordinator, Chelsea, was fantastic. She assisted with so many details from menu selection, to bar selection, to doing the layout of tables/bars. The hotel organized the lighting for our events as they were both outside, and across multiple locations. The setting was beautiful! The banquet staff who coordinated both a buffet dinner one night and a plated 6 course meal for our wedding did an amazing job. The food was delicious. (Best wedding food I’ve ever had). And on top of that - the service was top notch. Chelsea didn’t just help us on the front end organizing the event - she remained in the background still coordinating details and helping us get things back to our room. (Groom’s sunglasses, wedding dress). It was like having an extra wedding planner with us. I can’t enough about the service level at the resort. From the front desk, to the banquet staff, to the chefs, to the Kainalu beach sports staff, the pool service, the Canoe House Restaurant staff to the HaLani Restaurant/Ha Bar - Mauna Lani delivers at the highest level. We saw turtles swimming (that we did NOT touch) right in their beach water off shore. We saw whales on our sunrise canoe, and while dining at the fine dining restaurant on the property (Canoe House). The food at Canoe House was so good we went twice. This resort makes it hard to ever leave and experience the excitement the Big Island has to offer because it is just THAT nice and the Kainalu team has so much to offer as far as water activities. The beach sports team at Kainalu were fantastic. The guys on our trip did spear fishing of an invasive species, we surfed, did canoe surfing, and a sunrise canoe (where we heard/saw whales!). Bullet and Ikaika on the Kainalu team were especially gracious to all of our friends/guests. If you have any important personal or corporate event, this is the place to have it. You won’t have to worry about anything because they take care of everything. When we returned to our room after our wedding, there was champagne and chocolate covered strawberries. All of our wedding guests said its the nicest resort they’ve every stayed at, and everyone promised to return. We are already planning a first anniversary trip because the experience was so perfect.","Date of stay: March 2022","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I couldn't recommend more a stay here. Nevertheless I would not come back due to high prices(not in my generic price range) and long distance from home.
The pool area is great and the atmosphere. The canoe house restaurant is just fabulous. Especially I would like to highlight the kids club. Although my kids don't speak English they have been so happy seeing part of this experience. Suche a great variety in offerings was outstanding.
If I would need to mention a negative point this comes around waste around plates and food. I prefer real plates which can be reused instead that everybody is sitting somewhere in the hotel and having food out of a one time use bag.
If you go to Big Island make sure to have a look as well to the other angles of the island. For the best experience I would highly recommend a second accommodation on the other side of the island somwhere around Hilo.

- The staff was friendly and kind at all times. They definitely made us feel special for our anniversary (shout out to Lexi at Halani)
- The food/drinks were amazing. We ate at CanoeHouse twice - I would recommend letting your server guide you vs. the prix fixe menu. Otherwise, we ate at Halani/Ha Bar a bunch and did beachside/poolside drinks/food a few times. Great ingredients and great execution = delicious. Everything is expensive, but that's what you'd expect at a resort of this caliber.
- Awesome activities - Bullet and his team are amazing for all ocean activities. Do the sunrise paddle, it was spiritual. The snorkeling right off the beach is epic - tons of fish, turtles, eels, shrimp. We did yoga 3 times with Blake, Shana, and Angela. All very different but very good. Rent a bike and explore.

The hotel is beautiful and the layout made it feel open and spacious. We would highly recommend if you like a more modern/boutique style hotel and if you have children as there’s lots of space for them to have fun and tons of activities. Our 5 year old loved the kids club and all the lawn activities.  Fantastic food, great market and shops (that opens early), all around a special experience!

It is beautiful, nice gym ( we loved they had pelotons), good restaurant...but last weekend when we were there it was a mad house.  We went for a relaxing weekend and paid $1500 for a night and ended up leaving after one night because this was more stressful than relaxing.  We had kids running thru our yard (we had a ground level unit.) There were tons of kids in the pool screaming, playing, jumping etc so lots of noise could hear from our room...but we were there for relaxation.  Fortunately there was an adult pool area however, the adult pool and chairs were packed with people trying to relax but honestly the adult pool area is not far enough from the kids so it was still quite noisy. I would say this would be a stunning resort to stay at if you have  kids.  It was catering to this crowd. I would not go for business, a couple traveling without kids trying to relax. The beach area chairs were also buzzing with children.  We love children, we have children, but we were trying to have a nice relaxing weekend and thought this would be it...it was not. I just felt I should review this for a couple trying to have a romantic weekend, or someone on business...and let them know to go else where... Our time is precious so is most peoples so they should go to the right resort for them.","Date of stay: February 2022","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_20"

Soundproofing was negligible.  A family next door (room 226) was very noisy, waking us up in the morning and making it hard to sleep at night.  We could even hear their conversations.  At least they moved out after the second night, but only to be replaced by ANOTHER family just as noisy.  We could also hear doors opening and closing above us.

For this reason, and only this reason, we will probably not return to the Mauna Lani.  Everything else was great.","Date of stay: February 2022","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_20"

We have been to Kona many times and typically stay at the Fairmont Orchid but since this was last minute, we chose to burn some AMEX points and splurge a little.  After reading many reviews and a strong recommendation from a friend, we chose the Mauna Lani Auberge.

First Impressions: WOW! I mean WOW! Reviews and YouTube videos do not do this place justice.  The valet folks meet you with Aloha, a lei and cold drinks!  When you walk into the lobby you are going to be blown away.  It is a gorgeous property and quiet! We felt like we had to lower our voices a notch when we spoke.  It is the vibe you get at the Auberge - Quiet and understated. 

Check in: We were checked in super efficiently by Mark who went over our American Express Fine Hotels and Resorts benefits, gave us our room key/wristbands and then we were off to our room.  We missed the elevators and wandered down a hall where we were greeted by a random staff member and asked if we needed help.  Which of course we were lost and needed directions LOL.  Two staff members led us to the elevators and even told us how to get to our room – 474.

Room: We had booked an Ocean View King but were upgraded to an Ocean View Deluxe King.  Our room was nice and overlooked the Adults Only pool and had an amazing view.  Prior to our arrival we exchanged emails with the Auberge regarding any special requests.  My standing request is a square/box fan that I like for white noise for sleeping.  We had a fan waiting in our room albeit a futuristic tower fan that made no noise.  No problem! I called housekeeping who sent up a brand-new white noise machine (still in the box).  Granted room 474 is not ocean front but it didn’t have to be and in my opinion was perfect.  The bed was firm, and pillows were soft.  AC worked great but as is typical, opening the balcony door means the AC shuts off.  Nice touch is the turbo ceiling fan!  We had also previously asked for and received a non-connecting room and never heard a sound from neighboring rooms or hallway.  The bathroom has two sinks and lots of soap and lotion.  The rain shower had good water pressure, plenty of hot water and a handheld wand.  The Malin Goetz soaps and shampoos were in refillable containers and were plentiful.  FYI: the guest laundry is two floors below room 474 (laundry detergent provided).

Dining:  Our AMEX benefits included a $80/day breakfast credit which we used! We ate breakfast everyday of our stay at HaLani and each morning the great ladies at the hostess desk said hello and remembered our names!  We tried several of the breakfast dishes. The Loco Moco was good with short rib instead of the traditional hamburger patty, the eggs benedict with house made sausage was ok but the touted Ube pancakes were just ok.  I mean the Ube (purple yam) pancakes are unique but odd texture and did taste more like coconut than anything exotic.  Overall, the HaLani service was outstanding (thanks Stephanie and Jingle) although the food was just ok.

Prior to our arrival I had spoken with the concierge who was able to snag us reservations at the Canoe House.  We were truly excited to try out the Canoe House from all the rave reviews and friend recommendations.  However, it turned out to be the biggest dud of our trip and made for a crappy ending to our last night.  The Canoe House has an incredible atmosphere and great service.  Although it was warm out, my sister-in-law was chilled, but our server came to the rescue with a loaner shawl.  Great service aside, the food was just awful.  I sent back the garlic fried rice (rice isn’t supposed to be chewy and there was no garlic), my Grilled Kona Kampachi was disgusting (skin on, fins and tail) and smelled like it was way past being safe to serve (I literally smelled it before it got to the table).  My entire meal was sent back. The other dishes served to my family were not impressive either.  For a restaurant that is expensive, I expected better food than this. We simply paid the check and left. 

Activities:  We booked the Mauna Kea Sunrise Paddle Experience ($90pp) with the Surf Shack Activities team who I call the “Ks” (because both their names started with K).  These gents are outstanding! That canoe excursion to watch the sun rise over Mauna Kea was simply amazing!  I highly recommend it!
We hung out at the Adult pool a lot.  Prince (our pool attendant) was an amazing presence as he was always there with cold water, change of our towels, move our umbrella and a speeding bullet to get us drinks from the bar!  We never had a problem finding a chair at the Adult pool. We also watched the Super Bowl in the huge open air lobby.

Overall: We will be back to the Mauna Lani Auberge!  When it comes to service this place is outstanding! Everyone you meet says hello and remembers your name!","Date of stay: February 2022","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We used to come there 25 years ago with our family and there is no comparison.  The design of the lobby and rooms is beautiful.  The pools are wonderful and the service excellent.  My biggest complaint is the cost of food in the restaurants.  Perhaps it has something to do with the impact of Covid.  
We went to the Mauna Lani shops to have dinner and walk around and the only business that was open was the Tommy Bahama store and restaurant and the market.  We were there a little after 5:00 and the center was deserted.","Date of stay: February 2022","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

If I recommend something, you can count of the fact that it's good. The Mauna Lani is good -- very, very good. Outstanding, really. The rooms are understated and luxurious, the housekeeping staff do a great job -- our room was spotless morning and night. The towels are thick, the bed is more than comfortable, and the resort itself is heavenly. The adult pool is quiet and the view overlooking the ocean is spectacular. The beach is just what you expect a beach to be, with an inlet for safe swimming and a turtle hangout a few hundred feet away. The hotel could use another restaurant -- having just 2 restaurants on-site aren't enough when things get busy. Upon our arrival, we couldn't get reservations at either hotel restaurant and we ended up eating at the bar after a wait for a seat there. There should be some tables reserved and saved for hotel guests -- which there doesn't seem to be. Too, the hotel concierge service can be hit or miss. We wanted dinner reservations at Napua and despite being hotel guests for 5-days, the concierge couldn't get us in there, which was odd. Usually, a good concierge can pull a rabbit out of a hat. So, that was disappointing. This said, we left the Mauna Lani relaxed and happy and we would stay here again in a heartbeat.","Date of stay: January 2022","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The interior is beautifully designed yet understated, without gaudy, phony Hawaiiana. In fact, it was one of the best designed resorts I've stayed in, with spacious outdoor and indoor tables and lounges, magnificently high ceilings and a seamless combination of indoor and outdoor spaces. The rooms were spacious and modern (too modern in some respects, with excessively complex light switches and an ipad-type device that was slow to respond.) Service was excellent and plenty of people were on duty despite COVID. Resort staff delivered personalized service and learned our names quickly. The setting is by far the best on The Big Island. While the beach is not as sweeping as Mauna Kea or Hapuna, there is much greater variety, with easy access to snorkelling, swimming, surfing in 12-18 ft waves (January) and a protected cove where even small children could be comfortable. There were plenty of lounges on the beach, though admittedly it was a relatively slow period, right after the Christmas-New Year crowd. The presence of a market, open all day and until 10 pm, offered a welcome respite from the high priced restaurants. We were able to get breakfast and lunch and take them to our lounges for reasonable prices. I have stayed regularly at the Mauna Kea, but Mauna Lani is now my first choice for Big Island vacations.","Date of stay: January 2022","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Everything that normally potentially could go wrong in a resort stay was absolutely effortless, such as check-in.  The public areas are beautiful and open air so it made the issue of Covid less imposing.  All restaurants were also open-air and excellent quality. I highly recommend both Canoe House for an extra special dining experience (it was Christmas week so there were a lot of families with little kids who were tired and cranky which made our dinner a little stressful--hint to new parents: leave your kids with a sitter or take them to dinner much earlier, not fair to the kids to drag them to a fancy restaurant after 7:30pm) and Ha Lani for excellent breakfast and great dinner. There is also a surf shack at the beach that serves more casual fare and great smoothies and other frozen drinks and a Taco stand which was very good.  The beach is gorgeous and the water super swimmable.  We were just standing the water, waist high when 2 huge turtles swam by us--a big highlight of our trip! The staff at the restaurants and the hotel itself is really amazing.  They are very warm and welcoming and can not do enough for you. They were always checking in to see that we were happy.  There is a Goop store and a market with everything you may need for your stay as well as coffee, pastries, ice cream, snacks and drinks and nice quality souvenirs.  Our room was super comfortable and the bathroom was very nicely equipped and had Malin Goetz products.  The pool was wonderful, never had to worry about getting seats there and it was very separate from the family pool so that was great. Attendants at the pool were also amazing and brought us icy water all day and also had waiters from the bar and restaurant readily available to take orders.  The all-around vibe of the resort is relaxing and friendly.","Date of stay: December 2021","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

It was definitely busy although our flight was empty.  Check in took a while because we decided to upgrade to a deluxe ocean suite and ended up with room 661.  Check in staff was very nice especially welcoming our kids with ice cream tokens. The lobby is open air and very beautiful. Valet welcomed us with canned drinks both alcoholic and non. Plus leis.

Back to the room. Gorgeous views of pools, mountains, and ocean. During our stay there were fireworks for NYE and we had a great viewing spot. King bed and pull out sofa for the kids. One very big balcony. Hardwood floor and Toto toilet washlet. Odd thing was our suite was lacking a dresser so no place to put folded clothes. They promptly brought us a dresser as well as a bigger fridge for our stay. Just ask.  They might accommodate you. Staff is very prompt and nice. Some even remembered our names throughout the stay. Housekeeping does a good job and always promptly brought over requests. There is a laundry room down the hall from the check in desk and it’s free. Detergent and dryer sheets are provided. 

We had a daily $80 credit for breakfast and mostly used it at the marketplace to purchase takeaway items to eat poolside. One suggestion would be to replace current mediocre salsa with fresh pico de gallo or fresh salsa. It would be a great improvement. We also ate at Canoe House which was excellent and Halani. Recommend the paniolo steak salad from Halani. Everything at Canoe House is fabulous. One recommendation would be better upkeep of the bathroom in Canoe House. When I visited it was messy and easily the worst bathroom experience on the property. Reservations highly recommended for both. 

Pool experience was great. Shout out to Prince who was an excellent server and so very nice. Surf Shack has tasty poke bowls and drinks. 

We rented paddle surfboards from Surf Shack and had a great experience just inside the protected area. We spotted sea turtles every time we went out. Also got to see humpback whales breaching from the beach one day. We did the paddle and snorkel experience and that was a lot of fun. We saw a manta ray and lots of fish and sea urchin off the reef. Only regret is I wished we would have gone on the 8 am instead of 10 am. 

We tried the spa and fitness room. Enjoyed trying Peloton bike. Spa massage was fine but just be aware there is no steam or sauna due to Covid. It didn’t bother me at all. We are golfers but did not golf this trip.

There are not many negatives to this newly renovated resort. We are picky travelers and FS Hualalai is usually our go to spot on the Big Island. I would say Mauna Lani is right up there. What could take Mauna Lani to FS Hualalai level in our eyes? To me it’s the intimacy that Hualalai achieves through amazing staff and bungalow style buildings. Mauna Lani is too big to get that authentic Ohana feeling.","Date of stay: December 2021","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The glowing overview of the resort property fulfilled our expectations due in no small part to excellent pre-arrival information provided during which time we were able to book airport transportation and arrange for dinner reservations. 

The general layout of the main hotel allows for easy access to both restaurants and pools as well as the beach area, and the elastic wristband given to each guest at check in was by far the easiest way to allow for room access despite whatever daily case engaged in as there was never any searching in bags or pockets for the key. Although I was told the room would be ocean front, it was more ocean view - still pleasant and certainly a spacious, clean, nicely furnished room with a modern somewhat nautical vibe. We appreciated the twice daily housekeeping service, in room iPad on which weather could be checked, reservations made and room service ordered (the latter was exceptionally prompt and efficient). Another feature was the lighting that could be set for day, evening and night brightness. One aspect of the main areas is the design was made to feature the outdoors - while generally the dry side of the island, when it rains as it did for two solid days of our stay, seating areas were considerably impacted so unless guests wanted to be confined to their rooms there was limited seating in other areas. The weather also underscored the importance of advance dining reservations. Shuttle transportation, at no additional charge, is available to on site properties including the nearby Fairmont hotel that offers other dining options. 

Staff were all outgoing and accommodating, with the exception of one beach attendant who perhaps was a temporary employee. Lena, a concierge, provided exceptional service and Mica - the pet ambassador, was simply the best therapy a guest, particularly dog lovers missing their own pets while away, could want.","Date of stay: December 2021","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The hotel and grounds are beautiful.  The staff (Kai, Rhell and Lovely are superstars), the restaurants, the rooms, the amenities are all amazing.  

This was a family trip and our boys loved exploring up and down the beach and in the tide pools where they saw turtles and colorful fish.  They visited the ponds each day to see if they could spot a new eel or type of fish that they hadn't seen.  Finding the cave near the hotel was an exciting adventure that they had to tell all of their school friends about.  The highlight of their trip was meeting the resort pup Mika.  She was so friendly and the boys were thrilled to see her whenever she was being walked around.

We did the morning canoe paddle and the snorkel past the reef with the Kainalu team.  They were knowledgeable, friendly and eager to share about the island and Hawaiian culture. 

The gym is incredible with all of the equipment that you need to make sure that your workouts don't miss a beat.

We loved our stay so much that we extended an extra 2 nights while sitting alongside of the pool.

The photos show how beautiful this property is but they can't convey the feeling that you have while you spend your time at the Mauna Lani. From the welcome that we received upon arrival to the farewell visit from Mika as we left, this trip was perfect.  Thank you for an amazing experience.

Room: Spacious. Clean. New! In-room Nespresso coffee was delicious! Large bathroom with separate “water closet” and rain shower head…the shampoo, conditioner, body wash, hand soap and body lotion so luxurious and fragrant I bought a set to take home!

Mauna Lani is the perfect example of how the little things make a difference. For example, when we pulled up to Mauna Lani in our rental car we were immediately greeted with lais and a welcome drink.  Next, we walked to the front desk where we were told that we received a complimentary room upgrade because it was our honeymoon.  The special treatment did not stop there. We walked up to our room, started to unpack, and within 15 minutes someone knocked on our door and delivered a bottle of champagne with a note congratulating us on our marriage signed by the vice president of Mauna Lani.  The level of service we received blew us away.  We were impressed with everything.  The room was spacious, the balcony was awesome, and we loved the double vanity in the bathroom even more!  The grounds were immaculate, the staff was incredibly friendly, and every inch of Mauna Lani was designed with care and respect.  Mauna Lani welcomes all.  Families hung around the big pool, but you if you wanted peace and quiet, you could escape to the adults pool.  I cant put into words the quality of cuisine the chefs prepared.  Every single was delicious.  We never had one bad experience.  You don't even feel guilty eating until you cant eat anymore because every meal was the perfect portion and was  made from/with the freshest ingredients.  MY husband said playing golf at Mauna Lani was an experience he will always remember, and hopes to return some sometime in the future.  I would 1000% recommend and return to Mauna Lani.  Our experience was surreal in all the best ways.","Date of stay: September 2021","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Staff were amazing from start to finish, impeccable service throughout. 

The main pool is lovely and just at the right temp (feels a little chilly first thing but warms up quickly). I will say it got very busy there and is not a ""tranquil"" pool. It's lively. We didn't visit the adult pool, that space might be better suited to those seeking quiet. Anyway, I love kids so I didn't mind, but between groups of work acquaintances and families, it is abuzz the whole day, more so on the weekends. Lots of events going on - we saw some weddings and quite a few corporate gatherings. Again, I didn't mind them at all, in fact the great live music from them drifted up to our room a few nights which I very much enjoyed. I point it out because it's definitely a different vibe than a resort made up primarily of couples as guests. 

All the dining venues have great food, really great food. We'd come from another very good resort that lagged in that area so it was delightful to get to the Mauna Lani and have a nice place to grab a bottle of wine and a light meal. Also, reserve for Canoe House, excellent dinner and beautiful location. And if you are a foodie, definitely book well in advance at Napua at the Mauna Lani beach club. We had dinner our last night there and wished we'd visited sooner, exceptionally good service and fantastic food. Try the poke! The resort can shuttle you over there, but we walked, it's a leisurely 10 minute walk, just bring your flashlight to find your way home afterwards.

Finally, a word on design. This hotel is breathtaking. You can see how they had to deal with some funky elements due to the original structure. They ran with it and created a lovely, tactile, visually stunning set of public areas.","Date of stay: October 2021","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The rooms are spacious enough and quite comfortable, and enjoy twice a day housekeeping. Nespresso, high quality tea service, and the resort's own bottled water are refreshed during each housekeeping visit. The views from the rooms and balconies are awe-inspiring, as are the views from any of the ocean front walking paths on this very large property. The multi-floor lobby/interior is as peaceful a haven as you could imagine, with multiple seating areas, soft music, and the fresh ocean breezes blowing thru. The highpoint of the resort, as incredible as the physical property is, would be the staff. Each staff member greets you warmly and often by name, and will spare no trouble to fulfill the smallest request. Shoutout to Elliot and Kyle in the Valet/Bellman area--they were not only a font of information about Hawaiian lore and traditions, but they actually made it feel like ""coming home"" when we would return to the resort from an activity/expedition, many of which they had themselves recommended.

We chose to come in mid-September, which is ideal due to great weather and more relaxed setting (fewer kids).  From the beginning, when a manager came by at check-in to welcome us, to our room (which was a very nice, comforting Oceanview King with a great balcony, away from the main lobby and elevators), to the great dining (two meals at the Canoe House, with the best sunset around, and a couple breakfasts and one dinner at Halani), to the great pools (we alternated between adult and main pools, which are both relaxing and have their own distinct attributes), and the beach.  The staff is also well trained and friendly, which is something that can be hit and miss at other resorts.  We were sad to have to leave at the end of our stay, but we made up for it by already booking our next 2022 stay at the Mauni Lani.  The resort is definitely not inexpensive ($24 for a hot dog and fries at the pool, although it was one of the best hot dogs I've ever had!), but you definitely are paying for a luxurious experience.  We also had a great time on our outrigger canoe snorkeling trip, just off the beach from the resort, with a super friendly staff at the surf shack.  Things we may adjust for next time:  we'll book our ground transportation in advance from the airport; we'll try to take better advantage of walking path along the ocean; try to take advantage of more hotel sponsored activities.","Date of stay: September 2021","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Most activities are close by the resort plus they will shuttle you to locations such as their golf course. With RACs super-expensive nowadays, this could be a significant savings.

The ML is located on a large ocean front property heavily landscaped and meticulously maintained. The entrance is beautiful and welcoming. The interior of the hotel is more ""outdoors"" than indoors. Fresh ocean breezes flow throughout the massive lobby area which includes many comfortable seating areas, water features, Hawaiian artifacts, and even a learning center. I enjoyed many hours lounging in the lobby.

We had an ocean front room which was fine - not wonderful. The ML is expensive and my expectations for the room were not fully met. A recent renovation looks effective at updating the interior. I know this is a non-specific comment - but I merely thought, for well over $1,000 @ day, that my room would be wonderful.

There are two lovely pools (three of you count the kiddie pool) and both have large hot tubs. Pool seating is comfy, well-cushioned lounge chairs plus large umbrellas are nearby. One pool is adults-only which I thought we wouldn't use but we were surprised how many guests had little ones with them - so we moved back and forth depending upon the noise level.

There is a private beach on the property which also includes lounge chairs and drink/food service from the hotel. I found the water portion of the beach to be extra rocky so I didn't go there much. The breezes are very pleasant.

The Ha Bar includes a terrific open-air (but covered) oval bar and an open sided restaurant. Next to the ML is The Canoe House restaurant which is lovely. Both are pricey - but everything at the ML is pricey.

TIP: Put on your walking shoes and walk to the private beach area. Turn left and skirt the shore for a lovely walk experience. You can make the walk as long as you like. Lovely.

Once we realized the nature of our visit to The Big Island was mostly to hang at the resort, we shifted into a super relaxed flow and loved our time there.","Date of stay: September 2021","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Down to the last detail in guest rooms, such as dimming evening and night lights, the overall experience was spectacular. I'd describe the decor as 'modern zen'. Infinity pools inside and out, lush vegetation, calming and inviting common areas. Even 4,700 miles away from home, we'd consider going again. 
Dinner at the Canoe House is a must-do. Go before sunset for an extra special treat. We travel all over the world and have high expectations. Our dinner, highlighted by server and ad hoc sommelier Dean, ranks at the top of our list for dining experiences. Well done! 
As expected for Hawaii, food is very expensive. Prepare for that and it will be much more enjoyable. However, quality is very good, even at places like the Shack adjacent to the beach. Freshly made poke bowls were a welcome treat for an afternoon on the beach. Beach staff have chair covers, towels, and individual ice water jugs and cups ready for you. 
Wear water shoes or strapped sandals for the beach and going in the ocean. The sand is not fine and sugary. But you're missing out if you don't take a dip. Bring goggles or a face mask, and you'll probably be treated to at least some sea life such as a sea turtle that hangs out off the main beach area.","Date of stay: August 2021","Trip type: Traveled on business","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

But not one captures a painfully trendy, Miami Beach/Manhattan vibe like the newly imagined Mauna Lani - and that’s not what we want when we stay in HAWAII. 

The new decor of the Disney Contemporary hotel lookalike ranges from a HGTV 2 hour design challenge, to a food/gift shop that looks like Dean and Deluca, to smallish rooms that are sterile white with tied rope as a headboard (I’m sure there’s a designer story about tying all choices into the Hawaiian fish ponds, but the result here is white, cold and industrial). The low point is an elevator with 70s gold veined mirrors and brass accents. 

Gone are the fascinating tropical fish ponds in the atrium of the hotel, replaced with more of the moment furniture and ferns. There are two colorful murals that seem a last ditch effort to link the hotel to the place, but  they too read as forced.

The staff, in non-Hawaiian, Gap navy polos and chinos did their jobs, but the aloha spirit is very low.

The food, as other reviewers have noted, is average at best and needs more local influence. 

The shockingly undersized pool could be a resort anywhere - rectangular, rows of lounges, upright and far from the shore. Then beach is not the best for swimming but much better than the  Four Seasons. The friendly beach staff was very helpful and the insulated water jug was a thoughtful touch. There is a small kids pool with sharp corners and no creativity. 

A fun, opposite the hotel, beach “shack” is a welcome reprieve from the rest of the hotel - but needs better food, drink and merchandise offerings. It could also use more shade structure. 

The worst part of the new Mauna Lani is that it feels anti-place, and anti-hawaiian. It’s also viciously expensive for the product. Instead of improving the resort and making it unique and timeless, the owners have placed the hotel into a dated design that screams “2018”, says noting of place, and is already dated.","Date of stay: August 2021","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_20"

We had a great stay!

From the moment we arrived, everyone was so gracious and kind. From the valet to the pool attendants to the waiters, everyone was very welcoming. 

We booked a package that included hotel credit to spend each day which we mostly applied to meals. And thankfully we found the hotel food from breastfast at Halani to poolside lunch to dinners to be fantastic. Even the poke bowl and breakfast sandwich at the Market were great. We never had a bad meal! The team is super attentive, always noticing if we needed water or bringing over a contraption for the flies that circle around (no fault of the hotel since it's all open air dining). Definitely make reservations though, we learned the hard way that the hotel books up fast for meals!

We also really appreciated how they handled the breakfast buffet in the morning, still allowing the feel of a buffet but having it feel safe for patrons. We also saw the manager approach a table and kindly asked that they wear masks while in the buffet area - he handled it like a pro and we definitely appreciated the attention to this. 

We did one dinner at the Canoehouse (booked through the concierge) and that was such a treat - loved having oceanfront views and the sunset. 

We never had an issue grabbing a chair by the adult pool (easier in the morning) and a beach chair. We specifically booked this hotel as we thought we'd have an easier time in booking chairs than if we had gone to another island. But we had no issues whatsoever. The beach itself is a bit more rocky and less soft sand and the water isn't always calm. But great snorkeling, lots of turtles to see. We also grabbed towels from the valet and drove up to Hapuna Beach for a beach-y day. 

Gym was great, we liked that they had a fair amount of machines outside and that they had big doors to bring the fresh air inside (masks are required while in the gym). Also liked that they had multiple pelotons. 

Our room overlooked the adult pool and was very pretty outfitted. I liked that they had bracelets to open the doors, so much easier than keeping track of a key! We did notice that we had absolutely no cell phone service in the room which was odd. Wifi worked fine but if you had to do a phone call, you had to go on the lanai. I also wished there had been more towel hooks/bars in the bathroom. I did appreciate the evening turn down service. The fridge also didn't get super cold, was fine for drinks but not sure I'd keep any food in there. 

Overall we had a great stay and I'd gladly stay here again. The kindness of the entire staff was so great (definitely bring cash to tip folks - valet, pool/beach attendants) and the very pretty grounds made for a great vacation.

We mostly just rented houses as we liked the freedom, but did tend to use the resort for a few days each visit.  The general issue with this strategy is that sometimes it doesn't feel like a vacation, as we are still cleaning up, doing laundry, and cooking some meals.  

This year we decided we wanted to be pampered, so we just booked hotels rooms at the Mauna Lani.  I am so glad we did.

The improvements to the hotel were noticeable everywhere.  Not only does it now look great (we thought it felt a little dated before), but it actually feels great.  From the moment you are at check-in, you 'feel' like you are in Hawaii.   Its just a different feeling than we get anywhere else in the world.

We loved some many things, it hard to write them all.  Among the changes that made it better to us were the new pool area (with the grass area leading to the surf shack), the redone breakfast area, and the updates to the rooms.  All of these were well thought out and executed.  We also loved the grassy area in front of the Canoe House, where the kids could play while we waited for dinner.  And finally, the staff.  They went out of there way to insure we had an incredible stay, which we will always remember.

As with everything, there were a couple of things to take note of.  First, they did get rid of the fish at the entrance, which we always enjoyed.  And second, we ate at the Canoe House twice during our visit.  The first time was a complete miss (strange food combinations at downtown New York prices) and the second time was just ok.  Luckily there are a number of great food options around.

When we compare the other hotel options in this area, we always feel like there are three luxury options, the Four Seasons, the Mauna Kea and the Mauna Lani.  All are great, but it depends on what you want.  

We love the Four Seasons, and have stayed at many around the world.  But we do not love the lack of beach here and feel the prices have gotten too high.  And while the food options are terrific, we have always felt that we are confined to 'campus'. 

We have only visited the Mauna Kea for dining, beach and golf.  But we find it a little too crowded for our tastes.  

While the Mauna Lani feels a little more laid back.  A place you do not need to rush to the beach at 6:00 am to reserve seats.","Date of stay: June 2021","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The hotel itself is absolutely gorgeous. The lobby is filled with trees and Hawaiin plants, as well as unique wood furnishings and very high open-air ceilings. The rooms were so comfortable and had HUGE balconies looking out onto the ocean. 
All the food and drinks at the hotel were incredible. I especially recommend the Canoe House. The tables overlook the beach and have firepits next to the ocean. The food was insanely delicious, as were the drinks.
The service at the Mauna Lani was top tier. For example, during our stay, I, unfortunately, had a severe allergic reaction. We called the front desk and the manager Alex organized for one of their security employees named Tolo to drive us to urgent care. Tolo stayed with us through the 2-hour wait at urgent care and could not have been a nicer and more generous individual. During a scary time, he truly made us feel comfortable, taken care of, and safe. We are forever grateful for the way the hotel handled the situation. Alex even gave us a 5 pm check-out that day as we were leaving that night. 
Also a huge shoutout to the hotel's entertainment. RJ who is an incredible, Grammy award-winning artist played at the restaurant every night. We felt like we were getting a personal concert every night and afternoon at happy hour and could not be more grateful to have gotten the chance to see him play.","Date of stay: August 2021","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We absolutely love it! It's the perfect Hawaii resort experience. The property is gorgeous, food is delicious, staff is friendly and attentive, decor is contemporary, rooms are perfect. We love everything about this place! We spend our days alternating between the fabulous pool and the calm swimmable beach. There are comfy lounge chairs everywhere and staff ready to serve. Everything at the Mauna Lani is effortless. Be sure to book your dinner reservations when you book your room! We like to eat at the Canoe House for dinner and the Ha Lani for lunch. Breakfast is usually lattes, pastries, and smoothies from the Market. We had the best massages ever at the spa! I forgot my workout clothes and was delighted to find great biker shorts and bra top at the new Goop Store. The paved paths around the property and neighboring places makes for gorgeous running routes. We saw turtles at the beach and tropical fish. Gorgeous sunsets every night.

There is a Goop pop-up and a well appointed marketplace where you can pick up everything and anything including poke, alcohol, breakfast burritos, jewelry etc.  We were there as Covid was surging. The staff were uniformly masked, and guests were instructed to wear masks in the enclosed common areas, including the gym and spa.  Everything is outside so we felt reasonably safe.  The resort was packed with families and lots of children.  There are two pools, one the adult pool where we mostly stayed except when on the beach.  The beach itself is so-so, not expansive white sands, but the swimming was great, and the resort offers a variety of water sports - all for a fee.  We had an ocean front room that was fairly standard but our smallish balcony had a wonderful view and a relatively comfortable small couch.   We understand the resort was recently renovated and it is lovely but it reminded us of a Hyatt with its open interior flanked by rooms on all sides.  The room was tastefully decorated but in no way amazing.  It felt like a big hotel at a beach rather than a resort.  There are limited cabanas available for the entire day for a hefty fee - none were available to us during our 7 day stay.  There are two restaurants, one - the Canoe House is a spectacular 5 star restaurant, but the other -the Ha Bar & Grill was distinctly mediocre.  There was not one memorable meal - standard fare at best.  Unfortunately reservations at other places near by were not easy to get - Hawaii seems to be a popular destination for anyone from the States - and probably from elsewhere too, but most people we encountered were from the mainland.  We were very leery of going anywhere that didn’t have outdoor dining but we did go to a few very unspectacular places.  The Canoe House we saved for a special occasion on our last night and it was worth it.  Covid definitely has had an impact on staffing shortages and we found the service to be very friendly but uneven in quality.   We recommend highly for families with children, but wouldn’t choose to come here again as two adults.  When we go tropical we want a true resort- and we want the food to be excellent - in that sense this hotel disappointed.","Date of stay: August 2021","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

It was sophisticated but still relaxed. We enjoyed al the different types of spaces to hang out in the extended lobby, and the delightful amenities from the easily accessible market, particularly early morning coffee and pastries. The location was convenient to many areas of the island. We had the hotel arrange a snorkel trip on a catamaran, and a helicopter tour. Both were highlights of our stay. We did not feel that this hotel catered to a particular type of traveller, but felt very comfortable to all types. It also seems like the design of the hotel makes every room have a nice view.

The kids actually preferred the Mauna Lani and I can understand why. The layout of the resort offers freedom for kids to roam, while a lovely adult pool will appeal to couples seeking a quieter, kid-free experience. While you can still see the bones of the old hotel building, the renovation is gorgeous, colorful, stylish and welcoming, with lush landscaping and plenty of spots to sit and enjoy open air spaces. The sandy beach is smaller than Mauna Kea, but better than Hualalai, and there is some decent snorkeling on site. I think what we loved most about the resort was having the Market and the Surf Shack as food and beverage options rather than the more formal poolside/beachside service at many resorts. When traveling as a family, sometimes your kid wants a snack, or you need a coffee, but you don't feel like having to sit down at a restaurant or wait half and hour at you chair for it. Our kids loved the independence of grabbing an ice cream at the market or picking up snorkel fins at the Surf Shack on their own, and the open green lawn between the main pool and beach had a lovely communal feel to it, with groups playing lawn gams and kids doing cartwheels long into the sunset. The only negative is the food was very uneven. Fish dishes were overall good as was breakfast, but the only vegetarian offering--a pasta dish--was almost inedible. But with some work on the food the Mauna Lani has the potential to replace the Four Seasons as our new favorite resort on the Big Island.","Date of stay: June 2021","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Truly felt like a dream from check in to check out. This does come with a price however, so be prepared to pay it.

No fault of the resort, but was unfortunate to see how privleged some of the other guests acted towards staff and in general. Just because the price tag of this hotel is high does not mean you can disrespect everyone who is working to make your stay better. 

Be prepared to spend a fair amount of money at the resort, without renting a car most taxis will cost around 50 dollars to get anywhere away from the resort, and while the resort car is nice it does not take you that far. There is a grocery store within walking/resort car distance if you want to try and save a little money on prepared meals/alcohol. 

Would highly recommend checking out canoehouse however, truly a prestige dining experience. The breakfast and lunch options at halani did not seem worth the price however, often would spend around 100 dollars for two on breakfast for nothing special and after 6 nights the lack of selection seemed to stick out. 

If i stayed again, renting a car would be a must because of these issues but other than lack of selection in lunch/breakfast options i cant find much to blame on the resort.","Date of stay: July 2021","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The Mauna Lani is spectacular. I visited here with my parents for a week stay and everything about it was amazing:

The hotel was recently renovated - it’s open and spacious inside with a lot of greenery on the bottom floor. The rooms are great (you should pay attention what type of room you want - first floor that goes straight to the pool? Ocean view? etc … take your pick. And they’re very clean.

The service here is amazing. Everyone was super friendly from when we were first greeted having arrived at the hotel to everyone at the restaurants to folks at the Market as well as the Surf Shack, and more. Food was delicious and again, everyone at breakfast, lunch and dinner were so nice! They would remember our names and always had a smile on their faces. Some of the people who work at the Mauna Lani have been here for years!! And you can tell for them the resort itself is a family :)  Chatted with Jenny who helped us with our chairs on the beach - she was so friendly and super helpful and she talked about families came back year after year which was nice to hear! I honestly think it’s because of the people. The Market is great for a lot - morning coffee, banana bread (you gotta get that early - it is soooo good), souvenirs - from shirts to hats to coffee to kids stuff, and the ice cream is homemade and delish.

The activities, oh my gawd! Go check out the Surf Shack. Had the opportunity to get to know Ikaika, Silvia, and Ian, among others (they were all AMAZING and so cool!) for some of the activities (snorkeling, etc). The activities (which were a BLAST! — could literally come back and do a totally different set of activities) would not be as fun if it wasn’t for the people - can’t emphasize that enough. They were awesome - should I call them “instructors” or “guides?” - honestly it felt like they were your best friends when you went out on the water with them!

Uncle Danny! He’s the best! We took a walking tour with him, and our only regret is we wish we did MORE talks with him (on the weekly activity guide he does the ones like ""Historic Walking Tour"", ""Tales of Old Hawai'i"" etc). He’s super knowledgable and incredibly friendly! He’s one of the people you can tell is the heart and soul at Mauna Lani - I could say that about a lot of the people in fact! I spent time talking to him after the tour too - super cool guy.

Visited the gym a couple of times at the end of my trip - should have gone sooner - it’s a gym that has everything you need (did a couple of Peloton rides).  Didn’t go to the Spa but I’m sure it’s wonderful and will save that for next time.

Since remodel the  lobby and common areas are beautiful throughout. Rooms very good.  Beach is nice with good snorkeling but a short walk to Mauna Lani club beach where snorkeling and SUP excellent.  

Mauna Lani does great job of really letting you know you are in Hawaii.  The preservation of the farming ponds are great with great walking all around. Don't miss on site historian Uncle Danny's walks every day.  The sunset outrigger trip is excellent - book well in advance. E-bike tour is okay - good family event.  Bring your own snorkel gear if you have it to save some money.  Canoe House excellent food - book well in advance.

Only two small areas that could be improved.  Service is hit or miss - Connor at the pool was excellent but we also had some pretty iffy service at the Ha pool bar and restaurant - some people clearly had just been hired and weren't sufficiently trained. Other item would be to add steam and sauna to the fitness area.

Although large and close to capacity, it was ""intimate"" and never felt crowded.  The pools and beach are spectacular. Unlike some resorts, there were plenty of lounges available at the beach and pools, so no need to stress about it and claim your lounge in early morning.  The children's day camp was wonderful, engaging the little ones with a well-planned schedule of activities that changed daily with lovely women running it.  My two young grandsons went every day that we were at the resort for a week and loved every minute.  The cultural experiences are enlightening, and I loved making leis with my granddaughter and the historic walk.  Thoroughly enjoyed the sunrise  paddle experience and appreciated the recommendation and work of the pre-arrival concierge that helped immensely with reservations.  My only disappointment was the lack of restaurants and variety.  The Canoe House, the signature restaurant, is outstanding and rivals the best of the best in NY and LA; however, it can be difficult to get seating and the food would not be appreciated by youngsters.  The Halani/Ha Bar was the only other ""family"" option, except for a very limited and uninspiring menu at the Surf Shack.  Since we preferred to stay on property, we ate a lot of meals at the Halani/Ha Bar but found the food rather average or below, boring, lacking any creativity and island flavors and way overpriced for the quality.  Service was inconsistent, but delightful, friendly staff, always trying to please made things ok.  I suspect there will be  improvement in all areas after the rapid escalation of visitors post Covid is resolved.  Good menus for the kids.  I would love to see a sushi bar and actual lunch and dinner menus rather than lunch/dinner (one menu) with specials on a daily basis to bring variety when you are eating there a lot.  I heard that Chef Matt of the Canoe House will now oversea food services, so I suspect that things will improve greatly.  Expand the Surf Shack to include tacos and salads.   My only other complaint is that my room has no floor length mirror nor the hooks (perfect) for hats.  I don't understand how some rooms have this and others don't, as a mirror is common even in 3 star hotels.  The spa has no steam or sauna, but the massage was relaxing and perfect for me.  Again, difficult to get any reservation if you didn't make it in advance.  There were little mistakes made, but again I think due to how quickly service was ramped up, that added up.  All and all, this is a place I will definitely return with my family.","Date of stay: June 2021","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

What a beautiful property - modern design meets Hawaiian culture - with interesting features around every corner. Our room (Ocean Front) was well-appointed and provided a front row view for each evening's gorgeous sunset.  

It was clear the property was having some growing pains (as it's reopening was scaling quickly), but the staff was always friendly and helpful. Our interaction with the concierge before arrival really helped to get reservations at Canoe House (which apparently needs advanced planning) and a couple of excursions (both the Sunrise Canoe & Petroglyph/E-Bike Tour were excellent Experiences). Advance reservations are highly suggested at offsite restaurants as well due to the fast influx of vacationers and/or continued Covid considerations). Check-in, out were both seamless. We did not utilize the spa facilities, however, so I have no input there.

The one element that needs attention is restaurant/bar options. For restaurants, I'm referring to places where guests can dine in a shaded, seated setting. Therefore, I'm eliminating The Market (takeaway sandwiches, etc.), the Surf Shack (which is a small grill with limited outside seating - mostly used for takeaway pool/beach eats) or Room Service.  

What's left is Canoe House (incredible food, but limited availability & only open for dinner) and the ""combo"" restaurant (HāLani for breakfast that turns into Hā Bar and Grill for lunch/dinner). A single location for breakfast is typical, but one menu for lunch/dinner becomes tedious after a couple of days as the options are somewhat limited. The menu at Hā Bar and Grill does not even change between lunch and dinner.  

If you include breakfast, lunch, and dinner, we had 11 meals in the same space during our stay. That's just too much. No complaints with the food quality, however, as the offerings were quite good. There simply needs to be another dining option somewhere on the property - especially as the number of guests grows. As a result, we only ate dinner at the property twice (once each at the Canoe House & Hā Bar and Grill).  

For bars, there's only one (Hā Bar and Grill) as the Surf Shack ""bar"" is limited. The Hā Bar is absolutely packed in the late afternoon/evening (as it's the only real option) and probably needs an additional bartender to accommodate everyone (including pool orders). Again, I would suggest another bar (placed in the stunning lobby) to space everyone out. 

Would I return here? Absolutely! Would I suggest this resort to others? Absolutely! But to give the property the ""fifth star"", I believe there should be alternate options for dining and cocktails – especially at this price point. 

Highly recommended!","Date of stay: June 2021","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

The recent complete renovation shows. Feels very modern without the usual over-the-top Hawaiian decor. 

The service was generally excellent, although at times a little spotty, perhaps due to ramping up post-COVID. 

This would be a 5-star review if not for the inadequate (in terms of number and capacity) of restaurant and bar facilities.   One go-to breakfast/lunch/dinner restaurant, a small pool bar, and 1 ”fancy” restaurant with a 2-week wait list is simply inadequate in an area that otherwise has limited off-property restaurant options.  Furthermore, the single outdoor bar was crowded with limited seating. (The addition of an indoor cocktail bar seems an obvious necessity). 

Despite this, a beautiful place to vacation.","Date of stay: June 2021","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

In fact, each day, it got better and better, such that by the end of our time, our daughter asked if we could  add a day or two to the end of our stay! (LOL, we ALL WISHED we could have!)

The food at Ha Bar and Grill was SO GOOD and atmosphere SO beautyFULL that we canceled 2 of our dinners out to stay “in” … and we LOVED IT, each time!

The service all-round at the Mauna Lani was extraordinary – I don’t  know how they hire their team, but whatever they do, it’s working! Friendly, engaged, kind, thoughtful, happy, helpful staff from the moment we checked in until we checked out! 

Tips:
Get up at sunrise and take walks/hikes on the Fisherman’s Trail – which runs around the entire island, right through Mauna Lani! To the south, it’ll  be on volcanic rock-cliffs with the ocean crashing below – to the north, it’ll be just a few steps from the ocean. Bring snorkel gear for when you get hot, plenty of water, and some money in case you want to stop for a drink at one of the resorts along the way.

Spend ample time at the Surf Shack and make sure you take advantage of their water sports program, which is FULL of not only adventure, but deep cultural learning opportunities and great love! The sunrise canoe, outrigger surfing, snorkeling, floating on a boogie board or stand-up paddle boarding are all INCREDIBLE! Everyone there is wonderful – we had the joy  of getting to know “Uncle George” and Nick, along with Bullet and Ian.

Allow plenty of unscheduled/excursion-free time to BE and BASK in the beauty of Mauna Lani. 

Unparalleled!
We spent a bit of time at some of the other luxury properties in Kona and NONE OF THEM came close to the feel and the beauty of Mauna Lani. The open-air, multi-story entrance is stunning and always seems to have a cool breeze blowing through, the grounds are immaculately cared for, and the restaurant-pool-beach-ocean elements are wonderfully intertwined! There is a feeling of ohana (family), rich connection with the people and culture of Hawaii, and a sense of beauty that is unique and unparalleled.","Date of stay: June 2021","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The concierge helped us to get a reservation at Canoe House (which was fully booked at the time) and reserved a round of golf for my husband and brother-in-law for a great deal.

We have stayed at the ""other"" 2 Kona coast 5-star hotels, but prefer the intimacy of this resort - all local staff, smaller property, less congested beach area, less ""stuffy"" feel - just like Hawaii should be.","Date of stay: May 2021","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Some may say that the private beach is smaller than other resorts but the overall ambiance more than makes up for this.

It’s *almost* as nice as the four seasons but a lot less expensive. In my opinion it is the second nicest hotel on the big Island and the next nicest (Mauna Kea or maybe Fairmont) isn’t even close.  I live here and do Kamaaina stays a couple times a year at a few of the hotels. And while four seasons is still my favorite, Mauna Lani is BY FAR the better value. 

Even though the hotel was full when we stayed, and the pools were busy, we were still able to easily get pool spots and great service. 

Canoe house is AMAZING. The grounds are beautiful and little details are everywhere in the design. This hotel is an Instagram influencers dream! 

Also, our room had a stack of nice throw blankets to use on the balcony. I have never seen that at any hotel before and what a nice touch!","Date of stay: May 2021","Trip type: Traveled with friends","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We’re discerning travelers and have stayed at Mauna Lani pre-renovation (loved), Mauna Kea (wanted to love) and Four Seasons Hualalai (liked but for its crowded feel).  We’re currently at the Mauna Lani now and wow. Just wow.  In my experience, hands down no other hotel on The Big Island that compares.

The sense of place abides. The staff is genuinely warm and still has that tightly knit community feel. Plus, our pre-arrival communiques with concierge Aulani were kind, extremely helpful and efficient.

The property renovations are gorgeous and in keeping with an eye towards nature. Breezy walkways and inviting sitting areas abound. Our room is beautifully appointed. I love the slippers!

The Mauna Lani is everything we hoped for and more to welcome us back to the island of Hawaii after craziness of the past year.  You will be happy here, too.","Date of stay: May 2021","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Really well done and we were well cared for. Our room was fantastic, large, well appointed and comfortable. We had a lovely view and balcony. Adult pool is gorgeous and calm, beautiful view and great service. Food at the pool, BTW is ok, but could really be better. The yoga and surf shack staff were excellent, and we enjoyed all they had to offer in classes and water adventures. But wow, not a bit of difference day to day. The bars all have the same drinks every day -- and the same drinks at the pool AND at Canoe House, just in different glassware, there are no specials at the restaurants, the fish of the day changes, but it's prepared with exactly the same sauce/same sandwich/same salad/same tacos day in and day out. Canoe House, Surf Shack, coffee bar, poolside. Same menu day in and day out. Music is on an endless loop. Classes don't change. No beach to walk on, not a lot of snorkeling unless you book an adventure ($100-$180/hr) to go out past the first reef. Snorkeling beach to the south, very crowded. Bikes available, but no place to ride to other than a small grocery store and a defunct shopping center. Cab rides to other resorts (which are very, very tired looking) will run you $80-$100 per round trip and you can wait up to an hour for a cab. We rented a car for a few days - great to get out and see the island. This resort has so much going for it, but you really have to work at it to go off property (concierge would help with specific requests, but they won't tell you, for example, that there is a Merriman's on the island -- or a Four Seasons when you ask about options for nice dinners). We felt a little trapped - no shuttle or walkable/rideable options - and little variety day to day. Would be easy to fix, but maybe the idea is a four day stay?","Date of stay: May 2021","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

I have previously stayed at Four Seasons resorts, Fairmont, Andaz, and Hyatt properties throughout Hawaii. After pulling up to valet we were greeted by one of the bellmen who then offered us a shell lei (there were plenty of kukui nut leis as well...maybe we needed to be in a suite to get those?) and either a canned fruit juice or Hawaiian beer from the nearby iced cooler. We then walked into the lobby which was very beautiful and open air. Next, walked to the check-in desk and spent less then five minutes completing some paperwork then was told which way to head to the room. The room was clean and had a modern beach vibe to it....not bad. When I booked I did pick a premium ocean view room, however it was really just a view of the lawn area and the pool. You cannot see the ocean unless you step out into the patio and look to your right....a little disappointing and misleading compared to what the Mauna Lani site shows online.  The property grounds itself were very beautiful, such as the historic fish ponds. The beach is a small cove, that was a little rocky but was able to see some fish and fairly shallow and calm water. Now as far as food goes at Ha Bar and Halani...we did only eat a late lunch and dinner,  but I wasn't really blown away by any of the food options. The menus to me did not really reflect any local Hawaiian cuisine...the usual fish tacos, fish and chips, poke...nothing spectacular. I was honestly surprised to see people comment they enjoyed the food here...maybe if you are from Cali and just enjoy plain items like those and pizzas then yeah this is for you. The only place of redemption was CanoeHouse, make sure to book your reservations in advance...even though it wasn't even that busy. We did the tasting menu and was finally able to enjoy a nice meal on property. The restaurant is located right by the beach and watching sunset while dining was breathtaking.  Upon check-out we did order room service breakfast which was another bust. I was sad to see no local breakfast items...no fried rice! They did have Portuguese sausage so I opted for that with eggs, but with my mother's meal as well and an $86 tab.. it was definitely a lacking breakfast experience. I will say that I did enjoy the local staff and how friendly they were, especially Nelson working valet. Would I come again?....probably not... I felt a lack in having any type of personal experience and very limited food options. ...like I said if you enjoy that Cali vibe of fish tacos and gluten free pizza then sure this is the place for you, but why be in Hawaii then? I think I will stick to what I know and for about the same price I will stick to the Four Seasons.","Date of stay: May 2021","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

Our daughter enjoyed many days at the Keiki (Kids) Camp, she learned about sea urchins and turtles, made sea shell earrings, saw petroglyphs and caves. The kids pool is perfect for babies as was a small section of the beach. It is not the largest beach on the island but we found it perfect for our small children. In fact, we left the hotel as planned after 5 nights to go to one of the hotels with larger beaches but after 2 nights there we came back to the Mauna Lani as we missed the quiet softness of a beach with less undertow as well as the wonders of the tide pools and beauty of the lava rocks.

The location is very beautiful, but a series of events made the overall experience stressful. 

Staff were very slow at the adult pool over the weekend sat/sun at the start of our trip (improved M-T).

All activities were booked, no assistance was provided by the concierge to help us find things to do. Very unhelpful and slow to respond.

All spa activities were completely booked. 

Dinner reservations were completely booked. We got lucky with canoe house which was pretty incredible on two separate nights. 

Morning breakfast would take 45 minutes to get seated.

Overall my impression was that the hotel overbooked guests the week we were there, and kept the same COVID-19 reduced staff and restaurant schedules. Didn’t understand the rationale of this other than “money grab.”

We basically ordered room service and sat in the hotel all day. Honestly can’t complain too much, but just wasn’t what I was expecting given the reviews I had read.

The chefs at the Ha Bar and Grill were able to accommodate a unique request we had and fed us two tremendous dinners that I will dream about for a long time to come. CanoeHouse and the Market were great options as well.

Its breathtaking upon first waking in. The staff are wonderfully accommodating and always with a smile. A few nitpicks. Out side of the night table there are no outlets in the room to use which can create a logjam when charging. Also the concierges were not particularly helpful. I asked about the CanoeHouse restaurant and was told it was entirely booked the entire week and to even some waitlists were booked. I gave Niko my name to be placed on the wait list for the week and never heard back. Luckily my wife just walked up to the hostess one night and she asked and yes they had three different available times. Maybe a bit more coordination.

There are lots of beautiful beaches in the world: what makes Mauna Lani special is the sense of place and genuine warmth of the people. It was wonderful to see Zelda and Edwin at the front desk, Binky at breakfast and so many other familiar faces from the bell desk to the tennis courts. Linking the staff and guests to the history and culture of Hawaii is Daniel Akaka. He continues to graciously share his knowledge through a variety of cultural programs. He is the glue that holds the place together. The rooms are beautiful. The facilities are lovely. During the renovation and pandemic many long time employees retired. There are minor changes you may be nostalgic for, such as the koi at the entry or sea life swimming in the ponds throughout the property. Kudos to management for getting things ready-to go from shutdown to 85% capacity with families on spring break (during a pandemic!) in a few months is a herculean task.

Service and Property. Now we love the Four Seasons and Rosewood resorts and have been to other Auberge properties and given the 7 day cancellation policy versus 30 days for the Four Seasons we thought to try here given Covid unknowns.

The Property is beautiful and we had a one bedroom ocean front suite for our family of three. The room and two decks were well done, remodeled and have amazing views. The pool is fantastic but the beach is average at best. This is not a beach property by any means. The gym when open is really nicely done as are the tennis courts and locations to Waimea, great hikes and places to eat out. They have rented out the gym in prime hours during the week to individuals - so do not expect to get to use the gym in the afternoon. There are running and walking trails but still something we had never seen before at a resort - especially an Auberge. We were told by an employee they did this to make extra money even though it would be a problem for all other guests. That employee also told us that if we wanted to rent any 'public' space for an hour for our family they could arrange it for a fee.

The food is far below average (sans Canoe House which is 5 star). There is one restaurant for breakfast and lunch as well as the beach shack - where the couple items off the grill are better than anything from the restaurant. For breakfast each day it suffices though.

Service is a place where this Auberge needs a lot of growing. We would rate this zero to one star at very best. One of the managers even told us they are having trouble recruiting the type of employees that will get it to the 5 star they want.

 Now a few people are just GREAT though: thank you to Carlos, Nik, George, Kai, Erma, Alex, Beata, Jayce, Manaia and Kaihulni (Beach shack). Now I would expect them to be at a Rosewood, Aman, Four Seasons or any 5 star property. For the rest of the service this correlates to an All Inclusive, Lower Cost in town Cabo Hotel. It is hard to believe that an incredible brand like Auberge attaches its name to them at current service levels. 

Normal morning this is the scene - you would see snorkels, hats and books on pool chairs at 7 am, families eating breakfast and lunch at the pool by making sandwiches and food bought from a market. Fully skipping the breakfast place or poolside service. Not something you witness normally at a five star resort with an Auberge name on it. They need to get the pace similar to other 5 star properties.

The area is amazing - some five star restaurants like Merrimans, Browns, Canoe House (on property), Napua (can walk to this), Sushi spot at Four Seasons and even a fun (terrible food but amazing view) Luau at the Mauna Kea. Would suggest doing these each night as the restaurant at the hotel is the same spot where breakfast is served and the poolside food is made. Farmers market in Waimea is so much fun as well and awesome food.

The property has the making of a 5 star hotel and resort but it is far too big to ever be a quaint luxury property like the and Aman, Four seasons or Rosewood which is just fine. We would absolutley recommend it but also let people know what to expect from a stay there rather than think this is a quaint, luxurious Auberge property they are so well know for having. With the Four Seasons down the road and a Rosewood coming to Kona in 2023 it will be interesting to see how the Mauna Lani fits into the comparisons with them and the beautiful, grand, timeless Mauna Kea.","Date of stay: March 2021","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

The rooms are clean, modern, and nicely furnished, with all the best amenities. We enjoyed relaxing on our balcony with expansive views and watching sunsets, which were even more awesome at beach level and while enjoying happy hour music and beverages on the lawn outside the surf shack some 50 yards from the ocean.

The resort has a relaxing, serene vibe to it. The Halani outdoor restaurant and Ha Bar are great for casual dining. Canoe House is the signature restaurant on the property and highly rated. Golfers will enjoy the manicured and scenic North and South Courses, the latter with signature holes along the ocean.

We stayed a week in February and while we did venture out every once in a while, we could easily have stayed at the resort and been perfectly happy.  We stayed in an ocean front room and had views of the whales every day from our lanai (and sometimes even just laying in bed!).  Early on in the week, we went on a sunrise outrigger paddle and it was amazing.  Kala and Josiah at Kainalu Sports were on our outrigger and it was fun, beautiful, and spiritual.  It really encompassed what the Mauna Lani is about - the aloha spirit.  I tried booking the sunrise paddle again - it was that good - but they were booked for all the mornings that we were available.  Food overall was good, but Canoe House was great.  For a nice meal out, Canoe House and Merriman's are the best options on the island.  Covid protocols were in place everywhere and we felt safe the entire time.  I loved that they checked everyone's temperature when they came into the resort.  It's not that intrusive and you get to chat with whoever is doing the check.

To go back and find some of the same people still there at the newly named Mauna Lani by Auberge Resorts was simply amazing. Of course the hotel has been completely remodeled since then (probably a good thing) and our sixth floor room overlooking the pool had a very nice sunset view and I highly recommend that side of the building. The indoor/outdoor gym was amazing and glad it's open 24 hours as I hit it mostly around 4:00 or 4:30 AM. The Ube Colada is super good and other meals were good as well, but it's good to get out of the hotel and have dinner in other places like Lava Lava in Waikaloa. We also did the Sunrise Paddle which was fun but also kind of touristy and I enjoyed yoga on the lawn as well. Bikes are complimentary and so was the Turtle Talk. The Market has some really good snacks, pastries, etc. but you can find most things for much less down the street at the Foodland. There is a also very good Juice Bar down the street with huge Açai bowls. Worth the walk or ride.","Date of stay: March 2021","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I love the location - the whole Mauna Lani complex feels isolated in a way, with the hotel located in the heart. While the hotel does not have a great beach, it is an easy (~10 minutes) walk north to the Fairmont (small cove) or south to Mauna Lani Beach Club (Makaiwa Bay), which has great snorkeling. The pools are great, very clean and refreshing, with a small, shallow sand entry kids pool for the little ones. The entire staff is awesome, very personable and welcoming. What is unique about this resort are the experiences it offers, from the various cultural talks to the Kainalu crew who run the sunrise canoe paddle (awesome experience) and other ocean based activities (outer reef canoe snorkel). The resort's signature restaurant (Canoe House) is top notch, great setting and A+ food, but book well in advance as reservations are hard to get on short notice. The fitness center is one of the best I've seen at a hotel with top notch equipment and an outside area, with sleds, box jumps, punching bags, etc. Overall, just a great resort.","Date of stay: March 2021","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We've lived on the Big Island five years now and stayed at all the resorts for weekend breaks and this was no exception.

As before, the renovated rooms are comfortable and what you'd expect.  Other than lacking an electric toilet seat and minibar, you have pretty much anything you'd want.  Kidding on the toilet seat though, having a heated bum massage is a bit over the top for us.

Beach is not the best but their pools are quite nice and the adult only infinity pool is a stand out.  Because vacancy was perhaps fifty percent there was no problem getting beach chairs or pool chairs even with the social distancing of same.  Getting restaurant reservations can be a bit more challenging than you might expect due to local condo and home owners in the area booking and with fewer tables the possibilities are less.  This visit we ate at the pool bar, which has a nice seating area and the food is quite good.  Particularly enjoyed the chocolate brownie with ice cream and carnalized banana.  That with chips and sliders, and a couple glasses of wine, hit the spot tremendously.

The near fist fight ... we went to Canoe and sat at the bar one evening and were told we could order dinner there.  They have two seats next to each other with appropriate pandemic spacing between each pair of chairs.  All well and good.  Except unfortunately it seems that the space between the seats was looked upon as an invitation to come up and stand at the bar next to the seated patrons by some, who insisted mask wearing was not for them nor respect for the distance set up by the local health authorities.  This led to a confrontation and the male bartender kinda hit out and the female server looked terribly embarrassed by it all.  Management needs to step in and help when entitled, boorish guests insist on flouting these regulations and putting others at risk.  

This then is my core complaint about the hotel.  The rooms, food, staff and facilities are top notch.  The beach is just ok but there are activities and efforts to maximize opportunities for the guests to enjoy it.  But we saw over and over, to the horror of local staff, the disrespect and general entitled, boorish attitude by some of the guests that detracted from the experience.  I also wish there was a more Hawaii-centric vibe ... yes, there are some decorations and artifacts (glad they got rid of the African mud cloth)  but reggae and country western music?  No local musicians?  And their phone message mispronouncing Mauna Lani?  Not cool.  

So ... bottom line, you are a wealthy Californian wanting to get away to Hawaii, want to talk loudly with your friends at the bar and poolside, don't really care about public health measures because hey, they shouldn't apply to you, want to feel catered to by staff who pretend not to notice your behavior ... you'll love it here.","Date of stay: February 2021","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

We came for 3 weeks and ended up staying 8 weeks. The resort has 3 pools, 2 sandy beaches, 2 surf breaks, healthy reefs for great snorkeling, 2 restaurants on site plus a short walk/drive to additional choices, state of the art gym, and a staff with endless aloha. The Mauna Lani is environmentally sensitive and respects the surrounding historic Hawaiian sites. From the resort, we hiked the King's Highway Trail to Waikoloa and the Fisherman's Trail from Puako to the Black Sand Beach. Along the trails we saw ancient fish ponds, petroglyphs, cave shelters, drop dead ocean views, billionaires idea of beach shacks, snorkeling sites, turtles, and whales. The Surf Shack staff tailored activities to our interests from paddling to showing us how they remove invasive fish species from the reefs. Our evenings were spent enjoying the HaBar, Halani and Canoe House Restaurants. The food choices were varied and the quality excellent. Recommend the Halani pizzas especially the Shrimp Pizza and anything Chef Matt Raso prepared at the Canoe House. Our favorite dishes at the Canoe House were the Corn Riblets, the Bread, Radish Salad, Pork Jowls, Lobster, Garlic Fried Rice and the fresh fish.

Apparently it was very tired before the work. The main restaurant (Canoe House) is great, the breakfast-lunch restaurant is cool and the new main pool bar is also very nice. Staff is excellent. The Aloha spirit is alive here especially among the sunrise paddle outrigger crew and Mel who helped us with our bags then noticed we were struggling to secure an Uber ride to the airport so offered to drive us the 30 minutes to the airport in his own car, which delayed his arrival home on his wife’s birthday! Mahalo, Mel. The property has a dated exterior look but sits on a lovely location. Rooms have been delightfully updated but, again, dated architecture and pretty small. It was quiet during our stay, guessing 25 percent occupancy. We honestly think that during a post-covid summer with high occupancy it would feel very crowded — can’t see the pool space nor restaurants coping with the numbers. The pool bar and restaurant currently close around 6pm, which leaves just one restaurant on property for dinner. When busier they’d absolutely need everything open. If you come here, just a 10-15 stroll down the coast path is a great local restaurant, Napua. They have their own farm, warm atmosphere and a magnificent wine list.

Reception area... gentleman behind the counter greeted my partner a happy birthday & upgraded us to a deluxe ocean view room.  Resort also gave my partner a few gift choices for his birthday.  We picked the complimentary “pastries & two 16 oz coffee drinks” which were perfect for afternoon tea time.

Beach attendants:  set up lounge chairs for us... provided us with towels... opened up umbrella for us... and supplied us with 2 glasses & a cooler filled with ice water.  While we were basking in the sun... an attendant came by with complementary yogurt shots.

We checked out snorkeling fins from the surf shack.  When we returned... I asked the attendant where we can get some dry towels.  Instead of telling us to go get it by the pool area... he told us to wait while he went to get us towels.

We had breakfast everyday at the Halani restaurant... server remembered us & greeted us with an “aloha, Mr. Tio”.  I asked our server where is the honu pond.  Instead of just pointing us to the direction of the honu pond... she went out of her way to get us a map of the property... marked the map... and told us a little bit about the honu (turtle)program they have & how they release the mature turtles into the ocean every 4th of july

Aside from stellar service... the resort offers a beautiful atmosphere & a nicely equipped gym on the ground level with indoor/outdoor workout areas.","Date of stay: January 2021","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We were super excited to go back after the big renovation and we hoped that the hotel had become a little more luxurious. The prices were nearly twice as high as pre-renovation. 

Unfortunately, post renovation, little has changes. It is still a nice, relaxing hotel, but not one that's worth such a huge price increase. The rooms were tiny, with only minor changes to increase the style. The pool and beach area were also different, but only moderately, to again make them more stylish. The food was no better than pre-renovation, arguably even worse (our soft boil eggs were all hard boiled). I'm willing to have some empathy because we are in the midst of Covid, but if I'm paying what I paid, I expect better. The price didn't match the experience.

The big renovation seems like an excuse to bump up prices when the product is the same, albeit more instagramable than before. However, I wasn't there to post on instagram, I was there to have a luxurious beach vacation. 

Despite my grievances, it was a relaxing vacation. The staff was lovely and they are not to blame in any way for my disappointment. I just don't feel like I got what I paid for. With a smaller price tag I'd have been pleased, but with this big price I'd rather go to a different hotel. So I'm sorry to say that my love affair with the Mauna Lani has ended. I won't be going back. 

Some specific things (besides the prices) I disliked: small rooms, no desk in room, eggs cooked incorrectly, food only good (when for what I paid I'd want outstanding), they messed up our taxi to the airport bringing us close to missing our flight home, no option to reuse towels or do other environmentally friendly things, no bar snacks with our million dollar drinks, no snacks in the room, unless you got the expensive fruit plate the fruit was mediocre, etc. These are all prissy little things but when you pay such a price you expect some of this. 

So, Mauna Lani, I recommend either lowering your prices or upping your standards. I'd pick a four seasons over you any day. But again, the staff was lovely. I'm sorry I won't be seeing them again.","Date of stay: January 2021","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

She personalized our stay at the Mauna Lani to give us the best wedding experience we could've only dreamed of.

My boyfriend and I went to Mauna Lani for New Years and had an incredible time! Growing up, I visited Hawaii often. I used to stay at Kona Village Resort and haven't visited since the resort closed in 2011 from the Tsunami. Highlights of our stay:

- COVID concerns: They sent us instructions ahead of our flight to make sure we were aware of the COVID requirements (flying from out of state). All staff wore masks and were cautious about social distancing. The resort was far from feeling crowded so we were able to keep to ourselves easily. Our rooms were always thoroughly cleaned and they even provided us with additional cleaning supplies. Overall, we felt very safe during our stay.

- Service: The staff went above and beyond the entirety of our stay. Before we even arrived, the team reached out to us and helped us with booking. Huge thank you to Tiffany and Lana. Kasey (with concierge services) booked us a taxi from the airport and sent over the resort's schedule of activities before arriving (thank you, Kasey!). Upon arrival, we were welcomed by Cy who greeted us with drinks and leis. It truly felt like he welcomed us like family. The staff at the front desk, pools, and beach were also helpful and timely. They often came around offering delicious smoothie samples (felt like every hour!). We even came to feel like we knew some of the staff, which was refreshing. Special shoutout to Kat who was so sweet and helpful. Thomas also often walked around greeting guests and would routinely check in with us to ensure we were enjoying our stay. Overall, A+ for service. 

- Room: Beautiful. Absolutely beautiful. Our view was gorgeous and the bed was one of the comfiest beds I've ever slept in. The tech in our room was modern and the TV was easy to navigate. The staff promptly cleaned rooms and had turndown service. Literally, my only critique about the room is that the toilet room seemed oddly dark. 

- Amenities: The pools and beach were all beautiful. The pool chairs were very comfy and they provide each group/set of chairs with a mini water cooler and glasses. Since the resort wasn't crowded, we were always guaranteed a pool or beach chair at anytime (no waking up early to ensure we could get a chair!). The adult pool is slightly heated as well. We loved the lawn - they have games like corn hole, spike ball, and connect four. One of my favorite things was the live music they had at sunset on certain nights.

-Restaurants: The Market provided an easy option for a quick breakfast or lunch. Halani was delicious (would recommend the fish tacos) but our dinner at CanoeHouse was a meal I will never forget. Our dinner was incredible... even if you don't stay at Mauna Lani, make a reservation at CanoeHouse!! You will not regret it! 

- Activities: The resort offers a bunch of activities but we participated in the sunrise canoe paddle (on New Year's Day), bikes, and the New Year's Eve event at the shack. The highlight was probably the sunrise canoe paddle. Uncle George helped us navigate the waters smoothly and provided some inspirational words for the first day of the New Year. 

Overall, we had an unforgettable trip in all the best ways. I can confidently say that we will be back and already can't wait until we visit again. I couldn't have imagined a more perfect way to end 2020.","Date of stay: December 2020","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

After a long day of travel getting to Hawaii, we were greeted by Alex (I believe the resort Assistant Manager). 10/10 welcome experience - Alex made us feel so special upon arrival and was helpful in finding us a room that best suited our preferences. From that point forward, Alex made a point of taking care of our group...he went above-and-beyond in helping us with external dining reservations and was also helpful in getting us a reservation at the full Canoe House restaurant on-property (which he helped us with on several occasions). Speaking of Canoe House...wow! This is near the top of my list of reasons why I would come back to Mauna Lani. The food was exceptional. As several reviewers have previously noted, the pull apart buns are unbelievably delicious. Other reasons why I would return to this hotel include: good beach, GREAT gym (including 3 Peloton bikes), great overall hotel feel (the lobby is stunning), and top-notch service.

A couple of things for hotel management to take note of on a go-forward basis:

1) WiFi gets a 6/10. It should be 10/10. There is nothing worse than slow WiFi, especially during the times of WFH or WFV (working from vacation). Allocate budget to improving this, please!
2) For some strange reason, no one in my group ever got a really hot shower. We had warm showers, but there were clear issues with the water temperature in our room.

We had not been previously and were planning  to stay at the Four Seasons.  A colleague with a family home nearby told us about the renovations and the reopening. I looked into it, there was a bit of an opening deal, so we decided to try it. 

We booked a room with a full ocean view because that's important to me. I was not disappointed. Our favorite hang out was the adults only pool. We tried the restaurants, more than once, and thought the food and service were great. We went to Canoe House for bday dinner and tried the recommendations, loved everything. Try the breakfast buffet at least once at the other restaurant 

We took advantage of the free offerings, the historical walk is a must, snorkeling, feeding the turtles and the non-complementary ones like the sunrise Canoe ride (day before they saw whales, we didnt see any, but did see them at other times), yoga on the lawn. I would recommend all. We also went on a sunset cruise, walking distance from the hotel and recommend doing that.

We would come back here. If price were not in the equation, the other is still our favorite, but it's ok to like more than one place.

The grounds are incredible--tidal pools to snorkel in; walking the fish ponds is fascinating; the turtle program is informative; the hammock ont he beach is PERFECT! 
And the overall feeling of the place is welcoming elegance--a difficult thing to achieve, but the Mauna Lani has mastered it!  Perhaps most impressive was the sheer number of people across the resort who actually called us by name while we were there--that is unbelievable!  SUCH a personal touch...SO impressive!
Caroline Shone is unbelievable--we love her!  So lovely, so gracious, so personable, and she goes above and beyond at every turn.  When she heard we were there celebrating our daughter's 21st birthday, she even brought her a birthday gift including a hand-calligraphied and framed birthday message while we ate dinner!  I have NEVER had anything like that happen before!!!  She is utterly the best.  We also loved Thomas--so welcoming and kind and outgoing--he, too, is lovely!!  SO fun, made us feel SO special!!
The Bungalow was outstanding in every way!  I still can't believe how wonderful it is--gorgeous art; perfect furniture; lovely slippers and welcome gift and beautiful private pool, fish ponds AND a waterfall?!?  Truly...truly...THE best.  Most comfortable beds ever...incredible bathrooms and outdoor showers...fully stocked kitchen...scrumptious coffee (What WAS that?  So good!)  Even a telescope...and backgammon game...and loungers by the pool...and the list goes on and on!!
The Canoe House is an other-worldly treat of a restaurant--it was THE BEST.  The corn ribs and pull-apart bread were among the most delicious things we have ever eaten anywhere--we want to come back just for those!  The ambiance is superlative, the service impeccable, the food delicious...I cannot say enough.  Watching the sunset over the ocean from this oceanfront restaurant is sublime--once-in-a-lifetime.

There was not even floor space for all of our suitcases.  It was tiny.  For the price, I was expecting much, much more.  Everything was impeccably clean, but the beach is really rocky, snorkeling was just okay, and there weren't good waves right out front to boogie board.

So badly that we had starting staying at The Four Seasons Hualalai for the last 4 years.  We just love The Big Island.
Well.... let me just say the newly renovated Mauna Lani, now an Auberge property is just simply a WOW!!  The renovated property is spectacular with fabulous rooms (we had an high floor, ocean front room), beautiful common areas, upgraded restaurants and improved menus, fabulous beach and great new pools including an adults only infiniti pool.  In addition to the beautiful physical property, the staff is simply awesome.  Everyone, everywhere is friendly, attentive and well managed.  Apparently Mauna Lani ""stole"" some management from the Four Seasons and it shows!!  We got to meet the GM, Sanjiv Hulugalle, who was frequently visiting with guests.  Sanjiv is a gem, and runs a great ship.
I believe Mauna Lani is now one of the top properties in all of Hawaii, and certainly on The Big Island.  Anyone who has stayed at Hualalai in the past, definitely needs to give Mauna Lani a try.  You'll simply love it and make it your new favorite resort.
Shout outs to Lovely and Jingle at breakfast, Gayle at the Ha Bar, and Jennie at the pools, all of whom have been there for nearly 20 years.... like coming home!!
P.S. also love the Mauna Lani golf courses... only the South was open, but in great shape!!  You have to play #15 from the Black Tees... you won't regret the short hike!!
Also felt incredible safe everywhere on the Island... double screening coming in and all staff wearing masks and random COVID screening.

Still needing a break from work we decided on the Big Island. We've stayed in other hotels in the area but they seemed dated and in need lf a facelift. The Mauna Lani has gone through an extensive and thorough $200 million renovation which I understand took over a year. The hotel reflected this and was beautiful. The location is excellent as well. There's a nice beach right in front of the hotel. I heard the snorkeling is great right out in front. The water was calm and very safe while we were there. There's also miles of trails along the ocean or through the ancient fish ponds adjacent to the property. The rooms were comfortable and well appointed. They had a mini fridge stocked with water and a coffee maker! They will leave disposable coffee cups with lids at your request. We had an awesome ocean view looking over the pool and lawn and we loved looking out at the sunsets.  What really made our visit great was the staff. Everyone was great and so kind and helpful and full of aloha. I'd like to thank Pam for assisting us with our reservations and Bullet and Scotty at the beach shack. The Bell staff are all great, friendly and helpful. Mel was our bellman upon arrival who happens to be a great guy too. If you're thinking about staying in this area of the Big Island, I would not hesitate to choose the Mauna Lani.","Date of stay: November 2020","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I’ve stayed at so many resorts around the world and this one is magical.

It has the best of everything in one place on the island of Hawaii - the true spirit of aloha, loads of cultural activities, a fabulous beach with tons of water activities, a surf shack, 3 pools including an adult pool, tennis, golf, a spa and so much more.

It’s an open air hotel, and they have the strictest protocols of the hotels open on island so I felt super safe being there during covid.

The rooms are newly remodeled and the views are stunning. I haven’t slept this well for months. I even forgot to bring my phone to breakfast one morning which never happens.

They have the best restaurants on island which is rare for a hotel to have. I don’t think you’ll want to leave the resort but if you do, you can walk along the water north to another hotel and south to a beach club that has Napua. You can also walk to the Mauna Lani Shops that has Tommy Bahamas and a grocery store. So many options.

The hotel is super kid friendly. You can tell all the kids enjoyed as much as their parents, maybe more.

We didn’t want to leave. I highly recommend staying there and can't wait to go back!","Date of stay: November 2020","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Whenever I travel to a new or revisit a destination, these previous experiences can make it hard for a new place to live up to expectations. When I think of my recent stay at the newly reopened Mauna Lani I find it hard to come up with one word that I felt appropriate to describe my experience but landed at ""flawless"".

The arrival experience is in my opinion one of those that can be difficult to craft and that sometimes gets overlooked by hotels.  What made my arrival at Mauna Lani flawless was the fact I was made feel as if I had been there before.  It was warm, kind, familiar and genuine.  I felt as if I was returning home which absolutely set the right tone for my stay.

Loved the contemporary design of the resort as it is refined and upscale while still giving you the sense of place you expect in Hawaii through customized woodworks, textiles and through the art collection around the resort.

Fabulous pools,  awesome beach and unbelievable snorkeling await. Meticulously manicured lawns and gardens and golf course though I'm not a golfer.

The many dining choices make for a great culinary experience.  HaLani and HaLani Bar, The Market and the Surf Shack all fantastic, unique and different.    The Catalan Stew and the Shrimp Croquettes at HaLani are a must!  

Pampering, relaxing, exploring the resort and its many activities and cultural program provided the perfect escape from 2020s crazy.  Cocktails at the pool helped escape to oblivion and made life just wonderful.  

The staff at Mauna Lani is simply spectacular.  Authentic and kind, not rehearsed.  Anticipatory, not obtrusive....in the end, a great family. 

In summary, what I tried to convey is simple. Mauna Lani is exquisite!

However, they sure missed a lot of key points. They put a new spa in but only offer 5 treatment rooms, no manicure/pedicure and no other services besides massage and facials. There is no nice relaxing pre or post rooms. Therapists were great, but again not within budget - close to $300 for a standard massage. What they don't tell you is the gratuity IS included in the price, so if you tip the normal 20% you made a mistake! Way over priced in my opinion and ocean ""view"" rooms many are obstructed. No happy hour or specials and the Canoe House? WOW, plan on bringing a lot of money, place is WAY over priced and very slow service, which I think they do on purpose to have you order more drinks, which there is nothing less than $9.00. I agree with another review, maybe visit this hotel for a drink and lunch but don't waste your money staying her. Go to the Hilton or a B&B. Staff was hit or miss, some at the front desk were helpful, others barely gave you the time of day. Service at the poop was horrible, they set you up with a towel and water, if you are lucky they see you looking for a chair, but the service for food and drinks was not around. In order to be a true 5 star rated hotel, they need to improve the ""guts"" of the hallways, walls, etc., lower their prices for food/beverage or offer a special and increase their staff by the pool to accommodate all guests. We were there early March and the hotel was around 90% occupancy, but staff did not reflect. Sometimes room wasn't cleaned at 4 when people go to their rooms to get ready for dinner.....

Our room was ocean front on the first floor which was exquisite!!!! View was beyond beautiful. The room was decorated to perfection and beyond clean. The only time it wasn't private was when someone held a yoga class right in front of our balcony. Check on yoga schedule before booking this room.  The two swimming pools were immaculately clean with views of the ocean and both outdoor hot tubs were the perfect temperature with few chemicals. The swimming beach was perfect and we saw beautiful fish and large sea turtles snorkeling right from the hotel. We ate at Canoe House three times it was so good. All the other restaurants were excellent too. This review is not exactly fair because there were very few guests at this hotel due to the pandemic. About the time we arrived the hotel closed to the public so that made the Canoe House available and quiet for dinner any night we wanted. This restaurant is usually packed and even hotel guests must make reservations. It felt like we had the entire resort practically to ourselves which is so rare and not typical of a Hawaiian resort. We cherished every minute but would it have been the same under normal, crowded circumstances? I don't know. One bad thing happened: we were told several days in advance that the hotel would be closing down and all guests would have to leave. Luckily by that time we had 6 glorious nights.  When the hotel announced the upcoming closure the staff got wind of several guests who planned on extending their stay in Hawaii via VRBO or AirB&B.  These guests, including me, were contacted and told that there was a rumor that the airport was going to close the following Tuesday - the day before the hotel closure. All my common sense and intelligence and that of an even naive and simple minded person said that this was nonsense and it was. The staff wanted to send a message to tourists to get off the island. I don't get it  but in general I felt VERY welcomed by EVERY local we met in the hotel and out and about while shopping and touring.  I am grateful to the Mauna Lani for accepting guests around mid March and staying open as long as they did. I don't know if I'll return because I am now spoiled by visiting this hotel at 10% occupancy which is unheard of - a fantasy really that will most likely never happen again.","Date of stay: March 2020","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

First off, the renovations are amazing and a few of the highlights for me included: state of the art fitness center, incredible hotel common areas, brand new pools (especially loved the adult pool), and beautiful new rooms. Everything is well-designed, clean, and well-stocked. I especially love that they do not use plastic in their rooms, and instead stock the fridge with ice-cold water every day. There is plenty of space in recreation, beach, pool and common areas, making it possible for you to really enjoy quiet time if you need it. The location is excellent as well, with easy access to the fish ponds for a morning walk or evening run, and access to some of the best snorkeling I have seen in my life.

But by far the best part of Mauna Lani is the staff. Luxury hotels are a dime a dozen, but Mauna Lani is set apart by the way the staff interacts with its guests. We always encountered smiles wherever we went and every person who helped us was gracious and invested in our happiness. 

I highly recommend booking an outrigger experience with Kainalu. We booked two and our experience was magical both times with Uncle George, Kala, and Josiah. They showed us snorkel spots beyond our wildest dreams and taught us to listen for whales under water! I also recommend turtle talk with Pi'i and Ethan. We learned so much about the program and how much good it has done for vulnerable turtle populations. Pi'i is a turtle whisperer and has a lot of incredible knowledge on what are, in my opinion, Hawai'i's most beautiful creature.

In addition, we had exceptional poolside service from Chelsea, who always knew when we needed refills :) and Tayler at Ha Bar. Ian at CanoeHouse gave us incredible service on our last night there as well, making this trip truly special for us. We knew we would be back when we had our first snorkel...but the employees sealed it!

Yes, the hotel is new. Yes, it has kinks. But the bottom line is, don't let surface ""imperfections"" rob you of a truly meaningful (and luxurious) trip. The food is pricey, but if you need to budget, there are great local places in the area to support as well. Plus...it is sometimes fun to leave the grounds :). This is the best hotel to stay at on this Island if you want a vacation that is equal parts luxurious getaway and adventurous fun.","Date of stay: March 2020","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We came several times to the “old” Mauna Lani many years ago and we were very excited to hear about the remodel. To begin, the update is spectacular. The hotel looks great and both the common areas and rooms are first class. Can’t comment on spa or gym as both were closed down due to the virus. 

The staff however does not live up to the reputation of Auberge. They seem under enthusiastic and perhaps under trained.
That can be fixed with training and time.

The hotel is recently renovated and although it was my first time there, I could tell that the design elements and ambiance of the grounds really aimed to put the guests in a Hawaiian sanctuary... peaceful, beautiful, tropical, meditative are some of the words that come to mind.  BUT, it looks like the renovation stopped short of complete, especially as you walk out of the lobby and towards your room, the hallways seems extremely dated,may be circa 1960?   The hotel from the outside looks like it could still use a facelift.  

We had an oceanfront room which was extremely well appointed with modern decor with some Hawaiian touches.  The ocean and sunset views from the room were unforgettable.   Very modern and clean.   BUT, the whole Lanai was looked dated and metal railings looked to be original to the building.   Small nit, but if you are going to spend $$$$ and over a year to renovate why not go all the way?

The pool areas, both family and adult pools, are beautiful, clean and inviting.   BUT, the poolside service really tests your patience.  The attendants are super nice and friendly but trying to get one of them to come to you required ‘some’ effort.   In short they are short man power.   Yeah first world problem, and you are laying on your lounge chair with nothing to do but catch rays while waiting....but still.   

The restaurants.  Canoe house is WAY over priced.  Wow.  If it wasn’t for the convenience I would have never eaten here.   Food is good, not spectacular, but EVERYTHING is ala carte.  The other restaurant is pretty good, still expensive but not as exorbitant as Canoe House.   Please don’t gouge the patrons.   Yeah go ahead and charge resort prices but Canoe house was a bit over the top.

It's an understatement that we were delighted to work with event master-of-all-trades Marissa Romero at the Mauna Lani, who jumped into helping us choose menus, ceremony, reception sites & ensured our (sometimes demanding) guests were content.
Bar-none was her multiple sweet gestures & encouragements -Marissa worked TIRELESSLY to execute our wedding (special shout-outs to Laura Creider & Lana Linhart for their air support/ calming presence). 
A standout moment was the dinner service during reception - which was almost militant in its efficiency. Our guests were served tasty courses one after the other & were VERY happy with flowing drinks. We came back to our room to grilled cheese sandwiches & a handwritten card w/ Polaroids of the ceremony from Marissa, knowing we didn't get much time to eat since we were busy dancing the night away. 
Her above-and-beyond touches made us look at each other & smile that night, knowing we made the right decision to get married at this paradise on earth with this heaven-sent team. 
Zelda/front desk, Aulani/ concierge, & Naomi/ belldesk were the example of gracious hosts - making sure every need during the busiest week of our lives were met & exceeded. 
We are grateful & indebted to Marissa & the rest of the Mauna Lani team for giving us the most romantic & care-free wedding.","Date of stay: February 2020","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The refurbishment is to a very high standard. Staff were amazing. Rooms well laid out and ""new"". 

Now lets talk catering. The first night at the Canoe House it took 3 hours to get the main course. When it arrived the fancy lettuce turned out to be ""grease proof paper"" in sauce, nice ! The next day lunch took over 3 hours from ordering and then nothing arrived. We were not a special case, the kitchen was broken which is not a reflection on the staff who were amazing, it wasn't their fault. 

There are some great eateries just outside the complex which you can get a  courtesy car to.

PLOT TWIST: The ocean view was another building. And I guess literally the ocean is behind it, but what a let down. I stayed in 3 other lodgings during our stay on the big island with ocean views- and none were obstructed.

Rooms have modern looking fixtures, but walls and doors are still thin, the hotel hallway and guest floors are thin 80s carpeting. I could hear our neighbor's phone alarm, for example. I'd love to see a guidebook (not just a map) in the room, and lanai furniture closer to the nice stuff at the common spaces that everyone can see.

Upon arrival, we were denied a late check out since the hotel was booked the following night.

I didn't bring any of this up to staff onsite, and I probably should have.

What gives this review 2 stars instead of 1 is the staff: from top to bottom, dining, cleaning, or by the beach, the daily staff was all very kind and attentive. Additionally, the facility was clean and if someone else had picked up the tab on my room, I probably wouldn't have minded the other stuff. It seems to have a good amount of activities for families and kids, and the staff working them is friendly and helpful.

........
I suggest: Save your money, or spend it more wisely: I recommend staying at a nearby less expensive spot. The gorgeous coastline is great at all resorts and nearby spots. Head over to Mauna Lani for a meal, or a market iced coffee and a pastry. Then, stay and enjoy the pool or the sunset!

Since we had opted for a “Mountain View” room, instead of upgrading to an ocean view or suite (and the ocean views are technically “partial ocean views”), our room was a bit underwhelming: fairly small, spare, and with a view of the parking lot and Porte-cochere. We did not see other rooms, but perhaps should have splurged on the upgrade. Every employee we interacted with was lovely...though often a bit stressed, as I believe the hotel was understaffed for the groups they had in-house. We waited 45 minutes poolside for a small bowl of (about 15) potato chips one afternoon, as the kitchen was so backed up. Because of the groups in-house, it was difficult to find choice poolside lounges. Dinner at the Canoe House was nice (can’t beat the setting); the Sunday brunch was excellent. Since the resort has just recently reopened, I’m hopeful that some of the issues will be sorted out in the near future.","Date of stay: February 2020","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

We were there in mid February.  The title of my review basically sums up the experience.  If you come here thinking you're getting ""brand new everything,"" you might be disappointed.  Many shops aren't open yet and the rooms (ours at least) looked incomplete.  But what has been completed is quite beautiful.

PROS:

*The lobby and other common areas are beautiful.  The indoor fish ponds are gone, but the added space is now used for more seating areas.  Furnishings are tasteful and make use of a lot of wood and Hawaiian decor.  The vegetation hasn't fully grown in yet, but once it does, it will be even more stunning.  

*Staff.  Still the strength of this place.  They were great before the upgrade and nothing has changed.  Helpful, friendly, what more could you ask for.  I will say one thing though.  They are still learning all of the ins/outs of the new place and systems.  Expected though with things being so new.

*Room.  The new furniture and bathroom are very nice.  Definitely a new feel to the rooms and very clean.  The lanai now has a small outdoor couch and ottoman (which replaced the lounger) and has a new table and chairs as well.  We had a deluxe ocean view, and found the room to be nice and spacious.  Views great as always.

CONS:  Unfortunately, more than I would have liked.....

*No more self parking.  It's all valet now.  So be prepared to add 15.00 daily to the 35.00 daily resort fee and whatever tips you feel obligated to give the valets.  The valets though were excellent.  

*Room lighting system....wow.....It took quite a while to really learn this system.  The lights are all on dimmers, but what was confusing was that certain ""master"" switches control ALL the lights.  So if you use it to control things in the living area, the person in the bathroom is going to get the same effects since it will override the bathroom lighting controls.  More than once, we were calling out, ""hey, you turned off my lights"" while in the shower or...ahem...otherwise indisposed.  By the way, the toilet is in a separate room and lighting, even if turned up to full, still left it very dark.  Mood lighting for potty time?

*There was a nice hole under the mini bar area where the mini fridge will eventually go.  My wife used it as a shelf for storing stuff.  Credit to the staff though as they did have a fridge in the corner of the room.  Looked out of place, but better than not having one. 

*The AC didn't quite work.  Though quiet, the temperature was always colder than what you set it for.  So for example, if you wanted the room to be 75, you would need to set the thermostat at 80 or so.

*Lanai.  As mentioned early, there are new furnishings on the lanai which were great!  However the lanai itself hasn't been touched.  The tile floor and wood railing are still the old ones and now look even more dated with the new decor elsewhere.  There were dabs of paint here and there which looked sloppy. 
 
*Screen doors to Lanai.  There weren't any!!!  All that's left is the rusted, black grout peeling rails where the screen doors used to sit on (messy and unsightly in it's own right).  Now, if you want a nice breeze blowing through your room or enjoy the sounds of the ocean, you'll have to chance having other critters join you in your room.  As I looked around the property, none of the other rooms had screens either, but I did see some workers on a lanai, so hopefully, they will return to finish upgrading the lanais.

I make these comments as a critique for you and the management staff to consider, not as a dismissal of the property.  As I mentioned previously, come here with the right mindset, and you'll have a great time.  We will be returning as nothing was bad enough to truly disappoint us, but hopefully, many of these shortcomings will be rectified by our next visit.","Date of stay: February 2020","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Experienced traveler to both Auberge Resorts (de Soleil, Esperanza, Cordillera) and the big Island of Hawaii (Mauna Kea, Four Seasons) so I was exited when Auberge took over management and renovations of Mauna Lani. Looked forward to beginning my vacation at this remodeled resort.

 My experience, however, has been the less than what I expected. 

Upon check in we were greeted by the bell staff and directed to check in. Luggage would follow promptly. Check in was courteous although a little frazzled. Normally you would expect the bellman or hotel staff to follow you to your room to demonstrate location, how the electronics work, lightening, ice etc. We were shown where the elevator was. We found our room and where able to discover some of these issues ourselves. After 30 min our luggage still had not arrived and a call was necessary to deliver which happened 15 min later (btw our room was two minutes from the front desk)

Upon arrival to our room we began noticing significant problems with the room. In size it was much smaller than advertised. There was no place to put luggage it was so small. The only chair in the room was in front of the closet and so to access the closet space you had to move the chair. The phone did not work. In the corner near the bed was a plugged in mini refrigerator. Bathroom had no counter space and a step over shower which was an accident waiting to happen. Towels had no racks and were placed on side of tub which got wet when showering. Inquires that night about the room were met with shrugs and information that all rooms were the same. Following day we visited friends room traveling with us and noted a definite difference in size and layout. Two more visits to front desk eventually resulted to transfer to the room we thought was on the website. It was significant and dramatic difference that required a lot of complaining to effect. The new room was quite nice and without further issues.

We had a reservation set up with the CanoeHouse which was lost and then snobbily not handled by the hostess or concierge. Required intervention by the GM ( thanks) to straighten out.

The good news is the renovation has made the common areas quite dramatic and impressive.

Food was generally good although service a bit disjointed at times. Buffet for breakfast comparable with other resorts. Pool service, chairs and view were quite good. 

Not really a swim beach if that’s your thing.

Golf was easy and not crowded with good facilities managed by Troon golf.

Workout facilities were excellent 

My overall impression was negative given the discussion above but I feel it most likely a function of growing pains and will improve with time given the sincerity of the staff and GM’s assistance at rectifying the problems. Give it some time and follow the reviews.","Date of stay: February 2020","Trip type: Traveled with friends","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

Service is inconsistent, some of the room design elements are very strange, and the service is not up to par for a hotel of this price. 

We arrived, after a long journey, around 4pm (check in is at 3pm), but our room wasn’t ready for another hour. The lobby was a mess of people, all waiting for their rooms. The frantic front desk staff said we could walk around and they’d call when the room was ready. No map or orientation, and no welcome drink or even water offered (although we could see both behind the front desk).  Even when our room was ready, we had to specifically ask for a property map, event schedule, etc.

Service did not pick up the next day. Poolside service was MIA — we took towels to get set up, and no one came around offering water for over an hour. We got drinks at the bar since no one came around to take orders til lunch, and when we ordered, they forgot an entree, which took half an hour to correct. 

The room has a series of baffling design choices. First, the thermostat doesn’t work so the room was 64 degrees when we set it for 75 — we woke up freezing!  Although we called to the front desk and they promised an engineer would come fix it, we had no follow up. We haven’t used the thermostat since. The light switch in the bathroom also turns on the lights in the foyer, so you wake everyone up if you have to use the toilet at night. And the light switches turn off all the lights in the room, so you can’t just turn off the lights in the bathroom.  And the TV did not appear to get any channels, and could only be used by ChromeCasting from a phone/tablet. 

The food at the restaurants have been generally good, although prices extremely high, and hidden fees everywhere you look.  For example, room service tacked on a $10 service charge, $6 delivery charge, and a separate gratuity.  By the way, valet is $45/night.

Also, be sure to book dinner and spa reservations well in advance, or you will find yourself disappointed.

Despise these many hiccups, the property is gorgeous, the staff generally looking to please, and we very much appreciated the  body pillow for my wife, as our travel agent had told the hotel it was our babymoon. Still, way too many little problems for the price we paid!","Date of stay: February 2020","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

Most disappointing was the service at the restaurants....untrainied wait staff, hour long wait for one cocktail and another hour before food arrived.  And the pricing? Ridiculous. The food? Unremarkable. The fish sandwich appeared to be on a bun straight from a plastic grocery store package -- remember Wonder Bread? Now you get the idea. At the iconic CanoeHouse restaurant -- an all-time favorite of ours over the years -- the staff could not have been less welcoming when we stopped iin to have a look around with a fellow event planner who is always looking for venues to host sophisicated groups.

It is truly a luxury property and I can’t recommend it highly enough. The staff is outstanding - we got hugs from favorite wait staff when we left!  The best experience was a sunrise paddle in the outrigger with Hawaiians chanting, whales all around us, and the sun peaking over Mauna Kea. Magical. (Reserve the sunrise paddle way in advance, it is popular). Just be aware that the hotel just reopened. So it still has a few kinks to work out. The billing system for example. 🙄 And although the hotel doesn’t seem busy, it was hard to get reservations at the Canoe House and Napua. Both are fabulous. Make those in advance. Wasn’t as wild about Halani. Don’t quite get the Mediterranean slant. Would have rather had something like Hawaiian fish house. But those are minor quibbles.

The resort is beautiful and the renovation is obviously high quality. A few issues have come up in the first 24 hours here. We booked an ocean view deluxe room and our room did have a distant ocean view but a majority of the view was of the industrial appearing conference center roof below and in front of the room. We were able to switch to a new room of the same category which has a much nicer view. However, the room is extremely noisy. It appears that the hallway flooring was never updated and is currently square tiles. Our room is across from a storage/equipment closet and there is constant loud rumbling noise from the staff moving carts across the old tile in the hallways and into the closet across from our room. We just had our fire alarm go off which was obviously very loud and disturbing. Security cane to the room and informed me this is a common occurrence due to moisture and humidity in the room causing a malfunction of the smoke detector sensor. We hope that the rest of our stay is improved.

***Update
The hotel manager reached out to us and moved us to a larger and quieter room. Additionally, he gave us hotel credit to use at the resort restaurants/facilities. He was very professional and responded quickly to various issues that came up during the rest of the stay including broken toilet, bath that did not drain, and poolside lunch service that took over 1.5 hours to receive our food. While this new Auberge is not perfect, I believe that over time the issues will be worked out.

It had only been open three weeks when I was there for three nights.  I stayed at the Marriott two days prior and their staffs' level of service far exceeded the Mauna Lani. The rooms were nice but the bed was one of the hardest most uncomfortable beds I've ever had in a higher level hotel. It needs a feather/down mattress overlay.  I ordered a  small pizza one night from room service and it was simply delivered in a pizza box in a bag...no iced water, no table, salt or pepper, or floral vase...just a box, fork and napkin...for $33. The room had no table or desk, just a single chair. The restaurant's menu lacks diversity and is very expensive - hard for two people to stay under $70 for breakfast.  The poolside drinks were also expensive (and small).   The spa is new as well.....who thought of putting clear glass doors in the women's showers????  Alot of negatives, I realize.  Being newly renovated, it was extremely clean.  The food/cocktail serves on the beach were very nice!

With the extensive, modern design updates and amenities, it felt quite unlike most Hawaiian resorts I know... maybe a touch more Miami than Big Island? Full disclosure: I never stayed at Mauna Lani pre-renovation; I heard more than once that it was a well-loved classic, but can imagine that time had taken its toll on the resort and that an overhaul was in order. 

The new public spaces are beautiful, featuring soft fabrics, modern furniture, lots of light wood and excellent lighting, and when the extensive new tropical plantings have some time to grow in, the landscape will surely do much to soften what is basically a 1970s brutalist building. Our room on the top, sixth, floor, was also nicely decorated with light, modern touches and a killer ocean view from the private lanai (it seems that most rooms have good views). The bathroom was a bit small, lacked a tub, and had no storage space. Not a huge issue but it sounds from some other reviews that perhaps other rooms have more generous bathroom space? The sixth floor open air hallways could use some more softening and lighting though, maybe some tropical plants are yet to be installed in the designers’ master plans?

We certainly didn’t spend much time indoors, given the fantastic pools, bar, and grounds to explore. Only disappointment was that the surf shack was not yet open and remained wrapped in ugly red construction fencing... a building inspector holdup, we were informed. Because of the recent opening, there was still some construction work being done on property. It wasn’t too distracting or noisy, and the hotel kindly offered  a resort credit for every night booked (which helped lessen the blow from high food and beverage costs, though the final bill at checkout time was confusing to say the least.). 

Speaking of food, the selection at the main Halani restaurant was great for breakfast, tasty for lunch (same exact menu also featured at the pools and bar), and sometimes perplexing at dinner time.  Some more island seafood dishes would be a good addition if the menu gets tweaked in the future. The other on-resort dining option was Canoe House, where advanced reservations seemed essential even for hotel guests. There, the setting was even nicer with full ocean and sunset views, but the menu again skewed too far to one direction, in this case Japanese. It was billed as the more fine-dining option, but honestly didn’t seem any more expensive than Halani. If staying at Mauna Lani for more than a few nights you will definitely want to explore other off-resort dining options, most of which require a rental car or Uber ride to nearby resorts or towns. 

We loved the Market store that opened at the crack of dawn and made killer lattes! Stays open late too, for sundowner provisions. Yes, bottles of wine will set you back $80 or more, but that’s the cost of convenience. The larger, general supermarket is a short walk or bike ride away if you need it. 

The service at the resort was always top notch and Island-friendly. It seems that many servers at the restaurants had been with Mauna Lani since before the management change, which was nice to see. Checkin and concierge, while also friendly, could be a bit more polished and efficient. Beach guys and their sports and resort offerings were great... try a morning beach workout with Nai if you can!

Lastly, kudos to management for really emphasizing sustainability throughout the resort. From the refillable Malin + Goetz product bottles in the bathrooms, to fully compostable coffee cups at the Market, to paper straws in the Mai Tais and refillable water coolers poolside...it made me feel good to see all of these environmentally sensitive details implemented in such a naturally beautiful environment, without any compromise to the level of service. 

I would definitely come back to stay again, once the resort has had had a bit of time to work out kinks and the palm trees in the courtyard loose their training wheel scaffolding! It’s a great rebirth for an iconic Big Island resort destination.","Date of stay: January 2020","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

I stayed for a week. Front desk made no eye contact w/ me while I waited for help (no other guest with me checking in). I was early, 2:30pm for check in, they assured me they would call when my room was ready, supposedly at 3pm. I called someone 4:30, & spoke to 3 people. They finally got me to my room, however no luggage til an hour later & 2 phone calls  to anyone that could help. Sad. There was still ALOT of unfinished construction. Bulldozer near the pool, cutting a wall on our floor (noisy), all plants near grand staircase were brown from dying, and the beach shack has orange tape around it. Also, upon checking out, I was waiting for a simple “How was your stay ?” Nothing. Absolutely quiet. Last gripe I have: WiFi was sketchy the whole week I was there. 

Pros: The valet always used my name, and were helpful at all times. The turn down servIce was consistent, and my housekeeper had a bucket of ice for me daily. The grounds, what was finished is relaxing.

When the Auberge folks took it over, I wanted to get back and see what they had done to the hotel and grounds. Well, they have done a lot. The rooms have been updated and are more modern. Other than the lack of a bathroom drawer, it was all positive. 
The grounds are quite different. Most of the ponds are gone. The water features in the atrium, outside Bay Terrace (now Halani) and by Canoe House have been removed. I did miss the old spotlight on the ocean by Canoe House. That view of the surf after dark was always beautiful. The atrium stairway has been redone and is beautiful. Thankfully, there is still a hula dancer and a musician who start in the atrium and then move out onto the lawn by the Ha Bar. Ha Bar is brand new. It is located where the pond was, just off the atrium near the pool. Ha Bar, which is also beautiful, does serve some food items. It is a great spot to hang out. 
Our first day at Mauna Lani was, due to the changes, something of a shock. Second day I noticed all of the extra seating around the property, grabbed coffee and a muffin in the new coffee shop, and came to appreciate that Mauna Lani continues to exist with beauty and grace. This was, in no small part, due to having connected with so many old friends on the staff.

Staff generally seems well trained, but there are a few things that the staff isn’t trained in or doesn’t seem to know that should improve as time passes. 

With the huge and pleasing decor a change the hotel inexplicably didn’t change were the very heavy old sliding glass doors to the balcony. They stick badly and would be difficult to open for slight people or those with back problems. 

The beach and pool staff is terrific and promptly provides chair covers and towels.  The grounds landscaping is very pleasing. 

The price of food and beverages is much higher than in prior visits. So much so that we ate very few meals at the hotel.

Much has changed, very little is the untouched. Sea turtles are gone from the property (but I found one in the ocean while snorkeling). The conference area still has the old wooden paneling and shutters, it appears to be the only area they haven't done much renovation yet.
We checked in Jan 15th 2020, the first day of ""hard"" opening (as opposed to soft opening that appeared to start several weeks earlier). Valet was a mess at check in. Later in our 7-day stay, valet got better each day, and was fine by the time we left.
The renovation is excellent for the rooms. Interior of rooms is like a brand new place. The lighting technology is fantastic, so easy to get the right mood lighting for any time of day. The shower is good, bathroom had double vanity. The Nespresso-style coffee maker works well and they provide 6 complimentary pods per day, as well as 4 complimentary bottled waters per day...or I should say, per service, because a turn down is also provided in the evening, and if coffee or water is used I think it would be replaced.
So, my THOUGHTS - the resort is a let down if you expect an Auberge level of service. It does not rival Four Seasons, for example. Check in was rather standard at a front desk area. Nobody escorted us to room. Food quality was extremely good and that was a highlight. The breakfast buffet at $48/person is high but quality is great, selection is great of both sweet and savory, and includes juices, coffee, and order of a hot menu item (or multiples if you ask). Buffet does not have hot items, so they can be served fresh every time. Buffet is classy, far beyond a typical Marriott for example.

Pools are very nice, large, well equipped, but I would request management to reassess the umbrella and lounge orientation vs. the sun - there's no way to have good shade coverage from the umbrellas provided. The umbrellas don't tilt or move, and the lounges can only move so far, meaning that most of the time you are partly or mostly in the sun even if you have an umbrella. On the plus side, we found plenty of space at the pool and no shortage of lounges or umbrellas, as well as zero ""saved with a book"" type of early-morning lounge ""pre-reserving"" going on. Pool is well staffed and they expect to set up your lounge cover, and they bring a cooler of ice water for your personal use. Food/Bev at pool is well done also. Lounges are brand new and very nicely padded, this is high quality/expensive outdoor furniture. The beach is not good, too rocky, not great snorkeling areas (although it's better out past the first range of rocks around to the right of the first red buoy). We preferred pool to beach for this reason. (It's the reverse of Mauna Kea, where the beach is much better than the pool.) The adults-only pool was too quiet for our tastes, we preferred the main resort pool which had more activity, but we found the kids present to be well behaved and not unruly.

Room was not ready at earlyish 1pm arrival, but they did call me proactively 10 minutes ahead of check in time to say it was. Rooms are a highlight. You can't find much to fault in the rooms frankly, but I will give two comments for management - I never heard noise from neighbors except two things, the coffee makers (they are NOISY), and the slamming of the front doors due to overly tight door-closing mechanisms. Suggest to change coffee makers to something quieter, and reset the door closers so they don't slam so hard.

Canoe House is a sore spot because on second day of our stay I visited the concierge to get a reservation. She informed me it is sold out for the next month or so, impossible to get in there, and mostly locals booked it because they're excited it is reopening. No spots reserved for guests? No notices emailed to me to say ""hey you are coming and we wanted to let you know to book ahead for Canoe House""?? -- well I would have appreciated a heads up so I could book it, or some special places held for guests vs. others. I wanted to revisit it since we dined there in 1996. So that's a painful miss, Auberge.
OVERALL - if I had a crystal ball, I think the property will not stay with Auberge more than two years. It is overpriced right now for what you get ($550-600 starting range would be more suitable than $850-900). It is much larger than a typical Auberge, and they haven't figured out how to make that work for their unique brand style. There's something missing - that lagniappe, or ""something extra special,"" feels like it is missing. I think the physical renovation has gone as far as possible, but the resort still lacks a feeling of cohesion and class. It's like the place hasn't figured out what it wants to be, all the parts don't quite fit together...and as you can guess, it leaves you feeling ""no, I'm not sure I want to pay $900 for this privilege.""  For me, the Mauna Kea is superior in terms of feeling of cohesion and classiness, at this same price point. At slightly higher price, I would think the Four Seasons Hualalai is still quite superior to Mauna Lani in almost every way. But to be clear: I would go back for $550 with expectation of a fine time and things being fine but unexceptional - definitely yes!  It might be my new ""go to"" vacation spot but I will have reasonable expectations, and I will look for some value pricing or special offers so I can feel that the cost lines up with what you get. Bottom line, Mauna Lani is really serviceable and nothing of a hard nature is wrong with it, but at a haughty price point we expect nearer to perfection, including a sense of cohesion.

Note - ask them about the cave and go see it. Interesting historical feature, and the light hole in middle is really fascinating.","Date of stay: January 2020","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Gorgeous property. Would love to give it 5 stars but there were constant issues. The A.C was not running when we arrived. It took 2 hours for the room to cool off. When it finally started running there was no adjustment to the temperature. We had to freeze or sweat. We called the engineering again and were met with a very gruff person. We had no choice but to keep it running in the 60's. Next..no hot water for the beautiful tub. After 3 days they finally found a tech that knew how to adjust the temperature. In fact, I told the guys, 3 days earlier that there had to be a temperature adjustment and they ignored me. I hate to be so negative but I give honest reviews. The property is beautiful and the grounds are meticulous. The front desk staff is very friendly, but do not count on the Concierge to give you recommendations. They just don't know. We asked for a place to have steak, other than Ruth's Chris. They had no clue. Not forthcoming about other recommendations. The small restaurant is extremely expensive and the staff underwhelming. ($28 hamburger!) While we encountered many issues, they made a significant price adjustment to our bill but this was a vacation that was full of flaws and we would have much preferred to pay full price and have it be relaxing without constant issues. I believe they might have pushed the opening.  I feel that the four stars I gave them was pretty generous, considering the issues that we had but , but I have high hopes that this property deserves another chance and will offer a top notch vacation experience.","Date of stay: January 2020","Trip type: Traveled on business","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

I live on the Big Island and have stayed at all the luxury beach properties Kona side, as well as luxury (and not so luxury) properties around the world.  We came to stay at the Mauna Lani for four nights as part of my wife's birthday and were quite curious to see how it had changed.  

Because we are local, I'll not gush about how wonderful it is to be on a Hawaiian beach in winter (yes, it is) or the glory of seeing whales (yes, that is glorious), or that there are lots of luxury resort types of things to do.  Nor will I whine as some reviewers about such trivial issues as 'the pool is too quiet'.  But I hope I might offer to the management that may read this some observations for their interest.  And no, I will not quibble to the point I heard one snooty and entitled guest from the mainland demanding at the little Market, gluten free croissants, a ten ingredient coffee drink, and assurances the pastry wasn't too 'sticky'.  Sigh. (by the way management, goats are a nuisance or even hazard on the Island and it wasn't all that smart to make them a mascot for the Market of sorts.  Yes, we overheard your conversation.)

Public Service Announcement - please please please leave your Bluetooth enabled speakers at home as your new 'friends' at the resort may not have the same level of appreciation for your brilliant playlist and sharing of these songs in public spaces as you might expect after you've had a few adult beverages.  The staff is not sure how to address such gross boorishness.  They are kinda shocked.  Oh, and also, your public dancing after these beverages is not really something I ever hope to see again.  End of PSA.

The renovation is very nice with lots of great meeting spaces scattered about.  We did think the inclusion of African art to be odd - yes designers, we know that mud cloth and baskets from Ghana kinda look Polynesian, but please, they aren't.  Just no. 

Room was nicely done although light switches a bit over complicated.  Huge pillows which had some comfort issues but admit we didn't ask housekeeping for smaller ones.  And mattress quite firm.  We had a full oceanfront room and enjoyed the lanai very much - sunset dead on.  Internet was solid, TV had some odd glitches the one occasion we used it.  Oh, and please, get the check out from your room fixed as the line checking out the last day was pretty unfortunate (hint - if you can't check out on the TV get to the desk before you need to depart, we had a long line).  Also, please integrate the 'resort credit' into the bill instead of having to get somebody to do a hard copy and write by hand the deductions.  I'm still not sure they did it properly as the bill was a hot mess.

Loved the quiet adult pool.  Staff was great as well with a wonderful paddle and snorkel out.  Top notch beach staff, top notch!  Mahalo guys!  We were VERY pleasantly surprised by the food quality at the bar and restaurant adjacent.  In fact, for wife's bday dinner we elected to get oysters at Canoe House then dinner at the hotel poolside restaurant and glad we did.  Hey Canoe House, yes, I'm talking to you .. I know you were very excited the hotel owner and head architect were sitting next to us at the bar, and we kinda stopped existing, but forgetting my order while remembering hers, then steadfastly ignoring us, then not even apologizing when thirty minutes after she'd finished hers you realized mine was missing as we departed ....  Sheesh.  I dunno, and not to be ridiculous but I felt a bit blown off by the owner as he asked us where we were from as we sat at the bar, and when we said Hilo his eyes glazed over and we seemed to become non persons to him and the staff.  Oysters were quite good though (although prepared differently from the night before but no change on the menu), wine presentation was nice for a by the glass wine, but just ignoring us and neglecting an order was kinda second class for what is supposed to be a fantastic restaurant ... and the chocolate texture dessert with some kinda weird puree that tasted like something from a jar of baby food ... please fix that dessert, please.  Begging you. Heck, just serve ice cream.  Anything.  Chocolate texture must die!!!

So while Canoe House seemed to be resting on its laurels and to be truthful even was pre-renovation, our favorite meals there were at the Captain's Table (chef's table) the food and staff at the bar and poolside restaurant and cafe were ... top notch.  Better wine by the glass list, food that came from somebody who cared (yes, not to be over critical but I did send back some scallops that had ice centers, which they fixed and comped us .. that is how you do business Canoe House, make a mistake and own up to it!).  And one of the best desserts I've ever had in my life, the s'more dessert, was a chocolate lovers dream.  So yeah, Canoe House has a foo foo reputation, gets sold out, but they lack a fire the younger staff and cooks had at the HaLani restaurant.  They cared.  Food had some love.  Well done guys and gals!

Another tip ... there is a Foodland small grocery store at the mall a mile up the road.  You can Uber there.  It doesn't look like much but they have a nice gourmet section and you can get some very very good upscale wines and foods there.  The Market store they have on resort sells a bottle of champagne I can get locally for 35 dollars for 80 dollars.  They sell a 4 ounce plastic bowl of granola for 18 dollars (which is weird as a bag with three times that amount is sold in the same store for 10 dollars).  I'm not wanting to nickle and dime things but ... just seems like some pricing issues to be worked out.  The coffee was very reasonable in price.  Call me confused.

Would we stay again?  A qualified yes.  If I felt as locals we were welcomed (which I did by the local staff but didn't get that vibe otherwise), if I didn't need to be by the best beaches (which are at the Hapuna and Mauna Kea), and if I was ok with a three seasons experience (not at the Four Seasons level for luxury but not quite as expensive either) then sure.   I'd definitely hang out at the adult pool, eat at the HaLani and beach bar/cafe, and spend more time going out on some water based excursions.  Canoe House, you have lost passion, you take too much for granted, and you are being upstaged.  Sure, plenty of tourists who don't know better may not care but you should!!!

So that's it.  Bottom line - most lux (and pricey) experience on Kona side besides Four Seasons.  I think a better beach than Four Seasons, a bit less pricey, guests a tad snooty sometimes, but a nice option.  Staff says they are being well treated and shows in their attitudes and work ethic.  Enough said.","Date of stay: January 2020","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Fast forward and I'm married with two kids in their 20's with 3 of us on the east coast and the eldest working in San Francisco--when I heard about the renovation, we made plans for a week just after their re-opening.

IT WAS AMAZING!  Beautiful (and stylish) renovation of everything...beautiful landscaping and some great golf on-site and nearby. The rooms are beautifully done with sliding doors, great bathrooms and very large terraces. The gym had just opened and was great; two of us are serious tennis players and loved the pros there.

We were at one of the restaurant's 1st or 2nd nights open yet went back 2-3 more times--great and healthful Mediterranean food (and a terrific, if not inexpensive,  breakfast).

The service (i.e., front desk, car people, restaurant and pool employees) was amazing and I would expect that it only gets better as they get more used to the routines. There are excellent activities, too, especially the beachfront yoga and the ""Hawaii 5-0"" giant canoes (sounds silly but a lot of fun).

Fast forward and I'm married with two kids in their 20's with 3 of us on the east coast and the eldest working in San Francisco--when I heard about the renovation, we made plans for a week just after their re-opening.

IT WAS AMAZING!  Beautiful (and stylish) renovation of everything...beautiful landscaping and some great golf on-site and nearby. The rooms are beautifully done with sliding doors, great bathrooms and very large terraces. The gym had just opened and was great; two of us are serious tennis players and loved the pros there.

We were at one of the restaurant's 1st or 2nd nights open yet went back 2-3 more times--great and healthful Mediterranean food (and a terrific, if not inexpensive,  breakfast).

The service (i.e., front desk, car people, restaurant and pool employees) was amazing and I would expect that it only gets better as they get more used to the routines. There are excellent activities, too, especially the beachfront yoga and the ""Hawaii 5-0"" giant canoes (sounds silly but a lot of fun). 

We will be back a lot sooner than 30 years!  Amazing spot.","Date of stay: January 2020","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"
