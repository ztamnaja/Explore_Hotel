863459438,20,Avoid this property,"I first came here in 1983 and it was a quality hotel, but a much smaller operation that it has now become. It is too big and impersonal and the main focus seems to be to fleece the customer in any way possible.  For example, a club soda around the pool is $12 plus all the taxes. A fill up is another $12 etc etc. A cabana by the pool is $400 for the afternoon, which is just silly.  The hotel advertises that the 2 Kapalua golf courses are part of the operation, which they are not. We tried to book tee times, over the 5 days we are here, but there was nothing available. I went to the Plantation Course myself to see if I could sort something out. They were rude, unhelpful and made it clear they were nothing to do with the hotel.  There are 2 restaurants with very limited menus, which is not commensurate with a supposed 5-star hotel. It appears that this is not really a hotel, but a collection of units which they probably sell to interested parties.  The accommodation is very nice though, as a positive. I assume the property compares itself to 4-Seasons, but be assured it is not even in the same category.  Avoid the place at all cost!",Oct 6,October 2022,Traveled as a couple,,"London, United Kingdom"
855639477,50,Another perfect stay at the Montage,"The Montage is the only place I've stayed at where you can be on vacation and feel at home at the same time. GM Matt Bailey and his crew are exceptional. I could rave about the service, the pool, the rooms, the location and Kapalua itself. But this time I realized that the lobby was built with Hawaiian architecture in mind, open air to allow the Kona winds to cool the property. And on the grounds there are plumeria and hibiscus everywhere. The chocolates and bed candies are from local vendors and there was even an endangered seabird nesting one property. Thank you once again to the Montage for being friendly to the tourist and the local resident, mahalo to you all.",Aug 2022,August 2022,Traveled as a couple,,"Paia, Hawaii"
861242988,50,The Best Resort in Maui,"Our stay was absolutely amazing and am very grateful that we were able to experience it for 5 nights.    Every individual working there had impeccable service and were a delight. Each employee that we interacted with was outstanding. All deserve recognition, but to specifically name a few…    • Brazlee of Cane & Canoe: She was so kind in welcoming us on our first day and making a point to say hello as we had drinks at The Hideaway our first night. She assured us to let her know if we need anything and offered fantastic recommendations from Cane & Canoe. She continued to be so gracious with each interaction and a smiling face throughout our stay.  • Matt of Cane & Canoe: His breakfast service was spot on with timing and anticipated our every need. He also shared amazing tips and recommendations of things to do off-property.  • Bo of Spa Montage: Bo provided a flawless spa treatment and was very kind in his communication and service. He and my boyfriend’s spa provider created a very peaceful environment for us to relax in.  • Zane, Jeremy and Rob of The Hideaway: All three of these individuals were a reason why we made an effort to visit The Hideaway each night. Their service and drinks were perfect. They each shared extremely helpful information of the island regarding activities and excursions. An extra shoutout to Zane – My sister is pregnant and wanted something to sip on while me and the rest of our group had cocktails. She was happy to drink a soda or a simple mocktail, but Zane went above and beyond and made her a custom, delicious frozen mocktail to include her on the fun! She still raves about it.    I look forward to our return to Montage Kapalua Bay.",Sep 2022,September 2022,,,
859983928,50,Another Amazing Family Stay,"My family just returned from our (almost) annual summer trip to Maui! With this being our 4th stay at the Montage I feel more confident in reviewing our experience. First, it seems like the property management has adjusted nicely to the new travel industry reality - more crowds, covid challenges, staffing shortages, etc. From the valet to the pool crew, the staff ran a tight ship.    Observations:  - Valet and bell service crew are the stars of this property. They remembered us from our past visits and alway greeted us with warm welcomes.  - The room was very well maintained and clean. The kitchen was well equipped though it did have an excessive amount of baking supplies for some reason.  - If you like working out during vacations, their gym is one of the best I’ve seen. Spacious with clean equipment and up to date machines  - Lots of well maintained plants and foliage surrounding the pools and buildings  - The beach crew are a very friendly and knowledgeable bunch. Super positive and personable.  - Pools also very clean. The staff was friendly and really strived to deliver the best service. I would say they were slightly understaffed but not compared to other hotels.  - The grass near the beach path is a great spot for kids to run around and play!  - The cultural ambassador (Sila) really impressed my kids with her ukulele and historical lesson.  - The kids club isn’t cheap but well worth it. They took the children on all sorts of adventures and they worked on interesting art projects. The club also offered evening activities which we didn’t sign up for.  - New filtered water stations are a nice touch. We were happy not to go through a ton of bottle waters.    Other notes:  - They had a different musician by the Hana Hou pool bar everyday at 5pm but they stop serving food at 4pm. By 4:30, there are only a handful of people down by the pool. Maybe if they stay open longer they can get more guests to hang out for sunset drinks and bites.  - Turn down service would show up at 8pm sometimes. For our family that is way too late. Our kids are asleep at 7:30!    All in all we had an amazing time. Can’t wait to be back!",Sep 2022,August 2022,Traveled with family,"With kids out of school, summer can be busy.

859300547,50,Magical stay for a family reunion,"We stayed for a week at the Montage Kapalua for a family reunion across three generations, and it was magical. Our group included two young kids (ages 2 and 5) and six adults including grandparents. My family has been coming to Kapalua since I was a kid, and we love the location being a little more remote but still a short drive to Lahaina and other spots. The Montage property itself is gorgeous. The rooms are spacious and well laid out, and we loved the large terraces. Highly recommend getting ocean views as it's just magnificent to look out onto the Pacific Ocean every day. With little kids, we spent part of every day at the pool (where you can also look at the ocean!), which felt almost never crowded. On the one day that it was hard to find a spot by the pool, the attendants went above and beyond to create a nice place for us poolside. The kids absolutely loved the pool, and my 5-year old taught herself to swim on the shallow steps. The pool is well laid out for quieter swimming and lounging at the upper and middle pools and kids on the lower level with shallower depths and waterfalls. Pool service was very friendly and helpful. The kids also loved the beach and the attendants there were helpful as well. We had the best dinner of our entire trip at Cane & Canoe and a delicious breakfast there too -- highly recommend. My kids still nap, and housekeeping was very accommodating to our schedule -- if this applies to you, I recommend calling when you are leaving the room to ensure they visit before nap time. The concierge was also very responsive throughout our trip. The resort manager Nick Kuhns helped rectify any issues that came up and went the extra mile to ensure we had what we needed for our stay. Thank you, Nick and team.",Sep 2022,August 2022,,,
854367055,40,"Lovely resort, but I expected more consistency at this price point","First off, the property is beautiful and well-laid-out. They were a little late in preparing our room, and we arrived a bit before the 4pm check in, so we had to kill a couple of hours before the were able to let us into our room. They upgraded us from a 2 BR to a 3BR suite which I appreciated. Following our first morning in the unit, we found a giant (>3 inch) cockroach dead on the kitchen floor. I forgive this as we never saw any other evidence of pests in the unit during our stay.    The layout of the resort is exceptionally convenient, with everything easily accessible from the unit we were in (5102). Service was inconsistent. Laura at the front desk was exceptionally kind and friendly with my 4 and 7 year old. The pool staff was somewhat standoffish and not very helpful. Though I tipped $20 twice, the pool attendant just threw towels and covers onto our chairs. He didn't even take the time to put them on properly, and he made zero effort to be friendly. I ultimately stopped asking them for help and just did it myself as they made so little effort.  Housekeeping was inconsistent. Sometimes they were exceptionally thorough, others there was visible dirt on the floor and food residue on the table.  There were a few other minor misses that I won't bother to lay out here.  All in all, we had a good experience, but I would not say it felt like a good value for the extraordinarily high price we were paying. We're not very cost-conscious, but I expect more consistency a this price point.",Aug 2022,August 2022,,the 3BR suites are very spacious and convenient.,"San Francisco, California"
854245505,50,Gorgeous resort,"This is an exceptional resort. It is truly one of the most beautiful places I have ever visited and the service is wonderful. We stayed for 8 nights and enjoyed every minute. Before arrival, we arranged several tours with the concierge and found them to be incredibly helpful with trusted tour providers. All the rooms have a huge lanai and a gorgeous view. Housekeeping, servers, valet and bell staff were all amazing. The pool is stunning and has so many different areas, we never felt crowded at all. I think there was only one day were it was difficult to find chairs by the pool. I did feel like the spa service was a bit bumpy and hopefully that will improve. They do offer massages in an outdoor setting and that was very nice. I wouldn’t hesitate to return to the Montage.",Aug 2022,August 2022,Traveled with family,,Laurel MD
849889304,50,July stay,Stayed here 4 nights in July and had a wonderful stay. When you are spending $2500-$3500 a night expectations are high but I felt like they were met and I would return again. Preferred it to the luxury hotels we have stayed at in Wailea.  Pros:  - Excellent secluded location in Kapalua  - welcome leis and private tour on arrival. No delay at check in  - Beautiful spacious rooms with ocean views  - big lanais to sit out on  - Beach service was close by and chairs were complimentary for Montage guests ( can get crowded)  - Pool area had readily available chairs  - Pool service was pretty quick for most part  - valet service and bell service great  - Escalade drop off within Kapalua or Kapalua shuttle readily available  - twice daily housekeeping was very good  -nice spa area    Cons-  - a bit far compared to other luxury resorts  - Food options need more variety( kids menu was exact same at all restaurants)  - Fitness Center doesn't open until 7 am. For those with big time zone changes it is a bit late. When we got there 5 minutes to 7 there was already several people waiting and ready to use.  - Specialty drinks at poolside could be better. Wines were good.,Jul 2022,July 2022,,,
847061779,50,Mahalo to the Staff,"Great location and very relaxing. Been to many luxury Hawaiian Island luxury resorts such as Four Seasons, Grand Wailea, Kea Lani, Mauna Kea, the Orchid, Mani Lani etc etc. and what makes this place magical are the long tenured employees. Kiha, Henry and Jerica at the Hana Hou bar and Ricky, Teehee and Gabe down on Kapalua Bay. Top notch service and most importantly the aloha spirit. We have been coming to this property 6 or so years and we plan to return for many more family vacations. Hopefully the smiling tenured employees will greet us for many years to come.",Jul 2022,July 2022,,,"San Diego, California"
846223536,10,Disappointing,"Hard product: This place feels older and dated. Staying at other places with a similar price point makes me feel disappointed:    Service: The staff that are there are really good, except for the spa attendants. You can tell they are having a hiring issues. No food or drinks at spa pool. It was disappointing.    Food: Everything but the breakfast is really bad. Pool side food is really bad.

The accomodations are top notch - tasteful & understated, well designed, spacious, with great lanais. The grounds are impeccable with no detail overlooked (though trash cans are so well hidden they're hard to find). The service & soft touches is what sets this property apart - proactive, personal, and helpful without being overbearing or too high-touch - the Montage staff gets it just right. The one time we asked for something, it was delivered to the room in minutes.    Breakfast @ cane & canoe was amazing and consistent.. Poke at lunch was delish though could have had 2 portions easily. Best massages of my life at the spa.

Thank you for your passion and sharing with us some history about Hawaii. We learned so much from them both. Ukelele, local vegetation, making our own orchid leis ans learning to Hula. Really... don't miss these enriching activities that are offered. We also enjoyed the clean and high- quality gym eqipment. Feeding the koi fish by the lobby at 8am was alwayz something fun to do.

830143236,20,No treally an ocean view,"The Montage has several categories of room. The most expensive one bedroom is the 1 Bedroom Premier Ocean View Residence. They claim  ""The first thing you see when stepping into this tranquil retreat is the sparkling blue ocean."" They charge 2-4 thousand a night for this. We checked in and it was really a pool view room with the ocean In the distance. There is no tranquility, unless you like to hear amplified music in your bedroom with the windows closed and children screaming at the pool. You can sort of see the ocean, if you look past the lawn, the other buildings, the pool, the bar and the trees.    After complaining, we were moved to another room and told that NONE OF THE ONE BEDROOM ROOMS WERE CLOSE TO THE OCEAN. ALL HAVE A SIMILAR VIEW OF THE OCEAN, BUT THE FIRST THING YOU SEE AND HEAR IS NOT THE OCEAN. the photo shows views from our first room we declined and the second we settled for.    Other than the view, the room is nice.

We hired the private chef Riko for an evening tasting menu and that was one of the highlights. While there, we did have to experience limited menu however, there was enough restaurants int he surroundings to offset the lack of food options. This wasn't the case for dinner. The pools are amazing with a variety of levels. Service was amazing as well. Wether on the pool or the restaurants, service was impeccable. I also enjoyed whale watching right from the pool deck.

Our stunning room offered views of the ocean and one favorite past time was spotting whales from our hotel room. We enjoyed swimming and snorkeling in pristine Kapalua Bay (with turtles) and hiking the nearby trails. We loved the beautiful amenities and most of all the first class service we experienced during our stay. Everyone we encountered from the front desk to the restaurant staff was extremely helpful and went above and beyond to make our stay memorable. The food at Cane and Canoe was delicious.

The Montage is well located on a gorgeous bluff adjacent to Kapalua Bay, and the views and scenery are stunning. The grounds are well manicured, and we really enjoyed the pool and outdoor spaces.    We also really enjoyed lounging, swimming, and snorkeling at Kapalua Bay. The bay sometimes experiences waves/choppiness due to the swell that comes from the North during the winter, but we had a few days of good snorkeling!!    As expected from a Montage, we received exceptional service from everyone we encountered, and breakfast was great every morning.    Highly recommend the Montage in Maui!

820369215,20,Complete disappointment!!,"We have been wanting to stay here for the last few years, due to COVID had to cancel twice. We came with family week of Thanksgiving and stayed in Wailea where we normally stay. Then came here after all the kids left. The valet is so helpful & friendly! The property absolutely beautiful and room so nice especially the large lanai!    All the housekeeping go out of their way to help and were a blessing! Our bed wasn’t de-feathered as my husband has allergy. So we had to call for that. Requested an HDMI cable and waited about 45 mins and finally had to call again to receive it.    Dined at Cane & Canoe, asked for a wine list and after sitting there for 30 mins had to ask again and still had to wait. We had to wait over 30 mins for our server to even come to our table and this was early and not even busy. Told the server ‘Chris’ my husband has garlic allergy and twice brought out food with garlic. I say Chris as we weren’t sure if it was Chris. We were told when we sat down Chris would be our server but he did not introduce himself. He never really came back to our table to check on us and had to track him down to get the food remade. He truly didn’t seem to care at all. The food was mediocre at best and disappointing.    We usually stay at Four Seasons Maui which is a true 5-star hotel all around with impeccable service and food where will be returning in the future. I’m so sad as this hotel has so much potential and is just an absolutely beautiful property with the best rooms & lanais on the island!

818008428,50,Amazing View. Amazing Care. Amazing Everything!,"We stayed in the Molokai wing on the third floor. Every time I walked in and saw the view, I wanted to cry. It was just breathtaking. I wanted to cry more when we had to leave. The lanai is the highlight. It just let me relax completely. Feet up, read, and watch the boats go by. I felt like Otis Redding, sitting on the dock of the bay. The inside was far nicer than our house. I think we need to hire a designer! Each of our kids had their own room, and all but one bedroom had a stunning ocean view. Our son had to settle for the mountain view. Fast internet. Top quality food. The downstairs guests had an actual luau one night.    Then there's the swimming pools, which are gorgeous. The waterfall is like a massage. I worked with my wife, giving swimming lessons. I hear the spa is nice, but I'm not much for that. Food? The onsite restaurant has a fantastic dinner, but there are probably 10 restaurants in either walking distance or a quick drive away, given by the bell desk. They have Cadillacs.    We took so many walks, I actually lost weight while in Maui. There's an old golf course that has overgrown and turned into an amazing hike. The longest walk I did was about 8 miles, and the views from up on the mountain are gorgeous. There's a duck pond where all the locals take their dogs.    Best of all is the ocean. The sunsets over the water are divine. There is also a beach down below that has tons of sea turtles.

815611759,50,“Outstanding Service” Employees,"My husband and I recently traveled to Maui with our daughter’s family, spending a week at the Montage. We have been to Napili and Kapalua many times, but this was our first actual stay there. We took a van from the airport, stayed a week in a condominium there, and did not even rent a car. Except for a trip to the market, we were at the resort the entire week, and had a relaxing “blast”. Of course, the resort is absolutely gorgeous, and the condo was great. But the outstanding feature of our stay was the warmth of the employees. Upon arrival, we were welcomed with enthusiasm, escorted to our condo, and offered a ride for the market. (We had placed a market order to be delivered in a day or so. Nice option!) A sign on the door from “Paint Box” welcomed the children. We ordered room service for appetizers and dinner that night, and the service was impeccable. Jamie even helped us with the tv when she arrived. Poolside service was also great. Beth and other very friendly servers took good care of us. All the employees at the towel bar were very helpful, even locating noodles for little pool chairs we had brought over for the kids. Kody and Taylor were among the great pool staff that helped us make every day enjoyable. The Cultural Ambassadors provided unique experiences for the children, including interesting facts, plant weaving and ukulele lessons. The Paintbox staff was very creative and helpful and provided fun activities for the kids indoors and on the beach. Going to the beach is always at the top of my list. I have to say that the Beach Crew went above and beyond to make our time at the beach fun and comfortable. They made sure we had everything we needed for sand and water fun.

814201402,50,Luxury at its finest,"I have just returned from a 11 day 10 night stay at the Montage Resort at Kapalua Bay. In a word it was ""perfection""! The rooms themselves were outstanding. Fully equipped kitchen with high end appliances such as sub zero refrigerators, top of the line range and oven (did not use though). Dishwasher, washer and dryers and comfortable furniture through out. A fantastic balcony overlooking Kapalua Bay was such a wonderful treat!    The buildings and grounds were also first class. Pool was as nice as you will find anywhere, and it overlooked the bay, which made it such a beautiful experience.    There was a very clean and large beach adjacent to the property which had chair and snorkeling services. We saw all kinds of tropical fish and sea turtles. HUGE sea turtles!    All of these amenities are terrific, but if you don't have first class service, then its all for not! I can say from the moment we arrived, with a receptionist waiting for us in the lobby and greeted us by name to the time we left, everyone we encountered from the staff was professional, genuinely gracious and pleasant. No, is not part of their vocabulary and they tried so hard to make every experience outstanding.    We used all of their restaurants and drinking establishments. Food was expensive but very good. I would say the only drawback with these offerings were that the alcohol prices were exorbitant, compared to their peer establishments, as we visited many on the island.

813920613,50,A Wonderful Stay,"Our party of 6 (me, my wife, our two kids, and two grandparents) just got back from an incredible 8-night stay at Montage Kapalua. My wife and I had stayed there for our honeymoon 5 years ago, and it was just as magical as we remembered.    The location and grounds of this hotel are stunning. We hardly ventured off the property during our entire stay, and never got bored of the multi-leveled, waterfall-filled pool, and the turquoise waters and great snorkeling of nearby Kapalua Bay beach.    I have to give to special shout out to our concierge, Ayami, who helped us with every aspect of our stay and was always super helpful and responsive. Ayami arranged for a car and driver from and to the airport, booked all of our reservations at the restaurant on the property (Cane & Canoe), arranged to have groceries delivered to our room upon our arrival, and made sure we had every baby-related item we needed waiting for us in our room when we arrived.    All of the staff at the hotel were incredibly warm and friendly (the valets, the servers at Cane & Canoe-shout out to Guy, who take great care of us-the servers at the pool, the housekeeping staff, the guys working the beach shack (where you can rent snorkel gear, paddle boards, etc.). The only area that was inconsistent and needs improvement is the staff at the towel stand at the pool--sometimes we were greeted and immediately offered towels and chair set ups when we got to the pool, other times we were just handed towels, but not offered chair set ups, and other times still we were ignored and just grabbed towels and chair set up ourselves.    This is a great hotel for families. Having a washer/dryer in each residence was invaluable. It's also great to have a full kitchen in each residence. We cooked most mornings and nights, since sitting at a restaurant with a 4-year-old and 1-year-old is not very fun!    We were at the Montage in the beginning of October, and the weather was just about perfect. Sunny every day, with some clouds, and light rain here and there. If was pretty breezy every day, which I think is the norm for Kapalua. We didn't mind the wind-it actually helped cool us down from the warn sun.    We had a 2-bedroom ""Garden View"" residence, but were pleasantly surprised to find out that our room in fact had a great view of the ocean! We were in room 3203. It was great being on the ground level. Our kids loved being able to run out the living room and into the grassy garden areas of the hotel.

808160179,50,Absolutely incredible!,"I rarely write reviews of any kind. However, considering some of the recent posts in Trip Advisor and the nature of out experience at the Montage, I felt it would be important to draft this one commentary.  We were very reluctant to go to Hawaii. The COVID 19 pandemic certainly concerned us in general and the previous reports of short staffing , long lines and busy crowds almost led to our cancelling our trip. That being said, we had not travelled in a long time and planned on a very low key, low crowd vacation. Therefore, we took the leap and went.  Our stay at the Montage was superb! Certainly one of the best experiences we have had staying at any resort anywhere.  The first view of the ocean from the Montage main reception area should be your first Instagrammable moment. It was breathtaking !  We stayed at a two bedroom ocean view residence and the view of Lanai island was spectacular. There was plenty of room for our family of 4 and we made sure to allocate a part of each day to enjoy reading or just relaxing on our porch.  Food at the resort was amazing. I expected standard resort food, but the breakfast at Cane and Canoe was ridiculously good. I highly recommend the French Toast or the Pancakes for those of a sweet tooth persuasion. The Energy Bowl and the Oats are great if your are seeking healthier fare. We also had a dinner at Cane and Canoe and this was equally good and filling. Prepare for larger portions than you may anticipate when ordering. Strongly recommend the Brussel sprouts.  We had sushi at the Hideaway and it was as good or better than some of the take out we had ( e.g., Miso Phat ).  Fries and drinks by the pool were delicious and, suffice to say, he had them repeatedly.  Kudos to a lot of the servers. To name a few, Chris, Lindsey, Beth, Karen G and Melissa.  Housekeeping was incredibly accommodating. We actually requested changes in housekeeping times twice and were promptly attended to in both instances.  The swimming pool is beautiful and we did not feel crowded upon. It is true that our week was not a summer peak week and we may have had a more difficult time with chairs and such if we had gone during a different week. We heard a lot of talk about the infinity pools at the Andaz at Wailea and did stay there for one night. The Montage pools are way prettier.  Kapalua Beach is small but snorkeling is great! I barely went into the water and saw 6 or 7 varieties of fish. My son and his girlfriend saw two turtles lazily swimming around at dusk. They were non stop excited about it for the subsequent two hours.  Valets were great. When I turned in my rental car ( and a miracle it was to get one ) , I did not receive a slip. I asked how they would know which car was mine and the valet said that was not problem. And it was not. We went out a few times, and, each time, the car was available without any difficulty.  If you have children, the valets allow you to feed the koi fish in the entrance pond. Great fun!  The spa was beautiful and very peaceful. The therapists were very friendly and we all had a great experience as well.  Make sure to visit the nearby Dragon's Teeth close to the Ritz Carlton Kapalua. Short trip, great rewards, beautiful pictures. The valets took us and fetched us in the hotel vehicle and it was so easy! Parking lot at the trailhead is limited.  As to eating out, we tried Joey's Kitchen ( great! - garlic chicken major hit all around ) and Miso Phat ( not for the sushi purists or faint of heart ).  In summary, one of the best stays of our lives.  As a last remark, we made sure to acknowledge and thank everybody in the staff for their kindness and attention during this riling times. We were never shown anything other than true Hawaiian hospitality.  We would stay there again in a heartbeat.  -  PS. Thanks to Jared, Gerry and other members of the front desk/concierge team and to so many other people that made this a one of a kind stay.",Sep 2021,August 2021,,,

797846965,30,Skip Maui,"The property is beautiful but the service is average at best. I learned that staff keeps quitting including managers and it showed on the property. Garbage that was put there by housekeeping was left by our front door two nights in a row, the phone was not answered several times when we called for a variety of services and there were little to no dining options at the hotel and nearby. The closest beach is manned by ""The Beach Shack"" a privately owned operation that must charge the Montage for services provided to their guests. Their service is equally subpar and we were unable to get chairs one day and another day yelled (actually) for moving a chair. It was comical but certainly not five star. The people of Maui, and by extension the staff at the Montage, are not ready for visitors. Montage corporate should take a close look at this property. Their staff needs help and a daily walk on the property would show the many problems. We spent some time on the Big Island at the Four Seasons, Hualalai and it was exemplary. Go there instead.

796815631,50,"Excellent staff, though need to remedy pool chair issues","My family of 3 teens and 2 adults stayed here for 8 days. The staff was wonderful and made the vacation a great one - specifically I call out Misti for her unending patience as a concierge, the whole front valet staff for support (and quick rides), Rob at the pool bar for his hospitality, and Jeremy at the hideaway.    The rooms were incredibly spacious and the laundry so great to have, and the views amazing. Underlying a great stay was slow service at some of the restaurants, but the hotel is still recovering from getting staff back from COVID and was not at full staff while at full occupancy. So this was fine and understandable, and people should understand that and have some empathy for the efforts the staff that are there undertake.    One area that wasn't worth taking a star away but was a disappointment was the pool chair situation. Every morning by 7:30 all the pool lounges had towels, books, magazines, etc. reserved by other guests. That said, we watched many of these chairs not occupied until hours and hours later. I took a morning run to the Ritz where no chairs were ""reserved"" by old towels, but 15 minutes later at the Montage at 7:05 I found only 4 available chairs in the entire pool. Whether the pool staff is understaffed to police this, or what, it is not what I expected at a Montage - waking up at 6:00 for a pool lounge at several thousand a night is not correct in my view.    I spend time on that so management can hopefully address. Otherwise the stay as excellent, the concierge wonderful, and staff fantastic.",Jul 2021,June 2021,,,"Darien, Connecticut"
795735701,50,Fabulous Stay!,"We travelled as a family of 5 and stayed at the Montage for 6 nights. It was absolutely wonderful!!. Our kids are aged 10, 13 and 15 and it was great to have easy access to snorkeling and cliff jumping within a 2 minute walk from the pool. We were upgraded to a 3 bedroom residence through Amex and the room was specatular. It had great views of the ocean, comfortable beds, wide open terrace with a grill (although we didn't use this amenity), full washer/dryer (so great being able to fly home with clean clothes!), and lots of space. I also can't say enough great things about Rick, the concierge. He was so helpful with excursions and restaurant recommendations before we arrived and was so nice in person. He is the most ""on the ball"" concierge I have ever met! We were often greeted by name, which made the experience that much more personal, and small touches like loading our car with towels, waters and blankets before we drove to a surfing beach, really made us feel pampered. Yes, it is expensive, but you definitely get what you pay for. We highly recommend staying here. We all loved it!",Jul 2021,July 2021,,,New Jersey
795399239,10,REGRETTABLE CHOICE. NOISY. STAY ELSEWHERE,"I’m writing this review to objectively share, with other travelers considering the Montage at Kapalua Bay, our poor experience and the reasons I would never again stay at this resort and would strongly urge you to consider booking elsewhere when visiting Maui.    As reference, our family often travels domestically and internationally and we choose to stay in top-tier branded hotels/ resorts (Four Seasons, Belmond, Kempinski, etc.). This was our first stay at a Montage property and, likely, our last.    Our family of three travelled to Hawaii for a 2 week vacation, as our first post-COVID vacation. Our first 8 nights were spent at the Four Seasons Lana’i (5 star- world class resort) and then, on to the Montage Kapalua Bay for the remaining six nights.    In planning our trip segment for Maui, I decided between the Montage Kapalua Bay and Four Seasons Wailea. Unfortunately, I chose wrong, in choosing the Montage (we visited the Four Seasons Wailea for dinner at Spago and it is hands down a superior resort, location and atmosphere).    The Montage Kapalua Bay is located approximately 1 hour for the main airport.    The grounds have a beautiful view of the ocean and Molokai island across the channel. The pool has 4 levels and was, itself, enjoyable (though somewhat dated). There is a “club” pool that guests have access to that was nice but small. Unfortunately, this is where the pros of this resort end.    The pool staff are more concerned trying to solicit you to buy drinks from them, than actual service as to your comfort or peace. As well, the resort blocks off numerous pool loungers and chairs as “reserved” to nickel and dime their guests to pay extra for certain pool chairs….. seriously. I guess the $55 per day “ resort fee” doesn’t warrant certain pool chairs. What this fee covers, I have no idea, as there are no discernible benefits attributable to the added fee that one would not expect to receive at a top resort (fitness access, etc. There were many times, that most of the “reserved” chairs were empty as multiple other guests were unable to find adequate seating in the “free” chairs.    The “beach” is really more of a snorkeling bay. The entirety of our stay, it was overly crowded with a mixture of locals and visitors from other resorts. If you want to snorkel, the resort charges you may for equipment (the Four Seasons did not). This was in line with the general notion of the Montage Kapalua Bay’s business model of nickel and dime the guest.    We booked a 2 bedroom garden view suite. We were assigned a ground level unit that opened on to the main courtyard/pool common area. The room had a sizable terrace with comfortable seating and a nice view over the pool and down to the ocean. The room was clean.    When we travel, peacefulness is important as traveling is a time to recharge and rest, from our families busy life at home (my spouse and I are professionals with demanding jobs).    Our room at the Montage Kapalua Bay was horribly lacking in peace or quiet.    The beds in each bedroom were horribly uncomfortable. The sheets and comforter were of poor quality. More so confusing and as others have commented in their reviews, it is as if the housekeeping staff doesn’t know how to make a bed. There is no fitted sheet and the foot of the mattress is exposed. The beds at Montage Kapalua Bay are of a poor sleep quality.    This hotel is NOISY. Not only was our room situated next to an elevator and shared a corridor and common wall with a service quarters (both of which could easily be heard from the inside of our room.. continually throughout the day and night) the unit above us created constant stressful noise.    Our first night, as soon as the neighbors above us returned for the evening, we were kept up with continual noise of foot-steps, chairs being slid across the floor and causing reverberating sound and sliding doors being opened and closed (I do not believe the neighbors were intentionally being loud either, I believe the noise transfer is front he poor quality of the construction of this property)The construction quality of noise abatement between rooms and floors of this property is atrocious. The following morning, our upstairs neighbors activities dictated when our family was awoken (530am). This theme would continue the rest of our trip…. In that of being awoken by the noise of others.    The following morning, we addressed our concern with the on-duty manager (Ted). He was professional and listened to our concern about the noise from above. He did offer to refund the pro-rata balance of our stay (we had a prepaid rate) or, alternatively, block the room above from being occupied until our departure. We checked on availability at the Four Seasons Wailea and were not able to secure a room, so therefore stayed at the Montage. Ted followed up and was attentive to our concern and we were appreciative of his effort to help.    Unfortunately, even with the room above being vacant, the noise transfer from the elevator, service/housekeeping room adjacent to ours and the neighbors on our same level, there was not a morning we were able to sleep past 645am without being woken up by knocking sounds, slamming doors, elevators beeping and house keeping noise.    As an aside, and evidence of the complete discombobulation and poor execution of the resort, a few days after Manager Ted had graciously blocked the room above us, the housekeeping staff decided to clean the room starting around 7am. Of course, having the same effect of someone staying above and waking my entire family. As you’d expect, we were awoken due to the noise.    Each unit has a washer/dryer. Ours worked fine and we were glad to have it to use. Though, the dryer made a high pitched noise. When our neighbors used their dryer, we recognized the same high pitched noise coming through the wall to our unit. It was as if we had our own dryer on. Again, horribly noisy.    The compound that makes up the resort is not exclusively consisted of Montage units. There are other units ( I assume rentals or time shares); though, the buildings all look the same.    We ate at Cane and Canoe one night. Meh. Mediocre. The bread was good though and our waiter was nice. The restaurant is basically open air, so that was a plus with COVID concerns.    The main plus of this resort is the view. Though, you can receive the same view at other properties.    The peace, quiet and quality of Montage Kapalua Bay is severely lacking and I would strongly encourage you to research and choose other options when vacationing in Maui.    As a fitting post-script, the day we were leaving, the fire alarm went off at 530am for no apparent reason waking our entire family. The room has a deafening alarm that stunned us out of bed. Of course, no apology or remediation from the staff.    Stay elsewhere than the Noisy and Stressful Montage Kapalua Bay when vacationing on Maui.",Jul 2021,June 2021,Traveled with family,,Alabama

790504461,10,Is this a montage?,"I want to preface my review with a few points. I am updating it based on a few new experiences. Secondly, I have stayed at many luxury beach resorts around North America. Please read if you want my honest opinion based on my experiences of staying at some of the finest places in Hawaii, Mexico, and the Caribbean.    First and foremost, this does not stack up. It is not the employees’ fault. It’s poor management. Gabriel at the beach club was lovely. Kody kept our towels fresh at the pool and Lori was the only one to actually offer us mini snacks at the pool the entire week. Lydia who delivered us breakfast a few mornings genuinely seemed to care. Beyond them, most employees seems to be overstretched. One server for an entire pool. One front desk representative served as an operator, reservations assistant, concierge, room service order taker, and he even delivered food to us! Our dinner reservations were mixed up multiple times. Our breakfast came late most of the time and one day it didn’t come at all. This screams there is a lack of employees. Hell, this place doesn’t even have a pastries chef. Most other 5 star hotels I have stayed at have their own team dedicated to helping guide guests through the airport (this would have been a welcome amenity with covid chaos). And here, I can’t even get a croissant at breakfast let alone breakfast to show up on time. I couldn’t even get through to the front desk (often on endless on hold rings to no avail).    The rooms are definitely the selling point. These are probably the finest residences in Maui. They are starting to show age with spotted carpets, flies stuck in windows, and bird crap on our balcony that would never get cleaned.    The landscaping and exterior are pretty abysmal. Dead foliage and tree branches abound. Rust stains on walls everywhere.    I previously gave them 3 stars and dropped to one. I did this because I heard a woman bragging at the beach about how she tipped valet 50 bucks to park her car here and how they even gave her a shuttle to the beach. I also noticed several other “guests” draped in towels holding snorkel bob gear (I saw them at the pool) get into cars in the lobby. I can’t say anything for certain but you can read between the lines here.    I took away another star (and updated the review a third time) because a valet verbally accosted me during checkout. Our cab was late and I mentioned how most properties have their own SUV and airport staff. He started laughing and arguing.    Overall, this property is only interested in using covid as an excuse to save money. The tell tale sign was how no one even asked us how our stay was. They have no issues overcrowding the pool or beach if it means extra money. If you are going to pay north of 2,000 a night, consider getting a private villa at parrot cay or beach front home at las ventanas. It’s less money there, you will get legitimate service, and they will value your presence. It’s clear the management here only cares about making a profit. To say I feel taken advantage of as a guest is an understatement.    In sum, if you don’t know what it’s like to experience real luxury (les clefs d’or concierge, butlers trained in Switzerland, French trained chefs), you will be happy. If you do know the difference, you’ll leave feeling upset you wasted your money. Every request even minor ones are met with “no” and excuses. Consider staying somewhere that’s half the price and tipping the valet to leave your car here for the day to feel like you are staying at a luxury resort.”  Read less  Date of stay:",May 2021,May 2021,Traveled with family,,los angeles

We were able to snorkel and the water was so clear you could easily spot the sea turtles.

789023893,50,Perfect in Every Way!,"So much to tell about my stay at the Montage but why we chose this place, may resonate with others. Although we have stayed many places on Maui, this trip we would need a handicap accessible situation for my husband who would be mending from knee replacement surgery and a broken pelvis. We live on a ranch in Wyoming and the weather was not agreeable to complete his recovery so after much research regarding accessibility, we were off to Maui and a two-bedroom condo at the Montage Hotel.  After he was cleared to travel and tested Covid-free we arrived in paradise for our handicap accessible vacation. We were greeted by very personal concierge staff and explained all the details regarding our villa. Everyone at Montage comfortably welcomed us to our “home.” The best of the best for a wheelchair rendezvous with the accessible pool, beach, restaurant, sunset and beautioful lobby. All levels were accessible and easily navigated. It was a pleasure to always have somewhere to wheel to!  Our favorite became the walkway along the drive through a narrow grove of beautiful tropical greens on our way to the spa. The services offered at Montage for my husband were easily adapted for his needs and he really enjoyed his time “working out” at the spa. Personally, I enjoyed reading my book outside on the bench in the beautifully landscaped garden surrounding the spa and listening to the endless birds. The grounds everywhere were so quiet and relaxing.  Almost every evening provided some kind of entertainment. Within a short walk, we could watch the sunsets, hear the live ukulele music, see the surfers, cliff divers and watch the whales at play. The hotel also helped us secure a wheelchair van and driver for anything outside the Montage.  Every level of our experience here has provided an amazing vacation in Maui. We cannot imagine staying any place other than the Montage and fully intend to return next year. Our hope is we will not need the wheelchair by then and the same wonderful staff will still be working here. They will once again share such Aloha spirit.",May 2021,March 2021,,Every room has a beautiful view!,

787803513,20,expected much more for what we paid,"This place really depends on what you want out of your vacation. The rooms were spectacular, especially the lanai, and we were able to cook a few dinners in too. The location was much quieter than other places in town. We also stayed at the Four Seasons in Wailea before coming here. The view was wonderful here. The Kapalua Coastal Trail was definitely a must see. The spa was perfect. There were a couple of shining stars: Byron in valet was so helpful and went out of his way to assist us. Kehei, the Hana Hou bartender, was simply spectacular. We will always remember him from our trip here. Everyone working in Housekeeping and Room service were very kind and willing to help.    However, besides the people listed above, the service was horrible, especially at the on-site restaurants and pool. We always had to flag someone down to find our server. The server never came back to your table, if you were able to get them to come to your table in the first place. The food wasn't anything too impressive either. The beach service was not great. There was only one guy working the entire time, and because the other person was out all week we couldn't get snorkel equipment or kayaks from them at all. There was an on-site shop with coffee and clothes but no snacks, which was disappointing. Every time you would try to call room service, front desk, etc... it would put you through a message loop and you would have to hang up, try again and hope it would go through.

787737537,20,A Nice View and Not Much Else,"There is no denying that the location is one of the best on the island. However, if you are looking for more than a nice view I would recommend one of the other luxury resorts on the island.    The pools are nice but the level of service didn't meet expectations. The lady serving us the first day was struggling to keep up even though it wasn't very busy at the pool. If you try to go up to the bar (they only have one) to order yourself, they direct you back to your seat to wait for the server. Stay away from the beers, they are warm by the time they make it to you.    Dining options are limited. Cane & Canoe is typical resort food, nothing special. I would choose any restaurant at the Four Seasons or Ritz over it. There is not much seating for lunch. We were forced to eat by the pool because there were no tables available.    Beware that they will tack on parking charges when you check-out. You would think that spending nearly $20,000 in three days would be enough, but they had to add on $70/night for parking 2 vehicles.    The level of service is generally good, but on my way to check out I was trapped in an elevator for 45 minutes. Luckily I still had cell phone service so I was able to text my wife and she could call the front desk to let them know I was stuck. They assured us they ""were working on it"" but a little bit more urgency would have been appreciated as we had a flight to catch. After I was freed, nobody seemed to be concerned about me. In fact, the lady at the front desk during check out was actually quite rude about it. We were not offered anything for our troubles.

Any detail from menus to place settings were flawless. When dinner was cleared away, we wanted the menu as a keepsake, so the staff made sure to get one to us without hesitation.

During our stay the hotel staff went out of their way to make sure we were taken care of. From the valet, to the pool attendants to the bartenders and restaurant staff. The hotel is gorgeous and the grounds are beautiful. The rooms are modern and offer every amenity you need. We cooked several meals in the room and had everything we needed. The beach is a short walk and has fantastic snorkeling with turtles and plenty of tropic fish in a safe and calm bay. There is also lovely walking trails to another nearby beach and beautiful lava field. The pool system is elaborate and kept our teens well entertained. The only slight issue we had was some wind and a bit of rain but I think it was the time of year and a storm system that was blowing through.

779900145,40,Last Minute Escape,"Testing to get here was extremely stressful but once here, what a relief!  Our room was cleaned nicely, daily: any dishes (intentionally or unintentionally) left behind were cleaned/put away, tea towels refolded and put back to their hanging position, obviously trash and dirty linen was picked up, water bottles in the fridge were refilled without asking, detergent/dryer sheets are provided so you can skip a trip to the store if you want to wash any clothes during your stay (love this!!), maui coffee was supplied in the kitchen (what a nice touch). Housekeeping team was so very thoughtful with their daily service: I had unintentionally left coffee in the pot when heading to the pool for the day but came back to find not only was the pot/filter clean, but the coffee maker had been put back nicely and everything surrounding it was in order. What attention to detail, brava to the housekeeping team. I wish I knew who was assigned our room: they really impressed us with their proactivity.  A few individuals listed below have also stood out so far...  Anna, at concierge, helped coordinate multiple days of activities, even (patiently) assisting when plans had to be moved around. She was prompt, courteous and genuinely interested in helping us/hearing how our experiences were.  The pool service was clearly stretched thin (covid staffing, totally understandable), but there are definitely a few I wish to make mention of: Zanobe and Kody shined at the serenity pool with their attentiveness and genuine care/concern in regards to meeting my preferences (which was a challenge to say the least: mix of sun and shade, away from groups/children screaming). They both were hospitable and never once made my requests seem like a burden.  Noah, also at the pool, went out of his way to roll me a fresh towel while I was at the pool stand, just to watch me unroll it right in front of him (as he passed it to me, he made mention that it was ""a 5 star roll""..I can appreciate his mentality and care to every towel, which, at this point of his day, he was almost up to his eyeballs with them).  Armando, in the kitchen, made me some of the best fish tacos while at the pool.  The bartender working Christmas Eve at the pool, created a great off menu cocktail for me to enjoy based off of my flavor preferences. Hoping my compliments reach both/all of them...  What a way to spend Christmas!  We are not even finished our stay but I am so looking forward to finding more shining stars around the property during the next week..

779262732,50,Still exceeds all expectations - well worth the COVID testing,"We first stayed at the Montage Kapalua Bay in May 2014. We’ve been back twice a year since. At the end of our first trip we wrote a review saying that the Montage was so wonderful that we wished we could give them more than 5 stars. Nothing has changed.    The condo style units include a full-size Sub Zero Refrigerator, a wine cooler and every appliance and utensil that you have at home. The kitchen is kept stocked with local Maui coffee. There’s a washer and dryer stocked with detergent. The bedrooms and bathrooms are luxurious and the deck is massive. The grounds are pristine with fantastic pools and one of the best snorkeling beaches sits right outside the door.    The Montage’s first class accommodations are matched and even exceeded by the quality of the staff. Anna, the concierge, is absolutely wonderful. She’s on top of every detail before we even arrive. Restaurant reservations are nailed down and the pillows we like are waiting in the room. She anticipates every need throughout our trip. Last year she spotted our eight year old daughter crying on her way back to the room after being stung by a jelly fish. Without being asked, she ran to the restaurant, got some vinegar, delivered it to the room and told us how to treat the sting.    Ahlea in reservations is joy to work with. Our schedules changed numerous times this year because of COVID. We booked, cancelled, changed and then rebooked and then added nights three times as school and work situations were updated. Each time, Ahlea cheerfully adjusted our reservation and somehow kept me on track with the paperwork.    The guys at the ""beach shack"" (Kapalua Bay Beach Crew), Ricky, Teehee and Zach, are the nicest guys in the world. They get chairs and umbrellas set up and later check to see if anything needs adjustment as the sun changes position. The valet guys are great too. They offer to bring groceries in and always have a cold bottle of water ready for the asking. Kristina in the restaurant knows I like my coffee very hot. So rather than topping off my cup she brings a fresh one several times during breakfast. Evan in housekeeping remembered that my daughter loves to draw. So she left extra paper on her desk every day.    Finally, I can’t say enough good things about the Paintbox kids club. The Paintbox is not a warehouse where kids play video games all day. Sherri and Ashleigh take them on nature hikes where they study wildlife and the tide pools. They cook pizza and cookies in a solar oven. Auntie Silla teaches them about Hawaiian culture, like making a lei and playing the ukulele. They roam the beach in search of coral. It’s a great program. However, my daughter does miss her friend Chelsea who has moved from the Paintbox to now managing the Montage's 5-star spa.    We’ve stayed at many of the best hotels throughout the world. While the service at the Montage is less formal and a more relaxed Hawaiian style, it’s every bit as attentive and personalized as what’s offered at the finest hotels in Asia.    Normally, it feels good to head home after a long trip, even after staying at a five star resort or hotel. But we never feel that way about leaving the Montage. We were at the Montage for 24 days this trip and my daughter cried the night before we left. I wanted to cry too. The Montage Kapalua Bay always leaves us wanting more. It’s all the comforts of your own home in the middle of the most luxurious five-star resort.",Dec 2020,November 2020,,,
777827531,50,"Pre-Travel Testing Update/Montage Ownership, Two thumbs up!","We spent most of 2020 rescheduling our annual Maui visits, but jumped on a plane mid November, about a month after Hawaii launched the pre-travel testing option to avoid quarantine. We are based in Austin, Texas and unfortunately, many of the state approved testing options were simply not available, nor would comply with the 72 hour requirement. So, we opted for an at-home lab test 'Let's get checked' and we had our results within 24 hours. I'm not sure if that is standard or if we were just lucky, but the turnaround was impressive.    Many of you might be asking, is the process and testing worth the trouble? I can only share our experience, but in short, yes. Once you have the process in action and test results pending, or in hand, it's really quite easy. (I will caution you, HI approved testing partners are required, and they take this very seriously. You will find yourself in quarantine, or back on a plane returning home if your test does not comply. Read the fine print, and make sure the approved labs are actually approved for your state.) Upon arrival, the check in process at the airport very efficient and fast. Jumping through the Hawaii hoop is a little tedious the first time, but once you are through it, it's really not that bad.    We own a fractional at the Montage Kapalua and spend about 4 weeks per year on island, at our Montage Maui home. It is always a pleasure and a privilege returning to the Montage. The positive experience begins the second we pull into the driveway and are greeted by the valet staff and front-of-house. Very 'aloha' and welcoming. The extra support continues to check-in where we are always greeted with a bottle of bubbles or something welcoming in our condo. We are relatively new Montage owners, but our unit is always impeccably sorted, clean and in great shape. The housekeeping staff services the units twice per day, which is very nice. The housekeepers learn your habits and will accommodate requests for the best time for room servicing, also very nice.    The Montage grounds are always equally sorted and just gorgeous! There is nothing like the view from this property. My first visit to Maui was actually in Kapalua where I stayed at the old Kapalua Bay Hotel (circa early 2000's) which rested on the Montage property. The old hotel was flattened to make space for the Montage at Kapalua Bay. The views remain unchanged from years past, but the new property is a major improvement as the old hotel was losing it's classic shine and charm.    The Montage staff throughout the property from the Hideaway lounge to the pool staff are all fabulous. Covid19 has been difficult on the locals, so there is extra aloha extended as they are very happy to see returning travelers. I've previously reviewed the Montage, so I'll spare some of the traditional details, but will say that we have found everything to be 100%, 5 star and just as the property was on our first visit....    Regarding Ownership: If you are considering fractional ownership on Maui, or a timeshare, I thought I would explain why we decided to become Montage owners vs some other options including remaining traditional renters.    Over the past twenty years, I have literally stayed in pretty much all Hawaii 4, 5 star hotels on all islands, and I do have some favorites...But, when we stayed at the Montage for the first time, we quickly knew that nothing really compared and it uniquely fit our criteria. Here's why. We like 5 star properties, excellent service, great food options, nice gyms/spas, private adult pools and oceanfront locations...We have high standards and do not make excuses for how we like to travel in Hawaii.    While preferring 5 star experiences, we also enjoy the extra room a condo provides with condo amenities vs a typical hotel room. Unfortunately, our condo experiences on HI islands in the past were more 3 star, riddled with loud kids, large families, bad food, crowded everything and generally not a good fit for what we seek in a vacation experience. These 3 star condo experiences were almost always cut short and we ended up back at the five star hotel properties we love.    Here's the Maui dilemma...Finding a five star hotel experience + a condo roominess/amenities experience is a stretch on Maui.    Montage does a nice job of bringing a five star hotel experience to roomy residential condos in a gorgeous environment with all the amenities we desire. The setting is less people-dense than most properties (which is nice right now) and it just feels very residential, peaceful, quiet and comfortable. Montage is #1 pick for us and checks all boxes, and now we can say we own a little bit of Maui dirt, well, at least we have the dirt 4 weeks each year....I will say as a Hyatt Residence owner, we have stayed many times at the Hyatt Kaanapali Residences and we absolutely love this 4 star property. So, if Kapalua is too remote for you, consider the Hyatt for either rental, or share purchase. We are not fans of the Westin timeshare property, you can find my Westin review if you are interested.    So, I hope this was helpful. I thought some of you out there might like to travel like we do and might be considering a purchase. Thanks for hanging in there reading this long piece. I'm always open to taking any questions.

777228936,50,Montage at Kapalua,"The Montage at Kapalua was pristine - from the service, to the room, food, spa, pool and beach as well as the property itself. While visiting during the pandemic the hotel ensured that cleanliness was consistent - safety was a priority and client service was EXCELLENT!! Anna our concierge was amazing and booked everything for us on and off the property. She was enthusiastic, professional and courteous and responsive in every way. At the Montage the team’s focus is making sure you have a first rate experience. If you are going to Maui - this is the place to stay - it is elegant and refined. We’ve stayed at other resorts on Maui but this is the one that we will always stay at going forward.    The location, service, amenities and the room is unsurpassed (huge with full kitchen and sub zero refrigerator, dishwasher, big dining table, full living room, wine refrigerator, walk in closet, 2 bathrooms, amazing bedroom, beautifully decorated with first rate finishes and an impressive balcony). I felt guilty not using such a beautifully appointed kitchen. We are in property and off each day and evening. You can reserve adjacent rooms easily to adjust the configuration for a family stay.

747115678,50,Beyond amazing Hawaii vacation resort,"I think you would be hard-pressed to find a more perfect resort anywhere. Our family of 10 stayed in a 4 bedroom, 4000 s.f. residence for 8 nights. Before we left, I prepared myself to accept this would be one of those resorts where every time you turn around, it's another $100 or more. Actually the opposite was true. They do not gouge you for every little thing. They brought us free tea and honey for my daughter who had a cold, soy sauce from the market that we forgot to buy, stuffed animals for the kids, coffee, a rubber ball for my 2 year old grandson to play with and the list goes on. When you do pay for something extra, it is of the highest quality and reasonably priced. Meals and drinks are not inexpensive but are priced comparable to all the upper-end hotels in this area and are excellent. The staff is amazing; every person from housekeeping and valet to the spa attendants, fitness class instructors, concierges and pool attendants. We were treated like royalty. The mermaid class for little girls is absolutely adorable. Sara, the instructor was darling, and my granddaughters were in heaven. The accommodations were beyond wonderful (the master bath was larger than most bedrooms) and everyone felt so pampered and relaxed. We had a ground floor residence that faced the ocean and was so perfect for young kids to be able to play outside on the gorgeous lawn and go back and forth to the pool without taking an elevator or stairs. Perfect. We took advantage of their complementary on-site photography session to capture our vacation, and I am so glad we did this. Beautiful photography and with very little effort on our part. I agree there are less expensive places to stay, but I'm convinced you won't find a better value any where. My only request (and this is for all resorts, not just Montage) is that they put more effort into eco-friendly practices. Delivering thousands of single use water bottles all day long is beyond terrible. If they had refillable water stations with reusable cups throughout the resort, it would make such a difference. Also, the ability to recycle paper and plastics in the rooms/residences would be an easy practice to accommodate. I would love to see Montage take the lead in making environmental practices at large resorts the norm, not the exception. All of us cannot wait to go back to this resort again. My 4 year old granddaughter says she wants to go every Thursday and Friday! Thank you, Montage, for making this trip so memorable for my family.",Feb 2020,February 2020,,,

730832724,40,An Almost-Perfect Experience,"My wife and I stayed three nights at the Montage as part of our honeymoon last month. This is a beautiful, sprawling property a bit off the beaten trail from Lahaina. There are seemingly endless pools and seating cascading down towards the ocean. Although there were a few families staying at the resort, we found this hotel to be far quieter and more romantic than the Four Seasons Wailea. Cane and Canoe was great for dinner, and we enjoyed the attentive poolside service for lunch and drinks. The rooms are simply unparalleled for the price—we reserved the base room, which was as 1200-sqft apartment featuring a full kitchen, washer/dryer, power room, large closet, high ceilings, and a spacious terrace. For all of these reasons, we were pretty much in love with the resort from the moment we arrived.    Unfortunately, one bad experience left us with a bad taste in our mouths, and may prevent us from ever returning in the future. On the second day of our stay, we returned back from a waterfall rappelling excursion and wrapped our wet clothes in hotel towels, which we then left on the washing machine to wash and dry later. After returning from dinner, we realized the towels—with our clothes inside—were missing, and this was a few hundred dollars worth of clothing. We immediately realized that housekeeping must have made an honest mistake and swept up the towels and clothes while cleaning the room. However, after we asked housekeeping about this, they vehemently denied taking the clothes, insisting that there's no possible way they would have done this. We then spoke with a front desk associate, who informed us that if the clothes were indeed taken by accident, they were already sent out to the linen cleaning company, but that there was a good chance they'd be returned the next day. So we went back to the front desk the following morning, and they told us our clothes had been found, and they would be arrive back at the hotel at 2pm, which happened to be the same time we were checking out of the resort. At 2pm, there was still no sign of our clothes or any indication when they may arrive. The same front desk associate assured us, as he had before, that he would follow up with us to provide updates.    Two more days passed without so much as a courtesy email or call from the resort. At this point our patience was waning and we hadn't received so much as a simple apology, so we called and asked to speak with a manager, who told us ""some"" of our clothes had been found, and assured us that he would provide updates on the rest within a day or two. Well, another couples days passed and still nothing. Finally, he called to tell us that a few of our items were still missing, but he would ship us what they did find. He also refunded our Cane and Canoe dinner, which we thought was fair compensation for the outstanding missing items. As of this writing, the few missing items are still missing, but the clothes they did find were successfully shipped back to us.    While we ultimately reached an acceptable conclusion to the saga, it was a very disappointing experience. We understand mistakes happen even at the nicest of hotels, but the Montage's nonchalant, unapologetic reaction was not up to par for an otherwise-fantastic resort. I'm still giving the Montage Four Stars in the hopes that this was a very rare, one-off lapse in guest services, but felt it was only fair to share our experience.",Dec 2019,November 2019,,,"Animas Bajas, Mexico"

Check in was a breeze, you wait in an open area while a personal attendant checks you in. The rooms are well situated with great, large lanais. The pools and gardens are excellent. It is a nice private feeling, relaxed pace getaway compared to the bustle of Kaanapali Beach. We drove to nearby restaurants most often instead of dining at the hotel. The nearby Dragon's Teeth hike is unworldly and is right next door. We also walked to Merriman's which was convenient and one of the top rates restaurants on the island. The nearby beach was lovely, fish right at your feet. The fitness center was lovely, very clean, excellent attendants and trainers, all equipment was in top shape. They offer complimentary fruit and feminine products. (I don't think any resort can be considered five star if they don't offer both of these things.)    A few notes:  Sound carries on the lanais, this is true of every Hawaiian resort, so you hear conversations and one screaming child can ruin your peaceful day. We even went in November and there were still lots of babies, toddlers and school age children at the resort, though far less than would be in the summer.    The service is excellent but can be a bit over-bearing. If you don't want to make constant small talk with your valets this may not be the place for you.    The restaurants were limited, Cane and Canoe feels a bit stuffy though we did enjoy the Blood Mary bar and breakfast. The other venue is a bar and has loud live music, not relaxing. There are many options very close by high and low end so this did not affect us much. The Champagne Hale venue was closed while we were there but was open weeks before and the week after, we would have liked to try it.    This resort is mostly much further set back from the ocean than other resorts with spread out landscaping and buildings. I love walking around and exploring but if you want everything very close, this may not be the place for you.    The AC was a bit on the sustainable side, not as cool as we like it.

721552976,50,Always amazing,"My wife and I stay here almost every year. We have stayed at different times of the year. Each stay is always unbelievable. The pool area is separated very well between kids and adults. The view of the ocean is one of the best! One thing I have noticed in the reviews is the lack of mentioning the fitness center. I love to work out. The spa and fitness center have a great selection of free weights and machines for working out. They could probably add more weighted plates to their free bench but more reps is ok. The staff is of course what you would expect for a place like this, very accommodating and friendly. The residences are very nice and roomy. If you want to spend the money for a higher end accommodation, this is definitely a place you will want to try.",Oct 2019,October 2019,,Ask for ocean view. you wont be disapointed!,
720473417,40,Wonderful property!,We stayed at the Montage during the first part of our honeymoon and had a peaceful time. The bellmen and concierge were all very friendly! We had a wonderful room with a lovely view of the grounds and ocean. The rooms were clean and we were greeted with a bottle of champagne and honeymoon cupcakes. All of the food was pretty good. I would recommend this hotel more for families than honeymooners. It is a little too spread out/quiet. The area is great though and on the pretty side of the island and the grounds itself are drop dead gorgeous.,Oct 2019,October 2019,,,"Austin, Texas"
719664347,50,Welcome to Paradise!,"This is our last day at the Montage, and this resort is amazing! We are traveling with 5 kids ranging from 15-10 yrs old and they are having a blast. The pool at the resort is kinda divided into little areas, great for the kids to explore. One of the pools is 16yrs and up but the others are for families with young children. I LOVE the fact that I don't have to run out the pool at some godly hour to save seats for my family, We have not had an issue with finding chairs together (12 people all together) at any hour of the day. The service by the pool has been great, they are prompt in bringing menus and servicing our group. They also bring around ice cold water and little snacks! The rooms are great! They are new and have plenty of room for the whole family. We're staying in a 4 bedroom. The room has an amazing kitchen, and patio! Ask for room 1101 if you need a 4 bedroom! This room is on the ground floor with amazing views, it also has a huge grassy area for the kids to run around. That has been so nice for the kids to run outside and throw the ball or just hang out! I would highly recommend this room to anyone with a large family with kids!!! The room is also positioned right between the pool and the beach! Couldn't have asked for a better location on the resort. The beach is small but clean and safe for the kids to run around and swim in the water. We also were able to rent SUP,Boogie boards, snorkel gear and chairs for the day. I believe the chairs are complimentary if you are staying at the Montage but I have to be honest, I've kinda given up on keeping track of what we are charged for. :) This resort has been perfect, and we will definetly stay here again! We were planning on staying at the Ritz, but I'm glad that we chose Montage becuase the Ritz is not on a beach and even further from town then the Montage.",Oct 2019,October 2019,,Room 1101- amazing 4 bedroom on ground level with a huge yard for kids to run around,"Cherry Hills Village, Colorado"

Great pools, and even though it was almost full, never felt crowded.",Oct 2019,June 2019,,,
716138309,40,"Quiet, intimate, but lacks service & amenities that make a 5 star stand out","Overall this hotel is great and I'd stay here again. It's perfect for kids too. There is a walking path that takes you to multiple beaches close by and I like the Kapalua area. The hotel is smaller, private, and feels intimate. I do have feedback/complaints though about the service and food.    Rooms - rooms are huge, they have a full kitchen, living area, and 2 bathrooms. It even has a washer and dryer. Loved the rooms. It's a great place to stay for a few days, because you can cook and really make yourself at home. The rooms were clean, and had nice decor.    Pool - Loved the pool. It was amazing. The view is amazing too and the sunset from there is gorgeous. I love how there are different levels and areas you can sit so you feel like you're in a new area each day. The service was quick and the pool attendants were very attentive and nice. What we didn't like is that there are ""reserve"" seats that you have to pay extra for. The pool was empty, yet you couldn't sit in these prime areas because you had to pay. It wasn't just a cabana, but lounge chairs as well. You're paying enough for the hotel I think it's pretty ridiculous to charge you more for certain chairs.    Food - We ate at Cane and Canoe and were disappointed. Restaurant service was extremely slow for both breakfast and dinner here. We went to Cane and Canoe 3 years ago and it was our favorite restaurant so we were excited to come again. We were very disappointed. Breakfast was also bad. I had the egg white frittata, the description seemed like it had greens and tomatoes in it, and it was an egg white omelet with mushrooms in it, and half a tomato thrown on top and a green salad on the side. It was gross. Every breakfast was disappointing actually. We ended up eating off property the rest of the nights - go to Joeys Kitchen in Napili (it's an amazing hole-in-the-wall type place).    Spa - I got a massage in the outdoor cabana. The masseuse was really really knowledgeable and good. It was nice doing it outside, although there was construction going on. They did offer to do it inside but I wanted to experience the outdoor cabana so I went in to it knowing there would be construction. The women's area that has the cold rain shower, lounge, and outdoor hot tub was really dirty so I didn't use it. It had rained that morning so there was dirt and leaves all over the chairs and floor so it wasn't really appealing to use. It would have been nice if it had been cleaned. I was over charged for the massage and when I asked the lady checking us out about it on our last day, (since it was charged to the room) they told me it was the total cost and showed me the final receipt of the price they charged. However, I had a photo of the receipt I signed and the total cost was different from what they charged me. So basically the spa added to the final amount before submitting it. I thought it was a tax or something but when I looked at what I signed, tax was included. It wasn't much, just a few $, but the fact that the spa added a few dollars (or maybe it was a mistake?) to the total bill is wrong, and when I told the check-out lady what the total was supposed to be, they said it was right.    Overall Service - The guys at the front/bell boys were super friendly and they will drive you anywhere close by, and pick you up, which is great to have if you don't have a car.    Room service was seriously lacking. They came in at really odd times to clean. We would be gone all day and come back in the late afternoon to get ready for dinner, and the room still not cleaned. Then they would come for turn down service at 8:30-9pm some nights when we were already back at the hotel and getting ready for bed. So we only got turn down service one night because of this. We had to call and have them clean our room to make sure it was cleaned while we were gone.    My biggest complaint was the bed. We both slept terribly. The beds were made so poorly every day that I had to remake the bed every night before sleeping. There is no fitted sheet so they use regular sheets as the ""fitted"" sheet and they never tucked it in anywhere, nor did it extend to the bottom of the bed. So the first night the sheets completely came off the bed and were tangled and we were sleeping directly on the mattress. The second night I realized they weren't even covering the bottom of the bed, so when you got in, your feet were touching the foam and mattress which grossed me out. I called to ask if they had fitted sheets or if they could make the bed properly and problem was never resolved. Also, the sheets were just scratchy and uncomfortable (we came from the FS Lanai and the sheets were soo incredibly soft). Attached are photos of the bottom of the bed.    The hotel doesn't provide you with anything except coffee. Tea would have been nice since there is a tea kettle and all hotel rooms always provide tea. Also, what makes a 5 star stand out are the little amenities and extra things. For example, if they had brought pastries in the morning, or had some fruit every day in the room, it would have been a nice touch. We got a plate of cheese the first day since we were celebrating our baby moon, but I've stayed places where they would put a little surprise in your fridge or counter every day you got back to the room.    When we got out of the car with our luggage, there were 2 people there and no one helped us with all our bags, and there was a lot. One lady was on the phone and the other man, I'm not sure what he was doing. I would think you would put the person on the phone on hold and then help the guests who are actually there.    With all that being said, I would stay here again and it was a really nice hotel overall. The pool/view/and huge rooms are amazing. Coming from the Four Seasons Lanai, (which actually was cheaper per night), where the service was outstanding, we were a little disappointed here. Price wise, I've stayed at other hotels at the same price point and they exceeded expectations in the service/amenity area which is what made them stand out. This just doesn't quite fit the criteria for a 5 star hotel to us when we compare it to other hotels we've stayed at.",Oct 2019,October 2019,,,"San Jose, California"

Don’t miss sitting at the lowest level also called the family pool- it has a beautiful view of the ocean. We loved having so much space and a full kitchen where we could make coffee and cocktails.

711238755,50,What an Incredible Vacation at the Montage,"This is our first time in Maui and Our fisrt experience with a Montage Resort, What a Trip , The architecture of the hotel is wonderful , The entrance is a beautiful bridge with a Koy Fish Pond , Check in was perfect , quick and efficient , They offer us fruit and fresh towels , Ben took us to our room at the moment hours before check in Time , really apprecciate it , even talk to us in spanish, ( We are visiting from Mexico) The residence was beautiful, with full kitchen equipment , fridge , and laundry room with detergent. Huge Lanai with furniture always clean , We took advantage and had breakfast facing the ocean. We have dinner at Cane and Canoe two times , and special thanks to the hostess , dont remember her name , but very professional and kind. The food was really good , We have a Wuagyu Beef and Hatori Chicken and the waiter offer to bring to us all the salsas they have so we could try wich one we prefer, even some macarrons to take out to our room. The pool design is the most beautiful I ever seen, We enjoy the adult pool , everybody around was super respectul and quiet , so all the guest could enjoy their time, The pool staff took care of us with water, towel , sunblock and food Menu. We have lunch twice by the pool and the food was excellent and very well served. Expensive of course , But you know you are in Hawai. The spa facilities are incredible , Really enjoy a time there , and the ladies at the Gift Shop were very informative , We get some beauty treatments to take home. The resort is at the windy part of the island , During winter season , this is not the place you want to choose , Go to Lahaina or Wailea Instead. The beach club is small and the umbrellas and chairs quite unconfortable , you Notice right away that the hotel is not in charge of that area , We choose the póol instead. Oh ! Forgot to thank Ben at Checkout he give us a Plush Whale Toy for my nephew , What a lovely gift  Some Details to Improve  - We request at check in some help with the sofa bed , of the 5 days we were at the hotel , just 1 the sofa bed was made , the other days I just sleep in the sofa with the extra blanket they provided. They need better communication with that details  - Zero information about the shuttle service around the area , I would have apprecciate to know that information at check in, It would have been useful to us  - The spa area of the steam room and sauna dont have Emergency Buttons , We never saw any member of the staff in that area and I think is need it  - The internet simply dont work , If you need it for anything in particular get your own from home    We had a wonderful vacation , Cant wait to visited the Montage Cabo. Thanks to all the Staff for their hard work . And for the Travelers , its low season in Maui , the prices are better , theres very few people, and the weather is great.

710981973,50,"Maui, Maui, Maui","My son’s birthday was at the end of August and I offered him a trip as a gift. He chose Hawaii the week before we left and I had never been. My daughter joined us so we were three adults. I chose the Montage because I have stayed at the LA and Laguna properties. Also, I was able to book a three bedroom apartment with washer/dryer and a state of the art kitchen. I chose a lanai room instead of ocean view because it was less expensive. ( Also the big secret at Montage resorts is all the rooms face the ocean , some have better views so be sure to ask). The advantage of this room is that it had a huge lanai and you could walk out and go to the pool or beach. The other advantage was that it was very quiet. This particular room looked as though it was newly decorated and was immaculate. I’m not sure if the entire hotel is made up of apartments but it seemed that way.  My vacation started with conversations with Ben. He is a very dedicated concierge who helped me plan my entire trip including : room, private tour to road to Hana and sunset, oo farms , a half day on the Trilogy ( a gorgeous catamaran) and a helicopter ride. We were also fortunate enough to eat at Merrrimans, Lahanai Grill, Paia’s Fish House ,Sensai and Mamma’s Fish House.  First let me say that this resort is beautiful and well located on a bay that has swimming and snorkeling. You can get a chair and umbrella and sit on the beach where you can rent snorkel equipment. There is a small beach club for owners but you can go there to use the smaller pool, bathroom and bar. The pools are beautiful but not a lot of sun cover. I rented a Day bed and while a couple would enjoy it , it provides no shade. The pool staff helped me find shade every day but the beach with umbrellas was more my style.  The staff here is the best of any hotel that I have stayed at because everyone was pleasant and doing their best. Room service was excellent and on time. The breakfast was delicious. We enjoyed eating in the room because there are birds around the breakfast area but we did both. I had a massage at the spa. The masseuse was good.The outside area was ok, I think I should have tried inside. The spa and workout area are in a separate building.  This hotel is in West Maui. It’s about an hour from the airport and most tourist attractions. I grew up driving so I didn’t mind driving to attractions after I rented a car. The traffic can be daunting but the quiet and the beaches in west Maui were worth it . The valet staff is phenomenal. They get your car and make sure you have water and towels when you need them.Also the Montage caters to families and has classes and programs to keep everyone entertained. I loved having my own room and each of my adult children having their own room!  My only complaint was that the WiFi and TVs never worked even after the engineer came to fix them. My children had phones from work and my son had his own WiFi. If you stay at the Montage I would suggest you get your own WiFi before you come. The manager adjusted the bill somewhat but seven days was a long time without these services. We spent a lot of time laughing at the sign on the tv to call the front desk and watching twenty minutes of our favorite shows. You would start watching a show , it would freeze and come on forty minutes later in the middle of another show. The only other problem we had were ants on the Lanai . The hotel came and took care of it . I loved looking at the mango tree outside the room so I left the ants alone and we didn’t hang out outside as much as I would have liked.  Even with a few blips this was still one of our best vacations. The Montage is stunningly beautiful. The staff was excellent and allowed us to relax while they took care of us.  And a special shout out: Aloha, This is the Montage, how can I help you? This is Ben.I called so many times to make sure everything was as planned and every time Ben assured me that I would be happy.

This is beautiful hotel for when you are traveling with a larger group or family. Our unit was very large and gave everyone the space that they needed. The pool was expansive and very nice- the pool staff were amazing. My only complaint is that this hotel is very quiet at night. If you are looking for a vibe or energy at night, this is not your place. I would say that this is your place if you want luxury but have kids or an extended family with you.

The spacious two bedroom suite is separated by a large living room, kitchen, laundry room and powder room. There was a huge balcony with a table and chairs and lounge chairs to look out at the gorgeous view of the resort pool and the ocean. They had every amenity in this unit from baking ware to bag clips. The food and drinks at the restaurants and poolside were delicious. The beach was not crowded and they had both pool toys and beach toys available to use for free. I don't think I have ever felt so welcomed at a hotel before. The valet staff are particularly friendly and very knowledgeable about what the island has to offer. We ventured out several times but nothing was better then relaxing at this resort.

Restaurants are expensive (expensive even for a resort) but the food is good (but not outstanding). Merriman's is right next door and a short walk along the beach, so try that at least once. Our dinner there cost less than our dinners at the resort and the food was great. There are other places nearby that are decent and reasonably priced.    The service is mostly great. All of the servers at the main pool are helpful and friendly. Housekeeping does a great job. The valet guy took us over to Sansei for dinner and told us to call when we wanted to be picked up. The whole island was having phone issues because of the fires in Maui, so the phones were not working when it was time to get picked up. Our driver came looking for us, left a message with the restaurant hostess and really tried to make sure we would have a ride back.    We played tennis at the Kapalua tennis center and it was great, but hot. Got a massage at the spa. Very nice.    My only real criticism is that they need to buy more lounge chairs and umbrellas for the pool and set them up in two rows.

690143169,50,Absolutely breathtaking wedding experience,"My husband Sam and I recently were married at the Montage Kapalua Bay. From the very beginning we knew we picked the perfect venue. Montage Kapalua Bay is the most incredible hotel I've been to, beating all other 5 star hotels. From the location, incredibly friendly and helpful staff, delicious food, infinity pools, rooms, etc., this resort blew us--and our guests--away. Ku'uipo Muscutt, the catering manager, made the wedding planning experience so enjoyable. Sam and I were nervous about wedding planning because neither of us have experience with event planning and the whole idea of planning such a major life event was overwhelming. Thankfully for us, Ku'uipo was there to save the day! We didn't have to worry about the stress of finding the perfect vendors and coordinating the little details--we told Ku'uipo what we wanted and she made it happen!  Our floral vendor, Maverick Events, exceeded our expectations with the incredible arrangements they custom created for our wedding. I found a picture online of my dream bridal bouquet, but I was concerned that it would be difficult to replicate because of how unique it was! Maverick Events made that dream bridal bouquet and made it event BETTER than the original!  Our photographer, Amity Mason Photography, is the most talented photographer I have come across. Amity somehow kept us relaxed and enjoying ourselves during pre-wedding pictures and kept that fun, light-hearted energy during our ceremony and bride & groom pictures. One of our favorite parts about our wedding was taking pictures with Amity because of how fun she is to be around. As for Amity's talent--the photos speak for themselves. Absolute perfection.  Our entertainment, Manutea Nui E, provided the most incredible fire knife show. It was the perfect transition from cocktail hour to the reception. Our fire knife dancer was so talented that people were watching off their room balconies!    Our wedding is going to be impossible to beat, thanks to the incredible Montage Kapalua Bay, Ku'uipo Muscutt, Amity Mason Photography, Maverick Events, and Manutea Nui E.

689322096,50,Five star resort with incredible landscaping and views,"Our party of six including my wife and two teenage children and my in-laws enjoyed a five-day stay at this beautiful corner of paradise. We stayed in a three-bedroom ocean view suite. The apartment is wonderfully decorated with a state-of-the-art kitchen and large lanai. It was great for preparing breakfast and family style dinners. The concierge service and housekeeping were five star all the way around. The resort sits on 20+ acres of oceanfront property. The grounds are absolutely breathtaking. The pools are terraced and featured waterfalls and secluded coves. Our teenage children enjoyed exploring the grounds. There is a pathway that allows access to the public beach. We were able to rent a two person canoe and paddle-boards. We were also able to rent some snorkeling gear and walk to a small secluded bay that was teaming with tropical fish. The concierge was also able to arrange for access to the Kapalua tennis club. It was hard to find fault with the resort, although the restaurant and dine-in menus are so pricey - even for this type of tony resort - that it almost encourages people to cook their own meals. Overall, this resort deserves it’s rating as a top 100 Global resort.",Jul 2019,July 2019,Traveled with family,,"Cincinnati, Ohio"

688489816,50,Truly feels like home - in the best sense of the word,"We traveled to the Montage in July 2019 with our three kids (10, 7, and almost 4). We have stayed in Wailea without kids three other times, but the Montage in Kapalua was a big draw because of the space it offered and the location which seemed so much more Hawaii to us than the big hotels in Wailea. I knew it would be special during our planning phase - when Camila Martin, one of the concierges, helped me to plan out some wonderful activities and meals for our family ahead of arrival (as a side note: our private boat charter with Kaha Loa that she found for us was incredible!). It became even more special once we arrived. First of all, our three bedroom garden residence was upgraded to a three bedroom grand residence with partial ocean views and it was HUGE and GORGEOUS. So much space for everyone to feel truly at home, a huge laundry room for the tons of laundry we do on vacation, beautiful kitchen, dining, two huge spaces on the lanai for relaxing, and more! Everyone immediately felt comfortable and at home.    But even better than the residence (if that's possible) is that each day, we came across the most wonderful staff - at the pool, restaurants, bell desk, valet, front desk, housekeeping, and of course Auntie Silla, the Cultural Ambassador, who engaged our kids right away and mesmerized them with stories and lessons about the ukulele, hula, lei making, and importantly the history and cultural connections of the islands. They were so excited to complete each of the parts of the Montage Merits and to have Silla help them along the way. The Montage Merits program, the Paintbox staff including Chelsea and Sherri who took us on hikes in the tidepools and coastal trail, the staff who organized fabulous activities on the 4th of July and throughout our time there, and of course the Cultural Ambassador programs with Silla are a terrific way to engage kids, get them learning in a place that no way feels like school, and get them to experience the best parts of Maui. I could go on and on. The staff all truly cared about making us feel at home and making sure we had the ""best day ever"" every single day.    What I want to make sure to write is that the Montage Kapalua truly feels like Hawaii. It is a bit of a drive from the airport, Paia, and of course Hana (we didn't even try that one), but as Ashleigh from Paintbox so perfectly commented, there is so much in the Montage's backyard (hikes, snorkeling, paddleboarding, tidepools, the coastal trail, Kapalua, Ironwoods, and Fleming beaches), that you can do so much right there.    Now if I can just figure out a way to get all of us back there as soon as possible :)",Jul 2019,July 2019,Traveled with family,"Building 5 was a great location not far from the pool, beach or spa.

The accommodations are unmatched by anything we’ve ever experienced at Four Seasons and that’s saying a lot.  The rooms are huge, gorgeous, comfortable, and fresh. The property is well manicured, uncrowded, and in a location only God could create.  Restaurants at the resort are better than others we tried, though there are some terrific ones nearby as well. Hideaway’s became our fast favorite, Taylor at the bar is sweet, talented, and a treat to talk to. We love the musicians, especially Kendall and Pinani. We met other couples and all had a blast, even did some sight seeing together.  Spa was nice but the ladies that checked us in for our services were not very helpful. The massages and facials were unbelievable, OM.    We jumped off the cliffs and swam with turtles, saw tons of fish and met some nice island folks.  Great hiking right from the hotel and close by.

684866952,50,Unbelievably relaxing,"This hotel has everything going for it. The location is very private but has great access to local restaurants, the town of Lahaina, golfing in the area, and walk to a great beach with snorkels and other water toys for rent to hotel guests. The gym is very good, but some of the equipment is a little dated and they are in desperate need of getting Pelotons, which they say they have ordered. The pool area is fantastic and very low density with plenty of chairs to go around. Unlike other hotels that are very crowded by the pool, I would say 50% of the chairs were empty each day even though the hotel was 100% occupied. They’ve done a nice job of spacing things out. Plus, with all of the hotel rooms being residences in nature, I think people spend more time in their rooms as a family whereas hotel guests would normally be scrambling to get out of their rooms to enjoy the common areas. Same with the restaurants where half of the tables were empty at each meal, yet the food was excellent on all fronts. We particularly found room service dining for both breakfast and dinner Exceptional. Service across all fronts was a 10, from the concierge, room service, valet service, pool service and housekeeping. The beds are super comfortable and the kitchen is very well appointed. The only two disappointments we had are the configuration of the room and the view. The dual master suite sets up well for two couples traveling together, and I guess if they have kids, those kids could share the third bedroom. But for a family, our 16-year-old daughter had the same bedroom, bathroom and closet space as my wife and me. Just seems to be a bit of a design flaw for families. The view was a little disappointing, particularly for the price. We expected a more significant Oceanview, but did have a lovely view of the pool area and gardens. However, what’s advertised as ocean views aren’t panoramic for the most part, and are just a slice on the horizon as shown below. You might consider checking on VRBO as the units in building one in building five are privately owned and available to rent directly from owners, and you can get better value there and the best views are in building number one. While you don’t get room service and have to pay for the gym and spa, you might just do your own price comparison as some of the private owner units are larger and more uniquely appointed as well.",Jun 2019,June 2019,Traveled with family,,"La Jolla, California"
684127489,50,Gorgeous Resort for an Amazing Intergenerational Vacation Experience!!,"My wife and I and our three girls ages 12,16, & 18 along with my mother, visited the Montage Kapalua Bay 6/8-6/15 2019 to celebrate our oldest daughter's 18th birthday, our middle daughter's 16th birthday, my wife's 50th and my mom's 80th birthday. We had done some research on the Montage Resort and accommodations prior to booking our reservation as we were looking for a Resort that offered accommodations that were spacious, private, and well equipped for a weeks stay. We ended up booking a Three-Bedroom Ocean View Room with a private Lanai. The setup of the room was absolutely perfect! My wife and I shared a room, the two older girls had their own bedroom, my mom had her own room, and our youngest daughter had the entire living room and pull out couch! There was a full kitchen, and washer and dryer. Montage is known for its stellar customer service and the Montage Kapalua Bay didn't disappoint! From the moment that we pulled into the Valet we were warmly greeted by Montage staff with Kukui nut and flower leis welcoming our Ohana (family) to the Montage and the island of Maui. Waiting for us in our room was a welcome poster and personalized note, birthday cards for the girls and my mom, a bottle of champagne and apple cider and some beautiful and amazing birthday deserts!! Our own personal concierge, Ayami Kanayama went out of her way to book us dinner reservations, and to offer helpful excursion and travel tips. All of the staff remembered us and called us by name. The Signature restaurant Cane & Canoe is fabulous (the scallops and Ahi Tartare are a must) and the service is impeccable. The pool servers and staff go well out of their way to make sure that you are well taken care of by setting up your lounge chairs, bringing you water, food, drinks, and anything else that you might need to enjoy a day enjoying the stunning view of the ocean, and the islands of Lanai and Molokai from the Infinity pool. The snorkeling at Kapalua Beach just a short walk from the pool is first rate with hundreds of beautifully colored fish and coral. Paddle boarding and kayaking is also offered. Our girls took full advantage of the myriad of daily activities offered by the Montage Resort such as Ukulele lessons, Lei making, and Hula lessons with Auntie Silla who taught our girls the culture, history, importance and significance of these activities and how they became part of and were incorporated into Hawaiian culture.  My wife and mother took full advantage of Spa Montage and enjoyed relaxing Lomi Lomi massages to destress and decompress from the demands of day to day life on the mainland.

We had a perfect arrival experience with exceptionally professional bell staff followed by a greeting by a personal concierge who provided cold towels and fresh fruit while they oriented you to the stunning property vistas from the open air arrival deck overlooking the tiered pool and ocean beyond. We loved that the check in process was not handled at the front desk but instead in our suite residence. We booked an amazing penthouse level one bedroom 1.5 bath residence with jaw dropping panoramic views from the spacious lanai area. We were very happy with our accommodations which included a full kitchen, laundry room, living room with sleeper sofa and a luxurious master suite. Everything was absolutely perfectly executed throughout the stay and the staff (each and every one of them) were absolutely extraordinary.. The training of the staff is clearly being exceptionally managed and implemented by management because the service was FLAWLESS. We booked a cabana prior to our arrival via the fantastic pre arrival concierge staff who also assisted us with our dining reservations and with managing some packages that we had delivered ahead of our arrival. Our cabana was perfectly perched overlooking the gorgeous pool with lush landscaping, mini waterfalls, hot tubs and lots of fun little areas to discover during a much needed pool/cabana relaxation day. The grounds are absolutely beautiful and we loved strolling along the coastal walk both day and night. Be sure to go out to the end where the benches are located at night for some extra special stargazing and shooting stars! We also chose Maui to take our helicopter tours from and are thrilled that we did. The tours are operated about a 45 minute drive away but WELL worth the drive so be sure to add a ""doors off"" cliffs and waterfalls experience to your visit to cap off your stay at this exceptional Resort...

676278861,40,Nice place,"I really love the beach walking path and think the gardens are well manicured. I also think housekeeping and maintenance do an excellent job maintaining the rooms.    I do believe this is probably the nicest resort in Maui. However, I feel Maui and this resort has become a bit commercialized. Corners are skilled and I can’t quite call it luxurious (when I think of a few places I’ve been to in Mexico and the Caribbean). The pools and beach get way too crowded. If you don’t have your chair picked out by 8:30/9, nothing is left. The beach gets SUPER crowded and the only think they do for you is give you a few towels and beat up lounge chairs. Waiters and towel setter uppers at the pool come by infrequently at best. Turndown service is basically a towel removal with a few candies left on the bed.    After being at places where turn down included gifts and handwritten notes or places where you got your sunglasses cleaned on a very private and quite beach, perhaps I’m just spoiled. I just feel to pay over 1400 a night and fight for lounge chairs at a pool or beach is beyond insanity. Go to Mexico and get a private villa for 600 where you get a butler and private beach.",May 2019,May 2019,,,los angeles
673849809,50,One of the best properties on Maui,"My family and I have visited Maui many times. Montage Kapalua Bay may very well be our favorite property.    The location is great- a little isolated, but in a good way. Far enough away from Lahaina and Kaanapali that you don’t get crowds, but close enough if you want to drive down there for the night. The property is on Kapalua Bay, which is one of Maui’s best beaches. There are also some really cool rock formations and tide pools to explore.    We stayed in a 3 bedroom condo. The unit was amazing. Spacious, but not overwhelming. Full kitchen, living rooms, dining room, and laundry room. Newer construction and modern amenities. We had a personal concierge, but we didn’t need them for much.    The pools were nice. Busy, but not too busy. The kids found other kids to play with, but there weren’t too many children running around. Just enough kids- in a good way. The pool service was good. Chairs and cabanas filled up, but the staff was always able to find a place for us with shade.    The main restaurant was good. A little overpriced, but that was totally expected. We actually thought the food from the bar/ casual restaurant by the main pool was better. Not as fancy, but solid burgers, etc. Honestly, I would just go to some of the restaurants in town or in Lahaina for dinner. Mostly for a change of scenery.

The service and staff are amazing individuals. We have made friends with all the pool staff that stop by for a moment or stay for the whole day. They make it feel as though you are apart of the Montage Family.    On the other hand, the beach staff are stuck up on their high horse ruining the chance to enjoy all of paradise. Their rude remarks and lack of care for the hotel guests is truly disappointing considering everything else the resort offers.

The pool was NEVER crowded, however I feel this has a lot to do with the timing of our trip in late April. Food was decent and what you'd expect poolside. Cocktails a little steep, but if you have a villa with a kitchen, this doesn't factor much.  There are not enough good things we could all say about this place. And those who have left negative reviews, must have ridiculous and outlandish expectations. You will not be disappointed in this resort and we cannot wait to go back!    Tips:  *Building 1 has the best views & a huge grassy area +++  *Kapalua beach is great for snorkeling but is tiny and therefore fairly crowded, its worth the 10 minute walk to Namalu Bay you're looking to sunbathe, boogie board, etc.  *Valet has a TON of beach items other families have left behind (chairs, boogie boards, sand toys, umbrellas, etc) so don't buy any!  *Take advantage of the complimentary experiences and demos the hotel offers each day.

668974446,30,Questionable value,"For the price you pay at this hotel, compared to comparable hotels elsewhere in the world, there are a number of areas in which this hotel could improve. It has a beautiful tiered pool area with views of the ocean but very little shade. The day beds that they charge a premium daily rate for have shade, but the rest of the chairs are mostly in the sun. The scattered few available have usually been reserved by someone early in the morning by putting towels on their chairs while they spend hours having breakfast/ sleeping in until they actually appear to use it. The first day we arrived, we tried to put some lounges in the shade of a tree. No one came to help us move these lounges. Instead they started packing up lounges by piling them up in front of us to obscure our view of the kids in the pool. We had the impression we’d arrived at a 3 star property at this point.    Housekeeping didn’t come until very late in the day. Apparently they offer a turndown service but by the time housekeeping comes at 5pm, it seems hardly worth it. We did manage to get turndown one night which only involved getting some coconut lollies left on the pillow, that was it in its entirety.    The resort fee costs $48 a day, plus $35/ day for parking and by the time you tip the valet each time you want the car, it adds up! The resort fee seems excessive given there is minimal poolside service, usually we were helping ourselves to towels and many times couldn’t access a lounge with any shade. No one comes to bring you water or anything. Maybe you get that if you hire a daybed for the day? All the activities at the beach you had to pay for separately as well ie paddle boards, snorkels etc.    The room was beautiful and well set up for our needs. However we had an equivalent room at the Hyatt Residence Club Kaanapali Beach last visit at a fraction of the price. We don’t feel the extra money paid at this resort was worth it. Camila at the concierge desk was extremely helpful prior to our visit in arranging activities so she certainly made a good impression prior to our arrival.

With the two of us living in Chicago and planning our wedding in Maui (which neither of us have ever been to) was definitely a bit nerve racking. Thankfully, we had the most amazing, organized, experienced event coordinator, Ku’uipo. Ku’uipo was the greatest asset of the entire wedding package. She consistently reached out to us and kept in touch with us leading up to the wedding. She made sure that we were always on track with where we needed to be with planning. She asked us specific questions about important details that we would have never even thought about. She worked within our budget to recommend the best vendors, and then did all the communicating and planning with vendors while acting as the liaison between us. Ku’uipo and the entire Montage staff are so extremely organized. They had layouts for floor plans that we were able to work with to decide on the setup of the reception and ceremony. They provided us with a very descriptive banquet order prior to the even that broke down the costs of everything including the costs of all the outside vendor services (ie. Photography, DJ, Floral, etc.) so we had an idea of the final cost of everything leading up to the wedding. We could go on and on about how smooth they made this planning process for us, and we are pleased that the day of the wedding was no different!    Ku’uipo and Juan, the banquet captain of our wedding, ensured that our wedding day went amazing. We had so many compliments from our guests/bridal party on how helpful and on top of things they were. Everything was in place just as we had planned it and it all came together so beautifully. The entire staff that worked with us that night were all so warm and friendly and we are beyond thankful for them for making our wedding day perfect. We could go on and on about how everything was literally organized perfectly and amazing for our day! To give some examples and we credit this fully to Ku’uipo and Juan, the cocktail hour, the pictures, the reception was so well organized and planned out in regards to timing that it made us feel so relaxed!!

The beach was beautiful but the pool was even better. Paintbox was a big winner and the merit badges were a hit too, loved learning and playing at the same time.    Incredible rooms, a home really, just huge. The kids felt like royalty with so much space and privacy. We looked right out at a perfect sunset every night we were “home”.  Housekeepers were the best!    We hit Hideaway the first night and slept late the next morning. Food was super good for dinner and room service breakfast. The staff are just so friendly and made us feel special at every turn.    Day two was for exploration, sunrise at Haleakala was spectacular and a lifelong dream. We packed breakfast then ate at Leoda’s in the way home, delicious.    Day three, WHALES, we saw so many including several babies. Trilogy crew were really nice and we have sooooo many photos. Dinner at Hula Grill, very busy but a great time had by all.    Day four was another rest day, more pool and paintbox time, loved it.  Cane Canoe for dinner, probably the best meal of the whole vacation.    Parents night out for day five, babysitter earned every penny. Lahaina Grill, tucked away and cozy, a very good meal. Went to a Gelato place afterwards, mango sorbet hit the spot after a filling dinner and a good amount of wine.    Beach day, snorkeling and paddle boarding. Too much sun but worth it. Went to the pool to eat and have a few drinks, what a nice way to live :)    Yes, Montage and Maui were Wonderful.    We will return.",Mar 2019,March 2019,Traveled with family,,"Seattle, Washington"
662479781,50,Resort review.,"A 5 star plus property. Staff is first class; pool, according to a Four Seasons exec who I know, is the best in Hawaii. Not inexpensive.... but for that special experience in Maui you can’t do better... by a long shot.",Mar 2019,March 2019,Traveled with family,,
661524363,10,Overrated. Overpriced.,"Went here for my honeymoon. It was awful and we’re never going back.    When we stayed here, management shutdown the whole resort for a day or two due to a hurricane. Sure that’s understandable, but then billing us the full rate when the resort wasn’t even staffed.... pretty low move in my opinion.    We were paying top dollar, and expected top service- but clearly management just wants your money and could care less about you.    Want a nice place to sit by the pool? That’ll cost you an extra $200-$1000 per day!    Want a decent breakfast? It’ll cost you over $100 per day for two.    Want room service? Everything is marked up even more on the in-room dining menu. Plus there’s a delivery fee. Plus there’s a service charge. Plus they still ask for an additional tip. A very sad looking couple entrees with sides cost us $200+.    Want to park you car? That’s $40 per day and the valet guys expect tips from you too!    Furthermore, there wasn’t much to do near the hotel so you need to uber or drive everywhere.    Lastly, I will admit, the room itself was great, and the place is noticeably less crowded than more mainstream hotels.  However, the total room cost, plus the insane nickel and diming / cash grabs, just aren’t worth it.",Mar 2019,August 2018,Traveled as a couple,,"Stowe, Vermont"

Cane and Canoe restaurant is acceptable but not great. Food was good but service could be better. Everyone very nice, just a bit slow. Pool gets very crowded quickly. I am certain spring break contributed. This is not your resort if you are bothered by lots of kids. This is a place that welcomes young family’s.

658553585,50,"The perfect choice for a luxurious, relaxing family vacation","We came here on a vacation with our one-year-old and it was absolutely perfect. We had a one bedroom garden view. I didn't regret not upgrading to an ocean view as we were surrounded by beautiful landscaping and could walk right out to the pool, restaurant, etc. which was convenient with a baby. It was so relaxing hanging out on the lanai at night, listening to the music playing from the restaurant. The living space is massive and beautiful. I loved that we had a kitchen - it really made the cost of the resort more manageable because we could dine in or have drinks on the lanai.    The grounds were great. The pools were never crowded and the views were stunning. There were fun outdoor games like bean bags and connect four to play. It was kid friendly but never felt overrun by kids. We took advantage of the complimentary photography session and love that we now have family photos to remember this great experience.    The service was also a step above anywhere I have been. They went as far as giving our daughter a choice of stuffed animal when we arrived and leaving us with Montage hats in our car after check-out. They even happily unloaded our stuff from Costco into the kitchen when we arrived. I never felt bothered, yet whenever we needed something, they were quick to respond.    The only downsides to staying here are that it is in a bit of a remote spot of the island. I actually didn't mind this as most of our time was spent at the resort. We were also able to walk to Merriman's which I loved. We did have breakfast at the resort restaurant which I admit was mediocre and overpriced - maybe their dinner is better? The weather seemed to be not as good as south side of the island. It was overcast and windy a few days we were there. I also thought it was a bit petty they didn't included things like snorkling gear and fitness class in with the resort fee like other resorts typically do. And of course the price to stay here is steep.    All that being said, I would recommend this resort to any family that can find it within their budget. It is certainly worth the splurge, especially considering the price of other resorts on the island that aren't nearly as nice. We walked over to the Ritz Carlton nearby for lunch and the Montage truly seemed like it was in a different league.

James our server was amazing and had only been there a few months and he was on it. Great menu, and great atmosphere. I would compare it to the other restaurant at montage, Cane and Canoe is horrific and has such a great location, but the food and service stinks.

654568237,50,Spectacular location in a less touristy and crowded area,"We had an amazing large unit facing the ocean, great setting for a group of friends. We looked the unit directly with the owner through VRBO. We didn’t have any meals there but spent quite a bit of time at the wonderful small beach right there and by the pools. The charge for the beach umbrellas is ludicrous $40 for 2 hours, and sometimes it is hard to find a chair by the pool. The two infinity pools should be in the quiet zone but it isn’t enforced at all, kids playing there or in the hot tub. The property is impeccably maintained and the service very friendly. The check in was VIP level for us however our friends who arrived 2 hours later where essentially sent to our unit without a key and minimal instructions, big contrast, and had to call us in order to get them by elevator which is controlled by unit key. Despite some of these misses in service we still give the property a 5 for its unique location and very close to several good restaurants, a layout that never makes it feel crowded. Our unit was exceptional on the top floor by the water and we spent much of the time on the large wonderful balcony, watching whales close to the shore, spectacular sunsets and relaxing.",Feb 2019,January 2019,Traveled with friends,I cant imagine not having the ocean view....other side is golf/resort type view.,"Boston, Massachusetts"

Breakfast buffet is sparse and set up on top of the tables nearby. Pool staff seemed nonexistent until around 11am. Sometimes we’d get checked on 3 times in an hour other times no one could be found. I’d expect a Montage to train their employees better than this.    Concierge was top notch however. Also really appreciated the enthusiasm of our porter and check in rep. Concierge organized a lovely dinner in our residence. Housekeeping kept good timing. Gorgeous view of the ocean. Saw quite a few whales this time of year.

650794498,40,Lovely - But Not Without a Few Glitches,"This is our second time staying at the Montage, in a similar sized suite. It truly is a luxurious, spacious, well-equipped residence. But we noticed a few things that stand out at this luxury property. We had asked for an early check-in. Regular check-in is 1600. We arrived at 1330 and were told our room was in the ""inspection stage"" so it shouldn't be long. We went to a pool front bar. By 1500 we had heard nothing (despite a promise by the concierge that we would), so we went back to the front to enquire. We were told our room was in the process of being cleaned and we'd be in by 1600. We expressed our displeasure at the poor communication and asked to to notified ASAP when the room was ready. We got a call 5 minutes later saying it was....that seemed very strange to go from being ready in an hour to ready in five minutes.    The concierge who checked us in was the only employee in a staff of very lovely, friendly helpful folks who rubbed us the wrong way. Just because it's an expensive property does mean we want to get fawned over and spoken to in a fake, ingratiating tone of voice. He came across as phoney and completely insincere. Aside from the sketchy check-in process we had a phone call the next night saying someone was at our door with our cream we had ordered. We said we hadn't ordered any cream and the person on the phone questioned me a bit. About five minutes later the door-bell rang but no one was there. A few nights later we had a hang up phone call. These aren't huge deals, but at 1500$ a night, not what you expect.    And we didn't appreciate the hidden resort fees and parking fees that add up to nearly $100 dollars per night. AND you don't have a choice but to valet park.    One other thing to note is a luxury property of this size, not having a coffee shop or a little grab and go market. You can get a coffee in the TINY gift shop. I'm surprised there's not a shop to pick up supplies you might need for a picnic lunch out or a few groceries for the room. Huge hole in this property.    But on the plus side, the beds and variety of pillows are VERY comfortable, the kitchen in very well stocked, the living room and dining area are comfortable and very well laid out. One of the valets ""Rob"" is very friendly and welcoming and so is the lady who lives in Kula who works at the valet desk. The fellow from Texas who works in the Hide-Away bar seemed real and friendly. And the girl who worked in the gift shop whose husband worked downstairs in the restaurant was VERY helpful.    The adults only pool and hot-tub area is a big bonus. We were very comfortable here, and for the most part it is luxurious.

My husband and I arrived two days prior to our arrival at the Residence Inn in Wailea to adjust to 5 hr time difference from east coast mainland and wait for the other 3 in our party to arrive from LA. We had excellent experience at Residence Inn, toured the area and checked out the Four Seasons, Wailea, as we considered that an option for our additional 6 day stay. Lovely property but felt much was crammed in to the beautiful space. Once we saw the expansiveness of Montage it amplified our sentiments. Point of reference if you are considering the Ritz, Kapalua, it too is a lovely property but main building where we had a drink is need of refreshing - lobby is dark, furnishings tired, painting peeling on the bathroom walls. Talked to several staff and they were very cordial. Can't speak to the individual rooms. To the original purpose of this review...the fabulous Montage Kapalua Bay. For 50 years husband and I have traveled for pleasure (Caribbean, Europe, Scandinavia, Hong Kong and throughout the USA). Our stay at the Montage now ranks as our favorite staff and facility. We stayed in building 1 with breathtaking views. The 4 bedroom residence worked perfectly for us. All of our party enjoys cooking so we ate half of our dinners ""at home"" (and a fabulous home it was) - the kitchen was very well equipped and served our needs nicely. From the moment we exited our car the entire staff was warm, welcoming, professional and at the ready to help make our stay the delight it was. Our high regard for the Montage Kapalua began months before our visit when our extraordinary personal concierge, Camilla, contacted me. Through emails and phone calls she crafted an itinerary of activities and dinner reservations that captured all that we wanted for our stay; we were thrilled with it all. Camilla is extremely knowledgeable, engaging and flexible when we needed to adapt our schedule. She beautifully represents the high quality this brand is known for with her well-honed professional skills and endearing personality. I attended one of the many cultural offerings on site. The lei making class with Silla is an experience that I will long remember and be grateful for as Silla shared her skills and reverence for her heritage. I wish that I was able to attend more of the sessions. Our overall impression of the Montage at Kapalua is a place of peace and tranquility...it begins with the entrance to the building at the most understated check-in on the planet. The pools and spa are lovely...super massages for two in our group. We were told by one of the property engineers that the Montage Kapalua is the only property on the island to heat their pools. Since we were there in January it was much appreciated.

646115698,20,"Don't count on service, check your bill, don't count on peace and quiet","We spent the New Year's holiday at the Montage Kapalua Bay for 9 nights. Before we arrived, we requested a quiet room. We like to sleep late on vacation. On three different occasions we requested buildings 1,2 or 5 as they are the quietest. Each time we were assured we'd get into one of those buildings if it was available. The night before arrival, I called to see what assignment we got, - it was building 4. I asked what happened, were the other buildings full? The answer was there were many openings in the buildings we wanted, as long as we paid an additional $2500/night! I asked why this issue wasn't disclosed the prior 3 times we were on the phone (we would have booked elsewhere had we known the true cost for quiet rooms). They had no answer and they didn't care about the documented deception (American Express recorded the calls).    Sure enough, about half way through our stay, we were awoken at 9am by amplified hula music outside of our room. I called the front desk to inquire, and was told it was ""my bad luck"" the music woke us up. I asked to speak t the manager. After ducking my calls for days, Mr Holtzman reiterated the hotel's position that playing loud music outside of guest's rooms at 9am was ""no problem"" for guests. It's fair to say we disagreed. Hotel management is great ""apologizing"" but useless at resolving issues.    To give you some sense of how bad routine service was, nearly every day the housekeepers would ask if we ""really wanted our room cleaned"". Unbelievable!    Flash forward to the second to last day of our stay. We met some people at a restaurant in town at dinner and got to discussing the Montage's issues. It turned out one of the folks we were speaking with was a concierge on the island. She laughed and said the Montage was known to have the worst service on Maui. She said she knew of a number of families that left mid-stay and went to another hotel. I know we would have moved if we weren't a large family (4 kids).    On check out, there were 27 incorrect charges on our bill. All were removed once I flagged the errors, but be sure to check your bill!    We travel a lot. We've stayed in many, many hotels in Hawaii. The Montage is by far the worst experience we've ever had. Do yourselves a favor and try the Four Seasons Hualalai or Maui, Mauna Kea, Mauni Lani (when it reopens), or even the Fairmont.

641415358,50,Five Star Residence Experience in West Maui,"We frequent Maui often, typically 2-3 times per year staying in our Hyatt Residence with a few added hotel days sampling 5 star properties, mostly selecting the Four Seasons Wailea. This December we traveled with our two teenage daughters and decided to sample in West Maui and try the Montage at Kapalua Bay. And boy, are we glad we did! If you have done any reviews of this property, it's obvious to say the Montage photographs well, but close up, it's even more gorgeous! And, we will definitely be returning on future visits.    Check-in is very welcoming as we were kindly greeted in the lobby area by our smiling and gracious host and concierge. There was not one minute in front of a typical hotel podium separating guest from front-desk check in. The Montage personalized check-in experience reminded me of the check-in and personal greeting experience at the Four Seasons Hualalai and Lanai. A nice touch Montage!    Our host quickly led us to our 'residence' and made sure we were happy with the unit while showing us around. I'm famous for requesting room changes and not accepting the first option, but my family was very pleased to know they would not need to change rooms at the Montage. Wow, not only are the residences roomy, they are tastefully decorated with a modern, yet island feel and there is just a feeling of quality throughout. Some Hawaiian properties get a little too tiki-tacky, even the nice ones...The decor in the Montage residences exudes transitional five-star Southern Californian. Tall ceilings, expansive bathrooms, beefy shaker style finish out, walk-in closets and high-end appliances with a sub-zero fridge and a wolf cook top and oven. This is truly a residence versus a posh hotel room.    Our garden view lanai was very large and we did have a slight peek of the ocean through lush landscaping. The only thing we could possibly complain about was the patio furnishings. Aside from the comfy lounge bed, the dining and chaise loungers just did not match the quality of the residence, nor the resort. These furnishings looked like common patio furniture purchased at any big box hardware store. Brown Jordan furnishings would really be more fitting for a property of this level. And, would match the pool furnishings and lounge beds.    The Montage is located on the former and somewhat historic, Kapalua Bay Hotel property. I had the pleasure of visiting the old classic prior to demolition so I was familiar with the grounds and how stunning the actual property is in this part of Kapalua. Views of Lanai and Molokai are in the distance behind the blue ocean palette, healthy green lawns bordered by lava outcroppings extending into the waves. There is nothing more 'Hawaii' than this property and landscape. While the old hotel is missed, the Montage quickly honors the classic by providing an entirely new experience on the already stunning grounds. Well done!    The pools are so varied you can literally pick a different pool experience for each day. Whether you choose the spa pool, the sunset pool or the main pools, there will be one that fits your mood of the day and seating is never a problem. This is not a mega-hotel where you must state your claim to pool real estate early in the morning. The Montage has 70 units shared with residence owners, so there is ample room and plenty of really comfy padded pool seating. We enjoyed the serenity pool which was complemented by the awesome and friendly pool attendants and staff. Service, amazing!    Cane and Canoe is the main restaurant on property for breakfast and dinner and we had several meals, each equally delicious leaving nothing to complain about. Nothing! The steaks are amazing and do not leave without trying the omelette and indulgent cinnamon roll. Pool fare was great too! My repeat meal was the kale Greek salad because it was so good.    The Spa Montage is one of the nicest facilities we've experienced on the islands. The large space leaves plenty of room for your expected weight room and area for classes. The separated men and women wet areas are extraordinary, well stocked with all the necessities to make for a relaxing steam, sauna, hot tub, cold splash and shower ritual after a good workout. We enjoyed the facility each day of our stay and I ended with a treatment, which was a nice way to end the stay at Montage. Having visited the men's area several times, it was clear the staff attending to things could use some management. The areas were not well-maintained, often had previous users towels laying around and in the showers. The towels and wash cloths were not stocked well and the wet areas just felt like they needed a good power washing or some updating. -I think Montage should tighten this up a bit because it detracts from the overall five-star experience. Did this inhibit any enjoyment? Not really.    The way we are treated during our visits to properties while on vacation largely shapes our overall experience at a resort like this. We cannot say enough about the warm, hospitable service that permeates all staff on property. From the front of house valet to the housekeepers and everyone in between...Guests are made to really feel like guests in someones home....A really nice home!    If you are considering a splurge on Maui, and Montage assuredly is a splurge, we strongly recommend this property. So, what is different about this five star versus others on the island you might ask? Well, a lot. This is not a crowded hotel. Rather, it's a residential property with low people density with all of the ingredients of a top property. If you require busy bars and restaurants, more hotel action, activities, close proximity to shopping, then perhaps some other properties might suit you better in Wailea. Kapalua has been accused of being a tad sleepy, but we like this. For us, the Montage was arguably one of the best properties we have been in all of Hawaii and if I haven't said this before, I'll say it again....we cannot wait for our return visit!    We would like to thank the entire staff at Montage for making our short visit memorable and a true pleasure.",Dec 2018,December 2018,Traveled with family,,Austin

638823208,50,Excellence at its finest,"Our family recently returned from another amazing stay at the beautiful Montage Kapalua Bay.  This place is just outstanding in every way. The level of service you receive is next to none, and each and every staff member goes above and beyond to make you feel like royalty.  The property is kept up impeccably, with every attention to detail taken care of. The rooms and suites are spotlessly clean, and I always notice when staying here this is one of the few places I’ve stayed where the housekeeping service does NOT taper off throughout your stay.  The private room elevators and entrances really make you feel relaxed and like your living in your own house, plus it’s nice to able to leave beach toys etc outside the front door and they remained untouched and undisturbed. Our son left his scooter outside the front door just like home! The pools here are something else, so many different little areas with waterfalls and neat spots to swim on top of the main pools, all connected in a myriad of ways, always keeps it fun and interesting to go for a refreshing swim.  And they are SPOTLESS. ALWAYS. I’m extremely discerning when it comes to swimming pools and the Montage has nailed it. You can tell they take extreme care in making sure the pools are vacuumed daily and they have a rigorous program in place to keep it immaculate.  We also love the in house photography service. Pacific Dream Photograhy. This was the second year in a row we purchased the family photo shoot and both times our pictures turned out GREAT! Tiffany does such a beautiful job, she is professional but still makes it easy and fun!  It’s a real highlight of the trip AND we have spectacular family photos to bring home!  The Montage surprised our daughter on arrival with the most extravagant dessert/candy tray for her 13th birthday, she is still talking about it!!  My husband and I as well as our kids love Henry at the pool bar and he is one of the best bartenders we’ve ever encountered in our travels. Friendly, professional AND so good at his job, concocting delicious cocktails with grace and style, all filled with his amazing Aloha spirit.

638477554,50,Wow!!!,"Of all of the places my wife and I have traveled, this has to be one of the best places we have had the pleasure of temporarily residing. From the moment we arrived until the time we sadley departed the service and attention to detail were second to none. I have never experienced so much sincere caring from a hotel staff in my life. Everyone on staff was just so intent on making our stay a beautiful memory. A special shout out to Kiha and Brandon who made us feel like family. They were interested in learning about us and went out of their way to give us many insider tips about Maui. Kiha, an accomplished artist as it turns out, surprised me with a beautiful painting on the day we departed show casing our Georgia Bulldogs football teams Logo surrounded by accident Hawaiian tribal tattoo designs. To say I was surprised is an understatement. Words cannot describe our short stay at the Montage but I can assure you we will be back really soon. Our plan is to seek information about the fractional ownership of the resort so that our entire family can experience the resort for years to come.

We have been fortunate to visit Kapalua many times, and can say from experience that your enthusiasm sharing your ocean and marine life knowledge, and water sports skill made for a wonderful aloha spirit at the beach. While we were enjoying relaxing by Kapalua Bay, we came to appreciate your excellent work helping keep all (from people to turtles) safe, from cautions about currents to be aware of snorkeling, to cautions about not touching turtles (to avoid spreading harmful bacteria to and from them) and how turtles need adequate space to feed and rest.

636378173,50,maui luxury at its best,"when we first booked at Montage Kapalua, we weren't sure about being so far away from everything but once we arrived and checked into our gorgeous spacious suite which felt more like a luxury condo villa with a separate bedroom, giant bathroom, gourmet kitchen, huge living room and an enormous patio thats larger than most hotel rooms, we knew we'd made the right choice. It was our anniversary trip and they welcomed us with a beautiful floral towel arrangement and a bottle of champagne which was a very nice gesture. We loved the multi level pool area which was never crowded during our stay and we enjoyed the easily walkable and swimmable beaches near the property even more- Kapalua beach which is to the left is pretty famous and gets crowded during the day but not in the early morning or the late afternoon and we even spotted a giant sea turtle up close and personal. Namalu bay beach to the right has rougher surf but is far less crowded and was great for body boarding. We hiked around the nature reserve and cliffs where there was a ladder down to the water so you can swim in the little bay or jump off the rocks for the brave ones. We walked over to the Ritz once for brunch and the buffet was nice but the whole place seemed so much more crowded than the Montage. There's a Hanaloa store a little past the Ritz where you can get everything you need including toiletries, snacks and food, drinks and souvenirs. We enjoyed the restaurants on the Montage property and on our last night walked under the full moon along the beach to Merriman's where we enjoyed dinner with live jazz.

Adult pool very nice, staff was great. Good pool cocktails and snacks.",Nov 2018,November 2018,,,"Lafayette, United States"
635891085,40,"Lovely place, but food doesn’t measure up","First, the hotel is beautifully sited, set on a small gorgeous bay full of tropical fish and green turtles. It’s a collection of 4 & 5 story buildings mostly comprised of 1, 2 & 3 bedroom privately owned residences rented and managed by the Montage. There are also 50 hotel rooms owned by the Montage.    There are a few pools, with one designated “serenity” for adults only. Unfortunately - and this is surprising - there is no lap pool here, nor do any of the pools lend themselves to actual swimming. As a swimmer, I had no choice but to swim laps in the bay, which worked for me but might not be acceptible to others. Speaking of exercise, there is a small but adequate fitness room in the spa building with various machines, treadmills, ellipticals, free weights, balls, etc but it felt quite cramped. The spa is nice, but they were doing some construction during our Thanksgiving week visit, so hours were somewhat limited. They offer classes for guests - for ex. spin, yoga (Ana is great and the sunrise yoga outside was excellent), yogalates at the bargain price of $15 per class. Spa services, however, are very pricy, with an hour massage costing ——-, and 1 1/2 hr massage at $305. Also, they have an annoying policy of automatically tacking on a 20% service charge. I did have two massages during my stay and both masseuses were very good, with Melissa being exceptional. I opted to have both in outdoor “hales” rather than inside in the building, and that was nice, though once my serenity was interrupted by a boisterous group taking family photos. Why the hotel would situate these little pavillions on travelled paths rather than in private areas doesn’t make sense.    Our accommodations were lovely, with beautiful ocean views. We had two three bedroom units (one above the other), with full kitchens, laundry rooms, living and dining rooms, three full baths and a powder room, and expansive furnished lanais (decks) that extend the length of the master bedroom, living room and kitchen. Lanais also have gas barbeques. Both units are tastefully decorated, beds were comfortable, towels, linens, pillows, toiletries all of good quality. The kitchens are fully outfitted for cooking with pots, pans, dishes, flatware and glasses, allowing us prepare a family dinner and to feed our resident babies as needed. Had we known that the hotel food was only mediocre, we might have chosen to cook more than once.    On the topic of food, this hotel is sadly lacking. First of all, there is no breakfast buffet, which was very disappointing. There is one restaurant on property (Cane and Canoe - reviewed separately), and it was just ok. The restaurant serves breakfast and there is room service, so we chose to have breakfast delivered every day and ate outside on our lanais overlooking the ocean. Food quality was fine, but options were limited and they had no fresh juices at all. Because of our Virtuoso amenities, we received a breakfast allowance of $60/bedroom ($180) per day; nevertheless, we would have preferred a buffet. Most days, room service took over an hour to be delivered. The In-room menu options for dinner are limited and unfortunately the food was not very good. We did this only on our first night and never again. The only bright spot in food here is poolside lunch service.    Since I am very concerned about sustainability, I judge properties on this measure. I would rate the Montage “poor.” Despite the fact that both of our units have Sub-Zero refrigerators with filtered water and ice available in the door, we were not encouraged to use it and instead were given a continuous supply of single use plastic bottles of water. Upon my request, Housekeeping supplied a small recycling bin, but there is little effort to encourage conservation at the resort. There are no signs or messages to guests on this topic in residences. There is a dirth of trash cans on property and no recycling bins visible either, though hopefully staff separates materials elsewhere.    Hotel employees were pleasant and accommodating. Service was good, but not exceptional. Grounds were well-maintained, but not immaculate.    The beach is small and was uncrowded when we were there. Its location on a fairly calm bay full of a large variety of tropical fish makes it somewhat exceptional for Hawaii (in my experience). The hotel has a stand that rents an array of water toys (snorkels, masks, fins, boogie boards, stand up paddleboards), as well as beach chairs and umbrellas. Also available on property are volleyball, table tennis, and other games. Pools have toys for kids to use, as well. They also offer activities such as palm frond weaving, and other traditional Hawaiian crafts.    In sum, this is a lovely property in a great location. Not inexpensive, Montage Kapalua offers excellent accommodations in a beautiful setting. It is unfortunate that the food doesn’t measure up.",Nov 2018,November 2018,Traveled with family,,"La Jolla, California"

There are a few pools around property and one is open 24 hours. All of the staff members were really helpful and friendly...of course.    There is a convenient store on the resort. There is also a larger supermarket located in a shopping center less than 10 minutes away.    Overall, this was a very peaceful and modern place to stay.

The service and amenities at the Montage are beyond compare. Highly recommend booking one of the three bedroom grand residences in buildings 1 or 5. Sure $2000 a night might seem like a lot. But when you consider the amenities onsite as well as the ability to sleep 6 people per villa, it’s really quite affordable. The pools and spa are simply epic. Walking distance to Kapalua Bay and Merriman’s Kapalua for dinner. The Ritz is ok don’t get me wrong. But if you’re looking for the best, treat yourself and book Montage.

629511441,50,Fabulous resort! You won't be disappointed!,"We decided to splurge with a trip to Maui for our 25th wedding anniversary. We went through Costco Travel (and saved quite a bit of money) and chose the Montage for its combination of luxury and value (when we compared it to luxury resorts in the southern part of the island). I know that it probably seems ironic to use the word ""value"" with a resort that is pretty expensive, but we felt like we got a lot of bang for our buck at the Montage.    First of all, the staff is amazing! Every single person we encountered in our our 8 night stay was friendly, happy and seemed to enjoy their job! Everyone wanted to share their knowledge of the resort and of the island with us. We felt pampered and special and it seemed like the other guests were enjoying themselves, too.    The beauty of the resort is just jaw-dropping. We checked in around 6:30 p.m. and the view as you enter the open-air lobby is palm trees, sky and ocean. Breathtakingly beautiful. The landscaping and ocean views are just stunning.    We loved the quick and easy walk to the beach. We rented snorkel equipment and had a great time snorkeling around the bay. If you like some shade while ocean-side, there's a tree that provides a lot of shade while you're still oh-so-close to the ocean. I'm not a bake in the sun person, so the breezy shade was very nice. Umbrellas are available too in case the shady spot's already been claimed.    Pool-side was wonderful as well. The Montage has so many great pools to explore...you'll find waterfalls, little hidden spots, views of the ocean and views of the beautiful landscaping. Going to the pool was always a treat. There were also many pool attendants around to help find empty chairs, bring towels and glasses of cold water. Staff members would periodically walk around and offer little snacks of macadamia nuts, frozen grapes, mixed berries or gummy bears...what fun, unexpected treats!    Our unit was fabulous as well. We had a one bedroom premium ocean-view unit. Since we stayed 8 nights it was great to have so much room (including the extra 1/2 bath and the washer and dryer that was already stocked with Tide and Bounce sheets). The design of the units is tower-style so that when you take the elevator, it opens right up in front of your room! The housekeeping staff were like silent ninjas...we never heard them or saw them, but our unit was somehow always cleaned while we were away. The view from our unit was wonderful (I'm running out of adjectives to describe the beauty of the resort!).    For us, this resort was a splurge. We tried not to think too much about the cost of the $20 pool-side cocktails, but enjoyed our time together in this tropical paradise. Hopefully, we will stay here again, but if we don't, we know that we had a superb experience. We have nothing but fantastic memories of the Maui Montage resort.",Oct 2018,October 2018,Traveled as a couple,,
629156659,30,Disappointing for couples,"I was hoping a 4 figure a night beautiful suite would mean what everyone wants on a couple vacation. If you think you’ve left the kids and grandkids behind for a few days you haven’t. The problem is mostly in the mornings and later evenings when the children are allowed to play, scream and fight on the beautiful and large balconies. The design of the buildings around the center pool grounds is such that the noise is captured from wherever it comes. I understand and expect children playing in the pool. Fun! There is an adult pool for those who wish more quiet. But parents allowing children to disturb other guests in the peaceful mornings and evenings I just don’t understand. This morning I got up early made coffee and opened the balcony door at 6:45 and sure enough a family of rowdy kids are in the pool with the noise permeating the peaceful morning. And my building is the furthest back in the semi circle. Solution? Not sure there is one except for the pool hours but the balcony issue? That falls to the parents.    I haven’t found an adult only resort on the islands that I like yet but will keep looking.

The homes here are beautiful and leave nothing left to desire. There are games and books in the room in case you want to just sit and veg. The view is absolutely beautiful.

Gorgeous suite w full kitchen, fabulous bathrooms, comfortable linens & beds, great AC, over 1200 sqft of space for our family of 4. Garden view was great for easy access to pool. We wanted for NOTHING on this trip! Seriously. The staff steal the show at the resort. They knew who we were, what we liked, remembered how we took our coffee, and went WAY out of the way to assist. Housekeeping brought a bouquet of flowers & a cake made of flowers and towels to celebrate my daughter’s BD. They had also decorated the room with birthday posters, which just made her day. The next day, they left cupcakes in the fridge for her! The concierge made all our dinner reservations. Valet was fast and as helpful as can be!! Champagne with fruit was brought to us the first night to celebrate our anniversary. Our room was kept spotless. Every single person we met, saw, or asked a question to was sweet, light hearted, & willing to help us in anyway we asked! Resort service at its best. We travel a lot & it’s been a long time since we’ve experienced such perfection. Total luxury. Peaceful, easy, & relaxed. The pool is awesome w big comfy chairs. Pool service was quick. The beach is so easy to access and probably has the best snorkeling you can find on Maui without having to park & hike trails. We tried several other beaches and thought it was ridiculously crowded or too complicated to enjoy. Sunset views were 😍The Kapalua area is lovely.

625128870,50,"You don't just stay at Montage, you live there. In style!","Ooo… that’s really pretty! Wow.    An hour’s drive from OGG airport (be wary, Taxi’s can be >$90US + tip) is Kapalua Bay and the Montage is located on the Northern end, 15 minutes ($25US Uber) from the Whalers village and central old Laihana. Yet you arrive and all is forgotten.    Walking past reception, you are greeted to a panoramic view of the cascading infinity pools behind the white sand beach. The motto here is you don’t just stay at the Montage but you feel like you “live” there. A home away from home. And if you looked at the real estate, the Montage residences can be yours for 4-5 million US dollars or so.    Here, you really need to request an ocean view property to make the most of it, preferably on a higher floor. The grand residences are closer to the beachfront. And residences they are, some 1200 square feet of living space.    Each residence is self-contained. Fully equipped kitchen, wine fridge, fridge & freezer with coffee maker, blender and kitchen/cooking utensils. Full washing machine and dryer as well as a large, spacious bathroom, tub and double shower. The living area and bedroom offer ample dining and relaxation space. The rooms here are not suites, but a condominium.    The hotel restaurant, Cane & Canoe offered some of the freshest, tastiest Ala Carte breakfast and dinner meals to be found on the island. Nearby (10 minutes walk) is Merryman’s which is also a very reputable pub and restaurant with a view.    UBER into Laihana and plenty more dining options, an outlet mall and also where many tours depart. Be aware helicopter tours depart from OGG so factor that into your cost, transport and timing!    Yet you could be forgiven just staying at the resort. The beach is vast and mostly calm. Snorkel gear is available for hire at $20US / day. And although the elusive green turtles can be hard to find, hidden under the coral, there are ample fish and other sea life just a short swim 20 feet from the beach.    Beach chairs and towels are complementary for hotel guests, although be warned, the service at the beach shack is highly variable. More than once, the lady working there had absolutely no interest in assisting (despite being at least an hour from closing and two from sunset). She flippantly waved us towards the beach and said “that’s all that’s available”. We set up our own chairs and thankfully brought towels from the pool. A letter towards hotel management is forthcoming.    The poolside service could not be faulted. Ample towels, sunscreen and deck chair covers. The staff are polite and only too happy to help assist setting up and saving your chair whilst you’re you in the pool.    We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Montage.

616036008,30,5-Star Pricing... that just did not deliver.,"This is a tough review to write... we were honeymooning and as an self-described 'accomplished traveler'... I really wanted to get this one right. The Montage was a mistake. I was not impressed with the Montage Kapalua Bay property. It is an hour drive to everywhere and the property is just not maintained very well. The grounds were messy and the build facades were algae and mildew stained. When I got the $92 bill for an average omelet, bowl of oatmeal and fruit plate breakfast... I was stunned. The $350, 90-minute massage was good but not worth the ticket. The $28 pineapple pool drink was just average. All together... it just didn't pencil. Having stayed at other Montage properties in the past... they should probably remove the brand badge from this one. It seems that the goal is to be the ""most expensive property on Maui"" and that is the one thing that they achieved.    This was my 6th trip to Maui and I previously stayed in Wailea for four of them (Four Seasons, Grand Wailea, Wailea Beach Villas and a private residence), I would go back there next time. The Four Seasons is the place to go for luxury. We had a drink at the Andaz and it was a very cool, hip spot with a ton of energy too.    Here's what The Montage did well... the bell staff (Ron in particular) was excellent and helpful. Our guest concierge, Camila, was excellent as well. The room/residence was very nice and spacious. We loved our accommodations and the service staff was very, very good. They had champaign, a lei, hats and flowers in our room upon arrival with a very nice note. I was hoping for the VERY best and it was very good but just not worth the coin.    In a word, Disappointing.    Again, sad review because I am a fan and The Montage had set a high bar in the past and worth the extra $$$$... not this time. Oh well.

612735303,50,Great Stay at the Montage Kapalua Bay,"Our family of 5 had a fabulous time at the Montage Kapalua Bay. I booked this based on my experience with the Montage in Laguna Bay and was not disappointed.    We loved every minute, starting with the welcoming leis. The three bedroom, 3 1/2 bath apartment/suite was perfect for our family of 2 adults and 3 teenage daughters. The unit was very well furnished and equipped -- though an electric hot water kettle would have been nice. Everyone had their own bed, we had ample bathrooms, and the room set up provided tons of space to hang out. We had a huge patio balcony with ample seating.    The pool area is lovely -- spacious, creatively divided, with beautiful landscaping. While certain areas would fill up, it did not feel crowded. Poolside staff were very attentive. The poolside food could have been a bit faster, but when you are in Hawaii on vacation, who is in a hurry! We loved the big comfy lounge chairs around the pool.    The beach area at Kapalua Bay was wonderful. It is sheltered and the snorkeling was some of the best we had during two weeks among the Hawaiian Islands -- turtles, tons of colorful fish, and even a reef shark. At the beach, we had excellent service in terms of equipment, chairs and towels. If you want a chair, go in the morning, as they will run out of chair/umbrella space. One day when we showed up later (early afternoon), the staff kept a wait list for chairs and stayed on top of the turnover. The beach is technically a public beach and adjacent to another property. I felt like the Montage guests were particularly well taken care of.    The food is decent, but there is really only one restaurant -- Cane and Canoe. Great place for dinner as you enjoy the sunset. If you are there for more than a day or two, you will want to explore restaurants in Kaanapali and Lahaina. We had room service one morning -- the food was delicious and the service outstanding. Our concierge Camila emailed us before our arrival with restaurant recommendations. We tried several of her recommendations -- Star Noodle (Asian noodles), Sale Pepe (Italian) and Tamura's Fine Wine and Liquor for poke -- and they were all top notch.

611721885,40,Save Your Money.,"My family and I were very disappointed with our uneven and inconsistent stay at this Montage. I would save your money and book elsewhere.    We have stayed at the Montage in Park City and Laguna Beach which are both excellent. I think Montage should pull the flag from this property. It is sub-standard.    The service was inconsistent at best but mostly indifferent. Some of the staff and particularly the locals are lovely people - gracious smiling friendly helpful - a lot of them and most of the stateside and foreign staff are clearly sojourners there and just do not care. I have had better service at the DMV.    Poolside the food was theme-park quality. Over-priced, crappy and gloppy.    I do not know what the plan is with this property but it needs a do-over.    The room was dirty, the floors were sticky, multiple things were broken and while the service folks and brought extra towels or replacement items - and a nice older Hawaiian was always kind to give my elderly mother who was often turned around a quick ride to the pool.    The valets however were indolent and lame. There are two luxury vehicles that stand by at all times. Montage Park City is in constant willingness to provide a ride downtown. When my mother and wife asked for a ride to the Ritz there were told to wait for the free shuttle - which of course took awhile and had no shocks and screwed up her back. What were the 4 valets / attendants doing? Waiting for more tips I assume before they head back to Jersey or Omaha or wherever    It is clear that whoever owns this hotel is pumping every penny out of it - b/c there was nothing luxurious about it and every decision was less - less towels, worse quality food, cheap cheap cheap    The bed was so lumpy that my Mother wanted to sleep on the floor after two nights b/c she was tired of taking Advils and she never complains. Ok rarely:)    The site is beautiful and Kapalua is super windy and not for everyone. But still beautiful and there are remnants of old Hawaii.  We have stayed at the Ritz next door - and that is a big hotel so we wanted the kitchen and to be altogether in one suite with a kitchen.    But I would not stay at this hotel again - and if you see from my reviews I stay at nice places and I am not hugely price sensitive - but I do expect quality and value for the high prices and this place was a gargantuan disappointment to me, and to my family - and with vacation time so precious it just amplified my disappointment..    There are a lot of good reviews as well and I find this bewildering but they may have lower expectations of a Montage or the value of their time/money.

610065487,50,Hurricane Review,"We are still in the middle of our visit but thought it was worthwhile to write a review. Our original plan was to spend a week at the Westin Nanea (timeshare rental) and come to the Montage at the end of our Maui vacation for a special three-day treat.    Everyone on the islands has seen Hurricane Lane coming for several days. Being the over-preparer, as soon as it appeared that Lane would threaten the islands I went into planning mode, water, food, etc. Staying at the Westin Nanea, I noted that they made official government information available, but it was the same as what you could see on the local news or Weather Channel. They were super scarce on details of what specifically the hotel was doing to keep people safe. When I inquired directly with a manager, she was incredibly defensive and seemed frazzled, basic questions about food, water, service etc where generally answered but when I suggested that they provide more details to guests, she became rude and annoyed, which led me to feel super uncomfortable about the general preparedness of the hotel. I spent my last morning there schlepping a large 8-person table and chairs off the balcony, even though the manager stated this would be done by staff (until I got a flyer demanding that we do this ourselves). Effectively, the communications were more about what we could do for them, and what they weren’t going to do for us.    So I called the Montage and asked if we could check-in a day early. It appeared that they were sold out on-line but they clearly stopped taking reservations on purposes. They encouraged us to come over.    We arrived Thursday morning during the proverbial calm before the storm. From getting out of the car, the team (and I mean team) whisked us away, leaving our car stacked high with provisions to them to handle for us, and while our room wasn’t ready (9:30 am maybe?) we had a lovely breakfast while we waited. After a walk on the grounds we came back to the lobby and were immediately approached saying our room was available (several hours early) and that were were given a complimentary upgrade from a 2-bedroom to a 4-bedroom grand suite. We never asked, it was simply given. The most important thing, was that every single person/staff we spoke to made a point of reassuring us just how safe we were. From the location high above the ocean, to the way the buildings were built, there was a level of calm and security that was essential in this situation.    We are at the end of day 2, and of course there are a few limitations which are completely expected, but even so, the Montage team is on point. After being told there was no room service for today (of course), we had an unexpected visit with provisions, fruits/cookies/milk which was really nice. The restaurant is also open, but we chose to just hunker down but still nice to know. The team continues to call and check in to see if we need anything and provide constant updates.    While we are fingers crossed hopeful that we are out of the woods, we are just so impressed with the level of professionalism and appreciative of this team. Of course the staff also had to be nervous and have their own family to take care of but everyone we talked to was extremely confident in our safety and positive about how their management was also helping them through this trying time It’s just super impressive and very much appreciated.    I hope to one day visit this resort again when it’s sunny and beautiful, but a big “mahalo” from the Sapios family!",Aug 2018,August 2018,Traveled with family,,"Northville, Michigan"
608648836,30,Great Location - poor service,"We have stayed at other Montage locations and many, many Four Seasons hotels all over. This hotel is lacking in service to their other Montage hotels and definitely not comparable in terms of service to Four Seasons.    We stayed in a beautiful owner villa which is part of the hotel. We had full access to hotel pool, spa, etc. so were able to experience that part of the hotel.    The service by the pool was not good. They came by maybe once at most twice to see if we needed water. It was so hot that it would have been nice to get some cold water.    Booked spa services and they got the services wrong. Once that was fixed, the massages were great.

599057840,20,Montage: Expensive...but not worth it,"The Montage rooms are spectacular. We enjoyed a spacious one bedroom with a beautiful living room/ kitchen and stunning, wrap around balcony - what you'd expect for $1500 a night. Unfortunately, most other hotel services/ amenities aren't 5 star.    1) the beach is very average for a 5 Star resort. The sand is quite narrow and small leading to a cramped feeling and getting a chair is not a given. And even with a chair, the service is non-existent: you cannot order a drink or food. The snorkeling is great but the cove is quite windy making any boating difficult. At a 5 Star resort you should have ample choice of chairs and servers waiting to take any order - not at the Montage! The only service you'll get is a grouchy guy manning the beach equipment kiosk from where you rent snorkels/ paddle boards. He's constantly complaining about brusque tourists who just damage Hawaii's pristine areas...sorry, man but we're paying your salary.    2) The pool area is good, not great. I noticed peeling paint and chipped/ old tiles throughout the resort. Worse, you must pay $400 a day to reserve a Cabana. The Montage selects the best Cabanas and erects a large RESERVE sign...It all felt quite 'grabby' as-if your $1500 a night isn't enough, lets take $400 more and that theme continues throughout the resort.    3) Breakfast..no buffet. I enjoy a buffet so I can load up on fruit. The Montage, however, doesn't offer a buffet instead forcing you to order a la carte (read: more money). Want a lot of fruit? Good luck, you'll need to order 3 fruit plates ($75) because their portions are stingy.    4) I was somewhat hot in the room and tried to lower the AC - wouldn't work. I called the front desk who informed me that all the thermostats cannot be adjusted???? 72 only. Again, I was shocked. Guests aren't trusted or empowered to adjust the AC? I've never experienced that in any Mainland hotel. Not to repeat myself, but at $1500 a night I should be able to make the room as cool as I want.    In summary, the rooms are exquisite but not much else is. I would not go back.",Jul 2018,July 2018,Traveled as a couple,,
598072048,50,We are forever spoiled!!,"What can I say? We wanted to take the trip of a lifetime and The Montage was HUGE in making that happen. Our experience was truly flawless! We arrived to warm Hawaiian greetings with leis and a quick tour of the property. The accommodations were SPECTACULAR in every sense. As a party of 6, we never felt cramped when inside. Lots of space. The pool area was fantastic....adult pools, family pool etc. we never had a problem getting chairs. The beach provided some of the best snorkeling EVER and we even “swam with the sea turtles!” Perhaps one of the best things about the Montage is the level of service. All of the concierges were wonderful and I do mean wonderful but our personal concierge Anna repeatedly went above and beyond for us. She knew we were celebrating our anniversary and she sent over a gorgeous bird of paradise flower arrangement for us as well as dessert a few days later. She booked a number of excursions for us as well. I could go on and on but I will sum things up and say: if you can, you MUST stay at the Montage. We will not stay anywhere else in Maui!

Fresh fruits and welcome gift on arrival, water and towels given to us by valet every day. Housekeeping was amazing, emptying and cleaning our coffee pot every day as well as putting away the dished from the dishwasher.    My only complaint was a less than accommodating hostess at the Cane and Canoe restaurant when trying to make reservations on the date of our sons departure.

595386922,40,Gorgeous resort in paradise,"We loved everything about this resort! It’s gorgeous in a quiet part of Maui. Everyone working at the resort greeted us by name. The accommodations were beautiful and we loved the huge patio overlooking the ocean.    The only reason I did not give this resort a 5 Star review is because we booked a 1 bedroom unit but were placed in a 2 bedroom unit and they locked the 2nd bedroom so we could not use it. I have never heard of a 5 star resort doing such a thing! We have stayed at some really nice resorts and the resort would always upgrade us if this was the situation. We called and asked and they told us they would not open the 2nd room unless we paid the difference in price. This left a bad taste in our mouths! They would not be able to rent out the 2nd bedroom that week and would not be making any additional money, so it was shocking that they would not be willing to upgrade us and give our family a bit more room and providing excellent customer service. Why put us in a 2 bedroom if they weren’t going to allow us to use the 2nd bedroom?    I contacted the manager of the resort and corporate about this issue and did not receive any response. Very disappointing!    Other than that detail, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.

591285474,50,4th Trip - Montage Better Than Ever Relative to Others on Maui,"We've (family of 3 with a 6-year old) had the good fortune of visiting the Montage 4 times in the last 3 years and every visit is the same - awesome. This trip we also stayed at the Fairmont Kea Lani and The Grand Wailea - these hotels while also very nice make the Montage look ever better not only from an overall experience standpoint but also, believe it or not from a value perspective.    THE BOTTOM LINE: You will not go wrong by planning your Maui vacation around the Montage. While everyone's version of paradise is a bit different The Montage delivers warm service, great pool, incredibly spacious and well appointed accommodations (condominiums), amazing beach a 3 minute walk away and an incredible spa. Also I paid $1400 per night for a 1-bedrooom ocean view through Amex and at this price point on Maui I think Montage is very fairly priced - a bargain if anything at $1400 per night can be considering such a thing. We spent $1200 on a Napua Tower room at the Grand Wailea and that was only 800 square feet!    Details:  - With only about 60 condominiums as part of a larger home ownership community the atmosphere is very personalized. We know employees by name and remarkably many employees know us by name as well. It's a nice addition to a great property.  - All accommodations are 3-bedroom condominiums - although they will close off 1 or 2 bedrooms to serve the needs of smaller parties and also charge less.  - Every condo has a LARGE balcony with 2 lounges, a huge daybed and a dining table that seats 4.  - Kitchen, although we never use it is all high end appliances and is beautiful  - Since last year they've done some renovations - new paint in the condos, some new art, new carpeting and some new furniture. Since is was built only around 9 years ago the atmosphere overall is current and fresh as compared to other properties on Maui that tend to be 30ish years old.  - After the Grand Wailea for 3 days we were ready to go back to the Montage. It's peaceful without being boring. No fighting for a chair here - there are plenty to go around.  - Fitness center and Spa are next level. I don't do massages often but this was amazing. They have small outdoor huts in a bamboo garden where you can get your massage. Pretty magical and incredibly relaxing.  - Unlike some other high end resorts, kids are VERY welcome here and my daughter met lots of kids some of whom we're going to see back home in San Diego. Great families and a perfect environment for the entire family from infants through grandparents.  - Small detail after visiting other properties - these rooms are QUIET. I mean you will never hear another soul from inside your room. And they have blackout shades which makes sleeping in awesome.    Nit picky feedback for management:  - Housekeeping is still all over the map in terms of service times. One day it's 9 am and another they didn't come until after 4:00. Not sure if this is staffing levels or what but feels like rooms should be serviced by early afternoon so you're not coming back to shower only to have housekeeping in the room.",Jun 2018,June 2018,Traveled with family,"They're all awesome.

590761171,50,beautiful stay,"came to Montage Kapalua Bay because we did not feel safe to go to Haulalai Four Season on the Big Island due to volcano eruption. We go to Hualalai once or twice a year. The Montage turns out to be a nice treat. It is a little far away from where the action is but if you want a relaxation and a hang out place, the Montage fits the bill. the residence is very quiet. the elevator opens to your room only so no foot traffic. the view is gorgeous. the room is very big. we had two bedrooms and three bathrooms. there is a nice kitchen, dishwasher, two sinks. The kitchen is fully equipped so if you stopped by a grocery store, you can have a place to cook. they also provide a barbecue grill so you can barbecue your fish or meat. the service is excellent. People are very nice and helpful. the only negative thing was the breakfast which was very slow and hit and missed on our requests. asked for no salt and the food came sprinkled with salt. Had to send food back twice but they were very nice about taken it off the bill so I cannot give them lower than 5 star. If the breakfast is better, we would love it. However, if you just want basic stuffs like eggs and oatmeal, they are fine. they have good juice. the spa is amazing with good treatments.

587822571,50,Amazing experience for entire family,"Although we stayed at the Montage in May, I delayed writing this review for several weeks because I had to adjust to life back in reality. We went to Maui for an extended family vacation (ages 11-54) and agonized over lodging as we needed a property that would have interesting activities for all. The Montage was clearly the right decision. The property is difficult to describe. Beautiful, luxurious, well maintained, and quite simply, just spectacular. From the moment of arrival at the Montage, the experience was incredible. The staff is courteous, attentive, and beyond helpful.    We booked a 3 bedroom grand residence for the extra space as there were 7 of us. My spouse and I have had the privilege of traveling extensively, and I must say that this property is easily one of the most luxurious. The furnishings can best be described as subdued luxury -- gorgeous, yet comfortable and inviting. Although more expensive than the other units, I highly recommend the splurge of a grand residence. You will not regret it.    As mentioned above, the staff takes great effort to ensure no detail is overlooked, including a cute drawing and name plate for the children's room. They were also very helpful in scheduling activities, providing recommendations, and making reservations. Each group is assigned a concierge to assist with travel plans. Wonderful idea. Our concierge, Camila, worked tirelessly with me prior to the trip to plan excursions. In addition to our concierge, the entire team of staff from housekeeping to valet were also attentive, responsive, and outstanding. Customer service is clearly a priority for the Montage staff. They take a genuine interest in their guests. In addition to Camila, I must give a huge thank you to Ben, Vanessa, as well as the entire valet team who even went out of their way to assist us when we had a mechanical problem with one of our rental vehicles. Truly above and beyond.    With respect to on site activities, naturally, the ocean is the draw. Snorkeling, paddle board and other equipment is available on site for guest use. Also, there are numerous swimming pools which are lovely, and designed to include various alcoves to give a feel of privacy. To be candid, I was somewhat concerned that the Montage, with its quiet luxury, would not have enough amenities and activities to hold the interest of active children and teens. WRONG. Despite the fact that the Montage does not have water slides like some hotels/resorts in Lahaina, the kids all universally LOVED the property. In fact, with so many beach and water activities, they didn't spend a great deal of time in the pool. Nonetheless, the hotel has so many offerings that even the teens were usually exhausted and in bed early.    Finally, I must mention the spa. WOW. Beautiful, tranquil, and also spectacular. The outdoor treatment rooms are definitely the way to go for the ultimate in relaxation.    Highest recommendation for the Montage. Best family vacation ever!!!

585651776,50,Amazing resort in Kapalua,"This was an amazing, private, quiet spot in northwestern Maui. The pros: staff were amazingly helpful, the ""rooms"" were actually high ceiling well appointed condos. Spacious rooms, full kitchens, lovely view AND a great lanai where we spent each morning having our coffee and many sunsets. There are not tourists making the community spaces and beaches crowded. There are beautiful and separated spaces for adults to get away from children (if desired!) at the pools. The restaurant on the property was really amazing for breakfast and dinner. The community spaces - lobby, restaurant, pool are - were beautiful and well maintained. The rooms were comfortable as were the beds. The cons: it is remote to nightlife, shopping and other restaurants. In addition, we had a noisy family move in upstairs and they woke us up every morning before 5am. We were there to rest so this was NOT welcome and I'm not sure the staff did anything to reach out to the family to tell the to keep things quiet before 8 am. Chalk that up to bad luck. And not great insulation in the ceiling/floors? Also, that section of the island can be more rainy than the more southern areas. What we experienced was that it was so cloudy and drizzly that for the 12 days we were there, we didn't do a lot of laying out by the pool or beach that we would have done. We kept hopping in the car (which we didn't want to do) to go to Lahaina or even Wailea to find any sun. This was apparently a problem this year and cannot be blamed on Montage Bay. HOWEVER, this side of the island is known to be more cloudy and drizzly then others so take that into consideration if it is important to you. Also, the volcano eruption on the big island made NO impact on Maui while we were there and would not have stopped us from going.

Location, amenities (the pools!) and service are stellar and the place is drop dead gorgeous. BUT, I have to mention that I was very disappointed with the cleanliness of our suite on arrival - it was not up to my expectations for a Montage, or really any hotel/resort accommodations. I actually own a vacation rental business (most properties well below the price point here) and our suite wouldn’t have come close to passing my company’s inspection. Many surfaces and areas of the floor were not cleaned after the prior guest (crumbs in corners of floors, a line of sand along the edge of the rug, prints on glass surfaces, sticky jam spots on wood floor). We also found discarded tags in the closet and crayons and candy wrappers in the yard area of our ground floor lanai. The rug and sofa were stained. It is really hard to complain because the suite was everything we’d hoped for otherwise and the bedding and bathroom were very clean! I did bring this to the attention of the front desk on arrival and was told they’d do a deep clean the next day, but I didn’t notice a change, so I did some cleaning myself and gave up. There was no further follow up from management.  We had a wonderful time at the spa - the little individual treatment cabins are so relaxing with the ocean breeze coming in, highly recommend!  I enjoyed the Sunday brunch at Cane and Canoe but other meals there and at the pool were average and we missed trying some places we heard were great off-site in exchange for convenience, which I regret.

The resort is so peaceful and relaxing. There were always cabanas and pool chairs available with excellent pool side service. The staff were what made this place that much better. They are so attentive, so kind and remember your name, your food preferences every single time. This is a fantastic resort to enjoy with the family or as a couple. The views in the suites are on another level not to mention the size of the rooms! Same goes for the spa and fitness facilities. They were all exceptional. We were so happy to have stayed here and hope to be back again soon!",May 2018,May 2018,Traveled with family,,"Danville, California"
582201406,50,Like a dream come true!,"Celebrating our 30th anniversary and I was looking for accommodations that would be wonderful for our family of five. Our stay at the Montage was truly amazing! From the moment we arrived we were treated with the warmest hospitality and just like family. We booked a complimentary photographer Pacific Dream through the concierge and it was the most amazing experience! The photographer was so nice and made us all look beautiful on the impeccable landscape of the Montage. We also went on a snorkel boat 5 hour tour with Blue Water. It was a smaller boat with a larger than life experience and the crew was so impressive with their knowledge of the islands and new gear.  If you need a magical trip to remember stay at the Montage!

581426061,50,A day by day stay at the Montag Kapalua Bay (Saturday arrival),"I've decided to take a different approach to this Trip Advisor review. Instead of summarizing our entire week, we will share each day of our trip as a separate review. Why am I writing this review at 4 AM Maui time? Unless you live on a neighboring island, you are likely traveling from the mainland of another continent. Upon arriving at the Kahilui Airport (OGG), your eyes tell you one time zone and your body is screaming something else. After our 9 hour flight form Chicago, we arrived at the Montage Saturday early afternoon. The staff from the greeters at the entrance to the checkin staff truly recognize that there is a high probably that you and your family are time disoriented and scoot you along as rapidly as possible but in a warm sympathetic fashion. Our entire process took less than 10 minutes. We were escorted to our suite ,or home is more appropriate in building one by other resort staff who show you all the features of your suite and the quietly let you collapse on the nearest couch. We were fortunate enough to get booked into Suite 1605 (thru the the wonderful efforts of concierge, Misti Lanoza. More on her later), a top floor 3 bedroom, 3 1/2 bath, full high end kitchen, etc. Grand Residence Premier Ocean View unit. These units are the closest to the ocean and are essentially condominium units of 2700 sq ft.more than enough room for our party of 5 adults. The view is, in a word, phenomenal. Our first recommendation is, if you can swing it, reserve one of these units in building one. You are literally steps to the beach, a little further to the main pool complex. Coming from the Chicago area everyone immediately went to the pool, ordered a drink and ""adjusted"" to the sunny 80 degree weather. We decided to use in residence dining (from Cane and Canoe Restaurant) for dinner. Among the items ordered where Margherita Pizza, Wagyu Beef Burger, Kona Lobster Roll Sliders and Island Fried Rice with Chicken. The portions were good and in summary, the ""if you don't finish it, I will be happy to take it off your hands"" prevailed. Excellent food and minimal wait. Now for a technical comment. We wondered about the internet speed of these units as there were an average of 2 connected devices per person. We are happy to report that this unit averaged 85 - 100 mbs download and mid 20's mbs upload. No problem there. Day 2 Sunday to follow.",May 2018,May 2018,Traveled with family,,"Glenview, Illinois"
579494919,50,Outstanding hotel with impeccable service!,"Our family recently returned from a 4 night stay at the Montage Kapalua Bay and we could not have been happier with our visit!    Prior to our arrival at the Montage we had spent 4 nights at the Fairmont Kea Lani. This was also a nice hotel, but the differences in service were striking, and made all of the difference on our vacation.    The impeccable service at the Montage started as soon as we arrived. The valet walked us to reception (while others took care of our luggage), stopping at the koi pond to show our kids the fish and reminding them not to miss the feeding each morning. In the lobby he stopped to introduce us to the cultural director of the hotel, who told us about the upcoming hula dancing and ukulele activities being offered in the coming days. He then stopped at a wagon full of stuffed animals and asked our kids to each select one, which they were thrilled with. Finally, he explained to them how they could earn badges by completing various challenges throughout the stay. We were given cool towels and drinks to refresh ourselves.    We then met our concierge (Misti), who had helped us with planning our stay prior to arrival. She gave us a walking tour of the grounds while walking us to our room. Misti was so helpful both before and during our trip - we loved the service she provided! She even gave us a well-appreciated hug when we arrived :)    Upon opening our door we saw a wonderful hand-drawn poster from the kids club staff welcoming our children to the hotel. These little details may not sound like much, but it really made the difference throughout our entire stay. There was also a nice gift for my wife and I who were celebrating our anniversary.    As soon as we arrived at our room the bellmen were delivering our luggage. Since we were staying in one of the 1-bedroom residences we had stopped to pick up some groceries on the way to the hotel, and the staff unpacked everything into the refrigerator and cabinets for us - again, outstanding service.    The room was absolutely stunning with an enormous deck overlooking the grounds and ocean. It had lounge chairs, a dining table, and a round outdoor couch that was so comfortable I even slept in it one night to enjoy the nice weather and sounds of crashing waves from the ocean. The room was very spacious and well appointed, with a full kitchen and laundry room.    Throughout our stay we were just consistently impressed with the outstanding service. The staff would address us by name, and were always overly accommodating. We ate several times at the fire tables outside the lounge, and the servers were fantastic everywhere. Even our children (7 & 10) commented on how nice everyone was.    We spent a lot of our time relaxing in and around the pools and beach. I had read reviews saying that you have to arrive early to secure chairs by the pool, but we never experienced any problems - there were always plenty available. The pool has many different areas so we could escape with the kids to play with a ball or other games and not disturb others, and the temperature was perfect.    We loved the Kapalua bay (a 3 minute walk) and the snorkeling activities just off the shore. We saw lots of turtles and even a 4-foot friendly shark (who was sleeping in a cove) along with countless fish. The kids loved the paddle-boarding as well.    The hotel offered an evening program where children could use the kids club while we went to dinner, which was fantastic. The kids absolutely loved it because they explored the tide pools and other nighttime creatures with the outstanding staff, and asked to return the next night.    A courtesy vehicle was always available to take us to some of the nearby restaurants and shops. Make sure to visit the Honolua market - a great spot to pick up some breakfast or lunch & souvenirs. Nearby we did zip lining and golf and walked the shores with a guide also organized by the hotel.    The cultural director (I wish I could remember her name - she was so friendly and had the kids call her ""Auntie ..."") was also fantastic. We enjoyed the hula class and ukulele lessons, and earned 9 of the 12 badges during our stay.    We've had the great fortune to stay at a lot of nice hotels over the years, but the level of service at Montage Kapalua was truly outstanding, making this one of the most memorable family vacations we've ever enjoyed.

We felt like we were the only ones there at some points. The service was also great. Very friendly staff. The only complaint we had was during dinner the one night we ate at the restaurant. There were so many gnats because the restaurant is open to the elements. I will be back to Montage for sure. It’s a totally different experience then staying at some of the other resorts that have triple the amount of people. This was much more relaxing.",May 2018,January 2018,Traveled with friends,,"San Francisco, California"
575682751,50,Pacific Dream Photography,Our experience with Pacific Dream Maui Montage was top notch!! We have had numerous professional photographers on our family vacations and this by far was the best experience with the best pictures. We were a group of 10 (2 families of 5).

575507027,50,Paradise,"This was the favourite of the six hotels we stayed in on our three week, three island, adventure in Hawaii. Easily beating two Four Seasons resorts, despite being significantly cheaper.  The pool deck is fabulous - beautifully landscaped around pools on multiple levels, with waterfalls in between. It was noticeably much busier at the weekend than during the week  The view from our huge balcony (which had day bed, 4 loungers, dining table and chairs) was perfect - over the pool area, some palm trees, the ocean, with waves breaking on the reef that protects the beach and Lana’i in the distance.  Our residence was huge and luxurious with a full very well equipped kitchen and it’s own laundry.  We enjoyed both breakfast and dinner once at the on site restaurant which was good quality. There are only limited eating choices within walking distance, but Lahaina is only about 20 minutes drive away.  Service levels were simply the best we found anywhere on our trip.  Snorkelling from the protected beach was the best we had on the trip and included swimming with a turtle.  We’ll be back.",Apr 2018,April 2018,Traveled as a couple,,"Greater London, United Kingdom"

Accommodations were awesome. Staff was friendly from the moment we set foot onto the resort and until the time we checked out. The only thing I feel is lacking is the dining options. Had a massage at the spa and Noelle was the best! The kids truly had a wonderful time at the beaches/pools and the hubby and I truly got to relax and enjoy our time there. Loved that the resort provided a service to set up a photoshoot for us- even though our kids are not always compliant, especially in front of a camera, they managed to get a ton of great shots.

573169227,50,Perfect family trip!,"We stayed in a 3bedroom condo at Montage. The staff was phenomenal. Great activities for our children aged 5&8. Auntie Cilla taught ukulele lessons, how to make a lei and was a great (free) activity that gave us some Hawaiian history. We enjoyed a morning seashell hunt with Chelsea from Paintbox who could not have been better. Our kids also enjoyed a 1/2 day at Paintbox another day. She was wonderful! The weather wasn’t super warm in March while we were there but we still enjoyed the pool and beach (giant turtles keeping there). While we were poolside one day it did start to rain. I watched a pool attendant run around in the rain covering strollers guests had left out which was such a thoughtful gesture that wouldn’t always happen. Daily feeding of the koi and the Montage badges that the kids earned doing certain Hawaiian things was a great touch that our kids really enjoyed.",Apr 2018,March 2018,Traveled with family,,Pennsylvania
571785623,50,Beautiful Resort,"Beautiful resort! The units are very nicely furnished and decorated. We had our two small children with us in a two bedroom/2.5 bath unit and it was more than enough space. Washer/dryer was very convenient. The main pool is beautiful but was crowded when we were there and we had a hard time finding pool chairs each day of our 6 day stay. On the last day, they sent us over to the other pool at the Beach Club, which was a much smaller pool, but at least we had some chairs. Breakfast at Cane & Canoe was expensive (as expected) but good. Ate lunch at the pool each day - food was good. Our kids enjoyed the cultural classes - ukulele, lei making and hula dancing. They also really liked the stuffed animals they received at check-in. The property is very pretty, the service is good and if we ever go back to Maui, we would stay here again.",Apr 2018,April 2018,Traveled with family,,
571777613,50,5 Star Family Vacation (Even with a few hiccups),"Minor hiccups:  -We payed for the premier ocean view after viewing the photos online, not what I had expected. If you're not a member/owner you are limited to only two buildings, these two are on either side of the main entrance. So, the premier ocean view (which is the higher floor) overlooks the pool then you see the ocean.  -Trouble with internet the first 2 days  -Finding a seat at the pool (Really need to work on this one, people save spots and leave. The staff was helpful to bring out more chairs when we requested them.)  -Food, hit or miss. Cane and Canoe was underwhelming, especially for the price. We did have some great meals at the pool and room service was pleasant.    I understand a few other reviews that compared this to the Ritz and FourSeasons, in my opinion, our experience at the Montage exceeded the experiences we've had at other 5 star resorts. Why? The service- everyone was very helpful and went out of their way to make our experience a good one. No attitude, it was as if everyone was happy to be there! We were eating lunch at the pool when they called and said our room was ready, we asked them to put our things in the room and we would be up after lunch.... they not only put our things in our room, the bell staff unpacked our groceries! Concierge went above and beyond! We arrived Easter morning, I had sent Easter baskets to be waiting in our room so our girls would think the Easter bunny came, went off perfectly!    Rooms- beautiful, huge, well equipped. Housekeeping was amazing! If we needed anything, they were there within 5 min, really!! PaintBox (kids club) was top notch. Not the typical childcare with a few activities, they went out of their way to make our girls happy; exploring in the tide pools, beach, pool, painting, feeding the koi fish, I could go on and on. Our girls couldn't stop talking about it.  Bell staff- quick to offer coupons for dinner, cold water bottles in our car waiting for us and towels when we were headed out. (Even took care of boxing my husband's clubs to ship home.)  The Montage even offers a family photo session! Unfortunately, the weather didn't cooperate with us, but Tiffany still managed to get some great shots of our girls!  As far as a family vacation, the Montage pulled off the perfect week!

571250539,50,Excellent Lunch at the Hana Hou Ocean View Bar,"My wife and I stopped into the Montage Resort for lunch this past January when we were in the Kapalua area (we were not guests of this lovely resort). What a BEAUTIFUL, luxurious property. We walked the grounds and were overly impressed by the warm, helpful, and professional staff we ran across; each and everyone of them asked us (with a big warm smile) if they could help us out in any way - very PROFESSIONAL!! We ended up eating lunch at the Hana Hou Ocean View Bar restaurant; my wife had the fish tacos which she raved about the rest of the day; I had the turkey club sandwich which was very, very good and tasty. Our waitress (unfortunately I forget her name - long blondish coloured hair) was so friendly and helpful - EXCELLENT service to say the least. The view from the Hana Hou pool bar is outstanding excellent view of Lanai and Molakai. The resort is located right next to Napili Beach; a beautiful sandy beach.

570884266,30,Four Star Service at Five Star Prices,"You know how at the end of a Broadway show everyone gives a standing ovation now, regardless of the quality of the show, because you've spent so much money you want to justify how you've spent it and assure yourself you've had a good time? That's how I felt reflecting on my experience at the Montage after having read so many unequivocally stellar reviews of this property and then comparing them to our experience. But for $3k/night, why shouldn't we have an amazing time?? We didn't. It was fine, but it was only amazing when we entered the room the first time and when we saw whales from our lanai -- it never had anything to do with amenities or service. Montage Kapalua is a fine property, and it was a good fit for our family's situation (three related adults + 2 spouses + 2 young children in a three bedroom ocean grand suite), but for much less money we could have rented our own house and paid two locals to wait on us full-time for a week.    Now, here's why this review is unfair -- at about the same price for three rooms at the Ritz or Four Seasons, we would have had much less space (no central living area, no kitchen) and maybe not as many complaints based off expectations/price. Nevertheless, I didn't leave Montage feeling all that satisfied, so here are the notable pluses and minuses:    The good:  - Oh dear god, go book a massage with Bo at the spa. Wow.  - Occasional small touches, like when the juice bar made my toddler niece a smoothie her size or brought my sister gummy bears at the pool. But that was about it.  - The privacy. Didn't feel like we had to worry too much about someone complaining about a crying baby or someone looking into our lanai.  - Kapalua Bay beach. We went to several other beaches in Maui including Kaanapali, DT Fleming, etc. and none of them were as clean or relatively calm and uncrowded as Kapalua. It felt like a private beach, which was a huge plus to have within walking distance.  - The views. Could see whales and dolphins from our lanai on the regular.  - The walk-in closets in the master bedrooms were so large that the kids' crib or pack'n'play could easily fit in it. In general, the rooms seemed larger than in the online pix.  - Lots of different areas in the pool for lots of different needs -- relaxing, bubble beds, tiered pool for kids, waterfalls. Liked it, if too warm.  - We liked the activities we did, like koi fish feeding and tidepool exploration for the kids. Would have liked even more choices and certainly more shopping options.    The ""needs improvement"":  - We came in with a toddler and an infant. It wasn't like we were hiding them. But there was essentially no attention paid to our situation: I had to ask about the toy wagon because I'd read it on other reviews, it was never offered to us. Housekeeping and the front desk both rang our doorbell/called during naptimes or after the babies went to bed. Better service would have asked about how late they could call or when housekeeping could best attend our room -- instead we had to put separate alerts on the phone, pay attention to the ""do not disturb"" with every nap, call housekeeping separately -- it was quite an ordeal.  - Waited an hour for room service our first night after multiple attempts to get the order right. Two of us couldn't wait that long, so we headed to Cane & Canoe right at 5p when they opened. It was empty, of course, but they wouldn't seat us because we didn't have reservations and referred us to the lounge that had the same menu. The restaurant was only 20% full when we walked through again an hour later after our meal. This interaction was repeated throughout our stay, and never once did we get seated or did they even offer to make us a reservation for the next night or anything.  - My bathroom's sun lotion bottle had clearly been used without being replaced when we arrived.  - Housekeeping was shockingly uneven. The first time they came, they did our dishes, so we were like ""great, we don't have to do them!"". Flash-forward several days when they left a pot half-full of old pasta on the stove through the end of our trip and obvious trash left on kitchen countertops. Then they threw away my greeting lei without asking me, and it was not near a garbage can. They kept rearranging my bathroom toiletries in different configurations on the sink every day after I would put them back the way I liked them, at one point putting a glass bottle close enough to the edge that my toddler niece could reach it, and it fell and shattered. They took a hairbursh from where I had it and hid it in a drawer. It felt unnecessary, persnickety, and even invasive. The last two days, I simply didn't allow them to enter my room.  - The noise level was surprisingly poor. I shared a wall with the guest master, and I could hear everything in their room, from my crying niece to which episode of Elmo she was watching on the phone. We almost asked to change rooms after the constant footsteps and music thumping from the room above ours.  - We swiped three credit cards at check-in so our individual parties could make charges as they saw fit. Two days later, we were called to say the cards hadn't saved and we needed to go back to the front desk. No apology, no attempt to make it less inconvenient, just a mistake, wasted time, and awkwardness between the three parties over separating out charges that had been made.  - We didn't have a single outing at the pool without some issue, like finding an open chair with a new towel on it but someone moves our stuff after an hour and claims it was always theirs. No one from the hotel offered to help my cousin with her newborn find a place in the shade so they could be outside. Everyone is paying so much that there's a lot of entitlement but no hotel service to match or balance the egos from the fellow guests. People were there, barely, but never attentive or asking how they could help.  - The noise on the lanai is like an echo chamber in the master bedroom, making it largely unusable unless the people in that room are awake or you don't care about pissing them off.    None of this is particularly egregious, but it is all annoying, irksome, and unacceptable at the price. Like I said, we wouldn't be upset to return per se, but we'd definitely look at other options before we did. If I were by myself in Maui, I'd definitely go elsewhere.",Apr 2018,March 2018,Traveled with family,"Building two has ocean views but no pool/restaurant in sight, which means it's the best...","New York City, New York"

Certainly not inexpensive but expected. We had in room dining once but that fell short of all of our expectations. The pools and hot tubs were very nice and the view from the infinity pool is beautiful. What I did the most was some kind of entertainment in the evening and Hawaiian music. It was a bit too quiet without these offerings for me but luckily we went to a Laua off property and that was amazing. I missed the authentic feel to this property..I do think this property does a lot of things right ( as it should for the price) but I came away feeling a bit underwhelmed--I think that I could have been ""anywhere"" and really missed the ""Hawaiian"" touches and spirit.

Amenities are great too between the terraced pool and close proximity to great snorkeling in Kapalua Bay. Pool is crowded and quiet difficult to get a chair. First day was told there were no pool chairs left and that was before 10 am. Other days were difficult too and we only got seats because we went down to the pool quite early to get a seat. Less than relaxing, especially at these high rates. Service at the pool is also quite spotty.

We are in one of the most spacious 2 bedroom suites I have ever stayed in with a hotel of this rating. Huge balcony, full kitchen which we had stocked by their referred online grocery store which was very cool having stocked after a late night arrival.    The entire staff is friendly, The Concierge girls Ana and Whitney truly exceptional. Ana knocked out a great itinerary and has updated it on the minute with weather changes. The girls all pro! One side of the property has a beautiful seaside walking trail and the other side its own private little cove for swimming.

There were only two luggage racks and we all hate being on our knees on the floor to access each piece, When I was asked after checking us in to the room ""Is there anything else we can do for you"" I asked for more luggage racks (2 for 4 people and obviously a minimal of 4 luggage's ?) - 30 minutes later the bellman returns to say "" We don't normally do this but as a special favor we are going to open up the 3RD bedroom of the suite and take an extra one for you"" - I said "" You know what, don't do me any favors, you should have not asked us of we needed something else"", 15 minutes later they returned with 2 more. But who says that? At these rates its a favor to give you a luggage rack? You have it or you don't and its not a favor at these prices!    The Tvs, In most hotels you turn them on and choose your channel. Not here! You turn them on and get a ""no signal"" screen. Upon calling they explain that there's a trick to it. You have to turn them on, go down to a tiny written word ""input"" and slide them over with the channel key to HDMI (there 5 options), Theeeen you can go to Guide and watch TV. Why not put a small laminated card explaining that? I had to go room to room to give the tutorial as no one of course could know this with out being taught.    Room Service: The menu is ""ok"", nothing special but its the wait! If your lucky they will tell you its 1 hour and 15 minutes to get anything. If your unlucky they tell you its 40 to 45 mins and then you wait 1 hour 15 to 1 hour 30 mins anyway. I don't care that's its ""high season"" you saw the bookings in advance so prepare for that - No 5 Star I have ever stayed in takes 1 15 mins to bring you a waffle or hamburger! This mornings waffle and two fat slices of toast came with 3 small round balls of butter which didn't even cover 1 slice , salt and pepper are never added, you get 1 tiny catsup for your huge plate of fries and a hamburger? Your not asked what condiments you want - they send two and if you want something else (mayo?) you don't bother calling back- who can wait an another hour!    The annoying recording:So when you call and they transfer you its met with a recording "" Welcome to the Montage, our front dest and concierge are busy taking care of other guests, please hold"" The problem is it plays every 20 seconds instead of just going to pleasant music, It will drive you mad to hear it 50 times before someone answers!    The bedding. Don't make the mistake of laying down after playing in the sand before you shower because they change the sheets ""Once ever 4 days for conservation reasons"" - Well do they pass that savings down to the consumer? Not with these prices! You will sleep on those dirty sheets and pay $1,800 a night! The fish are better off and so is the hotel but its not very 5 star if you didn't okay it if you ask me!    Housekeeping: These girls are machines! They can deck a unit out in 25 minutes tops, really ,really good. The problem is if you leave that do not disturb sign on past 1 you may get no service at all! So get up early or remember to hang that towel up! I had to beg for a cleaning after not taking the sign off until 1:30 pm and was told at 4:30 pm ""They may have just skipped you and not went back to check to see of you were ready?"",    This may sound petty but put it altogther with hungry family, activity fun filled days with sand and these prices and well, if I wanted this kind of sparce service I would have saved $1,000 a night and stayed at a Hitlon.    Activities and nightlife: There are none. Period. It is very un-lively at night, The day you have the pool and the ocean, at night you leave to go find life.    6 days to go so lets see how it goes from here - Again the location, accomadations and the staff are top notch...but the details are what determine the 5 Star prices I paid and I am not feeling it from the details stated above so far...",Mar 2018,March 2018,Traveled with family,,"Cabo San Lucas, Mexico"

567966389,50,"Great hotel in both service and amenities, and a great vacation.","It was our first time at the Montage, and first time in Maui. Even weeks before we arrived I made plans for activities and restaurant reservations with the concierges. All their suggestions were right on. Thank you Ayami and Luma. I cannot say enough good things for them and all the concierges. We received a warm welcome when we arrived and we immediately fell in love with the hungry fish at the entrance pond. We stayed in a 3 bedroom - 3 1/2 bathroom suite and it was spacious, beautiful and clean. It is really a full residence equipped with a full kitchen (Subzero and Woolf ) and washer and dryer. Not that we cooked because the food was delicious everywhere. The pool service was awesome both in getting sun beds and towels as well as drinks and food. The beach is to the side of the hotel and seems small but it is beautiful. The area right in front of the hotel is ocean water but with cliffs so the beach is to the side.The breakfast was really good and there were many options. There are some brunch options on the breakfast menu as well as fresh juices. I loved the ""spamosa"" which is green juice mixed with champagne. The bell team was awesome. We had rented a car and they were great to get it for us and provide towels for the road and cold water bottles. They were also very pleasant and sent me an exotic bouquet of flowers after I noticed how beautiful their flowers are. This was a special treat, very unexpected but greatly appreciated. Maui is so beautiful and gives you many options for activities. You can spend time in the beach or the pool or you can go on tours and excursions. Some of what we did and enjoyed: The jungle waterfall adventure by Epic Maui Hikes, the helicopter tour of Maui and Molokai by Maverick, the whale watching and snorkeling by Blue Water Maui, the sunrise tour at Haleakala and zip lining by Skyline Hawaii, the Kapalua zip lining, and the luau at the Hyatt Regency close by. If you go on the sunrise tour, go on your first morning, while you are still jet lagged and will wake up ""easily"" at 2 AM. Some of our favorite restaurants were: Mama's Fish House, Merriman's, Sansei, Lahaina Grill, Honu, Pacific'O. The seafood is same day fresh and delicious, and the fruits and vegetables so fresh, tasty and mostly organic, we got so spoiled. All of these tours and restaurants were suggested and booked by the concierge! I also visited the spa for a massage and a hair service. The spa is big and beautiful, and the services were pretty good. Overall an excellent hotel and a great vacation. Congratulations to the hotel management and staff and the people behind this new concept of the hotel.

567798284,50,Amazed and Beyond Compare,"From the moment we arrived, the service and hospitality of the staff were unlike anything we had ever experienced at a resort. Our family of five had high expectations after reading all the other reviews and the Montage did not disappoint. upon arrival, we were warmly greeted by Ben with fresh leis and pineapple along with a personal tour. In the meantime, the valets brought in our luggage and put away our groceries. Our two-bedroom suite was spacious, immaculately clean and elegantly decorated. High-end appliances and granite countertops in the kitchen along with a dining table for six made eating in the suite very comfortable. We loved the large patio with a plush lounger, table, and recliners that was accessible by every room.    Throughout our stay, we were greeted by name by the staff and asked if we needed anything. Our valets, usually Chris and Rob, always asked us if we needed directions when heading out and welcomed us back warmly upon return. The minute we stepped out to the pool area, someone was there to help us with towels and finding a spot. The pictures truly do not do this pool justice. Just gorgeous!    On one morning of our vacation, we needed to head out at 3 AM to catch the sunrise at Haleakala. The valet had hot coffee and warm blankets waiting with our car. On our last day, we planned a full day of activities since we had a late flight. They let us come back after check out to use the spa facilities to clean up and shower before heading to the airport. They thought about the little details that made it so much easier for our family to truly relax and enjoy our dream vacation.

565460492,50,Fantastic Vacation,"We came to the Montage Kapalua excited to celebrate our anniversary somewhere new and beautiful. We were blown away by the experience. Five stars plus for us.    Check-In: the valet staff should have their own hotel training program for other hotels. I've never experienced such professionalism, great service, hospitality. They were so accommodating every time we ventured out. This is the first impression of a hotel and they receive five stars. Check-In was so easy, wish I remembered the gentleman's name who escorted us to our room and the woman who checked us in with towels, pineapple, and kindness.    Room: Our room was gorgeous. I've never stayed in such a nice condo. Everything you can think of in the kitchen (including martini glasses and shakers!), the place was spotless. Washer and dryer were used during the week and was such a bonus. We were in a premier oceanfront with a large lanai. Lounge chairs, outdoor dining table and six chairs I believe, and a huge round outdoor sofa that we used to read and sip coffee in the morning. We had a breathtaking view from our lanai.    Grounds: Absolutely beautiful.    Kitchen: I think next time we'd make use of the grocery delivery service. I cooked brunch each day in the room, there is a very nice set up with bbq close by. I love to cook, this was a well-equipped kitchen and I'd do more next time. We stopped at Safeway on the way in. I think there were a couple of grocery stores closer to the hotel.    Spa: I will do a separate review but the spa front desk staff were amazing. The spa is beautiful. Used it every day.    Cane and Canoe: We never ate at the restaurant but had in-room dining a few times. One night was a beautiful steak dinner. Wanted a few things not on the menu and they were very accommodating.    Concierge: Great staff here. Kind, informative, go the extra mile to help the guests. Pre-stay we corresponded with concierge by email and received great information that we used on the trip.    Pool areas: The lagoon tiered pool area, absolutely gorgeous and well staffed. We'd go out at sunset, staff offered to take photos, set up lounge chairs for best views. The pool and landscaping---beautiful.    Housekeeping: Twice a day, impeccable. I left a necklace out on the nightstand and returned and it had been placed gently in a beautiful shell. Shell is in my bathroom at home as a reminder of our time at the Montage. Coffee ran low and I called, they brought a full new set up on a tray with flowers.    To sum up, we can't wait to go back for another celebration next year. The best place to spend your anniversary.",Mar 2018,February 2018,Traveled as a couple,,"Rutherford, California"

562389538,50,A Loyal Four Seasons Client Stays at The Montage in Maui,"You can't beat the service at the Four Seasons in Maui and the food at Spago is fantastic but we just had a GREAT stay at the Montage on the other side of the island.    The property's rooms are simply superior. They are configured in 1-2-or-3 bedroom residences. 80 of them are owned by people and 50 are for the hotel. Wolf appliances, Sub-Zero fridge, a wine fridge, in-room laundry, two big TVs, a nice living room, seating for 10 outside (it was only two of us but). Let me put it this way - our whole family could MOVE IN to the 3-bedroom residence and LIVE THERE. Its that nice.    The pool was superior to most others on the island. The reason being is that they have little vignettes that maybe seated 12 people max thus there was lots of privacy. You could swim from one area to another - to another if you liked. You didn't have to hear people yapping which is nice. Pool service was pretty good as was the pool food. Expensive but good.    The property doesn't feel like a hotel and doesn't have quite as many amenities but we weren't wanting for anything.    The views SMOKED that of any room we've ever had at The Four Seasons in Maui or Kona. You could see whales right from your lanai. The overall design is just better for privacy and views.    One tip would be: stop at the local market and pick up some snacks, wine, booze or whatever you like before you get to the hotel. You will want to spend some time in the room which we did when it rained.    Spa treatments were very good although pretty pricey. The spa wasn't brand new but had lots to do if you wanted to make a day of it.    We will absolutely go back.",Feb 2018,February 2018,Traveled as a couple,,"Los Angeles, California"
561516159,10,In no way is this 5-star service,"The rooms are definitely very nice at this resort but that's about it.    The staff and service is definitely not a five-star level. Upon checking in, we weren't given ANY information about the property. Our room wasn't ready (which was fine) but we had to pry and ask to get any info on where we could store bags and hang out. They didn't even give us a map until we asked.    Beach: the beach is PUBLIC access, so it's more like a 3-star vibe. Just fair warning.    We called for a late checkout and they informed us it would be $150 for just one hour more. Keep in mind, we are paying $2,000, two THOUSAND dollars and they demand $150 for a one hour late checkout.    You would NEVER get that at other properties like Ritz Carlton.

559488448,50,Stunning...with a tiny hitch in service,"I think 4.5 stars is more accurate - but round up, right?  My stay at Montage was memorable and stunning. After researching and reading reviews, I was looking forward to top-notch service and a gorgeous environment (and relaxation and whales).    From the beginning, the people at the resort were wonderful: the valet, the person who checked us in, housekeeping, and especially the person who showed us the residence and gave us a mini tour. (I need to work on my name recall!) It really is a nice touch when greeted with smiles just walking around the resort.    The residence is beautiful and all the conveniences of home are present: laundry, full kitchen, etc. The view (had premiere ocean) was breathtaking - you could see whales from the huge lanai and even whales breaching from the bathroom window!!    The only down point during the stay was the service at the club infinity pool. I felt like I was bothering the woman working there when I approached (I do know her name, but won't publish it unless management wants it); when I asked for two chairs to be set up (for my mom and I), instead of being met with warmth (like at the main pool - and really, everywhere else), it was a curt, ""last name and room number"". No small talk or anything to make a person feel welcome - felt very awkward compared to the service experience with everyone else. I felt I was inconveniencing her. I also thought it was a bit strange to not be provided with towels (just a cover for the pool chairs); that's pretty automatic usually. When at the pool, you often swim, and then need a towel. No problem though - after swimming and enjoying the pool, I just took a towel for myself and mom, from the stand. The strange thing was this worker was very friendly with other guests at the pool (there were not that many) - so I didn't really know what to make of the experience. I honestly had more pleasant encounters when I was renting and returning my car. :)    I'm happy to say though, the rest of the service encountered during the stay, was wonderful. I think that is why this encounter just stood out more.    I do recommend this resort; 99% of the people showed exceptional service and kindness (i.e. on the way to check out, the person vacuuming smiled, waved, and wished us a nice trip home). The Montage is in a gorgeous location for hikes, good food, and whale watching. The residences are also stunning and it's hard not to feel relaxed surrounded by beauty.",Feb 2018,February 2018,Traveled with family,,

548530221,50,One of the finest hotels on the planet.,"Easily the best pool on the island of Maui, but this isn't fair to limit it to that, because everything else they are doing is reaching levels of service and hospitality that aren't really accomplished at other properties.    But the pool is so fun, and that comparison includes Hana, any of the Wailea properties (tho that Four Seasons adult pool is incredible), and possibly even the Four Seasons Lanai. They have an infinity pool on the south side of the property, which is a little more calm, and quiet. But the main pool has so many hidden spots, fun areas, waterfalls, and little places to hide and splash and play. The weather isn't always the best, but it does drive away families and the throngs of crowds that can ruin an intimate, and charming, Maui experience. If your weather isn't too your liking, a short ten minute drive to Kaanapali beach will remedy that issue.    Their staff is the definition of Aloha, and their amenities will not leave you wanting. The size of the suites is better than anything on the island, and the value (even vs an AirBnB) is not even negotiable. The amenities and how the suite is appointed is superb, and you will fall into thinking you are at your dream home, almost immediately. The kitchens are outfitted with everything, down to martini shakers and glasses, so you won't have to wont of anything, and if you do... they'll get it for you. =)    It's hard to think when we might not stay here during one of our trips. If you are worried about value, stop worrying. If you are second guessing the rate, it's because you don't really understand what they deliver, and how they execute their mission statement of pampering and making everyone feel absolutely amazing. It is very difficult to deliver luxury, and the ""concept"" of Montage, while still letting employees be themselves. You feel like Ohana here, and it's really divine. The pool area employees and bartenders are all earnest and genuine, and our favorite room service attendant is one of the highlights of our stay... she certainly rises above and beyond the call of duty with focusing on every little detail to make your meal perfect.    Their restaurant, and bars, are wonderful. We were really surprised by Cane and Canoe, both dinner and breakfast. We had made a culinary trip of this vacation, with Star Noodle, Sansei, and Lahaina Grill, which was our mistake... we should have eaten dinner at the restaurant a few more times.    The Spa is one of the most beautiful I have ever seen, and the intentional design and layout is one of the most operationally pleasant I've ever experienced. I also had not only one of my best massages here, but I also had one of the most stimulating philosophical conversations I have ever had with my therapist, and it is something that will reverberate for the rest of my life. That's how you know someone is doing hospitality right... it isn't about a few nights in a bed, but an experience that will alter your life, and something that you learn from, and carry with you for the rest of your life. I highly recommend visiting the spa just to use the facilities... they have a private area, and a co-ed area, so bring your partner and relax in a quieter atmosphere if the pool gets too busy.    The nearby trail walks and hikes are fantastic, and it's likely one of the most romantic places I have ever seen. In fact, search for Montage and ""The Oldest Pier"", which has the production quality of a movie, and will possibly move you to tears... it really delivers precisely what Montage Kapalua is accomplishing. It's a place that will immediately capture you, and you'll be figuring out how to save and come back time and time again.",Dec 2017,December 2017,Traveled on business,the view rooms are worth it!,"Tiburon, California"

546059060,50,Montage Maui magic!,"This was the second time we were fortunate enough to be invited by the in-laws to stay at the Montage, Maui. It was great last year and even better the second time around!    The resort is on an incredible piece of land featuring a wonderful snorkeling beach on one end and a really cool natural habitat on the other. The spot is so private and quiet not at all the normal touristy feel of Maui making this a great place to relax. Did I mention the short walk to Merriman's? That is one of the best restaurants on the island.    My tip is to come in late October as hotel occupancy is typically quite low. At that time of year the pools are empty and the service team is relaxed and on point. Not having to fight for a good pool chair is a wonderful thing.    There is a small bar at the beach pool. My only criticism is that the menu is lacking options. After a week we were struggling to eat the same items over and over. Perhaps they can upgrade that offering over time.    In the evening make sure to stop by the Cane and Canoe bar. When you do, make sure to say hello to Carrie from her friend Jim from Chicago. She is the consummate professional and if you tell her what you like she will be glad to make you a tasty concoction.    The condos we stayed in were amazing units. It was a very large three bedroom with ample space for our group of 4 adults and three kids. The finishes are top notch and after several years are wearing quite well. Cooking dinner there is a great option as the kitchens are well stocked with appropriate cookware etc. All in all Montage is a great place to stay and excellent way to relax and enjoy some time in Maui.

543596321,40,"Great Resort, But a Few Small Problems","We stayed here for a week as a family of six over Thanksgiving. The resort grounds, pools, rooms, etc., were all beautiful. The staff is very professional and courteous. They do a great job being kid friendly while also maintaining a relaxing environment for adults. The rooms are spacious and first class. The valet team was outstanding, always making sure we had a supply of towels and water in the car every time we left the resort on an excursion. I would have given the resort a 5 star rating, but there were a couple small issues. First, the toilets in two bathrooms were broken when we first checked-in. Second, there was a problem with the directv in one of the bedrooms. They quickly sent people to fix them, but the directv never fully worked in the second bedroom. These were relatively small issues but when you're paying top dollar you expect everything to work with no problems. The wait staff by the pool area was good, but sometimes it appeared that they were a bit understaffed.

The last time we were there was in November 2015 with my father, who we lost suddenly this January. As a tribute, we all decided to return to the last spot we got to enjoy on holiday with him and to make sure we create new memories and celebrate his life after everything he has done for us.    I can honestly say that the management and staff at the resort created the most amazing vacation that my dad would have wanted. The condos were clean as usual, large and spacious and all had unbelievable ocean views. The staff were always attentive, professional, and accommodating with all requests from our large 13 person party. A special shout out to Ayami in concierge who gave us perfect recommendations for dinners, activities, and advice. I truly don't know that we could have had such a flawless transition of events if it wasn't for her.    The hotel and staff will always hold a special place in my heart and my memories and, after seeing a shooting star on our lanai the first night while sipping my wine, I can honestly say my dad agrees.

540171797,50,Amazing family vacation in Paradise,"Our family has just returned home from another stay at the Beautiful Montage Kapalua.  It was the most WONDERFUL time ever....  There are so many reasons why I think this resort is amazing, but I think the number one reason is the staff is constantly going above and beyond, for every single moment of your stay.  Not only is this resort a beautiful, upscale and lovely property, and IMPECCABLY clean, it is ran like a well oiled machine. Not one detail was missed or was not to our liking during our 8 day stay. We were so excited to take our son (8) and our daughter, who was celebrating her 12th birthday!  Everyone treated our whole family like royalty and there were so many different wonderful instances that occurred during our trip it would be difficult to name them all.  When we arrived at the resort, our first interaction with any staff was with Justice at the valet bell desk. He opened our car doors and excitedly and exuberantly greeted us so warmly, our kids thought we were old friends with him. He assured us they would unload all our luggage and deliver it to our room and we were whisked away by the lovely Whitney in Conceirge to check in.  Let me tell you about check in at the Montage.  It’s like going to the spa.  After a warm greeting, you immediately begin to feel the Aloha spirit as you bend down, and they place a Lei of flowers around your neck.  Then you are immediately invited to sit and relax on the small sofas scattered throughout their amazing lobby, with the stunning chalet style roof, sunny breezes wafting through from the ocean, and the most stunning vista in the world straight ahead.  We were given warm towels that smelled of lavender to freshen our hands and faces and then served delicious Maui Gold pineapple........ our children were delighted when they were offered to pick something special from the toy wagon that sits in the lobby by Conceirge......  It’s filled with delightful little stuffed animals, sea creatures and such and some children’s books by a local author.  Soon after we arrived in our Grand Residence, and after being shown around by Whitney, we were left to bask in the joy of settling in to Paradise!  Our 8 year old son looked at me and said “Mom, this was the warmest welcome I’ve ever felt in my life coming to a place like this!” (Might I mention he is a seasoned traveler tho still young!)  I could go on all day about everything I love about the Montage... but for the sake of time I must keep it short.  Nick and Henry at the pool bar were simply outstanding! Not only were the drinks they served wonderful, they did their whole job with such joy and fun spirit. They did so many extra, awesome things for our children, teaching them how to cut pineapples, telling them stories about diving and fishing, letting them use their binoculars to look out in the bay for whales.....all while keeping a close eye on their actual job of starting drink tickets and putting in food orders....it was amazing!  Our family had many meals at Cane & Canoe and every single time the food was delicious, and presented beautifully...... the servers were professional and prompt, and they were ever attentive to our needs.  Our kids fell in love with Lindsay and her beautiful, ever present smile.  The Wine sommelier (I’m embarrassed I forgot his name) was outstanding, traveling around the tables throughout the dinner service, answering questions and giving advice.    We also did a family photo shoot with Pacific dream Photograhy! It was simple, easy and FUN!  Tiffany was outstanding and she knew exactly what she was doing....By the next morning when we met for our viewing, she somehow had managed to make us a video with music set to it already and with a mixture of still and Live Photo’s!  I was shocked!  It’s the most precious keepsake I will ever have.    I will close my review with this being said, the Montage Kapalua Bay has captured the true meaning of Aloha, when you are there, the warmth and love and hospitality all around you settles into your soul, and you never want to leave.

539247181,50,First Class,"We had an excellent time at the Montage. It is a beautiful property, is impeccably maintained, and the service couldn't be better. We had a one bedroom premier ocean view room and the view was wonderful. One note on this, however - you are back somewhat from the ocean. You don't have the ocean a stone's throw out your window. But, the view is still magnificent. And you also view the beautiful center area of the resort where there are several pools. The pools are nestled amongst palm trees and they snake and wind around giving swimmers lots of privacy. There are also in-ground hot tubs/pools. We ate at the hotel's fine dining restaurant (Cane and Canoe) two nights (having the ""Fish of the Moment"") because we liked it so much. It can compete with the best on the island. The room was huge and had a kitchen, living area, and an enormous balcony. I mean huge. We were on a corner and the balcony was almost as big as the inside area. The hotel has its own beach and you can get snorkel gear and an umbrella (I think they were both free) and other items for the beach there. The ocean there is within a protected area so the snorkeling awesome and there are lots of fish. The staff almost guarantees (not really, but close) that you'll see a turtle. I did come face to face with one in water that was less than 6 feet deep and the turtle hung around for a while giving me plenty of time to admire it. The staff....I can't say enough. They are professional, helpful, and very friendly. They just about wait on you hand-and-foot and it's always done with a smile that appears genuine. I don't know how many rooms they have or how booked they were when we were there...but, we felt like we had the place to ourselves. It's a very big property so you're not going to feel crowded at all. One last thing....that part of the island is breezy at night and, depending on the location of your room, the wind can be powerful. It's not loud and won't keep you up at night but it's best described by a conversation I had with one of the staff. We both laughed hard when I told her that when I opened the front door, I thought I would be sucked out. That's about the worst thing I can say about the Montage and that's really nothing. You can always nit-pick things at a hotel but to do that with the Montage would be doing a disservice to everything it has going for it. It is a fabulous place to stay and they treat you like royalty.

536513228,50,Breathtaking views; Spectacular service; Incredible pools,"It's hard to summarize all the reasons this property is great but it all starts with that view of the Pacific from the lobby, overlooking the pools. The grounds at this resort are amazing....lots of wide open spaces, grass, local plants, palms, etc. The main pool area has several areas where you can sit and feel like it's just you at the pool due to how well the areas are arranged (unlike other hotels where you are lined up in rows right by the pool and have to hold a chair at 9am). As you approach the pool, you are greeted by attendants bringing you towels, ice water, etc. And if you go to the beach, they'll put out beach chairs and towels for you. It's a great snorkeling bay (stay to right side and you'll likely see turtles). For happy hour, walk to Merrimans or Napili Kai or stay on property. Great trails for morning walks north of the hotel. We loved the gym and worked out every day. Excellent equipment and clean and well appointed spa facilities. Loved our condo (bldg. 5 top floor) and couldn't stop commenting on the beautiful view. There is a smaller pool near bldg. 5 that is also very nice if you just want to lounge by a pool or use the Jacuzzi. Loved Montage!

Never have I had concierge come up to show us around the room and show us how to work the DVR either. That's just how great the place is. The grounds are fantastic with turtles snoozing nearby. The bay near the hotel was one of the best snorkeling spots we tried. We saw fishes and turtles.

All I can say is that my family of 5, including a 7 month old, have never felt so welcomed, appreciated and cared for as guests anywhere else. The resort was very clean, beautifully organized with a generous supply of chaises and towels available at the many gorgeous pools and at the adjacent beach. The suites were clean, luxurious and updated with the Ocean View having a true and lovely ocean view from the expansive lanai (in comparison to some reviews of ‘Ocean View’ accommodations at other resorts).  All the beautiful surroundings were complimented by the phenomenal staff. Some examplesl:  • the valets, who were always pleasant, helpful and prompt, jump-started my son’s rental car and charged the battery without even being asked when the Budget rental died 12 hours after he arrived.  • Concierge Anna who, when I told her I was unwell, called the staffs of the beach, upper and lower pools to locate my family whom I was trying to join so that I wouldn’t have to walk all over looking for them  • when I explained to Anna the reason I was unwell was due to getting gluten at Frida’s Beach House the day before, she was so concerned she emailed the owners about the server who had refused to let me speak to the chef and claimed she ‘knew 'all about celiac’ and would take care of me. Very recognizable symptoms of gluten exposure began shortly after the meal and lasted for days. Thanks to Anna, the server was being retrained & I was offered free lunch (which I declined).  • Concierge Misti worked patiently with my son to set up various enjoyable off-site activities (zip line, golf, horseback riding and deep sea fishing) that enriched our vacation experience.  • Chef Robert at Cane and Canoe, the hotel restaurant, took the time to speak with me before each of the two dinners we had there and made sure I had a meal that was safe and delicious. Such a relief after getting ‘glutened’ at Frida’s.  • Reservations agent Ahlea who made sure that we got the best rates and locations for our two family suites which were located just one floor away from each other—important when caring for a 7 month old.  • the members of the pool staffs who were uniformly friendly, caring and helpful; unfortunately, I did not get names but one staffer was kind enough to hold and comfort my sobbing grandson while we tried to gather all our things and get him into his stroller to return to his parents.

After staying at other Montage properties, we knew we would be in for a treat, but we were still surprised at how nice the property is.    We stayed in room 4401. The higher the floor, the more you see of the ocean. It's worth the extra cash. The suites are truly spacious and posh. The lanai was huge. Best of all - quiet. Lots of quiet places and space between you and other guests. In the hustle and bustle of most places in Maui, this truly felt like a retreat.    The pool area is grand and large.... lots of places to go to feel secluded. We especially liked the canopies - the extra cost is well worth the location and privacy. Lubi (not sure if I spelled her name correctly) was an awesome part of our two days poolside.    The sunsets from the lawn are your normal Maui (read: extraordinary) sunsets. I do wish there were more chairs or benches scattered around from which to watch the sunset or listen to the ocean later at night.    The service at Montage properties is always what sets it apart. The staff is consistent from day to day and remember your name, your preferences, etc. The bellmen and valet staff was very helpful with directions and making us feel at home.    The only issue we had was with ANTS all over the kitchen. We could not leave any food out or it was covered, and it kept us from cooking much in our room (which was well stocked if we had wanted to do so).

We went with the montage and after staying there for a week AND visiting the ritz and four seasons I am delighted we did. In brief, the rooms are expansive with amazing views of Molokai, the staff is world class and the pool and grounds the most awe inspiring we have ever seen. We travelled without our children and this resort offered the most peaceful experience. The ritz and four seasons, while beautiful, are packed with people, large family groups in particular and to put it simply are a complete zoo. At montage there was no morning battle for beach chairs or pool space, or screaming kids next to you at a $250 dinner (we love kids, have 5, just wanted a break). Only negative at montage is that kapalua beach is quite small and packed with people most days. There are several quieter beaches nearby I would suggest.    Other quick Maui tips: rent a car, a Jeep--we did lots of driving excursions. Do the road to Hana , but do the complete circle. The road past Hana is the best part although they seem to try to discourage you from taking that route. Eat at the barefoot cafe in Hana bay for lunch- get the tuna poke and pork lunch plate. Best food we are the whole time by a long shot!!!",Aug 2017,August 2017,Traveled as a couple,,"Columbia, South Carolina"

Four bathrooms, great living room, dining room, superb kitchen, laundry room and even an office. We had three terraces with direct access out to the well-kept lawn.  The apartment including the kitchen and outdoor grill was well equipped with everything that you need. Nice decor. Great housekeeping and room service. Free and quite fast wifi.  The pools of the Montage are really extraordinary. The most beautiful and most varied multi-level pool area that we have ever seen. Superbly kept. Beautiful plantations. Simply awesome.

504935497,50,Family trip,This is a wonderful piece of the world. The Montage will give you a warm welcome and get you settled quickly.    We had a two bedroom suite overlooking the pool and ocean. The accommodations were top notch with most everything you would need to cook in the kitchen. The rooms were spacious and the outside space spanned the entire length. There is a supermarket close to the hotel that you can drive to.    Staff very attentive and accommodating. We had just one meal at the pool during our stay. It was pretty good. We avoided the main restaurant as it seemed overpriced and didn't get good reviews. The only negative was that you need to valet your car.

503907833,50,Hawaii's Best Property,"We have stayed at every luxury property in Hawaii and I believe this one is probably the best. Not only is it the best value (compare a 2 bedroom garden view for about $1,100 a night to a garden room at the Fur Seasons for about $750 a night), but they had the best service. Pool attendants always ensured we were comfortable. The size of the resort is quite intimate, ensuring that corporate reward trips did not take over the resort. Note that the next door property (the Ritz) was inundated with drunk business employees running all over the place. All in all a fabulous place that you can't go wrong at. My only recommendation to this property is to get rid of the ""rule"" that you cannot bring your own food to the pool. I suffer from a genetic disorder where I need to eat certain foods at certain times of the day. These foods I must consume are not offered at the pool. My family still ordered food at the pool and tipped the servers. I think it was just tacky to tell me to eat my yogurt somewhere else while my family was eating the lunches they ordered from pool service at the pool. To send me back to the room to eat my yogurt was a bit ridiculous.",Jul 2017,May 2017,Traveled with family,,los angeles

Second, the staff at the Montage go above and beyond to give you personalized service. It was my 40th birthday and I brought my family of young kids to celebrate. This resort left a lasting impression. What I like most is that resort has areas to tuck away for peace and quiet as well as areas for families to enjoy. From checkin until checkout the resort staff did many little things to personalize our stay. They had personalized lei greetings. They had a canoe full of stuffed animals and toys for my kids. They had a personalized poster in the suite. It's really the small details that makes this resort stand out from the rest. The list goes on and on.

501921408,50,Just a fabulous retreat from beginning to end,"We arrived at the Montage at mid afternoon on Monday. From that moment on our week was a magical escape. The staff at the entry take care of all details. We were escorted to our room on this magnificent property. We had a two bedroom, 3 bathroom suite with full kitchen, living room, dining area with full amenities. The large balcony has chairs, a table, and a circular sofa. I wish I had taken a picture of it to remember how it spoke the words......relax and feel pampered. Our first evening we had a cocktail party at the Cliff House with the sun setting and mai tais. The staff at the Montage are flawless. We were greeted on the grounds twice by the hotel manager, Anthony Freda. Both occasions we could only report that the Montage was absolutely our most enjoyable Maui experience in the 30 years we have been coming. On our last evening our group had dinner planned with the event planner under a tent. The staff and the event planner were beyond attentive and the manager, Mr Freda offered to take our picture as we'd were walking down to dinner. I was taking a picture of my husband looking at the ocean and he kindly offered to snap a picture of us both. The memorable hospitality of the Montage was consistent from the moment we arrived. The staff to deliver cars were so fast we never waited even one moment. The housekeeping was quietly at work making the room comfortable and manicured. Every staff person was helpful and kind and the property is maintained with the greatest care and efficiency. The Montage is where hospitality begins and our most memorable Maui visit. Now I can only return to the Montage.",Jul 2017,June 2017,Traveled on business,,"San Francisco, California"
501641036,30,Bit surprised and disappointed.,"Firstly, we are fairly well traveled, and this was our fourth island to visit in Hawaii. I must say we had several bizarre and unsettling experiences led to the 3/5 rating. Well, lets get to it.  In random order.  1) The food --- Cane and Canoe is this well-advertised 'top notch' restaurant. Dinner was just not good. We as a family were most surprised by this. I dont mind paying a premium at a nice resort, I expect to. I really do not even mind if the food is good but not great. However, the food was just bleh for lack of a better word. I discovered upon my return, that I am not alone in this assessment of the restaurant.  2) My son stepping on a rusty needle. That sentence sums it up a bit. Just walking on the grassy knoll of Montage property, he steps on a big long rusty needle. Was a bit traumatic, and involved some tears. The staff offered to call a doctor and gave him a sprite. Now... I assumed we would hear from someone. A manager perhaps? someone, about this. We even joked the resort is probably terrified we may sue. But not to worry, nobody checked on him. Nobody asked us a thing, at all, zippo. Little surprised by that.  3) The unusual breakfast altercation. We showed up for breakfast at Cane and Canoe, and there was a 15 minute wait. We said no biggie, and sat off to the side in the lanai area. 15 minutes later a large group shows up, and an aggressive mom we can overhear complaining about the wait and not wanting to wait. Few more minutes go by, and we see them being sat at a table. Wow, we did not like that. So I came to the seating lady, and she explained that they were walking to our table, so she sat them at a different prepared table... When I asked why not just explain they are not ready, and seat my family as we were there first. She said, ""well do you still want your table?"". Super sassy and super surprised again. We were very classy about it, we had waited 20 minutes, we were absolutely seated after a large party that did came after us. Additionally, that large party, because they were seated first, ordered, had drinks, and had service long before we were even greeted by a waiter. Never had that experience at what I thought was a high end resort.    Positives - The valet area and those guys are awesome, top notch. More of what I had expected. Hawaii, the scenery, the grounds, (aside from a needle), were great.",Jul 2017,July 2017,Traveled with family,,"Houston, Texas"
500968457,50,"Montage, relaxing...even for parents with small children","We decided to try out the Montage this year, event hough we usually stay in south Maui. We were nervous about the weather, but it ended up being perfect over July 4th week! Montage is the PERFECT set up for families. We had a two bedroom suite, with a full kitchen, living room, and HUGE lanai. If my baby was napping, we could all easily relax on the daybed outside watching the ocean. The pools were quite nice, with a large shallow end for small children. Beach access was also close and it was beautiful.  We really enjoyed the food at Cane and Canoe. They had lots of options for the kids, plus delicious food for the adults to enjoy as well. The service was exceptional at the hotel. Room service came immediately when we needed our broken coffee pot replaced or extra waters, etc. The valets were also really great. The only snafu we had was turn down coming in really late one night after we had all gone to sleep. It was definitely a bit spooky waking up to someone in the room! We made sure to put a ""no calls, etc. after 8pm"" clause on our room account after that :)    The main reasons I think this resort is perfect for families:  -Large suites with kitchen to cook your own food  -Family friendly restaurant/meals  -Kid friendly pools  -Since it is a smaller resort, there were never any crowds or battles to get chairs by the pool  -Small touches, like books and stuffed animals for the kids, etc.    We are definitely going to go back to Montage next year.",Jul 2017,July 2017,Traveled with family,Go with an ocean view...,"San Ramon, California"

The spa is awesome with an amazing array of yoga, fitness and Pilates classes. The pool is the best I've ever seen and the resort setting might make you cry when you first walk inside.

We split our trip up, one week being at the Montage and the following 2 weeks being at the Four Seasons...which I *thought would be the pinnacle of the trip...  However, when we checked in, we were told to leave our vehicle, they drove it to the room and parked the car for us. No checking in at a front desk, we were whisked directly to the room. We were UPGRADED, complimentary of course to a 3 bdrm, 3 1/2 bath residence, which was unbelievable. It literally took our breath away.    Everyone we met said ""Aloha"" and smiled. The food was excellent. Customer Service was excellent. Pool service was excellent. They were on spot the entire time. And lastly, the room was immaculate. VERY clean and I'm a little picky about that.  Montage ended up being the pinnacle of the trip!    I tell everyone, go to Montage.

498956054,50,Still Tops on Maui for Luxury Vacation,"This is our third stay at the Montage and once again it did not disappoint. Here are the highlights…    What’s Amazing:    • If you appreciate a more tranquil environment for your vacation Montage is perfection. The hotel only has 50 residences (3 bedroom condos that are available as 1, 2 or 3 bedroom units – they just lock the doors to the rooms that you’re not using). It’s part of a larger development that has another 50 or 75 residences - so all total just around 100 condos/homes share a very large pool and common area.  • Since they have a small number of homes/condos there are a lot fewer people. So no rush to the pool to secure your lounges for the day – there are always plenty available. No waits to get into the restaurant – there’s always a table. And just generally a relaxing atmosphere that isn’t “dead” but it’s not frenetic either.  • The residences themselves are beautiful – high ceilings, hardwood floors throughout, except the bedrooms which are carpeted and very nice high end furnishing. 70 inch flat screen in the living room that we never turn on. Plus TVs in the bedrooms. All the kitchen appliances are Subzero, Wolfe and the like so it’s top of the line all the way. Large master bath with tub and shower. Plus a half bath in the entryway if you need additional coverage or have a larger group. if I’m not mistaken at least 2 out of the 3 bedrooms have tub, shower and two sinks in the attached bathroom. Most importantly they have a washer and a dryer – a complete necessity once you get used to it.  • Service is personal and attentive without being over the top. I get somewhat uncomfortable if folks pay too much attention to me and I only that that feeling a couple times on this trip. In general the staff takes an interest, which seems very genuine, in what you’re doing and how they can make your vacation more enjoyable.  • Made it to the spa and fitness center for the first time on this trip. Although I didn’t use any space services I did walk around and it’s amazing. The gym is large enough with plenty of brand new cardio equipment, free weights and also machines. Like everything at the resort – never crowded when I used it.  • The beach, Kapalua Bay Beach, is no more than a 3 minute walk from anywhere at the resort. They have umbrellas, lounges, towels, snorkels plus anything else you need for the beach all for reasonable additional charges. The guys there are very generous on the amount of time you can use the items without added fees. I rented a paddle board and he said “it’s a Hawaiian hour” so take your time. They set everything up for you and they even have an ice cream freezer with a variety of treats that our daughter loved.  • Our daughter went to Paintbox which is the kid’s club for the first time on this visit. We like to go on our vacation to be together as a family but she loved it and it gave us some time to do things as a couple. The programs are very well planned and all activities are tied to the area – not just coloring or playing at the pool (they do a little of that too though.) They picked Plumeria and made leis. They painted coconuts and my daughter learned things about Hawaii in the process. Absolutely top notch program worth every penny.  • Dining at Cane and Canoe was very good the night we ate there. There are kids in the restaurant but I wouldn’t call it overly kid friendly. She had more fun in other places either in Kapalua or Lahaina. They have live music every night and the view is amazing. Great for adult dining. Average for dining with the kiddos IMO.  • We also had room service many mornings. Food is delicious and the servers are lots of fun to chat with as you start your day    Things To Know or That Could Be Better:    • Sure it’s expensive - $1500 a night and up. On one hand it’s hard/impossible to rationally justify this kind of expense and on the other once you experience the place you talk yourself into doing it again. The value is there but you have to appreciate space, peace and quiet, top-notch service and so on.  • We had some rain this trip but so did Lahaina, which is rare. I’ve read reviews on here that complain about the “rainy side of the island” - after staying here for 3 weeks in total that’s just not a worry. Every day it rained we also had plenty of sun and the majority of the days were almost too hot for some portion of the time we were outside. Don’t let location discourage you.  • This is REALLY nit picky but some furnishings could use more aggressive replacement. Our marble coffee table had rings and spills from acidic liquids that were easily visible. And it also had some chips out of the edges. The stove had one burner that was discolored for some reason. These did not stand out on first impression but you noticed them and I would fix them in my own home. I would not mention this anywhere but here where rates are so amazingly high - you sort of expect things to be nearly perfect.  • Housekeeping is amazing when they clean your room (super kind and efficient) but they come at unpredictable times – usually different times each day. Sometimes in the morning and sometimes in the afternoon for the primary service. Early in the trip we were on west coast time and they came for evening turn down after we were in bed at around 8:20. Partly my problem for not putting out the privacy sign but also a bit late knowing we have a 5 year-old and are on west coast time.    I’m a very hard grader when I’m spending this much money so don’t let the 4 items above discourage you from coming here. It’s an incredible vacation if only once in lifetime. Perfect place for multiple generations of the family. They do an incredible job, with a true aloha spirit from top-to-bottom – perfection is in sight at this amazing resort.",Jul 2017,July 2017,Traveled with family,,"San Diego, California"
498371473,50,Absolutely Incredible!,"We stayed here in the summer of 2016. The hotel is the old Ritz Carlton (I believe), and the rooms are more like a home than a hotel room.    The experience begins as you drive onto the property. Heavily covered in beautiful trees, you really have arrived in paradise. We couldn't believe how nice the room was when we showed up! We had a half bath, as well as a full laundry unit. Not to mention the large kitchen, living room, deck, and master bed/bath.    Housekeeping comes twice daily, and the entire experience was nothing short of amazing. Breakfast at the hotel was one of the highlights from our trip (try the Local Rice Bowl!), and the staff was so accommodating.

495156474,50,A Beautiful Wedding and Vacation at the Montage,"My daughter wanted a destination wedding with only immediate family in attendance. We talked to people and did an internet search and decided on the Montage Kapalua Bay. There were 13 of us in three different condos. The wedding was at the Cliff House and included dinner at the Cliff House as well. We all had a fabulous time and many in our party said this was a 5 star hotel with 10 star service. Whether we needed our car, or special laundry soap, or a drink at the pool, or had a question, the staff was attentive and ready to serve. After the first night I called Housekeeping because the bed was too hard. The Manager arrived with a foam pad for the bed and it was perfect. We purchased the Cliff House Package for the Wedding and Chi was wonderful. We communicated with her for about a year before we finally arrived in Maui. She provided answers to questions, menu options, flower options, wedding cake options, and anything else we could think of. She referred us to a couple of photographers and we picked Scott. They were even able to make a groom's cake to go along with the wedding cake. The weather was perfect all week and we can't wait to go back. If you are looking for a place to have a destination wedding, this is the place for you. They only have one wedding a day so you do not feel like you are at a wedding factory. While we were there we saw one other wedding with about 40 guests on the grounds and with a tent for dinner out on the grounds. The pools are fabulous and the staff at the pool is wonderful. The food is also very good. Don't pass this place up because it is not a well know or big chain. It is absolutely fabulous.

Montage is very pricey, but we got a very good deal through Costco's Travel program. The resort has great pools and a nice beachfront that is actually adjacent to the property. You can get free umbrellas. towels, and chairs though on the beach from a third party group located on the beach. you can also rent kayaks, paddleboards and snorkeling gear and have it charged to your room. The service at the resort was outstanding. Every staff member is courteous and helpful. Housekeeping did a great job and came by twice a day. The restaurant has a great breakfast and very good dinner menu though both are very pricey (as is most of Maui). Service by the pool was excellent and very attentive compared to other resorts. The whole area is beautiful and the views from the resort are unmatched. The only downside was that that the beach area is very rocky and coral is only 10-15 feet out from shore so it is not a great beach for swimming or body surfing. It is very good for snorkeling though. Highly recommend!",Jun 2017,June 2017,,,"Marietta, Georgia"

That is the number one reason that we will never return to their resort - I put this complaint in a review that the resort wanted us to fill out and no one bothered to follow up with us.

We then were escorted to a beautiful suite with a breathtaking view of the hotel property and the ocean! Two bedroom premier ocean view was just perfect! The rooms were spacious with ample closet space. It looked impeccable and smelled nice too! During our 6 days stay, we did not encounter one unpleasantry.

Sitting on the Lanai every morning and looking at the blue ocean was therapeutic. The room,4504, was a Premier Ocean view. It was overwhelmingly large and super quiet. Anna, our concierge, made sure everything was perfect. It was our anniversary and the Resort had the most unique cake made out of towels waiting in our room. They then delivered a real cake that almost lasted the whole stay. Another employee that really was amazing was Vanessa from the Valet desk.

487455945,40,Beautiful surroundings for a restful vacation,"We had a great stay here at the Montage. The staff was not only professional but delivered outstanding service. They made you feel special from checking in to picking up your car from the valet. In fact, after the 2nd day, I didn't even need to give them my name or room number, the valet team just knew our family. That's service!    Even before the trip, about a month prior to arrival, the concierge, Ayami, emailed me to inquire of our stay and provide information regarding restaurants and activities. It was very informative and super helpful! She was great to correspond with and quick to reply to any questions.    We had a 2 bedroom suite which was very spacious with a nice modern design. The appliances were fantastic. We actually did have a problem with the dryer and they replaced the whole thing! That's amazing responsiveness!    The grounds are gorgeous with the perfect landscape to wake up to each morning. The pool is fantastic with a separate serenity pool for adults.    You are only about a 2 minute walk from the beach. Hotel staff will set up lounge chairs and an umbrella, if you wish. The beach is gorgeous and you can snorkel right there since the reef is right off the beach. We were able to see so many fish and even a sea turtle!    Now for some of the not so great stuff...    There is one big negative; we reserved a Canopy Bed for the day which cost $300. It is waaayyy overpriced and we looked under the bed because of dropping an item and discovered how disgusting it was. There was a bunch of trash under it. It looked like it hadn't been cleaned in quite some time. That was disappointing when you paid extra for the bed which brought little benefit. I would recommend to skip the Canopy Bed and simple grab a couple of lounge chairs; they are free and the staff will set up a towel for you.    Another negative was their business center...it was laughable at best. For a hotel in this range, it should be much better. It's basically in what seems like a closet and cords are everywhere.    Also, their Wi-Fi is a bit sketchy. I am in IT so I always have a tendency to pay close attention to the hotel's Wi-Fi setup. They had a mish mash of different vendors including consumer equipment which inevitably led to subpar Wi-Fi. Hotels in this class should use enterprise grade equipment for seamless Wi-Fi.    There is a $30 daily valet parking charge along with a daily $40 resort fee. I would rather they charge a little extra for the price rather than hit you with these daily fees but that seems to be the norm in Hawaii.    Overall, this was a great stay. I would highly recommend and I would definitely stay again when I return to Maui. Also, the Cane and Canoe restaurant is delicious albeit pricey and offers amazing views. Don't miss it!

When we were leaving to drive to the Sheraton one of the staff members said to us, ""most customers leave to get sun because we are on the rainy side of the island."" Sorry, excuse me? We pay over $4500 a night to get rain and have to leave the hotel? No, never again.    The food was average. The first day we got there we ordered food to the pool and it was seriously incredible.

Only con: we left our infant son's blanket behind in the room when we checked out. Our fault, 100%. Only realized it when we arrived at the airport and it was too late.

479780824,40,Beautiful Resort...,"We stayed here a few weeks ago (April 2017) and it was such a beautiful resort. When you walk in you are greeted with a lei and it is such a beautiful entry way when you park. We were walked to our room which was very nicel. It has a elevator that leads up to your floor level which your room is the only one there. When we walked in we were amazed by the space! There was so much room - It included a guest bathroom, a full kitchen, washer/dryer, huge master which included a tub/bath and my favorite part was the balcony! Wow it was so big and roomy.    The downfall was we had paid for a ocean view room and ours was more like a pool view with trees in the way. When we went to the master bedroom there was a baby crib with a gift inside of it - We don't have any kids so it felt like we were in the wrong room possibly? Hence the view or maybe they had changed their room because of the view as well? We are not one to call and complain but I figured it wouldn't hurt to ask for a different room and I wish we never did. We waited for a few hours for management to come show us a new room which was available. It took a while since it was waiting to be cleaned..although it was a better view I still wouldn't call it ocean view - definitely a partial. The valet, room service and servers were all great. After the whole ordeal with the room change we felt a different vibe from management - We requested late check out at 12 since our flight was at 4 and got denied by management even though check in is at 3 or 4 I believes.

474786614,50,Outstanding all-suite resort on Maui,"We stayed at Montage Kapalua Bay in April 2017. A 5-star hotel in every sense, the hotel is relaxing, serene and private. It is certainly one of the best resorts in all of Maui.    We stayed in an ocean front suite. The rooms look better in person than in their pictures. Ours was a 3 bed, 3.5 bath apartment (all rooms with ensuite baths + 1 powder), full kitchen with stainless steel appliances and Sub Zero fridge, dining area, living room, washer/dryer, and very large balcony with chaises and lounging bed. The suite had 3 bedrooms, and the hotel unlocks as many bedrooms as you reserve. Furnishings were in new condition, beds were very comfortable, and bathrooms were master baths with separate tub/shower, twin sinks, separate toilet, stone tile and counters throughout. All rooms and living spaces are very spacious. If you take all 3 bedrooms, the whole unit feels like a 2,500 sq ft house (not sure how many sq ft it actually is). Housekeeping is twice daily (morning and turn down), thorough, on-time, and they honor your requests every time. We were very pleased with the quality of the housekeeping. Air conditioning system is very comfortable, it's the kind where you can barely hear it running (not the loud engine in your face AC). You will not be disappointed with the room.    Main restaurant Cane & Canoe is quite good. We had breakfast and dinner there and were pleased with the food, service, and location each time we went. The tables are set in a semi enclosed area facing the ocean. A very relaxing place to have breakfast in the morning, or wind down at the hotel at the end of your day.    The resort pool is actually 3 (maybe 4) pools stacked one on top of another like a staircase. Lots of rock features, water falls, places where there are bubbles to keep everyone interested. Most areas are 3-4 ft, a couple are 5 ft deep so kid friendly. Pool service is outstanding - little treats are brought by every 45 mins or so, and the poolside dining service is great. We had no problems securing chaises to lounge on at anytime of the day. It is very spread out and there always are plenty of places. I never felt crowded in and the pool attendants are very good at helping you to find a place you like and setting it up for you.    There are two beaches near this hotel - Kapalua Bay and Oneloa Beach. Kapalua Bay is the one closest to the hotel, just 5 mins walk from the main building where the concierge is. This beach is west facing, and since the currents come from the north in the winter/spring months, we didn't get as many currents as the beaches facing north. Even so, it got a little choppy at this beach depending on the day. Your best bet is to get into the water early in the morning because the waves get stronger as the day goes on. I am told the water here is calm as a lake in the summer months.  There is a lot to see in the water at Kapalua Bay - we saw sea turtles (one sunning itself on the beach) and all sorts of tropical fish. The best place to snorkel is on the right side of the beach, closest to the hotel. Although this is a public beach (all beaches in HI are), there is a beach crew that mans about 10 pairs of beach chairs and umbrellas for Montage guests. Both times we went in the morning around 10AM, there were only 1 or 2 pairs of chairs left so it gets crowded rather quickly. It's a pretty crowded beach in general because it's a good place to snorkel and there are other hotels nearby. The other beach, Oneloa Beach, is towards the right side of the hotel. It's a small and mostly flat hike through a bird sanctuary, maybe 10 mins, to get to it. Although not great for snorkeling for the time of year we went, this was a good body board / surfing beach with lots of waves. It's also a great sandcastle beach because a good portion of the beach lies beyond the high tide line (unlike Kapalua Bay). I don't recommend letting beginner swimmers or young children get too far into the water at this beach, especially later in the day in the winter/spring. The currents can be stronger than you expect. There are NO LIFE GUARDS at either beach, so watch your children.    The hotel is located in Kapalua which is on the west side of Maui and far away from most of the big crowds (except for Kapalua Bay). This is the place to be if you want some peace and quiet and don't want to wait in line for anything. The downside is that it is further away from attractions like Hana and the Crater, but it's not that big of a deal if you have a rental car (which most people do). From Montage to the Crater is about 2 hrs to the top which was manageable. Doing the drive to Hana from the Montage seems a little more challenging, and I did not attempt it this time. There is a road that goes from the Montage north all the way around the top of the island to Kahului. It is a nice drive, similar to the road to Hana in that there are lots of twists and turns and things to see. The biggest difference is that the foliage on the western part of Maui is dryer, whereas going to Hana the plant life is more tropical.    A point worth mentioning is that if you take 1 or 2 bedrooms, both rooms will have king size beds. There is no option for 2 twins in one of the rooms, which would be helpful for traveling families. You only get a room with 2 twin beds if you book 3 bedrooms, as the 3rd bedroom is the one with the 2 twin beds. There is a sofa bed in the living room, but it is extremely uncomfortable (think springs in your back) and I do not recommend it.    In conclusion, I was very happy with this stay, and would come back again in the future. Based on the quality of the rooms, facilities, and the service, I feel that the Montage is among the best hotels in Hawaii. They really go above and beyond to anticipate your every need and the word ""no"" is not part of their vocabulary. The hotel is very family friendly and great for kids. If you're looking for some peace and quiet in Maui, this is an outstanding choice.",Apr 2017,April 2017,Traveled with family,"Get an ocean front room, it's worth it.",Los Angeles
473004489,50,"Awesome Service, Wonderful Place","Stayed at Montage in a 2BR with 2 young kids and two older parents. The Montage was the first of 3 hotels we stayed at in Hawaii (Westin Maui + Aulani in Oahu) and they spoiled us with (1) amazing service and (2) beautiful facilities. Montage was the perfect introduction to Hawaii, especially after a long flight. Check-in was great - they greeted us with leis and offered the kids stuffed animals and walked us to our room without having to go to a check-in counter. I'd definitely stay here again.    The room was clean and spacious and tastefully decorated with a large balcony for us to enjoy the awesome view of the pool and ocean. We ordered room service the first night and had dinner on the balcony with a perfect view of the sunset. Beds were comfy and the rollaway bed was already placed, and the fridge was stocked with water, so it felt like home right away.    Beyond the easy check-in process, I can remember lots of great service touch points. I won't list them all, but the bell service, valet service (equipped us with cold waters every time), housekeeping, pool/beach service, were all terrific. My son fell and had a minor cut at the pool, and they immediately comforted him and supplied band-aids. The grounds are lovely - so many beautiful flowers. Food was fine, but our favorite spot was Pineapple Grill across the way (Montage drove us over in a golf cart).    If I had to nit pick at anything, I'd say the pool is a little on the cold side and the beach is a bit far from the hotel room (as opposed to the Westin which is a short walk to the beach if you're staying in Beach Tower).

472811386,50,Impressive 5-Star Experience,"I had high expectations, and this place exceeded them. One thing to know is that it's not a large, sprawling resort like some of the other resorts in Hawaii. I would call it a ""boutique"" resort. Instead of 3 or 4 lobby shops, there is just one (plus another at the spa) with a small but good selection of items. Instead of 3 restaurants, there is just one main one (again, not counting the pool bar and poolside service), Cane and Canoe. But the size meant that the resort was manageable - it was never too far of a walk, and also the pool never felt too crowded and overrun.    Speaking of the restaurants, Cane and Canoe is excellent and has a great, varied menu, and the pool food is great as well. We ate at C&C every morning for an entire week and we never tired of the food - there is a good selection of standard hotel breakfast fare, as well as a few Hawaiian specialties - the Local Rice Bowl, a Loco Moco, Acai Bowl, etc.. The dinner is more high-end, but delicious as well. There is also a separate bar/lounge area with a more casual menu and a happy hour. And of course it's always nice to eat elsewhere occasionally, and Merrimans and Pineapple Grill are both in walking distance.    I was overall very impressed with the individualized attention that the staff gave me throughout the stay. They obviously go above and beyond to ensure that their guests are well taken-care of.    The rooms were the biggest/best I have seen in Hawaii - again, very impressive. I believe all of the rooms had ocean views and large lanais. One thing that I would say - the living room (which has a pull out couch) only has a very sheer curtain for the windows - obviously they know some families would use the couch to sleep, I am surprised they wouldn't provide darker shades for that room.    The resort is not overrun with kids but very kid-friendly, from the kids programming and cultural offerings in the mornings, to the pins that they give the kids for completing a ""task"". The pools didn't have things like slides or lazy rivers, but it was very fun to have lots of different areas to explore, and the main family pool had several areas that were shallow without exclusively being ""kiddie"" pools.

470993505,10,Spray Sunscreens: the New Second Hand Smoking,"During our stay at this ""luxury"" hotel I could not enjoy the pool or beach because the other hotel guests were constantly spraying toxic sunscreen, dousing everyone around them and creating a layer of chemicals on the surface of the pool and tragically these chemicals enter our precious Ocean. Most of the sunscreens being used were purchased at the Montage hotel gift shop and they are neither safe to breathe nor are they ocean safe.  In addition, I did not find the hotel to be health conscious at all as their restaurants had zero vegetarian, vegan, gluten free or organic options and only unhealthy beverage options. I asked the sommelier about any organic or biodynamic wines and was met with ignorance.  Overall, I am disappointed by and will not likely return as their presence on Maui is obviously ONLY for-profit and they are exploiting the land and encouraging tourists to trash the reef. I find it hypocritical that they try to embrace Hawaiian values!

469871187,50,Amazing!,"They truly provided 5 star service. Our check in was late as the room wasn't ready, we arrived around 2 and had to wait 2.5 hours, so we got to our room at 430, it through us for a bad loop as we had been up since 5am had a long flight then drive to the resort and didn't know they wouldn't let us check in early. It appears these higher luxury resorts really stick to their 4pm time and we'll have to remember that next time. They did accommodate us which was very nice and fixed the issue that night. They were very nice and pleasant throughout our stay, also very accommodating. Each and every person encountered was nice and helpful. The resort itself it beautiful the weather was amazing as well! The spa is gorgeous super overpriced but very beautiful and relaxing. I would definitely be back! We may stay in a different area of Maui next time even though this resort is literally the best in Maui, but if we may want to stay on wailea side and experience that.

Did not want to leave. We visited friends one afternoon who were staying down the street at the Ritz Carlton. Lovely property and staff, but so glad we decided to stay at the Montage instead. Busy hotel, busy pool, just not the same level of attention and service as the Montage. And the beach is a hike. Very rough water and wind in the Ritz location.

This place is so, so beautiful and quietly luxurious -- I have stayed in a lot of great rooms in a great hotels but this might have been my absolute favorite. We had a one bedroom residence and it was spacious, beautifully decorated, spotlessly clean, and just outstanding in every way. We did however have one significant service hiccup when the in-room wifi was not working. I called the front desk and was told that IT would come take a look, but that did not happen, and it was still not working the next morning. I called again and expressed that it was urgent that it be fixed as I had work to do, but three hours later, still nothing. At that point I called again, quite upset, and at that point things were fixed pretty quickly (it was such a simple fix - perhaps train the concierge desk to walk guests through basic troubleshooting steps?). But this was a serious lapse and just unacceptable at a property of this caliber. Once that was done we thoroughly enjoyed he rest of our visit - and I would absolutely return - but if you have an issue you cannot assume it will be handled efficiently.

Our room was even better than the pictures! Whenever we came back to the room it was clean and restocked.    The pools were incredible and the staff made sure we were comfortable, hydrated and fed. There seemed to be a pool around every corner.    While we were there we booked a complimentary session with Pacific Dream Photography. We had heard good things, but were still surprised by how amazing they were. Our photographer, Tiffany, knew exactly where to get the best shots and best light (even if it meant climbing slippery rocks). When we went through our photos with Jenna the next day it was harder to find what we didn't like, since they were all great. Thanks for making our favorite vacation last forever.

465768612,50,Incredible family vacation!,"A few weeks ago my family of 5 visited the Montage Kapalua Bay for 5 nights. It was a truly memorable vacation. The resort is incredibly beautiful and very well kept. The pool was on 3 different levels, all connected by various waterfalls, and the kids spent the whole week loving playing in it. The beach was very close, very clean, and had incredible snorkeling starting from about 10 feet from shore (you could swim with sea turtles!). The resort was in the middle of a fabulous nature walk that spanned about 3 miles along the ocean, which was lovely. The rooms were spacious and modern, and we had no problem with 2 adults and 3 kids being comfortable. Each room has its own button and exit on the elevators! Overall, the best feature was the staff. The concierge team is second to none. From helping us find the best place to watch the sunrise at 4am (jet lag) to finding dining, driving directions and which tour apps to download. The valet/bell team was special too, with tons of suggestions of their favorite local places to putting cold bottles of water in our car before our departure! Even the pool side staff was extremely friendly, and played volleyball with our kids! If you are considering going to Maui, spend the few extra $ and drive 20 min north of Ka'anapali (where most of the big standard resorts are) for something really special.

465596588,50,One of the best places we have ever visited,"The Montage at Kapalua Bay was a great experience from the moment we checked in until the time we checked out. These are luxury condos inside a 5 star resort environment. You receive individualized attention throughout your stay. This began with a warm welcome from the parking valet, the bellman, and the concierge. We received refreshing cold towels, as well as freshly sliced pineapple. After being escorted to our unit and given a brief introduction to the property, our luggage arrived, along with a chilled bottle of pineapple ""champagne"" which was poured for us. Great way to begin a vacation!    The unit itself was a one bedroom condo at around 1250 square feet. First class kitchen with sub-zero fridge and built in wine cooler. The master bath was great, as was the powder room. Beautiful living room and master bedroom, with a huge lanai that could have easily sat 10 people, even thought it was just two of us. Great view of the pool and the ocean. DirecTV and wifi were also provided.    The pool area was spectacular, with many different levels and areas you could choose to sit, including an adults only pool at the highest level. The pools were interconnected with waterfalls and stairways. Never a problem finding a place to sit no matter what time of day. Excellent drink and food service available starting. The only slight negative I would say is that there are day beds that are available at an additional charge, and these also each include two chairs near the day bed. These day beds and chairs occupied some prime locations, and I did not see anyone using them during the entire stay. A suggestion would be to at least ""unreserved"" the chairs near the day beds at some point in the day if they have not been rented out.    We only ate at the restaurant for breakfast. The service was great and the food was very good. Wonderful location overlooking the pool area and ocean. A nice way to start each day.    Concierges were available all the time, and a great help in planning dinners and excursions. They also helped us with an early check in and late check out which accommodated our flight schedules.

It had great reviews and we liked the idea of having a kitchen and a larger patio. We selected an ocean view room which was over $1000 a night. (And add in the $40 resort fee, parking charge and some hefty taxes). The first room we were escorted to was NOT an ocean view room and after some clunky interactions the manager moved us to a room two floors higher. The whole first experience did not feel welcoming or accommodating but almost like we were asking for something outlandish. The service around the resort is uneven, some places are great, particularly the bell staff (Rob, Chris, Justus) and some restaurant/bar servers (Taylor). The concierge staff is mediocre at best.

461475489,30,Beautiful resort with some tweaks it could be a lot better,"Once again I compare almost every five star property to The Resort at Pedregal in Cabo and this place lacks in multiple areas. For 1700 a night for a 2 bedroom residence you should expect a few perks and feel like a true 5 star property. The grounds were 5 star for sure, beautiful set of pools, great views and a nice trail around Kapalua.  Check in went smoothly, the staff was friendly at each encounter, however the rooms usually were not serviced until at least 3 despite us being out of the room most of the morning and day. The a/c was awful, it ran for 3 days straight and never made it below 72 and that was were the main thermostat was located the rooms were much hotter with tiny little vents barely blowing any air into the rooms. At 1700 a night I should be able to turn the unit into an icebox to comfortably sleep, not on top of the covers.  The dining lacks that of a 5 star resort. Average pool side dining and 1 real restaurant.  Pool service also is lacking and understaffed, having to hunt someone down to prepare your chairs is unacceptable and having to pay extra for cabanas..ridiculous..most days they were empty or maybe had one or two couples occupying them.  When you did encounter staff, they were very friendly and helpful. With this level of hotel I would suggest a personal concierge to help each set of guest and great them personally upon arrival.

I did not get the hotel feel but more a residence / condominium facility with some services. I would have liked to see more activities available on site and amenities. In comparison to other places we have been, there was not much to do besides golf and tennis which you even need to leave the property for. Additionally it is located in a very wet part of the island and therefore a lot of showers come through pool is nice.

Located directly oceanfront on the breathtaking and moderately developed Maui resort area of Kapalua Bay, this all condo resort/owned until property has an unbelievable main pool, beautiful grounds and plenty of outdoor spaces for social gatherings.    The ""room"" we had was enormous and elegantly decorated, with a spacious lanai and all of the necessities of home--everything from a dishwasher to a giant bathtub. Housekeeping service ensured we never washed a dish nor loaded or unloaded the dishwasher. They arranged cords neatly with ribbon. That's just the kind of attention to detail one wouldn't think was necessary until someone provides it.    Maui Grown coffee is provided in each condo and is delicious!    The benefits of Montage are evident--this is *truly* a full service property. No fighting for pool chairs, towel fees, wondering when someone might walk by or using a flag for attention. Everyone is appropriately attentive, taking the time to learn our names even on a short stay. We truly felt at home.    The property also offers in-residence dining, a full service restaurant, a well-equipped spa and fitness facility and multiple pools plus beach access. The food is fantastic and cocktails inventive--I enjoyed the Nanea everyday by the pool!    I was fully impressed by the deeply personal level of service, from the concierge pre-arrival to actual arrival, the valet and every other person on property, each of whom seemed genuinely invested in our having a wonderful stay.    A few small suggestions for improvement:  1). Offer basic kitchen staples via the concierge as an option prior to arrival. We stopped at the grocery store but still could have used olive oil, butter, and a few other things we wouldn't have thought to pick up and probably wouldn't need a whole lot of.  2). The exterior of some buildings shows some wear and tear--I imagine this is inevitable in an oceanfront location but was still surprised to see it.  3).

To keep it concise, I've broken it in to sections:  Room:  We stayed in 4606, which had DEAD ON views of the grounds, ocean and Lanai/Molokai in the distance. This was a 3-bedroom residence but had two of the bedrooms locked because we paid for a 1-bedroom. We couldn't really fairly call this a hotel room because it is truly a luxury apartment. Incredibly spacious, loved the full-kitchen and the massive Lanai with that amazing circular lounger. And the washer/dryer with detergent provided was a life-saver. Just absolute perfection.  Food/drink:  Cane and Canoe was delicious for breakfast and an absolutely beautiful, spacious setting. We got a bit unlucky with our server's forgetfulness the first two days (same person both days) but she was still very friendly and our third waitress was excellent. We enjoyed wonderful happy hour deals at the Montage Beach Club and our bartender there Lauri (may be misspelled) was incredibly friendly and helpful. The 1944 Mai Tai was very good and we had some incredible ahi tartar as well.  Service:  Every single staff member stopped to talk to us and offer assistance. The valet staff remembered us by name and went as far as driving us by golf cart to the spa montage (a short walk) because of rain. The staff really do go above and beyond and seem happy to do so. One young man at the pool area (Geri, I think), was talking with us about our desperate hope to see whales and even came back about an hour later to let us know about some ideas he had for spots to stop on our drive south for a chance of a sighting - and it worked! Our concierge, Jeramiah, was thoroughly helpful in providing tips for restaurants/activities and facilitated a smooth trip for us in every way he could.  Scenery:  The setting is absolute perfection. The location by Kapalua Bay is just breathtaking and the meticulously maintained grounds and gorgeous cascading lava rock pool only enhance the beauty of this place. The reason we chose the Montage was to get a bit more seclusion than some of the bustling resorts of Wailea or Kaanapali. And we were so glad we did. There were always people around, but it never felt crowded or too busy. Always a chair and even shade, if desired, in the area we wanted.  Cost:  We booked with a Virtuoso travel agent and the benefits were wonderful - room upgrade, upgraded welcome amenity and daily breakfast for two. This, in combination with a fourth night free promotion made our stay much more manageable considering we were on a budget. With this and the fact that you get a fully functioning apartment, I would say it is WELL worth what we paid.  In all, if you can afford it, there is no better option than the Montage.",Dec 2016,December 2016,Traveled as a couple,"Building 4 has direct views, room 4606 was incredible!",
447315542,10,Horrible Service,"We visited the hotel in hopes of having spa services and a relaxing lunch by the ocean. Neither happened.    We started at the Spa and requested a tour to see if my husband would feel comfortable with the spa and adjoining pool. When entering the reception area we were offered a tour and told to to take a seat in the lobby and someone would be right with us. That same employee then went into the adjoining gift shop and chit-chatted. After we sat for 45 minutes with no help, I made my way to the reception desk and the same employee (young Asian female) asked how our tour was. I then responded no one ever came to get us. She was embarrassed and then someone quickly came and got us for the tour.    Hoping to relax by the ocean and have a drink and lunch, we headed to the pool side caffe. Waited a long time for a server, then placed our order and waited over a half hour for drinks while our server exchanged personal stories with the next table. I got up and asked the bar tender, just steps from our table, if he had our drinks. He asked if the two drinks sitting in front of him were our ordered and I responded 'yes', his response was, ""I was wondering who they belonged to because they've been sitting here forever"". I expressed we were unhappy and a restaurant came to our table and apologized.    Next we headed to the front of the hotel. My husband had parked our car at the Spa parking lot so I sat on a bench to the left of of the front door and the Valet stand. As my husband pulled through the Valet circle, the Valet attendants tried to say Aloha to my husband. My husbands windows were rolled up and didn't hear the attendant, and I was out of view of the attendants. As my husband pulled through the round about to get me, the attendant very sarcastically said, ""Well Aloha to you too!"". As I stepped forward, and in view of the attendants, I said ""That is my husband and he's picking me up"". Knowing that they had been heard they could not have been more apologetic, and opening my door.

446722396,30,Good but not great,"this place apparently was a former time share and it feels that way. The grounds are very pretty, is peaceful and a quiet resort. The staff are great and very eager to please. the restaurant choices are limited and the food is average. The pools are very nice and no fights to get chairs or seated. not sure why they charge $400 for ""cabanas"" (that were all totally empty) that are neither private or very different from the regular chairs, short of some shade. The rooms are large but a bit dated in their look. my one beef was the $53 room service charge for 2 orders of $12 popcorn. after the $24 food order, was an 18% service charge, delivery charge and tip for a cool $53. if you want a very quiet, pretty place in maui this might be the place for you. if you want a beach right there, some life and more than one choice to eat, there might be better options. maybe the montage needs more time to bring it up to the level of their other properties.",Dec 2016,December 2016,Traveled with family,,nyc

Eli, Kyle and Brandon - and another man I didn't get his name but he works in the beach hut - took really great care of my family and were there for us at every moment. From setting up our chairs in the morning to giving us instructions on the equipment, giving sand toys to my kids and keeping an eye on safety.

We especially loved the deep lanai with the round wicker chair for two and the other abundant tables and chairs and the beautiful kitchen, which we made heavy use of. (The finishings could come out of a home style magazine.) The comfortable suite was really important for this trip because the weather poured (somewhat unseasonably) for most of the days, and it was really quite relaxing to hang out in the room and work out at the spa while the storm raged.    On the day that the rain finally let up and the sun came out, we snorkled in the Kapalua bay right of the resort, and that really is an amazing collection of fish (and sea turtles) to have right off of the hotel. It's also a public access beach, so everyone can enjoy it. There is a fair amount of coral too, which is what attracts the fish.

It was quiet, it was private, it was beautiful, the accommodations were absolutely top notch and amazing. They think of everything.  From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, we received the best treatment/service by every staff member. We felt like celebrities.  The setting here and the grounds are pristine and gorgeous. I just can't say enough about how awesome it is here!!!    Room service was terrific. We had breakfast multiple times out on our private lanai. They offer mimosas, delicious fruit, french toast, pancakes, you name it. We also ordered an amazing lunch one day (just felt like being lazy) and it was yummy too.  We ate dinner at Cane and Canoe one night and were pretty disappointed with the food (we didnt go back for dinner again because we didn't like it) but when we ate breakfast there several times it was absolutely delicious and to die for. The service there and setting were fabulous.    Our room and the view was absolutely gorgeous. Our housekeepers were phenomenal. I especially loved the fully stocked kitchen, the washer and dryer, and the giant soaking tub. We wanted for nothing. The coffee they offer in the room was so amazing we went to the store that sells it/makes it and ordered tons of it to be sent back home for ourselves and for gifts. (mauigrowncoffee.com)    The pools and beach here are to die for. The customer service is also amazing at the beach and pool. We enjoyed amazing snorkeling at the beach, amazing views, and delicious lunches and drinks by the pool.

Reviews have been superlative and each one is fully justified. Yes, it is pricey. Maybe more than pricey. It is worth every single cent. Even before we arrived, there were multiple emails welcoming us to the property, suggesting dining options and other activities. Upon arrival, we were greeted warmly by a host of staff members, provided with fresh orchid leis, and a seed necklace for the gentleman in our property. The front desk representative stayed with us for about 30 minutes while our 'residence' was being readied. Fresh pineapple chunks were offered and reminded us that we were in Hawaii.  We were walked to Building 4 where a two bedroom sumptuous suite awaited our arrival. The elevator is unique in that you punch in your room number (4402) and you arrive at the door of your residence.  We nearly gasped when the door opened and we entered an extraordinary space. From the beautiful wood floors to the super comfortable furnishings, to the top-of-the-line appliances and huge kitchen, to the spacious lanai, oversized bathrooms with soaking tubs, and on to the handy closets and really large bedrooms, everything was way beyond perfect. ( I've nearly exhausted my repertoire of superlatives.)  Everywhere there were thoughtful touches. The beautiful flowering orchid on the kitchen counter, lots of bottled water in the fridge, more kitchen utensils and appliances than I have in my own kitchen, three television sets...so much more.  We knew that the rooms would be refreshed twice a day. What a great idea. Staff members simply wanted to please the guests and did so without being obsequious. They were sincere at each encounter.  During our four day stay, we explored the many pools and hot tubs, ate at the Cane and Canoe restaurant, walked along the bluff overlooking the Pacific, took about a thousand photos (or so it seemed) and got to know various staff members. Several staff members represented the Montage with outstanding guest services. Be sure to meet Alison, Pool Supervisor, and Taylor whose assignment is the pool area. In valet service, Rob is a delight. Two very special people at the front desk are Jeramia and Whitney.  We've stayed in properties throughout the United States and Europe. Many of those hotels or resorts were superior. However, none could favorable compare to Montage. It stands alone. Awesome seems to imperfect a descriptor. How about 'awesomer?'  My congratulations to the management of Montage for making a glorious location extraordinary by filling it with the very best staff ever. We'll be back.  P.S. Though our children are adults, we stopped by the Paintbox which is devoted to little ones. What a place!

The staff were all incredibly friendly and helpful from the concierge, valet, pool attendants, room service, bartender down to the housekeepers sweeping the main lobby.

And everything was spotless. Most beautiful pools I've ever seen, never crowded or loud, amazing snorkeling in crystal clear water in a nearly private bay - brimming with sea turtles of all sizes and tropical fish. Complimentary Sunbum sunscreen at the pools too along with fun little snacks throughout the day. Warm and very friendly staff.

Tiffany met us at the Montage at our convenience one afternoon and walked us around the property chatting and snapping photos of the four of us and about 30 minutes later we were done. She was so professional and put all of us at ease immediately. I'm not a fan of having my picture taken and let me just say this was painless.

433328867,50,Montage with kids,"We just spent 6 nights at the Montage in Maui. My wife and I had a conference to attend at the nearby Westin, but we decided to stay here instead. I am not sure what kind of place my wife had reserved, but upon our arrival we were informed that we had been upgraded to a three bedroom apartment with premier ocean views. Our party consisted of my wife and I, our two kids, ages 8 and 6, and our au-pair, who would be in charge of the kids while we were at our conference. Our arrival was seamless, we were greeted with flower leis for the women and Kukui nut leis for the boys, a cool towel, a pineapple sampler, and a choice of either a really nice little stuffed animal (typical Hawaii fauna) or a book for the kids. In the meantime, our car was getting parked and luggage would be taken to our apartment. A cultural ambassador for the resort explained to us the opportunities the kids would have at their kids' area called ""The Playbox"", which has different activities every day. From there a resort person walked us to our residence in Building 1. We stayed at 1505, and, of note, the building has a semi-private elevator that opens to your apartment. Never during my stay did we have to share this elevator. 1505 is huge and elegantly decorated. The lanai is very large and looks out to amazing views of the bay. Our kids had a bed each and our au-pair had her own large room with a private bath with a very nice bathtub. We took the master, which opened to one section of the lanai and its incredible view. The grounds of the hotel are pristine and the pool complex is really pretty. When we go to Hawaii, we always buy the ""[Island] Revealed"" books, and the author of the Maui one says of this area, ""... where no dead leaf goes unpunished"", and it is true. As far as kids go, they don't have any slides or water play areas, but they did not mind this at all. Building 1 also has its own infinity pool with a food and drinks place, a fussball table and a jacuzzi area. We loved our apartment. The service was also great. The food we ordered for room service was always very good. The kids did one day of The Playbox activities and loved it. They did not go more because on the other days mom and dad forced to go with us and see the natural sites on the island and go on hikes and other ""awful"" things like that... just kidding, they complained, but once there they enjoyed themselves. Actually, on one of the other days, we took them to the Westin, where our conference was to swim in their pools (they had slides). Which actually gave us a chance to compare our experience in the common areas of both places. The Westin looked really crowded in comparison and somewhat gimmicky, with flamingoes and parrots in cages, stores and busy outdoor eateries. Montage was quiet, not crowded at all, and you almost felt like you had this amazing place all to yourself. We ate at the Cane and Canoe twice, once for breakfast and once for dinner. Very good, VERY good.  What else can I say? Oh, our building had a parking lot, so you just take the elevator down and you are there. The spaces are very narrow, which made it for a tricky parking job, but doable. And they equip your car with a sensor on arrival so you can get in and out of the gate without the hassle of putting your room card on a sensor or whatnot.  So, I must say, this resort is very expensive, but you will not find a lovelier place and a better stay anywhere else. The treatment of their guests is not only respectful, but kind. The grounds are amazing and its location can not be beat. Right in front of Kapalua Bay, which is gorgeous and where our kids were able to snorkel and see many kinds of fish and turtles (they have a kiosk at the entrance to the bay from the hotel that rents equipment - some people bring or buy their own if they are going to be doing this repeatedly as it is cheaper to do it this way).  We don't usually stay at places like this during our travels as we like to get out and experience the places we go to and not the hotel itself, but we make an exception every so often, especially when we do our yearly conference trip, and the Montage is truly amazing. Even though our days were mostly spent outside of the hotel, coming back to this beautiful place and waking up to amazing views of the bay and the island of Lanai in the distance was just worth every dime we spent. And, if you ask our kids, they absolutely loved it as well. They would rather have stayed at Aulani in Oahu again, but for us adults there is no comparison.

It is located on the breath-taking Kapalua coast, with 4 of the best beaches in the world (Napili, Kapalua, Oneola and Fleming) and majestic, rugged cliffs all within walking distance. It has a roughly 2 mile coastal hike trail that offers awesome and diverse views of Kapalua's best. The Montage sits right on Kapalua Bay and offers FREE beach umbrellas and loungers on our favorite and world-ranked beach, Kapalua Beach. This would cost you $200/day at Kaanapali Beach. Kapalua Bay has calm water, very suitable for children; a wide sand beach; very good snorkeling with abundance of tropical fish, eels and sea turtles; grass areas for a respite from the sand; and showers.    Enough on location. The hotel itself is magnificent and is more like a private resort than a hotel. The grounds and pools are beautiful. The rooms are 1-3 BR suites with full kitchen, full living room, dining area, washer/dryer, luxury bedrooms and bathrooms and unbelievable spacious lanais with comfortable patio furnishings and unrivaled views of the ocean, the neighboring islands of Lanai and Molokini and the sunset. Simply the best hotel room you'll ever stay in.    Breakfast at the open air Cane & Canoe restaurant was a highlight of each day, and the food and service from Erin was outstanding.    We were one of the first visitors at the Montage when it opened as a newly-acquired hotel, and we look forward to returning g every year. Our concierge, Ayami was very friendly and helpful in making reservations, and the guest reception manager, Justin, a fellow Texan, has become a friend!

428428074,40,Beautiful Quiet Retreat,"We stayed for 4 nights in early October, we wanted to try this montage property as we have been to the montage in DV a few times. This location did not dissapoint, I would have to venture to guess that they settled with a few things here and there after buying an existing location and putting the montage name on it. I believe all rooms are suites, ours well well equipped with everything you would need to cook every meal if you chose to. The main restaurant is cane and canoe, all meals we had at C&C were great, the service was very good also. This location is next to a very nice beach, the montage has chair service on the beach for paying guests. They also have a shuttle service all over kapulua. This location has lots of suite owners that live or stay on the property which created a little older crowd. I wouldn't hesitate to take our 3 Young kids to this location.

427410228,50,WOW!,"The Montage was the 3rd and final stop for my wife and I on our honeymoon. Having come from Koa Kea in Kauai and the Andaz in Wailea (which were both beautiful and outstanding) we didn't think it could really get any better. We were wrong.    We knew from the moment we pulled into the entrance driveway at the Montage that this place was ""next level."" The beauty of the property and the surrounding area is surreal.    We were greeted with cold towels to wash our hands and with fresh Maui pineapple slices. We were informed upon check-in that we had been upgraded to a premiere ocean view room (free of charge!) which was a wonderful surprise.    The hotel ""rooms"" aren't rooms at all, but instead spacious residences with every amenity you could ask for (washer/dryer/DVR/wine fridge/coffee maker, etc.). The view from our room was stunning, and our Lanai was so spacious it was a room in and of itself.    The pool is the most beautiful pool I've ever seen, with multiple levels that seemlessly flow into one another, with countless waterfalls and alcoves. The pool bar is great, bartenders Cody and Kiha were awesome and gave us great tips on things to do in Kapalua.    The beach at the resort is beautiful. It's not really a beach for surfing or boogie boarding, as there weren't really any waves. The coral starts just a few yards in, which makes it a fabulous spot for snorkeling. We saw turtles and too many exotic fish and other creatures to count. We also paddle boarded, which was a lot of fun (the guys who work at the beach club were super friendly and helpful).    We ate at Cane & Canoe several times during our stay. The food was delicious. I actually preferred their breakfasts over dinners.    Obviously, this hotel isn't cheap, but if you can afford it then GO, as it was an amazing experience all around.

One night my wife and I stayed in the suite for dinner; three ladies came in to perform the turn down service. The dining room is very nice and the staff are very friendly. We also went to dinner at Merriman's. i like the food better at the Montage. We had the breakfast package. The options were varied and very good. Also plentiful. There are multiple levels the the pool. The upper level is for adults only and no iphone. We were given towels and a glass of ice water as soon as we entered the pool area. I cannot say enough about the quality and service at the Montage.

The condo was very nicely decorated and furnished. We can't speak to the quality of the hotel rooms, but we would reserve this room again. The layout of the property, especially the pools is excellent. The adjacent Kapalua Bay beach rates up there with the beach at Mauna Kea, and surpasses it for snorkeling. The reef is in above average condition, with lots of fish and more turtles than I have seen in one location in a long time. If you are a strong swimmer there is a lot of territory you can cover outside the bay. In the area a several other excellent sites the the Cats from Lahaina & Kaanapali come up to snorkel on.The beach staff were friendly and efficient. Service throughout the Hotel is very good to excellent. The food could be better especially at dinner, but breakfast and the food at the pool were good. Cocktails at the pool bar were excellent, but at the dinning room bar was below average. Fortunately there is Merriman's just a short walk from the Hotel that can't be missed.

421300757,30,Don't be fooled by the Montage brand,"They don't make a big deal about it, but this hotel was not built nor developed by the Montage people. The hotel is a repackaging of a timeshare/fractional development associated with the Ritz Carlton Kapalua. We were expecting an experience a hotel similar in quality to their Laguna and Beverly Hills properties, which are outstanding. The suite was dark and average and the hotel felt dead. We bracketed this stay with stops at two Four Seasons, both of which felt very well occupied. Two specific issues. The fold-out couch in the living was cheap and unusable and my daughter came home with multiple bites. Also, the beach concession is not managed by the hotel and service is a bit off. Twice we had threadbare towels and the guys working the beach spent half the afternoon playing. Not something you would ever find at Four Seasons.

414369362,30,Good.. But not the level you would expect from The Montage,"We have just left the Montage Kapalua Bay after staying for our honeymoon and felt the need to write a review to express our somewhat disappointed feelings.    We are a regular face at The Montage Laguna Beach which we cannot rate highly enough, so not knowing too much about Maui we figured with the Montage name and the gorgeous location, we couldn't go wrong.    Certainly, there have been many plus points to our stay and the island of Maui hasn't disappointed but the key feeling of the Montage throughout this last week has been...average.    First of all, the rooms (residences) are fantastic for their size, facilities, lanai and general specification so cannot fault the Montage with this aspect and the setting they have chosen is absolutely stunning. We spent many an evening, sitting on the Lanai taking in the surroundings in addition to snorkelling in the crystal clear Kapalua Bay. We went for an upgraded Ocean view and were very happy with the position of our room. Another plus point is the Spa Montage, which had great facilities (although the ladies steam room broken for the whole week) and there is complimentary use of these facilities for all guests.    This is sadly, where we have to mention the not so great points:    Atmosphere - there is none. For the $40 resort fee (which I have to question what it includes as you have to pay extra for everything else on top) you expect there to be a 'resort' feel to the hotel, which there isn't. Sure, there were some families using the pools albeit completely ignoring the parts that were meant for adults only (the staff ignored this too) but I would hazard a guess that almost all of these families own timeshare apartments and aren't actually 'hotel guests'. Because of the fact that a large proportion of the Montage is made up by the timeshare apartments, it means there are very few guests and also very few 'resort' facilities.    Our room was located in building 3, meaning we had to walk past the Cane & Canoe and hotel bar to leave everyday and apart from the occasional lonesome figure in the corner of the bar (which was rarely open) or one/two tables of families in Cane & Canoe, it all seemed eerily quiet. Putting this down to off-peak season, we then wondered up to the Ritz-Carlton to view as a comparison...something we which we later wished we hadn't! It was buzzing with activity (although not too busy), lots of little shops, numerous restaurants etc and walking distance to the general store which is exactly what we had hoped from the Montage.    I then have to mention the staff - everyone we came across was pleasant however seemed very 'expectant' in wanting something in return every time you speak/interact with them - in particular the valet parking attendants with whom we were less than happy with. We had hired a Mustang for our time in Maui as a bit of fun however on more than one occasion after arriving back at the hotel and leaving the vehicle with the attendants, we spotted them revving and racing the car out to park it (they obviously thought we couldn't see them). As it is a hire car we let this slide at the time, however would most certainly have not been so discerning had it been our own vehicle they were revving around! You do not expect this from any parking attendant, let alone a Montage parking attendant. In addition, their turn down service is extremely unpredictable, one day we had turn down at 6pm during dinner and another at 8:30pm? Some consistency would be good here! The housekeeping staff also mistakenly took away one of our robes during a clean up and failed to replace it for the entirety of our stay.    Overall, our stay was good and we have loved our honeymoon, however we feel Montage Kapalua Bay has a long way to go if it wants to keep up its standards in line with its sister properties or indeed the other big players (Ritz-Carlton, Four Seasons, St.Regis). For almost $1000 a night and the overpriced restaurants/facilities, we would expect our experience to be nothing short of fantastic, to come away with just a good feeling is not what we had expected from The Montage.    Needless to say but with a heavy heart, next time we visit this beautiful island we will not be staying with The Montage.",Sep 2016,September 2016,Traveled as a couple,,Shrewsbury

413328333,20,Does not live up to the Montage brand....,"So many things to discuss so little time....    First, this is the priciest place to stay in Maui. With that said, you naturally come in with many expectations. This property is not a hotel by any means.    We paid for an ocean view and were given a partial ocean view after checkin. While they did change the room after we called a few of my belongings were left in the old room and were never found again. Some other concerns: limited service throughout the property. Poolside service was terrible, nobody to take orders and only 1 person to get everyone set up in a popular time of day. No steam room available throughout my 5 night stay and was continuously told that someone was coming to fix it the next day. Mediocre spa and again no attendants. Another incident I won't forget: I am well familiar that Montage always gives its guests complimentary logo hats. After passing by the valet on my way to the spa I realized I forgot my hat and upon asking for one I was instead given a frown from the attendant, followed by ""I already gave your family 2 hats"". REALLY?!? I just paid well over $1k/night and your don't want to give me a 25 cent hat? After seeing my frazzled face he handed me one. I told him thats ok don't worry about it and he continued by saying we are only supposed to give these out after checkout....    The only nice this about this Montage is the room size. I can go on about little things like lack of room amenities to larger things like lack of restaurants and staff.    If you are looking to stay at a hotel I highly recommend the Four Seasons Wailea; we were lucky enough to stay there right after the Montage Kapalua and cannot compare! At the Four seasons you are welcomed with an ""aloha"" every time any employee sees you. Anytime you need ANYTHING they are truly at your service. I even had a headache at one point late in the evening and after telling my room service waitress Amanda, she without hesitation went out at midnight to the drug store to get me meds (and never charged me for the run)! They have a musician nightly in their bar and complimentary programs for the kids. Fantastic breakfast buffet with awesome chefs ready to make you whatever you wish for! They provide you with almost everything you need for a baby including diapers, wipes, monitors etc., and other things Montage did not offer. Even Montage Laguna Beach offers better service at a fraction of the price. I guess we were comparing this property to that one the whole time. I even spoke to a front desk manager about my concerns and while she did say she would relay the concerns the only thing she offered me was a tiny deduction off my daily stay.

413160543,50,exceeded expectations,"when i booked this hotel, we booked a 2 bedroom condo for myself, husband and 2 kids (9 and 13). however, i didn't realize that it is a resort and run like a hotel, not like a condominium complex. the hotel concierge emailed me prior to arrival with questions about our preferences and any arrangements we wanted to make in advance. they also sent directions the night before. we were met with a lei greeting, juice and pineapple and walked to our unit. we arrived to a warm welcome with a painted poster in the unit for the kids. the unit was huge! we were on the 6th floor, so the view was incredible, and we had a huge outdoor patio to see it. the bedrooms were large, although they both had kings beds, which was my only complaint. if this is a family resort, then one of the bedrooms should have 2 beds for kids. my son ended up sleeping on a pullout sofa in the living room, and they did offer a cot as well. since the unit was so big, it didn't really matter. the bathrooms were also huge with lovely amenities. the kitchen was modern and clean and the washer/dryer was a gift for us, to leave with clean clothes! we purchased food at a local market and made dinner 2 of the nights, and a few lunches too. it was a nice option for everyone to take a rest from going out every night.  we ate breakfast daily in the cane and canoe restaurant, with delicious, made to order food and they were very accommodating with requests. poolside food/drink service was also delicious and efficient. the service is amazing, and they always know your name! one server asked our name because there was another family with a similar name and she didn't want to insult us and call us the wrong one. then, she apologized for asking, which i told her was unnecessary.  the pools are great, interesting with waterfalls, hot tubs, serenity pools, etc. the beach was small, and nice, but not great waves for boogie boarding. better more for snorkling.  the spa is incredible! we had an outdoor massage in a hut that was amazing! while you were covered and there was a ceiling fan, you could listen to the waves of the ocean and the sounds all around you. highly recommend! as for the activities, you are part of the kapalua village so you can use the tennis center and golf courses. the tennis clinics were a great workout with knowledgable staff. we played family golf, after 230p, the kids are free with a paying adult, and free rental clubs.  i will say, the one downside to staying in kapalua is the weather. they have their own little eco system and if it is raining there, it probably isnt 5 minutes away. it is the rainier area of the island, but for us, it didnt really affect us. there were some passing showers, but never a washout day. as long as you know what to expect, it isnt bad. it is also near to lahaina for shops and restaurants.  regardless, this resort was a pleasant surprise and exceeded my expectations and we would definitely return.",Aug 2016,August 2016,Traveled with family,high floor for best view,"White Plains, New York, United States"
412769830,50,They Get It All Right...,"We capped off our week long Hawaiian vacation by spending two nights at this beautiful resort in northern Lahaina on Maui. Next time we will stay longer. The location is about an hour drive from the airport (OGG). Upon arrival, we were greeted at the valet and escorted to the concierge. The Koi pond-surrounded walkway to the resort's main lobby gives you a first glimpse of the paradise that opens up before you. The concierge warmly welcomed us with leis before escorting us to our unit. Spacious is an understatement - we booked a premiere ocean-view suite - the unit was enormous. It was absolute luxury. The view from the living area and master bedroom was breathtaking. Had we not already made dinner reservations, we would have had a hard time finding a reason to leave the suite. Dinner at the resort's Cane and Canoe restaurant was superb. It was delightful to be surrounded by couples and families all enjoying their time together in this elegant and peaceful setting.  The appeal of staying in a resort like this one is the ability to just relax. Although there are plenty of activities for families, lounging by the pool was exactly the right activity for us. The ""serenity"" pool is for adults, and although you can hear youngsters splashing off in the distance, serenity is achievable - especially with an adult beverage (which are available after 11:00 a.m.). The coastal trail to the north of the resort takes you past beautiful rocky coastlines and idyllic stretches of white sand beaches. Just to the south of the resort is a beach that provides ample opportunities for aquatic adventures - snorkeling, paddle-boarding, etc.  Staying here does not come cheap. It is a luxury resort with a corresponding price tag - our massages at the Montage Spa came close to $800, dinner for two - $200. That said, it was worth every penny.

There was also a full size comfortable pull-out bed in the living room. Our stay was nothing short of magical. Yes it is expensive - more so than getting 2 rooms or renting a VRBO unit. But it was a 20th anniversary / high school graduation / 18th & 16th birthday celebration. We wanted somewhere special and we got it! The hotel is intimate, gorgeous and unique.    Our room was on the first floor and we had a huge lanai with lots of great seating. From there we were a few doors down from the restaurant and the lobby, and yards from the amazing pools! Words cannot do justice to the beauty of the resort and the surrounding area. We also loved the warm and laid-back vibe of the resort. They have a sensible policy for holding pool chairs but we never needed to do that. While they do have some covered loungers you can pay to reserve there was plenty of amazing seating that was free. Like the resort itself the pool felt fun and energetic but never crowded! We have a pool at home so generally when we go on a beach vacation we like to be at the beach. But our whole family loved this pool and spent hours there too! It was fun without being over-the-top!    Like the resort, the restaurants are expensive. It is an island resort. However not only was the food great but the portions were huge! We generally just brought back everyone's leftovers and had them for the lunch the next day!    The Beach at the hotel was about a 5 minute walk for us since our room was closer to the pool / restaurant area. The snorkeling was amazing. We saw turtles and an amazing eel. As others have noted, Kapalua Beach Crew provides towels, chairs and umbrellas to Montage guests for free. They also have boogie boards, snorkeling equipment and stand-up paddle boards for rent. Don't do it! They are outrageously expensive. Snorkeling equipment can be had at Snorkel Bob way cheaper - you can walk there from the resort. And the Valets have a little area filled with boogie boards and SUP equipment that people donate. You just borrow and then return it!    Kapalua Beach is great for snorkeling and for small children but that's a trade off for not having any waves to boogie board. If you start out along the coastal trail walk you will come to Oneloa beach. The walk is only about 5 minutes and it's breathtaking! The beach is blissfully uncrowded and remote feeling. We went 3 times and felt the waves and undertow were definitely manageable for our kids. Having said that there is no lifeguard and conditions are always changeable. The next beach over is DT Fleming and I believe they have a lifeguard and a small restaurant. We meant to check it out but never did. In addition, unlike Kapalua beach there is no helpful crew to provide you with chairs and more importantly umbrellas. So we would generally head to Oneloa for about an hour and then gratefully make our way to the Montage pool!    We had told the Montage it was a celebration for our family and sure enough we received champagne on arrival (for our anniversary), 2 chocolate mousse cakes and cupcakes for the birthdays / graduation! We all agreed that we have never stayed in a lovelier place and probably never will! Ed the singing attendant gave a great Ukulele lesson. Taylor was a bar tender extroidinaire! We kept our activities to a minimum while we were there and just enjoyed being in such a unique hotel. If I had to point out any drawbacks it would be not having a boogie boarding beach where you can sit under an umbrella. Also the concierges are all great but I do think they push certain outside operators. For example, they offered to arrange a free photo shoot for us. I appreciated the suggestion because it never occurred to me. We don't usually do posed pictures but it is such an incredible setting. However I asked to get an idea of the photographer's pricing and it was expensive! So I did a little research on trip advisor and found someone who includes all of the pictures for one price. Similarly we were trying to arrange a sunset sail and the one they kept suggesting offered very little discount for kids and all the food / drinks were a la carte. It would have cost our family several hundred dollars more than the one I found on TA. Overall however I cannot recommend the Montage high enough!",Aug 2016,August 2016,Traveled with family,We stayed in the 3000 building on the first floor and being near the pool / restaurant were...,"Chicago, Illinois"

As good as it gets. Pools brilliant, beach right next to hotel and great gardens.    The only buts I have are:  1) this is the wettest past of the island. Probably a blessing as it can be really hot so at least you get an odd shower or cloud to give some respite. You can always drive 5mins down the road and it's a whole new climate if you not happy.  2) we had issues with our rooms hot water and aircon. Credit where credit is due - the manager put her money where her mouth was and did give a credit for the ongoing problems. Had she not this review would have been a 4 star but she delivered and should be rewarded.    Other than that the rooms are incredible - enormous and brilliantly finished. The staff and especially the pool staff should get a special mention - they were excellent.    The food at the pool could have been of slightly higher quality but I am probably being overly fussy as it wasn't bad.    I will one day be back in Maui and think i would probably stay here again.

403821177,50,Great team that goes the extra mile!,"We recently returned from Maui and staying with friends at Montage at Kapalua Bay Resort. The Resort is spectacular. The resort grounds, rooms and service were all 5 Star. Cane and Canoe restaurant is amazing.    But the stars of the show were the Montage Beach Crew. Rarely are you surprised at resorts of this level but this is exactly what happened at the beach at Montage. The Beach Crew really is a special group. While on the beach the service we received was top notch. Montage offers complementary chair and umbrella service with added bonuses like frozen pops, cold towels and bottled water service. But what really caught our attention and showed our family true selfless customer service was the Beach Crew’s handling of a potentially deadly situation regarding beach goers that were not even staying at Montage and were set up on the far end of the beach away from Montage. Two swimmers were caught in a rip current and were being taken out of the bay. The Beach Crew guys noticed the couple was in trouble and without hesitation grabbed two boards and went out into very rough water to retrieve a man and his wife. Without their very quick thinking and amazing ability on the water this could have turned out extremely different. The Beach Crew brought the couple back to the safety of the beach riding on the SUP boards. Their expertise on the water was stunning. The couple was very lucky these guys were around and I have no doubt the couple owes their lives to the Beach Crew. Thanks for the wonderful service and thank you Montage for putting this great group together.",Aug 2016,May 2016,Traveled as a couple,,

My parents, both siblings and their families, three cousins and their families, and aunt and uncle all stayed at this amazing resort and we have no other words to describe it other than amazing. The rooms were spotless each day and I was so happy to see that they picked up everything for us. The guest services were fantastic and if we ever had an issue it was fixed immediately. The pool was perfect for both kids and adults, which was nice when it got hot. The beach was also so clean and beautiful. I never once saw a piece of trash on the ground, and it wasn't ever too crowded for us. We were there for 10 days and a lot of those days were spent outside of the resort, but we never had any troubles leaving or entering the resort. And, of course, nobody wanted to leave.

382550232,50,"Wow, Just Wow!","Montage Kapalua as well as Maui far surpassed our expectations. I am a huge fan of the Caribbean, Turks and Caicos (3 hour flight for us) in particular. I can say that the flight from New Jersey to Maui (about 13 hrs with layovers etc) was well worth it, we will go back. From the moment we landed in Maui (via Honolulu) we were stunned by the sheer beauty of it. Every time we turned a corner there was another magnificent view. Montage Kapalua is absolutely wonderful. The facilities were gorgeous and spotless. The fitness center has plenty of equipment (including a stepmill) and was probably the best I have ever had the pleasure of using in a hotel. The staff at Kapalua were wonderful. Jason and Chris by the pool were always giving us water and brought towels as soon as they saw us, calling us by our names. The parking at Kapalua is valet. While I did not love that (I felt badly asking them for the car for a 15 minute trip to the store) they were wonderful about it. They would actually run and get it for us, never making us feel like we were bothering them. The room itself was lovely with a huge lanai with great furniture. We stayed in room 4302 and I have to say the view was spectacular. My husband and son played Plantation golf course. They said it was hard but great.

382047091,30,"Based on previous reviews had much higher expectations and was disappointed, particularly considering Montage brand","The Montage is pricey, however I'd read some stunning reviews both on TripAdvisor as well as on FlyerTalk so I felt it was worth the premium. However, ultimately we were disappointed by the service and numerous mistakes by the hotel during our stay.    When we booked, we paid extra to get an ocean view room, and based on what folks said online, it seemed like you actually got an ocean view room (a lot of Hawaiian hotels say they're ocean view, but it's only if you crane your neck from your lanai). In addition, we booked through iPrefer, which said we'd get an upgrade if available.    When we arrived, we were told we'd been upgraded to the top floor in our building ""in the best of your category"". However when we got to our room, we realised we were both physically furthest away from the beach, and only halfway up the building. The view was mostly of pools and palm trees, and the ocean was not visible from within the room.    I get that hotels have different categories of rooms, and the Montage had a ""premier"" ocean view category, but I found two things particularly frustrating - one, I felt the ocean view category was misrepresented by the hotel, but worse, was the treatment from the staff - both being told incorrectly we were on the ""top floor"", and then being made to wait 2 hours before we got an answer whether a room with a view was available.    Then throughout the stay the staff continued to insist they were checking to see if we could get moved later, which never happened. I would've much preferred a transparent explanation of the room and our upgrade possibilities. (we also made it clear we'd pay to get a decent view)    So not a great start to our trip, but there was a lot of good, and not so great aspects of staying at the Montage.    The good:    The hotel itself is spectacular. The landscaping is amazing, and the pools are sublime. Our kids loved swimming every day. Sunset in the pool was incredible.    The music in the evening was great. Very pleasant sitting on the lanai and listening to it.    The hotel provides plenty of bottled water. If you're buying groceries, don't bother buying water. In fact, the hotel was great at providing water at all times - at the pool, the restaurant, and in the room.    The check in procedure was pretty great. Pull up in the car, have someone meet you and take you immediately to your room. All our bags and groceries were taken care of - awesome.    The kitchen setup is excellent.    The fish feeding in the mornings is a lot of fun. Both my boys looked forward to it each morning.    The hotel gives out badges to kids for activities earned. My older son loved this, and it got him much more interested in doing activities. He still talks about going back to the hotel with the badges.    There are some great kids activities near the pool - giant size connect 4, and cornhole.    Some great staff experiences - specifically with the valet.    The bad:    Inconsistent pool service. Sometimes snacks and kids' drinks would be available and offered to us, but often times nobody around and nothing offered. Sometimes we'd get approached very quickly, and then other times not at all. We'd see abandoned chairs left uncleared for an entire day. People smoked by the pool and staff turned a blind eye to them.    For a recently updated hotel the room had a lot of issues. Our DVD player did not work. Maintenance randomly showed up while we were eating dinner to fix a lamp which housekeeping had reported broken.    Inconsistent service at the bar. We had some amazing cocktails, and some pretty terrible ones. One evening we showed up at the bar at 5:15pm, and got guilt tripped by the staff member there when we ordered (""but I was just about to leave, there's nobody else here"")    The breakfast is crazily slow and the wait staff were weirdly rude. e.g. we'd be sitting for 10-15 minutes and they'd just arrive at our table and say ""yes?"" with their pad out. Breakfast took at least an hour each day - I'd recommend not getting it included.    Fitness center hours are just bizarre. Daylight only - 6am-7pm. No ability to use your evenings to catch up on exercise.    Housekeeping replaced one of our mouthwashes with one that was already open. Some days they'd replace our 4 towels with 2 or 3.",Jun 2016,April 2016,Traveled with family,"If you want an actual ocean view, book a premier ocean view","Palo Alto, California"

They don't have rooms but ""residences"" that is 1-3 bedroom suites with a full kitchen, living room, and we had a large lanai (balcony) with an ocean view (highly recommended.) The service was superb. Everyone on the staff tries to learn your name and is extreme friendly. It was like ""Cheers"": everybody knew your name. The rooms were furnished in the contemporary style, it had two large screen televisions, and it was immaculate. Service staff came in twice a day (the latter time as a turn-down service.) Although we had no kids with us it would be perfect for a family. Not only can you get residences with separate bedrooms for the kids, there are activities for kids from 5-17. There are two pools, a beach close by, and an area for snorkeling. There is a nice paved path along the shore that runs about 1.75 miles partly through a bird sanctuary. Concierge service is great and our concierge arranged dinner reservations, excursions, and even found ice for my twisted ankle. The restaurant in the hotel has great food but is very (and I mean very) expensive. Luckily there are some restaurants nearby and a shuttle between them and several neighboring resorts.

379406089,50,KAPALUA AND THE MONTAGE SAYS IT ALL!,"First let me start with Kapalua Bay is our all time favorite spot on Maui, we have been visiting this area since 1985 and is still one of the most beautiful places on earth!  We used to stay at the Kapalua Bay Hotel,however it closed down and we had hoped it would reopen with new owners. to our sadness the tore down the hotel and built multi million dollar what appeared to be condos. We were devistated! So that moved us to the Westin Villas and now own 3. Getting back to Kapalua. 2 years ago we received an announcement that The Montage was offering their Villas and we thought, heck we can do this and it is on the grounds we love so much. Bookings were made, we were treated on the call with 10** Glove Service. Upon check in, you would have thought that we were Royalty, they greeted us by Name, all accomodations were already taken care of and we sat for a few moments with our hostess going over the resort and to expect quick, prompt service 24 hours a day. The lobby is STUNNING! By the time we were finished with our meet and greet we were led to our Villa, our bags were there 2 minutes later, litterally! Entering the Villa our jaws dropped, the LUXURY of the Villa,~ Understated Luxury, amaziing views of the ocean, from SubZero Refridge, Wolf Range/Oven Wine Cellar, Granite Counters, to the Marble Baths. We had a 3 bedroom Villa, the patio had to have been 60 feet long by 25 feet deep. Table with chairs, Lounge Chairs, Day Bed and PLENTY of extra room, could have held 60 people! Sumptous for sure! No pomp and circumstance, just the opposite, you knew you were someplace special.  The POOLS, Adult overlooks the pools below, to the ocean across the resort. Attendants were at your beck and call, actually they must have been mind readers, just about when you wanted something, they were right there. To the waters replenished, to the afternoon treats, one day it was just a few nibbles on fronzen grapes! Down to the next pool Adult and Kids, long windy swimming pool and tiered down to the next level. Under the bridge they have a pummeling waterfall you can sit under and get your own free massage, to the area where you lay down in your own setting and the water rises out of multi holes, bubbling away lightly at your body, and at first you think, well this cannot do much, and after a bit, you realize this is pure luxury and one of the best non human hand massage your body desires. I was so relaxed, it was amazing! Then down to the kids pool where there are 2 levels, one for tiny tots to the next step down where kids can play in shallow waters and just have fun! Dinner at their restaurant was fabulous, service was great. We were sad to leave, however we were joining our Godchildren and their mom at the Westin Villas for a week and knew we would have a great time with them. We did of course, and decided we would go back to The Montage for the last few days of our vacation. WE were expecting the same level of service, and not surprised when it was delivered. The Montage for sure is a place to stay. We hope you enjoy it as much as we did.",Jun 2016,October 2015,Traveled with family,Upper Ocean View or Ocean Front are Stunning!,"San Diego, California"
378979116,50,A Truly Magical Place,"My family of five stayed at The Montage for eight nights the end of May to celebrate our 25th anniversary. Let me begin by saying I received an email several weeks before our trip from our personal concierge offering to help us schedule activities and reservations before we arrived. She was extremely helpful! We rented a three bedroom oceanfront grand residence and have never stayed in a more beautiful place. Let me begin with the accommodations: the 3 bedrooms were large and well appointed with spacious bathrooms as well. The beds were comfortable and closets roomy. The living space included a gourmet kitchen, a living and dining room , office space with desk and pull out sofa and a large laundry room with its own entrance from the outside. That was very nice if we came in sandy or wet. Huge windows and sliding glass doors allowed for ocean views from wherever you were. But our favorite part was the lanai overlooking gorgeous oceanfront views. It was furnished with comfortable wicker sofas and coffee table, a large dining table and 6 chairs, a built in grill area and 2 chaise loungers which were in front of the master bedroom. Access to the lanai came from the dining room, living room or master bedroom. The Montage furnished many things other places did not: laundry detergent and dryer sheets, dishwasher detergent and dish detergent, gourmet coffee and salt/pepper. Our refrigerator had cold bottle water, chocolate covered strawberries and champagne in it when we arrived! And to top it off, we had cleaning service with turn down twice daily. Now the resort: The Montage staff and employees, from the cleaning crew to the concierge, were absolutely outstanding!! Everyone was so friendly and concerned with making sure we were taken care of. Pool and food servers greeted us by name and always had a welcoming smile. At the pool, someone greeted us daily, covered our lounge chairs with towel covers, provided towels for us and brought us cold water. The additional food and beverage service at both pools was outstanding. We ate breakfast in our residence but ate lunch daily at one of the bar areas. The food was delicious with a wide variety of fresh seasonal choices. When we were deciding where to stay in Maui, we wanted adequate beach area to enjoy. The Montage has a sandy beach located on a small bay which we thoroughly enjoyed. Chairs, umbrellas, towels and towel covers were again set up and provided for us. We were able to rent snorkeling gear, paddle boards or kayaks on the beach, also. I will say that at times the beach was a little crowded, but they were always able to accommodate us. We also scheduled a snorkeling trip to other areas of the island, but the fish and sea turtles we saw in this bay were outstanding! A couple of other things: because of how beautiful our lanai was, and also because of having a little jet lag , my family decided to eat in our residence a couple of nights. We were able to order in room dining that was set up for us on the lanai. The food was not just dropped off, but the table was set and readied for us to eat. When we were finished they came back and cleared off everything. We also had the option of ordering food ready to be cooked if we so desired. The view from our lanai beat any view from a restaurant! There also additional resort activities that we did not use that were available, some more geared to younger children. We did walk the coastal trail that started at the resort and led over to a rock formation called Dragon's teeth. It was a gorgeous seaside walk! . My husband went to the spa for a massage to ease his back after the long flight. He was very pleased, although he thought it was quite expensive. We both used the workout area which we thought was very adequate for what we needed. The spa also offers a wide variety of classes. We have three older teenagers/young adults who were just as pleased with The Montage as their two older parents. We very much enjoyed the peace and serenity this resort has to offer. We were very sad about leaving and cannot wait to return!",Jun 2016,May 2016,Traveled with family,,"Bristol, Tennessee"
378367765,50,Impeccable service in a dream location,"1. Service is so good it's jaw-dropping. Staff never says ""no"" no matter what you ask for. Want towels and water when you get your car? How about returning from a hike or snorkel with wet towels? ""We'll take those for you.""    Kids were feeding birds at pool. I'm sure this is not welcomed given likelihood that it increases birds gathering and begging (and going to bathroom). Staff didn't say a word.    Within 1 minute of showing up at pool, a staff member will appear and say ""let me put a chair cover and towel down for you"". They even do this for kids when adult isn't around (we have teenagers).    When I had to wait 12 seconds for my car (not kidding), the staff apologized to me for the wait. I looked at him and said ""you're kidding right?""    2. Rooms are condos. We had one bedroom. It was 1200 sq feet. Huge bedroom and master bath. Better kitchen than I've ever had in my home. Every kitchen gadget you'd need to live there. Free ground Hawaiian coffee every day. Washer and dryer with detergent.    Two clean up times, one in morning, one in evening. You can even select times.    Our lanai was at lease 400 sq feet.    3. Property has great pool laid out with ""river-like"" passages and areas to hide and have alone time. There's an adult only infinity pool but we were all happy in main pool. A public beach is 2 min walk away. Great snorkeling!! We saw everything. Hotel provides free umbrellas and beach chairs. It is a bit rocky though.    An 8-min walk away is another public beach at Napili Kai Resort. All sand. Great waves for kids to play in. Must bring all your own stuff.    We found a deal on Costco that included air, hotel, and car. Otherwise it is extremely expensive.    Would we come back? Hell, we wanted to move in at this resort.",May 2016,May 2016,Traveled with family,,"San Francisco, California"
377461020,50,Simply the best!,"Heaven on earth at the Montage. My husband and I had a perfect 10th anniversary/babymoon. Some of the highlights:  -The grounds are magnificent. Really, really pretty and well-manicured. The views were amazing, especially from our porch.  -The room was so spacious and well-appointed. We enjoyed the porch, the living room, the kitchen, the washer and dryer, and the huge bathtub. The housekeeping staff made sure the room was always spotless, and they regularly brought us bottled water. Also, the room includes everything you may need (such as dish tabs and laundry detergent.)  -The staff members we encountered were so friendly, personable, and helpful. Folks remembered our names, what we were celebrating, and just generally made our trip so nice. Some high-end resort staff are snooty, but we didn't find that here.  -Hanging out by the pools was lovely. We enjoyed the chill vibe of the spa pool and the great seats at the main pool.  -The location is great for exploring the Kapalua Coastal Trail and its beaches, and also nearby Napili Beach. Definitely check them out.  -We did a session with Pacific Dreams Photography, and it exceeded our expectations. We bought a bunch of the photos and can't wait to order our prints. Highly recommend taking advantage of their complimentary shoot.    We are now at a luxury hotel on the Big Island, and I already am missing the Montage so much and hope to return. Overall, it was our best vacation ever.    While the Montage is superior in nearly every way, there are only two things I'd suggest to make it even better: 1) The pools are refreshing (a bit cold). I think they may be being cooled? I might raise the temp a couple of degrees. 2) The sign-in at the fitness center/spa seemed a bit tedious for Montage guests.

Staff was always there to lend a hand, whether it was planning a local excursion or finding the perfect beach or pool chair.    Cane and Canoe restaurant beat out the infamous Merriman's, by a long shot in my opinion.    The boys down at Kapalua Bay knew how to get you in the water and were sure to point out what to look for when snorkeling.    The entire property had plenty of staff to go around.    Kiha, Nic, Chris, and Cody, you guys rocked it! There were many more staff members that went out of their way, but the 44's did their job a bit too well, sorry!    Aloha!

After bringing our bags and popping a cold bottle of chamoagne, the bellman walked through all the room functions and made sure we had everything we needed. The view was amazing...we instantly relaxed.    We took advantage of the entire property, using all the pools and especially enjoyed late night and early morning swims with no one else around. We spent time at the beach club pool, Lori is a great bartender and gave terrific advice for things to do on Maui. Pool service was also great - food was delicious. The spa service was incredible and we loved smoothies and coffee there each day. We did the couples massage which should not be missed. We also took advantage of the snorkling in fantastic Kapalua Bay, and the complimentary photo shoot.    Highly recommend you splurge here, you will not regret it!",May 2016,May 2016,,,Sacramento

Room was very nice. 1 bedroom ocean view in building 3. very convenient building as its close to the lobby and adult pool.staff is awesome. food at cane and canoe was great for breakfast as well as dinner. everything is impeccible.    EXCEPT for one annoyance. And this is why i give 4 stars instead of 5. Many hotels do this, i cant stand it.. stop doing this. when you make the bed, hotels do not use a fitted sheet. so they try to cover the whole mattress with one sheet. but that is not enough. so they don't actually cover the foot edge of the mattress with the bottom sheet, and then try to hide it but tucking in the duvet cover at the bottom.    i you are 6'2 like me when I get into bed, my feet hang off the bottom, and with no sheet covering the mattress they rub directly against the mattress or mattress pad. this is extremely irritating.    however after calling down to the front desk someone came up and fixed it within 10 minutes. after that it was done properly each day.",May 2016,May 2016,,,United States

371676753,10,Beware booking this hotel: Dishonest regarding charges made and failure to refund monies,"A booking was made at this hotel through Hotels.com by someone else and the full cost was charged on my card. Hotels.com confirmed that they can only refund monies if the hotel in question approves the refund.  I spoke to the hotel accounts department (Lori) who confirmed over the phone that a charge of one night ($990) was taken and she provided me with a reference number. I then spoke to Hotels.com who informed me that she had denied the refund.  When I contacted her again she denied telling me the information over the phone in the initial phone conversation. She told me she had never said that and denied giving me the payment reference (which is clearly not true as I have the reference number.)  As a result Hotels.com are unable to refund the charges taken on my card which amount to $6,800. I am therefore out of pocket by almost $6,000.  Previously I was overcharged by the Four Seasons Hotel in Wailea and the staff there were so helpful and refunded me straight away.  It certainly begs the question why this hotel is refusing to authorise a refund by Hotels.com, despite the charge for cancellation and no show is one night.",May 2016,September 2015,Traveled with family,,"Sydney, Australia"
371584778,50,"A relaxing stay in a ""residence"" hotel","We spent a very relaxing 7 nights at Montage Kapalua Bay in Jan/Feb. We have been to the Hawaiian Islands over 75 times and have seen and done it all before. We were looking for something different, wanted peace and quiet and to just relax by the pool . The weather was excellent! We very much enjoyed our stay at Montage Kapalua Bay.    This is the location of the original Kapalua Bay Hotel. Montage took over the Ritz Carlton Residences (timeshare condos), added a restaurant, Cane & Canoe, and built the pool complex to turn it into a ""hotel."" We received an invitation and went for cocktails and appetizers to tour the units that are for sale which are in the best locations and not part of the hotel.    We booked a 1 bedroom Premier Ocean Residence thru iPrefer choosing the Montage Memories Package which included valet parking and $60 breakfast credit daily. The concierge contacted us before arrival to set up dinner reservations, activities and inquire about our arrival time. When we pulled up in front of the hotel the bellman was expecting us, greeted us by name, and we were ushered just inside of the hotel to see the beautiful view and met with fruit, juice and cold towels. We were then taken directly to our suite #3503. No stopping at the front desk to ""check in."" We were given a 3 bedroom 3 1/2 bath unit with 1 bedroom/bath being locked off. The view was nice, but honestly I was expecting to be much closer to the ocean and to be able to see sunset booking the ""Premier"" Ocean category. We decided not to say anything about the view as the extra space seemed to be a fair trade off. We called our son who is a student at UH Manoa in Honolulu and he flew in to join us for 2 nights.    Our kitchen was upscale and had everything you could ever need. We stayed in and cooked a rack of lamb dinner one night...a first in 32 years on vacation! We ate out on the balcony with live Hawaiian music down below on the lawn. The beds were very comfortable and the sheets high quality. Bathrooms large and well equipped. The rest of the furniture was condo like and nothing special. We had stopped on our way in to buy laundry soap but it wasn't needed as the washer and dryer came with soap and dryer sheets.    Service at the pool was excellent no matter where we chose to sit each day and we spent every day at the pool. Staff called you by name, remembered your drink preferences and were very professional. It was perhaps the best poolside service we have received in Hawaii in years....a step above Four Seasons! Given the time of year there we only a few children so it was perfect. No problem getting lounges as the resort was pretty empty. We inquired about holiday times and were told that you need to arrive early if you want a space as there are many families then. Lunch at the pool was good altho a little more variety and some Ahi Sashimi on the menu would be a plus. One negative would be the trash and old cups under the cabana on the mountain side of the large lower pool. These were never occupied during our week long stay and was never cleaned up throughout our stay. It was very noticeable when swimming.    Breakfast in Cane & Canoe was nice. Good selection and friendly, professional servers. We ordered room service breakfast one morning which was also good quality. We had asked the gentleman who brought us to our room on ""check in"" if room service breakfast was included in our package and he replied that ""he believed it was."" When it showed up on our bill at check out we inquired and were told sorry, room service is NOT included. They said they would correct the gentleman so he would not make this mistake again.    We visited their bar twice for cocktails and bar food for dinner. Food and drinks were good. This is a small dark space with a pool table in the back. No real view. Service was not as good here compared to the rest of the property...what we would call ""Hawaiian Time."" The bartenders were talking to returning owners as well as locals. Normally we would visit the bar for an after dinner cocktail every night, but it closes early. This is a ""residence"", and there is nothing after 9/9:30pm.    Concierge was great with excellent follow up communication. They booked Merriman's and Sansei Sushi before arrival. They were also able to secure same day second reservations for us at both these restaurants at our specified time. We highly recommend both restaurants! No need to drive or taxi to Sansei Sushi, ABC Store or anyplace else in the Kapalua Resort. The Valet will call a resort shuttle that will pick you up and return you at no charge. Excellent, knowledgeable, friendly driver.    Overall we really enjoyed the tranquility of this resort and it exceeded our expectations for a ""residence"" resort. As ""young"" retirees who travel extensively, we will definitely return to this property again during non holiday times. Maybe even spend a month or two here to enjoy Hawaiian life.

370964022,50,Luxury and Privacy,"The Montage exceeded our expectations on all levels. We came for golf at Kapalua thus why we picked this northern Maui destination. If you're looking for peace & quiet, incredible golf and great food (couples retreat VS family/children), then you're in the right place.    LOCATION: It's a bit far north from the happening Lahaina or family friendly Waialea resorts, you'll get peace and quiet here. It's definitely it's own little community though, think the country club of Maui. The waters are crystal clear blue up here, and the cove just off the hotel is perfect for sea turtle snorkel or amateur cliff jumping. We would take walks along the volcanic rocks and run along the paved beach walking route in the early mornings. Loads of great restaurants, mostly $$$-$$$$ dining but you get what you pay for.    DINING: Walking distance to great restaurants like Merriman's, a quick taxi/drive to Sansei as well as delicious and elegant onsite meals at Cane&Canoe. I wasn't disappointed once. Definitely rent a car to drive down into Lahaina to experience Miso Phat Sushi & the famous macadamia nut pancakes @ Gazebo. The Montage has a covered parking garage with elevators directly to your room for easy access.    STAFF: Helpful, efficient, timely, friendly and on point. They were invisible when I wanted them to be and there when we needed them. Excellent service.    SPA: Incredible. I'm a spa junkie and the Montage did not disappoint. You can get a great massage anywhere, but unique treatments and amenities speak to me. Book a couples in the private hut, have them open all the doors and have a true outdoor, tropical experience- trust me.

368864666,30,Great Hotel Except for the Front Desk,"The Good: The Montage is a beautiful hotel with big rooms. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The lanai is big and has wonderful furniture. The beach near the hotel is average but was not too crowded. The valet and the house keeping staff were excellent and helpful.    The bad: The pool often had leaves in it. The pool towels were old and used. The pool furniture could also be updated. The workout room was only open in the evening until 7PM so workouts after dinner were out of the question. The resort fees are not cheap. We were told valet parking was free, but that was after the $40 a day resort fee and a $30 a day parking fee. The internet was very slow, especially considering the $40 resort fee. I used my cellular provider as it was faster than the hotel internet.    The Ugly: We had a huge problem with the front desk clerks, especially the ones that worked the evening shift. We had reserved and were charged for an Ocean View Room, but it was a stretch that we had anything more than a garden view room. We were on the second floor (even though the evening hotel staff insisted it was on the third floor), and it was difficult to see over the palm trees. Upon check-in we felt we were given a garden view room, but the evening clerk insisted it was an ocean view room. She told us she would try to relocate us and get back with us by no later than the next day. We never heard anything from the front desk and when we went back on the third day was told the hotel was full and we could not be moved. She seemed somewhat annoyed with us and told us we were on the third floor (but there was no first floor, so we were on the second floor) and we could see the ocean under the palm trees. Checkout was at 11AM and we received a letter under the door for late checkout to contact the desk. When I contacted the desk, we were told that was impossible since other guests were assigned to our room the same day that we were leaving and they would be arriving at 8AM, even thought check-in was not until 4pm. ""It would be helpful if you could vacate the room as soon as possible in the morning"". The hotel staff at the desk did not make me feel welcome at all and made the difference between me rating this hotel as five stars and three stars and never wishing to stay there again. In all honesty, I spent the previous four nights at the Four Seasons Lanai before my five nights at the Montage Maui. Both hotels are beautiful, but the difference between the desk staff at the two properties is the difference between night and day.

(So do the amenities.) Looking for a place to dine? Ask anybody there and they will give you the best options. Making the trip to the crater? We were offered a blanket which was a life-saver! Beds are extremely comfortable. I'm a dentist and a good mattress is a must-have. Our room was so quiet, I never heard another person unless on the patio. There is no comparison to the grounds and pools. We explored the entire island, but on days we wanted to stay close, Kapalua beach was the perfect spot to catch some rays and snorkel. We saw several turtles here. There was one minor incident where housekeeping threw away a crumpled paper bag that looked like trash. I had small trinkets in it that I had purchased in Hana. When checking out, we made the concierge aware of this. A couple months after we arrived home, the trinkets that had been thrown away accidentally arrived at my doorstep. They took the time to locate the remote store along the Road to Hana and get the same items! Talk about integrity! Not once did I feel like they thought I was fibbing.

366887057,50,Amazing second time here - can't wait for our third visit!,"We love the Montage! It's such a beautiful resort, the service is amazing, the setting is breathtaking - it's an all around luxury resort.    We spent four nights at the Four Seasons in Wailea and four nights at the Montage in Kapalua. A few comments on the Montage:    * Gorgeous, spacious rooms with a full kitchen, washer/dryer and huge lanais. They are apartment/condo style - definitely a high point for us. We had plenty of space!    * The Paintbox kids club is wonderful. Cherie and the staff there are all fantastic. One comment is that the Four Seasons has a complimentary club and was just as good. Perhaps the Montage should think about a complimentary club to attract more of the Four Seasons guests who choose the Four Seasons for the complimentary club.    * The grounds are beautiful and the hotel's gardeners take amazing care of the plants and foliage.    * We had breakfast at the hotel each morning. Service and food were both very good.    * Kiha, our bartender turned friend, was great. He went out of his way to make sure we had a fantastic time while at the Montage. He is an artist and drew beautiful tattoos on our 6yo daughter's hand/arm which she loved. He also went out of his way to show our 6yo where the geckos lay their eggs and educated her on the local reptiles. One evening we mentioned to Kiha that the concierge wasn't able to get us a reservation at the nearby Merriman's restaurant as it was fully booked and Kiha texted a few friends and got us in at 7pm. He was always super friendly, went out of his way to help us and very knowledgeable about Maui.    * Pools are fantastic and the pool staff was very service-oriented and always pleasant. Not hard to get a chair each morning.    * The young lady in the gift shop with the big smile was always so helpful. Her smile brightened my day whenever we went in.    * Arrival amenity for our 6yo was fantastic. She loves her new dolphin stuffed animal.    * Super easy arrival and check-in.    * Valet and bellman service was always professional and timely.    * There is a charge if you want to check out late. It'd be nice if we could have gotten a complimentary late checkout but we understand it can't be done when guests are checking in same-day. We had a 10pm flight home and chose to spend our last day by the pool. We took full advantage of the showers/changing facility and were happy we made the decision to stay pool-side on the last day.    * Definitely go snorkeling at their beach and bring/buy your own snorkeling equipment if you plan to snorkel more than once per trip. Every time we snorkeled we saw sea turtles. Amazing experience.    We loved it and will be back!    Sue, Pat, Ella  Boston, MA",Apr 2016,April 2016,Traveled with family,,"Marshfield, Massachusetts"

362940322,30,This isn't a kiddie park,"The hotel has a children's pool yet allow children in the Montage Beach Club pool. There is a sign with rules that blocks the view of patrons sitting on lounges and yet virtually no one follows the rules when it comes to the behavior of parents of small children. Yesterday there were so many enormous floatation devices in the pool that adult patrons could not even go in to cool off. This is a very serene setting that has become dominated by children on floating swans and chickens playing Marco Polo at the top of their lungs. Montage obviously encourages this since they've now added a ping pong table and foosball game to the adult bar area. So anyone lounging between the pool and the game area can barely relax with the overwhelming noise. For the amount of money spent by adults to enjoy this hotel amenity, there should be much more consideration.",Apr 2016,April 2016,Traveled with family,,"Lahaina, Hawaii"
362488366,50,Phenomenal Resort Experience !,"This was my first stay at the Montage Kapalua Bay. We arrived late at night and were greeted by the staff who were prompt, helpful and very friendly making us feel at home after a long day of travel. Our suite was absolutely beautiful with an unbelievable view of the resort, Kapalua Bay, Molokai, Lanai, the whales and of course, breath-taking sunsets! The spa services/staff and facility were fantastic. I was always amazed how efficient the house cleaning staff were. We would go for a walk along the coast line every morning and by the time we got back the suite had been serviced. There are a variety of pools around the resort all of which are beautiful and well maintained. The staff were efficient and friendly. Kiha was exceptional. He was very friendly and always remembered my name and made me feel welcomed. It was also clear that he cared about the resort and the Kapalua Bay area ! As fate would have it, his Aunt Silla also works at the resort as the cultural liaison. She makes you feel like family and knows an incredible amount about Hawaiian culture and history in general, as well as the Kapalua Bay area. Overall the whole experience at the Montage was fantastic and filled with memories that will last a lifetime!",Apr 2016,March 2016,Traveled as a couple,,"Omaha, Nebraska"
361880390,50,Memories are Made at Montage,"We arrived at the Montage in mid-afternoon and were warmly greeted by the bellmen who assured that we need not carry anything and all would be brought to our room. As we walked down the entrance to the hotel, we caught our breath at the beautiful view that lay ahead overlooking the tranquility pool which cascaded down to other pools and then to a magnificent greener than green lawn. All of that somewhat prepared you for the sweeping ocean view that lay beyond that. Good thing we were handed welcome drinks by the manager as that helped wake us from the mesmerizing view.    Perfectly situated on the coastline, the Montage is a series of buildings with luxury suites/condos curving around this fantastic precipice. Our suite was recently refreshed, very comfortable, spacious and had a generous lanai with plenty of lounge ability! While we reserved a 2 bedroom/2 bath, we were actually placed in a 3 bedroom/3.5 bath with one of the bed/bath combos being locked. Both of our bedrooms had ocean views and ensuite baths - perfect accommodations for families. Additionally, a full kitchen stocked with utensils, pots, dishes etc. and high end applianced (Wolf/SubZero) was there for our use if we desired (the only thing we desired was to make coffee - heck - this was vacation!).    The resort has a large spa/fitness facility. While the fitness center is available for guest use and it is well appointed, classes are an additional fee. My husband had a massage but was underwhelmed given the price.    The service and staff were terrific - always welcoming, helpful and gracious.    A couple of notes:  Very family oriented - especially at Spring Break - lots of young children, group gatherings and nannies make for a competitive lounge chair exercise and a noisy poolside. There is a small pool located at the Beach Cafe which would be ideal for families with teens or couples, however, the Kids Club also uses it at what seems like the most inopportune times - this would be an easy fix if the the Kids Club was not permitted to use that pool.    Should we return to Kapalua Bay, we will certainly stay at this lovely retreat.",Apr 2016,April 2016,Traveled with family,,"New York City, New York"

It's quite impressive!!    The grounds are gorgeous!! Maui has become quite busy and you will NOT get that crowded feeling at the Montage. It's really one of only a few resorts on Maui that is not crowded. Plenty of pool chairs for everyone (which is greatly appreciated as seeing people get up early to save chairs at other resorts is just silly)!! Also, love the fun snacks they pass out poolside!! Nice touch Montage!! Beach is great for snorkeling and swimming!! Very safe beach for kids!!    The rooms are very nice, plenty of space for families!!    Oh and don't forget to check out the spa & gym!! AMAZING!! They also have a delicious juice bar located at the spa.

360998932,50,Outstanding and Memorable Property: Wave to the Whales !!,"We loved our recent stay at the Montage Kapalua Bay. The property itself is gorgeous, with lovely, lush floral landscaping, plush green lawns and spectacular ocean vistas. During our stay in March, we were amazed to see whales swimming offshore from the hotel grounds and from our balcony. Even with our late evening arrival, we were warmly greeted with leis, refreshing pineapple and bottled water (we declined champagne). We stayed in a two-bedroom suite, which was spacious, well-maintained and tastefully decorated in cream and neutral tones. Each bedroom had a king bed (extremely comfortable mattress), a large, marble, en suite bathroom, with a separate toilet, spacious shower, soak tub and double sinks; there was a half bath off the suite's entrance hall. The granite-countered kitchen was spotless, with sparkling appliances. The ""key"" was the washer and dryer (detergent provided), because we were in-and-out of our bathing suits and exercise clothing the entire week. Both of our teens spent significant down time reading and napping on the spacious and substantial lanai, with its beautiful ocean and sunset view. On the whole, we were extremely pleased with the entire staff, who are friendly, courteous and eager to assist. We were delighted, for example, that housekeeping left our leis in heart shapes and neatly tied our numerous power cords with bright purple ribbons daily. Pool, bell and valet staff remembered our names during our stay, and the food poolside was excellent; we recommend the fish tacos. Our rental car was always ready promptly upon request. The fitness center is spotless, with excellent cardio equipment, and the locker rooms were luxurious and stocked with all of the necessities, including deodorant, razors, hairbrushes. The beach crew is excellent and hardworking (Brandon gets a shout out"") -- our daughter loved her stand-up paddle board lesson, and we took a private kayaking excursion with Kyle, who was a knowledgeable and friendly guide. The concierges were all excellent; many thanks to Jeramia and Janet for their time, personal attention and spot-on recommendations. Montage managers David and Brandt are excellent and extremely responsive as well. Some minor caveats: the WiFi poolside was finicky, though fine inside. Since since our stay was during peak-occupancy Easter week, competition for lounge chairs and umbrellas by the pool was fierce (advice: get out there before 10 AM to secure a spot; pool attendants will ""hold"" the chairs for two hours only; and the lower pool -- where families with younger children and babies congregated -- was fully occupied earliest). The beach is beautiful, but small, particularly at high tide. However, there is wonderful sea life, including turtles, in the waters off the beach, so be sure to rent or bring snorkeling equipment. Bottom line: particularly if you're from the U.S. East Coast or another distant location, and wondering whether the long flight and a stay at Montage Kapalua Bay are ""worth"" the jet lag (not a bad adjustment, by the way) and expense, the answer is a hearty ""absolutely."" It's an unforgettable experience. Mahalo!!!",Apr 2016,March 2016,Traveled with family,,"New York City, New York"

If you want the best customer service bar none-this is it. If you want all of the amenities at a luxury resort, but with a small hotel feel, this. is. IT! From the views to the considerations on the menu and staff, we were not disappointed. I went to the spa and fitness center almost daily-loved the classes and the spa treatments. Our three daughters fell in love too-with the paddle boarding on the ocean to the swimming through the waterfalls at the pool and to paintbox-their kids club- our kids were always welcomed and they even asked for more days at kids club! Lastly, I loved that this resort stays true to its surroundings and is respectful to its Hawaiian culture which also made this not just another hotel-but a full experience. Such a pleasure.

The setting, service and amenities are second to none. I will give you an example of the excellent service and detail provided by the Montage staff. I stayed at the Montage in May of 2015 and was no able to book for my most recent trip to Maui March 2016 and instead booked the Ritz-Carlton (check my review) I drove the short distance from the RC to the Montage for dinner one evening and pulled up to valet parking. Keep in mind that in 2015 I had a silver sedan as a rental and this time I had a red SUV. As I got out of the car I asked 2 of the valets if they remembered me and my girlfriend and they said ""yes, you are from the Phoenix area and then told me my name!"" This is 10 months and several thousands of guests later!!! Are you kidding me?    If you want the absolute best service by the best people in the industry.

357749745,50,Luxury resort in a tropical setting,"I spent the entire day relaxing at the Montage. I started at the Spa at the Montage. After a brief tour of the facilities I settled in for a few hours of relaxation by the pool and spas. The grounds are beautifully landscaped with lush tropical plants along with ginger and hibiscus flowers. I enjoyed the entire mountain to the sea, or Mauka to Makai spa journey. Starting with the infinity pool with gorgeous views towards the ocean, on to the bamboo rain forest shower, eucalyptus steam room, cedar sauna, and waterfall hot tub. I ended my spa experience with a cup of the the refreshing Mamaki tea that is served throughout the spa. It is a Hawaiian wellness tea made from a local growing shrub, and used for healing practices and healthy antioxidants. It tastes great too. Day passes to the spa are only $55, and are good from 7am-7pm. Plenty of time to unwind.    After feeling refreshed I headed in to the ladies locker area to get ready for dinner. Everything you need is provided for you here. No need to pack your blow dryer, curling iron, hair spray, shower products, razors, slippers, or even hair brushes. Which makes getting ready to enjoy your evening a breeze. I was able to jump in on a wonderful tour of the grounds and accommodations. The rooms have multiple bedroom options with full kitchens, the units are bright and spacious, and perfect for honeymooners or big traveling families alike. The pools are surrounded by lovely ocean views with bars, lounging areas, grassy nooks, and family friendly activities throughout. They have a lovely day rental facility called Cliff House that sits right on the edge of the lava rock point. You can't picture a more beautiful place to spend the afternoon or evening. A kids club called Paintbox is available to keep the little ones busy, and the teens can enjoy activities such as stand up paddle board lessons in lovely Kapalua Bay.    Dinner at Cane & Canoe was amazing! We were even greeted by Executive Chef Viviano, and we enjoyed a delicious meal that nicely incorporated the exotic flavors of the islands. I indulged with the Akala cocktail made with elderflower and grapefruit, and really enjoyed the mellow fruitiness of it. We had a big group for dinner, so we were able to order many of the items on the menu, and sneak bites off each others. Here are a few of my favorites: the Crispy Suckling Pig is so extremely moist on the inside and crispy and sweet on the outside, the Goat Cheese Tempura with lilikoi and fresh greens is amazingly flavorful and light, the Lobster Mac & Cheese was hearty and a great comfort food with a gourmet twist, and the Filet Mignon with the twice baked potatoes and Maui onions is not to be missed. Dessert here at Cane & Canoe is a must! The highlights for me were: the Vanilla Panna Cotta & Lilikoi Gelee with scrumptious basil pearls...its a little bit of heaven in every bite, and the Kaffir Lime Creme Brulee with fresh berries is just perfect. Live music plays nightly in the restaurant, and 25% off for kama'aina on Monday and Thursday.    To sum it all up from the moment I walked in the door I was treated with aloha, always made to feel like the enjoyment of my stay was top priority, and reminded that kama'aina are very much welcome here at the Montage. I can see why they are one of only two hotels on Maui to recieve a 5 star rating from Forbes Travel Guide. I highly recommend that you call and book your stay today!

There are giant tvs in each room with Direct tv sattelite dvrs so you didn't have to miss a show, which was great for the kids. We cooked dinner in our room several times and the kitchen was perfect for that. There are all the pots, pans and utensils necessary, plus there is a viking grill for fish and meats. Also all the appliances in the kitchen are top of the line. The pool bars made outstanding cocktails and the food was delicious (we ate there for lunch several times). The beach was a little small, however the water was great for snorkeling, we saw 5 sea turtles while snorkeling 10 yards from the beach. Also the guys that work down on the beach were great, fast at setting up chairs and umbrellas. The view from the room was amazing, every morning we would spot whales while having breakfast. The staff at the Montage was great, the maids came twice a day, once in the morning to clean and once in the evening to spot clean and do turn down service.

The staff is stellar from check-in to breakfast, poolside, cleaning, room service and more. The view is breathtaking! We spotted several whales and absolutely loved the walk from the hotel to the beach just north of the property. It's a bird sanctuary and makes for an easy hike (running shoes recommended). It's absolutely worth your time to do this walk even if you're not a nature lover. The vistas are so amazing! The room service at Montage was the best we've ever had - and we chuckled at the fact that it was one of our best meals over 10 days in Kaui and Maui. The chef is clearly inspired (excellent lamb, tempura battered goat cheese, lobster Mac and cheese, Swordfish, Mahi). Breakfast is delicious (albeit expensive). The pool is lovely with different levels of depth which is perfect for all ages. Towels are abundant. Quiet area and kid zone at the pool. The beach on the property is lovely (caution with the rocks if you're body surfing which applies everywhere really). Merriman Restaurant is next door, good food, make a reservation. The valet is among the best - and they even bring up your groceries and put them away. The location of Montage is beautiful for views -- but note that the weather is unique. It's quite windy and misty, with cloud cover... And yet only 20 minutes south, the skies are completely blue with no rain. Each day for 5 days, we headed to other beaches for guaranteed sun. As we returned to Montage, the light mist started up. When we asked locals, they said it's like a magic weather divide nearing Napili. I would stay here for sure but be prepared to travel for full on sunshine.

There was an adults only pool which was nice but they are all connected so you can still hear screaming kids. I think that is a given no matter where you go. But everything we had was top notch.

Mother Nature and her magnificent ocean in Kapalua Bay were large and in charge, to say the least. My husband and I were heading out to snorkel in the beautiful bay, as we have enjoyed annually for over 10 years...thinking ourselves fit and accomplished swimmers, we found ourselves being subtly swept too far from shore. Turns out a kind young man paddled up to us on an SUP to inform us of a rip current, and suggesting we head  in another direction to get out of rip current. (had no idea at that time who this person was) So, we began to swim in that suggested  direction. Both my husband and myself kicked and swam just as strongly as we could, but to no avail. We were going nowhere. Finally, we realized we were in trouble. I was getting pretty nervous, survival-mode beginning to kick in. My husband, Steve, waved at the SUP guy who immediately once again paddled toward us to help. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, a second guy on an SUP board was there to rescue me. These two guys had us climb ON their SUP boards and they, so strongly, paddled both of us safely to shore. I was never so glad to feel sand beneath my feet!  Turns out, these two HEROS, Kyle and Eli, are the Kapalua Bay Beach Crew team.  We have read reviews and replies by the Montage Manager, David Hoffman. So, Mr. Hoffman, we want you to know that not only are your Beach Crew team taking good care of your guests, they went so above and beyond their duties to save OUR lives today. Words just can not express our sincere and heartfelt thanks. These two young gentlemen were calm, reassuring, strong, and humble as they offered their help in saving our day and our lives. Without them, our holiday could have turned in to a most different outcome. We are warm and safe in our condo tonight thanks to Kyle and Eli's care and concern.

352920829,30,Montage Kapalua Bay,"Having stayed at the Montage Deer Valley we thought we would try Montage in Maui. Montage Hotels aspire to compete with the Four Seasons and Ritz although they are still a young company with only 5 hotels. They charge similar rates.    The resort is situated nicely with some white water ocean views however the architecture lacks sensitivity and detail. Rather bland and from a distance you might mistake it for an office complex. It has a small beach next to the resort but this is public, busy and many locals use it.    The rooms are well sized spacious and comfortable but like the building design are plain. You feel the interior designers were given a 4 star brief, no wow factor or individual touches or real theme.    The service is ok, the staff polite and friendly but not sharp which is what you deserve and should expect for these prices.They are mostly new to the business it would appear.    In fairness the food was very nice.    We had several things not working in the room all of which should be regularly checked and clearly were not.

351381602,40,A little Disappointing,"Nice hotel but enough disappointments to give it a 3/4 rating. My main issue with this property is the pool. There really is no desirable area that's geared for adults (ie gorgeous view, quiet, umbrella) except the bar area at the top which we found to be quite unappealing. If we were lucky enough to stumble upon a spot where we could read and enjoy the pool then there was no ocean view; alternatively if you sat at the bottom where there's a full ocean view, then you are sitting at the little kids' pool with lots of noise and running around (and seriously, where are their parents?). I don't want to sound like a grump but sometimes you just want to relax and take in the amazing scenery without having to sit on your balcony to find it. We were thrilled when on day 2 we discovered what we thought was a small adult infinity pool with dead on ocean views but soon discovered it was for the residence club (as well as hotel guests) so while it's picture perfect and serene early morning, by noon it is swarming with nannies and babies and lots of crying. Another negative is the beach is very small and public and as much as the nice hotel staff set up chairs, it really wasn't a great beach unless you like sitting on top of people... but we did have lots of fun paddle boarding. Our room was amazing - like a condo with two bedrooms and full modern kitchen - but how odd to be on the ground floor with a giant patio but have no window coverings in the living room so at night people can see right in. The restaurant tried really hard to please but other than breakfast we had better dinners off site. Lastly the gym was amazing and gets an A. We heard the property was originally built as condos for the Ritz and it looks like it - just a big giant set of concrete buildings.

Our room had a well appointed master bedroom, full kitchen, living room and a huge balcony (I'm guessing 600 sq ft.) I believe every room has a view of the ocean. The staff is highly attentive and warm from the moment you arrive to the moment they close the door to your car on the way out.  The pools, spa and beach compete for your favorite spot in the resort. The spa is top notch with plenty of great work out space, state of the art spin cycles, and gym equipment, and plenty of massage area for both indoor and outdoor massage sessions.  The spa also has a sauna and eucalyptus room paired with a cold shower if that is your thing. My wife raved about the two massage therapists she used, while I enjoyed both exercise classes.  The beach sits in a protected cove that is open to the public, but was uncrowded during our stay. You can rent snorkel gear, glass bottomed kayaks and other gear to enjoy the underwater sites.

Children are not welcome at several of them but there are pools that welcome children.    The views of the Pacific are outstanding. There is also a nice beach in a cove. Activities available are snorkeling, surfboarding and paddle boarding with equipment available for guests right at the beach.

346004707,20,Beautiful resort in fantastic location but too many errors/accidents for the price + be careful eating at the pool,"To be fair, I want to compliment excellent helpful concierges/front desk staff and well trained, always polite valets. The resort is in a beautiful location: you are facing two other islands and the views are breathtaking. The free shuttle service makes it convenient to go to neighborhood restaurants.    I however can't give more than two stars taking into consideration the amount the spent for our 12 nights vacation and the service we received.    To begin with, you should be aware there is zero activities offered at the resort for those with kids who are under 5. There is no playroom or playground within a close distance either. The resort gets completely quiet dark and empty by 9 pm. If you are looking for a feeling of isolation- it's great, but wasn't fun for us. There is no healthy options on the kids menu. No fish. No beef. No chicken breast. No pasta. Only: fried nuggets hamburgers FROZEN mac cheese and hot dogs.    During our stay we encountered a few issues:  I noticed that the day time housekeeper didn't clean bath tub, sinks and toilets for a few days in a row after our arrival. When I called the front desk and asked if that was considered a normal they sounded very apologetic and assured me it was a part of a daily routine. For the next few days the housekeeper didn't come at all or came at 2 pm sharp and I had to ask her to leave ( we had a "" do not disturb"" sign 2-4 pm for my baby's nap). I did specifically requested for the housekeeping to be completed by no later than 2 pm but that was not honored. Therefore I had to call multiple times to request the cleaning during the turndown.    Food at the pool was HORRIBLE  We only ate there twice. First time I was given a salad with DIRT on the leaves. Recent outbreak of Listeriosis in US linked to salads left 15 hospitalized and one dead. It is not acceptable at the 5-star resort and never happened to me anywhere ( we regularly stay at Peninsula Four Seasons Mandarin in US and abroad). The chef should be fired and the kitchen workers must be retrained before someone gets very sick. Second time we ate by the pool I ordered a sandwich that was delivered BURNED. These two times were enough. I took photos of both ""meals"" to show my husband who couldn't believe it was even possible at Montage...  And be aware: no other dinning options are available at the resort during the day other than at the pool and room service. So every day we had to leave the resort to take a shuttle to go get lunch. NOT RELAXING AT ALL!    Pool Attendants: while I know the pool attendants existed- I only saw/talk to one once during a 13-day stay. They were impossible to locate and we ended up taking out towels and setting up sun beds ourselves every time except one.    Shocking SPA experience:  During my massage the therapist put a hot steaming towel on my back and it hurt me. It is massage therapist's job to check on the temperature of the towel warmer. I can't see/feel it till it's too late while lying flat with my face down! When I mentioned the accident upon checking out at the spa they did the following: Offered me a 10% discount for inconvenience (!?!) and then added a mandatory 20% gratuity for the therapist. I was left speechless. And the worst part- noone ever called me to follow up on how I felt.    On our last morning we woke up hearing water streaming straight to our balcony from the unit above. I realize cleaning is important but could they wait till we check out? The soapy water was streaming everywhere covering the balcony floor and my child's toys.    Now, if all that happened in a 3-star hotel I would have moved on and said: well, I got what I paid for. But the resort is very expensive and doesn't provide what it must. I filled the survey and was emailed by a Hotel Manager who said :"" We take great pride in the service we provide and I take it personally when experiences such as yours happen.""

Our room was spotless and nicely decorated. It had its own private balcony patio which overlooks the property and blue ocean. This resort has its own private beach access which has wonderful snorkeling. We did not bring snorkeling gear for my husband and my teen daughter and I. Montage offers a free shuttle which takes you right to Maui ABC store. Thanks to this shuttle we bought snorkeling gear and lots of delicious goodies. They offer turn down service and their handmade mochi were something my daughter looked forward to every evening. They have a wonderful restaurant Kane and Kanoe (sp?) We had a wonderful dinner there. Their pools are several and you can escape the animated and noisy kid pool by relaxing in a different pool. The absolute highlight for my daughter and I was meeting Auntie Sila. She runs some wonderful cultural activities. I think it is beyond important for travellers to learn about the people and culture of the places they visit. Sila taught us to make a beautiful lei for your head.

When experiencing the loss of both parents within 3 months of each other, who were married for 70 years....this trip was one of discovery, acceptance, enjoying Maui without distractions and appreciating the life my parents gave me. Most days were just over the top, met fabulous people along the way...sometimes...while watching the sunset at Kapalua, I was feeling a bit alone...so after the sun set, I decided to keep walking and discover The Montage resort, which was newly operated since the last time I was in the area.  Awkwardly walking into the dining area, but listening to the amazing Aloha local music, drew me in...and drew me into Drew Schaffer, Restaurant Manager at Cane and Canoe restaurant. (pun intended) Drew was so authentic and so welcoming...I think he saw my hesitation and when I explained I was solo and felt a bit awkward to sit down in the dining area, that the bar area, might be better, he personally walked me over to Taylor, the bartender, and instructed her to provide their finest Mai Tai and strongest....I knew I was in good hands. Taylor was just as warm and wonderful, as we discussed the passing of my parents and her mother and we felt a kindred spirit. The Italian imported cherries were the literal icing on the Mai Tai....and it was the customer service from Taylor and Drew ( who kept coming back and checking on me)...that literally brought me to tears....I know a resort review for someone not staying on the property, this may seem silly...but when you need a little sign that you are valued and that people really care, it is no coincidence that I found that in these two representatives of The Montage. I just wanted to thank them both and the management for knowing great people and hiring them. I will be back to spend my money in more ways at the property and hopefully come back with my family, as a big room, being solo, wouldn't be a good fit on this trip.

My husband went all out on our honeymoon and I am not used to the attention we got there and having people wait on you hand and foot. It all starts as soon as you pull up to the front and the valet greets you. Those valet guys and gal are great people and the ones we spoke to the most, from coming and going on all our adventures. One day we went over to the blow hole and it was pouring down rain. I was going down a slope to read a sign and fell. When I fell I got covered in mud and hit my head HARD. My husband rushed me back to the Montage and as soon as they saw me they came to help, got me a fresh towel and wanted me to go to the hospital. I said I was okay, just sore and they encouraged me to set up an appointment at the spa. That night we had dinner there and all of a sudden I got the worst headache, the manager came to our table to check on me and then opened up the closed, locked up store and got me pain meds. Maybe I should have gone to the ER, but I did heal about a week later. ;) I just wanted to share that story because there are such great people that work there.    The grounds are incredible. It may rain a little more up that way, but that's why it's so beautiful. We went all over the island and will definitely stay here and down in Hana again.

338447585,50,Paradise,"We went to the Montage Kapalua Bay for our honeymoon, and my only regret is that we had to leave. I should have written this review months ago. I kept putting it off, but our stay was so great that I feel obligated to leave one 6 months later.    First, the setting is great. Kapalua Bay is a little out of the way, so there aren't quite the hoards of tourists you have to deal with at the big chain hotels down the coast. Yet, you're just a short (10-15 min) drive to all of the great restaurants, shopping, and activities in Lahaina.    The Montage grounds and facilities are beautiful. The huge system of pools and hot tubs and all of the landscaping around it are great. The huge spa and fitness center were awesome as well. I think my wife did a yoga class almost every morning we were there, and we had a couple's massage that was incredible.    The rooms themselves are massive... definitely bigger than they look in the pictures. Also, if you're interested in cooking yourselves at all, the full kitchens are fantastic. These are not little kitchenettes. They are extremely nice kitchens with everything from full-size refrigerators to ranges to dishwashers. In-room laundry was another huge bonus for us. Having two bathrooms (one full, one half) was also convenient. Finally, the balconies are HUGE and well furnished. Each room has its own private entrance/sitting area... You just get in the elevator and push your room number. I thought that was pretty cool.    The real gem of this place is the staff. Everyone was great, but we particularly loved Sharaya, who can generally be found in the Hana Hou House down by the pool. She is almost disturbingly cheerful and helpful, and after about 5 minutes it feels like she's known you forever. Mitch and Matt (one of which is Sharaya's boyfriend, but I can't remember), who are both bartenders in the Cane and Canoe Bar, were fantastic as well. If you just told them what you liked, they would whip something up... it didn't necessary have a name, but it was good. The fact that we remember their names six months later is a pretty big testament to the service.    The only thing I'd say is that we felt Cane and Canoe was a little over-priced. The food is actually really good and the setting is great, but they got a little aggressive on the pricing. I think the first day there we spent almost $70 on breakfast and we didn't have any cocktails.

337980652,50,A very special place,"My wife and I spent eight days at the Montage in mid October of 2015. Everything about this visit was spectacular.    After booking the trip, we were contacted via email by the hotels concierge service. They provided us with a bunch of useful information including, recommended local restaurants with details about each place, activities and tours with details and many other helpful things. They also asked for the particulars of our trip such as our flight numbers and arrival times and any special requests that we might have.    I emailed them back and asked for help planning a wedding vow renewal. They quickly got back to me with ideas and a recommendation for a local judge who could handle the service. They put us in touch with this judge and offered to help with any other details.    To backtrack a bit, we have been to Maui many times in the past and have stayed at some very nice resorts. I spent a couple of weeks researching this current trip as i wanted it to be memorable. For many different reasons I booked The Montage. It did not disappoint on any level.    Our flight from LA to Maui went without a hitch. We had waited for this trip for close to a year and we were very anxious to get the Montage. After getting a car and a few bags of groceries, we headed to the Montage. I haven't been to the Kapalua end of the island for many years and it was a nice feeling as it seems like you are driving away from everybody else.    We arrived at the Montage and pulled in the driveway. Their sign is small and once in the driveway I was a little confused on which way to turn. We noticed that someone was waiving at us so we drove towards him. Yes it was one on the valets! The valets greeted us by name and that initial contact and welcoming was the best I have experienced at any hotel. They told us to just grab our personal stuff head towards the lobby and they would handle the rest.    The Montage does not have a traditional lobby with lines to check in. They have a small pedestal with one greeter and she gave us hand towels, leis and some fresh pineapple. The view from this spot is fabulous. She quickly took us to our room and gave us tour of the amenities in our room. A few moments later our valet showed up with our luggage and groceries. He put everything away including our groceries. For us this was the best check in experience that we have ever had.    We had an ocean view 3 bedroom unit with a full kitchen, washer and dryer and a huge lanai. We were very happy with our room. we liked everything about our room-no complaints at all. Housekeeping was solid and they came at least twice a day.    The resort grounds are beautiful, very peaceful and nothing ever looks out of place. This is not a place where you will find loud pool music and kids running all over the place. This is a very quiet place where you can really relax. They were at 88% occupancy when we were there and it was like a ghost town for the first few days. Staff is everywhere when you need them but they are not in the way or pushy. They seem to try and get to know you a bit and they eventually start calling you by name.    The pool is very unique and has areas for everyone. The upper end is for adults, the lower is for families and the in between is for everybody. We really liked the pool and the pool service. The pool staff was just fantastic all week. I am sure that they are well trained but they also seemed to really like working there.    During our stay it was evident that the staff has a ""can do"" attitude towards each request. We asked our valets if they had an old ice chest that we could use one day for a beach trip. They told us that they would have something figured out by the time we came down for our car. When we came to get our car they had found a medium size container, cleaned it out and had it filled with ice. They loaded our drinks and lunches in it and we were on our way!    We used the spa facilities and found them to be exceptional. Their gym is also very nice.    The more that I reflect on our trip and stay at the Monatge the longer I could talk about it. I will be forever the biggest fan of the Montage Kapalua Bay. They helped make our trip one for the ages.

The room was great and the facilities, beach, gardens, and pool were beautiful. Our 2 bedroom suite was very comfortable and spacious with a great kitchen and handy laundry room. The bedrooms were fine but not especially luxurious. Beach is lovely, and service there is very good. But I didn’t think the service in the hotel and restaurants was particularly warm or gracious. It was not on the level of other top beach resorts internationally or even the nearby Trump in Honolulu. One example was the unwillingness to even try to give us a late checkout. The staff made no effort to see if this could happen and it was frustrating to notice that 6 hours after we checked out (we left at at the standard time as requested and hung out at the pool and beach until we had to leave for the the airport) the room had still not been touched by housekeeping.

334330928,40,Almost perfect,"I spent a week at the Montage Kapalua and as the title says, it was almost perfect.    Without question, the highlight of the entire property was Brandon, Kyle, and the entire beach crew. Every single day of our trip they seemed to go above the prior day and always beyond my expectations. They greeted us every morning with a smile and made us feel so welcomed to the beach. Simply put they were a joy to be around and made our trip. Without their warm hospitality and personalized attention the vacation would have been no different than you would expect at any resort.    As everyone else has commented the property itself is well manicured and gorgeous. We stayed in a 3 bedroom residence that was well appointed and we loved the huge lanai with a grill. The snorkeling at the bay was wonderful and full of colorful wildlife. There are 12 turtles that call the bay home so it’s never too hard to find one to swim with. I also have read some complaints about the weather that find a little excessive. It was never windy down on the beach and during our week it misted for 15 minutes total, maybe.    My one complaint was an experience we had with a member of the pool staff. We took my daughter up from the beach to swim at the pool. My wife brought her insulated water bottle from the beach up to the pool with us and we didn’t think anything about it. As we got my daughter ready to swim a member of the staff came over to tell us that they don’t allow water bottles at the pool because we could have been sneaking in a drink. We found the rule odd but would have complied and it would not have been an issue but the staff member kept piling on and shaming us for bringing outside water. He kept going and going (for what felt like 10 minutes, but in reality was more like 3 – but still quite the monologue) before implicating that bringing water to the pool was on par with going to Merriman’s (a very nice restaurant nearby) and sneaking in our own food. First, I don’t think bringing a water bottle to the pool is anything like sneaking food into a restaurant. And second, my wife was humiliated. She didn’t want to go back to the pool the rest of the week in fear of running into the staff member again. It was a horribly unfortunate encounter considering how wonderful most staff members were.

The price of the room was staggering, but there were not a lot of options. So we thought we would give it a try. The property is gorgeous and the staff is friendly and helpful. The problem is that when you are spending so much money, you want everything to be perfect. The beach is not a swimming beach and, while, nice to look at, is small and not as nice as the good beaches in Hawaii. The pools are beautiful and there are a few to choose from. Also, the buffet is not nearly as good as the Four Seasons. It may sound petty, but I was also shocked that the buffet price does not include juice or even coffee. It made me feel a bit ripped off to be paying so much money and then being charged an additional $5 for a cup of coffee.

It feels like a staying in a condo but with hotel amentities. The grounds are beautiful and peaceful. If you want to lay out on Kapalua Bay, get there early since it is a public beach and can get over crowded quickly. Renting a car is helpful exploring the island. The staff of the hotel is very accommodating and helpful. The room was clean and felt brand new. The restaurant can be overprice, but there are plenty of restaurants and grocery store near by if you want to cook. There was even a washer and dryer in the room with detergent.

331728061,50,Paradise for Upscale Families and Friends Traveling Together,"The Montage Kapalua Bay is a truly unique and wonderful property. It is an all-suite resort with 1,2,3 and 4 bedroom accommodations. Our 2 bedroom suite was incredibly beautiful and spacious with 1,700 sq ft, 2 bedrooms, 2 full baths and a 1/2 bath.  There are an interconnecting series of pools in the center of the resort, a quiet pool and restaurant at the end of the resort and a wonderful adults only pool connected to an amazing 45, sq ft spa. This property is ideal for either families of groups of friends (think 2 or 3 couples, 4 girlfriends or 3 or 4 golfing buddies).    The beach here is extremely user friendly and perfect for young children as the surf is gentle. The pools offer very gradual entry for children as well as a wonderful water slide.    Overall, the food and service here was excellent. There was not a request which the concierge was not able to arrange.    This is a property to consider when comparing it to Kea Lani on Maui (about equal in cost) or to the Four Seasons (considerably higher rates).    Of course, no resort is perfect. It would be nice if The Montage had an alternative dining venue for dinner.

It was a honeymoon and Maui wedding trip and the staff was amazing! They helped celebrate our event throughout the week with surprises such as complimentary champagne, chocolate covered strawberries, and a beautiful tropical bouquet of flowers! The suite was immaculate and had a fantastic view of the ocean. The place was not overly crowded as some resorts are. The pools and landscaping are some of the best I've seen anywhere. The Kapalua Bay has some of the finest snorkeling on the island. Rental of snorkel equipment was available on the beach for $10 for two hours worth of snorkeling. The wide variety of tropical fish in the bay with the sighting of two large sea turtles were more impressive than the charter boat snorkel trip I took on another day. The food at Cane and Canoe was very very good. I had a kitchen with coffee maker and enjoyed making freshly brewed Maui grown coffee every morning. Whenever I called for my rental jeep, it was waiting for me by the time I got to the lobby. I read the reviews that mention that it rains a lot and found this to be true, however the rain lasted no more than five minutes and was usually more of a mist. And it was always accompanied by a lovely rainbow afterward. I never found it to be a deterrent.

I booked a one Bedroom Premier Beach View room, we were in room 3407. When the door opened and my wife saw the view she started to tear up because it was so Beautiful....a better word was Heavenly. Now the cost was Global but it was worth every dollar. The service was outstanding from the Valet to the housekeeping staff with excellent service. The unit was so clean it was shocking from the bathrooms in which we had 1 1/2 to the outdoor lanai which was 20 feet long and 15 feet deep.it had an outdoor table and chairs and a day bed that fit two and a set of two lounge chairs with a small table to hold our drinks. This is not a hotel room in the general sense this is a home with a complete kitchen, Living room, bedroom, full bath, half bath and a complete utility room with a HE washer and dryer and detergent and dryer sheets. You do not return home with any dirty clothes. The Spa is world class along with the Gym which is very clean and has all new equipment We had the couples massage which was pricey but well worth it, I haven't had an ache or pain since I had the massage and actually felt stronger in the gym since the massage, who knew? The spa had its own pool, hot tub and was very quiet and peaceful, along with the smells and oils and scenery it was a wonderful experience. I hate to admit it but it was probably the best massage I have ever had . I made this confession to the wife and received a, I told you so!  I am so Glad we stayed here, it was wonderful....

From a fully equipped kitchen to massive bath tabs to huge shower to second toilets and laundry room. Our room was cleaned and refreshed daily during our week stay.  The staff…omg…were beyond attentive, courteous, polite and very educational about what to do in Maui, called us by our names from the moment we drove up to the valet to the concierge and even the grounds keep. To be sincerely honest, we can’t find the right words to describe our experience. The customer service at this location is second to none that I have experienced in similar properties. We couldn’t mention all the wonderful staff at the Montage by name, but Andrew in housekeeping and Ted at the concierge are just a few staff members that we want to send a shout out to, but honestly, they all deserved a HUGE KUDOS!

320750042,50,Absolutely stunning hotel with amazing customer service,"We just returned from a one-week stay at the Montage and I am still reveling in the luxurious hotel and exquisite customer service. We had toyed around with staying at the various hotels in Wailea or Kapalua, but the Montage ultimately won out, as we were looking for a mellow, relaxed, quiet place to stay instead of the hectic vibe. We couldn’t have made a better choice.    First, let’s just get the price point out of the way. Yes, this hotel is insanely expensive (5th most expensive in the world, apparently) and yes, every aspect of it is pricey, from the resort fee to the valet fee to the food/beverage costs. BUT, I did a lot of searching of Maui hotels and it seemed like most mid-range places cost about $400-500/night, and the other upper-echelon hotels like Four Seasons and Ritz cost almost as much as Montage. The hotel overall is amazing, and when I look back, it’s all these extra little touches (which I’ll get to) which really made the Montage stand out as far and away the best hotel on the island.    In the weeks leading up to our trip, we received emails from the hotel concierge to check on our arrival time, if we needed help planning anything, did we plan on renting a car, etc. We felt acknowledged and welcomed before even stepping foot on the property. When we did arrive, an employee was waiting for us with cool towels, fresh pineapple, and a lei for me/beads for for my boyfriend. They do most of the check-in in your actual room, which is a nice change of pace instead of making you stand at a desk for extra time (plus you need their help to find your room the first time anyway!). We had a one-bedroom ocean view suite, and it was spectacular. They gave us a tour of the room when we arrived, plus we had an abundance of complimentary fresh fruit and coffee, as well as little creamers in the fridge.    The suites are quite large and extremely comfortable — we loved the bed and the blackout curtains. The balcony area was bigger than any other hotels, with a big lanai, a dining table, lounge chairs, and regular upright chairs. It was roomy and perfect for breakfast and coffee in the morning. The bathtub was luxuriously deep, and the shower is really nice. All the appliances in the kitchen are high quality, plus anything you can of is provided, such as a potato peeler, a strainer, a cocktail mixer, etc. The rooms have DirectTV which is great, although my one complaint on this is that the cable box is inside a cabinet, so the remote has a hard time picking up a signal unless you leave the cabinet door open.    The pool area was so fabulous that we rarely wanted to leave the resort. All the different little pools offered an intimate feel as opposed to a huge pool where everyone is congregated. The temperature was perfect — refreshingly cool but not cold — and the little waterfalls and grottos were a nice touch. We never had to fight for chairs, although there were a couple days where we had to do a couple laps before we found some. The pool attendants are great though and will help you find chairs if you’re having trouble, and they didn’t bat an eye when we said we were hoping for something quieter after they first found us seats near the “family” pool. They completely understood our desire to be in a less noisy part of the pool area. I cannot speak highly enough of the pool attendants, in particular, Whitney. They all knew our names after only one visit to the pool, and they made sure to check on us often. Whitney was great at giving us drink recommendations and making sure we enjoyed our choices. They also have pool attendants who walk around handing out little samples of foods like pineapples with coconut cream, bananas and nutella, salted nuts, dried fruit, etc. This is one of those small touches I really appreciated, as we weren’t always very hungry at the pool but it was nice to be offered little bites here and there.    We didn’t eat at the pool so I can’t comment on their food, but we did eat one breakfast and one dinner at Cane & Canoe. The breakfast menu has a nice selection and our waitress Erin was very friendly. Another nice touch was the little squash muffin we received while we waited for our food. We both enjoyed our dishes immensely. Dinner was also delicious, although it felt a bit overpriced for the amount of food you received, such as the ceviche appetizer which was no more than a few forkfuls of food. The setting of the restaurant is great though with the large tables and umbrellas overlooking the Montage property and ocean, and it’s even better at night with the tiki torches lit and live music playing.    On Tuesday nights they do a manager’s reception at the Beach Club with free drinks and snacks, and we enjoyed the opportunity to chat with the different managers, who were all very down to earth and happy. Also — very strong mai tais!    Maid service is very thorough — they would do our dishes and run the dishwasher, even if we didn’t use much. They also adorably wrap your cords and put little ribbons with bows on them so they’re not all tangled in your things. They would do turndown service every night, leaving you a schedule of activities for the next day, plus a little candy by your bed.    The men who worked the valet station were outstanding and I wish I had gotten all their names. They also remembered our names and would give us helpful directions to places, beach towels when they knew we were going to the beach, etc. When we checked out and were leaving for the airport, they gave us bottles of water and baseball caps. The woman who worked the valet desk outside (again, I wish I got her name!) was wonderful as well. One night when we mentioned we were going to Lahaina Grill for dinner, she very quickly gave us a coupon for a free dessert and recommended to us her favorite one. We thought that was incredibly sweet since it wasn’t as though the restaurant was on property.    We went to the beach one day and the employees there were great as well, quick to set up chairs and umbrella for us, even though it was starting to rain. Unfortunately that same day the rain got so heavy that it ruined their little shack and we didn’t see them again the rest of the week.    The fitness club/spa is very well furnished with lots of machines — not the standard couple treadmills and random weight machines — along with fresh fruit and iced towels to cool you down. We didn’t use the spa services at all but we were quite tempted. The spa has its own quiet infinity pool, plus hot tub, eucalyptus steam room, etc. It would be a wonderful place to spend a rainy day.    I could go on and on (I already have!) about all the things I loved about the Montage. Overall, while the final bill did cause a bit of a heart palpitation, I can say that I feel Montage was worth every single penny. We left Maui completely relaxed and well cared for, and we loved every aspect of the hotel. It is most definitely worth the splurge, and if I went back to Maui, I would be hard-pressed to stay anywhere but here. Thank you, Montage, for an amazing week in Maui!!",Oct 2015,October 2015,Traveled as a couple,"None of the rooms seemed bad, although I believe Buildings 1 and 5 get you closest to the ocean.","Salt Lake City, Utah"
320385440,50,Lovely Destination for Families Seeking Quiet Paradise,"We stayed at the Montage for 8 nights Oct 2015 2 adults and 2 kids 12 and 8. If you like understated quality and top service, and don't mind paying for it, this is the hotel for you on Maui. We have previously stayed at the Ritz in Maui and chose the Montage because the rooms are better suited for families with kitchens, washer/dryer, etc. The rooms really are giant portioned condo with all the amenities you could ask for. We booked a garden view room thinking it would be great for the kids to get right out onto the grass and play -- we were upgraded to a full on ocean view without mention which was pretty terrific. The outdoor space was huge -- biggest balcony at a hotel I've ever seen with table and chairs, 2 chairs, 2 lounges, and a giant round bed. Kids loved it!    The pools were nice -- we swam every day. There were always chairs available (but a large number of chairs are ""reserved"" meaning you have to pay extra for the premium spot with the best view which I think is silly for a high end resort to nickel and dime you on a pool chair -- besides I never say anyone occupy those ""reserved"" chairs in 8 days so it is a waste of space). We also loved the expansive green lawns everywhere -- kids played in the grass in the evening and lots of other kids joined in. Kids also joined the daily cultural activities -- lei making, tide pool walk, hula lessons - and really enjoyed. Also there is a large koi pond at the entrance and they feed the fish daily at 9:30 which is a hit with kids. The beaches - so you can walk easily to Kapalua Bay beach which is adjacent to the hotel. It is a protected calm bay with soft sand - good for snorkeling and swimming with minimal waves. Sadly when we were there they had a big storm that knocked down the stairs to the beach and damaged the gear rental shack -- no snorkels to rent or chairs available as a result. However, this was already on the mend the day we were leaving so hopefully they will be back in business soon. The other big beach is Fleming beach by the Ritz. We honestly prefer this beach as it is better for boogie boarding with waves. It's a bit of a hike from the Montage (you can use the lovely Kapalua waterfront trail) or the Montage is happy to run you there in a shuttle.    A bit about the fitness center / spa - the facilities are comprehensive. As a resort guest you have complimentary access to the fitness center, spa pool and locker room facilities including hot tub, steam and sauna. The gym facilities are comprehensive with all equipment you would need. They also offer classes for $14 a session - quality is sound. Lots of good hilly running options around Kapalua too.    The service, amenities and location of this resort are all undoubtedly 5 star. No party vibe here -- very sedate and refined. We arrived at 9pm on a Sunday night and didn't see another person at the pool, restaurant, lobby area or any of the pathways -- felt like a ghost town. Very quiet and low key. Being said that it is a top quality property, there are a few small things that we noted during out stay that could enhance the experience even more...  1) There really isn't anywhere to watch the sunset and have a drink... the pool bars closed at 5pm when the sunset at 6pm and the lobby bar is tucked in the bottom of the hotel with limited view. People would buy a drink and mill around but the resort didn't make it easy. Why not keep one of the pool bars open until 7pm and continue to offer the pool menu as well? It would have made a great place to have a drink AND offered an alternative to Cane & Canoe to families that wanted a kid-friendly or light meal.  2) Service was very solid at the hotel eventually but in the first few days many staff members made us feel like intruders on the property. For example, you would stop by the beach club and ask for a few towels to take to the beach and the staff member would give you the sly eye and say ""are you a guest here?"" I found it a bit affronting mostly because of the delivery -- maybe start with ""certainly - and what room are you staying in?"" - something more personal and welcoming... over time this lessened as the staff recognized us but the first few days it felt a bit snobby and un welcoming.  3) The property condition is 5 star but just on the verge of needing some maintenance to stay there... the outside could use some pressure washing -- dirty stucco, dirty pool chair cushions, etc. I noticed small things throughout - broken lamp shade over pool table, warped teak chairs outdoors, food stained cushion in Cane & Canoe.    Again, this will be our go-to place in Maui. It really suits our preference for quiet, well equipped, high quality accommodation and service. I hope the property is able to maintain its high standard over time.",Oct 2015,October 2015,,,"Sammamish, Washington"
319975497,40,It's all about the money,"The Montage in Kapalua is a business. The business is money. If you expect warm and friendly, go elsewhere. The location, rooms, pool, facilities are all 5 star. The service is a little inconsistent, but overall, quite good. But you can't help by feeling it's just about the money. At the pool, rent a day bed and two chaise lounges for $300 per day. We were there two weeks, saw them used once. However, the best location at the pools are reserved for those who wish to plunk down an extra $300. A hot dog is $17. You pay for parking and gave a resort fee.  A family we met there were checking out after two weeks. Their tab was north of $25,000. They had a late flight, asked for a late checkout. Nope. 1 hour. Another two hours would be $250. Are you kidding me. We let them use our room.  There are a lot of positives, location and facilities. But they've lost that loving feeling that was there when the Ritz managed things. We won't be back, not for $1-2,000 per day. You walk away feeling that they did you a favor by letting you stay there.",Oct 2015,October 2015,,,"Glocester, Rhode Island"
318177718,50,Best experience ... ever!,"Just completed an amazing week with my family of five at the Montage Kapalua Bay. We had a very spacial partial open view two bedroom suite and I am struggling to find a single issue with our stay. ALL members of the staff were very obliging and friendly, and almost without fail I was mentioned by name on my second encounter with each one. Given the size of the resort this level of recognition was amazing. The pool area was great for both the kids and adults and the beach provided a great change of scenery, with great snorkelling. Unlike other resort pools there wasn't a mad dash to reserve seats. This could have something to do with travelling in October but it was a refreshing change.  The Montage is impeccably maintained both from a building and garden perspective. My wife and I had a lovely meal at the Cane & Canoe, not a standout but still very nice.

The first thing I want to note about this property- it was built and conceived as a luxury condominium/fractional ownership concept, not a hotel. Therefore the ""rooms"" are absolutely enormous and all have full kitchens, separate bedrooms, living rooms, and dining areas. I'm guessing our one bedroom suite was over 1000 sq ft. It was lovely but for two people on a romantic weekend getaway it was overkill.    During our visit the property had a rather sedate family vibe, wonderful if that's what you're looking for but don't expect an energetic pool or bar/lounge scene at The Montage. It's more about luxury family fun where the kids can play at the pool all day while the parents/grandparents can play golf or go to the spa. It felt like the majority of patrons on property were on multigenerational holidays. The staff were all great, very professional and helpful without being intrusive.    Dining at Cane and Canoe was adequate but not inspiring, Merriman's and Lahaina Grill are much better options if you're looking for delicious local cuisine. Our specific suite could have used some updating, the furniture and decor felt very 2005 but that could simply be the taste of the owner and not reflective of the resort in general.    Overall we had a great weekend and were satisfied with everything at The Montage, in this price range I would give it a slightly above average grade but in my opinion it's not among the best properties in Hawaii (see my review of the Four Seasons Hualalai).    As I've said it's a good option for families needing lots of space or looking to entertain but not so good for a younger couple in search of an energetic hotel experience. Hope this helps!",Oct 2015,October 2015,Traveled as a couple,,"Kauai, Hawaii"
318145285,50,Family visit,"This place is the most beautiful hotel villa that one can imagine , service is fabulous , every one from doorman to room service treated us like Royal family, the beach is great for snorkeling but not so sandy for swimming, I will definitely go back as a large group, I think this place is too quiet for younger people who want to enjoy a little hip vibe, the pools were close to empty with no music, bars were quiet and closed early how ever the drinks and bartenders were fantastic , I can't wait to go back",Oct 2015,October 2015,Traveled with family,,"Tustin, California"
317305812,50,I WANT TO LIVE HERE,"My husband and I just returned from our third stay at the Montage Kapalua Bay. As frequent travelers to Maui for over twenty years, we have become very attached to a few places on island and feel a lot of loyalty to those particular places. The Montage Kapalua has surpassed all those places in our heart and takes its place at the top of our list now. It is hands down our favorite place to stay anywhere! I cannot rave enough about this fabulous property and the staff! From the stunning landscaping and gorgeous well kept grounds, to its oceanfront setting, the over the top mind blowing swimming pool, and last but not least the super comfortable luxurious rooms, we have finally found our perfect place.    Every single staff member we encountered went out of their way to help us and assist us, even if it was just to spend time talking with us. The housekeeping staff does an amazing job of keeping your room crisp and clean, with wonderful little touches like plenty of waters, top notch Kapalua Bay Blend coffee that I really miss now that I am back home, little cubes of mochi at turndown with a new Hawaiian word to learn each night, organizing the cords to our phone and computer chargers and tying little bows on them, washing up our dishes, their hard work shines through every day, as does that of the hard working grounds keeping staff. The Montage looks like a million bucks at any time of day with so much dedication to cleanliness and aesthetic beauty.    The front desk staff, valets, pool attendants, wait staff, all of these people were a pleasure to see and deal with daily. A special shout out to Beth, Lubi and Whitney at the swimming pool every day - so welcoming and fun to spend the day with them as they work hard to make all of us on the pool deck happy and comfortable! Wonderful Katie who brought our breakfast to our room most mornings. She took it upon herself to get some lilikoi curd specially made for me when i mentioned how much I loved it. The Montage used to have lilikoi curd as part of their jam and jelly selection, but stopped serving it. One day she appeared with not one but two jars specially made by the pastry chef for me and a little decorated coconut shell cup also! I was so touched by this gesture and Katie - if you read this - we miss you! :-( Michelle Vogele was a real standout at the Montage. Several times a day she would circulate through the grounds passing out all sorts of wonderful amenities like fruit and nutella, banana chips she made and dehydrated herself, salted mixed nuts, jello, and her fantastic homemade trail mix. I still think about the delicious trail mix. Michelle is an absolute wealth of information regarding Maui's culture and history and a true gem at this already amazing resort. At the end of our stay I felt she was a long time dear friend of mine that I would miss very much. Because of these wonderful and hard working employees all the guests at the Montage have nothing to do but just sit back, relax and let the magic of Kapalua sink in! I will be counting down the days until I can return to this paradise!",Oct 2015,September 2015,Traveled as a couple,,"Nashville, Tennessee"
317296569,50,Honeymoon stay -- this place was beyond our expectations,"We were initially skeptical about going to Hawaii for our honeymoon. We felt it was cliche and that there are so many other places to visit around the world. Due to some timing and trying to maximize our time at the hotel vs. flying for days, we landed in Maui at the Montage Kapalua.    Some insight:    - Beyond beautiful  - The grounds are incredibly well maintained  - Awesome pools, 3 tiers in the main area and then a more secluded one on the walk south to Merriman's  - Just an overall amazing property that makes you feel relaxed and comfortable the minute you walk in  - Bell boy staff was beyond great to us. They made recommendations, helped with activities, and were genuinely caring and sincere about making sure our stay was a great as possible. They provided towels for hiking days and were definitely a highlight of our trip, in the form of customer service.  - Rooms are incredible, they turn the down 2-3 times a day. Fold shirts, tie ribbon on chargers, refresh waters. Full kitchen, washer and dryer so you don't have to bring tons of clothes if your there for a long stay. Awesome huge balcony. Great living room and bedroom. Bathroom is also great and even have a 1/2 bath additional just in case. Nice to have a wine fridge and full sub zero fridge to toss some beverages since Maui night time dies down early.  - Spa is beautiful. Great gym with super new equipment and even views of the ocean from the treadmill. Yoga room is even more beautiful and kind of made me wish I took up the hobby. Great little coffee/juice bar in the spa too that was delicious.  -Great beaches near the hotel ( 1 south, and 2 north along the Coastal Trail)  -Walk over to Cliff House area and get a floatie and just hang out and jump off cliff (lots of locals on weekends fyi)  - Hotel has great access to Merriman's, which was our favorite place to eat on the trip. They will drive you over in the golf cart or you can walk on the lit trail by Kapalua Beach (approx 5 minute walk)  - Also there are tons of places to drive to. Probably 20 places to go within a 20 minute drive. Plus Cane and Canoe if you want to be a homebody    Overall this place exceeded our expectations. Workers were genuinely caring and wanted to get to know you as well as assist you in any way possible. This can often feel over the top, but this was natural and they really just care about your stay. We will be back and have recommended it to all of our friends and family. It is a 5 star hotel and the best on Maui. If you think otherwise, you are too uptight and just look for problems rather than enjoying your stay at one of the most beautiful places out there!",Oct 2015,September 2015,Traveled as a couple,"Ocean view, but really this hotel is spectacular and you will spend most of your time outdoors","Nashville, Tennessee"
316784549,50,Not just Maui's but Hawaii's ALL-STAR!,"There is no better hotel on Maui than the Montage. The hotel enthusiast that I am, I took a trip to the Wailea area-Grand Wailea, Four Seasons, Andaz, and Fairmont. In my opinion Wailea is becoming the next Kaanapali beach, the exclusiveness is being overrun by crowds and makes Maui feel more like Disney than a vacation. I also visited Kapalua-Ritz Carlton, and in Kaanapali beach the Hyatt, Sheraton, Westin. Hands down the Kapalua area is the greatest, with the Montage having the best location on the island. No other hotel compares with grounds, design, rooms, pools, beach, and views,-Montage has it all. It is a large property and with a lot to be discovered but everywhere is easy to get around, and you will always feel like you are in your own private oasis. Montage staff sets the standard in service not just in Hawaii but pretty much every 5 star hotel I've stayed in the world. It's no wonder that within a year of opening they overthrew Four Seasons for the #1 in Maui.  The pictures of the hotel will not do full justice to the beauty of the Montage.  -Rooms are LARGE and have every amenity.  -Food -delicious for every meal.  -The pool is the best I've seen. Gorgeous 3 tier with incredible views, waterfalls, etc. The top level is the adults only section with a separate food and bar area (plus for adults without children).  -The grounds are Montage's best asset- LUSH and well maintained. Out of every Maui property the Montage has the most flowers, plants and grounds. Its a tropical paradise something a comparable in Kapalua, the Ritz, lacks.  -The beach- Kapalua bay is breathtaking with clear blue water ideal for snorkeling with views of Molokai and Lanai on the horizon. Most resort beaches in Maui lack this bright clear turquoise water and light sand.  -Service-Outstanding! As 3 guests 2 of us slept in the one bedroom while the other in the living room pull out, but 2 days in the hotel left flowers and wine apologizing for the inconvenience the living room pull out was causing on our room experience, so they opened the 2nd bedroom complimentary!  The staff at the restaurants and poolside were incredible, genuine and professional without the stuffiness some high end resorts can have. Whitney was great poolside and we were lucky to have her!  Housekeeping untangled our charger wires and placed them in a bow:) (it's the little things that further impressed me)  -Gym- Large, clean and very impressive for a hotel gym. The Spa areas were also very clean and nice. Just a little more pricey for treatments than your average 5 star hotel.    PS- check out the path along the oceanfront. It leads to cliff and trail areas with breathtaking views, ideal for a morning hike or a romantic sunset, not to be missed!    Montage I miss you and already planning my return! You have made it hard to vacation anywhere else because I'm not sure I will find a gem like you for a while!",Oct 2015,September 2015,Traveled with family,,new york
315940303,40,Maybe 4 stars,"Maybe we were there on an off week, however, this property has some kinks to work out before we would consider it a 5 star resort.    This is a bit of a list...  We booked through Amex Fine Hotels & Resorts. With this, guests should receive certain perks, including an upgrade if available. We booked an ""Ocean View"" with the hopes of getting a ""Premium Ocean View"". When shown our room, the lanai was over crowded with furniture and at best, had a ""Palm Tree View"". Although the resort was nowhere near capacity, there was no upgrade. A picture from our room accompanies this review. Also on the lanai, the cushion for the sofa lounge was severely stained. Quite a turn off.    Upon entering the master bedroom, one of the chairs was also stained and there was a hair on the wall in the shower... awful! The fringe on the sofa pillows was coming apart and when putting on a bathrobe, there was a large ball of masking tape glued to the sleeve that must have been in the dryer! All things that could have been corrected with minimal effort before guests take occupancy.    Once we had been in the room for a few hours, we noticed the air conditioning was not functioning properly. The maintenance person came and closed off rooms that were not being used to force air into living space but he said the system has a max low temp of 72 degrees to avoid humidity and preserve the wood floors...??? Ironically, these are the same floors that are outside when you check in and if by chance they would be damaged by a/c, then perhaps they should not be in a tropical resort. Additionally, if our house was at 72 it would be an igloo, so I have to believe that the thermostats themselves are not accurate. The room temperature did finally drop on day 4 making it more comfortable.    Cane and Canoe was overpriced and far from outstanding, even for Maui standards. There are other great restaurants in the immediate area that are worth a visit.    Billing cannot be viewed online or on the TV and when checking out, we noticed there were several errors and also a $20 per night parking fee. When questioned, the parking fee was removed but every little problem had to be escalated to a manager who would get back to you. Annoying.    On the up side...  The service was lovely, especially at the pool area and the housekeeping staff who attended the room during our stay were outstanding.    The room was spacious and the kitchen was beautiful. We did not cook but it was nice to have a fridge and the delicious local coffee provided by Montage.    The grounds are beautifully manicured and the pools are lovely, quiet and well kept.    Overall...  We visited several other resorts on the island and will stay at a different hotel on our next visit.",Oct 2015,September 2015,Traveled as a couple,,"Scottsdale, Arizona"

The units are extremely spacious and have just about every amenity you can think of. It was like living in a luxury apartment; in fact, after a few days we were ready to just stay and make it our home! The grounds are unbelievably beautiful. They spared no expense on the landscaping. They have swimming pools everywhere you look, and each one is amazing and fun to enjoy and explore. You don't have to go far to get a great tropical drink because they have bars around the pools. And their bartenders rock; no watered-down resort drinks there!    As good as all of that is, the staff is even better. Service at the Montage is simply impeccable. Everyone...even the groundskeepers and cleaning ladies...are there to pamper you in any way they can. I should mention the beach; it's OK, not the best, but certainly worth checking out. The best part of the beach was the snorkeling; there's lots of beautiful fish everywhere.    The only blemish on the Montage is the Cane and Canoe restaurant. See my separate review of it, but I'll just say here that it was quite unimpressive. I guess there's no such thing as perfection, although the Montage comes close!

We were there for a week, in a 2 bedroom and the lanai and views were amazing. The chair and a half chaise was my go to spot to watch sunrise and sunset. The place is so spacious and beds were extremely comfortable, From the minute you pull up until you leave, you are treated like royalty. Cold waters, directions, help with seat belt and even baseball caps upon checkout from the valet guys. The housekeeping is discreet, cheerful and spotless. The pool staff was also very accommodating, setting up chaises and bringing us water and frozen grapes, little extras that we really appreciated. They also made the best drinks and were interesting to talk to. The adult pool is so serene and peaceful and my nephews loved the kids pool and how shallow it was. We used the gym almost daily and it was probably the nicest spa/gym I have been to associated with a hotel. The grounds are stunning, the BBQ areas were useful and everyone working there seemed very helpful and happy. There are beautiful walking trails that follow the coastline with an abundance of cute geckos.

307572519,50,Perfect. Private. Paradise.,"We have been coming to Maui every year for 19 years, and since the 4 Seasons has gone steadily downhill, the Kea Lani has been taken over by families/kids, Ritz Carlton isn't close enough to the ocean, and the Grand Wailea is sadly showing her age, I was thrilled to see the Montage here. We have one here in Deer Valley so I had no reservations whatsoever in booking this place. How do you put into words impeccable service, responsive staff, breathtaking grounds, large beautiful rooms, fabulous spa and wonderful food? From the valets out front who soon know your name, have bottled water ready and an umbrella if it looks like it might rain, to the pool staff, it feels as if there are 2 employees for every 1 guest. There is nothing better than laying out by the Adults Only pool where it's quiet, drink in hand and just soaking up the ocean air. The pools are tiered and wind around, providing countless private areas. Like a 'secret garden' with pools. Our room had a fully-equipped kitchen, washer/dryer, dining room, massive living room, giant lanei, huge bathroom, closet and master bedroom. The mattress was a little soft for my husband's back so housekeeping brought a mattress board within 15 minutes and he slept like a baby. We were in building 4, top floor. The elevator pops you out at your door - no other unit on your floor. Kiha the bartender is wonderful as are all of the servers who frequently check on you to bring fresh water, small snacks and to bring you anything your heart desires. We rented snorkeling gear and paddle boards down at the beach - super nice guys working there. Smallish beach, but for us it was perfect. We spent 90% of our time at the pool. We had massages at the spa, and used the gym on a daily basis. The gym is large and houses the latest equipment. A large room upstairs holds classes you can sign up for. Juice bar, clothing, and beauty products right by the entrance. There's even an infinity pool by the spa so that you can swim after having your massage. The detail that went into the design of this resort is astounding - it's as if the design was intended to make every guest feel as if they were they were the only ones on the property. The winding paths and landscaping are amazing - every day I'd discover something I hadn't seen the day before. This is our 'go-to' and I truly hope that the Montage can maintain this level of service and quality. We plan on bringing our adult married kids with us next year - this is definitely a place to share with those you love. Thank you Nick and all of your staff for making our 10 days so special.

We have 2 boys ages 7 and 13 and the other family has boys 4,9 and 11. So we new it would be an active vacation! First of all the greeting at arrival was wonderful. You felt like you were coming home. They greet you with a lei, cool towels and a drink. They had stuffed animals for the kids to choose. This is an all residence property with only 40 or so units. So it never feels crowded or chaotic. We never had to reserve a lounge chair early at the pool, wait for a table in the restaurant, wait in a line, get a servers attention, etc. We were told they were at capacity so we were experiencing it a busy time, but it never felt busy.  The units are spacious, nicely decorated and very comfortable, big kitchens and well stocked. We dined out but often found it easy with the kids to cook in and then watch the sunset on the lanai. The lanai is huge and the circular lounge bed on each units lanai is perfect to relax on and read. It also includes a dining table and 4 lounge chairs.  What really makes this property stand out is the staff, service and the amazing setting.  Our boys had a great time playing football on the large lawn overlooking the ocean.

298593704,50,Awesome experience! - feels like you are in your own private resort,"We stayed for only 2 nights at the end of a 6 night stay in Maui and wished we could have stayed at least a couple nights more. We took advantage of a golf promotion where two rounds of golf were included in a bundled room rate. Property is amazing - the grounds and rooms are very well appointed and kept up and service very friendly. We also stayed at the Four Seasons Wailea and thought service a bit better (all relative) but Montage was still fabulous. The Montage feels much more exclusive and private - in part because there were much fewer people there. However, it is also due to the hugeness of the rooms/suites which are actually size of an apartment with separate bedroom(s) from a large living room, dining area and kitchen and 1 1/2 bathrooms. One of the best aspects of the room is the very large balconies that overlook the grounds/pool area with the ocean in the distance. We had considered staying at the Ritz Carlton instead but decided to splurge on the Montage and so glad we did - the Montage is much closer to the ocean and is much more intimate. The pool areas are nice but particularly the adult serenity pool. The main pool that kids can use is pretty small and would not recommend this property for kids/families as it seems there isn't much for them to do - would recommend the Fairmont Kea Lani or Grand Wailea - but is awesome for couples. One of the negatives is the beach area is not immediately in front of the property but is slightly adjacent and a few minute walk away. While there are lounges and umbrellas on the beach that are for use by the hotel guests, the beach area is not nearly as nice as Wailea Beach and the Four Seasons or Grand Wailea. It is not very deep with the lounges right up against the bank and there aren't any waves to speak of as bay protected by some reefs. It is good for snorkeling though and you can rent a stand up paddle board which is good in the AM. The wind picks up in the afternoon. Would love to come back. Another negative is not being able to check in a bit early - we arrived around 2:00 pm and room wasn't ready till after 3:00 pm, despite the resort seeming empty. And, we weren't able to extend check out beyond 11:00 am, not even till noon, which seemed unreasonable and not consistent with the rest of our experience during our stay. There isn't much of a bar scene (none really that I saw other than at the pool which had people sitting at) and there was only one restaurant on property. However, bell service was great, picked up our luggage when we needed to check out and packed our car and had it waiting an hour or so later after we had spent a bit more time at the pool after vacating the room.

The grounds, pools, and rooms are beautiful-the beach and snorkeling are excellent also. We visited the spa on both visits several times and had great experiences with the services.    Here is the issue that has really disappointed us-we booked this trip through our Platinum American Express which guarantees a 4PM checkout. When we asked about that we were told that they couldn't honor that but if we wanted to stay until 2PM they could do that for $150-really???

But after having a disappointing visit at a resort in California, it made me realize how truly great I had it at my stay at the Montage in Maui. I can not say enough about this resort. I've traveled all over and have never had a better experience at a resort. The moment you walk in you feel relaxed and at home. Not only is the property breathtaking, but the level of service is second to none. The staff is so welcoming and the rooms are amazing! I found myself between the pool and bay all day, but spent a lot of time at the pool bar! As a mom of three on vacation with my best friend of 40 years, I was able to truly relax....Kiha became one of our best friends for the week and made us feel like family.

294792196,50,Family & Friends @ Kapalua Montage,"We just finished two weeks at Kapalua Montage - 5 families and 27 people in total. Our first visit since Montage took over the management of the property (we visited a number of times before that).    Great to see so many good friends who have worked with the property since the beginning - Khia, Janet, Ted, Daren, Aiyami, Jeff, Lubi, etc. All are excellent members of the Montage experience and make it such a special place to visit for our family. We met new friends like Matt at the Cane & Canoe bar, Henry at the Sunset bar and Chris on the pool deck.    Special kudos to David Hoffman and his staff - the property looked great and service levels were fantastic.    Has to be the best property in Hawaii and a great place to use as a base for family and friends!    Maholo!",Aug 2015,August 2015,Traveled with friends,,"New York City, New York"
293155695,50,Captivating views! Beautiful resort and amazing staff!,"Ted, our personal concierge, welcomed us with cool cloths upon arrival. He then presented us with beads and a flower lei to welcome us to Montage. He provided us with information on excursions and assisted us in procuring a charter for deep sea fishing. This was not an easy task and we didn't think it would happen. After a couple of days, it worked out due to a last minute cancellation. The resort and grounds are absolutely beautiful! Our room was on the fourth floor and provided views that were second to none. The room had all the amenities our family of 4 needed. Our first meal there, while waiting for our room, was at the little pool bar. Jessica was our waitress and gave wonderful suggestions for beverages and food. She is kind and patient and quickly became our favorite waitress. While everything at Montage is beautiful, it is the staff here that make the difference. Their attention to detail, kindness and warmth made our family feel at home. Kiha makes the best 1944 Mai Tai.. However, it was his ability to draw my 12 yr. old son out of his shell that made the biggest impression on me. Henry, a bartender we met by the serenity pool, took the time, after hearing that my boys wanted to fish, to come in early at 7:30 am and make that happen for them. Brian, took us on a tide pool walk and patiently answered all of our questions. We held hermit crabs, a sea cucumber and sea urchins. He even loaned body boards to my boys so they could go out and try to ride some waves! The pools are all beautiful, but we didn't use them. The beach is right out the door and thats where we wanted to be. We were fortunate enough to experience snorkeling with the sea turtles on several occasions! There are puffer fish, eel and colorful little fish everywhere! Kiha, Jessica, Henry and Brian gave us great tips on places to go and things to do. We loved it here so much we are already planning the next time we can come back to this beautiful resort and wonderful people!",Jul 2015,July 2015,Traveled with family,,"Scottsdale, Arizona"
292819044,50,You'll love it more each day!,"Being a big fan of the Beverly Hills and Laguna Beach locations, we were very excited to try the new Kapalua Bay resort. If you are familiar with those locations, I would curb your expectations a little. While the resort is spectacular, it does not have the ""Montage"" feel that the California hotels do. The explanation is understandable though, the Montage took over the Kapalua Bay complex after the bankruptcy of the previous owners. So it wasn't built with that Montage touch you might be familiar with.    The main difference is that the rooms have a ""condo"" feel to them rather than a hotel resort feel. While initially put off by it, it grew on us each day. The rooms are very large with a fully stocked and luxurious kitchen. The verandas are roomy and beach/Molokai views are amazing. The bedroom decor was the most disappointing, it was very plain and just lacked character. The in-room washer and dryer are most appreciative during a long stay. The bed was not that comfortable at all, it was lumpy from a mattress pad and sheets the didn't seem to fit properly.    The beach access is second to none. Being a public beach, it can get a bit crowded, but you won't find a better place to snorkel anywhere. The beach crew takes good care of hotel guests and we never had a problem getting a good spot.    The pools are phenomenal for families, lots of different levels and places to hide. A larger and deeper adult pool would be great, but the one on-site was rarely crowded and mostly peaceful.    We loved having access to the trails along the beach. Taking daily walks to the Dragons Teeth was the highlight of the day.    Breakfast was decent, but it would have been great to have a buffet instead of a rather limited menu. Lunch at the pool bar was really good and dinner at the restaurant is recommended to try once.    Overall, you can't beat the setting and good service. We went as a couple, but we saw a lot of families here having a blast. We look forward to bringing the kids out next time.",Jul 2015,July 2015,Traveled as a couple,Prime beach views on higher floors are worth the extra price.,"Leesburg, Virginia"
291923763,50,Paradise! Wonderful Hotel and Absolutely Beautiful!,"This hotel is absolutely amazing. We were a group of 9, so we stayed in a 3 bedroom, 3 1/2 bathroom residence. It was very spacious.    We did have one issue while we were at the hotel but it was resolved. When we arrived, we were in a unit on the 2nd floor in building 1 and the air conditioner did not work. They had an engineer come look at it and he could not get it to work. We spoke to Ted who was our ""personal concierge"" and he told us that it would probably start working the next day. Well, it was 80 degrees in the unit, which was way too hot, so we had to ask to speak to a manager. The manager, Justin, ended up finding up a unit in building 2, so we moved to that unit the next day. This was a hassle since we had to pack up our bags and move the next day but we were happy that the air conditioner in that unit worked. We would have preferred building 1 because it's location is perfect since it is in between the beach and the pool, but we picked air conditioning over the location. After this issue, we never heard from our ""personal concierge"" for the entire trip, so that was kind of a disappointment, but we just made reservations for restaurants on our own.    Besides this issue, the other 10 days we spent at the resort was fantastic!  Pools: The hotel says there are 4 pools, but it actually feels like there are even more than that. There are 3 tiers of pools that you see from the lobby. The very top tier is for adults only. The 2nd and 3rd tiers are for anyone. The 2nd tier pool is actually made up of many pools. There are many areas that you can go to, to have almost your own little private area. Then the 3rd tier is the largest of the pools and that is the one we spent most of our time at since we had 3 kids with us. The one side of the pool has steps that get gradually deeper, which was nice because the kids could get in and out on their own and we even laid on the top two stairs to get sun while still in the water.    Canopy Beds: We had a canopy bed each day which was nice, but they are pricey. $300 per day. We had someone with us that needs to be in the shade though, so we got one every day.    Beach: The beach is very nice. There are areas where there are not a lot of rocks or coral, so you do not have to wear water shoes like you do on some of the beaches to the south. Since this beach is part of a bay, it does not really get waves though so this was good and bad. It was good because even our 3 year old felt comfortable enough to go into the ocean but then our 6 and 8 year olds were disappointed because they didn't get to use their boogie boards. My husband did snorkel at this beach and he say some amazing fish, eel, squid, etc. He did not see a turtle but another person at the beach did see one. The beach crew is very helpful and it was nice that the chairs and the umbrellas were included in the daily resort fee so you didn't have to worry about paying them every day.    Grounds: The grounds of this hotel are absolutely beautiful. It is a more natural looking landscape than some other hotels in the area. The grounds are well kept and are very pretty.    Staff: Everyone we met at this resort was very friendly and helpful. Everyone goes out of their way to help you. The servers at the pool came around numerous times to see if we needed anything.    Food: We did not eat at the main restaurant because we didn't think the menu sounded very appealing and it was mostly empty every night, so we just made reservations elsewhere. We did eat at the pool though almost every day because of connivence. The food is definitely over-priced but it is pretty good and it is nice to not have to leave the resort for lunch. A cheeseburger was $22, so when you have a group of 9 people, it can get very pricey.    Sunsets: Sunsets are gorgeous at this hotel. We could see it directly from our room and we also watched it on the beach. When we watched it on the beach, we could see turtles' heads popping out of the water every so often, which was also pretty cool.    Atmosphere: The atmosphere here was very nice. It looked like such a huge resort when we were looking at pics online, so we were worried that it was going to be so crowded, but we were there for 11 days and it never really felt crowded. There were even times that we were the only ones in the pool, which was very nice.    Overall, we loved this hotel and we absolutely want to go back and stay here again. We would definitely recommend this hotel!",Jul 2015,July 2015,Traveled with family,,Illinois

Ted recommended excursions, dining and helped my husband with golf reservations. Every single piece of this process was seamless. As we were headed to the resort, I casually mentioned that I was disappointed that I had not been given real floral lei during the trip. The minute we walked into the lobby, that was rectified.

288705808,50,Sets the Standard for All Other Maui Properties,"We've stayed at Montage in Laguna Beach several times so we came to Maui with high expectations that were met and exceed. Definitely an amazing 6 nights thanks to wonderful staff and an amazing property. It's an amazing escape from reality; albeit a very pricey one. We will be back.    The awesome:  --Location... no question about it one of the best locations on the island. Great beach/bay that even worked well with our 4 year-old and not as hot as Lahaina and Kaanaapali. Yet close to everything that West Maui has to offer.  --The room... High end appliances in the kitchen (Wolfe and SubZero) and tons of space. Natural stone in the bathrooms and walk-in closets for all bedrooms (we toured the larger model before leaving.) We had a one-bedroom for 3 people and it must have been over 1200 square feet and a huge lanai with daybed and dining table. Plus can we ever go back to not having a washer and dryer in the room for a Hawaiian vacation? No.  --The pool. OK it's not the Grand Wailea since there are not slides and other water attractions but other than that its just a good. Three levels and tons of natural rock grottos and river like areas to explore with kids.  --The service. Friendly, warm service from everyone... valets, pool attendants and so on. Know you by name quickly, made tons of fun moments for our daughter and everyone seems to enjoy being at work. Fantastic experience before the trip as well; the concierge team gets all of your requests and we arranged for groceries to be in the room on arrival which was worth the small fee. Our concierge Ayami (although I never met her in-person) did a fantastic job and made all arrangements before our arrival. Heck they will even unload the dishes and put them away for you.  --Uncrowded. Because the units are large and there aren't too many of them (I heard 175 but not sure that is exactly right) the resort is never crowded. At first we kind of missed the hustle and bustle and our daughter had a hard time finding friends to play with. After a day or two she found the kids and it was awesome.  --Pacific Dream photography... partner with the hotel to do family photography and they did incredible work. Having those pictures is one of the trip highlights.    Things to know:    --If you've been to other Montage locations this one is definitely more residential feeling versus a hotel feel. Yet there's all the things you would expect like room service, restaurants and so on. Neither good nor bad.  --A bit more rain on this far north part of the island. We had a few hours of rain most mornings which we enjoyed.

288308240,50,Kapalua,We stayed at the Montage with another family in their 3 bedroom condo. The 8 of us had more than enough personal space and comfort. The resort pool is fantastic for kids and adults with plenty of private sitting areas to relax. There is absolutely no need to worry about finding a place to sit with a limited amount of guests present at all times of day. We spent more time at the pool than beach for this very reason as the beach is public. The snorkeling at the beach is fantastic and the kids got a close encounter with a sea turtle. The waves are minimal with a good surf break present. The beach is all sand but a short ways into the water it becomes coral and difficult to wade past waist deep.

288051275,50,Ahhhh!!! Relaxing and first class.,"We are back from our one week stay. We are a family with teenagers and we often make last minute travel plans. We chose Montage for our first time to Maui quickly based on reviews here - thank you TA! As soon as we arrived in the lobby I knew this was a special place. Beautifuls leis, cool towels, drinks and a great view. Then we saw our condo. This space is first class, beautifully laid out - and the lanai is perfect. Plenty of furniture on the lanai for lounging and eating. This was possibly my favorite spot. The view of the ocean and lush grounds is perfect. The beds are very comfortable, kitchen is well stocked. Housekeeping comes twice a day and is excellent.  We had mentioned my husband was fighting a cold - complimentary tea service was sent to our room quickly. This is one example of the attentive service provided at this resort. We asked a valet where we might be able to vaccuum the piles of sand from our car - he immediately took on the job. And did a superb job - the car looked like it had been detailed. We spent lots of time at the pool and beach. Shout out to Whitney at the pool for her excellent service.  Our older kids loved the pool - lots of different parts to explore. The path, rocks and beach by the hotel provided plenty of activity when we wanted it. We snorkled, kayaked and swam.  This is a quieter, upscale resort. If you are looking for a loud activities director in the pool area, this is not the place for you. This feels like a boutique hotel. You do not need to get up early and save chairs by the pool. When the staff sees you arrive at the pool, they begin setting up chairs for you. This is a discreet hotel providing superior service. We drove to Lahaina - a short trip - when we wanted ot be in the hub-bub. Typically when we travel we like to leave the resort often to explore- we had to push ourselves to leave this haven. This property feels like it is a secret space that hasn't been discovered yet. I hope it always feels like this. The restaurant is beautiful and delicious. Excellent service. We also did the photo shoot with James. Excellent. I highly recommend it.  Before this trip, my favorite warm weather destination was Turks and Caicos. Now I am not sure. I like to visit each location just once - there is a whole world to see after all. Yet, I would return to Montage in a minute.

By the time we walked from the lobby to the entrance, our car was waiting for us. Can't say enough about the level of service from all the staff. In addition to being a wonderful place to go for a romantic retreat, this was a resort that did much more than tolerate children. They have included lovely features that honor and respect children as people. My boys really enjoyed Friday night out at Paintbox and earning their Montage badges. How thoughtful! There's a separate pool just for adults and then a very cool family pool with small caves, waterfalls, and bridges.

285963597,40,Montage & Pacific Dream Photography is the BEST in Maui!!,"We recently stayed at the montage for my birthday and 10 year wedding anniversary. Upon arrival, we were instantly in AWE!!  The impressive covered entranceway with its stunning woodwork details, front koi pond, and a view of the infinity pool that blended seamlessly into the ocean. The landscaped grounds were nothing short of impeccable. The adult serenity pool was our saviour as we spent many hours of our day there. The suite was a gorgeous ocean view.    Pacific Dream Photography-5/5!!!  With Ben as our photographer, was definitely one of the highlights of our trip. We were in some serious laughter and good company the entire time!! We even ended up jumping in the pool at the end of the shoot and still, he got fantastic shots! When we met with James early the next day, he had everything all ready to go, even a spectacular video montage of some of our best images put to the most perfect music. We were blown away. James was so accommodating, and has even assisted us since our purchase with prompt responses everytime. If you're staying at the Montage, DO NOT pass on the complimentary shoot with Pacific Dreams Photography!! The pictures will turn out amazing! I assure you, you'll be missing out on a memorable experience if you do.    So everything sounds great why not 5 stars for the Montage??...Here is the major reason why we gave it 4 stars. The suite was large and well appointed, however we did encounter concerns and inconsistencies with housekeeping, as well as some ""utility"" problems in the suite as well. As soon as we walked into the suite, I noticed it had been cleaned less then acceptable for what you'd expect in a 5 star resort. Sticky cabinets, dirty floors, crumbs on the counter, silverware had ""stuff"" stuck to them, clearly visible stains on the sectional, chair and outdoor sofa on the lanai. Luckily i came prepared ahead of time, but I shouldn't have had to sweep, use Lysol wipes on all the cabinetry doors and pulls, put all the cutlery thru the dishwasher, and have the sheets changed even before my first sleep in them. This left a bad taste in our mouth right off the bat. Jordan was great in housekeepingd did go the extra mile in getting me laundry soap and organic toiletries and a left nice note, so this was appreciated, but still this is something we shouldn't have had to deal with at all. The time of daily housekeeping we requested sometimes worked out correctly, sometimes not, as they'd wake us up early, or be there when we'd be eating lunch. Not convienent either was. As another reviewer stated, we also had a/c that didn't get very cool, and we were told by maintenance that it was a set temp-(20* Celsius) and it wouldn't get cooler then that...we're from Canada, and 20*C is a hot day here! The nights were tough to sleep in that set temp especially if you'd been out baking all day in the sun enjoying all that Maui has to offer! Basically all our visit, we had room frustrations. Also we were never shown around the property as we saw many of the other conceierge's do with new guests, we were given a map for a self tour. Our itinerary was incorrect and not updated when we got there, as well as we were never shown the spa and fitness facilities and explained what exactly we were able to use during our stay. We ventured up there ourselves just before we were leaving, and got a great tour, where then the employees explained what we had...unlimited gym access, the sauna, the outdoor pool spa, saltwater pools, showers, lockers etc...all for free!! We'd missed out on this our entire trip because I guess they'd like you to purchase a treatment instead. Not cool. And finally, we were aware that there was a complimentary photo shoot with Pacific Dreams Photography included when you stay at the montage, but no one ever directed us or mentioned to us how/when to book etc. The courteous desk staff working nightshift apologized, and admitted that somebody should have contacted us and set up a time! We were lucky we got in the night before we left...to think we could have missed out on again one of the best experiences of our trip, would have been a big regret.    We expected nothing but perfection and flawlessness from all the online reviewers, and thought for what we were paying a night here, it should be, but in our experience it wasn't, I'm sad to say.    However, we still gave it a very high rating for many of the things they did exceptionally and we didn't want all the above to ruin our long awaited holiday. ALL, and I mean ALL the outdoor areas, the lush beautiful landscaping were impeccably maintained. Extremely well kept walkways, gorgeous evening ambiance lighting in all the pools, fire torches everywhere, the outdoor pool washrooms were immaculate (better then inside the rooms), the adult Serenity pool alone would have us coming back time and time again. The pool staff was fantastic, particularly Whitney, and it was so well planned to have the kids pool at the bottom. It gave a nice large area for family's to spread out and enjoy, there is another bar down there to purchase drinks and food from, so that kept all the foot traffic away, and wouldn't overflow into the serenity pool area. So smart we can't say enought about it! Kids could run around freely down there and be loud if they'd like and it didn't disturb us in the slightest. We did a day trip down to Grand Wailea, another resort we considered, and their pool area was atrocious! There must have been nearly 150-200 people jammed so tightly in rows, all their stuff on top of each other, beach bags falling over etc, that it reminded us of a movie theatre. You know when you go out for popcorn mid movie, and like 15 people have to stand up and you have to do the shimmy just to get out!! Thats exactly what it was like!! It was so hectic and loud, we couldn't walk by fast enough! So glad we didn't go there!!  Also, people say the weather isn't nice up in Kapalua, but the weather our entire trip was sunny and beautiful, with a nice light breeze to keep you comfortable when outside. It was PERFECT!  We played a little bit on the putting green, and enjoyed the evening sunset walks. We saw a ton of turtles at Dragons Tooth, just a short walk away, and even meandered our way down all our 5 swimming pools and hung out in the waterfalls, under the bridges, and hot tub. There a a TON of different areas to lounge on, nice sunny and shaded areas, they provide chair covers and towels as  well as sunscreen. Our dinner at Cane & Canoe, although pricey, so delicious. Sansei right up the road, best off resort meal in Maui hands down. There was far more positives then negatives, and we toured the other 5 star resorts we considered prior to booking the Montage, and even though we had the above happen to us, we'd never stay anywhere else other than the Montage. We are planning on booking again for this November...we'll just make sure its a different room this time! Haha",Jul 2015,June 2015,Traveled as a couple,,

284547603,50,Montage is Marvelous,"I enjoy the Kapalua side of Maui. I really enjoy the Montage Kapalua Bay. The Residences at the Montage Kapalua Bay I really, really appreciated. We stayed in a four bedroom, ocean front residence with a large balcony that accommodated an outdoor dining table for 10 and a large grill. The views of the water from the master bedroom, patio, living room and kitchen were unobstructed and two of the other bedrooms had very nice, if slightly obstructed views of the ocean. The residence was professionally decorated and outfitted with all of the amenities expected from a Montage in addition to everything a couple or family would need to run a household including laundry detergent for the full size washer and dryer, pots and pans, dishwashers and even cold milk for your morning coffee or tea. Just add food and beverages and your Hawaiian vacation is as close to a perfect start as you could wish. A four bedroom has three rooms with either a king or queen bed and one bedroom with two queen beds - I think they were queens, if not the beds were fulls. Room than enough room for eight adults or if the kids can double up, six adults and four kids.    The location is on the previous site of the Ritz Carlton Residences also previously known as the Kapalua Bay Hotel. The hotel is wrapped around the bay which allows for amazing sunsets and views of Lanai and Molokai.    The staff is very accommodating and ready to help with every request. The team at the Beach Crew is outstanding and provide all of the gear needed for snorkeling, kayaking, paddle boarding, just about every water sport guests would like to experience. Beach chairs and towels and light snacks are also available at the Beach Crew.    The spa is very nice and I enjoyed the massage service and the massage room. The open air reception are in the spa is very tropical with another beautiful view of Kapalua Bay. Maybe I missed it, but I did not see a relaxation room, but did spend a few minutes in the outdoor/downstairs waiting area with a water feature and island breeze. Perfectly soothing.    The pool has several covered daybeds that are available for rental. The rental includes a bucket of water bottles, a nice fruit tray and several lounge chairs. Several daybeds are located in their own little areas and offered a sense of exclusivity. There are no private cabanas at the pool. The alcoholic drinks - this may seem to be an odd topic, but the drinks were actually drinks. No need to order double or triples as one is occasionally inclined to do at other resort pools. Great drinks.    The hotel restaurant is open air with tables ""outside"" under umbrellas and the remaining tables ""inside."" The restaurant has a nice menu and the service is genuine.

The residences were beautiful and very well equipped. The grounds were gorgeous and well maintained. The pool was a visual delight, beautiful by day and night. The beach and snorkeling were great. The prescription snorkel goggles available there were much appreciated by some of our grandchildren. The staff knew us by name and were extemely friendly. Valet parking was superb.

280188399,30,"""Great Hotel...Needs Quality Improvements""","Pay attention to this review before you book!!!  I normally don't post a review unless I really feel a need.    Pros: Suites have most of the amenities from home.  Room Service is Excellent.  Food was very good!  Front desk staff; exemplars of amazing customer service skills.  -Thank you Nicole for making my B-day exceptional, great room.  Grounds are well kept.  Beach is within walking distance and great for snorkeling.    Cons: Suite has everything except for a beach bag??? How is it possible that in a place where vacationers are spending most of their time on the beach you don't provide a beach bag? If you didn't bring one your told to purchase one in the Market located on property: Bags >$75.Your already charging me a daily $30 hotel fee, this is a strange charge that is not part of taxes its just applied- for God knows what...why not give your customer a bag.  Pool service is extremely slow, and forget about them coming to you and checking on you if you need a drink you need to walk over to bar, by the way you're getting a watered down drink be prepared for 15-18 dollars. If you want a cabana you need to pay $300.00 per day and be ready with the sun block the cabana gives you zero shelter from sun and all they provide is fruit and water. You have zero privacy and at these prices; come on!! I expected more and better service. The pool personnel act like this is my vacation, don't bother me by asking me for something. I know you work in paradise but make an effort to make your customers feel relaxed and special. Montage invest in some customer service training it will go a long way. You want to claim 5 star status but the customer service you provide is now where near the four seasons.  Beach: Gorgeous beach for snorkeling, be ready with aqua shoes tons of rocks just steps from the shore and you cant escape them anywhere in the bay. There are some small 10X10 (aprox.) areas you can take a dip, but be ready to share your space with several people trying to do the same. These areas are small and crowded. Beach Service: The guys are nice and will set up a chair and umbrella for you if your staying at the hotel. There is no other services provided, pack a snack and some water in your beach bag (that you bought in the Market) and you'll be fine. So sad that once again a hotel that claims to be one of the best and is extremely expensive has zero beach service.  Lastly, this really bothered me and made me feel like I wasn't welcome. Everytime I would approach someone in the hotel for service they would ask me: Are you staying here???? This would happen at the bar, pool, and beach. I understand the beach because it belongs to the Hawaiians. I've stayed at five star resorts that place a wrist band to identify their guest, all they would ask for is my room number (for charging purposes). I've also been to hotels 5 star hotels (i.e. Eden Rock in Cap Cana) that know your name the moment you walk up to their main entry. Because of this annoyance that really bothered me and left an everlasting bad impression in my mind and experience. I will never return to the Montage nor would I recommend this hotel.    This hotel for its price point and category (five star so they say), needs to improve their customer service delivery; interactions with guest, services provided at pool side. Invest in your staff, conduct some customer service workshops or in-services. Everyone at Montage should be in line with your mission and vision, not just a handful.    Thank you Nicole (giving us a great room with a nice view), room service staff, and housekeeping. These people made my experience memorable and if it wasn't for their service I would have had a very expensive and horrible bday/vacation.",Jun 2015,June 2015,Traveled as a couple,"First floor is best, birds come up in the morning and it's a nice way to start your day.",NYC
279861455,50,Best Maui experience for a family vacation,"Excellent in every facet! The rooms are awesome as they were meant to be residences and not hotel rooms - spacious, with full kitchens, furnished balconies with an awesome view of Molokai, Lanai and Kapalua Bay.    The staff is first rate from the arrival at the bell stand to the concierge to the pool staff and restaurant waiters and bartenders!    At the Hana Hou Bar, Kiha is delivering excellent services and ""Sharpie Tattoos"" for the children. Henry and Sharaya are keeping everyone happy and entertained, ordering us our customized version of our lunches and making sure we have everything we need.    Brian, Ashely and Sherri take excellent care of our two children in PaintBox and have them wanting to come back every day.

279743796,50,Exquisite property. Top notch service.,"We stayed for four nights in June in a two bedroom, high floor villa. The views are unbeatable. The rooms are very large and comfortable with all the best amenities but there is nothing stuffy or formal about them (I always hate beach hotels that feel pompous). The grounds are immaculate. The beach is smallish but has some of the best snorkeling imaginable. You can also walk down a path just outside the hotel and watch locals jump off fifty foot rocks into amazing clear blue water. Theoretically a visitor could do that as well or, more prudently, repair to the bar for grilled naan and awesome cocktails. The area where this property really stands out is service. The pre arrival staff was more responsive than Four Seasons or Fairmont (we are staying there later this trip) and every excursion they booked was top notch from zip lining to private scuba charters. The staff is very engaged and really seem to care that you are having a pleasant stay. The food is quite good. Some things like the corn (really) and the salads are world class. Others are just good but service is always top notch. Room service is insanely fast. And the surfing goat cheesecake is so far the best thing we have eaten this trip. Finally do the Pacific Dreams photo shoot. It's fun fast and they take amazing pictures. Mahalo Montage for an amazing stay.",Jun 2015,June 2015,,,
279535703,50,The worst part about this resort is.....,"The worst part about this resort is...seeing it in your rear-view mirror as you're leaving for the airport! My experience in travel is backed by many years in the hotel, food & beverage industry. Without a doubt, our visit to Montage Kapalua has been the best. What they do on a daily basis cannot be trained in some people. It has to come with natural talent & Montage Kapalua obviously spent its time sourcing the best talent available. From the moment we arrived in our rental jeep, we were greeted by name & a smile, led over a moat brimming with koi, to a pavilion where a very able concierge met us with fresh pineapple, cold water & cold, scented hand-towels. This was a prelude to slow down & get ready to indulge in relaxation- which is what we needed. Our suite was nothing short of spartan clean, well appointed, comfy beds, couches, upgraded toiletries, robes, large LED TV's & a fully equipped kitchen where we prepared our breakfast & lunch everyday = $ saved (we dined out for dinner every night). Our view was a 4th floor suite & provided a gorgeous view of both pool & ocean. What's impressive is; the elevator takes you to your own private corridor for your suite, so there's less noise outside your suite.  Because this property is so detailed, allow me to address the areas as follows:  1) Overall property: Excellent example of architecture, landscaping & main pool. The main pool is not advertised much on-line by the resort, but I can approximate that the pool cost well over a million dollars to construct. It has everything from waterfalls to various levels of depth, to cold & hot Jacuzzi's and small ports for privacy. The pool staff is as sharp as the pool itself. Being an old athlete, I casually opened my pool-side umbrella for some shade. I was quickly approached by a staff member who asked; ""who opened the umbrella?"". My wife & I found it appreciable that the staff member was so concerned over me opening the umbrella. She assured us that this was not our job & she was there to do it. Another pool-side caveat is free ice-water brought around by servers (most resorts charge for this). We also enjoyed the ""snack girl"" who seemed to appear out of nowhere with her daily version of complimentary trail-mix or frozen grapes. Towel service was on top & all the cabana boys knew everything about the property. They even had 30SPF sun-screen, just in case you forgot your own. Make a note to NOT book a snorkel trip outside of what the resort has in front of it- the best snorkeling. All the snorkel tours come to the bays around the resort, which you have FREE walking access to. Rent snorkel gear @ the beach for nominal charge & explore on your own. The best reefs are right in front of the Montage & we saw sea-turtles every dive. Ask the super-cool guys @ Kapalua Bay Beach Crew (Montage's beach) for the Outrigger Canoe Experience. Such a cool experience. You (and 5 others) paddle the outrigger out & into the bays to snorkel. You see turtles, urchins & sea cucumbers & the crew takes great underwater pics of your family. Such a great experience. As for a beach, the beach is well groomed & popular. The Beach Crew is stellar in assisting your every need- including racing my teenaged son every day to keep him ready for football! Do stand-up paddle boards & snorkeling with them, they're the best.  2) The suite: overly spacious, well appointed furnishings & decoration, large lanai, sub-zero fridge & all the plates & utensils you need to do meals...even bar-ware with blender. The bedding is pillow-top with an array of pillows, foam or feather. House-keeping is on top of their game,always leaving fresh flowers & small momentos of Hawaii; which were regional snacks with a small Hawaiian quote of the day attached. It seemed house-keeping always knew what needed to be thrown away -vs- what needed to be kept.  3) Bar & restaurant: very well decorated, quiet & prompt, knowledgeable servers bring everything to life. Tiki torches & fire-bowls reflected off the pool nearest the restaurant/bar area @ night added that extra touch of uniqueness. Every entree & cocktail we had on property was innovative & exceptional. The bartenders where we played billiards almost every night were knowledgeable of product & projected a fun atmosphere. We also dined in-suite one night, which proved to be even better than going out!  4) Resort Fee & Parking: The $30.00 resort fee broke down to $10.00 each day for my family of three. If you have more family, then it's even a better deal for you. What Montage doesn't tell you is; there are so many things to do on or near that property, that for $30 a day, it becomes cheap entertainment. There's ocean-front hiking or jogging all around the property, there's free walking access to snorkel in the finest bays, there's rock cliffs to jump off (we did) & there's always some kind of game near the pool (volleyball, golf putting, bean-bag toss) that you can get involved in to whittle away time with your family. There's also the beach with all it's water-sports, which incur an additional small fee, but worth it. Basically, you need not venture far to have outdoor fun here. The valet service is top-notch, always running for the car when they see me approaching, without me ever asking. They also checked with us every time we left property to make sure we had towels, bottled water (which they gave us) & much need directions or driving tips. Sure, free parking is what we all dream of, but we don't get it on the mainland, so why expect it on an island in the middle of the Pacific?  5) The staff: All genuinely sincere & happy to be there. Anytime I called for assistance, the phone was always answered on nothing later than a 2nd ring. The concierge staff is all pro! They tolerated my scheduling changes, always nailed a reservation for me & gave me valuable input on restaurants and/or excursions. Even the landscaping crews who I saw on early mornings toiling away in the gardens, always stood up & greeted me with a smile. On one occasion, I was having morning coffee on my lanai & a man from housekeeping was walking below. I heard someone say ""Aloha"" & I looked around to see who it was or whom he was speaking to. To my surprise, it was only me the man was speaking to...I replied back with a raspy...""aloha"" & then laughed about it later with my wife. The bottom line is; the staff cares enough to go out of their way to recognize you & impart hospitality.  I came to Montage Kapalua as both a first timer to Maui & to the Montage brand. What my family experienced was far more than what I could have imagined...a flawless vacation that brought smiles & made everlasting memories...everyday of our stay. These are the things that are priceless & one should feel blessed to have experienced.",Jun 2015,May 2015,Traveled with family,,Louisiana
279268322,40,I'm ambivalent on this one,"This was the hardest resort I've had to review. I thought about why. It is because it is inconsistent. There are aspects that are wonderful and some that are mediocre.  Service was inconsistent. It ranged from a contrived familiarity to downright unfriendly. We arrived, pulled up and were greeted by our names and professional titles even though we had never met these folks before nor did we make the reservation under our professional titles. I guess they searched us on the internet before arriving. It was odd to me, but I guess some might be flattered by that Disneyesque attention. Then within 24 hrs of arrival and our first trip to the pool carrying distinctive glasses from the room and resort towels we were looked at (or really past) and snidely asked by the pool staff member if we were guests of the resort and those drinks are not allowed and ""name and room number"".  Facilities are really very good. As you may know, this was a Ritz Carlton Residencies which did not sell in the great recession and Montage acquired and runs the 50 some odd unsold units as a hotel. The infrastructure is top notch although not perfect--some of the outside wood features are peeling their varnish, rust on some utility doors and utility area door handles are weathered. Couches in our room showed multiple stains as well as the one cushioned lounger there was on the lanai. Furnishings are great and decoration is simple elegant but the lanai furniture is not of same caliber. If you have a room with a view you are likely to spend some time on the lanai and unfortunately , with the exception of the purchased residences, they are furnished with lower end plastic topped tables and tubular aluminum chairs and loungers (no cushions).  Housekeeping is twice daily and most days was exceptional but, again, some days was not--forgetting to leave soap and not cleaning floors where there were crumbs.  The pool is probably one of the best on the island as far as design with the exception of the Grand Wailaea which has a huge pool great for kids. The pool was fairly busy but they were at near full capacity. There is an adult pool separate from the main pool but it is down by the beach without much view. We avoided it after the run in with the staff there the first day. Main pool has a ""Serenity"" adult only and no cell phone area at the top -- great spot! Unfortunately, true to the inconsistencies, cell phones were used (not just quick calls--long and loud conversations) and kids still did venture in or near the pool. Sometimes they were gently asked to leave but only to move over to the lunch area that is right there and they'd end up running around the ""adult"" area anyway. There are small, quiet areas, little nooks, with loungers amongst the foliage and waterfalls but most are ""reserved"" and an additional $300 a day which includes some amenities.  The beach at the resort is called Kapalua Bay Beach. It is a public beach. It is a very narrow beach and can pretty nearly disappear in high surf/tide/swell. It is crowded universally due to it's diminutive width. There is an activity shack that will provide towels to Montage guests and set up loungers-- if space allows. You can call down early in the day and have it set up and held for you if you really want to hang at this beach (we didn't--better options--see below). Towels and loungers are included in the resort fee but the watersports equipment is not-this is an independent operation that works with the resort.  Ate breakfast all 8 days at the resort and it was very good. They are programmed to offer you the ""pressed juice"" when taking drink orders. Almost got us the first day on this. it is $12--just FYI. Oddly and annoyingly they reserve tables for some guests at breakfast.  TIPS:  --this is a resort for those who like to hang at the pool mostly, it is not on a good beach.  --If you do stay here and like beaches, ask the valets to bring you over to the beach in front of the Ironwoods community (Ironwoods Beach) in the golf cart, or drive over (early) and you might be lucky enough to get one of the few public parking spots right next to the entry gate to Ironwoods. The beach is wide (for Maui) and long and not crowded. You will see turtles here most days nibbling on the algae/growth on some of the flat rocks/ledges that cover the shoreline just under very clear water. We got our own beach chairs from COSTCO--right near the airport, but I heard the resort may have some left from prior guest you can borrow. Walk back (carefully)along the seashore path in front of the Kapalua Villas--gorgeous views.  --If you book a plan that includes a room upgrade ""if available at time of check-in"", you should resign yourself to the fact that this really is a low probability event. The rooms are few and are 90-95% booked usually I was told. There was no compensatory offering or even an offer to open the 3rd bedroom (locked off) in a 2 bdr unit, or even a final response to an inquiry about the lack of that benefit.  --If you answer the concierge's pre-visit email and let them know what you are celebrating with your stay don't expect too much fanfare. We went with our two kids--one graduated HS and the other had a 20th Bday. The Bday girl got a ~3 day old cupcake and his graduation went unrecognized.  --This is my 6th trip to Maui and I do prefer Kapalua over the other resort areas on the island because of its beauty and relative quiet. Truly 5 star is the Ritz Carlton Hotel where I have stayed before (was booked up when we checked for our current visit). But if you are looking for quiet and a place more condo-like then consider the Kapalua Villas. They are privately owned but organized by quality level of fit and furnishings as well as graded by location to the cliff edge/ocean view. They are located above one end of the Ironwoods Beach. They are a more economical, relaxed option and when we stayed in a Gold Oceanfront unit a few years ago came with resort access to the Ritz Carlton. I don't know if that is true anymore.  --If you do choose the Montage just slightly lower your expectations as the tripadvisor ratings seem hyped to me. Our experience did not match what we would consider to be a genuine and consistent 5 stars.",Jun 2015,June 2015,Traveled with family,"This is a sprawling multi-building, multistory condohotel with various orientations.

278178376,10,"""Private"" beach that isn't","We've been coming to the Kapalua bay beach for 20 years and during that time we've stayed at the ritz and various condos in Kapalua and Napili. There has always been a shack on the beach that would offer to rent chairs, umbrellas, kayaks, SUPs, snorkel gear and sold ice cream and sodas. They were always polite about beach etiquette, never setting out chairs and umbrellas until someone was actually there to rent them, and definitely always respectful of people who put their things down first (not putting chairs and umbrellas right in front of you etc. Now that it is managed by the Kapalua montage that has all changed. Even if you get to the beach early, count on Kapalua montage resort staff setting resort chairs and umbrellas literally right in front of your spot...one even told my wife this morning that it's a ""private"" beach. Obviously he didn't know what he was talking about and his own colleagues corrected him - but not until after he had already behaved very aggressively and rudely. Wow - real aloha spirit over here at the new montage ""private"" beach (which isn't). It seems montage doesn't understand that corporate sustainability also means respecting the existing Kapalua community and people who already call this place home. The employee never apologized and we ended up spending the entire day with a narrowed view of the ocean and a much smaller spot for the kids to play in (which I woke up at 6am to get!). If you're an elitist snob looking for a way to experience resort staff cutting in line on your behalf (hey I realize some folks like that feeling) then you should feel right at home at the montage in Kapalua. If you would rather come to Maui to chill out among those who like to breathe the same air as everyone else and enjoy respecting others while being respected, and not having your chill day with the family messed up by rude staff working the beach, best to sadly pick another spot. Or come here and protest their assertion of ownership over a public coastline, which is what we ended up doing.",Jun 2015,June 2015,,,"Austin, Texas"

We arrived in the evening before our first day and stayed by the airport. Arrive the next morning before noon to Montage with you swim suit ready and begin enjoying the resort ( pool, beach, food ) before your room is ready. They will store your bags until later.

273571642,50,"Yes, truly Excellent, but needs a few minor tweaks","Just back from 4 nights in a lovely one-bedroom ocean view villa at the Montage Kapalua.    First bit of advice. Don't formulate your review until your last day here.    Having been a very satisfied, frequent patron of both So Cal Montage Hotels (Beverly Hills & Laguna), my expectation for this property was for a true Hawaii resort feel (In a good way). Much to my disappointment, on day one, didn't catch this feeling. Not sure what, but something felt amiss. Nonetheless, by the end of our stay, I came to learn that the non-resort feel of this place was the true beauty of this property. The serenity of the grounds and location here are simply sublime.    (For a reality check, we visited the Ritz Carlton. Sadly, that property now feels like a Vegas convention property. Was very happy that we chose the Montage).    First the great:    1. The villa is beautiful and fully equipped - kitchen, amenities, living area, washing machine and dryer, etc.  2. Housekeeping is fully on top of their game - well done!  3. Service throughout the resort is impeccable and very accommodating to every  request  4. The spa is second to none. Facility and therapists are superb.  5. The grounds are spectacular and beautifully maintained. Kapalua is heaven on earth.  6. WiFi - unbelievable how many of the high end resorts charge these days for WiFi. Thank you Montage for not charging!    And the minor tweaks    1. Food is good, not great. Would like to see a greater variety of choices - particularly fresh fish (sushi/sashimi, ceviche) - and restaurants  2. Serve food at the spa pool, and provide coffee and tea service in the lobby  3. DirectTV is great, but at least provide HBO and NBCSN in the villas (so I don't have to watch English Premier League matches and ""Game of Thrones"" on my iPad - I know, big problem to have). These channels were available in the gym    When all is said and done, there is no better place to stay in Kapalua. This place is beautiful. Don't hesitate to book.

The balcony overlooked the grounds of the property with a view of the ocean. There was an adults only infinity pool. Food was great as well.

Jeremia greeted us upon check in. Just a few more names to call out- James- with Pacific Dreams Photography- just AWESOME! Whitney, Rob, Chris and Beth... just to name a few of the wonderful staff.  I would definitely recommend this property to anyone looking for the best of the best. Our names were remembered by the staff.  WOW..I almost forgot to mention the SPA.

272832698,50,Magical Stay in Kapalua,"My boyfriend and I just returned from an 8-night stay at the Montage Kapalua where we celebrated my 40th birthday in the height of Hawaiian style and luxury. I cannot speak highly enough about this resort.  We arrived late after a long day of travel from Michigan. We were tired but were greeted warmly and efficiently by the valet, concierge and front desk staff. We were presented with kukui nut leis and offered fruit and beverages. Check in was fast and friendly and we were whisked off to our home for the next week.  The room was exceptional. I had reserved a one-bedroom residence but were delighted to be upgraded, without mention, to a 2 bedroom unit. The room was immaculate and the lanai, which I am calling my favorite part of my Maui vacation, was enormous. Every morning was spent on this lanai, drinking coffee and watching the sun rise over Molokai.  A charming ""cake"" made from colorful towels awaited us as well as Happy Birthday cupcakes (real) and a bottle of Montage sparkling wine. Such nice gifts.  The property was flawless. The pools beautiful. Quick walk down to the beach for snorkeling or sunbathing.  We didn't eat in the restaurant, but spent one Happy Hour at the hotel bar and were so pleased with the excellent service.  The kitchen has every utensil and appliance you could desire. Two small bags of coffee are included -one regular, one decaf. Our morning sunrise ritual meant that we went through it rather quickly. We were informed by our housekeeper that we would be charged if we wanted it refilled. I will say that this surprised me a bit, but no harm done. We simply went to the store for more coffee.  This was our first time staying on Maui and will certainly not be our last. We will be back and Montage will be our home-in-paradise again.",May 2015,May 2015,Traveled as a couple,All rooms appeared to have beautiful views and amazing lanais,"Venice, Florida"
272241153,50,Excellent Resort,"We just got back from the Montage at Kapalua Bay for our honeymoon and we were both blown away. The level of service and detail was unmatched, and everyone there made us feel at home. I travel all the time for work, and never have I stayed in or seen such a well kept property.    Kapalua is more low key than areas such as Lahaina or Wailea, but it's not a far drive if you're looking for the shopping and dining in Lahaina. Speaking of dining, don't miss out on eating at the Cane & Canoe - it's a bit pricey but definitely worth it for a special occasion. The beach activities are also wonderful at Kapalua; the snorkeling was great and there are plenty of turtles in both Kapalua Bay as well as the neighboring Napili Bay.    Overall, the resort was a huge highlight of our trip. The views were beautiful and the staff is great!",May 2015,May 2015,Traveled as a couple,,
272232327,50,NEW TOP DOG ON MAUI,"May I just say WOW! My husband and I, along with family and friends over the many years, have travelled at least once a year to Maui for over two decades - staying around three weeks on each visit. We have tried almost everything - loving to move around from Hana for a few nights, to other places from the high dollar hotel to the cozy beach house. We basically have always settled on The Four Seasons being pretty much the pinnacle of our Maui lodgings.    We were extremely hesitant to spend time in Kapalua on this visit to try the Montage due to very iffy weather in Kapalua even in the middle of summer, but the hotel looked so great on paper we had to give it a try for a few nights on this vacation. I am so very glad we did! What a winner!    We checked out of the Four Seasons (where we are always given wonderful upgrades and special amenities and perks due to our frequent stays there) and checked in as first time guests to the Montage. We were treated beautifully and escorted to a one bedroom ocean view residence that caused our jaws to drop. We just left a one bedroom ocean front suite at the Four Seasons that we were practically getting lost from each other in, and this room was at least double the size. In addition to having a full kitchen that rivals the one I have at home and a full laundry room- there is a lanai that is at least 1000 square feet overlooking the most gorgeous grounds, pool and sweeping ocean and Molokai views. The furnishings and decorative touches are beautiful and tasteful and extremely comfortable. Housekeeping is friendly and extremely competent. The grounds are like a botanical garden of color and lush beauty. I don't even have words to describe the gorgeous swimming pools on the property. No matter what time of day you go to the pool you will find private, beautiful and serene nooks and spaces to make your own with plenty of uncrowded ambiance. Most important - even though the hotel was at 100 percent capacity there were no crowds AT ALL. We felt we had the resort practically to ourselves.    We loved this hotel so much we tried to stay there for an additional five days and ""eat"" the two night deposit we had at the Four Seasons - where we were planning to return to our beautiful upgraded accommodations. We wanted to simply stay put in Kapalua at the Montage. I do believe we have finally found the perfect Maui paradise. I highly recommend this wonderful hotel and definitely will be returning for a much longer blissful stay.",May 2015,May 2015,Traveled as a couple,I can't imagine a bad room on the property - just choose according to your view preference.,"Nashville, Tennessee"

We rented a spectacular 4 bedroom private residence at the Montage Kapalua bay resort. 3,000 square feet of absolute luxury. Everything about this resort is six star. Yes it was expensive at $1,500 USD a night and meals were on top of that, but paradise doesn't come cheap. Four large bedrooms, 4.5 bathrooms right out of a magazine. Superb gourmet kitchen with a large three sectioned Lanai with outdoor furniture with full dining table and chairs and grill to BBQ. We cooked and ate all of our meals on the Lanai and enjoyed cocktails watching the Maui sunsets each night. A wonderful pool with rock waterfalls and little private coves. Great pool side bar with attentive staff and a beautiful safe beach for snorkelling just a minutes walk. Sun lounges and umbrellas would be set up for you by the beach crew.

269395582,50,Perfect way to end our stay in Maui,"I ended up booking the last 2 nights we had on Maui here. We stayed at the Westin Ocean Villas, don't get me started on how many bumps in the road I had with them, I'm so glad that I made the choice to switch. Everything about the hotel is great. From the whole booking process. I had called the hotel initially and went through the process and when they were taking my credit card asked me which type of Amex I had because there were added benefits the property offered. All I had to do was call Amex tell them I booked at the hotel so it can call and give me the benefits. Totally didn't have to but hey a free breakfast each morning, spa credit along with early and late checkout isn't so bad.    I called in the morning to double check if they would have our room ready, I was told if it wasn't they would take care of everything so we could start enjoying the hotel until it was. We got there at 11am the room was ready thru had my daughters crib all set up, provided baby gates (never had a hotel give me baby gates) and plug outlet covers. Truly thought of everything. They also had a nice welcoming gift for my daughter as well in the room on top of the stuffed animals of sea creatures they give to all the kids at check in.    We had an ocean view villa and it was a fantastic view. The rooms were massive and they have direct tv with a dvr, if that doesn't feel like home I don't know what doesn't. We ended up dining on our balcony for all our meals since it was nice to eat outside looking out at the ocean.    Another fantastic thing the hotel has that the concierge informed me about and help setup was a family photoshoot session with Pacific Dream Photography. They are on site and made the whole experience from start to finish easy. I would have never thought about pictures but I'm glad I did them because now o have some wonderful memories. I was able to view my pictures the following morning and order prints as well as got digital copies of everything all on a nice jump drive. I would highly recommend using them for photos, we did our session at sunset and it didn't take more than 30-45 minutes tops. Prices are reasonable, I can't wait to get my prints!    The overall feel of this hotel is this, if you want to truly get away from the busyness of resort row and disconnect and be pampered this is your hotel. Granted it's a little bit away from things but that is what I liked about this hotel. Their attention to detail and excellent customer service made our stay wonderful.

It's has spectacular views, wonderful rooms, beautiful pools, great walking paths and truly amazing staff. I can't say enough about the staff - everyone was extremely professional yet friendly and helpful. They went out of their way to assist you, and it was truly the best customer service experience ever!    The 1 bedroom unit we had was huge - full kitchen complete with SubZero refrigerator, oven, cooktop, 2-drawer dishwasher and fully equipped with everything you might need if you wanted to cook in. The dining room had a table for 6 and the living room was tastefully decorated and had a large flat screen TV. There was also a laundry closet with a full size washer and dryer - which was also appreciated (and detergent) and a half bath at the entrance. But the most amazing space has to be the huge lanai overlooking the pool and gardens and ocean. We lived out there when we were in the room - it was comfortably furnished with a round sofa, 4 lounge chairs and a round table & 4 chairs. It was so peaceful and relaxing. The separate bedroom was also tastefully furnished and the bed was extremely comfortable. There was a second TV too. The large bathroom had a separate tub and large glass doored shower. And I almost forgot the walk in closet and tons of dresser drawer space. They really thought of everything.    We enjoyed a nice but expensive breakfast most mornings in the Cane & Canoe Restaurant and also had dinner there twice. Again, excellent service and great food. We also enjoyed the ""in residence"" dining one evening when we returned late and exhausted from a tour of the Road to Hana. A big shout-out to Melissa who went way above and beyond - she was a delight! There are a number of very good restaurants in the area as well and the property has a shuttle that will drop you off and pick you up - which we really appreciated. There is also a bar and small restaurant by the pool area and we enjoyed some great cocktails and appetizers there as well.    And the pool, it was truly a work of art - little nooks and crannies, waterfalls, and even an adult only section with an infinity wall. It was lovely and relaxing, the lounge chairs were comfortable, and towels abundant.    The concierge was very helpful in booking a helicopter trip and making dinner reservations outside the hotel property. There is free wi-fi, and it's fast.    And I could go on and on.

Great layout and space for 6 of us, beautiful patio overlooking whales in the ocean,...we were here with people in their 70's, 40's, and teens and everyone loved it!    The service was good but not great - we walked into the restaurant which was 70% empty with about 20 open tables and were told there was a 45 minute wait. What??    That said, we would absolutely stay here again. The space was fabulous, the pools were gorgeous, and in general, it felt like the Hawaiian heaven you would hope for.    We took the wrong route getting to the hotel - going up the northeast side which I would not recommend. The highway is extremely narrow, unpaved in places, and has abundant switchbacks.

You will be dazzled by the beauty of the view from your lanai when you wake up in the morning. Palm trees, meandering paths, pools, the Pacific ocean, the islands of Lanai and Molokini on the horizon, the rocky promontory that juts out in to the ocean between the Kapalua Bay and the Nimalu bay.    Not overcrowded. You will feel like you own this place. Huge, spectacular two bedrooms, kitchen, 2.5 bath, great dining, famiky room, lanai, washer, dryer, free wifi.    Lounging on the lanai, reading, or just day-dreaming, napping--priceless.    Outstanding pools, poolside service, food.  4 holes mini-golf and other lawn games for kids and grown-up kids.    The snorkeling on the Kapalua Bay was better and so much easier than even on Molokini or the Olawalu reef. The Beach Club has a gorgeous infinity pool that was just to ourselves. Loved the rocky point , the beach, the walks. Magical sun drenched rain showers that last a minute or two.    If you can, go to the Merriman's restaurant for dinner. Great food, best Mai Tai, and gorgeous sunsets. Cane and Canoe restaurant on property was wonderful as well.    Car valet service is great, even at $20/day, plus tips. Overall great hospitality!!

263869302,50,The best part of our vacation in Maui was Montage Kapalua Bay,"Our family split time between Wailea and Kapalua on our Maui vacation so that we could more easily do and visit different things on the island. Staying at the Montage in Kapalua was a great experience and in retrospect I am glad we did it last. The resort's secret weapon is that it is much less crowded. In Wailea, you would see people staking out pool chairs at 6:30am and if you wanted to do something in the morning and only go swimming in the afternoon you might find it difficult to get a spot. Same goes for dinner reservations and other amenities. At the Montage, you feel like you have the run of the place. Sure there are other people there, but it was never crowded and you feel like you could get some peace to go with the beauty.    Other things we liked about the Montage are Cane and Canoe restaurant and bar (with a pool table), Hanu Hut Bar, the pools - the awesome main pool and even a smaller side pool that had its own bar and ping pong table, the beach that had great snorkeling right off shore, and the amazing staff - the concierge, wait staff, valet, grounds staff, and housekeeping really were friendly and always called me by name if I met them before.    One other great perk at the Montage is the availability of onsite portrait photography. The concierge arranges this through Pacific Dream Photography and a one hour session on the beautiful grounds of the area is complimentary. We were on Maui for a special occasion and wanted to capture the memory with professional pictures of our family. Rodrigo was our photographer and he was excellent. He guided us to a few areas and took different types of shots to provide a nice collection for us to choose from. We arranged to review the pictures two days later and was greeted by James, the Creative Director of the company. He created a relaxed no-pressure environment to showcase the photos and a simple process to review and choose the ones we liked. The results were so nice that we ended up choosing quite a few so went with a package, but there is no pressure to buy and you could walk out with just one or a handful if that's what you want.    We have stayed at the Montage resorts in Laguna Beach and Park City.

After restructuring post financial crisis, Montage operates this as a hotel with some of the units already sold as fractional and whole ownership units. The result is a magnificent resort with impeccable hardware that should command a much higher price than it is today. This means a good deal for all who come as guests. We stayed in a 3 bedroom with clear ocean view of Lanai and Molokai, fully equipped kitchen and access to the sprawling Montage Spa. Sunsets were gorgeous with no two days being the same. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Some visitors are bothered by the trade winds that always seem to be blowing through. But we weren't. It keeps the air fresh and that's how the houses back in the old days were built to have constant breeze come through the back of the house to the front.

After visiting last October, I knew I needed to bring my family along so they could understand what my husband and I were so excited about... let's just say we have 4 more people raving about his spot now :)    Things to know:  - the rooms/residences are amazing and the full kitchen is perfect for whipping up cocktails and appetizers to enjoy during sunset (also the stemware is amazing)  - the hotel's decor is the perfect blend of traditional Hawaiian with a contemporary/modern flair... super comfortable and inviting, and all of the details throughout the resort are beautiful (live orchids in your room, hibiscus flowers on hallway tables, infused water available throughout the resort, frozen banana slices drizzled with Nutella brought out as a complimentary poolside snack)  - the TVs in the residences have DVR capabilities, so you don't have to miss your favorite shows or the big game!  - they have a shuttle that can take you to neighboring hotels/restaurants (great to take to Sansei... the best sushi spot on the island, right up the road!)  - I hate to share this secret tid-bit, but the Beach Club pool is a great quiet hideaway and Laurie is one of the nicest people on the property (and makes a great cocktail!)  - Vanessa (the sommelier) at Cane and Canoe is super knowledgeable and very sweet  - the lanai is amazing... we did everything from laying out and reading on our chaise lounges, to enjoying our morning breakfast at the table and sipping champagne on their round sofa (my favorite spot!)  - hotel guests get access to the amazing fitness center and spa... be sure to take advantage of the sauna/steam rooms and bamboo showers... it's the perfect spot to spend rainy mornings  - the pool is gorgeous and probably one of the prettiest I have witnessed first hand at a resort, but my favorite part (aside from the perfect temperature, poolside service, hidden waterfalls and gorgeous layout)? You don't have to wake up at sunrise to score chairs... there is always great seating available!  - the best tip I can provide... order the Kalua Pork nachos.

262945491,50,Luxury in the Details,"After hearing so many good things about the Montage Kapalua Bay prior to visiting, it would have been easy to approach the property with a bit of skepticism; veering from the whole under promise/ over deliver mantra we are all too familiar with. The Montage exceeded expectations on all levels and left my whole family with our jaws on the floor. The property is divine and serene. Our residence was like nothing I've seen before, with every room outfitted with every need and amount of space (and then some!) for the 6 of us, the kitchen completely stocked with anything utensil you would need to make a complete homemade meal, or simply drinks and appetizers, which we had every night before going out. I can't DESCRIBE how nice it was to have the option to come home to your fridge stocked beforehand; an hour on the beach instead of shopping at Safeway for the week is priceless (and the on-property general store to re-up on your charcuterie or Rombauer was spot-on). The service hotel-wide was incredibly warm and polite, but also genuine (staff engaging in conversation beyond the usual ""hello's"" and ""how are you's"", or the somm at Cane and Canoe sending over a sour beer as she heard we were gose fans). The pools on site are exquisite, and you have not had nachos until you have tasted (in our case... inhaled) the Kalhua pork nachos with a Painkiller cocktail in the other hand poolside. The property includes incredible walking trails and a bay you can rock jump into if bravery strikes....a quick stroll away; a protected beach with soft sand and snorkeling. As a frequent gym-goer, the fitness and spa were state of the art, clean, and inviting. You can have so many different experiences without ever leaving the property. There are no lines, there is no waiting, there is plenty of space, and everything at the Montage Kapalua Bay feels like it is placed there just for you.

Rooms are great, many come with a kitchen, washer and dryer. The pool is as beautiful as any pool I have ever seen, and the beach is spectacular, with great snorkeling, long boarding and swimming. hotel faces west so the sunsets are georgeous. Only minor complaint is they charge $300 per day for a poolside lanai, and most were unoccupied (sunrise?). On site restaurant, Cane and Canoe, was also top notch.",Mar 2015,March 2015,Traveled with family,,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States"
261851179,50,Now THIS is LUXURY!!,"I cannot speak highly enough of the Montage Kapalua Bay. My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights at the beginning of our Hawaii honeymoon. We were upgraded to a bedroom suite and it was HUGE! The kithchen was deluxe (wine fridge, cooktop, fridge, kitchenaid appliances, bar mixers and glasses etc) everything you could possibly need and more. Shame we didnt need to use any of it. Our room had two king size bedrooms each with their own very large ensuite with baths. Beautiful veranda area overlooking the most beautifully landscaped gardens, pool and ocean. Wow. Just wow.    The staff were very lovely and knew us by name. The food at the Cane and Canoe restaurant was delightful; very fresh and tasty made from great produce. I do note that we only ate breakfast here, but I have no doubt dinner would have been amazing. The setting was to die for - I am missing it so much just thinking about it.    We were there during whale migration season and were able to see them from the pool area. Such a fantastic site.    The pool is the best I've seen at a hotel. Hidden waterfalls, quaint bridges, nothing has been spared in creating a luxury retreat and playground.    The location is amazing if you are looking for some peaceful R&R. There is great snorkeling nearby, or so we were told - the weather was not kind to us while we were there so did not experience the snorkeling first hand. We want to go back in the summer time just for the beaches and snorkeling.    There are some restaurants in the area that are within walking distance if you dont want to pay the extra money to eat at the resort. There are also lovely walking tracks - definitely recommend the walking track that takes you around the coast up to the Carlton Ritz. We did that on our way to dinner and werent exactly dressed for the occasion. I managed ok in flat sandals, but would recommend sneakers or sport shoes. We did it at dusk and saw a double rainbow, kite surfers and whales. It was just magic.    You definitely need a car to get around Maui. It is an easy drive into the main area of Lahaina and there is plenty of parking there.    We were able to park our car at the resort and be warned, while tripadvisor says parking is complimentary, it is not. We had to pay $30 a night which we were told at checkout. That was my one complaint given it was not made clear previously, and we were already paying a resort fee for each day of stay, so I would have thought that that would also cover valet. A minor complaint given how amazing everything else was.    I honestly cant recommend this hotel enough. Do yourself a favour and stay at the Montage Kapalua Bay. It is relaxing, spacious and just deluxe.",Mar 2015,March 2015,Traveled as a couple,i honestly don't think you could get a bad room at the Montage.,"Perth, Australia"

260242725,50,Most Relaxing Vacation Ever,"The whole family (9 all together) moved into a 4 bedroom resident for 5 days. Best family vacation ever. Everyone had their own room and bathroom which was a bonus--all together but just enough privacy to keep everyone happy. Bedrooms have huge tv's (80 inch I think). Breakfast on the front deck afforded ocean and whale watching opportunities. We saw hundreds of whales breaching and blowing in the ocean from our deck and the amazing walking path. This path twists through sandy beaches, black volcanic rocky outcroppings and heavy green foliage. White sand beaches and coolest pools ever! The staff was friendly, efficient, helpful and accommodating-- best I have ever experienced. They anticipate every want, need and desire. Fell in love with Brian and Andrew--favorites!

255472331,50,WOW! There can't be a better resort...,"We had the most unbelievable experience at the Montage. We stayed early February and I am not even sure I can sum up how wonderful this property is... but I will try!    Check-in  -It is a bit of a drive from the main airport in Maui and there is a lot of traffic. Once you are the west side of Maui, though, no need to go anywhere else.  -The valet met us and quickly unloaded the many bags we traveled with.  -We were greeted with leis and a toy for our eight-month old.    Room  -The room was amazing. We were coming off four days at the Grand Hyatt in Kauai and this room felt like a castle in comparison.  -The kitchen was large and stocked with everything you could need.  -The lanai, where we spent most of our time, was HUGE! It had a table and four chairs, two sitting tables, and one large round sofa to sit back and relax in.  -My only complaint about the room was that I didn't love the shower head (not enough pressure for me) but this is a very small complaint.    Pool  -The pool, as many have mentioned, is a highlight of this property. They were at full capacity when we were there and yet we were always able to get two chairs under an umbrella.  -The pool temperature was perfect. At the Hyatt it was too cold for us to go in. Here, we went in the pool every day and our 8 month old loved it!  -We often felt like the only people in the pool, even with our son's very large pool float that we pushed him around in.    Staff  The staff is by far and away the highlight of the Montage  -Jeremia was helpful in arranging what we needed before we even arrived. He sent over a list of local grocery stores, made luau reservations, and answered any questions I had prior to arrival. Towards the end of the stay we realized we needed a late check-out and he went out of his way to ensure that it could be accommodated. He was exceptional in ever way!  -Housekeeping. While we never met them (isn't that the way housekeeping should be?), the housekeeping staff at the Montage exceeded every expectation. Two examples:  One, they realized the small travel bottle drying rack wasn't cutting it for all the bottles and various parts associated with feeding a baby and they brought up a new bottle rack. Yes, on hand they had a HUGE bottle rack that they allowed me to keep for the week.  Two, unfortunately our son got very sick with bronchitis on this trip. We needed a humidifier for him and when the one that they gave us was not working, they went to another property to get a working humidifier from them.    We went to Cane and Canoe for breakfast one morning, the food was incredible and the service by Matt was great.    We also visited the spa while we had a babysitter for the little guy and the facilities were top of the line: private pool, steam room, jacuzzis, sauna, etc.    Running from the hotel is a little difficult in that there are a ton of hills on this side of the island but, hey, they hills help you burn some of those extra calories.    There is really neat path that is by the hotel where you can walk along the ocean and see whales.    If you're looking for a hotel that has a big nightlife or lots of activities, this is not for you. But if you're looking to relax with unsurpassed service, you've found your spot. All in all, this was the best hotel experience of my life. I will be daydreaming about when I can go back!",Feb 2015,February 2015,Traveled with family,,"Denver, Colorado"

We'd had a great time there (in our life before children.) We chose the Montage this time--based on a fantastic stay at the Deer Valley property. We didn't think anything could exceed our time in Utah, but we were wrong. Our trip to Kapalua exceeded our expectations in every imaginable category. The staff was simply incomparable to any we've met before. The concierge staff, led by Ted, was tireless and creative in helping us fill the days with different activities, while never overloading us or overselling any one choice. The children enjoyed a night out at Paintbox, with Miss Sherri, who took them on a hike beneath the stars, to explore with handmade constellation guide. Ahlea, who helped us with our reservation, was another standout. After booking, and before our arrival, she stayed in touch to make sure we didn't want to switch rooms (to a less expensive one, by the way.) Also--we had a great time with Pacific Dream Photography (Rodrigo was behind the lens, outstanding with our kids!)) The staff arranged a photo shoot, to help us capture the beauty of the place and this moment in time for our family. A great set of photos to carry with us, from an awesome week that we'll never forget. As a traveler who spends more than 120 nights a year on the road, in accommodations from modest to plush, time with the family is precious. This was the single best stay--and the best hotel--I've ever visited. Only tough moment was leaving. Mahalo to the Montage!

253423859,50,Wonderful family vacation,"We had an amazing stay at the Montage Kapalua. My husband, our 22-month daughter, and I (6 months pregnant) stayed in one of the oceanview premier rooms, which was perfect in every way. The kitchen was gorgeous (and even gave us some ideas for our upcoming kitchen remodel!), and all the amenities were wonderful. We had a private little grassy yard, which was great for sunbathing and for letting our toddler run around when she wasn't in the pool.    The pool was definitely the highlight of our daughter's trip. Every morning she wanted to go to the ""bubble pool"" which is a little area of the pool that has jets pointed up to create a bubble effect. The pool never felt crowded and there were many nooks to set up so you felt like you had the resort all to yourselves. The pool staff was wonderful as well and made sure we were set up with towels and waters at all times.    The close second to the pool was koi feeding. At 9:30, children go to the koi fish pond to collect fish food. ""Fish num nums!"" Cade was so great with everyone!    The beach is small but beautiful and great for snorkeling or whale watching. It is very protected so there is no worry of waves knocking you or your little ones down. If you want surfing though, you'll have to head elsewhere.    We luckily have a great souvenir from our trip - a package of photos from Pacific Dream Photography. James captured beautiful moments in our complimentary photo session, and he spent time with us to choose which photos we liked best. The perfect memento!

253384628,50,Great service with amazing views!,"My husband and I just returned from our long awaited 30th anniversary trip to The Montage Kapalua Bay. We have been to Hawaii many times and this was one of the best hotel experiences we have had in the islands. The staff was warm and welcoming throughout the resort. We loved our room which felt like home instead of being in a hotel room. We enjoyed being able to cook when we felt like it or in minutes been down at Cane and Canoe in the bar for a light dinner or in the restaurant to enjoy dining outside, something we do not get enough of where we live. We were aware that the hotel was quite full the entire time we were there, however, the resort never seemed too crowded. I think having such spacious hotel accommodations with lovely patios guests did not feel they had to be out of the room the entire day.    The main pool has something for everyone. You could escape to one of the many quiet areas or if you have small children there is a wonderful place for them to swim and not interact with those that want a little more privacy. There is no need to wait in line as you do at other resorts in the morning to find that perfect spot. In my mind that is not a vacation! On day 2 we found the Beach Club Pool. That became one of our favorite spots. Wonderful views, quiet.. and its own bar with lunch and snacks as well. If the pool is your thing, there is also a very tranquil pool at the spa.    Speaking of the spa, be sure to save time for any of their classes. We were able to attend 7 different classes and they were all terrific. The instructors really took the time to make sure everyone was comfortable in their ability and offered help when needed. These are not your typical woosie resort classes, they gave you quite a workout. After all that work, a little pampering was in order and they did not disappoint there either. You get a real sense of place in the Spa (and throughout the resort) and the view from the fitness studio was not to be believed.    I recommend this resort to couples and families as well. My dream would be to go back with our entire extended family for a reunion. Each family could have their own space to get away to have some time alone and yet plenty of time and places to be together.    Mahalo to all at The Montage, keep up the good service and we will be back soon to take in the views and do some more whale watching from our patio.

The multi-level pool is decadent. There is a wonderful restaurant, a convenience store, and multiple bars on property. Montage also distinguishes itself from all other properties with it's commitment to the Hawaiian culture. Many activities during your stay will immerse you into the Hawaiian ways and make you appreciate the uniqueness of the islands. The best part of the property though is the service. Everyone makes you part of their family. Janet and Aomi will welcome you and make all your arrangements on the island (including personal shopping). Brian will take you on incredible hikes in the area. Sila is an incredible cultural resource who guides everyone in the Hawaiian ways. Lubi will make sure you are comfortable and well hydrated by the pool. Peter and Tui are your go-to guys for any other needs at the pool. But the #1 ambassador on the property has to be Kiha. He is the anchor of the poolside bar. Make sure you look him up.

250751573,50,Must be one if the best beach resorts in the world,"We were not familiar with the Montage brand so we did not know what to expect. This place exceeded our high expectations. You have all the comforts of home and all the convenience of an ultra luxury hotel. The service is pretty much on par with four seasons. Although they don't nickel and dime you the room prices are high. However you basically get a whole condo for your room. It's fully furnished and even includes dishes and a coffee maker. We saved a lot by preparing our own small meals. However room service was excellent both in terms of service and food quality. They are also extremely fast in terms of food delivery.    I wanted to thank Byron from bell services. He was the single most outstanding host during our stay. Honorable mentions to Scott, Justice, Wayne (poolside), and Jessica. In fact each montage employee was pretty great. We traveled with a 2 year old and twin infants. People were really helpful.    The overall grounds location and pool are absolutely top notch. Although the rooms are a hefty price you get a lot for your $. We got a great deal through an orbitz hotel & car package which increased our sense of good value.    Forgive my rambling. My advice is to try this resort before word gets out and they raise prices. It's really fantastic. It is now my 1st choice on Maui after at least half a dozen visits. Thanks Montage. Sorry I could not mention each host, house keeper, and server by name. I hope to return next winter.    Hints: you can use the Napilli markets nearby if you need groceries.

250542270,50,Surprisingly pleased!,"My husband and I stayed four nights at the Montage after being at the Four Seasons on Lanai for three nights and I have to say we liked the Montage better!    We were warmly greeted by the staff and shown to our ground floor garden view suite in building 4, very close to the restaurant. We really prefer ground floor rooms and the view was lovely… unobstructed, views of the pool, palm trees and a peek of ocean in the distance. The patio was HUGE and perfect for enjoying the beautiful sunset each evening. My husband and I both thought the view and set-up of the property was reminiscent of the Four Seasons Maui, maybe even a little nicer because it is a bit more open.    Room was clean, modern and spacious. Kitchen facilities were impressive and allowed us plenty of space to stock up on breakfast items, snacks, cocktails supplies, etc. Bathroom was huge (there was an additional 1/2 bath by the laundry unit near the front door as well) and bedroom was simple, comfortable and had its own access to the patio. Room service one night for a movie night in was a nice option. Housekeeping was prompt and did a great, unobtrusive job.    The weather is Kapalua was perfect -- sunny, 81 degrees each day, not a drop of rain and no wind. We were concerned because we had heard about the unreliable weather up in that area, but it was not a problem at all while we visited (mid-January).    What we really loved most about this property was it was first-class with options… it could be as full-service as you wanted it to be or you could be totally independent and that flexibility appealed to us.    The pool was stunning -- like no other I have seen at a Hawaiian property. Four or more levels, little hidden areas everywhere, hot tubs here and there and many different options for setting up ""camp"" for the day. The uppermost deck was adult only and most of the kids seemed to be in the lower area out near the ocean. In addition to this main pool, there is a small quiet pool at the beautiful full-service spa on property and a pretty infinity edge pool at members' beach club at the edge of the property that has a great view of Kapalua Bay, both of which are available to Montage guests at all times. Pool service at all the pools was fantastic, but in particular we'd like to acknowledge Beth at the main pool -- she was just awesome!    Beaches nearby are beautiful, and hotel guests get complimentary set up at Kapalua Bay Beach… short, easy walk to the left of the property. This beach seems to be the preferred beach for snorkeling and Napili Bay beach (just a little further south around the bend) seems to be the better beach for swimming. Both were quite crowded.    My husband enjoyed playing golf at the Bay Course which is a just across the street from the entrance to the Montage. We also did several of the hiking trails in the Kapalua area -- great ocean scenery and the Village Trails around the old golf course are a really good workout!    Our only complaint is the food… it simply wasn't great and left us wanting more, especially in the dinner options department. Kapalua is pretty sleepy and there aren't a ton of dining options in the area that appealed to us. Nearby Merriman's was a disappointment and Cane and Canoe (on property) was beautiful, but the food was just lacking, especially for the price. We weren't really all that interested in anything the Ritz Carlton had to offer. Finally, on our last night, we did enjoy a sushi meal at Sansei up in the Kapalua Village. Good sushi and fun atmosphere… definitely the ""hot spot"" of the neighborhood.    We would definitely return to the Montage and are even considering bringing our teenage kids with us on a visit in the near future because we liked it that much… This is a major step, as Hawaii is usually a kids-free zone for us!",Jan 2015,January 2015,Traveled as a couple,,"Sacramento, California"

250200849,40,I Want To Live Here!,"""I want to live here."" Those were the first words out of my mouth when we were taken to our room at the Montage, formerly the Ritz Carlton Residences. The Montage had only recently took over, so the Ritz-Carlton logo and ""lion"" we're still on the doors and other areas. No matter. We had a three bedroom ocean view room. We were traveling with our 2 older teens and they were beyond thrilled to have their own rooms. The residence was spacious- three nice sized bedrooms, two facing the ocean, each with their own bathrooms. The master bath was enormous, complete with a huge tub and large shower. Each room had a walk-in closet, and 2 rooms had King beds and one had 2 doubles Each room also had a flat screen TV. The room decor was dated and the furniture looked worn, but clean. The kitchen was small but terrific-- Sub-Zero fridge and top,of the line appliances, fully stocked with all the cooking utensils you need. The oliving room faced the ocean and had a large flat screen TV and stereo, along with dated, but comfortable sofas. The location is enviable and perfect-- on our favorite piece of land in Maui, Kapalua Bay. We have been to Maui too many times to count, and have stayed in Wailea at the Four Seasons and the Kea Lani, and in Kapalua at the Ritz-Carlton and at the former Kapalua Bay Hotel where the Montage currently is. Kapalua is our favorite spot on the island-- the bay is lovely and teeming with fish; the location is gorgeous and serene; and it is less crowded than the other resort areas of Wailea and Kaanapali. So, with all this beauty and perfection, why did I only give it four stars? Well, we were there during a transition, and the transition was not fluid. We probably had the most uncomfortable bed I have ever slept on. After a couple of nights of not sleeping, I complained and the staff brought a board to be placed under the lumpy mattress. It did not help. Finally, two nights before we left ( we were there 9 nights) they brought me a different mattress. Why didn't they do that to begin with? The staff was spotty--some were excellent and incredibly helpful, while others didn't seem to know anything about service. We had a breakfast plan, and we were charged for breakfast every morning and told it would come off our bill; it did not, and it took me three months and several emails to finally get it settled. The spa, although lovely, was understaffed. There is an amazing outdoor relaxation area in the women's lounge that had a cooling waterfall next to the jacuzzi. However the jacuzzi looked a little dirty, so as appealing as it looked from a distance, up close we didn't want to indulge. The fitness classes were good, but again pricing was off. Since I attended classes every day, the spa coordinator suggested I purchase a class pass; however as a hotel guest, my per class rate was less if I just bought my classes as I went instead of buying a pass. It didn't make sense to offer me a pass that would end up costing me more (Besides, classes should be complementary to guests at the rates they are charging!). The restaurants were good and the service overall was excellent. I love the location, and with some upgrades to service, and to room decor, the Montage will be the top rated resort in Maui.",Jan 2015,July 2014,Traveled with family,,"Pacific Grove, California"
249764430,40,ALoha!!!,"We spent our first night in Maui at the Ritz Carlton at Kapalua Bay but after walking to the Montage one afternoon we decided to move. We are so happy we did. This hotel is newer and cleaner. It is my understanding that this once belonged to the Ritz but was sold to the Montage and they reopened Spring of 2014. Each room is a residence with a kitchen, bedroom, living area, washer/dryer. It is very spacious. You can choose Two and Three bedroom options but we stayed in only a 1 bedroom residence. Each residence has a true ocean view with a very spacious balcony with several lounge chairs and sofas. We spent the majority of our time at the pool. The service could be a little more attentive. Our first afternoon at the pool, we rented beds ($300) that were a little hidden and harder to get to, making it harder for the pool attendant. The rest of the week, we choose to sit at a pool closer to the bar making it easier to receive food and drinks. I did not sit at the beach but I will say it is open to public and is not just for Montage guest. Apparently there are no beaches exclusively for the hotels. For breakfast we ate at Cane & Canoe located on the property. Very good but again service is a little slow. The guys at the bar next to Cane & Canoe (not sure if it has a name) were great. I remember Mitch and Chris' names and they were extremely nice and made our experience great!!  I would definitely return to this hotel if you are in this area of Maui.

248689979,30,Service was not up to par,"I have been to Maui 4 times in the past and have stayed at The Ritz-Carlton and The Four Seasons both of which I enjoyed immensely. I wanted to try something new and read all the wonderful reviews on Tripadvisor. The pictures looked gorgeous and I felt like the apartment style accommodations would suit my family. I only really needed a 2 bedroom but the woman taking the reservations said they were sold out of all other options so I paid top dollar for a three bedroom ocean front prime suite. I only say this because I feel like I got the bait and switch and was not happy about it.    I called from the airport to see if my room would be ready because I was going to stop at the market on the way and I needed to know if they would store my food. They told me my room was indeed ready and I was so excited. We were quite early so I decided to stop on the way to the hotel and buy some groceries. When I arrived at the hotel, all of a sudden the room was not available so they took my groceries and laid my luggage on the floor in the front driveway and told me to get our bathing suits and whatever else we needed to wait for the room by the pool. When I inquired about what happened to my room, I got the uncomfortable run around from a variety of front desk personnel. I arrived at the hotel around 1pm and the check in was not until 4. The concierge who was showing us around told us he didn't know what happened to my room but the ocean front prime rooms were in a certain section and on the two top floors of the hotel. My family changed in the bathroom and sat at the pool and had a snack and waited and waited and waited. At 4:05pm the phone rang. Seriously it took three hours for them to get a room ready? When I questioned the wait, I got a snide, it takes a long time to clean our units, they are really big. It was not a smart comment to make and if it takes that long to clean a unit, maybe they need to hire more people. Waiting three hours for a room when I was told it was ready was ridiculous and making us rummage through our luggage while kneeling in the car entrance is nothing I have ever experienced from any hotel. We were finally shown to our room which was neither on the top two floors or in the section the concierge pointed out to us which made me feel like they gave my room to someone else and charged me for a room I did not get. When I questioned this, I got a lame dismissal from the woman who showed us to our room.    By the time I got to the room, I was definitely annoyed. It was really hot and the air didn't work well. I mentioned it was too hot to the Bellman who told me that the air conditioning never went below a certain number and I said ""how can that be, its so hot."" I called down and they had someone come up and I told him what the Bellman had said. The Maintenance Man didn't know why the Bellman would say something like that. The nice guy fixed the air it and it worked fine after that.    The room was beautiful and the view was gorgeous but since I was on a bend, I didn't get the prime view I thought I paid for. I was blocked on the left by a building so could not see all I had expected.    The first day, I went down to the pool and left my son sleeping in the room with the ""do not disturb"" sign on. Well, they did disturb and barged into the room and woke my son up bright and early. I called down and asked them to not come early the next day. Well guess what, they didn't come at all! So, I had to call down again to ask for clean towels, coffee, toilet paper, etc. Not 5 star service AT ALL.    It seemed like there were not enough people working at the pool. One day the pool service was good and the next, you couldn't even get anyone to acknowledge you for a drink. It was very, very hot and it was necessary to drink lots of water. Having to get up every 20 minutes to ask for water is not what you expect from a 5 star property. One server even chided me because no one was paying attention to me so I interrupted her complaining to a fellow worker and she told me I would have to wait because she just got back from a management meeting and needed to get herself together. REALLY?????    There were a series of other issues which were just unbelievable to me. We ordered breakfast at Cane and Canoe and sat there for over an hour with no food whatsoever. The waiter totally forgot to put our order in and never came to check on us. The restaurant was not crowded at all. I finally got up to ask where the food was and he realized he screwed up. He brought us a fruit plate ""on the house"" then proceeded to bring us another fruit plate which we ordered over an hour before for breakfast. I commented that we didn't need two fruit plates so he took one back and charged us for it. I asked to see the manager and it became an embarrassing situation. The whole thing was so ridiculous and the Chef came out to see what the problem was. He thought I was complaining about the food. After the fruit plate, we never even got the breakfast. He made me feel so uncomfortable that we didn't want to go back and ordered room service for the next few mornings because it became such a big deal.    There were just a ton of things that really made me regret booking this hotel. I did have the chance to speak with a manager and he did listen respectfully and tried to appease me in the end. The hotel was a little boring and I felt that you could have been anywhere in the world. It lacked the Hawaiian feel and needed maybe some more entertainment or things to do.    I also didn't love that the beach was not right in front of hotel. It is not far but has no bathroom facilities nearby. It is a thin stretch of beach that did have loungers but it was also public so it wasn't as peaceful as other hotels.    It just didn't feel like a vacation to me, staying at the Montage made me feel like I was visiting a friend and was on my own. I am all about service and I just felt it was sorely lacking. Lots of young people with no direction. No one knew what was going on. I wouldn't go back.",Jan 2015,August 2014,Traveled with family,,"New York City, New York"
248480071,50,I wish I could give 6 stars...,"I just had the privilege of staying at this fantastic property. This is bar none the best hotel in the entire state of Hawaii, and one of the best hotels that I stayed at. I had a deluxe two bedroom oceanview suite. The view from almost every room in this property is fantastic. There are only 60 plus rooms so you hardly notice anyone is there. It had the most amazing balcony that I ever encountered, over 200 square feet of space with tables, reclining chairs, seating for 10 people. I am not the type to linger in a hotel: I'm usually up and gone to see the sights. This time I just wanted to stay in as much as possible and soak up the great ambience of Kapalua bay. From the moment of check-in where the staff seat you in the lounge, serving you with cucumber water and cold towels and get everything ready for you, to the valet service, and room service, the young and pleasant staff do an excellent job of pampering you without overbearing.    I had hesitated to book this hotel due to their prepayment policy: you have to pay for 2 nights at the time of reservation and you'll lose it within 60 days of cancellation. The other hotels in the area such as Ritz or Four Seasons had the same deposit policy but their cancellation period was much more lenient. I suspect that that is why this hotel's occupancy rate is a little lower. Management might want to take a look at this policy again. However, I am glad that I took the plunge and reserved this hotel.

They even had a wine cooler for our wine! The pool was fabulous and the restaurant was fantastic and with a view. The staff was wonderful without being overbearing. I just cant say enough about the Montage property. Belonging to the Timbers has allowed me to see nice properties but i think this is the nicest place i have stayed with all amenities you could want.

245631139,50,Paradise Found,"After checking into my original hotel I had booked in Kaanapali and being very disappointed by the entire experience (that should be my next review I guess) I knew that I needed to leave the hotel and find a new one for my daughters and I. My youngest daughter went on Trip Advisor and the first one to pull up was the Montage where she immediately said, Mommy, we need to stay here. After making a phone call to the hotel as it was after 5 o'clock and told them my story and how dissatified I was with my current hotel, they asked for my number and within 15 minutes the night manager of the hotel called me and said she would welcome me and my girls and promised an amazing experience. Not only did she deliver, This is my ultimate favorite hotel (and I travel a lot) From the moment our cab pulled up they knew my name and where ever I went in the resort, I was called by name (certainly make a guest feel very much at home) The room was an amazing 3 BR suite overlooking the ocean. They greaeed us with a gift for my daughter and flowers for my other daughter who was celebrating her birthday. The pool and grounds were immaculate and it was very quiet, there are little coves at the pool where you honestly think you have the place to yourselves. The dining was superb and everyone from the room attendants to the bartenders (a shout out to the guy who made us special drinks and got to smell the fruits of the islands) I for one would never stay anywhere else in the future and plan on returning next year with the rest of my family. I don't believe there is a bad room in the place, yes it is pricey, but it was worth everything they promised and more. They even had kids activities that were above and beyond. nearby their were awesome restautants, and I even ended up going Zip-Lining right near the hotel and had the experience of my life with my two daughters. I can't begin to tell you that you will not be disappointed with this hotel, Now I just need them to build more hotels near the caribbean where I live (Florida) and I can frequent them more often.",Dec 2014,October 2014,Traveled with family,"Anyroom with a view of the ocean, and the higher floors will give you an amazing overview of the...","Dorp Sint Michiel, Curaçao"

The weather in Kapalua is fairly awful. When you drive down the highway for just 10 minutes to Kaanapali or 20 minutes to Lahaina, the weather is dramatically better than at this hotel (still vs. very windy, low-80s vs. low-70s, sunny vs. rain/dark overcast). Not their fault, just a reality.    Half the units in this hotel are still owned, meaning that even during Thanksgiving week, the place was extremely sparsely populated, very quiet, and dull. The restaurant (Cane & Canoe) had 3-4 tables with people at it at prime time and you could hear the wood on the tables creak, it was so quiet. The pool, which usually had no one in it, was cold (probably because of the chilly weather here).    Also, I was shocked with the general look and feel of this place. I absolutely LOVE the Montage at Laguna and thought this would be pristine. It's not, the staff told me they only replaced the linens when they took over management of this location. Much of the wood's in need of sanding and staining and the walls need painting, carpets desperately in need of replacement. Not horrible, just the look and feel of a tired hotel and not what you'd expect from Montage.    Bottom line, I wouldn't stay here if I were you--unless you love super quiet places, don't like good weather, and don't care too much about the rooms/facilities.",Nov 2014,November 2014,Traveled with family,,"Danville, California"

Although we didn't have our wine on our balcony as much as we thought we would because we met Kiha, a bartender at the Sunset Bar. We enjoyed his company so much that we went back everyday.

The service at the pool was ok, not great and the pool food selection wasn't what you would expect of a high end hotel that caters to families with children. We ate at the main restaurant one night, service was good but the food selection was average at best. I believe the restaurant options need to be improved.    All in all a good hotel and location.

Our suite was one of the smallest...2 bedrooms, a full kitchen, 2 1/2 baths, living room equipped with a big screen TV, direct tv service with all the premium channels and, best of all, NFL Sunday ticket, so you can watch your favorite team play at 8am! The grounds are immaculate, the pool, with all it's waterfalls and different levels, incredible. There are 2 bars around the pool for drinks and food. The beach and views of the ocean are what you dream about.  As with all resorts, it really comes down to the people. Here, they are as happy, friendly, helpful, and accommodating as anywhere you'll experience. They make the difference. They are the true stars of the show.  The location is perfect. Secluded and tranquil, but only 10 minutes to the much crazier Kaanapali and 20 minutes to Lahiana town.  I could go on and on. The restaurant, Cane and Canoe is a treat. The associated bar has a reverse happy hour beginning at 8pm. To be fair, there were a few hiccups...they ran out of towns once. The waterfalls in the pool were being repaired for a few hours one day. I only mention these because I wanted to show some sense of objectivity in this review.

Most rooms 3rd floor and above appear to have great views, we were on 7th floor which I would highly recommend. All rooms are condo style well equipped should you want to cook yourself. Having a washer and dryer is a plus.    The pools are vast and beautiful, there are many quiet areas to discover. Because there are a limited number of rooms you don't get the overwhelmed pool population that most other resorts have.

The kids club, paintbox, has a well trained staff that not only keep the children entertained for a parents night out but also provide education about the environment. Ukulele, hula and lei making lessons are done by a wonderful lady lovingly referred to as Auntie Sila.

Everyone there seemed genuinely happy to be working there and helping the guests out - from the two staff members who greeted us and oriented us in our room to the staff throughout the visit. If we had any questions or needed anything, all we had to do was ask.  Lots of little extras - upon our arrival we were greeted with leis, fresh pineapple, and the stuffed animal of our children's choosing (too cute). Our room had a special poster with our kids' names painted on it to welcome them specifically. There were just lots of little things here and there that made us welcome. We even borrowed boogie boards.  The tidal pool tour was lovely - just the right balance of information and freedom to explore.  Kid's night out was one of the best we have experienced - they didn't just put the kids in front of team, but instead took them stargazing; they made constellation kaleidoscopes; found and learned about creatures around the property, and explored new games. They didn't want to leave when it was time to pick them up.    In need of improvement:    Communication seems to be an issue here - we asked multiple times for turn down before a certain time so they would not wake our children, and it only happened once. They had a lovely newsletter of upcoming events and some news from the times, but we only received it twice in the seven days. They sell kabobs and other meats ready for grilling on their grills but the grills aren't set up.  Housekeeping was inconsistent.  Their was an on again/off again cigarette smoke smell in our room. When we inquired, it was recommended we just leave the fans on constantly in our bathrooms.  Management seemed to be more important than the guests. We heard from several staff members over the course of the day that they would be unavailable if we needed anything else because they needed to serve the manager or take care of something for the manager.

They have signs posted at each of the hot tube (3) that say children have to be 10 years or more. We saw at least three mothers taking their diaper-clad babies into these hot tubs, while the serving staff nonchalantly walk by and ask if they'd like a drink. We even had the unfortunate experience of overhearing one child telling his mother ""I think I pooped!"", so his mother promptly changed his diaper right at the side of the hot tub! It would seem the staff are more interested in their next tip than bothering to enforce their rules.    Noise can also be a problem at times, depending on who is in the bar, as well as kids screaming at 7 in the morning.    As for the restaurant, the Cane and Canoe, the food was overpriced for what we got (eg. $44 for four smallish scallops????).

When you go, do not stop at the 7 sacred pools like most people do. Continue your trip past the pools. The road is hard dirt for about 5 miles, then opens up to the most gorgeous drive you will ever take in your life. That part of the drive is even nicer then the road to Hana.

Both my husband and I were awaken from a deep sleep with a women's screams, which sounded like she was being skinned alive...  Turns out she and her companion were just drunk and inconsiderate...  We saw workers out on the property cleaning the poor, going work but nothing was done to address it. We tried to go back to sleep after closing all of the sliding doors to our lanai, but can still hear her screams. After about 45mins of listening to her nonstop screams, I finally called front desk.  They did address it right away, however I was not able to go back to my peaceful sleep, and my hubby didn't get back to sleep at all, and was quite unhappy about it.    With the 2 incidences above, it feels more like a stay at a cheap mexican resort during spring break rather then a peaceful retreat at a high end property ...    I wish the night shift staff would do a better job of enforcing the rules of the resort, so that EVERYONE can have a great stay.",Nov 2014,November 2014,Traveled as a couple,,"Newport Beach, California"

The staff was friendly and accommodating. We had breakfast and lunch at one of the restaurants a couple of times, and an incredible special dinner prepared for us by Chef Rico.

235250389,50,My favorite hotel to date.,"I spent considerable time doing my research for my hotel choice in Maui and originally had planned to stay at the Ritz Carlton, I'll simply say that I'm extremely glad I didn't. This hotel was nothing short of spectacular from the service to the food to the amenities, I cannot fault the Montage for anything. There are 7 pools, none of which are very crowded and any point (on one day we were the only people by the pools for 3+ hours).    We stayed in a 3 bedroom suite that was excellent by all standards. The main living area was quite large with very high ceiling and fully serviced kitchen (full sets of dishes/silverware/cooking tools), complimentary coffee/water/juice. The beds were the most comfortable hotels beds I've slept in to date, the bathrooms very large (two master baths).    I would highly recommend the restaurant/bars there, in fact I wasn't too impressed with anything within a mile or so vicinity (we tried Iron Emu, Plantation House, Sea House, Sansei). The Cane & Canoe was by far our favorite restaurant and I'm not quite sure how it's not the top restaurant in Maui aside from price.    Overall I can't say enough about this place.",Oct 2014,October 2014,Traveled as a couple,,"Salt Lake City, Utah, United States"
234935145,50,Great Morning Coffee,First of all to address the one terrible review . . . Really!!! Everyone knows that resort pools are for the registered guest. Hard to believe people actually have the nerve to try and use a pool where they aren't paying to stay there. Every resort checks theses things for the comfort of their own guests.  We found the Market this morning and had a lovely time exploring this beautiful resort. The coffee was great as was the StickBun. The Coffee lady was super nice.

There were no noticeable kinks in our stay as mentioned in previous reviews.  Our concierge was extremely helpful and easy to contact, our room was enormous, everything was immaculate and the prices were good value for having such a beautiful property and seeing what those without such a property would charge.  I would say the pool staff was a little slow hopping around to get drinks and whatnot but the pace of life is just a little slower there, so maybe that was it. It didn't bother me too much as I was laying on one of the most comfortable beach chairs ever invented, perfectly shaded from the sun.  We spent most of our time at the pool and with all of the little lagoons and levels, it could be packed and you feel like you're the only one in it. I have not seen a better resort pool, it's incredible.  I had previously stayed at the Ritz (same area) about 8 years ago and there truly is no comparison.

They made great cocktails, even beyond those listed on the menu. There was nothing about our stay that did not exceed our very high expectations. We hope to return to the property next year to see the whales. The staff were the best part of our experience. James with Pacific Dream Photography, made us our favorite souvenir.

231406791,50,A Hidden Gem!!!!,"My husband, 1 1/2 year old son and I travel a lot. We usually go through VRBO.com and rent high-end estates. This trip to Maui we did rent a beach front estate for 7 days. The last day of being in Maui we decided to eat lunch at the Montage. Oh my oh my....a hidden gem!!!! Food was great, hotel was amazing and the views from there are just breath taking, staff was above and beyond, the pool is like a river pool and was so large that you can enjoy it with not to many people around and the list goes on and on. So once we checked out of the estate we rented we ended up extending our vacation and stayed at the Montage for 5 days! That's how much we loved the place! We stayed in a 2 bedroom with an ocean view. Well all the rooms seem to have ocean views. The room was top of the notch. High end everything! And it has air conditioning!!!!! It's a must in Hawaii. The estate we rented didn't have it and it was somewhat miserable with all the humidity and no place to go to cool down and relax. So air conditioning is a must! The pool there is incredible. My 1 1/2 year old was in heaven. Waterfalls all over, bridges, an area where the kids play that the water starts at 1 1/2 ft and goes down to 4 ft. The beach in front of the hotel is the best beach on the island of Maui. It's a quite little bay with minimal people. Snorkeling is so great there with so many fish etc. There's also a area about a 10 min walk down from the hotel where people cliff dive. We did it. So much fun! The spa here is a must. My massage therapist was incredible! Best massage ever! The staff here it what made our stay so perfect!!! They really do love their jobs and do what ever they can to make you feel like a queen and king! I just can't say enough about this hotel!!! 5 stars!!!!!

229103031,50,Wish I could give more than 5 stars,"Our family’s big indulgence is luxury travel. We like the pampering that the finest hotels like Four Seasons, Ritz, Mandarin and St. Regis offer. With so many great resorts on Maui we were reluctant to try a brand new property. We took a chance on the new Montage based on the company’s tremendous reputation in Park City and Laguna and the fact that it offered condo style accommodations within a five star resort. We were not disappointed in our decision.    Our two year old daughter was greeted at check in by a wagon full of high quality stuffed animals and told she could select one. She was then invited to come back to the entry koi pond in the morning to help the staff feed the fish. This daily ritual became one of her favorite Hawaiian activities. The entire staff was fantastic with her.    The hotel grounds were beautiful and the beach was only steps away. Our unit was spacious and luxuriously appointed. The kitchen was truly full-size, with a full-size refrigerator, dishwasher, oven/range and microwave. Every utensil and piece of dishware and barware that we have at home was there including a salad spinner! The 12-cup coffee maker was restocked with a fresh bag of Maui coffee each morning.    The bathrooms were large with high-end finishes, and each master had a huge walk-in closet complete with dressers. The unit had a full size washer and dryer and the hotel even included detergent. The most impressive feature of all was the huge wrap around terrace with picture perfect views in every direction.    The multi-tiered pool had something for everyone. I found a great spot for lap swimming by the restaurant while our daughter had a perfect play area on the long shallow steps near the ocean. The attendants even supplied a complete stock of pool toys each morning.    We’ve been to some of the best spas in the U.S., Asia and Europe and the Montage’s was as good as or better than any of them. The gym has ample cardio equipment and every imaginable strength machine. The spa/ gym facility was beautiful.    By the end our first day at the Montage the entire hotel staff from the restaurant to the front desk knew us and our daughter by name. Wayne, Luby, Melanie, Peter and the rest of the crew couldn’t have done more to pamper us. They were great. If I could, I’d give the Montage Kapalua more than five stars. It was perfect.",Sep 2014,May 2014,Traveled with family,,
229032406,50,The Best in Maui!,"The location, the staff, the activities! There're none better in Maui! We have been guests of this property since it opened in 2009. The advent of the Montage taking over the property in June elevated the experience to an entirely different level. We are thrilled with the enhancements!    Where to begin? Kapalua Bay is stunning and activities abound: golfing on the Plantation (PGA tour) and Bay courses, surfing, paddle boarding, kayaking, scuba diving, snorkeling, whale watching (seasonal) hiking, tennis, horseback riding, parasailing, the list just goes on and on. The Concierge team at the Montage are a wealth of information, so helpful and an absolute pleasure to work with. We would like to especially highlight Nicole, Janet, Ted, Ayami, Jeramiah, Scott and Dennis. They are all so friendly, professional and efficient with reservations. Nicole contacted us prior to our arrival with a host of options for dining, activities and excursions, then arranged for all of our requests, down to the last detail.    Since the Montage took over, ALL dining experiences, from room service, to Cane & Canoe (signature restaurant & bar), to the Sunset Patio have been elevated to five-star status. On the in-room dining menu, I highly recommend the half-baked chocolate cupcake and the surfing goat cheese cake (but the healthier food is GREAT, too!) From Cane & Canoe, the Lobster Bisque, Hamachi Poke, and the Calamari ""Chow Fun"" are phenomenal - a little party for your taste buds(!), and from Sunset Patio, the fish tacos are ALWAYS great: beautiful presentation and scrumptious! From the Cane & Canoe bar, we must mention Brandon, who shucked at least 12 coconuts for us during our stay. We love coconut water, and he was so kind to accommodate us. (Shucking a coconut isn't an easy thing to do, but there is nothing like the taste when you pop a straw in it!)  Thank you!    Spa Montage, in keeping with everything else on the property, is world class. When you step through the doors, you can't help but exhale and relax. Bo is the best masseuse I have ever encountered - bar none! He listens, then puts his expertise to work. You walk out feeling like a new person and trying to figure out when you can schedule another appointment before you leave. For facials, Jan is a master! But in addition to spa services, the gym facilities are some of the best and most extensive we have ever encountered. Thomas and Ben, personal trainers, are consummate professionals and knowledgeable on the current and most advanced training techniques. They also work closely with the masseuses to address various issues, so you have an entire team at your disposal for a holistic approach to your health and well-being.    A couple of other additions the Montage developed are the Mahana Market, located on the concierge level. It has a wonderful selection of pastries, fresh fruit, gourmet selections and local items. Be sure to ask for Kim if you visit, she is so helpful and is always smiling. Another great addition is Pacific Dream Photography. The Kapalua setting is so beautiful, it just beckons family/couple photos, and James Hoot, Creative Director, was wonderful with our family - patient with both adults and children - and quick to laugh. We came home with beautiful, professional photos and will undoubtedly use his services again. - Definitely have the concierge put you in touch with him.    Another person that you MUST meet at the Montage is Auntie Silla. Silla is the cultural director, and is a wealth of knowledge on the Hawaiian culture. She leads activities such as lei making, ukulele lessons and the art of hula. Every time we speak with her, we learn something new. The love of her culture comes shining through and she is an absolute integral part of experiencing Aloha.    For children at Montage, the activities are endless. I highly recommend Paintbox, the children's program. Ashleigh, Sherri and Wainani create a safe, fun atmosphere that is educational (while being completely fun!) and active. It is clear these ladies love what they do, and the children that participate (certainly mine) love them, too. From tide pool excursions, to outdoor scavenger hunts, to pool games, they know how to have fun!    And speaking of the pool, the multi-tiered pool is show-stopper! From the adult infinity pool, all the way to the shallow-entry child friendly pool, the views in every direction are blissful! And the pool staff, and ladies and gentlemen who man the HanaHoa bar are some of the friendliest, hardest working people we have ever encountered. Kiha, Henry and Manu are skilled mixologist, able to whip up a wonderful tropical libation and/or the best child-friendly smoothy in the Pacific. They are great guys to talk to and are so open and willing to share their knowledge of the islands. Couple them with some of the best pool attendants: Lubi, Chris N., Wayne, Peter, Tui, Brian, Chris (TN), Beth, Whitney, Cody, Michelle and their Manager, Drew, and you'll have many great pool days at the Montage!    There are so many additional things that make the Montage experience singular, for instance when you first arrive, the valet staff is top-notch, and throughout your stay you will only come to appreciate them even more. They always wear a smile, are incredibly efficient and great with directions, but it's also the little things like when entering your car, they hand you the seatbelt as they close your door! It's such a nice touch. Thank you to Thomas, Darren, Leah, Brett, Wade, Justice, Jade, Florian and Nainoa! You always make returning to the Montage that much more special and welcoming.    The spacious guest accommodations have stunning views and are well attended and maintained. Housekeeping staff go out of their way to learn everyone's names. We have a special affinity for Maliha, Arcelli and Maria. These ladies and their colleagues go so far beyond what you normally encounter on vacation...Again, it is the spirit of aloha that they embody and share. Thank you. (Oh, and engineering is great with technical assists for the techies in your family. - Thank you, Gary!)    Finally, the property management and leadership create and environment that is welcoming, fun and mindful of the treasure of Kapalua.

223281664,50,A cut above!,"We stayed at Montage Kapalua Bay from 8/2-8/8, a day extra due to Hurricane Iselle. We stayed here with our 4 children, celebrating our wedding anniversary. Before our trip, our concierge was great in helping us with dinner reservations, surfing lessons and other interesting must-do activities and must-see places in Maui. Our personal concierge pointed us to hidden gems like the hippie town of Paia.  The booking was through Iprefer, specifically booking the AMEX stay-more package whereas you can get a $200 spa credit, $50 breakfast credit everyday as well as a room upgrade and possibly a late check-out. Right from the get go, my main concern about Montage Kapalua is their inflexibility with late checkout. During the whole entire process, they couldn't confirm a 4pm checkout for me (even offering to pay extra to do so). I booked this room in April so I was a little irate when two days before arrival, I was told that we must vacate the premises by 11am because there's another family checking in. <take note 11AM> I called reservations as soon as I received the email asking them if we could check-out a day early and check into The Ritz Carlton next door. Using my AMEX Fine Hotels benefits, we could check out at 4pm no extra charge/no questions asked! It would cost us the same for a slightly smaller room but I thought anything would do as long as we could shower and relax before our flight (flight was scheduled at 10pm). So whoever I was speaking to, told me that she could work out a way where we could stay until 4pm but she would need to get it approved first. This whole time, I've been telling them I needed to check-out late so I don't really understand why suddenly they could make this happen for me. I wasn't even going to argue with them because quite frankly, I was all set to go on vacation and was not going to let anything get me down.    I was pretty specific about the time our flight would arrive as well. I informed them that the flight would arrive at 12 and that we would be at the property at 2pm. They were quite aware of this because I received an email from the property manager as soon as our plane landed, welcoming us to Maui, etc. I also gave them a heads-up since May. The flight was delayed in arriving and Delta lost one of our luggage so we were held up at the airport. We also asked our taxi driver for a quick detour to the grocery store so by the time we arrived to the hotel, it was almost 3pm. We we're told that our room was not ready and that it should be ready by 4pm. They showed us the property quickly and forced ourselves to eat at the bar. Take note, we live in California and we are 3 hours behind. Our flight was at 6am and we got out of bed at 4am. Not their fault but it's something that they should keep in mind when welcoming guest (where they are coming from and with 4 kids, we were not quite ready to jump in the pool). Remember the check-out at 11am that they insisted initially? So if the last occupant of this room checked out at 11am? It takes them 5 hours to clean it?  The room was immaculate and I believe we had one of the top floors with 3 bedrooms (2200 sq/ft). It was clean with daily replenishment of water. There were cookies and a jug of milk in the fridge. They personalized everything with a banner welcoming our kids (with their names). The whole property was beautiful and clean. There were beautiful flowers and greenery (and people that worked everyday under the hot sun to keep it that way). They had bocce available at the lawn, they had activities like lei making, hula class and ukelele class for the kids. You can feed the koi fish at 9am daily. The spa was to die and wished I had known about the free lavender sauna. The beach was a 5 minute walk and the water is clear, it's perfect for snorkeling and swimming with turtles. The new restaurant Cane & Canoe was great but pricey. Merriman which is right next to Kapalua Beach is a much cheaper/better alternative.    We had fun but I must say, we've stayed in the Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton before and the service here doesn't quite measure just yet. The day before our original flight on 8/7, I received a call from our airline stating that our flights were cancelled due to to hurricane. They rebooked us for an evening flight the next day. I called the hotel asap to let them know and I am sure that there were a lot of incoming flights that were cancelled too! Anyway, the lady I spoke with was polite but kind of gave me a hard time and wanted proof of the cancellation. American Airlines cancellation and rebooking was automated and you had to press #1 if you accept the alternative flight. I told her that I would forward her the new flight information but that's all I had. She then went on and talked about the rates being higher now, etc, etc. Clearly we would pay for the extra night given that it was weather related. It was not necessary to mention the costs of the room in this situation. We we're stuck there dealing with a hurricane and we couldn't really careless if the room was $200 more. It felt like they didn't want us there.",Aug 2014,August 2014,Traveled with family,,
222028630,50,Mahalo,"Though the hotel has only been a Montage for just over a month, the team is already demonstrating the very best qualities of that brand's reputation for genuine, warm, personal quality service. And the cool part is, they are really giving a 'Hawaii' version of Montage - from the lei greeting upon check in to a breakfast with the freshest pineapple and even bath products that are the same quality as those at all Montage hotels but that emphasize the famous scents associated with Hawaii.    I especially loved my experiences at Cane & Canoe restaurant. The service team is warm, professional and attentive (giving personalization to every meal order to reflect each diner's individual taste) and the food quality is five-star extraordinary. I was especially impressed with both the lamb and the tenderloin entrees and the ahi poke with avocado is precisely what one would expect from poke in Hawaii. The featuring of local beverages - Kona coffee and lager from Maui's brewery - are an especially satisfying and exceptional experience.    I loved meeting the cultural ambassador, Silla, and enjoyed shopping for local goods at their 'Mahana' market. The pool deck that is at the center of the resort is nothing short of magnificent, with its coves and grottos. And there is a great vibe at the Hana Ho bar each night at sunset. The adjacent Kapalua Bay beach is awesome for recreation and there are some awesome dining experiences just off property - Merriman's at the point and the Plantation are both great experiences. I loved both the tennis center and the Kapalua Golf Course, which the resort transportation was happy to get me to with ease. Also, the Spa Montage facility is second to none and the morning yoga class was one perfect way to wake up (and take in an outrageous view of the Pacific).    I recommend a catamaran voyage as part of any Maui visit, but most of all, I just loved relaxing in the outrageously spacious rooms (including full kitchen) and huge stone bathrooms and taking in the endless views of Molokai and Lanai.

My husband, Son and I just spent 6 nights at the hotel. Before we arrived the most amazing concierge contacted me to book our spa appointments, make tennis reservations, suggest Resturants etc. The concierge that I worked with name is Jeramia and really took great care of us durring our entire trip. The service at the hotel is so on point. From being greeted by name by one of the Managers Karima who was so great and took care of checking us in and making sure our room was to our liking. To the people at the spa, at the pool, in-room dining. Speaking of the room. The accomadations are wonderful for families because they are basically all suites I believe. 1, 2 and 3 bedroom. We stayed in a 3 bedroom 3 1/2 bath unit with a full kitchen and washer and dryer and really all the comforts of home. The lanai was huge and we spent a lot of time relaxing and just reading and enjoying the view from the balcony. The pool is fabulous and it is close to the beach path.

220121876,50,Maui's New Benchmark Luxury Resort - Absolute Perfection,"For having been open less than 60 days, my mouth dropped when I experienced service levels that came close to rivaling the Ritz-Carlton Kapalua (next door) at the beginning of our stay. By the 4th day, I was convinced talent & facilities at Montage > Ritz. Each property has its pluses/minuses and I encourage everyone to visit both.    Montage Kapalua Bay is a highly interactive, open-air, oasis resort. Want to feed (or pet) giant coy at the lobby's entrance ponds? Talent provides fish food. Tropical flavored water stations are thoughtfully spread throughout the resort and available when needed. Cold eucalyptus infused towels to cool you down? Discreetly placed mini-fridges hold the trick. Want to climb on rocks or a waterfall? Head to the pool. Kids are present and all well behaved.    I have ridiculously high expectations. I worked for Starwood hospitality ops for 4 years and developed an eye for lapses and imperfections. Also a Starwood Residences Owner and lived in a 5-star property for 3 years. Stayed at the Dorado Beach, a Ritz-Carlton Reserve 3 months after opening and its service/facilities were still disjointed. Montage Kapalua is already functioning as a well-oiled machine and I finally concede tearing down the (former) Kapalua Bay Hotel 8 years ago was the right choice.    Breakfast at the restaurant under the lobby (Cane & Canoe) was off the charts (foodie here). I've been staying next door since an early age and never got to experience local Hawaiian dishes. Cane & Canoe serves Loco Moco (Google it) and Molokai Potato Pancakes. And dishes are priced at half the cost of the $40 international buffet up the road. Happy Hour at the pool bar (from 3-5P) made $14 drinks and $18 nachos affordable.    Never ever want to have to tell a guest ""no"" (least that's what I learned Day 1). Montage Talent went out of their way to fulfill requests meant purposely to throw them off (bad habit). Asked for a ""magical fruity frozen cocktail surprise"" and the bartender delivered a slam-dunk concoction. I was in the mood for coconut shrimp (nowhere on the menu), and Talent immediately radioed the kitchen asking if it had necessary ingredients. Out came 8 jumbo fried shrimp breaded with freshly-shaved coconut. Knocked the socks of Costco's frozen coconut shrimp!    New pool facilities had numerous waterfalls, rock climbing opportunities, bubble-massage beds, a couple well-hidden makeout spots (think: Playboy Mansion Grotto), and at least 2 hot tubs. Like its neighbor, complimentary sunscreen (SPF 50ish) is available upon request.    Aspect that most resonated was the cohesive/warm/family-type energy the new facilities and Talent so generously gave off. Honestly don't remember the last hotel I stayed in where EVERYONE practiced the ""10 and 5"" rule. Montage's Talent were almost excited about (having to) acknowledge me 10 feet away. At 5 feet away, it was full-fledged eye contact and friendly focus. This practice was consistent across all Talent types (Housekeeping, Pool Attendants, F&B, etc.).    Montage Kapalua Bay is situated between two beautiful beaches. One to the left can get cozy with beachcombers. Walk 8 minutes to the right and descend to Oneloa Beach, which sort of rivals a Great Barrier Reef beach.    If you're considering staying on the east side of the island, don't. Drive from Kahalui Airport to Wailea takes 20 minutes and lacks in scenery. Four Seasons, Grand Wailea and Kea Lani are dated properties with little character.

I then received a FULL tour of the facilities which were kept immaculate throughout the entire day. FRESH flower petals were placed w care and cucumbers were conveniently located near the steam room. The steam room was SUPER relaxing due to the eucalyptus oil permeating throughout & the COLD washcloths located just outside.    The PRIVATE women's side had a HOT jacuzzi and a refreshing COLD bamboo shower. There were instructions for an optimal detox utilizing both which I found very helpful.    Next I went outside to the co-ed area to find another HOT jacuzzi & infinity pool which is where i enjoyed lunch (a rarity at most spas I've been to). I decided on their fresh fruit salad & Turkey pesto wrap both were delicious!! The view from the pool was SPECTACULAR as was the service. MICHELLE attended to my every need w such care I felt as if she were there just for ME :) I decided to head down to the beach and she gave me directions & graciously wrapped the rest of my lunch on ice for me to enjoy at the beach (which was a mere 8 min walk away). I then took advantage of the all NATURAL sunscreen spf 45 before heading out.    I enjoyed a little time at the beach then returned to the spa to find they were doing a HAPPY HOUR smoothie special... buy one get one... one I enjoyed poolside the other was put into the freezer to enjoy later :)    I HIGHLY RECOMMEND trying this spa even if your staying at a different hotel... you can get a spa pass for a great price and add on YOGA too!!

There are so many things to do around the hotel- golf at the Plantation course was so wonderful, cliff jumping, hiking, water activities, tennis and so much more we didn't even have time to do! The rooms are enormous with even bigger patios and full kitchens. There is a market inside the hotel for basics and a bigger one just up the road a bit.

214013070,50,Don't make me go home!,"It all began before we arrived when my husband contacted Janet to book our activities and dinners. From that moment on we were in excellent hands. Janet immediately assessed our wants and desires and delivered big time. We played golf on the Plantation Course (spectacular), rode horses from the Mendes Ranch (only ranch on the island where you can run the horses), spent the 4th of July on the Hula Girl catamaran watching the fireworks on the water and went zip lining in Kapalua! Our dinner reservations were made and taxis all arranged. That was before we even set foot on the property. The other reviews say it all. The place is pristine and spectacular. I don't think the word ""no"" is in their vocabulary. So, without repeating the rave reviews of others, I want to speak about the special people who deserve mentioning. Along with Janet, we loved chatting with Audrey. She was always interested in our days and our dinners. My husband got up early and went to the Mahana Market for coffee. The woman always asked about our plans and was generally interested in what we would be doing. After a breathtaking walk along the coastal trail or a more vigorous one around the lake loop, our mornings started out with Christine or Kane for breakfast, with Sam making sure I had my decaf and lots of water. At the pool, Beth made sure we were hydrated and full, and Manu at the pool bar fixed us great island drinks. Speaking of bars, Mitch and Matt were the best. They were always up for good conversations, great drinks and some malasadas (not to be missed donuts) at the Cane and Canoe bar.

You are also within walking distance to 2 amazing golf courses. I tried the Bay Course and found this course perfect for those who want great views and a somewhat forgiving layout. If you are looking to do just 9 holes, check out the twilight times to save some cash as you have to pay for all 18 regardless.    The best part of the hotel, is the spa.

212981367,50,Heaven in Maui for families,"We just came back from a magical week at the Montage in Maui. I cannot say enough good things about this special resort.    The property is just spectacular. The lobby is open and airy, providing an elegant yet relaxing stage for the expansive facility. The pools are sophisticated but welcoming. Connected by tunnels and caves with an occasional waterfall, there are a variety of places to cool off while also providing variety for the kids to enjoy. The hona hut by the pool provides easy access to delicious drinks (Ask the bartender Manu to make you one of his signature lava flow or chi-chi - with or without alcohol). They even had a family movie night by the pool one night -- a drive-in by the beach!    The Kapalua beach is a short walk away. It's small and welcoming - making it easy for anyone to try snorkeling or boogie boarding for the first time. Montage guests get access to beach chairs and discounts on equipment rental making the experience seamless and easy to enjoy in short durations. We also enjoyed use of the great tennis courts across the street at the Kapalua tennis garden. Courts were always available and there was a well stocked tennis store to give us balls and access to rackets if needed. The Pineapple Grill next store was also a great place for a casual and delicious dinner.    Beyond the physical beauty and peaceful setting of this extraordinary property, the spectacular service and attention to detail are what really makes the experience a special standout. Every person we met who worked there seemed to have a personal mission statement of making sure our family vacation exceeded expectations. Every morning was greeted with multiple ""Aloha's"" and every question was answered with a ""sure, we can do that."" Stacy at the Cane and Canoe, Montage's signature restaurant (which is also delicious), went out of her way to drop off a fish guide for my kids at our room after they excitedly told her about the fish they saw snorkeling that day.    Mornings were filled with yoga at their gorgeous fitness facility (open view of the beach) or runs on the scenic coastal trail. The fitness instructors were friendly and knowledgeable - definitely a good workout for all levels.    The rooms are beautifully appointed and spacious.

208241849,50,Our Best Ever Hawaii Resort Stay,"For our 25th wedding anniversary, my wife and I decided to ramp things up a bit and treat ourselves to a bit of luxurious vacationing. Life is short and each day should be a celebration, right? Rather than spend our dollars on air travel, my wife and I drove to the other side of Maui for a “stay-cation” at the recently remodeled and rebranded Montage Kapalua Bay Resort.    The Montage had no feeling of “hotel” as I checked in for our week long stay. The ambience was that of “family and friends,” where all the staff was encouraged to know each guest by name. Such a high-end resort might have oozed feelings of snobbery, but I felt the total opposite, as if I was completely welcomed into the home of a longtime neighbor. By the end of our stay, we had become personal friends with bellmen, concierges, housekeeping, pool and bar attendants, the cultural director, as well as the managing director of the resort.    The unique design of the very large center courtyard swimming pool allowed for every guest to find a private pool, lagoon, or waterfall. The maze of water plunged down three terrace levels. With each level offering a direct view of the ocean with Moloka’i Island on the horizon. I swam one evening under the stars and the flickering glow of the torches. It felt like being on a deserted South Pacific island.    At the Montage, every room is a suite – either two bedroom or three bedroom. Our room #2704 was a jaw-dropper with two master suites, two large walk-in closets, three humongous bathrooms, a full-sized kitchen with top-of-the-line appliances including built-in wine refrigerator. Oh, back to the bathrooms – the “toilet room,” the bath, the marble shower, and the double-sink vanity area was accessible via double French doors. The lighting and appointments were perfectly comforting. (I have been to other hotels that have needlessly placed telephones and flat-screen TV’s in the bathroom; not my style.) Instead, curtains on the large picture window directly behind the oversized tub could be drawn to reveal a stunning view of the coastline.    Our balcony was the crown jewel of the suite. It had way more than enough room for the four lounge recliners and also a four-seat patio table. I think 20 people could have a cocktail party on our balcony, and it appeared every other room at the resort had a similar arrangement. Both bedrooms had sliding doors leading to the balcony – this was perfect as our two college aged kids came to stay for a few nights during out visit.    As incredible as our suite was to lounge around in, I discovered three “hidden jewels” that I want to share with future guests, as I might have easily missed any of these in passing. I highly suggest you discover these places also:    1) The Beach Club Pool and Bar – this tiny infinity pool is virtually hidden, yet has one of the best locations on Maui. It is tucked in to a corner of the Montage, between buildings, with a direct view of the stunning blue waters of Kapalua Bay. The atmosphere is casual, and the food and drinks are fabulous. We became friends with Lori and Lisa, both long-time hostesses there.  2) The Spa Montage – from the front of the building, you would never guess there is a full-sized oasis of self-indulgence inside. Ask for the 10-minute tour and you will be sold! I am not a “spa person,” but this place trapped me in for some complete quiet time one morning.  3) The Cliff House – This unique old home was built into the rocky cliff about 30 feet above the water of an ideal crystal clear bay. It is not the actual structure that you are looking for, but the smooth sunbathing rocks on the far side. A five-ten minute walk from the Montage will take you around a trail on the north side of the Cliff House. It is a bit rocky and steep at the end. You will end up at a favorite local hangout where you can sit on smooth rocks, watching sea turtles, and snorkelers below you, all while being sheltered from the normal Maui trade winds. This bay has a magical feeling.    We were staying there during the final phases of construction of the new fine-dining restaurant, and so I cannot remark on this feature as we were not able to partake in the food of view. (The minor areas of construction were not bothersome at all. Actually, this helped us select the Montage Kapalua Bay as our destination as we were offered a nice room price in exchange for any inconvenience!)    I now have a richer understanding about the overall “sense of place” and history of Kapalua. This is something I did not expect. The many centuries of Hawaiian inhabitants of this place left archeological and spiritual reminders of cultural significance that beg us to respect the land and protect it for future generations. Try to take some time and read-up about Kapalua before you arrive, then you will have a greater appreciation for this land.    All-in-all, my wife and I have discovered our new favorite Hawaii getaway. The Montage Kapalua Bay will become a top recommendation for friends coming to Maui. While we are lucky enough to live here on the other side of the island, it was indeed difficult to pack the car and head home at the end of our anniversary week.

We had been advised beforehand that there was construction going on, but we were not bothered by it. It was done tastefully and in an out-of-the-way manner. I'm excited to see what the finished product will look like.    There are many paths surrounding the Residences and it's a short 5-10 minute walk to the ocean. The grounds are peaceful and well-maintained and the swimming pools were a huge plus.

It was outstanding, but while there was construction going on in our area, there was discussion about moving to another residence. I asked to peek at the residence to see if it would work for us. I have to admit I was surprised they were the exact same as they were when we'd stayed in 2009. There could be a small residence refresh in order when Montage goes fully online with the hotel portion of the property. It would be wise to do so.    The main pool on the property is our favorite anywhere. Most of the pool was closed while we were there until the next to last day of our stay. The pool staff was amazing and we really enjoyed our drinks and lunches. It looks as though with all of the construction going on, that the property will just improve over the next year or two. We will definitely be back.",Apr 2014,April 2014,Traveled with family,,"Geneva, Illinois"
199594985,50,Staff reward trip,"Ok, the Residence ruined it for me. I will no longer stay anywhere else when I come to Maui. I have been to this island about 20 times over the past 20 years for work and once for pleasure. I have stayed in condos, hotels and this was by far my best place to stay. We had the three room villa and had a fantastic time. The place is under renovation but they were not working during our stay even though we were advised that they would be working. My staff arrived a day before I did and I had them stay in Lahaina at a resort. They were fine with the experience but were overwhelmed when I brought them to this place for the rest of our stay.  Rob, the valet guy to Kristen in reservations, the service was great, worthy of me sharing in my presentations (I am a leadership expert/keynoter) with groups. The weather was spotty but the accommodations made up for the off / on sun poking out. In fact, the staff would have stayed in the room if I did not force them to go out and see the island. Being from the West coast, it was great to rise early, sip coffee while sitting on the lanai watching the ocean.  The kitchen allowed me to cook the final night dinner for my staff (5) and the 3 friends who were on the island at the same time. The cleanliness, locale, and the staff were wonderful. If you have been to Hawaii, you knew that you can find "" dated"" and underwhelming places to stay... this is not one of them. It may be a bit pricier but at this stage in my life, I am worth it, have had my share of budget rooms and if I am going to fly my staff over we should enjoy the place where we are laying our heads down at night. I know this is becoming a Montage property so it is only going to get better. My biggest challenge was getting the Bose sound system to work. Life should be so rough.  Thanks for the great experience and I look forward to returning a lot sooner than I had planned. Kudos to all.

The staff went out their way to remember our names and interest. Construction is occuring, but we were informed ahead of arrival and really wasn't an issue. The only issue we had was the family above not controlling their children's noise level. At times we thought it was thundering, unsure what they were doing. Next visit we will request top floor. We went down to Westin area shopping and for surf lessons, but we were glad to return to a quiet location.

You will see equipment and workmen who will politely let you pass. Would it be better if they weren't there, sure, but don't let it stop you from staying here. We had a 5th floor, 3 bedroom unit that was HUGE and had everything you could possibly want, top of the line appliances, beautiful bathrooms and a large balcony. The staff could not have been more friendly. They always asked where we were off to and offered opinions and advice. The food at the restaurant and at the pool was great and the service was too. The breakfast spot did take some time to get the food out and one meal was not hot but honestly, that was the only negative in 8 days and it was minor.

194336894,50,our best (and most memorable) vacation ever. above and beyond service,"After 15+ vacations to Hawaii (between the two of us) and travels around the world, this is all around the most memorable and exceptional resort we've stayed at.  The grounds are beautiful and well-maintained, the pools are unforgettable (serenity pool followed by more pools/grottos overlooking the ocean), views (whale blowholes and clear sunsets even from the lanai) were dynamite. The beach and tide pools were so nice that we barely left the resort. The rooms were large, clean, bright, comfortable, and quiet. The menu at the restaurant was limited, but everything on it was delicious (down to the perfectly cooked jasmine rice). We also loved the koi pond, and details like the herb garden.  We're a bit biased, as my then boyfriend and now fiancee, proposed at the Kapalua Bay beach at sunset, right after a turtle swam up towards shore.  The exceptional service at The Residences at Kapalua Bay started from the moment that we stepped on the property as we were greeted with warm smiles. The staff went the extra mile to make our engagement extra special - they put together a stunning bouquet of flowers from the grounds and every employee genuinely congratulated us throughout our stay. The front of house, Caitlin (and her very sweet sister Casey) and housekeeping really stood out to us. Caitlin unprompted, took, printed, and framed photos of our engagement and sent them to our room! Even the bartenders gave us tips on places to go and see, treated us to an engagement toast, and told us that if there was anything we shouldn't hesitate to ask... Honestly, we didn't even need to ask because everything was flawless. We were treated like family here.  My whole family (including my 5 year old nephew who loved the pool, my mom who enjoyed the yoga classes) had a wonderful and relaxing vacation thanks to The Residences. Needless to say, we were sad to leave... I teared up when the concierge hugged me goodbye, but my fiancee promised that we'd be back!  A huge thank you to the staff at The Residences at Kapalua Bay!",Feb 2014,February 2014,Traveled with family,,"Mountain View, California"
194168118,50,Can't wait to come back!,"From the moment we pulled up to the valet to our departure 6 days later, everyone at the Residences at Kapalua Bay (now managed by Montage) made our trip amazing and special. Prior to our arrival, we were contacted by Ted the concierge, who offered us various options for activities and arranged for a sunset dinner reservation at Merriman's. My sister's boyfriend was planning a proposal on our 2nd day, and the entire resort seemed in on the surprise. A special thanks to sisters Casey and Caitlyn who went above and beyond to make my sister's special trip so wonderful and personal (they were able to capture my sister and fiance's special moment on the beach on film and had the photos printed and delivered to their room at turn down service as a surprise). We have stayed in many 5 star resorts and hotels in our many years of travel, and the Residences exceeded our every expectation -- from the Frette sheets and comfy beds to the delicious (albeit limited) menus at the Sunset Grill & Bar (hopefully by the time Montage full takes over and redevelops the restaurant, there might be room service??). The pool is perfect for all ages - with tiers for kids, from baby to teenage, and a serenity pool exclusively for adults. Kapalua beach is a mere 3 minute stroll (towels & chairs are complimentary for guests of the Residences).

192585719,50,Excellent All Around--Good Hotel Alternative,"We like hotels, OK? Room service and the like. But, if we are after a vacation rental with hotel-like amenities, we will stay here again. The setting is amazing, views superb, our unit was immaculate, huge and well appointed (three bedroom). The staff is very friendly and helpful at all times. The pool area is very well designed and in fact better than most hotel pools because it affords more small areas and quiet spaces, most with great views. The concierge staff is very, very helpful. But, hotel-like does not mean hotel. The food service is limited (reasonably available, but not always) and the menus limited. The bar scene is limited, though the bar at the pool is a great spot. So, it is a hybrid--more residential than the Ritz, but with fewer hotel amenities. If that's what you are after, this is the place.

Beautiful resort with the most friendly staff I have ever encountered. We were there for the week prior to Christmas and the resort was fairly quiet right up until Christmas day. Rooms are lovely, we had a ground floor that opened up right into the pool area. They did our grocery shopping for us so with our late arrival it was worth the 30% fee. It is a bit of a drive into Lahaina, but really that is not a problem as you have no need to leave the resort. They have a new owner from what we were told and are making some changes the first part of this year, I hope they do not change too much! Spent 2 days at the lovely spa, took a GREAT Hula class from Paulie and learned how to make the flower pieces for my hair. Lovely morning walks full of rainbows at the bird sanctuary trail.

175026337,50,A great condo with the best ocean view,"We have stayed 6 nights in oceanfront villa #20G5 and absolutely loved it. We rented the villa through Quam Properties and were able to secure one with ocean frontage.    The whole Kapalua Bay Villas site is a very large and comprises of hundreds of condos, private houses and villas.    By booking through Quam, we saved approximately 50% in comparison to booking with the Kapalua Bay Villas directly. In doing so, you still have access to the three swimming pools on site, and the advantage of living amongst owners rather than at a vacation resort is the pools are empty all the time!    A real bonus is that there was an ocean front trail walk, which was a good way to start the day. The trail also extends down to the DT Fleming beach, which is a nice small beach utilised by the guests of the Ritz Carlton next door and hence, is extremely well maintained and monitored.    Bear in mind that Kapalua is a fair distance from anywhere else. It is about 20 minutes drive from Laihana, and over an hour from the start of the Road to Hana and also Wailea. So as long as you have a car, its not too much of an issue. It also appears have the most magnificent views and vistas of anywhere along the west coast of Maui.

166658394,50,A Winning Combination - Incredible Rooms and Facilities + Unsurpassed Service (without asking),"I would rate the Residences 10 stars if I could. There are 2 primary reasons for our great experience.    1) The Facilities and Suites are incredible - literally a paradise. We had a 2 bedroom that was huge with an incredible view of the Ocean and the Pool area. Every morning we could look out and see the beautiful of Lanai island. Each residence has their own private elevator where you are the only residence on that floor. We could leave our swim gear and toys outside in the hallway. The Patio off of our room was huge with a eating area, lounge area, and seating area. In Maui, you use the patio as much as the actual room. All of the appliances, decorations, furniture are newly appointed and modernly decorated. There is also free wifi everywhere on the resort. The pool is incredible and truly beautiful. The winding lagoon style of the pool is where you could have your own private area of the pool. The food at the pool (which they bring to you) was very good and reasonably priced for Maui.    2) The staff and the level of service was the best I have been around and we have traveled to many five star resorts. The concierge team was incredible, thru email, Ted helped us plan our entire stay prior to our arrival including some great recommendations based on his experience. That allowed us to enjoy our time at Maui and it also ensured we had reservations for restaurants, activities, and tours as the good ones do sellout.    The valet team was also outstanding (Leigh). They anticipated without waiting to be asked. For example, we mentioned that we were going on the Road to Hana the next day. Without me asking, they said they would put towels in the car, a cooler with ice, and allow us to borrow a CD that guided you. When we would go out to dinner they would ask where and get a menu with any coupons (in Maui, any coupons are helpful) that they may have. They also would mention some of the best items on the menu. So on one of our excursions, I sat on chewing gum with my swim trunks. I mentioned to Leigh if they had any suggestions. They promptly got some Goo Gone and took my swim trunks and proceeding to carefully remove the gum and THEN had them washed at housekeeping. They brought them back to our residence after a few hours, ready to be used the next day. Unsurpassed service.    Overall, The manager Jesse and his team do a great job and truly care about you and your stay in Kapalua. From now on, I know exactly where we will stay when we return to Maui.

160996540,50,Six Star Resort,"We recently had the pleasure of staying at the Residences at Kapalua Bay in West Maui. I have to give this resort 6 stars. The indigenous flora and fauna and beautifully landscaped grounds with multi level pools flowing towards the Pacific Ocean is a view you simply cannot get tired of. The Hawaiian style artwork and décor together with the warmth from local wood in the doorways and furniture give the resort a feeling of grace and charm you might expect to find in Hawaii many years ago. The staff at the pool and poolside restaurant are so accommodating you want to spend the whole day relaxing beneath the swaying palm trees with the natural air conditioning of the cooling trade winds. We ate lunch at the pool bar twice. The food was excellent and very reasonably priced by hotel standards. The calm protected white sandy swimming beach just footsteps away from the pool is one of Maui's better snorkeling spots. We were pleasantly surprised to see green sea turtles among the large variety of reef fish in the bay.    The spa is truly awesome. I was told it won best spa in America 2 years in a row, and its easy to see why. There's a well equipped fitness center with personal trainers, indoor and outdoor massage treatment areas, a coffee and health food snack bar, a salt water infinity pool and Jacuzzi, and the locker rooms are equipped like nothing I have ever seen before, including steam rooms, saunas, and more Jacuzzis.    The resort offers only suites and has an intimate and elegant feel without the massive cold marble feel of some other properties. We stayed in a two bedroom unit on the top floor, beautifully furnished with soft colors, exotic woods, Hawaiian quilts on the beds, a full kitchen with gorgeous granite counter tops. There was even a laundry room in this unit with a full size washer and dryer. The huge deck with incredible ocean views and the island of Molokai just a few miles away made a great place to relax with a book or newspaper and coffee in the morning. Both bedrooms were master suites with master baths, so no hard feelings if you are traveling with another couple.    The staff are professional and engaging with impeccable service, yet still very island style. The Aloha Spirit is alive and well here. The concierge were exceptionally helpful and always with a welcoming smile. For dinner we strolled down the beach path and had a wonderful dining experience at Merrimans Restaurant. This is a fine dining restaurant with a superb location overlooking the beach. It is one of several good restaurants within walking distance of the resort. This ""Residences at Kapalua"" Resort is located on the lush north west corner of Maui which is home to two world class golf courses, a very scenic coastline, and a well developed system of hiking trails.

Several restaurants are within easy walking of the Residences. Make reservations in advance for Merrimans or sit on their ocean-front deck and have dinner under the stars. We did both. Sansei Restaurant is located about half a mile and is known as the place for sushi.    The two bedroom, 2 bath unit offers a large covered deck with panoramic views of Molokai and the sunset.

We also saw many sea turtles, some of them came right up onto the beach. The resort is very quiet and private so it felt like we had our own private pool. There is a fantastic beach with good snorkeling right on the property. There is also another amazing snorkeling spot just north of the property called Honolua Bay – don’t miss it! It is a 5 minute walk through the jungle and there is no beach there but the snorkeling is amazing. Merriman’s restaurant is almost on the property and definitely worth visiting, several times! Another favorite restaurant is the Pinapple Grill – don’t miss their upside down pineapple cake. You will go back for seconds!
