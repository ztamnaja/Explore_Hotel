841145134,50,Honeymoon in paradise,"Wow, I knew from looking at the pictures of this B&B that it was going to be lovely but nothing compares to actually arriving there. The innkeepers were all so kind and accommodating. I don't think I've ever felt more welcomed at a hotel.    We asked if we could drop our luggage off at the desk early on our check in date as we were going to volcanoes national park and they generously and kindly accepted our request and even moved our luggage into our room prior to our late arrival. We arrived back at the inn late that evening and saw the most beautiful starry sky, outlook over Kona, and the ocean in the background. It was glorious. The view from the inn night and day is indescribable. The inn is so quiet and calm at night I had the best night's sleep ever! That being said, I would not recommend children or loud partiers to this inn. It is purely about relaxation and recuperation and everyone is mostly quiet and respectful.    The beds are so comfortable, I'm still missing the amazing sleep I had while there. Our room had a king sized bed a tub/shower, and a outdoor private hot tub which still provided great views overlooking kona and the ocean. Our room was called the coffee cherry room.    The breakfasts every morning were incredible! Started the day off with some delicious freshly ground and brewed Kona coffee grown on the plantation, followed by the freshest orange juice I've ever tasted and a yummy fresh fruit plate, all grown on the plantation or gathered from local farms. The breakfasts changed every day, but they were all incredible, healthy, and unique.    For lunch & dinner the innkeepers can give you recommendations in Kona which is about a 15-20 minute from the inn. We rented a car, but we also Uber-ed one night and found it easy to get an Uber there and back. There are also some small snack shops and stores within walking distance of the inn.    We were able and encouraged to explore the entire place. We were even allowed to take and eat fruits that we found. I love to do yoga and the inn supplied yoga matts as well as beach towels and beach supplies.    There are so many positive things about this inn, I think I could write a whole book. I am so thankful we got to spend a portion of our honeymoon and the only con about this place is that we couldn't stay longer! We will definitely return in the future.",Jun 2022,May 2022,,Coffee Cherry room has a private hot tub,"Medinah, Illinois"
839979755,50,Amazing *****,"From the moment we arrived to the moment that we left, Holualoa Inn and the staff were perfect on every way. We stayed in the Gardeneria suite which was absolutely stunning. The Inn is so peaceful, clean, homely, comfortable, dreamy bed linen, deliciously prepared breakfasts, amazing home baked snacks and wonderful friendly and attentive staff. We booked based on trip advisor reviews and I wish we had stayed longer - but it’s a reason to go back!  I would 100% highly recommend the Inn as a must for a stay in Hawaii, I guarantee no one will be disappointed.",May 2022,May 2022,Traveled as a couple,,"London, United Kingdom"
832872614,50,The Perfect Place for a Relaxing Stay,"The Holualoa Inn check all the boxes my wife and I were looking for in a relaxing five night vacation. The Inn is a 30 acre property, extremely quiet and isolated a few thousand feet on a mountain overlooking the Kona Coast. There aren't that many rooms and while we were there it was primarily filled with adult couples. Kona coffee and fruit trees are located all around the property and we were encouraged to eat any of the ripe fruit. The staff was outstanding!!! Everyone was very friendly, helpful and went out of their way to make sure everything during our stay was absolutely perfect. The food was exceptional-breakfasts were all great along with the special lunch that was prepared for us after a private yoga session. We asked them to make us sack lunches a couple of days for our excursions and they were fantastic! (the veggie wrap was terrific). All in all my wife and I found The Holualoa Inn to be a perfect place for a relaxing stay.",Mar 2022,March 2022,,,"Orange County,CA"
828087440,50,Exceeded Expectations,"My partner, and friends, love this Inn. The setting is spectacular, set in the middle of a coffee farm, overlooking the ocean. The service from the staff was great. We really enjoyed meeting them. The rooms are beautiful and the public space is charming. You could easily stay on the property the whole time and have a great trip. We also enjoyed the delicious breakfasts and afternoon snacks. We ordered dinner in one night and ate in the dining room.

Ina (sp?) made us feel so welcome the moment we pulled in the drive and treated us elegantly from that point on.

822844815,50,Wonderful estate that excels in service,"Beautiful. Comfortable. Fantastic base of operations.  The views are unmatched! Just gorgeous.  We stayed 5 nights. We actually spent a day or two just relaxing at the Inn.  Take a walk around the whole property, and you can skip tours of island agricultural farms.  Service was fantastic. Ina, Shawna, Audrey, and Rhonda were particularly helpful at every opportunity.  Great breakfasts and coffee in the morning. Snacks later in the day.  They do have an outdoor grill and frig for use, but realize that you will need to obtain lunch and dinner off site every day. In other words, the Inn is a super upscale bed-and-breakfast. There were others staying at the Inn, but other than breakfast, we didn't see others very often so it seemed like our own private resort!  The island is big! Plan on driving 45 minutes to 1.5 hours everywhere, but this will likely be true any place that you stay.  There was no air conditioning, but a fan in the room worked very well to keep us cool.    Even if you are vaccinated (as we were), I’d recommend waiting on a trip to Hawaii until the Covid-related mandates are lifted, as they clearly diminished Hawaii’s “Aloha” spirit. Also, be aware that various amenities are missing and mask mandates are extensive, and extend even to the outdoors (truly, and in practice). You absolutely should not go if you are not vaccinated as most businesses will deny you entry.",Dec 2021,November 2021,,"2nd floor, as 1st floor can be seen from outside","Atlanta, Georgia"

Breakfast was delicious and the innkeepers super friendly. Lots of amenities, like washer and dryer, to help pack light. Also really appreciated the snorkel gear and other beach equipment. Majorly helpful. Lastly, I liked being high up, not only for the view, but also for the decrease in temperature. Worth a stay if you want a quiet, contemplative retreat away from the hustle of the shore (which is a short drive ... very downhill ... away.)",Aug 2021,June 2021,,Ask for a room with a view.

The grounds are just breathtaking and very well kept, breakfast is incredibly delicious (and you get that Kona coffee!), innkeepers are all so friendly and helpful, the bed and room was comfy and lastly it was just a peaceful place to be! We felt very at peace during our stay and cannot wait to go back! If you are looking for a place to go that is away from the resorts this is it.

788035682,50,Priceless tranquility,"On a hillside in Hawaii, surrounded by splendid gardens, lush vegetation, early morning mist and evenings flush with the glow of sunset, sits the Holualoa Inn. Hands down the most relaxing, beautiful and thoughtfully designed experience to which we have ever been privy. Every detail speaks of calmness and of enjoyment.  We stayed here for our much delayed honeymoon in April and could not have been gifted a more perfect and special location for this occasion. The staff was gracious and helpful, without being intrusive. It was as if we were in our own place with friends who would come by just to say hi and see if we needed anything.  With all sincerity, we recommend this place. For anyone seeking stillness, beauty and quiet. For any couple wanting to experience something inspiring while sharing with only a few other lucky guests. If you can only afford the time or capital for one night, we wholeheartedly recommend this stay.    P.S. Leave the windows open. Listen to the frogs and crickets as they go about their night, to settle you to sleep.

750475106,30,Not,"We returned to the Holualoa recently after a 10 year absence. We felt lucky to get a room for the last night we were going to be on the BI. Our accommodations were very nice, but too close to the driveway and road (noisy), also attention to detail has diminished, we discovered mold in the water pitcher and several glasses looked like they had been stored unwashed. Yes, I might be picking nits but for the money spent, I think everything should have been perfect. It was also disappointing to see that smoking is allowed on the premises as the overflowing ashtray in the gazebo attested to.  I will say that the grounds are still stunning and the breakfast was delicious.",Mar 2020,March 2020,Traveled as a couple,,"Paauilo, Hawaii"

It took us a couple of years before we could get back, and it was just as terrific as the first time. The location is very tranquil, very zen like, which is a rare counterpoint to the usual hectic scene at most Hawaii resorts. The breakfasts are exceptional, each plating uniquely visual as well as delicious. Don't miss going to the nearby restaurant Holuakoa Gardens & Cafe. Terrific for lunch and dinner - a long walk or a short drive away. And much much closer than any other quality dining options.

We stayed in the Gardenia suite for 4 nights, between the comfortable sitting room with spectacular ocean views and the bedroom (complete with balcony) we had 270 degree views of the Kona coast around to the coffee plantation. Breakfast was always a delicious surprise, always starting with beautiful fresh fruit. We walked to dinner at nearby Holuakoa Gardens 2 nights (great food), and took advantage of the completely outfitted guest kitchen (next to the pool) 2 nights, grilling our food and meeting other friendly travelers.

The brunch prepared by Gabriella was wonderful and beautifully presented.

682461025,50,A Hidden Gem,"If you are looking for an intimate, low key but upscale property the Holualoa Inn has it all. Located in the foothills above Kailua, the Inn is situated in the small artist community of Holualoa and affords a commanding and beautiful view of the ocean. Within walking distance of the Inn is an excellent restaurant and cafe, a mini-mart, and post office. Strolling along the road there are quite a few art galleries to visit, featuring local Hawaiian work.    Holualoa Inn is conveniently located to many restaurants, shops and beaches within a 10 to 15 minute drive. It is an easy and even scenic commute from Kona airport to the Inn, with the trip taking about 25 minutes.    Holualoa Inn is managed by a great team, all very approachable and responsive. The Inn is impeccably maintained. All accommodations and common areas are open air (no air conditioning) but with the trade winds was comfortable throughout our stay.    Breakfasts were delicious, using local fare and varied each day. The kitchen was quite accommodating for special diet requests and if you are a coffee lover, you are in for a real treat, as the coffee beans used are grown on their own property.    We stayed at the Darrell Hill cottage, which is set a bit apart from the Inn. This cottage, named after a well reputed local artist, has a full and well stocked kitchen along with all the other amenities of a large hotel suite. We loved waking up to the birds and roosters and appreciated the yoga mats provided, which we used each morning on the verandah.    The Inn has a lovely pool area with another terrific view of the ocean. Around the pool are assorted and comfortable seating and lounge areas, providing both sun and shade. When the clouds roll down the mountain, usually by late morning, head down to the many beautiful beach areas. The Inn has umbrellas, beach chairs and even a cooler to lend. Don't forget to check out the hot tub -- set apart from the pool in a covered area, it affords another wonderful place to relax and take in the beauty of the Big Island.    There are many small details and touches that make the Holualoa Inn special, just a few noted above. It was the perfect place to celebrate our 40th Wedding Anniversary.

Breakfast was a special culinary surprise every day and also our daughter could look forward every morning to a great muesli.

Very secluded, with two balconies, a small kitchenette and ocean views from everywhere, including the bathroom :) The location was great, being a bit up the hillside and we did not miss being near the water at all as we had excursions which provided plenty of that.

657423845,50,Feels like home,"What a dream the Holualoa Inn is! From the moment you check in, this place feels different. It's a former private residence and you are encouraged to make yourself at home. We stayed in the Hibiscus room for 4 nights and moved to the Coffee Cherry room for our final night as Hibiscus was already booked. Both rooms were very comfortable although we definitely preferred Hibiscus. Coffee Cherry has a private hot tub and quiet garden sitting area toward the back of the hotel. Hibiscus has unparalleled views over the island and the most comfortable bed we've ever slept in. Picture sleeping in a cloud and you would be pretty close to the comfort level! The bath products were delightfully citrus-y, we wished we could bring them home with us. The hotel has it's own coffee and is available for your drinking enjoyment all day, unfortunately we only had room in our suitcases for one bag of beans. The communal breakfast situation is not our preference, but the views over the island and the delicious food make up for the lack of private dining. The hotel replenishes your beach towels every day and also provides free guest laundry facilities. We thought ""who wants to do laundry in Hawaii??"" but in the end, we actually used the facilities as our trip was only half over when we (sadly) left Hawaii. There is also a BBQ grill and fridge for guest use, we considered getting some lovely fish to grill, but ran out of time. The hotel also provides snorkel and beach equipment (chairs, etc.), which is something we wished we had known about before dragging our snorkel equipment across the country (and then some). We could have left them at home and had room for more coffee! There are not too many dining options up in the village of Holualoa, however it's not a big deal to drive into town for food. We would 100% return to Holualoa and have already recommended it to our friends and family.

656169626,50,Excellent Hotel on the Big Island,"My wife and I recently spent a week at the Holualoa Inn. We had high expectations from the recent New York Times write-up and the the hotel website. We were not disappointed. The hotel is located about 10 min from Kailua-Kona and just under half an hour from the Kona airport on the west (dry) side of the big island. The location is close enough to be convenient for day trips but removed from the tourist bustle of Kailau.    The provided breakfast is excellent with fresh fruit and a variety of warm options that were not repeated during our stay. Additionally, the hotel staff was very considerate of our dietary restrictions. Being on a coffee plantation, the Kona coffee was needless to say excellent. You also have access to more beans in your room if you feel like more later in the day. The light snack provided later in the day (4PM) is also a nice touch.    We spent the first 6 days of our stay in the (Darrell Hill) Cottage. This offers excellent privacy without walls adjoining other guest suites. There is also ample room for 2 people with a changing room and large wrap around porch with excellent elevated ocean view. There is also a large private kitchen and grill. We really appreciated not having to go out to eat every night and were able to stay in several evenings and enjoy the view.    The last night we stayed in Hawaii the collage was booked so we stayed in the Plumeria suite which we would also recommend. It was next to the shared kitchen facilities on the first floor and the beautiful tiled pool. Given that it was on the first floor the view was less impressive but still offered excellent accommodation at a slightly lower price point. Also light sleepers might want to consider a suite in the main building as there is significantly less road/nature noise. While my wife found the feral roosters charming I was not equally enamored, though this is largely out of the hotel's hands. The rooms were both spotless, all the more impressive considering the tropical location. Highly recommended.",Mar 2019,February 2019,Traveled as a couple,,"Copenhagen, Denmark"
654109584,50,Bliss on the Big Island,"Everything about the Holualoa Inn was special. It's a small property (not many rooms) so they really treat you like family. The coffee is fantastic estate-grown Kona (they have 30,000 trees!). Breakfasts were prepared for us and served in the beautiful dining room, high over the ocean. There was a artistically tiled pool (a little chilly to swim on our visit in February) and also a hot tub, all with expansive views of the coastline below. There was a guest kitchen for our use so we could grill some Ona Salmon for dinner one evening. They also had snorkel and beach gear available for the guest's use, which made our trip complete (go to Two Step if you can!). We were only able to stay for two nights but it was so perfect and we would love to return.",Feb 2019,February 2019,Traveled as a couple,,
651366266,50,A gem,"We booked the red barn for four nights, and our stay was near perfect. The room was equisite and enormous—I doubt we would have found anything nicer anywhere on the island. The details were superb, from subtitle architectural flourishes to gorgeous wood floors to incredible creative breakfasts served daily. A true zen feel; we felt fortunate that we were welcome there with small kids. Truly, we were made to feel welcome from the first moment to last, including when some last minute construction nearly caused a major damper on our stay. But this is where the attention to detail comes in—not only did I receive a call from the owner herself after my complaint but she went to incredible lengths to make it right. Cannot wait to come back and stay longer. Thank you Holualoa Inn.",Feb 2019,February 2019,Traveled with family,,"Brooklyn, New York"
645926706,50,A little slice of paradise,"We stayed here for 4 nights in January to end our vacation trip around a couple of Hawaiian Islands. It was a bit of luxury to end the trip, as it was rather expensive we thought per night. However the privacy, service and views that you get are second to none. It's worth spending the extra money to stay here.    We would definitely return here again, but we would choose a different room as our Plumeria Suite was on the ground floor underneath where the breakfast was served so we were woken up at 6.30am every morning by people walking on the wooden floor above us which was a shame. The suite is also not very private as people walk past all the time, so you have to draw the blinds when you get out the shower etc. lastly, the bed frame is a very odd shape and it is larger than the mattress, which lead to both my wife and I to hit our ankle bones on the frame multi times; and trust me it hurts! Other than that the room was lovely, and as it is a suite you get an extra room to relax in and watch TV. The huge shower was gorgeous and you got fresh towels and beach towels every day.    The grounds are delightful - 30 acres to wander around with a map and we did just that - looking at the various fruits and coffee trees. It is a very quiet area and an oasis from the busier towns nearby. There is a family room where you can hang out to make food, and there is cutlery and plates and a microwave. There is also a room where you can use a washing machine and dryer to wash your dirty clothes which was very helpful.    The staff are very helpful and they are on site from morning until 6pm. After that there is a phone number incase you have any issues.    The cons (and they aren't huge) are that the pool is not heated so it was freezing cold. I managed to get in it once, but apart from my wife, I didn't see anyone else brave it for the whole 4 days we were there! That was a real shame as the pool is gorgeous and a big draw to booking it.    I personally disliked the communal tables for breakfast and having to make small talk with other guests - it's just not something I personally want on holiday. However the breakfasts were amazing, but you don't get any input to what you are eating and one day I got an egg dish which I couldn't stand so went hungry that morning.    The parking on site is tight, so much so that one of the other guests managed to unfortunately reverse into our parked SUV one day trying to turn his large SUV round in the small space. That was an event we could have done without so be warned!    In spite of this slight issues, it really is the most delightful place to stay and I would go back in a heartbeat. Book it today - you won't regret it!",Jan 2019,January 2019,Traveled as a couple,,London
645445028,50,A truly magical place!,"I stumbled upon an online advertisement for Holualoa Inn whilst researching our trip to Kona, and was I so glad that we chose to stay here! We come from a beachside city, so I had no desire to stay in any of the big resorts on the Kohala Coast. Holualoa Inn is located up in the hillsides where the coffee plantations are.    Firstly it was like staying a friend's house - it was warm and comforting and delightful, wth every thought and whim catered for. We stayed at the Darrell Hill Cottage with our two children sleeping on the sofa bed. It is located a small distance from the main house (where breakfast is served), but we walked with no trouble (although it is an uphill climb!).    Pros:  (1) Beautiful charming place - you are free to hang out at the main house where there are two separate living areas, a kitchen to use, a swimming pool, a hot tub and laundry facilities. Coffee and tea facilities are always available and afternoon tea is provided. Beach supplies (everything you can think of - snorkelling gear, sunscreen, after-sun lotion, beach chairs, beach mats) are available to use.  (2) Stunning outlook to the ocean - you could spend all day in the cottage or main house enjoying the view  (3) Beautiful charming Holualoa Village - a nice respite from Kona bustle. It is full of art galleries and there is a street festival every first Friday of the month where the galleries open late and there are food stalls and live musicians performing. A total treat!    Cons:  (1) Communal dining table for breakfast - but an opportunity to meet other travellers if that's your thing  (2) Breakfast is pre-determined (with taking dietary restrictions into account) - so you can't choose your breakfast  (3) Our cottage was wonderfully private (as opposed to staying at the rooms in the main house) but it was close to the main road and we could hear the heavy traffic (which is infrequent)  (4) The Village is small- only a small dusty grocery store and one restaurant  (5) The Inn Staff are only on site until 6pm - there is an emergency number but it's not a hotel.    I listed the cons above so that you know what you get (as it is a pricey B&B). However it was truly special and I would definitely stay here again if we are back in Kona.",Jan 2019,January 2019,Traveled with family,,"Sydney, Australia"
643634994,50,Superior in Every Way,"We loved every minute at the Holualoa Inn and wished our one week stay could have been two! It’s really more of a boutique hotel than a B&B, because the quality and level of service was way beyond what a B&B offers. From making arrangements for manta ray diving, to arranging reservations at local restaurants, to a fully stocked beach gear cabaña, the proprietors and all staff were warm, welcoming, knowledgeable and committed to creating an elegant environment that was also truly homey.  And the breakfasts!! Best breakfasts we’ve ever had in any comparable setting and we’ve been to some mighty nice places in America, Europe and elsewhere. Was the artichoke and baked egg dish our favorite? Or the Apple/banana/coconut pancakes? Or the shakshuka? Or the French Toast? They all were. While I would have loved to sleep in a couple days, I wasn’t going to miss those meals and they got the day off to a great start. Every day at 4 PM, home baked goodies, iced tea or lemonade and fresh mixed nuts were offered.  I actually loved that the pool wasn’t heated, as it really cooled you off in the latter part of the day after hours of hiking, horseback riding or beach going. The setting was beautiful and removed. A nice little walk into town. We had no issues at all with noise from cows, chickens, roosters, or anyone else!  Yes it was expensive, but when you consider that a fantastic breakfast was included, parking was free, wi-fi was free, your beach towels were replenished every day and you never had to fight for a chaise at the pool, it was more than worth it.

The grounds and buildings were immaculate and very tastefully decorated. The breakfasts were fresh, hearty, wholesome, and delicious. But the thing that really stands out at the Holualoa, and grabs you by the lapels when you are there, is the spectacular, panoramic view! ""Breathtaking"" seems like an understatement. We stayed in the Ginger Room, with the garden view, to save a little money, but that didn't matter because that ocean view was right there everywhere else we went on the property. From the breakfast table, the gazebos, the pavilion, the nursery, all you have to do is point your eyes away from the mountains and there it is! One late afternoon, as we were sitting in recliners in the garden gazebo, there was a shower and we were treated to a stupendous sunset over the ocean on one side, and a gorgeous rainbow arch on the other. Heavenly! Just to add on, we also took advantage of the availability of the complimentary beach and snorkel equipment, and liked how the little town area is close, but not too close. One more thing--be sure to either download the pdf of the property map, or ask the staff for a copy. We really enjoyed exploring the 30 acres, checking out the nursery, and identifying the various plants--we found out that lifelong learning continues even when get to heaven!",Jan 2019,December 2018,Traveled as a couple,Ginger Room has the garden view but we spent most of our time in other areas of the property...,"Chula Vista, California"

The Inn is extremely elegant with plenty of places to lounge and nooks to sit and read or gaze down at the water.    There is incredible attention given to the guests in elegant surroundings. It is a ten minute drive to Kailua Kona, and an excellent departure point for points north (Waimea, Mauna Kea, Hilo) or south (Captain Cook, South Point, Volcano) as you don’t have to deal with traffic while trying to get out of town.

580498898,50,Beautiful But Pricey,"We reserved the Gardenia Suite at the Holualoa Inn for our last two nights on the Big Island of Hawaii. What a great way to end our stay!    The Gardenia Suite is on the top floor and consists of a lovely sitting room overlooking the ocean in the distance, and a spacious bedroom with two full closets. The bathroom is also quite large with a full vanity and walk-in shower. There is even a small balcony off the bedroom where you can sit and enjoy the gardens below.    The grounds are equally spectacular and include several gazebos, a hot tub, pool area (with an unheated pool), and beautiful gardens. The Inn is open air, so don’t be surprised to see little geckos scurrying about! On the main floor, there is a large, formal sitting area and a dining room, where breakfast is served. On the lower level, there is a large “family room” with a T.V. and assorted dvds. There are also a number of card and board games available to use. Off the “family room” is a small kitchenette with a sink, dishes, and full-sized refrigerator. Each room is assigned a shelf in the refrigerator, which works out fine.    Gorgeous wood floors extend throughout the Inn. Guests are asked to remove shoes, but only if they are comfortable doing so. Since we remove our shoes at our own home, we had no problem with this request.    Everything about this property is first class, and every room we had access to was beautifully furnished. Presumably, because we were on the top floor, we didn’t have any issues with the noise reported by other TripAdvisor travelers. The breakfasts were delicious and much of the menu consisted of produce found on the property. We also appreciated being able to borrow snorkel gear, beach chairs, and a beach umbrella for a day trip to the beach. However, I have to agree with some who have questioned the price of the rooms at this Inn. While the Gardenia Room was lovely and the service was very friendly, both my husband and I felt it was a bit over priced. The weather was suitable for sitting around the pool, but the pool was uncomfortably cool in the second week of May. We happened to have a generous gift card that brought the price down to a level that we felt was reasonable for the space and amenities provided. Without a similar discount, we probably would choose to book a room somewhere else.",May 2018,May 2018,Traveled as a couple,,"Arvada, Colorado"

More an elegant inn than your typical bed and breakfast, the main building is situated amidst a beautiful garden and coffee plantation in the hills above the bustling town of Kailua Kona.

559593432,30,"Beautiful Property, Not Worth the Price","This is a stunningly beautiful property, set into a hill overlooking Kona below; this and the high prices lead guests to expect a world-class experience, yet the experience falls far short of expectations. We chose this based on the raving TripAdvisor reviews, but we were surprised by what we experienced, so we felt compelled to write.    First, the pro's:  This is a working coffee farm; there are vegetable and flower gardens a few steps away, along with a chicken coop which provides fresh eggs for breakfast. The landscaping and gardens are spectacular; fragrant ginger lilies and other flowers are everywhere; the pool deck, lanai, balconies and other sitting areas are idyllic, and ""beautiful"" is not an adequate word to describe it. Flocks of saffron finches abound. The main house is open-air, so breezes blow through all day long. The house is furnished exquisitely. They play mellow Hawaiian music in the house, which adds to the relaxing atmosphere.    They have a terrific array of beach gear to use on your visit: beach towels, chairs, snorkel gear, etc. Free washer and dryer allow you to refresh your clothes if you're on a long trip.    The greeting when we arrived was friendly, but lacking in warmth. We got a great tour of the house and the amenities. This is a ""shoes off"" property. They do provide socks if you have cold feet. I felt like I spent a lot of time being mindful about leaving my shoes off at the front door when we returned to the property, not walking through the house with shoes, picking up my shoes and carrying them to my room, or carrying them from my room to the front door where I could put them on, etc.    The bedroom was beautifully furnished. The bed was very comfortable and the sheets were divine. The bathroom was a bit dated, but very nice. The bath products provided were not great and had unattractive fragrance.    Cons: The room lacked a safe, which surprised us, at $465 a night, and left us a little nervous as we did have passports and valuables with us. Also, this property was built as a private residence and is in serious need of sound-proofing. We were ok with the roosters and frogs singing during the night. We were not ok with hearing one of the guests above us snoring at 100 decibels all through the night. We were not ok with hearing other guests banging their suitcases on the floor above us, bumping down the stairs right next to our room or having loud conversations right outside our door. Other guests complained to each other about being awakened early in the morning for similar reasons.    At $465/night, we were surprised by the lack of service of the innkeepers. They leave at 5 pm, but they do leave a phone number for emergencies. This was still off-putting. We were never once asked ""how is everything?"" or ""is there anything we can do to make your stay more comfortable?"" Of course we are not shy about asking for anything we need, but it was odd to receive the vibe that the management was really not the least bit interested in us. We have traveled extensively around the world, and have stayed in all manner of luxury accommodations so we found this vibe strange.    The breakfast was mostly delicious, although they provide no choices. The lilikoi french toast is great. If you are not in the mood for the egg dishes they are serving (2/3 mornings we were there), your only other choice is fruit or toast. Some staff were friendly at breakfast; others were decidedly not.    When one of us asked for something different, the server became very flustered and offered toast, which took 20 minutes to arrive. Again, at this price, one expects a choice for a sit-down breakfast. The coffee was fabulous, by the way, but frequently ran out, requiring a 10 minute wait for more.    The seating arrangement at breakfast is odd; everyone is clumped around 2 large tables. It would be preferable to have smaller tables where you could be alone with your companion(s) if you wanted. I noticed that the hosts seated several strangers across from each other; it was strange watching other guests eating their breakfasts in uncomfortable silence across from one another. This created an uncomfortable feeling at breakfast. One of the servers just refused to make eye contact. Also weird.    There are only 4 parking spots; not enough for all the guests vehicles. They specifically tell you to not park in the circular driveway at the front of the house. However, there is nowhere else to park if the little parking lot fills up, if you return later in the evening.    Our room had a private hot tub outside. Unfortunately, it was so heavily chlorinated that it was toxic. We started coughing due to the chlorine fumes and had to exit immediately.The hot tub by the pool was good.    I would be ok with all of this if it cost $150-200/night. But at $465/night I expected more upscale service with more attention to the guests' comfort than what we got.

549196052,50,First Class,"Jennifer's review is spot on. Nestled on the hills above Kona, we believe this Inn is the best on the Island. It sits on 30 acres of land with its own native trees and coffee plants. We stayed for 5 nights at the cottage (Darrell Hill) which was well appointed, with a very comfortable bed and soft linen and a spectacular view of the valley below from the spacious porch. The main building, with its spectacular view of Kona and the ocean below, is kept spotless, a testament to the great staff. This is true from the person who takes care of our rooms to our breakfast cook (April). Speaking of April, the breakfasts and afternoon snacks she prepares are really superb.    The other plus to the Inn is that there is a great farm to table restaurant (Holuakoa Garden Cafe) just a short walk away.    If you are looking for a more personalized experience and big resorts are not your thing, try Holualoa Inn. You will not be disappointed!",Dec 2017,December 2017,Traveled as a couple,,"San Diego, California"

Cottage is great because you are detached and have your own kitchen and living area. However, being in the main house also offers the ability to take advantage of all the properties amenities a bit easier. Honestly, you can't go wrong either way.

The amenities were excellent with attractive rooms, roof top seating, a pool and common areas decorated with an Asian motif. The breakfasts were a treat.

470735231,50,A Slice of Paradise,"This is a special place intended for those who want to be off the beaten path, away from the crowds and who don't need a beach and a Mai Tai before they think they are on a holiday. Holualoa is a small village full of artists that is located above Kailua Kona at about the 1600 foot level. This is important to note because it changes two things that are otherwise normal for the western shore of the Big Island. First, at this altitude they get rain - so the land is lush. And at 1600 feet, the temperature and humidity are significantly reduced from that at sea level. Both are big pluses to me.    The Inn is located in what used to be a private residence done in a Balinese style. There are only six rooms in the main building - plus a cottage nearby. The place is gorgeous in a low key way. Very much like walking into a sumptuous private home. It is totally quiet and private - perfect for a honeymoon. When we were there, over half the guests were honeymooners - of the older variety. Holualoa Inn seems to appeal primarily to an older crowd, but I can't see why any romantic young couple wouldn't love it as well. There isn't a ""bad"" room in the place so don't worry about which one you get. They all have great views and cool breezes at night.    The Inn has very limited facilities. It's exactly what you would expect in a private home. There are beautiful gardens to walk through and a very nice pool with hot tub nearby. The most exciting thing to do on the property is watch the sunset from the pool terrace - which is stunning!!! A lovely small breakfast is served but there are no other meals and there is no bar or drink service. You are welcome, however, to do-it-yourself. Both meals and drinks. There is a fully equipped kitchen available to you and all of the necessities for proper wine or drinks service.    During the day, most guests are off the property at various activities which the Inn staff are expert at arranging for you. Most guests go to restaurants for dinner. As a result you see your fellow guests at breakfast and when they return from dinner but rarely between those times.    The village can be explored on foot from the Inn but everything else requires a vehicle.    We found the staff of the Inn to be terrific. Friendly, helpful, efficient, and professional. Unfortunately, they all go home at 6:00 so you are on your own in the evenings. Doesn't matter. It's part of the charm of the place.    My wife and I loved Holualoa Inn and will return. We met numerous other couples during our four day stay whose company we quite enjoyed. The most exciting thing that happened while we were there was my discovery of how to operate the computer controlled player piano so that we could have music during the evenings. That tells you a lot about the place. It was exactly what we wanted. If you want something low key, quiet and romantic, you'll love it too.    Highly recommended subject to the proviso that the nature of the Inn must be what you want. It's not like a small hotel. It's like coming to stay in a friend's home - perfect.",Mar 2017,February 2017,Traveled as a couple,All the rooms are very much alike with sunset ocean views.,"Toronto, Canada"

It was cool enough at night that the AC wasn't a huge issue but the room was too hot to be in during the day.

Beautiful pool and hot tub and a massage service is available on request. Very zen-like feel to the entire property which is just stunning. Free snorkeling and beach equipment for guests. The town is quaint with an artsy vibe. Our first night we walked to the nearby Holualoa Cafe and Gardens for dinner had a tremendous meal in a beautiful outdoor setting. Not for families with kids as I think there is a policy limiting to adult guests, but kids would probably be happier at a resort anyway. There is a grill available if you want to cook-in, changing rooms for the pool, and a large common room on the pool deck with kitchen facilities and a large TV.",Dec 2016,October 2016,Traveled as a couple,,"Endicott, New York"

We like that it was quiet and enjoyed the surroundings (the gardeners make an amazing job here !!!). We liked the fact that even if it was quiet it was not far from Kailuea. Their story is nice, it is nice to see that they grow their own coffee and macadamia nuts..    We went in an other big resort in big island and we don’t like them. We don't like big resorts and we mostly felt that they were a good alternative to them.    In the room they gave us some beach chairs and some towels, it was nice to have them for our trips on the island. We loved the sheets, they were wonderful.

The hot tub is worth a try and also sitting up in the top covered porch with a cup of coffee will make your day. The restaurant near by has good local organic food and there are art shops to visit. Tasty tacos near by as well. The furnishings at the end were very special. The staff at the inn pay attention to detail and you can tell.

424783958,50,Awesome Property,"We stayed six nights at the Holualoa Inn in Kona. We had decided to elope in Kona at this B&B. What a great decision - we were pleasantly pleased upon our arrival at the inn. It is such a wonderful property and inn. The view from the main house was spectacular not to mention the the lush beautiful grounds the B&B is set on. It is located on a 30 acre plantation that grows their own coffee, fruit, herbs, etc. The main house of the inn was decorated beautifully. The staff were all warm and friendly and very accommodating. The gourmet breakfasts each morning were awesome as well - most of the food grown on the property. The rooms were very comfortable and beautifully decorated - just as pictured on their website. Sunsets by the pool were the perfect end to wonderful days touring the island. Could not have picked a more beautiful spot to get married at. We have spectacular pictures of us on their grounds.    The only thing I could possibly say that was missing was AC. It was comfortable sleeping at night once it cooled down on the mountain, but rooms did get a bit hot during the afternoon sun and on the humid days. Other than that though, it was the perfect honeymoon/vacation spot. Would definitely go back there again - perhaps to celebrate our anniversaries :)",Oct 2016,September 2016,Traveled as a couple,There is not a bad room on this property - whether it be facing the beautiful gardens or the...,"Bridgewater, New Jersey"
419963784,50,"A beautiful inn; peaceful, blissed-out on return to Mainland","Holualoa Inn is for people who want peace and quiet, great views, great breakfast, lovely interiors, and quiet surroundings. Great for couples. 5-star service. We spent 6 nights here in March 2016 and the whole experience was memorable, restful, beautiful. Staff welcoming and lovely, and made it felt like our own home. We could not have chosen a better spot for our 30th anniversary celebration. This ranks as one of the best hotel experiences we've ever had. We have family and friends on other islands in Hawaii and have gone to most islands both as family and as tourists many times over the past 20 years or so. Been there, done most everything. We had not been to the Big Island in years and really wanted to go, but did not want to stay at any of the big resorts on Kona Coast. We are no strangers to self-imagined five-star resorts and so dearly wanted to get away from the clientele they attract -- namely hyped-up Type-A business people just like us from Southern California.  The Property. The inn is way up high on the mountain with a 180-degree view of the Pacific. The trip up the hill is just a few minutes so you can come and go without feeling you've wasted time going back and forth. You can see Kailua below, but you are too high for any noise to reach you. To put the location into perspective for SoCal residents, it's like being on Top of the World overlooking Laguna Beach. Or up in the Hollywood Hills. But there is no mistaking you are in Hawaii. Surrounded by Kona Coffee farms and awesome views.  There are only six guest rooms in main house. There were a couple of mid-week nights that we might have had only one or two other couples on the property. Absolutely perfect. The website pictures are accurate. See my pictures as well.  As compared to other bed and breakfast places in Hawaii, this is on the Inn end of the spectrum; it is not just some spare bed in someone's house. Bathrooms are en-suite; not shared. Furnishings are nice; sheets are really nice. You come and go as you like; staff makes breakfast, lovely afternoon snacks and then vacates late afternoon leaving the guests with the run of the place.  The house is a custom vacation home built for the family that published the Honolulu Advertiser. Decorated in Balinese antiques. Every surface is Koa or some other fine local hardwood. The wood floors are beautiful, and they keep it that way with a no shoes anywhere in the house rule. Which is appropriate for a Hawaiian home.  Common Areas. In the common areas, there is a garden-facing room filled with Balinese woodwork that gets the morning sun; they open the blinds and it was utterly perfect for late-morning coffee and some homework i had do to. The pool level has a common room with a TV and DVDs and a kitchen. There is a barbecue and during our stay other guests used it a few times. A supermarket is right down the hill, and we bought wine, cheese and snacks. We very easily could have grilled local fish or steaks and been completely happy. The Inn grows its own coffee and macadamia nuts. You have the run of the 30-acre farm. All kinds of other fruit trees grow on the site. Their orchid house is cool. There are many balconies decks to sit on, including one on the roof, there are gazebos and most of the rooms have ocean views. I had a work emergency one day and spent about six hours doing computer work in a gazebo with power and wifi. I had a 180-degree view of the Pacific while I worked. That's not what this place is about, but there was no escaping it. WiFi good everywhere i checked on the property.  Destination Weddings. Note that they have a beautiful wedding venue on the property, but that means they do host weddings and wedding parties from time to time. No doubt the property would make for a beautiful destination wedding. Ask when you book    The Surroundings.

The innkeepers were nice and gracious. We stayed in the Coffee Cherry Room and it was great for us and we enjoyed the private hot tub right outside our room.

This place had so much character, it was very quiet and relaxing, the views were unbelievable. The breakfasts were delicious. If there was only one bad thing it would be lack of AC. Maybe it was just our room. We had a fan, but it could only do so much. Or it could have been the timing of our trip. The was very minor though compared to how awesome the hotel was.

The house has several living areas both outside and inside. One night we were told there was one other couple (we never saw them) and on the other we were the only guests. Both the manager Paul and the chef were accommodating and helpful with suggestions for restaurants and sites. The breakfasts were delicious and artfully plated. The coffee, the eggs and most of the fruit came from the property. The garden and grounds are beautiful and worth a walk through. Our room was large and comfortable. Some might not like that the Inn is not on a beach, but we never tired looking at the views and watching the birds. Holualoa has some cute, interesting shops within walking distance of the Inn.

We stayed in two different rooms during our stay, plumeria and ibiscus, and both were great and with different advantages. Plumeria has a separate sitting area, remote from all the other room, it is close to parking, pool and community room. It is also dark which is good for sleeping late in the morning. Ibiscus, though smaller is very bright and comfotable. Close to other rooms and under a suite. Sound level depending on your neighbours but worth the magnificent view.  The house has plenty of sitting places where you can read, sip coffe or wine and enjoy your better half.  The pool is beautiful and very appealing even though it is not heated.

394891487,50,Amazing Time...Couldn't Have Been Better!,"I chose Holualoa Inn based on some research and the reviews here on TA. I couldn't have made a better choice for my wife's Hawaii 5-0 (50th birthday) vacation! The moment we arrived, we were greeted with leis, warm towels and tropical juice as we were given a tour of this unbelievably beautiful property. Lush grounds, warm and relaxing colors and all of this at 1500 feet up. The best part of this Inn is the Darrell Hill Cottage where we stayed. It's up a small hill away from the main property and secluded. It was our own place, comfortable, breezy (even with 85 degree temps) and spacious. A full kitchen, living room, bedroom with French doors that lead to a large outdoor deck, sitting room and bath with a large walk-in shower. The coqui frogs were a bit of a challenge but we were able to close things up at night to ward off their ""voices"". The property is truly amazing with pineapple growing right and coffee grown and served right here. Every morning, Crystal designed a delicious, fresh and healthy (even though I had to had some bacon!) breakfast every morning. The pool is beautiful even though we did not indulge. You can get a great view of the sunsets at night while enjoying the hot tub. There is a rooftop sitting area we discovered that gives you an even better view of Kona. A restaurant a couple of minutes away (see my review of the Holualoa Cafe) and a small gathering on the main road every first Friday. We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay for this trip.

The property is gorgeous and the common area was extremely enchanting. The cottage that we stayed in was incredible and completely stocked with everything we needed to shack up for two days. The Inn has a perfectly situated pool and jacuzzi overlooking fields, a vast ocean front and a very distant downtown Kona.

The property was astounding, and the fruit/coffee trees made the lush grounds a garden of Eden for our honeymoon. The staff--all of them--were very kind. They have thought of everything when it comes to what guests might need. And the breakfast, most of which grows right on the Inn grounds, is not to be missed. While most places, even those in exotic locations, might serve only as a bed to sleep on at night, my wife and I found the Inn to be a destination in its own right.

Wrap-around deck, lots of tropical foliage and rural Hawaiian feel. At altitude with soft winds it is always a perfect temperature. The main house and the cottage are decorated in Asian themes. Take off your shoes as you enter in Hawaiian fashion. The main house is gorgeous with wood floors and Asian themed artwork and statues. Breakfast is one of the ultimate treats. Fresh fruit from the gardens (mango, guava, papaya, banana, Hawaiian peach, star apple, etc.,) served on foliage. Each day a fully cooked for you when you arrive different breakfast. There is a swimming pool and hot tub – the pool is magnificent. The cottage is up the hill from the main house – a short walk under mango trees down to the main house. No road noise at the cottage. Nice walk through the coffee plantation with pomelos and macadamia nut trees. Easy walk (2 minutes) to Holualoa town with lots of galleries, a local store for all the necessities and a great restaurant. Beach chairs and beach towels provided. A 20-minute drive from Kona airport and 10 minute drive to the stores in Kaiula, the main town. Beaches on the Kohala coast (from Captain Cook to Spenser’s Beach) are all reachable by car within 40 minutes, the closest beach is under 15 minutes away. After a day at the beach or the lava fields, you will welcome the 1500’ elevation. Lots of activities in the area from lava fields, to national parks “refuge”, to manta ray swims to beach activities.

The breakfasts were delicious and the exceptional coffee is made from beans grown on the property. There is a downstairs ""rec room"" by the small pool, great for kids if you are traveling with them. There is also a hot tub. In addition, there is a small washer/dryer. The location is about 15 minutes to Kona and about 30 minutes to Kona airport. There are complimentary beach chairs, beach towels, snorkel gear and boogie boards for use during your stay.

On one hand I can only praise the Holualoa Inn and its staff and yet, on the other hand, I would selfishly like to keep this marvelous Inn a secret! ;) Nonetheless, my husband and I honeymooned at the Holualoa Inn a few years ago and absolutely fell in love, so for our ""babymoon"" we returned. It's such a peaceful and rejuvenating bed and breakfast. I can only echo all of the positive comments made by others. Returning to the Inn felt like returning home; not only are the house and grounds perfectly groomed and maintained, the staff is so positive and welcoming! We absolutely love them all! The Inn is nicely nestled up on the mountainside overlooking Kona, which for those looking to stay away from all of the touristy resorts, is ideal; yet, all of the Kona restaurants and markets and such are only about a 10-minute drive away. While we went on some sort of adventure every day (the volcano, snorkeling at a variety of beaches, stargazing at Mauna Kea, etc.), we almost always tried to get back to the Inn by late afternoon, to enjoy the delicious treats Crystal makes and the iced tea and coffee they put out every day. For those looking to truly relax, unwind, and enjoy the natural serenity of the Big Island, this is the best place to stay. My husband and I will absolutely return many times again, hopefully in the not-so-distant future once our baby is old enough to take a vacation to Grandma's. :)",Apr 2016,March 2016,Traveled as a couple,Not a bad room in the house!,"Chicago, Illinois"

As others mentioned, the breakfast is high quality...we especially loved the coffee that's grown right on their estate. The beds are extremely comfortable, and rest of the room is well-appointed. The views are amazing - we enjoyed sitting in the hot tub that overlooks the coastline. We also appreciated the beach equipment that's available for anyone to take with them for the day, as well as the daily replenishment of beach towels. The staff is friendly and helpful with great local recommendations for restaurants and activities. The only two things worth mentioning is that our room did not have air conditioning, and there was not a good cross-breeze, so it was a little bit warm when we were trying to fall asleep.

In an effort to be a little different, I'm going to mention some other details and just say that it is the little things that matter. They have thought of everything here! Our room came with a drying rack which makes it so much easier to dry wet bathing suits and such instead of having to figure out ways to do that. There is a washing machine, dryer and soap for guest use. There are umbrellas. Our room came with a hot tub exclusive for our use but that was outside our room accessible by a short path. The path would be a little rough on bare feet so they have 2 pairs of flip flops parked outside the door that leads to the hot tub. When we asked about bird books so that we could identify various birds that we were seeing around the grounds, it turned out the the book they had had sprouted legs and walked off. So they immediately replaced them. They inquire about food allergies so that they know if there is an issue that way. Anything that you ask about, they make an effort to accommodate you. It is just an awesome place. Would certainly plan to stay there again if we pass that way in the future.",Apr 2016,March 2016,,,"Manchester, Connecticut"

358732351,50,Amazing B&B!,"I am not usually a big fan of ""the traditional"" B&B's, as I tend to prefer more modern, boutique hotel properties, however the second I came accross Holualoa Inn I knew that we had to add it to our Big Island itinerary. Upon minutes of booking we received an email, and having put in our flight info, we were given details on how to find the property and how late ""check-in"" works.  The service on property was as wonderful as I anticipated given the ease of booking process. We got a quick tour of the beautify property the first morning after enjoying the most amazing, beautifully plated (added bonus when you work in the F&B industry!!) breakfast. And let's talk about the coffee for a second.......it is the stuff of a coffee lover's dreams. I think we bought most of their annual supply upon checkout but I am sure they may still have some left!!  We stayed in the Hibiscus room, and waking up to the amazing view after a late night arrival was the absolute best way to start our trip. Every detail and ammenity available was meticulously thought out. All of the staff were helpful and had great recommendations. My personal favorite suggestion was from Kat. She suggested dinner at the Holuakoa Gardens & Cafe. It was the best meal we had on the Island (other than breakfasts at the Inn of course)!!

352882237,50,Lovely place to stay with delicious breakfast,"We stayed here for four nights in the Gardenia Room and loved everything about it. Holualoa is a small enclave about 1000 feet about the Kona-Kailua area and thus away from the crowds. The views to the coast are thus magnificent. The inn itself was originally built as a private home, using clearly fine materials. The wood floors are stunning. Our room had it's own ocean view sitting area, so we stayed in the room a lot but there are many nooks and crannies throughout the property where you can sit and enjoy. There is also a guest kitchen if you want to prepare your own lunches and dinners - no oven but a grill (which we didn't use). The breakfasts were truly delicious. While they were not large (thankfully, from my perspective) they always featured a beautifully arranged fruit plate followed by a unique, exquisitely prepared entree: E.g., french toast filled with bananas or passion fruit with passion fruit syrup, roasted mac nuts, and cocounut. We also had some delightful egg dishes.

We stayed in Gardenia Suite, which has a sitting room in addition to a spacious comfortable bedroom. Furnishings in the room (and the rest of the inn) were top notch and our ocean view was superb. The inn has a vibe and a number of quiet areas that encourage one to sit and read, talk or contemplate. We'd heard about the fantastic breakfasts, but we were nonetheless impressed by the beauty of the presentations and the flavors -- most things we ate came from the Inn's garden/orchard, and the chef explained the ingredients when she served them.

344583680,40,Truly Beautiful,"We stayed in the Gardenia suite, which is really like a small apartment with a living room and access to the gazebo deck atop the inn. We were welcomed with a cool drink and a tour of the inn. Absolutely spectacular views of Kona and the sunset. Situated on the side of the mountain in a little sleepy town, you may drive by once or twice before you find it. Surrounded by beautiful plants and coffee trees and the occasional wandering cow from a neighbor's farm. The inn has beautiful Balinese decor and is finished in rich woods. It is quiet up here - little too quiet for me, but perfect if you are looking for some solitude. The town itself leaves little option for dining after 5, so you will have to make the trek to touristy Kona if you want to eat out, otherwise you have a beautiful grill and communal kitchen should you want to cook some of the lovely local meat and produce. Breakfast is provided and is a delicious selection with many fruits and eggs harvested on the property and they serve their own roast of coffee. The pool area is breathtaking. The pool has a gorgeous mosaic tile and views of the Pacific and sunset. While we were there it seemed no one took advantage of this and we felt we had the place to ourselves despite being fully booked. The service from the welcome staff, manager and owner was wonderful and helpful with a light touch. You can borrow snorkel equipment and other beach items if you are headed that way. I only wished for an option where you could purchase a simple packed lunch for the day from the kitchen to take out while exploring as there wasn't a little shop in town. Otherwise you have to truck it to the supermarket or Kona. The remote setting is a blessing and a setback if you want to venture off, but the inn is so beautiful you may just want to stay and soak up the view!",Feb 2016,November 2015,,,"Boston, Massachusetts"

339024633,50,The Gold Standard Bed & Breakfast,"I will forever be comparing bed and breakfasts to the Holualoa because it was so incredibly luxurious and comfortable. The attention to detail is what truly sets them apart. There are many examples - an extra blanket in the room and extras in the common areas for chilly nights, fuzzy socks and bathrobes in the room, earplugs in the nightstand in case the chirping coqui frogs keep you awake (I thought they were great white noise and they put me right to sleep!), snorkel and beach gear including sunscreen, towels, and beach mats, a washing machine and dryer, a shared kitchen with every cooking necessity. The list truly goes on.    What's remarkable about it is that you can tell the details were planned by people who love to travel and who also understand the importance of feeling at home away from home. That's really what they've accomplished.    We stayed at the Inn over New Year's, and booked the last available room -- the Orchid room. During booking, I was disappointed that it didn't have a private balcony and was nervous that it would feel small and cramped or not have a view. While it doesn't have a balcony, the view from the room is gorgeous -- overlooking Kona and the Pacific -- and the room is plenty spacious with a large bathroom. The best part, though, is the common areas at the inn are so inviting, and there are so many cozy nooks and crannies to explore that I didn't miss having a private balcony one bit.    The vibe here is very low-key -- all of the other guest were friendly and considerate. The inn-keepers are knowledgeable and welcoming but do not hover and lurk like they do at some b&bs. They struck the perfect balance of being warm and friendly while still respecting our privacy.    Last, and my favorite part, was the food. Every single day was the best breakfast I'd ever had...bested only by the following day. Lillikoi-stuffed french toast, homemade huevos rancheros, pineapple waffles...amazing! Every breakfast included fresh fruit and coffee right from the grounds. It doesn't get any more farm to table than that.    Thank you for making this such a wonderful experience.

337318370,50,Shhh-one of a kind place,"I almost hate to review our experience because it was so exceptional -- and I want to keep it as our little secret. Surfing Trip Advisor for unique places to stay on the Big Island ended up in my husband and I spending 7 memorable nights at this inn. From the moment we drove up (or down to be more precise) and Kat warmly met us at the entrance and we glimpsed inside the gorgeous home and furnishings, we knew this would be very, very special. We stayed in the Gardenia Suite and will definitely stay there again. The only negative was the ceiling light provided (with a combined fan) was so bright we never turned it on. There was just one floor lamp in the living area that didn't provide enough light to read after dark. The bedroom had two large closets, a comfy king size bed, lots of cross ventilation since it was a corner suite, Since we stayed in early December and the Inn is at 1400 ft, we had to close the windows at night and put on an extra blanket. Great sleeping, though.  The views, the breezes, the multiple places inside and outside on the property to relax, read, and walk, were just what we were looking for. The floors, furniture, and art pieces throughout the home were exquisite. The pool being unheated was too cool for us to enjoy. But it was pretty to look at and sit around enjoying the 180 degree view of the ocean and Kona down below. We barbecued one night in the Ohana kitchen/family room area on the lower level and ate under the gazebo as the sun went down. Oh, the breakfasts by Crystal were fabulous to look at and to eat: fresh, homemade ingredients that wowed us foodies. The couples we met were from all over the world. But we rarely saw them and only if we ate breakfast at the same time. We often felt we had the large, gorgeous house with few walls to ourselves. All the staff we met were so helpful and friendly. The coffee the plantation produces was so good we now order it directly.",Jan 2016,December 2015,Traveled as a couple,,"Seattle, Washington"
336329792,50,The cottage is exceptional,"This is a great place for some indulgence and tranquility. My thoughts on this are consistent with the majority of the reviews on this site.  I typically stay at resorts on the beach so this was a bit of a gamble but it was well worth it. You could sit and read by the pool with a few drinks without some kid bomb-diving nearby, and there was plenty of space on the estate for privacy.  The evenings were lovely - being up the hill is quite a bit cooler and there was always a lovely breeze through the cottage.  The breakfasts were great and it was a good chance to meet some of the other guests in a casual manner before going off and doing our own thing.  Like most places in Kona, if you're staying more than a night you really need a rental car.  Well worth it - I don't think you'll be disappointed.",Dec 2015,January 2016,Traveled as a couple,,"Melbourne, Australia"

Our Gardenia room is even more lovely than promised: So spacious yet so warmly furnished; huge bathroom with a luxurious walk-in shower; indulgent bed and bath linens & amenities; and that mesmerizing unobstructed view from the sitting room of Kona and the ocean. Impossibly, the public spaces are even more inviting --so open and yet so well decorated with plenty of indoor and outdoor places to sit, relax, linger, enjoy, … It was so much fun to be in the living room, dining room, and lanai on the ground floor during the day, to feel that liberating and heady breeze when all of the doors are flung wide open, and that indoor/outdoor boundary just disappears. In the evening, when those doors are closed, the spaces take on a warm glow, another invitation to slow down. Located along the so-called Kona coffee belt, the Inn itself is part of a functioning coffee estate with its own very lush garden; guests are invited to wander freely and learn about this aspect of the history of the Big Island. Despite having some work to do before our meeting, we found ourselves so happy to slow down and simply enjoy our time there.    Every detail of guest comfort has been attended to. Breakfast was a true experience of the senses --fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented, served with aromatic coffee from the estate; tea and sweets in the afternoon; macadamia nuts from the estate to nibble on all day. Although upmarket, the Inn does succeed in making guests feel very comfortable and at home, with their own refrigerator space, complimentary washer/dryer facilities, a grill for guests’ use, etc.    This was splurge for us, and it was completely worth it.

325687199,50,Wonderful Inn in the hills,"On our first trip to Hawaii we decided not to stay on the beach but in this excellent Inn. We were not disappointed. It is a fantastic Balinese style villa up in the foothills with the most wonderful views. It is like a tropical paradise. Our room was perfect and the wooden walls and floors were beautiful.  It is so relaxing with a great pool and hot tub in the grounds. It has a variety of facilities that mean that its easy to feel at home and a great place to chill if you are feeling tired and don't want to explore the Island all the time. It also has free really good quality wifi which is rare in the US.  It is also well located for getting around the Island with the Mamalahoha Hwy at the top of the drive which leads straight to the main highways to go either to the Volcanos, the beach or the North of the Island.  In comparison to the multi-national hotels in Kailua-Kona...well there is no comparison. This is much more of a unique experience and probably gives you a much better feel for Island life in Hawaii. At the top of the drive there are also a range of artisan shops which we found very interesting.  I take the point that another contributor made about tipping (and not just in the Inn). As a European, we all find the tipping policy in the US a very frustrating experience. I wish all service providers would just add it to the bill or make it truly optional!! I suggest a rewording of the bill.",Nov 2015,November 2015,Traveled as a couple,,"London, United Kingdom"
324467322,40,"Exquisite design and amazing views, with a couple of minuses","Major pluses: great views from the grounds and an upper-story gazebo (the website pics are accurate), very stylish furniture and decor in the common rooms, interesting short trails around the grounds, very peaceful environment, nice pool and hot tub.    Breakfasts were good but not as good as at a nearby B&B that was much less expensive. Concierge service was ok but we got better info elsewhere. Kat was very helpful on the phone but one of the other staff didn’t know when the local luaus were and told us several times at check-in that breakfast was from 7:30 to 4. (I guess he was just having a long day.)    Our group of 4 had two suites. Views from the Gardenia Suite were spectacular, and the two rooms were as beautiful as any we’ve ever stayed in. I can’t really recommend the Plumeria Suite, though, except possibly for a couple with a child. There’s a small extra room with a day bed, but there’s no real view from either room unless you're standing by the window, and no possibility for cross ventilation. Both rooms were hot and stuffy in the afternoon, and the fans didn’t help. At least the rooms cooled off at night. Unfortunately the alarm in one room kept going off at 6 am.    Finally, it was kind of a turn-off to see a suggested tip of 10-15% on the final bill for the rooms, which would have meant a $200-300 tip for two rooms for two days. That’s pretty excessive, given that you don’t get better service here than anywhere else we stayed. Management’s responses to other reviewers say that a recommendation is provided because travelers, particularly international travelers, have asked for one. Even if this is true it doesn’t justify portraying an exorbitant recommendation as “customary practice”. This is certainly not doing international travelers a favor; they’d be better off checking TripAdvisors’ “United States: Tipping & Etiquette” page. We’ve never seen a recommended tip on a hotel or B&B bill before, much less one for 10-15%, and it left us with a negative feeling toward the Inn.    Still, the pluses outweigh the negatives for the Holualoa Inn.",Nov 2015,October 2015,,,"Los Angeles, California"

When we returned, our Orchidroom was ready and we were showed around the hotel. The entire Inn is beautifully decorated and has incredible views over the coast and Kona.

Peaceful, romantic, tranquil (although the frogs make a lot of noise, but that is part of the tropical feeling).

Lots of nooks and sitting areas both inside and outside (including a covered rooftop balcony with lounge chairs). There is a pool and outdoor hot tub, as well as a communal guest kitchen with plenty of room for food prep and storage. Our favorite surprises were the details we didn't expect - a shed with free beach chairs and snorkel sets to borrow, complimentary laundry facilities, an afternoon snack with iced tea at 4pm, and homegrown Kona coffee available at all times. There's even a nice upright piano in the main sitting area and plenty of interesting coffee table books to peruse! AND THE BEDSHEETS - wow, they were the most luxurious and comfortable bedding we have EVER had in any hotel. The innkeeper gave us a brochure so we can buy some of these sheets for our own home.    No TVs in the rooms, which might not suit all travelers, but was perfect for us. We weren't bothered by the lack of air conditioning in the rooms - we kept all the windows open at night and found that we got quite a lot of air flow with the fans on, and with the screens we didn't have any problem with mosquitos.

Additionally, we found the manager became quite unwelcoming and unfriendly once we paid the invoice, giving us a hard time for asking them to hold our luggage for a few hours following check out.

This is coffee country - the increasingly reputable Kona Coffee district. Here you will find a true hidden gem. They call the Huloaloa Inn a B&B but that vastly underestimates this outstanding place. It is a 5 star hotel in everything but the name. The lodging is a grand house in the middle of a working coffee plantation - with beautifull grounds, a pool area and magnificent house.    First of all I challenge anyone to find a more beautifull setting on the Big Island. The views are breathtaking, and the house itself is a testament to good taste and immaculate upkeep. There are hawaiian and asian museum quality art objects spread throughout the gardens and house. The rooms are just like you would ask your interior decorator to make them. There is a attention to detail that you just cannot find in a large hotell. What you give up on consierge service and 24 hour room service you gain by being treated like royalty. There is nothing the excellent staff won't do or arrange from a yoga class on a roof top deck to sunset sailstrips.  But what takes this from excellent to outstanding is the food of the charming mrs Crystal Butari. Her breakfasts are a work of art. Fruits, vegetables, spices - juices and jams from the garden decorated with flowers from the orchard. The plantations own coffee. Local eggs in delicious omelettes. Best belgian wafles ever with her own home made mango syrup. This is world class. I would (and will again) travel the 30 hours from Europe just to experience her cooking. The only mystery is why some billionaire has not kidnapped her for himself. I certainly would if I could.  So just go.

The adults enjoyed socializing with each other. They didn't have to drop everything to go and supervise the girls. The grilling was done right where we could keep an eye on them as they swam. We all enjoyed the pool, cooking, TV, wifi, and the wonderful Jacuzzi with a view.    The setting was beautiful. It was so private, surrounded with lush, natural beauty. Of course the ocean view and sunsets were beautiful. Renting the whole house in a special environment was the best thing I did for my family because we were enjoying each other's company, helping each other and bonding. We stayed only 2 nights. The plan was to enjoy the home and all that it had to offer so we did not go anywhere. Just had a relaxing, rest and recuperation vacation.    Kathryn and the other assistants while ""invisible"" were there when we needed them. This is what made it so comfortable and really helped us to feel as if it was our home.

I fell in love with the inn on line and and it exceeded all expectations. The inn was busy with other guests that we would see at breakfast but most of the time we felt we had this elegant, inviting house all to ourselves. There are so many lovely private areas. The decor was just what I wanted - zen soothing, polynesian, so inviting and gorgeous. The surrounding scenery and gardens are superlative. So much so that in the evenings we usually brought back some wonderful, just caught fish and grilled our dinner pool side. No other restaurant could provide better views or ambience. The kitchen available for guests use has everything you need and like the rest of this amazing house it is inviting and beautifully decorated. The staff is helpful, friendly and gracious. Ask a question and if they don't know they find out and follow it up with a print out. They assisted our daughters in pulling off an anniversary surprise. The girls said they were so friendly and helpful. I am not sure I have felt this way before about a vacation but I am honestly feeling a little homesick for this fabulous, unique inn.

We booked the Gardenia Suite and highly recommend it for the amazing views. We have stayed in 5 B&Bs on the big island and this one had one of the nicest interior and exterior with dramatic views and flora. It also seemed to be less personal with a larger staff and guests did not interact as much, which is not a complaint.    Pros:  - Finer details: bedding was luxurious; welcome to room with snacks including coconut macaroons, hand crafted soap, fresh squeezed lilokoi juice for breakfast, windows provided great lightning and open up with pleasant breezes creating indoor/outdoor spaces  - Enjoyed the decor and common spaces to relax, including a fire place and full kitchen for guests.  - Landscaping was done well creating privacy and displayed exotic flowers  - Enjoyed the seemingly tropical noises outside of frogs, and even the chickens, but ear plugs are available in room just in case guests do not  - Location is nice being close to town and the town of Holualoa had nice galleries to visit up the street.  - Nice facilities for laundry, kitchen and outdoor grill    Cons:  - Walls in suite were a little thin as our neighbor came to us and knocked several times to warn us they can hear ""everything"".

We flew over to the Big Island for a 5 day getaway from our own rental business in Maui. When you drive up you are greeted with cool towels, a refreshing drink and a little tour of the grounds, common area and your room-such a personal touch! Every morning there is French Press Kona (100%-they grow AND roast their own!) Breakfasts are 5 star, starting with a beautiful fruit plate(grown on property also!) there are snacks in the afternoon after you return from activities which they will arrange as well as restaurant reservations. There are panoramic views of Kona/ocean and a beautiful pool from our room and common areas. Fireplace at nite, very secluded and quiet-like a rainforest and since it's located on a mountain slope, cooler temps than Kona below. The room had all the amenities, immaculately clean, and comfortable linens on the bed which when you plopped down after a long day of exploring you felt amazingly content to nap :)  We will definitely come back again-we highly recommend Holualoa Inn!!",Mar 2015,March 2015,,,"Lahaina, Hawaii"

My girlfriend and I had the opportunity to stay at the Holualoa Inn for 2 nights after having spent 5 at the Fairmont earlier in the week. This was exactly what we needed and wanted...relation to the fullest, attention to all the finer details, and stay that was truly heavenly.    My expectations were somewhat high given the rave reviews - amazingly enough, you can't really put into words or pictures what this place offers until you stay. Not only did it meet my expectations, it far exceeded them. Here are a few of the amazing things I can share:    The staff - wow wow wow! Crystal, Lindsay and all others went out of their way to make us feel at home and at peace which is often difficult for me coming from the city life of DC. Pleasant, courteous, and helpful, the staff makes this place 5 stars for sure.    Stayed in the Coffee Cherry Room - gorgeous room, very private with uber comfortable bed and sheets!    Breakfast - give it up to Crystal for wowing us each morning with her delightful breakfast...gormet with every bite. And don't forget the coffee - all day every day, this stuff is as good as it gets, fresh from the property.    The atmosphere - zen like. Escape with the charm, beauty, and magic of the Inn. Every nook, chair, spot, is another place to unwind and enjoy the splendor of the Inn and the Big Island.    The view - so pretty, so serene, we actually cancelled our dinner plans the first night, picked up a pizza and ate watching the sunset from the Inn. Extraordinary!

It was well appointed had a full kitchen, living room, bedroom, changing room and bathroom. Not to be forgotten a most wonderful lanai that we enjoyed sitting on morning, noon and night.  Each morning we would walk to the main house for an amazing breakfast. The staff is so lovely, inviting, kind and helpful. The experience was extraordinary and the location is lovely up in the hills. The little town is just right outside the driveway so you can walk to many gifts shops, art galleries and a lovely restaurant. We rarely return to hotels, only because we want to travel to new places, but we plan to return here! It was almost like being in your own home away from home with the most lovely people imaginable to ensure your stay is perfect.    Other features: Pool with amazing view, Hot Tub, a community room, in main house- pool level, that you can make dinner at, watch movies etc. (Nice gathering area if you come as a group.)

Other reviews have described the staff and the facilities and they're spot on. This oasis is a place of peace and solace and a fantastic beginning and ending point for your day. One could spend all day here and soak in the ambiance, or use it as a base for touring this magnificent paradise. We did the latter and found it to be centrally located yet away from the noise and bustle of most vacation retreats.  The day starts with a delicious cup of Kona coffee and an amazing breakfast that will carry you easily through midday. The staffers rotate so you get to meet many new faces. Lori and Lindsay and Steve were terrific. Off you go to start your day and you return to the calm peaceful hideaway where snacks and iced tea await you. There is a pool a jacuzzi a barbecue area and many trails to tour the beautiful foliage. There are many places to sit and rest or reflect.  The rooms are fantastic. From the decor to the immense bathroom it continues the feel of the Inn as a retreat. The bed is comfortable and the sheets are like none other. Our room, hibiscus had two easy chairs in front of s picture window with an amazing view of Kona and the ocean beyond.  Overall we highly recommend this Inn as a fantastic compliment to your Hawaii vacation. One would have to look really deeply to find a thing wrong with this spot.

We stayed one night in the Gardenia Suite and I can honestly say one night isn't enough. The room was very spacious and so incredibly comfortable. The sheets on the bed...OMG! We had to purchase some before leaving. The breakfast was amazing along with the coffee...we bought heaps of that too to take home with us. Kat and the crew were very kind to let us check in early so we could start preparing for the wedding that evening and were extremely helpful with all the preparations up to and during our time at Holualoa Inn. The Inn is located at high elevation so it stays cool and is located in the small village of Holualoa. If we could have moved in...we would. If you stay here, do yourself a favour and spend a day just at the Inn. I wish we could have stayed longer and just enjoyed the peace and zen likeness of the surroundings.

237041780,50,Beautiful Experience,"I usually don't write up places I stay at because I'm not a big fan of free advertising. I did make an exception this time for the Hulualoa Inn. The reason is simple - it was probably one of the nicest places I have ever stayed.    The location is great in that it is at a higher elevation (over 1000 feet) so it is much cooler than down by the beach. You get a nice breeze during the day, which is what makes Hawaii ... Hawaii.    Not too far from Kona, it takes about twenty minutes to get to from the airport. The drive is via a winding road that goes up the hill. Once you turn off the road and are on the property, it is like you are in another world.    The house is beautifully designed, furnished, and maintained. Lots of wood throughout. We stayed in the Gardenia Suite - second floor. It has a sitting room, bedroom, and bathroom. All rooms were beautifully designed and furnished. You will want for nothing. The sitting room has a 180 view of the ocean and adjacent property. The Inn is set on 33 acres, so you won't have any neighbors other than the other guests (there are five rooms total). You are surrounded by coffee bushes and macadamia nut trees. Keep in mind that if you want to fully enjoy the climate/surroundings/location, you will want to keep the windows open. There are screens to keep the bugs out, but you can be seen by guests at times. Be careful what you wear (or don't wear, I guess).    The Inn has a pool and hot tub that my wife and I used and enjoyed. The place is neat as a pin and everything works.    Breakfast was cooked for us by Crystal each morning and they were works of art. If you have any special diet needs (my wife is vegetarian), no problem. They certainly will not suffer. All the ingredients were local and fresh. Kona coffee available all day long if you want. We bought two pounds that were picked off the grounds then roasted (off location) that week, so it is as fresh as could be. Price was reasonable - no gouging like some places might.    Overall, although it is not cheap, I felt I got my money's worth. Although the Inn itself was wonderful, what really made it great was the staff. They were just genuinely NICE. You won't get that from a corporate location.    In closing, if you are looking for a place to stay on the Big Island, I would highly recommend the Hulualoa Inn. All positives and no negatives - a honeymooner's dream location. My sincere thanks to all the staff - especially Joachim. Wish we had a chance to talk more football/soccer.

This was the third visit for me and for my mother, and the first visit for the other 6 members of our family; we enjoyed 4 of the rooms for 9 nights.    Each morning's breakfast started the day on the right note. From the amazing fruit plates to the wonderful main course (stuffed passion fruit waffles, anyone?) to bottomless Kona coffee from the Inn's plantation - what a better way to start the day? Many thanks to Braline for making Mickey Mouse pancakes for the youngest member of our party! She felt incredibly special. :)    We were able to utilize the snorkeling/beach equipment graciously provided - this made a huge difference when we went down to the beach (including Two Steps).    We also availed ourselves of the common areas - the guest laundry was a life-saver, and the kitchen/grill area was wonderful. I can't imagine a better stocked guest kitchen; we enjoyed a number of family meals there.    From the gardens to the pool to the hot tub to the player piano in the indoor family room, the Inn is the height of graciousness, comfort, and home.    All of the staff made us feel incredibly welcomed, and were great at calming fears when Hurricane Iselle threatened the Island.

I rated sleep quality a little lower as the first night I was woken by roosters at 2am, however, was fairly warned about this possibility on check in and then afterwards made use of the earplugs that were provided. Roosters are everywhere in Hawaii so this wasn't really an exception on our holiday.    The cooler weather in Holualoa was a lovely relief from the baking heat down on the coast.

Supposedly it was a family home before it was purchased by an antiques dealer who turned it into an inn.  - great views up and down the coach, see the sunset etc. You can spend all day just hanging out and enjoying yourself here.  - beautiful rooms with sitting areas in addition to the bed space, large bathrooms  - very quiet  - outdoor swimming pool (unheated), heated outdoor hot tub with views  - gardens and various places to stroll and sit outdoors  - downstairs ""family room"" with TV, movies, kitchen etc. You can buy groceries and/or wine/beer & leave your items downstairs  - rooftop covered sitting area with views  - good breakfasts  - walking distance uphill to the local restaurant for lunch/dinner  - only downsides: it's not directly on the beach and it takes ~10 min to drive downhill for shopping, dining etc.    Bottom line I'd stay here again for a very nice, special event vacation.",May 2014,March 2014,Traveled as a couple,,
204905898,50,Best B&B yet.,"Pictures and reviews online cannot prepare you for the actual thing. Celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary called for a special place: and we found it! Upon arriving you are greeted by a cool beverage, a hug , and breath taking scenery. The entire house is open with cross breezes possibly making air condition unnecessary. The decor appears to be straight out of magazine , but everything is encouraged to be used and lived in. The inn has 6 rooms, each with private baths. Depending on the location of the room, your views varies from looking over Kona to viewing the gorgeous gardens every morning when you wake up. One room even had a private hot tub - although you do have to go out side and up a short path to get to it. The Inn has everything you would need to make your visit as complete as you would like it . They supply snorkel gear, boogie boards, beach chairs, mats for your attempts to find a sandy beach. If you want to eat out every meal - they have many recommendations and directions typed out that you just take a copy and go. If the high cost of dining has shocked you in the islands - you have a full kitchen and grill at your disposal for dinning in . Laundry facilities present also . A beautiful pool- although as mentioned in other reviews, not heated. The Inn is located higher in elevation than expected thus always approximately 10 -15 degrees cooler than at sea level. Not quite sure if the pool water ever gets enough direct sunlight to heat up. Would recommend this B&B very highly. I might be spoiled now.....  A few negatives- snack at 4 pm needs to be heavier. 2 cookies does not quite sustain grown men until dinner. Also need to find those wild turkeys that gobble outside of your window at 5 am.

Now the syllables flow fondly from my lips like clear water flowing over smooth stones in a gentle brook. I'm waxing poetic, aren't I. That's the Holaloa Inn effect. The decor of the place is beautiful and elegant, yet relaxed. The rooms are spacious and clean. The view from 1400 feet looking down to the Kona harbor is fantastic. And breakfast is to die for.....delicious and artfully presented. But the heart and soul of this jewel of a B&B is the staff. Crystal, Kat, Steve, Carole, Braylene, Lindsay and Anita......wonderful souls each and every one. In my eight days there on a house-hunting trip, everyone was helpful and kind. And it wasn't simply that they went above and beyond expectations on helpfulness, but that they acted in the authentic aloha spirit.  The Holualoa Inn is the antithesis of big resort hotels. It's very small, very quiet, and very peaceful. Amenities include a hot tub with the view of Kona (which I used almost every morning at dawn), a pool, laundry facilities, and an Ohana (family) room equipped with TV and fridge. Each afternoon, iced tea and some snacks were set out for the guests and remained out until morning, just in case of late night snack attacks. There is a cabana set up for couples massage. The staff will arrange for a masseuse to come to you if you want a massage.  The drive into town was short. My sister and I enjoyed Jackie Reyes and Sam Chow's. We also had a handful of fine meals at the Gardens, a short walk away from the Inn.  I was in the Hibiscus Room and my sister was in the Ginger Room upstairs. My only complaint about the room was that there was another guest room above me, and even barefooted, it seemed that the upstairs guests tread heavily on the floor a couple of nights.  I heard coqui frogs calling in the evening, but the sound didn't bother me. Being a country girl, I rather liked the frog calls. And the Inn routinely has coqui round ups to minimize the noise level of calling amphibians.  Wild chickens are an island fixture and roosters do crow in the pre-dawn hours. Again, the sound was distant and didn't interfere with my sleep.  My sister was mosquito bitten during our trip. Most of her bites were sustained during evening outdoor dining away from the Inn. Bring your repellent if you're a mosquito magnet.  In conclusion, the Holualoa Inn and the people associated with it occupy a fond place in my heart. I highly recommend it.

It sits high on a hill overlooking all of Kona and from our room (Hibiscus) we could see the ocean and all the twinkling lights below. We didn't want to leave there. Every room you are in has beautiful artifacts from the owners' trips abroad with welcoming sitting areas that just beckon you.  I can't say enough about the welcoming staff. Crystal is the dearest woman who makes  you feel very much at home and makes the most amazing breakfasts. The kitchen is her  metier and you can see how she loves to cater and prepare her works of art.  Cat with her infectious enthusiasm, Anita and Steve, all ensure that guests are completely taken care of. There is a very zen atmosphere to the place which Crystal keeps pointing out, ""this is all for you"" and by the second day when I was somewhat over being awe-struck by the surroundings, I believed it, and even did all our end of trip laundry in the tidy well equipped room near the pool.  A great restaurant (Holualoa Garden Cafe) is within walking distance, craft shops and galleries as well.  An early morning snorkeling trip to the magical bay at Capt Cook is a short ride and kayak paddle away.  If you go to the Big Island, this is truly a unique and peaceful place to stay. It is also very convenient to the airport, so it's not a trek to get to the Inn from there.

We knew we didn't want to stay at a big resort, and we also knew we didn't want to stay anywhere where there would be children around. The Holualoa Inn was just the ticket. We found it suggested in a travel book and made our reservation solely based off of the travel book's recommendation. Upon arrival at the inn, we were greeted with a cool towel and a glass of (freshly squeezed) mango juice to refresh ourselves after our long flight.    The inn is absolutely stunning. From the open-air, open-concept floor plan, to the comfortable, modernized, and eco-friendly rooms, to the perfectly manicured grounds that are full of many varieties of lush tropical plants for you to explore and enjoy. The view of the ocean and Kona is panoramic with a gorgeous sunset ever night, guaranteed.    The innkeepers are the most sincerely friendly people I have ever met. They are always ready to help you plan your adventure for the day if you'd like a little ""local advice"", or give you gardening tips on how to keep your orchids looking spectacular just like all of theirs; however, they never impose on your private time. The breakfasts were out-of-this-world. Crystal is a fabulous chef and an extraordinarily kind and gracious lady. She made us something different every day and each meal she prepared was absolutely delicious. And the picnic lunches she packed were also very tasty, filling, and nutritious!    We could not have asked for a more perfect honeymoon! We sincerely did not want to leave at the end of our stay and when we go back, I am certain that we'll stay at the Holualoa Inn.

So we pretty much had the house to ourselves- we enjoyed sunsets at the pool, lounged in the common room, and used the fridge and guest kitchen to prepare our meals. What a treat.    Now to the most important part...the food. All I can say is wow. We had the most delicious breakfasts each morning with fresh fruit from the gardens and food prepared to our liking. This was probably the best food we had our entire 2 weeks in Hawaii. We always looked forward to snack time at 4:00 when they would put out fresh baked goods and juice.

I was impressed by the grounds as we arrived and the common areas of the Inn were lovely. The room we stayed in was clean and the sheets were divine, but it was average otherwise. The breakfast in the morning was delicious and the staff did a nice job welcoming everyone and making introductions. In our room, I could easily hear neighbors moving around their room, but I felt that was to be expected. I did not expect however, to hear roosters at 4:30 a.m. There were ear plugs in the bathroom but it had not occurred to me they were there for a good reason. Another guest commented on the roosters as well, so it wasn't just a bad dream. My greatest disappointment was at checkout when I was asked if I had completed the Invoice left in our room. I hadn't, so I went back to the room to get it and was horrified to see suggested gratuity amounts of 10, 15 or 20%. At $400/night, our minimum suggested tip was $80--up to $160. Really? I am a good tipper, but we were there for 2 nights and had 2 meals there. We parked our own car and carried our own bags, so I felt the suggested amounts were not reasonable and the way it was handled made me terribly uncomfortable; and I didn't appreciate feeling that way on vacation. There were a few other pros and cons, but all-in-all reflecting on our time there, it felt like staying with a wealthy family member--the thing you have to decide is if you want to spend your vacation with your family, or if you go on vacation to get away from them. :-)",Mar 2013,February 2013,Traveled as a couple,,"Syracuse, New York"

We were greeted with such warm and genuine aloha from the staff. The inn and grounds are beautiful and very well maintained. Your every wish thought of ahead of time. You can have a massage in open air gazebo, grab a couple of boogie boards and beach towels and head of to the beach, relax by the pool, or stroll in the gardens.    We stayed in the beautiful Gardenia Room, with it's gorgeous views of the Kona coastline. The decorations are unique; you know are in a tropical paradise. The room was very clean and comfortable. The breakfasts were delicious, we couldn't get enough of the Kona coffee, grown right on the inn grounds. We loved it so much we order it online to have at home, and are reminded of our special time at the Holualoa Inn every time we brew a cup!

My wife and I came here on the end of our 2 week Hawaii trip and stayed for 3 nights in the Coffee Cherry Room. From the moment we waled in, to the time we left, we were treated with love, respect and like family. The staff at the Inn were some of the nicest people we have ever met, and really took good care of us and other guests. In addition to soaking up the amazing views, you will soak in the most amazing coffee and delicious breakfasts, which are always a surprise and a gastronomical journey your tastebuds are going to love. Some of the things we loved while at the Inn were the awesome grill, where you can buy yummy local fish and grill fro dinner. Watching the sunset and the amazing snacks and desserts that are made available to all guests.

145405386,50,Amazing in every respect!,"In our planning and communications months before our trip we felt that Holualoa Inn had to be special and we couldn't wait to see if our feelings and research were on track. We were celebrating our anniversary and both of our birthdays, so we searched high and low to find the ""right"" place and did we ever!!!  From the moment we turned off into the driveway and meandered our way through the gorgeous grounds of this coffee estate we thought we had arrived at our ""home away from home"". That was indeed confirmed when we were greeted some warmly and cheerfully through the kitchen window by Cat. We once again knew that Holualoa Inn was beyond special and amazing.  The grounds and home are unbelieveable--every detail, every decision has been thought of and you do truly feel that you are staying with special friends in their home.  We hesitate to use the term ""staff"" because everyone who works at Holualoa Inn must have been chosen so carefully not only for their fabulous skills and personalities, but it's so very evident that this amazing group of people have created a culture of cooperation and family within their environment and with each other. They are so special that I called the week of our return home to share with Cat how much they all made our trip and to let them know that we missed them all.  Thank you so much Cat, Steve, Crystal, and so many more who made our stay at Holualoa Inn one of the highlights of our 3 week trip to the Hawaiian islands.  Crystal's gourmet breakfasts were not only outstanding, but beautiful as well. It's difficult to say which was the best since we loved all of them.  When you go (not if) know that you will be taken care of in every single way--directions, recommendations, reservations, wonderful snacks and beverages, a fridge and washer/dryer for guests to name a few.  Holualoa Inn is located in the small arts village of Holualoa with fabulous views of the Kona coast below--a great location out of the huba buba of Kona, but a reasonable ride to shops and restaurants. We will say that probably the best place we ate during our 5 night stay was within walking distance of the inn--so island casual and such good food with fresh local ingredients that we ate there 3 times.  As you can tell we loved Holualoa and the wonderful ""staff"" and it will be a very special memory for us and hope we will return ""home"" in the future.",Nov 2012,September 2012,Traveled as a couple,We had a chance to take a look at all the rooms and each was special.

143950447,50,Wonderful stay and great location!,"This inn was one of the highlights of our wonderful trip to Hawaii. We spent 3 nights here as we explored the Kailua-Kona area. The inn is on a coffee farm with plenty of fruit trees and beautiful walking paths. You also have a tremendous view of the coast below. The inn itself is gorgeous and feels like a home away from home. We stayed in the Plumeria Suite and it was wonderful! The bed is very comfortable and the bedroom makes you fell very relaxed. The sitting area provides a good view of the grounds and is a great place to read a book. Even the bathroom was great! The staff was very attentive during our stay and always took time to check in on us. One of the evenings we took a long tour to Mauna Kea for the sunset and stargazing. When we came back, we discovered that the staff had taken the effort to put the evening snack on our nightstands. It was the little touches like this that set this inn apart from any other place that we had stayed previously. The location is perfect for activities down in Kailua-Kona. We did two snorkeling tours and the Mauna Kea tour and we were only a 15 minute drive from the various departure and pick up points. Since the inn is at a higher elevation than the coast, you get relief from the sometimes hot and humid temperatures. At night you do hear the Coqui Frogs but they aren't overwhelming like elsewhere on the island. The inn does provide complimentary earplugs if the sounds of nature are too much for light sleepers. We also took full advantage of the complimentary laundry services that they provide. It allowed us to pack lighter than what we normally would have done. The morning breakfast service was great and we had the opportunity to try fresh fruit that was picked fresh from their grounds. We highly recommend this inn for anyone staying on the Kona coast.",Oct 2012,October 2012,Traveled as a couple,,

The property and the grounds are gorgeous and the view is one of the best from all of our stops along our trip. The house sits high above the Kona coast and is right in the middle of the coffee plantation 'highway' so it was a perfect location for not only peaceful views, but convenient to our coffee touring. I loved the special touches like the way the room was prepared for us with giant leaves, flowers and local Hawaiian sayings on the nightstand. Breakfast was amazing, with juices and fruits and other items grown right on the property. Irina was so very helpful to us in making dinner reservations, and we so enjoyed the Lilikoi juice we asked for extra!!

138785293,50,This is a world-class destination,"The category of ""B&B"" for this hotel is a bit misleading. The hotel is so special that it belongs in a category of its own. We have stayed in high end luxury resorts in places like Tahiti, Seychelle Islands, Bali, etc., and found the overall experience of the Holualoa Inn to be as special. The price is high, but worth it. It's like arriving at a multi-millionaire's private home and being welcomed as a special guest.    We spent a total of 7 nights, in two of the six rooms. They are all beautiful, but different, so it's hard to recommend one over another. The staff are all so wonderful that I don't want to mention any one by name, for fear of leaving someone out.    Although there is no dining room on the property, there is an excellent restaurant that is a 5 minute walk away (I think it is called Halualoa Cafe). We ate at about 10 different top end restaurants on the Island and thought that the one in Halualoa was actually the best of them all.    In terms of ""practicality,"" first time visitors to the Big Island should know that the most beautiful beaches and hikes and sites are spread out all over the island. In other words, you need a car to see this island. We used the Halualoa Inn as our base, and went off every day after breakfast to explore the island, returning to the tranquility of Halualoa for dinner and the evening. We would have done the same thing if we had been staying at the Four Seasons or the Mauna Kea.    One recommendation: by all means rent a 4 wheel drive car! The most beautiful beaches on the island are not accessible to 2 WD cars. These beautiful beaches are usually not marked with signs on the road, and can only be identified as ""take the dirt path on the left between mile marker 90 and 91 on the highway"". The best way to find them is to buy a copy of the Big Island Revealed guide book. (The hotel has a copy.) In accordance with local custom, I will refrain from identifying the most beautiful beaches, as we want to keep them secret!    We will definitely return to the Halualoa Inn.",Aug 2012,August 2012,Traveled as a couple,,"Paris, France"
136375907,40,Great b&b,"Holualoa Inn was our first base after arriving in the Hawaiian islands from the UK, and it was a great place to wind down.    The B&B is beautiful and immaculately maintained. The rooms are not air-conditioned so we had to keep the windows open at night, but the property is about 1500 feet above sea level so it never felt too hot and there was a great breeze through our room (Orchid). We thought the noise from the tree frogs would be a problem - it was extremely loud all night - but we actually found it quite soothing and enjoyed the ""back to nature"" experience. The only problem was that, whilst the window nets kept out the mosquitoes, a few midges still managed to get through and we found ourselves keeping the lights very low when we came back to the room at night in order not to attract them. We still ended up with a few bites though!    The pool is spotless and attractive but can best be described as invigorating. It's unheated and was absolutely freezing! To be fair, the B&B warned us about this before we arrived (but not before we booked!).    As other reviewers have said, the breakfasts were delicious - nicely presented and very varied. The Kona coffee was amazing and the fruit (mostly home grown) was served perfectly ripe. The ""treats"" and juices that we left out each afternoon were another nice touch, not to mention the macadamia nuts, which we loved.    The common areas were superb, and there were so many places to ""hide away"". Everything has been thought of, even down to a laundry room. We just wish we had been able to stay longer - there is so much to see on the island, we didn't really get chance to enjoy all the facilities.    The staff were great. They couldn't have been more helpful, and were really good at recommending drives, beaches, restaurants etc. If anything, they were almost too attentive. Our tour of the property when we arrived took 45 minutes and we found the service a little too personal in some ways (as perhaps evidenced by the style of some of the management responses to each review) but we still loved it.    There was one uncomfortable aspect of our stay however which has resulted in our downgrading from 5 to 4 stars, and that relates to the request on the final bill for a tip. Coming from the UK, the American approach to tipping is alien to us, but we have been to the States on enough occasions to understand the approach and, wherever we travel, we always research tipping etiquette in advance and tip at the appropriate levels.    We had seen one or two earlier negative reviews on TA about the tipping policy at Holualoa but were still a little surprised to find a note at the bottom of our bill saying something along the lines of ""many of our guests ask us about tipping, this is what you might like to tip at 10%, 15% and 20%."" The 20% suggestion amounted to $200 for a 3 night stay which, quite frankly, we found insulting. At the end of the day this is an already expensive b&b with just a handful of staff, it is not a 5 star hotel, and to even receive a suggestion that we pay $200 was, in our view, quite insulting. We stayed at several similar b&bs whilst in the Hawaii islands and none of the others took this approach. We therefore felt very uncomfortable when settling our bill and, in fact, left a much lower tip than would otherwise have been the case. It has left us with a slightly negative memory of this otherwise excellent property and we really hope that this comment may encourage the b&b to re-think their policy on this.    Tipping issues aside, we would have no hesitation whatsoever in returning to Holualoa.",Aug 2012,July 2012,Traveled as a couple,"Our room, Orchid, was at the end of a corridor and we found it to be very quiet.",Billericay

The king size bed was one of the most comfortable we've ever slept in. This room offered a lot of privacy because no other sleeping rooms are near it, but is probably not the best for someone who likes to sleep late, because the dining area is directly above it and folks walking around up there can get a bit noisy. Brian's breakfasts are unique, interesting, and tasty...we're still dreaming of his lilikoi (passion fruit) syrup...soooooo GOOD! To call this a B&B isn't fair, because the grounds and rooms are so expansive and offer more privacy than I've ever experienced at a B&B.

It is richly furnished with lovely wooden antiques, paintings and statues. It has quite a few common areas - the foyer, the living room, a rooftop look out, and downstairs by the outdoor pool is a recreational room if you want to do some cooking (including a bbq), watch a movie or play boardgames.

I know, I know, it sounds corny, but I have to say it: It's a piece of paradise.    This Inn is situated on a fruit plantation. When you exit off the main road and drive through the plantation, the scenery is so lavish and plush with foliage that it feels like you have warped to a different time. My son's exact words as we were driving through the oasis: “Mommy, I’m scared. Where did we go? “ We had never seen anything so beautiful. Arriving at the Inn, or better described as ‘the house that Zen built’, I knew that we would now be forever spoiled.    The rooms are spa like and immaculate – high end, but not arrogant.

Although recent reviews had been flattering, we were a bit apprehensive that the Inn would be as wonderful as we had remembered. Our fears were unfounded as the Inn still has that special Polynesian ambiance of an old Hawaiian plantation. The owner, Cassandra Kazen, has maintained the special Hawaiian environment and has updated with impeccable furnishings and décor. Also, she continues to enhance the grounds and gardens, creating a wonderful environment for strolling through the property viewing the tropical plants, fruit trees and coffee plants.

Mine have been as simple as a picnic under the stars and as exotic as a night alone in an elegant, Balinese-inspired house. I experienced both at Holualoa. I rarely post reviews but I had a night there that I'll never forget.    It started when I slipped off my shoes before walking through the main rooms. Brian greeted me with a glass of fresh guava juice from the property (the inn rambles over several acres of fruit trees and a growing coffee farm). Brian also charms your time there with homemade treats like fresh avocado bread, stuffed french toast and a sunrise of fresh fruit in the morning.    Cat walked me through the house, where the flow of one room to another, joined together by long floors of eucalyptus, feels like a Balinese version of a fairy-tale castle -- every fairy-tale should have a freshwater swimming pool, a sumptuous bed and breakfast made as you wake up, shouldn't it?    There are several nooks and remote perches to sit and take in the property and the view, and I spent my night there visiting all of them. It turned out I was the only one at the inn that night, except for a couple I met briefly late in the evening.    I picked up fresh fish nearby and cooked it on a grill and kitchen available to guests; there are many small touches like this that make the inn feel like a home instead of another place to stay. In the middle of the night, I lay out on the roof and counted the stars while listening to the ocean.

We could not have imagined that the house could have been so beautiful and well-maintained. The pictures do not do it justice.    But more than that, the people of Holualoa Inn - Chris, Catherine, Brian and, most especially, Noe - went out of their way time and time again to make sure we were well-cared for.    Staying at Holualoa Inn felt like the ultimate in luxury without ever stepping over the line to invasiveness, intrusiveness or being over the top.    Our room was lovely with an insanely comfy bed and a great shower. We had endless supplies of beach towels, PM snacks and anything we needed at any time.    Did we bring jackets for the summit of Mauna Kea? No - but Noe and Chris lent us theirs. Our plane didn't leave until 730 pm, and Noe made sure we had use of the late departure room so we didn't lose a minute of our last day in paradise.    Laundry on the premises, tons of private indoor and outdoor space and the amazing food - sumptious breakfasts that leave you stuffed and delectable afternoon cookies - made this Inn a highlight of our stay.

This B&B seems to depend on tips - to this end, your bill at the end even includes your, ahem, ""expected"" contribution to the staff's salaries. Nothing illegal or immoral with this, but you should know this upfront, so that you are not surprised on the last day and blow your budget. Feel free to ignore the pressure to tip. Sorry to be such a Debby Downer, but one other issue about Holualoa Inn puzzles me. Why are so many of their reviews written by people with only 1-2 TOTAL reviews on TripAdvisor? Really?

117812930,50,The all encompassing spirit of “Aloha”,"Aloha! So here you are looking for your “home away from home” in Hawaii. You need to look no further. Seriously, if you book anywhere else you will not find the level of beauty, comfort, genuine care, and the all encompassing spirit of “Aloha” that you are seeking! We stayed at the Holualoa Inn for 14 memorable nights and it has everything…and if something is missing you just have to ask, something that is insisted upon by the staff!!    OUR ROOM: We stayed in the Gardenia Suite. We toured all the rooms throughout our visit, and for us the suite was the way to go. We personally enjoy the extra space. The sitting room of the Gardenia overlooks the lush property that Holualoa is nestled on, as well as stunning views of the Kona Coast (sunsets included!). Our room also overlooked the swimming pool. Before you wrinkle your nose at this fact, let me reassure you that this is not your typical resort pool area. It is quiet and serene and adds nothing more than just another element of beauty… that is if you can take your eyes off the vast views just beyond it. Also, our suite (as well as Ginger Room) are on the top floor and just a few paces to the “Rooftop Gazebo”. No matter what room you stay in please plan to go up at least one night to watch a sunset from this area, you will not regret it! Every sunset is unique and will surely awe and inspire you. This is also a great place to enjoy a cup of coffee on an early morning as the sun comes up.    OTHER BEDROOMS: All the rooms are very well appointed and equal in beauty and comfort to the bedroom in our suite. We just personally prefer the extra space. There is one other suite (Plumeria), this is located on the ground floor by the pool. Everyone’s tastes are different, so keep in mind that this suite is the only accommodation with a television in it if that is something you want (or in our case didn’t want). Keep in mind also that there is one other television and DVD player on the property for all guests. It is located in the Ohana Room (Family Room), also located on the ground floor by the pool.    CHEF BRIAN: When you have the opportunity to sit down to one of Brian’s breakfast creations please take a moment to really look at what is set before you and one more moment to express gratitude to Brian. Brian is not only a great cook, but an artist with heart. The care and pride he takes in his culinary creations really makes each morning a special event! Every plate he set before us was as beautiful as it was tasty. And “Oh My” was it tasty!! I have many food allergies and I can tell you also that Brian is a genuinely caring person with a truly kind spirit, as he took my allergies seriously and reassured me of his vigilance. It is quite difficult for me to trust anyone with my food. I have been given the wrong foods by even some very well meaning people and have had to deal with the allergic reactions as a result. With Brian, I had no worries. He actively made sure that everything I ate was “safe”. This was not limited to the breakfast either. Brian also made sure that I had afternoon goodies to enjoy!    KAT: During our stay Kat made sure we had everything we needed. She is yet another person here at Holualoa with a genuine good spirit that makes you feel truly relaxed and cared for. Never did we feel that our requests were too big or too small, and throughout our stay she continually insisted that we let her know if we needed anything to make our stay better or more comfortable. She even reassured us that we should call after hours if need be. We opted to cook our dinners in the well appointed Ohana Room Kitchen, but Kat will direct you to the best restaurants in the area if you need some suggestions. Beyond her job, Kat is just one of those people you are glad you met in the world.    MASSAGE outside in the Hale Luana: BOOK AT LEAST ONE…DO IT NOW! :)    We could go on and on, but you will just have to experience the rest for yourself. Because of the beautiful property and ALL the beautiful people we met at Holualoa Inn we had the vacation of our dreams. We hope the same for you and yours. If you still decide to stay at another hotel while in Hawaii, at very least take a drive up to Holualoa Inn and ask for a tour…if you are lucky, there may still be time to transfer over for a few days of your vacation!!

The Inn is gorgeous, beautifully decorated, spectacular grounds, etc. If you love fresh fruits and vegetables, there were plenty to be had fro breakfast as well as for snacking.  There was a fresh bowl of fruit out every day--white pineapple (much sweeter than the gold), papayas, liliko'i (passion fruit) avocados, etc..and there were containers of dried fruit and nuts for snacking at anytime. And then there were the cookies.....:-)  The breakfasts were nothing short of MAGNIFICENT!! Brian clearly loves to cook, and he loves to cook for people who love to eat (my family!). His Hawaiian waffles are a ""must have""....and we left the Inn every morning after a wonderful breakfast of fresh fruit and Brian's ""creation of the day""! We could have skipped lunch (but did not!) with such a wonderful breakfast.  The Inn has a beautiful pool and is on the Kona mountains overlooking the ocean 1400 feet below. If you want a tranquil getaway, just grab a bottle of wine, sit on the deck and watch  the world below you while sipping your wine. The rooftop deck is also wonderful in the evenings, sitting and listening to the singing frogs!  If you go to the beach, the Inn provides snorkel gear, boogie boards and towels (and driving directions). if you want to do any of the Island tours, Kat will arrange it for you and give you directions. If you want to take a picnic lunch with you, or have a special dinner made, Brian will do that also (extra cost). We did the picnic lunch and it was absolutely gourmet!!!  The entire family (six of us) talked about Brian, Kat and the Holualoa Inn feeling of ""ohana""  for the rest of our trip. We wished we could have stayed there our entire trip. Expensive, but worth every penny and not a care in the world once you arrive. We felt like we truly were family after having been there just a few days!

Learn from my mistake...take your flashlight (which the Inn provides you) if you'll be walking back after dark :-)    Heading to the beach for the day? The Inn will loan you everything you need. We borrowed a boogie board, snorkel gear and even an ice chest and beach chairs.    Feel like cooking your own dinner? They have an entire kitchen as well as an outdoor grill that is available for the guests to use.    Chef Brian is not only a very good cook, he's a master host. We've all had that awkward B&B experience of gathering around the breakfast table with strangers. But Brian has a way of putting everyone at ease and keeps the conversation flowing effortlessly.    Ok, so there is one small teeny tiny thing I didn't like: the roosters. Apparently, the sun doesn't even have to be up for roosters to start crowing.

101179873,50,It's the best. Part II,"This was our second visit to the Holualoa Inn on the Big Island of Hawaii, and it was marvelous. It was amazing that the inn could surpass our first visit (a year ago), but it managed to be even more inviting. The breakfasts by Chef Brian and the other staff members (Noe, Carole, Kat, Chris) were simply superb: Kona coffee and fresh fruit from the farm on the property was the first course, followed by a hot breakfast both unique to the isle and scrumptuous. If you have allergies or special needs for meals, the cook was ready to meet your needs. And there was always an afternoon snack of cookies or shortbread and homemade teas and juices. And there were macadamia nuts for cracking and fresh fruit for juicing on your own. Plenty of 100 percent Kona coffee and tea were available at all hours; there is a guest kitchen and a barbecue for your own meals. Books to read; art to peruse; naps to be taken.    The grounds of the inn are beautiful, as is the lovely home full of hardwoods, antiques and art. It becomes your home on the island; you feel the stress melt away as soon as you kick off your shoes and walk into the lovely lanai leading into the inn. There is a rooftop crow's nest and two gazebos, a laybrinth to walk away the stress, and a bounty of landscapes setting off the beauty of the Kona coast. You're a short walk from the little galleries and shops that make up Holualoa village; fine, friendly people who take time to talk to you and share your outlooks.    Evenings are cool at the 1,300-foot level of the inn (or thereabouts), and the days are warm. Beware: The pool is cold but refreshing. We often sat in rocking chairs on the back lanai balcony, reading books and taking photos of gorgeous sunsets as a few calves bawled on the farm below and a few birds chirped with delight. There are robes and booties if you're cold in the early morning; there are ear plugs if you don't want to hear the neighbor's roosters. Soap is handmade; rooms are delightfully appointed with great views of the vast Pacific.    As an added bonus, the three other couples who shared the inn during our stay were friendly and we have some stimulating converations at breakfast. But with so much to do on the island and with such beautiful grounds and rooms to wander, we always had our privacy when we wanted it and often enjoyed the entire home to ourselves.

100753633,50,Well Kept Secret,"What can we say that hasn't already been said? Holouloa Inn exceeded our expectations. While the website's video is well done, one has to have first hand experience to fully appreciate this treasure.    We are not fans of bed and breakfasts so we like to call it an inn. The level of privacy, the chef's resources and skills as well as the well appointed surroundings bring this place up a notch. Staff was present when needed but manages to play a behind the scenes role. We even received a typed note on letter head slipped under our door in the middle of the night during tsunami warnings.    One drawback for some may be the location. There is only one restaurant in close proximity (1/4 mile) but it's one of the best on the island-Holuakoa. Other options are at least a 5 mile drive which may seem long if you've been driving a lot. We didn't mind. The secluded location of the inn was a priority. In fact, we had a busy day of driving and hiking our last day so stopped and bought a Costco chicken and bottle of wine on our way home and dined in the Holualoa Inn gazebo watching yet another magnificent sunset.    Our favorite time was getting up before breakfast (it's served from 7:30-9:00) and going to the lanai to read while drinking some of the best coffee in the world that's been set out ahead of time. An unexpected bonus was meeting some lovely guests from all over the world. It's a great way to pick up island tips.    We haven't even mentioned the food! Let's just say, it has to be experienced. We don't normally have big breakfasts, but Brian's cooking was so amazing we couldn't resist. It was filling enough to sustain us all day but we never felt stuffed.

Would have been happy to stay longer and would certainally do so on a return visit.  This would not be a place for children or singles. Great for couples.

96930767,40,A lovely honeymoon,"Holualoa Inn is a charming and unique place to stay. It may have been a slightly unusual pick for honeymooners, but it suited us well. We left early everyday to explore the island--there's an incredible amount to see and do in Hawaii! -- but had we been the kind of honeymooners who want to lounge by a pool most of the day it would have been awkward. It really feels like you're staying at someones house-- it's quiet but not especially private. The staff is so few so they do know your business -which is helpful- but can be a bit less romantic than a resort where you have the abandon allowed ny anonymity! That said, the staff at the in are super helpful, sweet, and cheerful and will really do their best to make you comfortable.  The Inn itself is beautiful, full of lovely wood and gorgeous windows. THE VIEWS! Oh my. Really special.  The rooms are pretty, clean, and comfy. We arrived on a day when there were no other guests so we got a tour of all the rooms by chef Brian. If you have kids you want Plumeria (the room with the Tv) it's separated a bit from the other rooms. If you want privacy I'd go for orchid or gardenia. We stayed in hibiscus which was lovely but we felt like we were right over the pool. The hot tub room seemed (cherry?) seemed nice but kinda sits at the entrance so not hugely private. The room above that felt really stuffy (no breeze the way it's facing, maybe?). During this tour Brian did a great job explaining everything to us and told us about a ""hospitality room"" that they have for late travelers. It's essentially a bathroom to keep your stuff in and shower if you have to check out like 8 hours before your flight. It's first come first serve and since we were first there he guaranteed us the room. (the day we checked out we heard him give the room away to new guests without even consulting the ""list""- um, stoner moment?) it was annoying but not the end of the world, we had a car trunk afterall. Chef Brian more than made up for this flakiness by making the worlds best breakfasts everyday. My gosh fresh food is good, and he is talented and cooks great things with the great produce. The breakfasts were a highlight for sure!  Other amenities: the pool, the cold, cold pool! We bravely got in one afternoon but only for 15 minutes. I recommend leaving the Inn after your marvelous breakfast and finding a beach. The pool ain't worth writing home about.  The driveway needs some lights but just bring a flashlight! They should provide flashlights with the rooms, but there's only one in the guest kitchen and we were told it doesn't work. Luckily we brought our own-- and could go to late dinners across the street from the Inn without worry.  Last thing, the tipping is really confusing and I still feel guilty and weird and slightly creeped out by it all. If I could do it over again I would give one lump sum in cash at the end of the stay. We didn't understand the tipping situation up front tho so we were tipping for food service and housekeeping daily. At the end we wanted to give Kat our concierge a tip but the bill only had sharing options in amounts that seemed too high (especially since we'd already been tipping) so we just got flustered and didn't give anymore. . . But, I mean. It's really not a clear system!  Just be aware of the little things before you go -- it really is a fantastic and magical little part of the world and I'd go back in a heart beat!",Feb 2011,December 2010,,,"Brooklyn, NY"

Not only did we hold our rehearsal dinner at the Inn but my bridesmaids and I had a spa day poolside as well with Mani/Pedis and massages! That evening we stayed up in the gardenia suite with panoramic views of Kona. Absolutely spectacular. It was just a perfect evening as we were able to sip champagne, tell stories by the fireplace on my last night as a ""single"" woman.

The grounds are beautiful, sporting coffee and fruit trees and numerous flowering plants and offering numerous places for guests to relax apart from other guests. Afternoon tea and lemonade are best enjoyed while viewing the sunset from the back of the house, overlooking Kailua-Kona.

I stay at B&B’s whenever possible, some quirky, some quaint, some trying so hard to “be all of that” and I actually enjoy most of them despite even some awkward moments.  This is simply the best B&B in which I have ever stayed and they don’t need me to write about it to make it better; it is what it is.    Few homes are built as well as the Holualoa Inn or as beautiful with attention to detail (I’m a builder) in construction from the copper roof, eucalyptus flooring bamboo matted ceilings and the overall décor.  The view however can’t be built by the Inn and a view this beautiful and grand in scale would be worth the clamor if the house was a shanty. Service was impeccable and I really, really do mean that. Noe was as gracious as the home was beautiful.  I only wish we would have stayed the whole trip there.

Aside from that the most magnificent experience. The views from the Inn are unrivaled; the wooden furnishings beautiful; and the fresh fruits from the garden at breakfast and the design of the building to accentuate the flow of fresh air was amazing.

The Comphy sheets on the bed were so nice, we ordered a set as soon as we arrived home.  We usually leave the Inn to 'explore' around the island but this time we were so comfortable, we stayed at the Inn all day , finding a new place to read and relax each day, and only left to go out for meals. Speaking of meals, the breakfasts prepared by Brian and Noe were truly works of art and delicious besides! Visiting with other guests at breakfast and in the Ohana room was also a special part of our visit.

82971629,50,The best breakfast and view of HI rainforest after the beach!,"This bed and breakfast provided a wonderful view and was very relaxing. The frogs do sing at night, but it only adds to the charm of the rainforest scenery. Breakfast is excellent and can be brown bagged, if you have an early trip. Fresh fruits, juices, syrups, jams and eggs await you in the morning! The staff is great about accommodating every need! The grounds are very quiet with multiple places to relax and read or just enjoy the view. The beds are very comfortable and have sturdy pillows, not like the hotel pillows that sink when you lay your head down. Be prepared for the change in altitude when going in between the city of Kona and the inn (about a 1000 foot drop). The pool provides a great place to relax while your body adjusts to the altitude, if you are not used to it.

If you want a relaxing retreat for you and your family with all the hospitality you can handle, this place is PERFECT. From the moment we drove on the property it was apparent that the team of caring people that keep the inn at Holualoa pay close attention to details. We received a hawaiin greeting by name before we even made it to the door.    Staying at Holualoa in is an experience whether you are out for adventure or want to lounge around all day. They have it all. I'm not sure how the staff does it, but they make you feel like you are the only guest there. They cater to your every need without being intrusive. For instance, my wife and I visited on our wedding anniversary on a reunion after a military deployment. I mentioned that I had learned to play the guitar while I was away, but my wife hadn't heard me play. Well, the innkeeper that day went home and brought her guitar back just so I could show my wife my new skills. Now that is Accommodating! Awesome!    The breakfast is gourmet to put it mildly. I went to bed wondering what the chef was going to cook up the next day. The snacks in the afternoon are perfect for when you come back to the inn before going out for dinner. Most of what you eat was grown on the property. How amazing is that!?    I was totally floored by this place and so was my wife. We will be back, maybe every anniversary. Guys, if you want to earn some major points bring your woman here. Trust me. She will be enthralled with the decor, the food, the ambiance. They have it all.

77988790,50,Thank you Holualoa Inn,"Thank You Holualoa Inn    Six months ago my wife and I were woken at 5:00 a.m. up by a call from the front desk of our hotel in Kona. They told us that a tsunami was on its way and the hotel was being evacuated. Buses would be leaving within the hour.    We chose to find our own way and left in our car in the early morning just as the warning sirens started to wail. It was a very stressful time. Even locals were leaving the lowlands and the highways were busy. Roads leading to the water were blocked by the police and we drove steadily up into the highlands.    All we wanted was a safe place to wait out the surge expected from the tsunami. We didn't know the area so we just kept driving ""up."" Eventually, we arrive in coffee country more than 1400 feet above sea level and found the Holualoa Inn. It was still only 7:30 or so and as we drove onto the grounds the Inn seemed very quiet. A few roosters were strutting around but there were no cars in front of the main building and the only resident we could find was a large statue of the Buddha presiding over an empty lobby.    We tentatively used the lobby phone to call the caretaker and find out if there was room available. We were afraid he might be annoyed at being woken up so early but he answered the phone cheerfully after only a few rings and when we explained that we were looking for shelter from the tsunami he said while the Inn was officially closed for a few days if we didn’t mind waiting for the staff to arrive he could have them come in to open it up. Check in time usually happened in the afternoon but apparently, while we were the first couple to arrive he’d had a lot of calls from displaced people the Inn was going to open up so people would have a place to stay.    The first of the staff arrived within 15 minutes. From the start they were gracious and enthusiastic. We had woken them up on what was probably their day off, when the Inn was closed, and they apologized for not having everything 100% perfect. It didn’t take them long to correct the last few details. We checked in within the hour and just as we were about to have a nap they announced that they had called in their chef to make breakfast for us and the rest of the people who had drifted in ahead of the tsunami.    It was one of the most delicious meals we have had for a long time. One of the best parts was eating local fruit and drinking coffee grown on the plantation. The other was the setting. The interior of the Inn and the furnishings are just beautiful and looking out the window we could see down the mountain to the ocean we had fled from a few hours before.    We watched the tsunami coverage on CNN downstairs at the Inn. The waves never threatened Kona and even though we had pre-paid at our old hotel we chose to stay at the Inn that night anyways. It was one our favourite parts of our trip to Hawaii. The staff were full of advice about what to do and where to eat in the area and they went out of their way to make us feel comfortable. One of the often repeated phrases was ""make yourself comfortable. This is your home while your with us."" It definitely felt like that except at home we don't have people baking us delicious snacks in the afternoon because they have the spare time or bringing orchids to put in our rooms.    We have stayed at a lot of hotels and B&Bs in a number of different countries and we have never encountered such a perfect combination of charming staff, beautiful surroundings and comfort. We would definitely recommend the Holualoa Inn to anyone. It is a beautiful place and the staff are wonderful. They will always embody the true “Aloha spirit” of Hawaii for us.

67923444,50,Heaven on Earth,"I had visited the town of Holualoa five years ago with a few friends who are locals. We went to a gallery for dinner. From the moment I saw the town, I knew that I had to go back and stay for a few days. Normally, my family and I stay at the Four Seasons Hualalai, but the town of Holualoa seemed to offer a more authentic Hawaiian experience.    After doing some research, I decided to book a room for three nights at the Holualoa Inn. I was doing this trip solo, and with breakfast included and a small, home-like atmosphere, I felt confident that I would not get lost in the shuttle. From the moment I arrived at the Inn, I was completely impressed! Tucked away off the main street, it is one of the most beautiful homes/Inns that I have ever visited. The Inn itself is perched on the mountainside, with spectacular vistas of Kona and the coastline below. The architecture of the home offers indoor/outdoor living, with warm natural woods, large windows (beautiful stained glass windows as well), tons of little spots to sneak away and just relax in lounge chairs or rocking chairs, and lush, tropical gardens surrounding the living areas. Everything is decorated with the best in taste, offering a completely first-class yet cozy respite from the typical Hawaii tourist spots.    The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, and from the moment I arrived, they made me feel right at home. Teas, beverages, fresh macadamia nuts, and home-made baked treats waited in the dining room (daily). Every detail was planned for in the rooms: bathrobes, slippers, ear plugs -- just in case the local roosters wander near the home in the morning - wonderfully soft towels, and THE most comfortable beds with feather duvets, etc. That first night I slept so well, that I hated to get out of bed, but knowing that breakfast was waiting, I managed!    Breakfast is served in the dining room. Chef Brian (I hope I am spelling his name right) greeted me and explained his creation for the day. He told me that there are 33 acres of land at the Inn, and that they try to grow as much of the fruit and food served at the inn on the property. They have hens that lay eggs daily and they also grow their own coffee! Needless to say, the food was ABSOLUTELY delicious!!! And so healthy. Each morning guests raved about the feast, and I found myself lingering at the table longer and longer, soaking in the views and the company. It felt like home.    Both Kona and the airport are much closer than you would imagine, and I actually found it a pleasure to return to the inn after spending the day down at the ocean.    Noe and Kat were fabulous, as well -- offering local tips, directions, help in arranging reservations, etc. After staying for 3 nights, I actually ended up booking 4 more and staying for the week!! I have to say that it was one of the most relaxing, magical, and restorative weeks I have had in years. I have traveled all over the world and stayed at some of the finest hotels, and I have to tell you that this is my absolute favorite place of all! I literally thought about it repeatedly upon returning home, and I cannot wait to return again.    As for room recommendations: they are all very nice, but I would request Hibiscus or the Gardenia Suite, because they offer beautiful vistas. I also stayed in the Coffee Cherry room on the other side of the Inn, with a private hot tub -- views of the gardens -- it was nice being on the main floor, and I loved the privacy and tucked in feeling of the room -- with your own private entrance, it was just very tranquil.",Jun 2010,April 2010,Traveled solo,,"Incline Village, Nevada"

Our room was spacious (bigger than it looks on the site!) with a beautiful view. Details like the iPod dock, free wi-fi, and make-up towels were all much appreciated.  The only thing that I did not love is the use of some kind of fabric softener on the sheets - I am really sensitive to odors and prefer a dry-feeling cotton to the softener, waxy feel. I have no doubt though that I had known they used it before I went and requested scent-free sheets, it would have happened. The staff was really great.  All of the equipment we borrowed was in top shape - beach towels, beach umbrellas, boogie boards, coolers, etc. How nice it was to not stay at a resort and be charged $22 for parking, and $12 for snorkel gear and $10 for towels.

The Inn is nestled on a foothill of a volcano in the TINY town of Holualoa. As you turn down a long driveway, you are surrounded by jungle plants, trees, and flowers. You may see a wild turkey and many exotic birds. The inn is off the road and cut off by their acres of land from any other buildings or roads. The inn is open and inviting, as are many Hawaiian buildings, the walls slide open at many parts creating na amazing outdoor feeling anywhere you are. The dark luxurious wood and amazing decor give the inn a rich, relaxing feel. Being on a hill, the inn is in a cloud forest. It keeps the temprature down compared to the coast, not cold, but you will never have a sweaty uncomfortable sleep! Its wonderful! Do not be detered by the term ""cloud forest"", it is not always cloudy! Each morning was bright and sunny, weather in Hawaii changes fast no matter where you are, it can rain one minute and blow away the next. It mostly rained at night during our stay, and was never a bother at all. SInce the inn is on the hill, you have a wonderful view of Kona and the big wide ocean. Many rooms have this view as well, and your breakfast table. The rooms are large, bathrooms are big and roomy. The bed was so comfortable, room was very very clean, the ceiling fan created a nice breezy room. The inn is wonderful for many reasons other then its beauty, no need to pack beach towels or go rent snorkel gear, they provide you with them! We used beach towels almost every day and fresh new ones were put in our room each time. The washer and dryer are awesome as well, we were able to pack light and do some laundry at the inn. You will find that the staff will usually change you clothes over for you:). The staff is the most freindliest group of people you could meet. Chef Brian greeted us at the entrance of the Inn, where he had us remove our shoes, a wonderful inn ""rule"". He gave us a grand tour and explained all the perks and happenings at the inn. Every morning he serves you a plate of various fruits grown on their property, anything from strwberry papaya to yogurt with banana jam. Then your second course of more delicious food mostly grown on the inns land, eggs from thier chickens, herbs from thier gardens, avacado from their trees, etc. The food was delicious, stuffed avacado, coconut pineapple waffles, omlets with quacamole, sausage, cheese, asparagus, etc. Gets your day started right! You can even have Brian make you a romantic meal anywhere on the property (there are many goazebo/a rooftop lookout/poolside spots). For a little extra he packs you lunch too! Noalani and her small staff of kind people are so helpful and sweet. They will give advice and recomendations with honesty. Noalani even french braided my hair for snorkeling! They will make reservations for you and call any place to ask questions you may have, even set up a massage in their private gazebo for you. They are amazing, there are only a handful of staff there at any given time, not crowded, and they are all gone by aroun 6 so you have the inn to yourselves. There was only one other couple staying during our time there, and Thursday we were alone! There are only 6 rooms at the inn so it will never feel too crowded even at full capacity. We had an amazing secluded honeymoon and couldnt asked for more! There is an avacado tree that drops avacados all day, we picked one up and made quacamole one night in the downstairs full kitchen/living room that is open to you whenever you like, opens straight to the goreous pool. Its so homey and comfortable feeling, undescribable! Our stay would have been completely different if we stayed down in Kona, or at a mega-resort. Its only 10 minutes from the inn to Kona and totally worth it! It is so quiet and beautiful you may just lay by the pool all day! Even just walking around the property and seeing all the kinds of fruit trees and flowers growing averywhere is relaxing. There are great pictures on their website, but its even prettier in person, and the rooms are bigger then the pictures make them seem.

Furnishings were elegant; the Hibiscus Room was tastefully decorated, beautifully furnished and had sweeping views of the Pacific. We watched cruise ships sail in; we watched glorious sunsets. The bed, linens, even the soap, were spectacular. Breakfast, from the fresh fruit grown on the premises, to the innovations of chef Brian, and the home-grown Kona coffee, kept us going all day. Snacks and fresh juice in the afternoon, and a surprise slice of fresh lime pie in our ohana refrigerator were yummy. We were lucky in that for some of our 7-night, 8-day stay, we had the inn almost to ourselves. It was like having our own private home in Hawaii, where shoes are left at the lanai and an ohana spirit fills the house. We felt stress slip away almost immediately upon our arrival. Who could ask for anything more?  My favorite place was the crow's nest on the roof, where the trade winds blew and the sunsets were unbelieveable. The pool was clear and cold; the roosters pleasant; the geckos colorful; the torch ginger plants beautiful, even the mongoose seemed comfortable!  We were treated like family and yet, our privacy was ensured. We loved the place and will visit again.  Our only suggestion would be to make the entire grounds of the inn and its surroundings completely smoke-free (the inn itself is a no-smoking zone, but the entire property should be, too, in our opinion).

The layout of the Inn is such that although there were other guests, it seemed as if we were staying at our own private island retreat.    The Inn is conveniently located only 15 minutes from Kailua-Kona but you'll feel like you're in another world. And if you're a golfer, Makalei Golf Club and Kona Country Club are also a mere 15-20 minute drive.    We stayed in the Gardenia Suite with panoramic views of the Kona coast. The view was rivaled only by the one to be found from the rooftop gazebo, our favorite morning spot. The bed was as comfortable as any we've slept in and stepping into the rock shower was like being treated to a foot massage each morning. Sheets and towels rivaled those we've had in 5-star hotels. We also appreciated the double sinks and special touches like fresh flowers by the bed and handmade soap.    Breakfast was served in one of the common rooms with incredible coastal views at a communal table that facilitated interesting conversation with other guests. Brian's breakfast treats were outstanding starting with fresh juices, Kona coffee and a large plate of local fruits including several we'd never tried before. This was followed by a hot entree that was different and delicious each morning. In the afternoon, drinks and snacks were set out in the same room. If dinner had also been offered, we might never have set foot off the property. But Holuakoa Cafe, about 1/4 mile away, offers dinner several nights a week and there are numerous restaurants in Kailua-Kona. The staff provided great restaurant suggestions and procured reservations for us. There is a also a guest kitchen for those who feel ambitious enough to cook.    When we did wander off the property, the staff provided us with snorkel gear, excellent suggestions for snorkeling spots as well as tips on where to stop along the way for shopping and dining.

57045831,50,The Holoualoa Inn is a unique treasure.,"My husband and I had a relaxing stay at the Holualoa for five days in early February. Upon arrival we were warmly greeted by Diane and given a welcome tour of the facilities. The Inn is spacious and has a traquil, beautiful atmosphere. It is in a private, garden setting yet it's only a two minute walk to the quaint Holualoa Road where there are a number of art galleries.  We stayed in the Gardenia Suite decorated in an Asian theme. We really enjoyed the separate sitting room with it's attractive furnishings. The sofa and chair were comfy. The sitting room is windows on two sides so you have a panoramic view of the mountain side, the ocean and Kailua Kona. The breeze comes through nicely to cool in the evening. The pool is lovely in a serene setting and there are comfortable lounging chairs and gazebo there. The bedroom was very nice and has two wall size closets. The linens are top quality and the bed really comfortable too. The small lanai is perfect for star gazing.  We felt comfortable here, the staff were professional, f and unpretentious. We felt welcome and at home. The breakfast room is open and airy. The breakfasts prepared by the Inn's chef, Brian, were delicious and fresh and innovative. The fresh juices every morning were a treat and the fresh Kona coffee is grown right on the property. There are homemade snacks, coffee and juice available all day. Brian, Kat and all the staff were helpful and very friendly.  I loved the well tended tropical gardens, song birds and roosters crowing , fruit trees, the coffee plantation and the labyrinthe and being up on the mountain away from the crowds and away from the atmosphere of town. Yet we were only a short drive from the ocean, sightseeing and shopping. Our best dining experience was the Holuakoa Restaurant just down the road from the Inn. The food and Hawaiin atmosphere there was better than anywhere else in the Kona area. Also try The Coffee Shack for lunch.  We would recommend the Holualoa Inn and would love to come back someday.

The location in terms of the grounds and immediate surroundings is gorgeous. However, there is only one restaurant within walking distance; all the others require a 15 or 20 minute drive.    (With such a great chef, we wonder why the Inn doesn't serve dinner a few times a week too - all the facilities are there.)    We liked having access to a BBQ and kitchen facilities so we could prepare one or two of our own meals. (And keep our wine cool!)    Only two very minor criticisms.The bath towels didn't seem to absorb moisture very well. We wonder if the softening agent used in washing them actually repelled water? And the swimming pool could use a little heating in February!    We particularly liked having personal requests met so promptly - a thinner pillow for example, or an alternative food choice at breakfast.

54039396,50,So Amazing....I wouldn't even consider staying anywhere else,"Holualoa Inn is quite possibly the best place we have ever stayed...it was one of the most expensive places we've stayed, but it's Hawaii and worth every penny! I am a little wary to stay at a B&B this small - my husband and I usually prefer larger Inns (8-12 rooms) b/c sometimes the 4-6 room B&B can feel too much like staying in somebody's house, but Holualoa is very spread out (the rooms are NOT all grouped together) and there is a whole staff to take care of the grounds and guests. Holualoa is wonderful in this respect. The breakfasts are fantastic and the afternoon/evening cookies and drinks are wonderful, too! Who doesn't like fresh limeade - made with limes from the property...and fresh guava juice from the property?! The whole house was so clean, bed comfortable, and showers were wonderful with lava stone bottoms. It cooled off nicely in the evening making it very comfortable to sleep. We were a little turned off by the 'no shoes' rule at first b/c we're just not accustomed to that and nobody had warned us about it - so this is your warning....not wearing shoes inside the house is a Hawaiin custom and since you are visiting a place that has a different culture, you should try to embrace that...(kind of like when you go to Europe and drink tea at tea time whether you like it or not). After a day or two, I was completely fine with the 'no shoes rule' - after all, the floors were spotless. After a few days I couldn't even remember what day it was anymore....how many days we had been there, how many we had left....It was a wonderful relaxing time and we look forward to returning.....I wouldn't even consider staying at another property on the island.",Jan 2010,November 2009,Traveled as a couple,,"Cincinnati, Ohio"

53390327,50,The best place on the Big Island,"I found this place by visiting their website after reading a guide book review that said it was worth the splurge. The website is a great resource and extremely accurate and thorough. You can use that information to decide if this place is for you. We loved the location near the attractions of Kona, but off the beaten path of the touristy strip down below. The rooms and house and grounds are even more beautiful than depicted on the website. This was a personal residence before it was a B&B, and the attention to detail really shows. We spent two nights in the Ginger Room, which we chose for its second floor location. The other second floor room with a view of Kona is spectacular. We cannot say enough about how delicious the breakfast was. Brian is a great cook and truly has the Aloha spirit. It is relaxing to walk around the grounds amidst the coffee trees and other tropical foliage. A short walk or drive up the hill and you are in the midst of the funky little galleries and restaurants of Holualoa. We plan on returning to this very location on our next visit to the Big Island. We stayed in four different locations, and this was the very best. You get what you pay for here. Make sure you get good directions, since the signage on the main road is very small and easy to miss (possibly intentional).",Jan 2010,December 2009,Traveled as a couple,,"Arlington Heights, IL"
53239191,50,The most relaxing place to stay on the Big Island,"This is our hands down favorite place to stay when we go to the Big Island. It is so peaceful and relaxing.

We dreamed of coming back again and made it happen this year. The staff are so friendly and accommodating. The treat you like family and want to make sure you are really comfortable and having a good time. One of our favorite things is the breakfast each morning. The fabulous chef, Brian, is amazing. He loves to feed you and we love to eat! The breakfast is different each day. They use as much home grown fruits and ingredients as possible. The fruit platter is so cleansing in the morning. And nothing beats the 100% Kona coffee from their own plantation. I could really go on on and on about this place. Lastly, I will say that the view of Kona is amazing. The inn is really open with a lot of windows and fresh air and being able to watch the sunset from almost all of the common areas is so breathtaking. Would love to come back again.",Jan 2010,January 2010,Traveled as a couple,,"berkeley, ca"
47674018,50,Absolutely beautiful casual elegance with every detail thought of here.,"We found the Holualoa Inn close to the last minute by searching the web. We wanted a bed and breakfast that was away from the hectic touristy climate of Kailua-Kona while still being close enough to enjoy the restaurants and night life. The website promised a beautiful location and atmosphere and we were not disappointed.    When we arrived and drove down the driveway through the beautifully manicured grounds we knew we were in for a treat. The lobby greeted us with warm wood paneling and floors that continued throughout the spectacularly appointed inn.    Our room was perfect. The main feature was the floor to ceiling picture window that looked out over the coffee plantation, down the hillside to Kona and to the pacific beyond. We enjoyed watching the sunset from the extremely comfortable king size bed that was covered in the softest, satiny high thread count sheets and perfectly soft and downy pillows. We were in the Hibiscus Room.    In the morning we were greeted by the friendly Brian who made us a different gourmet sensation each morning, always accompanied by their own Holualoa coffee and a fruit plate that presented a different cornucopia of island fruit each day.    We enjoyed a perfect outdoor, open air massage for two in the inn's massage gazebo. And don't miss watching the sunset from the comfort of the rooftop gazebo while lounging on the comfy rattan lounge chairs.    This place has thought of everything. If you're tired of eating at restaurants there is a nicely appointed kitchenette downstairs with a refrigerator for you to store some groceries. If you decide to prepare dinner here, you can eat outside in a gazebo by the pool and watch the sunset, or at the large dining table inside by the kitchen. There are guest laundry facilities if you need to wash a few things. And they have a hospitality suite that you can use after check out. We had a late flight, so we stored our luggage in the hospitality suite, spent the day snorkeling and sunning on the beach, returned to the inn, showered and then left. It was the perfect end to our perfect stay at the holualoa inn.    Go and you won't be disappointed!",Oct 2009,October 2009,Traveled as a couple,,"San Carlos, California"
47526877,30,Beautiful B&B but over priced,"To start with the positives the views and open air setup are outstanding. My wife and I were very happy with the overall appearance of this B&B nestled within the coffee trees overlooking Kona and the ocean. The grounds were well kept, beautifully furnished, very clean, and the staff was friendly and helpful. Brian, the head chef, was really cool guy to talk to and made some tasty breakfasts which always started with there own fresh grown fruit and ended with a hot dish. You could easily lounge around the pool the entire day if you didn't feel like taking the 10 minute drive to the closest beach in Kona. The remote location makes it a great relaxing place. You will hear sounds like you would in any forest which include insects & birds during the night so if you are looking for absolute silence your better off staying in an air conditioned resort. It is a little warm in the rooms around 8:00 PM but by 10-11PM my wife and I were quite comfortable (our room had a ceiling fan that helped keep us cool). Kona is a quick drive away, but don't stay here if you don't plan on renting a car and want to leave the grounds. We also enjoyed the juice/tea and fresh baked cookies that were available everyday. There is also a fridge, microwave, and TV in the common room that was convenient to use. The bath towels were very plush, which is hard to come by these days. As for activities, we recommend snorkeling at 2 step (about 20 minutes away), touring Greenwell coffee farm, and dining at Ke'ei restaurant.    Now for the negatives.  My wife and I stayed in the Coffee Cherry room ($330/night) which is supposed to have sole access to the ""private"" hot tub. However, on our third night we discovered a guest using the hot tub, which is unacceptable seeing as how we paid for it (the hot tub is actually located outside a few steps from the room, but there is no sign indicating that the hot tub is reserved). Another downside was that the walls and ceiling were really thin. Our room had guests above and behind us so we could hear them showering, walking and unfortunately flushing the toilet. We assumed we were paying a premium for our room, but with the noise from other guests and the hot tub use by others left us disappointed (plus there was no view to speak of to make up for things--just of the front lawn). I mentioned before about the nature sounds: there are pleasant nature sounds and then there are obnoxious roosters who will wake you up at 4:30-6:00 am. Unless you are used to farm life or a really heavy sleeper be forewarned (ear plugs were provided though and the windows blocked out most of the outside noise when all closed though the room then got a bit stuffy). I also have to mention the bill with the recommended tip amounts for service that put us off a bit. It almost seemed like an attempt to guilt you into leaving a tip. Honestly, you pay enough as it is to stay there and guests who want to leave a tip will do so whether or not they are reminded.    In closing, we agree with Fodor's (2009) review that this is a lovely place if you don't mind overpaying a little.",Oct 2009,October 2009,Traveled as a couple,,Seattle

39004974,50,What a truly lovely experience!,"Where to start? Well it was our annual family vacation complete with six stressed out execs and one very loving but fiesty two year old. Just traveling with a two year old could make or break a trip but I forwarned Noe, Diane and the rest of the fabulous staff and they were ready. The rooms were beautiful and very clean. The decor was fantastic and very well thought out. Walking the labrynth was amazing as was the sunsets. Truly a time of decompression from the fast paced lives we lead. I think what I loved best was that it was our house for 12 blissful days. Meaning anything we wanted to do or not do was completely our choice and the staff made sure we were well kept. Breakfasts were amazing, my son would run and open the shoji door to the kitchen and high five Brian as he cooked then into the office to see the girls. Even more amazing is how many times Noe and Diane picked up the little one so that we could eat! I cannot say enough about all of them. Everyone at the Holualoa became part of our family or we became part of their's not quite sure but the fact that I could name them all two weeks after the vacation has got to mean something.

38126141,50,Absolutely one of Absolute Finest B&Bs you'll find on the planet,"....Assuming you want to visit the Big Island and want utter beauty and crowd-less serenity.......but also want to be no more than 10-15 minutes from a terrific dinner or other signs of civilization. And mainly because the the property itself is so stunning, as well as the people who work and live there, makes the place special. These people- Noe and her husband Hector, daughter (Empress) Kai, Diane, and a kick-you know- what breakfast cook and person named Brian, and other beautiful/wonderful people: Kat, Chris, Landon, Jake, Arlene, Steve, and masseuse Lokelani, just imbibe the Aloha spirit and I began to wonder what I've been missing in my life, or at least what I can ADD to my life back on the mainland. So far the answer that I get is: Being at ease in my skin in my work environment- these folks, for the most part even with life's inevitable downs, Really enjoy where they work because I've never seen so many unforced or non-fake smiles. I immediately became infected and starting doing the same. What a concept!.....duh. So they, and the land, offer a ton- as in ways that can't be measured. And if you're a loner and do not want to interact, and just get peace and quiet, the place has that in equal share. ...Sigh....    The property feels and appears to be physically located pretty much in heaven. It's situated on a beautiful hillside close to town, but in the middle of a freaking coffee plantation up on a hillside, yet minutes to downtown Kona and the beaches, with cows baying in the distance and all kinds of tropical birds and beauty surrounding you.....it's the whole ten yards. (A realtor would have a field day selling this place with all the possible descriptions, but I hope they never do.) the decor of the place is stunning: Asian antiques. Gorgeous but not over-stated. The family, however was always on high alert at breakfast when my 2 yr. old nephew would pick up and try to play ""the guitar."" (That was something I did NOT want to find out how much it would cost to replace!) The spread-out, gorgeous, bamboo-floored, mulit-leveled building (only 4 or 5 parking spaces!! I love it!) is well away from the small road from which you arrive, and there are living rooms that open right out into lawns and gardens. Don't worry about the occasional mongoose (like a small yellow squirrel) or other critters- they don't want to deal with humans if they can help it. And the layout is perfectly located if you want to cruise to the rest of Big Island, which we easily did. We met families who had been there for 50-100 years. For ex, we caught the stunning Mauna Lea Summit volcano/star gazing tour (ask for guide ""Rick"" and tip him and everyone well) about 15 minutes away in a local shopping center. Simple. (don't go if you have a hard time with low oxygen, the mountain is at a tad below 14K! But they only have you up there for about 15 minutes anyways. Seeing the place was like being on the top of the world for about 15 min., and indeed, including the mountain measured below see level, MK is the world's tallest mountain. The star-gazing spot using their 11"" GPS-tracking telescopes is possibly the best star-gazing on this planet, bar none, because at the location they use you get a nearly 180 degree arc view of our dense galaxy at 9,000 feet, while in warm parkers. Wait till you see your Milky Way galaxy at 9K feet, with many shooting stars, just after it gets dark! Holy cow!! Also- I have no affiliation with this particular outfit- but that Rick is as smart and a good star guide, and I've never seen so many stars, ever. The company is well-organized and prepared with parkas and gloves, and even the vegie wrap box dinner was decent..)    But my family is a (soon to not be) stressed-out family of executives- so the first three days of the 12 day vacation we did absolutely nothing.....and that allowed us to decompress and regain our senses, literally. Walking in the coffee plantation early morning brought me new perspectives. But what I really enjoyed was on the top (fourth) level of the somewhat Asian styled structure. They have an incredible look-out point on the top of the house. -A covered look-out promenade that has gorgeous, open, iron railing with 2 comfy loungers, along with a beautific Buddha statue, all of which allows you to look out for miles over the Pacific and Kona in utter Stillness. I could almost not believe how utterly peaceful that place is/was, and the stress just evaporated from my body. That place is like floating in heaven. Massages in the Lanai were heavenly, but I think next time I'm going to offer to carry the masseuse table up there myself, because that place is so special. The views are incredible, yet the place is close to town- it's the best of all worlds. The sounds you sometimes hear are large payayas and huge avocados falling from the trees. All I can suggest is that if you go there, you must absolutely WANT to relax, or have a good time in a beautiful place that you can make as your meeting point as you explore the island by day. (If you want an all-day bar on a crowded beach go to one of the major luxury hotels.) From the black sand beach to the Waimea valley, to snorkeling with the dolphins (don't approach them!) near Captain Cook bay, you can go as wild in the sun as you like. Or not and just vege. It's all there.    Lastly, beware of the cops and their radar guns at the bottom of the main drive to town- Loke drive- friendly guys, but their speed limit is strictly enforced at 25mph- but that and the 8-10 minute drive to the ocean and Kona is a very small price to pay for the truly central location of the property, and the incredible breakfasts that they serve. You will be served amazing fruit you never knew existed, plus the main breakfast courses are the best on the planet, and I've been all over the planet. Us Seattle-ites love our coffee. The coffee they sell is one of the very finest, if not the finest coffee I've ever had. That's a little scary coming from me. Lunches and dinners- you are on your own, so it helped that my brother-in-law and brother caught some serious tuna with Hector on his boat. There's a nice kitchen downstairs next to the pool (no stove but microwave & outdoor propane grill) so we had lunches covered. There are a few excellent restaurants- for for casual AND great food: Kewii (sp?) cafe in Keulauna (sp?)and Jackie Rey's come to mind, along with the usual so-so fare but stellar views at the many luxury hotels. Make sure you make any reservations for ""cruise ship Wednesdays"" on the prior Monday or it will be more difficult to get a reservation anywhere on Weds. You'll also need a rental car and Kona only has a couple of rockin' places, but they do rock (and with you'll get Hawaiian as well.) Noe and Diane seem to know everything about the island (having been raised there) and can handle everything, but don't tell them I said that! They are the greatest.

The view is magnificent, overlooking the coast. Loved the pool, our room, and did I mention Noi's scrumptous breakfast? and the Kona coffee and fresh fruit from the back yard? Oh, yes. Simply splendid. Will definitely stay here again if we ever get a chance to return. We had a late flight out our last day, and although we checked out we were able to leave our luggage for the day, return to the ""hospitality"" room to shower and prepare for our night flight home.

Since this was our Honeymoon that we've waited 5 years for, we hand picked everything and decided to stay wherever our hearts desired. Reviews were excellent and the actual property and staff far exceeded expectations!  From our arrival, everyone was so friendly and helpful. We picked the Plumeria Suite for the separate entrance and awesome bathroom. upon our arrival, everything was welcoming and the little touches were extra special. We received a personal tour of the home, afternoon tea and snacks, and a welcome note upon our arrival.  Nights were relaxing and quiet. Mornings were leisurely and we always looked forward to breakfast! Noe is a wonderful cook, and we always looked forward to what the next day's breakfast would bring. Noe was always helpful to ask our preferences, answer any questions we had, or just chat and share her aloha spirit. She is still one of our favorite parts of this establishment!  The grounds are extensive and beautiful. We spent and entire day just wndering around the Inn's grounds and exploring. I especially loved hunting for new flower varieties and picking any available fruits on the property. They encourage you to enjoy the property fully. I especially loved the gardening shears and vases at our disposal! My husband loved trying to get a picture of a mongoose!  If you're interested for an extra special experience, have Noe book a couple local trusted massage therpists. Splurge on the nearly 2 hour lomi lomi massage and have it up on the gazebo... beautiful to end right when the sun is setting. Still, the best massage I've ever had.  The home is my dream home. It is beautifully appointed, welcoming and serene. The grounds are little piece of heaven. If you're around when the vog sets in, it looks like you are literally floating in the clouds as the hillside and Kona are invisible.  I still dream of this place and can't wait to return!

Our accomodations were very clean and neat in the Hibicus room. Our view from the room was unbelievable and the bed was more comfortable that the one we had at the Farimont. The staff was like family after only a day and the breakfast each morning like dining at a fine restaurant. The staff was also very helpful in planning our itinerary for our limited free time and was spot on with their recommendations. We have stayed in B&Bs all over and this one would rank as one of the best.

From the breakfast room and outside terraces the panoramic view of the ocean and Kona coastline was stunning. The breakfast menu was thoughtfully prepared and served along with fresh juices and local fruit artfully arranged - in a word it was all ""delicious."" And in the afternoon there were freshly baked cookies or brownies available for guests to snack on. It was fun to walk around the landscaped property and find pineapples, mango trees, coffee plants, along with a gorgeous variety of flowers. The staff was knowledgeable and willing to help in any way to make our stay pleasant.

16942898,50,Luxury B & B,"We had a pleasant stay at the Holualoa Inn as part of our honeymoon. It certainly is very serene and beautifully furnished with many details considered. It is a short, 5 minute walk to the small village centre where you can pick up a few provisions from Paul's Place or browse the several art galleries. There are plenty of spaces for parking should you require it, no valet - hurrah!    One thing worth noting is that you are not allowed to wear shoes on the wooden floors at the property so have to remove them at the entrance. This wasn't a problem for us but isn't to everyones taste. The place has few doors so is very open so when the staff leave at 5pm-6pm each night, you are on your own with the nature! If you like to lock yourself away safely then this may not make you feel too secure. The room itself was gorgeous and very, very clean. We did feel that the sheets felt a little damp at night though but think that was more to do with the atmosphere as the rooms do not have air conditioning.    It is a lovely get-away place but one can feel like it is too perfect that you cannot truly relax, almost like you are intruding. The breakfasts were very nice with a fresh fruit starter and then another course of pancakes etc. There is no choice with the breakfast but they were very nice but not everyone will like what is served, as I didn't one morning.    To echo previous reviews, the final bill contained details of recommended tipping levels and amounts (eg. 10% - 20% of your overall room charge) which we found left a very bad taste in our mouth. We have never experienced this on any of our US trips in the past and found it let the place down. We were aware it was going to happn due to other reviews on this site so felt quite anxious about how we would approach the situation.

16531193,50,"Private, Sophisticated and Genuine","We stayed at the Holualoa Inn in June '07, for one night (wish it had been more!) to cap our honeymoon. We spent five days at a resort in Maui, then flew into Hilo, rented a car, spent an overnight touring around Volcano, and then drove to Kona and the Holualoa Inn before flying back to the States.    The building itself is lovely. Gorgeous inlaid wood, art, and furniture. We arrived in the middle of a sudden rainstorm, and appreciated the carport for unloading luggage. We stayed in the Gardenia Suite. Loved the exceptionally comfy bed, closets, very plush towels, bathroom, and view from the sitting area.    We walked up the driveway in the afternoon and found champagne at the liquor store just up the street. Stored it in the communal fridge downstairs, and then enjoyed it in pretty flutes in rocking chairs on one of the balconies at sunset. We used the hot tub, and my husband enjoyed the lovely pool (too cold for me!). The grounds were spectacular and it was fun to see so many things growing (I'd never seen a coffee plant!). We wrapped up the evening with a puzzle that we borrowed from downstairs. A wonderful night.    We were amazed to show up to breakfast and realize that there were 5 other couples staying there! We arrived at the same time as one other couple, but didn't see them for the rest of the evening and just assumed that the place was empty. Breakfast was spectacular. We were the first to arrive and last to leave. It was exceptionally hard to pack up and head to the airport -- we really wished that we'd alloted a second night. The entire experience was beautiful, detailed, comforting, peaceful and rainy-side-of-the-island atmospheric. Hopefully we'll manage to come back -- such a memorable, wonderful experience.    ps.

15552613,30,Full disclosure: subtle pressure to tip at Holualoa Inn,"In the August 2006 ""member list"" for the Hawaii Island B & B Association, the Holualoa Inn room rates were listed as $175-$225. I have no idea what value has been added to this property in 20 months. But in evaluating your different lodging options, bear in mind that this B & B gives you a bill at the end of your stay that makes it awkward to not tip. The invoice suggests tips (with actual amts in case you can't do the math ) ranging from 10% to 20%. We struggled with this - the staff was delightful, likable and helpful - but we weren't sure that we had received service above and beyond the usual expectations of a premium B & B. We saw another couple also experiencing angst over the tipping dilemma.    Honestly, the situation left me with a sour taste. Personally I felt like I did not get value for my money. While it is not Holualoa Inn's fault that I did not use the lovely pool, nor the romantic hot tub or that I didn't appreciate the caloric bombs for b'fast - still, my lasting impression is ""wow, we spent too much money at this B & B.""",May 2008,April 2008,,,"Atlanta, Georgia"

It was our 30th anniversary and it was a memorable place for a memorable occasion. Because there are few walls in the common spaces the scents from the flowering trees are everpresent. There are beautiful gardens and an artistic tiled swimming pool. The floors and walls are made of beautiful wood and everyone takes off their shoes to walk inside, which gives an air of quiet and peacefulness. There was a covered sitting area on the roof which was my favorite place to read and absorb the view of the ocean and town below. Our flight left late at night and they provide you with a small room with bathroom facilities and a key to keep your suitcases in after you have checked out. That was such a great thing. The staff was quick to help schedule a trip or with helpful info about the area. We got a personal little tour of their coffee plantation and of course drank lots of it with their exquisitely prepared and served breakfast every day . Breakfast was innovative and delicious using fresh local foods and it was so nice conversing with the other guests at the table. We stayed in the hibiscus room and the view and accomodations were perfect. Although it was a bit pricey , it was worth it because of the special feeling you got being there.

The breakfasts were fantastic, overlooking the breathtaking view (Holualoa is in the hills, so you can see the whole coastline).    The rooms had every convenience I could have wanted and the bed was incredibly comfortable, with wonderful bedding. While it's not on the beach, it does have a pretty pool and hot tub, and it's an easy drive to nearby beaches.    They only have 6 rooms (half of which were taken when we were there), so we practically had the place to ourselves. It was complete paradise, and I would go back in a heartbeat.

The swimming pool and grounds, including two hot tubs, were beautifully kept and the breakfasts were gorgeous and we never managed to finish a whole one. This is a different class of B&B, reflected in the price, but you get what you pay for with all the little extras, such as fresh cakes every afternoon and coffee and tea available from a table by the kitchen for most of the day. It is perfect for couples, especially honeymooners as the staff make you feel very special and you don't really see most of the other guests apart from at breakfast, where it was good to compare notes on where we all had been. The view is fantastic of coast and the temperature is cooler as it is some way up the mountain, however this is not a place you can get to without a car.

8101200,50,Perfect Inn,"My girlfriend and I stayed three nights at the Holuloa Inn in the Hibiscus Room. We had an amazing time. At first, it was a bit spooky because we arrived after 6pm, and there was no one around. We poked our noses around, however, and quickly felt at home, although we felt like we had to be on the quiet side. The property is gorgeous. It is amazingly well-kept. The rooms are clean and very stylish, the gardens are beautiful, the pool and hot tub were in great shape, and there were lots of thoughtful touches, e.g. a flashlight in the room. The biggest selling point is the view out over the Kona coast. It was beautiful and mezmerizing any time, but the sunsets in particular were amazing. The breakfasts were great, too, although they tended to be on the sweet side. There were two other couples staying at the same time, and we talked and said hello, but it's not a typically B&B situation where you have small talk over breakfast; a plus in our book. This is certainly not a place for families or children, but for sophisticated couples it is the best. One of my favorite hotels ever in fact, a very peaceful and relaxing place. I had two quibbles, the first is that there were a lot of bugs, including a big spider in the bathroom. The property is in a tropical forest, so this is to be expected, and my girlfriend cared a lot more about this than I did. Second, the coffee maker in the communal kitchen hadn't been emptied, and there were moldy grounds left in it. I washed it out, and it wasn't a problem. By the way, they provide a gas grill by the pool if you want to cook out. We took advantage of this, and had a nice (and cheap) dinner by the pool.

6138622,30,Great view but pricey,"My wife and I stayed here on the last night of our honeymoon. The view was great, the location was nice, the staff was generally courteous, and the open-air setup was outstanding. The bed was luxurious, and it was a great finale to our trip. It felt like being in an exclusive resort - one for just the few of us who managed to find this spot. Upon arrival, you are asked to remove your shoes so as not to damage the hardwood floors. Breakfast was very nice as well - presentation, taste and quantity were all good, including both hot and cold dishes and local coffee. The concierge book suggested things to do and places to see both near and far on the island. There were some negatives, however. The temperature was a little higher than I expected, and with no AC we left the windows open... but I had a hard time sleeping with the various nature sounds - dripping water, crickets or cicaedas, and birds, including a very early rooster in the distance. Funny, but I had no problems with the ocean when we were staying right over the water, while I did have trouble with the lower-volume but not as predictable sounds here... the other thing that soured me, was that the bill included ""suggested gratuity"" amounts of 10, 15 and 20% (for ""good, great, or excellent"" service) on top of a bill that was already double what the guide book which suggested it listed, and also on top of a $50 extra charge for only staying a single night. I'd never seen that at a hotel, before, and particularly not one where I was already spending nearly $400 for one night. Overall, I'm glad we stayed here instead of, say, the Sheraton; and it was a nice way to wrap up our trip, but I do not want to go back... and I didn't really feel completely welcome... like maybe I wasn't old money enough or sophisticated enough to be a desireable guest there.

The architecture is amazing and the common rooms are tastefully appointed and the pool and hot tub were fantastic. Each room was very comfortable and oozed an old world charm seldom found in Hawaii. The common room with its small kitchenette was really convenient and as we had the entire place to ourselves the entire experience/ambience was perfect. Sunset by the pool is not to be missed as the views are incredible. Breakfast in the morning was excellent and highly recommended. Our only reservation about returning is the rather substantial price. It was a great one time vacation as we were in Kona for a wedding but the per room price is significant. Plus the ambience would not be same when sharing the place with strangers.

5008564,40,Still Our Favorite,"We just completed an excellent 8-day stay at the Holualoa Inn. We had stayed there for 3 days in 1997, loved the experience, and had corresponded with Thea Brown, the resident manager, since.    As others have noted, the place has changed hands over this winter, which has caused considerable confusion and some disappointment.    We had reserved in September for our March stay, before the change of ownership. When we arrived, the staff were completely surprised, and initially dubious that we did, infact, have a reservation. Fortunately, we had the necessary documentation and they were able to swap around to create a suitable vacancy. The new owner, Sandy Hazen, instructed her manager to ""do whatever was needed to make this right"", including a very deep discount.    Over the course of the week, I was able to meet with Sandy on several occasions, and despite our initial skepticism, we came away with a very good feeling about the whole experience, and a belief that our favorite country inn is in the hands of a ""good steward"". In fact, it turned out so well that we declined the proferred discount and paid the originally agreed price.    Changes are definitely afoot, some better, some maybe not, but the net effect is that we will return, probably within the year.    1. Thea Brown, the personable manager of the past ten years, is gone.    2. Some of the new staff are still finding their way, but this will sort out.    3. There is remodeling going on. Some folks have commented negatively on this, but it is long overdue. The magnificent house was definitely wearing out. They are closing for the month of May to get this done properly. Sandy assures me that the rates will not increase to cover these costs.    4. The lavish cooked breakfasts are a thing of the past. The health dept. has clamped down on ""uninspected kitchens"" operating under the b&b exemption, so they have gone to a cold breakfast. Still pretty elaborate, with a wide variety of fruits, cereals, breads, lox, spreads, etc.    Still good value, and well worth the visit.",Apr 2006,March 2006,,,"Ashland, Oregon"

We noticed that it is going through a change in ownership and the prices are going up substantially next year. The location, while up on the hillside overlooking Kona, is very peaceful and quiet and you get used to the drive up the long winding road to Holualoa. The views are fantastic from up there and nice and cool in the evenings for sleeping. There was a little too much furniture coming in and starting to clutter in places. The staff are excellent and most helpful and would only recommend they strengthen the morning coffee!! They make a gourmet type breakfast but we much prefer plain old Bacon and Eggs, toast and fruit, etc. I think they may be pricing themselves a little too high ( 40% increase )for the accomodation and would return if they were still giving a long stay discount as in the past( no longer avilable ).  We wish them the best and hope it all works out for the new owners.",Mar 2006,,,,"Kelowna, British Columbia"

This is a new development that we did not see during our previous stays, so we were intrigued from the drive on in. A charming staff member welcomed us with an enthusiastic ""aloha"" and showed us to our room. We booked the same room that we stayed in five years ago (The lovely Hibiscus Room) and were amazed when we walked in to see a beautiful new bed with white fluffy linens. (Before the renovations, the beds were really old and had bright tacky Hawaiian bedspreads) Everything looked a little more polished and refined than we remember it being: New bamboo beds, high-end balinese and indonesian teak furnishings and BEAUTIFUL new artwork throughout the inn. The menu seems to have been upgraded as well. When we were served breakfast the plating was amazing and the orange juice was FRESH SQUEEZED!!! We were sad about the rate increase but after 5 days of enjoying the new improvements feel like it was worth every penny.

New balinese furnishings have been brought in and when we were there it appeared to be freshly painted. The breafasts were gourmet quality with organic ingredients and fresh squeezed oj. It looks to us as if the new owners are making up for lost time on the maintenance. When looking at old pictures of the place it looked neglected...

4588792,20,Fall from Grace,"We have stayed at the Inn numerous times since 1997 and have always been delighted until our most recent stay last month. The Inn is going through a transformation under the new ownership and we were disappointed to have the usual tranquility of our stay interrupted with the constant presence of workers staining the outside of the facilities. In the past there had been an elegance to the simplicity of the furnishings, however, this year there was a steady flow of new furniture being moved in making it feel more like a furniture store than a Bed and Breakfast. The feeling of aloha that has always been present in past years was significantly diminished with the departure of the innkeeper. In addition, we were shocked to learn that the price of the room we normally reserve had increased from slightly under $200 (including discount for length of stay) to $290 (discounts no longer being offered).    We spent much of our time looking around the island for other places to stay. We have found other beautiful places that are much nicer and have the spirit of aloha we expect to find in Hawaii.

Although  Holualoa Inn added 2 more rooms about 8 years ago, the overall maintainence of the inn  has not been kept up.  This can be a romantic setting for a couple, but the staff leaves at 5 pm, and the guests are on  their own if any problems occur. The location alone is breathtaking. The view is stunning.

As long as they kept their pricesetting to a normal level for a B&B ,it was good value for money but now that the average prices went up about 40 to 50 $ per room/night they really overestimated themselves !  This Inn is OK if you want to spend 2 nights max but the new price is way too much for what it's worth .",Jan 2006,April 2005,,,"Overijse, Belgium"
3845002,50,So comfortable!,"After much searching online, we settled on the Holualoa Inn as a place that matched our tastes. We wanted to be away from the tourist crowds, but we didn't want to be totally isolated. Our choice proced to be a good one.    Not everyone will be so lucky as we were to have two nights as the only guests, but what an advantage it was, having the staff all to ourselves to pick their brains about what to see and do as well as just for convivial conversation. As a result, we learned what they really thought of some of the restaurants that the guidebooks reviewed - quite helpful information!    The building and grounds at the Inn are stunning - terrific views of Kailua-Kona way down the hill, and a short walk up the drive to the galleries of Holualoa. In truth, we didn't spend much time in the village or even down the hill in Kailua-Kona. Instead, we used the Inn as a jumping off point for driving excursions north and south. We didn't at all mind the drive into town or elsewhere for dinner - we had a particularly lovely meal out at the Four Seasons and were home again afterwards in 20 minutes only.    Breakfast is a highlight of the day at the Inn. One morning the coconut pancakes would have kept coming but for our full bellies. The breakfasts were always tasty and generous, and, of course, lots of their coffee. Our room was one of the more basic, yet it was large and bright and handsomely decorated.    The Inn was also very accommodating of our late afternoon flight plans on our departure. They were unable to allow us to keep our bags in our room all day because of another booking, but we did get a locked shower room with an invitation to take advantage of the shower facility to freshen up before our flight. We were glad of that on a hot, sunny day.    The building and grounds are delightful. The view is terrific. The breakfasts are scrumptious. We recommend getting away from the tourist strip bustle of town and relaxing uphill at the Inn. We hope to return!",Sep 2005,August 2005,,,
3697711,50,A Great Place,"We spent 5 days at Holualoa Inn and were very happy. The building is stunning, the grounds and view are delightful. and the staff is great. Best of all, the place is very unlike a large resort in that it is quiet and relaxing...it was a pleasure to come back here at the end of the day. On top of that, the breakfast is without question the best we have ever had at a B and B.",Jul 2005,July 2005,,,virginia
1511387,50,Heaven!,My husband and I spent ten days on the Big Island last year. We had intended to move from B&B to B&B but in the end we spent most of our time at the Halualoa Inn. We've been to some beautiful places but this ranks right at the top of our list. The accommodations are first class and the staff more than friendly and helpful. I'd go back in a skinny minute if it weren't such a looooong flight!,Dec 2003,,,,Florida
1271848,50,Wonderful B & B,"I just returned from Hawaii, and spent three nights at this beautiful inn. The six bedroom house is wonderful -- open airy rooms, great food, and a very helpful and friendly staff. The inn has a nice pool, hot tub, pool table, rooftop gazebo, etc. It is a very comfortable place to stay and I highly recommend it! The only downfall was that it was about a twenty minute drive to the beach and was typically cloudy up on the mountain that the inn resides on.",Sep 2003,,,,"State College, Pennsylvania"
