Everyone was very polite and helpful, and always greeting you with a smile.
Fantastic view from the room, with a great spot for watching the sunset by the pool area. Pool area was great, just as pool service. Food was delicious. Beach section accessible to hotel guests, with a 1-2 minute walk to the open Waikiki Beach.
Cleaning/turn down service happens 2 times a day, and they always leave you a small souvenir the second time. We stayed for about 11 days and the souvenirs started repeating after a week's time so stay at least 7 days to collect them all :)
The 3 restaurants in (House without a Key, Orchids, La Mer) were all great with a varied palette of dishes.
It rained 2 days while we were there and there were freely available umbrellas for guests to use.
No complaints. Highly recommended. Would definitely go back.","Date of stay: September 2022","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We decided to stay here instead of the conference hotel where our meetings were. Clearly an upcharge but the payoff was a  boutique, very intimate property. It’s not a true resort (no beach, etc.)  as it’s smaller and in in downtown Waikiki. It’s an upscale hotel experience within walking distance of lots of things.  Hawaiian music every night at the house without a key. The restaurants were great but everything does close pretty early- 8:30. The  service was the best we’ve had anywhere- everyone is amazing. Literally two people plus a supervisor cleaned our room.  Lewers lounge (tues to sat) is the most amazing experience.

I’ve been to Hawaii 14 times and stayed at a variety of hotels. This is hands down the best one. It’s located right on the beach, and is quiet and peaceful. It’s a bespoke resort. We had room 1441, an ocean view. The room was so spacious, very clean and looked to be newly renovated. It had every amenity I could think of. The balcony was spacious. The beach right in front of the hotel is small but the upside is very few people were there. When we wanted to go in the ocean we simply went through the gate by the pool and walked right in. The bottom is smooth and largely free of rocks. The pool is large and well heated. The chairs have comfy mattresses and the attendants were attentive and friendly. We really enjoyed the restaurants House Without a Key and Orchids. Each day they had musicians and singers performing at sunset outside with the backdrop of Diamond Head and the setting sun. Later in the evening we went to Lewers Lounge for classic cocktails and piano music. The hotel is centrally located and it’s easy to walk to shops and restaurants yet go back to the hotel and just enjoy the peaceful ambience. The clientele seemed to be mostly couples and a few small children. This is not a party spot nor a place for anyone looking for bars, sports on TV and so on. The service was outstanding in every way and all of the staff we encountered were friendly, happy and helpful. There is a well staffed concierge desk and we booked a great sunset cruise which left from the beach in front of the hotel. We also got good information on Pearl Harbor. Overall this is the best trip I’ve ever had to Hawaii and we plan to return to the Halekulani again within the year.","Date of stay: September 2022","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The Halekulani provides a unique 5-star experience in a traditional Hawaiian location that for the most part has gone mid-range in recent years. Most of the new luxury resorts are now located on the other islands. But if you want to spend a few days on historic Waikiki Beach at the highest level of accommodations and service, the Halekulani is The Place. We chose the Halekulani to celebrate our 50th Anniversary, as the original ceremony also took place in Honolulu. It was a good choice.

At the top of its room selection, the Halekulani offers three absolutely beautiful Premier Suites, each 2100 to 2500 sq. ft. They are located in a very private connected but separate area of the hotel, closest to the water with great views of Diamond Head and Waikiki beach. Each suite has its own dedicated butler (sole duty is to take care of their assigned suite). The butlers each have a desk a few feet from the door of their assigned suite. We found this a bit “too close,” and after the first day, requested this service be discontinued. A rare level of service, just not us. 

We stayed in the Orchid Suite, on the ground floor with a small but very nice private lawn. The Royal and the Halekulani suites occupied the two floors immediately above. Included in each are three large rooms: a living room and well equipped kitchen; a large bedroom; and a very nice, spacious TV room and office.  The audio for our large flat screen television was a top drawer MacIntosh integrated amplifier and speaker system. Surely not typical hotel stuff.

A real test came early on when we experienced difficulty with controlling the air conditioning system. The three thermostats each had a mind of its own. We reached out and Setsu Nakamura, a Guest Services Manager, responded immediately. She handled the situation promptly and more important, very graciously. 

Yes, indeed, the Halekulani is a 5-star experience on par with the best in the world. In fact, my biggest concern is how this experience has spoiled the two of us.

A tip: when booking online, the Premier Suites show no availability. The site doesn't reveal that to book, a call to the hotel is required.","Date of stay: August 2022","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The beauty of the hotel's manicured gardens, ikebana flower displays, and warm woodwork is complemented by the perfection of its service, especially the rigor of its servers at its restaurants, who have the precision of the staff of Downton Abbey. It is a strange and wonderful thing to look across Waikiki Bay towards Diamond Head while having waiters in white tuxedoes deliver your elaborate breakfast, or to watch the live evening hula shows with a pina colada under the hotel's ancient, storm battered kiawe tree. You know that magic like this--on a beach--happens almost nowhere else. For comparisons, you'd have to look to the grand hotels of the French riviera or the Italian South, and even then you might well prefer the Halekulani.

Just got renovated and everything was perfect. The rooms were spacious, super comfortable, beds and sheets were super soft, dreamy. We had a gorgeous partial view of the ocean and Diamond Head crater. The staff was gracious and welcoming everywhere in the hotel. The beach is an easy access but you have to remember to bring your room key with you (they have a door to prevent people from outside the beach access the hotel which is smart). The grounds are beautiful and well kept. The attention to detail was great. Lovely stay.","Date of stay: August 2022","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

For my tastes, too many hotels are either over-glorified shopping malls and/or blare music everywhere and leave you with no peace, and they often are overcrowded, meaning annoying waits for the elevator and a general hustle-bustle that detracts from the vacation experience. 

In contrast, the Halekulani is a clean, modern space that is an island of calm and respite, free from the usual grind that attends a stay at large, corporate-run large hotels. The hotel's public spaces are quietly elegant and open to Hawaii's prevailing trade winds, meaning they are comfortable all day and all night, even during the height of summer. The rooms are clean, simply adorned, and very comfortable, and they are lit with warm-temperature lighting (thankfully!) and include a mini-fridge and a pod-style coffee-maker.

We reserved with breakfast included in our room rate, which worked very well. Breakfast is a high-end buffet affair, like a Hawaiian version of an Israeli breakfast, with abundant tropical fruit and some Asian-food options, plus plenty of good coffee or espresso drinks. All of this is offered in a Hawaii-style, open-air setting with a beautiful view of the tropical Pacific Ocean and Diamond Head. As an alternative, guests may enjoy a white-tablecloth breakfast at Orchids, another restaurant on the hotel grounds, and enjoy similar views. 

The hotel's Waikiki location means you have endless options for food and entertainment within an easy walk. My favorite was Big Wave Dave's surf shop, not a half block away, which serves good-quality latte drinks and some light food items (believe it or not). Across the street from Big Wave Dave's is an ABC Store - a Hawaiian version of Circle K or Seven-Eleven, but nicer inside and with abundant tourist items for sale - that offers inexpensive sushi, Korean food, salads, fruit and many other food items. It's a great place to stock up on snacks and drinks for the hotel room. With a big breakfast available as part of the room charge, a light lunch is just the thing so you won't be overloaded at dinner time. Each night of our stay we went out to dinner somewhere in Waikiki with family who live nearby. On a Friday night there was a jazz duo playing softly in a hotel bar, a great spot for a nightcap.

Overall, I am so happy I had the opportunity to stay at this classy, aesthetically pleasing, comfortable hotel with first-class service. I hope to get back soon.","Date of stay: August 2022","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The hotel still is as gorgeous.

Our connecting rooms were very well appointed, with great ocean views and offering a good night’s sleep.

The location is super and we loved jumping straight into the warm ocean for some water fun.

Had lovely drinks at the House without a Key (thanks Cenon) and later a lovely dinner at the same place.
Breakfast buffet was a little too basic (we had to pay additionally for some avocado - which unfortunately was not ripe).

Halekulani is all about service from the very swift check in/out, via the pool service up to Shun offering to pick up our lost luggage from HNL.

Bottled water is provided by the pool as well as the occasional morning snack, complimentary. We were able to get sun lounges everyday. We prefer staying at hotels that aren’t packed with guests and felt the ratio was correct here. We did have to ask a few times for water, a small thing if we are being picky. Perhaps guests could help themselves or maybe there could be a refill water station. 

The food was good; get the coconut cake from house without a key as well as the le mint drink. We dined at Orchids and La Mer and enjoyed it all.

The only area for improvement is the gym. There aren’t many free weights and the space is really small. We didn’t have what we needed so missed training for the week.

If you are staying near Outrigger Waikiki and looking for a scenic coastal walk, try walking on the beach towards the Royal Hawaiian Resort, then follow the coastline along the Sheraton Boardwalk, then the Halekulani Boardwalk where you can see turtles and takes you past the beautiful grounds of the Halekulani Hotel, then continue past Outrigger Reef Resort to Fort DeRussy Beach and past Hilton Hotel and lagoon.

It’s not the kind of pool that has loads of kids jumping in and out, it’s very adult. 
From the pool, there  is an entry gate, for guests only, to access the beach, which is quite a small section, however we found it perfect as it wasn’t overcrowded. 
It was easy to go between sun lounger by the pool, to a dip in the ocean. 
The restaurants and bars inside the hotel can also not be faulted. 
Hotel Staff are also a big part of your holiday experience and hotel rating. I can honestly say, each person we met or spoke to were all impeccable at their jobs. 
There is nightly entertainment, cultural & music, all were enjoyable and like the hotel staff, they really appeared to be happy to be a part of the Halekulani. 

If you are looking for a relaxing hotel for a couple, or a more adult hotel, close to all Waikiki has to offer, without a doubt the Halekulani should be your number one choice. 

We extended our stay and will be back!","Date of stay: March 2022","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I remember coming to the Halekulani starting in the 1970's. Struggling students without the means of being able to stay. We did take dinner at Orchids and continued to do so through time. Now being older and established and with kids and grandkids in tow, we stayed at the Halekulani and we were not disappointed. My offspring loved it and they said they are now spoiled and a new bar has been set with the Halekulani. Our rooms overlooked Diamond Head, the staff friendly, helpful and professional.

I love the attention to detail without feeling austere and stuffy.  And their commitment to friendly, accommodating service is very palpable and noticed.  Everyone from the bell hop upon arrival, front desk staff, pool staff, restaurant staff, concierge, phone operator, store clerks, and maid services were SOOO friendly. Their friendliness made the already beautiful and wonderful trip to Oahu even more joyful. I don't think it's simply because it's a 5-star hotel that is on the pricier end of the spectrum, because I have stayed at more expensive hotels which were much colder and less friendly.  I think that the Halekulani have made it a priority to treat their guests like honored family members and it shows.  I have traveled to many places around the globe and stayed at a variety of 5-star lauded hotels, but I will remember the Halekulani very fondly for the service that made me feel welcomed and appreciated. Other high end places made me feel unimportant and unappreciated. Thank you Halekulani.

As in the past, this hotel represents the definition of elegant luxury in its property and especially its service. Almost all of the most luxurious hotels offer refined service.  But at the Halekulani, the people there are truly the difference.  They seem to really enjoy what they do - and thus satisfy their guests every need.  Its the little things - no one says ""no"" to a request - they take care of it/make it happen even if it isn't their job.  For example, my first morning by the pool started very early, before the poolside service started.  I asked the attendant setting up my chair where I could go to get an iced tea, but she insisted on taking care of it and bringing me one.  Such a small thing - but I felt so appreciated.  And she seemed truly happy to do it.  There were at least 5 other ""small"" instances of this - which add up to one feeling genuinely at home and cared for.  That's the definition of hospitality in my book - and all too rare.  Halekulani means ""house befitting heaven."" Couldn't agree more.","Date of stay: May 2022","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

While it was definitely a splurge, i considered it as an investment in our mental & physical health. Mental bc this hotel is tucked away from the hustle & bustle of other Waikiki hotels & physical bc you have to walk a bit farther to get to the nightlife. Even then, the Halekulani is still at the center of Waikiki & it was a pleasure to stroll down the beach boardwalk & walkable streets to get to our desired locations. We stayed in rm 537, which had an oceanview to the right side of our balcony. It was heavenly. The bathroom was equipped with a Japanese toilet seat (bidet, heated), which was always a treat to settle into. Besides spending too much time in our luxurious bedroom & balcony, we lounged by the pool everyday & ventured to the beach right by the pool. The ocean was perfect & Halekulani def has the best beach property among all the hotels in spite of its smaller size—it’s more secluded & therefore romantic. Especially with Covid, staying away from strangers was important for us. We only left yesterday, & already, our hearts ache for the Halekulani. OH & I forgot to mention— definitely opt for the everyday breakfast deal, which gives you access to two of the hotel’s three highly rated restaurants. We ate at Orchids everyday except for our last day, we decided to try House without a Key. Also!! If you come to this hotel, highly recommend booking a sunset dinner at one of the restos (we would have done House without a Key if we knew better about La Mer, which was overrated to us.) they have live music from 5:30 to around 8! Sadly we spent this hour of time napping lol. Anyways, again, the Halekulani is a literal slice of heaven on earth. dont forget to tip the staff!!","Date of stay: May 2022","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

1. E-mailed the hotel in the morning (7am) of the check-in regarding room requests, did not receive an acknowledgement or response.
2. The lady that served us at the front desk was unprofessional. She seemed flustered and unsure of what she was doing and the check-in process was cumbersome. She also misspelled my name on the envelope handed to me.
3. Extremely poor experience with the pool attendants. When I requested for ""beach towels"" (which according to the facilities guide will be provided by the hotel), the pool attendants laughed while informing me that they only had ""towels"" but no ""beach towels"". They did so in a way that made us feel unwelcome and ridiculed. 
It is also the little things like the doormen continuing their conversation amongst themselves instead of greeting us when we passed by that made us wonder if the hotel was indeed a 5-star hotel. Will not recommend and will not return.","Date of stay: April 2022","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_20"

Understated and elegant. The rooms with ocean views not large. Desk and table are undersized.  Soaking tub in the room much appreciated. Amenities were nice. An interesting feature is that all bathrooms have bidets, including public rest rooms.  Lots of various kinds of outlets for electronics, well-placed.

The servers and staff at the House Without A Key are fantastic. Service there is wonderful and it’s lovely to sit out each evening and listen to Hawaiian music…with cocktails. However, cocktails seem to contain very little alcohol. They’re small, for one, but because I barely drink, I’m super-sensitive to alcohol—and not even the hint of a buzz. Like I’d had a soft drink. Given the prices, drinks really should be normal sized and contain an appropriate amount of spirits. Anything else is taking advantage of the customer.

While we were there, the cocktail bites menu was limited, as renovations were going on. What we did have was yummy but certainly not generously portioned for the price.

The food at Orchids is spectacularly good. Menus are limited, though, and no option for all-day dining. During our week there was variously no sea bass, no chicken and even no raisin toast. Some servers at Orchids were overbearing and rushed us, barely asking if they could pick up my plate before grabbing it while I was still chewing my last bite. No leisurely enjoyment of a meal here—they’re already bussing the table. This makes the meal feel hurried, a shame in this beautiful setting.

Room service prices are outrageous. Almost $40 for eggs and potatoes? Not even a meat. Less than half that at Orchids, so you are paying double for in- room. That’s gouging the customer by anyone’s standards.

Morning coffee service is available at Orchids at no cost. The biodegradable cups squeeze easily and therefore spilled the very hot coffee all over our legs.

The hotel setting in Waikiki is lovely and convenient and the staff is helpful.","Date of stay: March 2022","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The room (Ocean King Diamond Head View) was beautiful! The staff kept it fully stocked and any item used was replaced without asking before the end of the day (even the tissue box was refilled daily). The turn down service was so refreshing after a day of touring, shopping or just laying out at the pool! Every staff member we encountered greeted us with a welcoming smile and those who provided service truly made sure we were well taken care of. The concierge before we even arrived had made sure all reservations were made which made our stay so much more enjoyable! My only request is that the hotel not recommend the Star of Honolulu dinner cruise or at least add the disclaimer about the lower end service on the that cruise as it does not align with the service at Halekulani. 
Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Halekulani; the Sunday brunch (which was recommended and reserved by the concierge) was the absolute best! We will definitely be returning here. While Honolulu/Waikiki can be very busy/lots of tourists; Halekulani was like an island of its own once you entered the property.

There are many Kamaaina perks that Halekulani offered us - free parking and best of all, room upgrades if available.  Our upgrade to ocean view enhanced our experience as I spent a lot of time on the balcony enjoying the courtyard, the music and the beautiful ocean.  Our dining experiences at Orchids for dinner and also Sunday brunch were amazingly!  The room was top notch and room staff were always accommodating and extremely friendly.

The highlight of our stay was my sons wedding.  Sayaka and everyone involved were accommodating and helpful.  A staff member took us thru a short cut which avoided my elderly father and mother a longer walk from the Hau Terrace to the ballroom.  Our wedding and reception couldn’t have been any better. The food was great and service was amazing! 

I initially considered staying across the street at the Halepuna for a lower price,  but I am so glad I chose to stay at the Halekulani. My three day, two night experience was dreamlike.

It was quite busy as it was spring break time for many and people are finally able to travel again after COVID. I had a conference in the Ko Olina area and could not book all of our nights at the conference hotel as it was absolutely booked. So, we had to find other accommodations for half the trip.  By chance, I found Halekulani and booked that for the remaining days of our trip. What a wonderful experience. The customer service is amazing. From the moment we arrived to the moment we checked out, we felt absolutely appreciated and were treated like royalty. The rooms are beautiful and kept immaculate. Housekeeping always kept our room clean--twice a day! Pool side assistance was fast and helpful. They helped to set up chairs, umbrellas, towels, etc. Food and beverage service at the pool was also fast, personable and very helpful. The location of the hotel is perfect. There is so much to see and do in the area, all within walking distance. Valet parking was fast whenever we did want to drive out of the area. They always supplied us with water when we were leaving for our adventures of the day.

We booked Halekulani back in 2020 for a 2021 wedding but it got postponed due to covid & renovations. Through the whole delay & booking process Sayaka and others at Halekulani were very helpful & reassuring.  During the planning process Sayaka answered all of my many questions very quickly & thoroughly.  She made the planning a easy and painless. 

On our wedding day everything went smoothly. We had a buffet and all of our guests were commenting on how great the food was. Everyone loved it. As the wedding couple we were served by waiters who were very attentive. They made sure they knew our allergies / sensitivities and only brought us food that we could eat. We got a little bit of everything.  Then at the end of the night they packed us up a lot of food to take back to our hotel room. We had food for days in our hotel room! When we got back to our suit after the wedding there was a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries waiting for us. 

Our whole stay at the hotel the staff was very attentive to every need we had and they all seemed happy to help us. They upgraded our room so that we would have a suite with a roll in shower and that met all of our accessible needs. The porters also happily helped to push my husband in his wheelchair so I didn't have to do it. 

The one downside was that we had trouble connecting to their internet. Their in room tablet also couldn't connect so we couldn't look up the in room dining menu on their tablet. We had to use our cellular internet to go to their website and look it up. A small thing but it could be troublesome if you're trying to do work on your computer while there.

Food is good.  Service lovely- for adults.  This is NOT a place for children.  That was surprising given the family rate and rooms that are perfectly designed for families. No kid menu.  No laughing or play in only pool.  It is designated as a “serenity pool”- which would have been nice to know before coming with children.  Children are literally scolded for playing a mild game of Marco Polo.  And for laughing.  And for walking into restaurant from a paved entrance.  I heard one staff member refer to child guests as “hooligans” because they were sitting at a table in an open outdoor area that was - apparently - closed due to Covid.  It was not blocked off and looked to be a normal sitting area to look at the ocean.  One staff member apologized to us saying he had to talk to our children whenever anyone at the pool could hear their voices as it was a hotel policy.  He explained this was the least family friendly resort he’d ever worked.  I wish I’d known before booking.  I asked why it wasn’t designated “adults only”?  He didn’t know, but since it was well below capacity at spring break I’m guessing they’re looking for guests.  I hope they put appropriate disclaimers on their website and discontinue “family rooms/rates” as I don’t want any other families subjected to the treatment we had here.","Date of stay: March 2022","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_20"

This time with our kids (our first stay was 18 years ago).  In my review 18 years ago I noted how extraordinary the service was and that we had not stayed in a hotel with better service.  I can confirm that 18 years later, that statement is still true.  If possible, the service is even better (or maybe the service is the same but even more noticeable given the decline of service levels at other hotels).  It is incredible how serene the hotel grounds are when Waikiki Beach is steps away.  

Also, my only critique 18 years ago was that the rooms were looking tired and dated.  That criticism is no long relevant as they have done a tasteful renovation that makes the rooms modern with clean lines and different shades of white.  

We had connection rooms so the kids has their own room and the second room was at a discounted family rate.  

Few other notes: (i) the Sunday brunch is absolutely amazing - plan your stay so you are there on a Sunday, (ii) the kitchen at House Without a Key is not yet open due to a remodel so there is currently a limited, but well done menu, (iii) some stretches of the walkway on Waikiki Beach need to be restored which is disappointing, (iv) one suggestion is for there to be pillow options to help customize sleep and (v) another suggestion would be to have the concierge open longer than 10 am to 5 pm - for a hotel as dedicated to service as the Halekulani, this seems too limited in terms of availability.

Most importantly of all, it may be the only decent hotel in the entire island chain to still respect its guests enough to NOT run the despicable resort fee bait and switch scam.  

The facility is gorgeous and is one of the few hotels that actually took the time to provide aural insulation between rooms.  The rooms are spacious with plenty of storage space, a closet that is accessible from both the bedroom AND the restroom, and now include the glorious Toyo bidet toilets are actually…fun…

The pool area is adjacent the beach and has probably the most comfortable loungers on Waikiki.

Not all restaurant facilities were reopened yet due to the pandemic, but what was available at poolside was delicious and ably served.

Had an outstanding massage at SpaHalekulani, temporarily relocated to a hotel room while their facility undergoes its own refurbishment.

The staff is first rate, getting it done with style and panache…and verve and personality.

You will pay more to stay here, but boy is it worth it.  Besides it is imperative that the few remaining honest hoteliers (sadly an oxymoron these days) like Ulrich Krauer be patronized rather than his dishonest competition.","Date of stay: January 2022","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I have never been so impressed by a hotel. 

We live in Hawaii and wanted a romantic get away for my husband’s birthday. Our favorite restaurant is Orchids and we always dreamt of staying at this hotel one day. We decided to make that dream a reality for a one night stay. We had the most amazing experience and truly did not want to leave, so we extended our stay. We have stayed in many fine hotels around the world, and without a doubt, Halekulani is the most special. It’s a slice of Heaven. 

You feel like you have escaped the hustle  and bustle of Waikiki the moment you pull up to the hotel and enter its grounds. You immediately sense that this is going to be a special experience. You enter a tropical retreat with perfectly manicured grounds and attention to detail everywhere you look. The staff is simply incredible and they go above and beyond to make your stay extraordinary. We were greeted by front-desk staff who wished my husband a happy birthday and offered little perks to make it even more memorable. As we walked up to our room, we were taken aback by the gorgeous ocean views and the serenity in the atmosphere. 

Our room was immaculately furnished- smelled wonderful, the TV was set on relaxing music to greet us, and there was a bottle of champagne gifted to us by the hotel, as well as tropical fruit.  The hotel was recently renovated and it shows. We enjoyed sitting on the lanai and watching the ocean waves and the surfers. It was such a treat to sit on the relaxing chairs and sip coffee in the mornings. We were amazed how serene this hotel is. We have stayed in other Waikiki hotels and you are kept up late at night by party goers. Not here- this hotel is simply classy. Even little details such as no swimsuits or towels hanging on guests balconies to detract from the beauty. There is a sign that politely asks you to refrain from doing so, which I appreciated. That way I could focus on the ocean instead of looking at clothing items. 

The pool is spectacular and feels sophisticated- you will not find little kids cannon balling and splashing you here. There were a few families with kids but they were very respectful. The pool is heated, which was a nice feature. When you enter the pool, there is a staff member that asks you what kind of seats you want- if you want to stay in the sun or shade, face the ocean or garden area. They will walk around with you to find just the right spot and add wonderfully comfort chair covers and give you towels and bottled water. The cocktails by the pool were delicious, as was the food. Staff was just a wave away, and they made sure you had everything you needed. The beach in front of the hotel is quiet and beautiful, and mostly visited by hotel guests. 

Halekulani has the best restaurants in Oahu.
We had dinner at Orchids, which is always a treat! The most beautiful views of Diamond Head and you can catch a gorgeous sunset. The food is spectacular, and the desserts are so, so good. We have upcoming reservations at La Mer, and are so looking forward to it. It is known for simply the finest cuisine in Oahu.

Housekeeping staff was so friendly and helpful. Any time we needed them, they are were just a phone call away. They made sure that the room was truly spotless! 

We have stayed at many hotels in Hawaii, including the finest in Oahu, and trust me when I say that this experience does not compare. You do not want to stay anywhere else if you have sophisticated taste and only want the finest experience. Certainly no where else in Waikiki where you may encounter loud tourists. Halekulani is in a league of its own and we cannot wait to return! Mahalo to the staff for such a memorable stay.

The rooms are tasteful yet equipped with world class luxurious amenities guaranteed to satisfy even the most discerning taste. The location is absolutely perfect as an oasis right in the middle a major metropolitan city. But as with most of my evaluations it is the people that set the Halekulani apart. Warm, genuine, professional and friendly come to mind.  

I dined at Orchids three times, at the pool four times (maybe a few more beverages!!) and enjoyed cocktails at Lewers Lounge and House without a Key. The superior craftsmanship of the product and knowledgeable service is noticed and appreciated. 

One other thing that has become apparent to me while at the Halekulani. A very large percentage of the guests are return guests. Many that I met have been coming to the hotel for 30 - 40 years! I think it is fun to hear their stories and respect the hotel for understanding and perfecting the art of true service. 

So, if you have the opportunity you will not regret staying at the Halekulani and more likely than not you will make memories that will be cherished for a lifetime! And isn't that why we travel?","Date of stay: December 2021","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I just have a few additional items to share.

One, currently the pool service seems disorganized and is very slow.  The poolside servers are all very friendly, they just don't seem to be organized.  This is probably in part due to House without a Key being closed, thus all the cocktails and food are coming from another location on the property.  So be aware that service at the pool is not at the level that is should be, and it can take a LONG time to get a drink or food.

Second, the pool was pretty chilly, and some guests were complaining.  This might be ok during the summer, but it could have been heated more for this time of year.

Finally, just so all can be aware, the Halekulani does not have any jacuzzi's around the pool.  It's not really a big deal, however it seems a little odd, and it would have been nice to have some with the slightly cooler evening December weather.  Most nice properties in Oahu or on any of the islands do have jacuzzis,  from the Kahala, to Four Seasons, Fairmonts, etc. etc.  Thus it just is a little strange that the Halekulani has opted to not have this poolside amenity.

Other than the above items, a great stay.","Date of stay: December 2021","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Pros:  The hotel is beautiful and we came when they had Christmas decor. The staff are very friendly. We booked ocean view therefore had a great view of the water and Diamond Head. The room came with nice amenities. My husband got a kick out of the toilet because as soon as he stepped in, the lid would automatically open and the seat was also heated.

Cons:  On our 1st night, we ordered room service. We had poke and it seemed warm to me and only ate a couple bites. My husband ate more and in the morning he woke up feeling ill from food poisoning. Mine wasn’t as severe but it ruined our first night as we didn’t leave the room until about evening to step out and get soup. The plus is that at least we had a beautiful view. The only other complaint is that for a 5 star hotel, I would’ve expected the bathroom floors to be nicer. It looks like cheap white tiles with ugly color grout. 

Despite the food poisoning and the bathroom, I would stay here again.","Date of stay: December 2021","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Balcony afforded a wonderful view of the ocean and we actually spent quite a bit of time on the lounge chair or table for 2 there. At night, Hawaiian music (live at the Room without a Key) could be pleasantly heard from there as well. We ate several dinners, 1 breakfast and 1 lunch at their on site Orchids Restaurant.

We spent 8 days here and found it to be beyond fantastic! We got a Ocean Front King and loved it! Though 'ocean front' is a little off, the room and its view were fabulous. The rooms were just all redone and though I don't know what they were like, our room was fabulous! The staff was very attentive! (Kudos specifically to Mr. Hernadez at the Conceirge desk!!) The pool was paradise! Not crowded and generally quiet. (Though I heard later that the travellers were down 50%) I have a difficult time relaxing....anywhere....yet I had zero issues letting it all go for the 8 days. The GM did make an appearance a few times around the pool which I had never really experienced before! Nightly entertainment was nice as well. If I were to give any negatives....they could use another server or two at the pool. Maybe some explaination of all the buttons you have in your room for us that are 'challenged'.

We are back for the first time in three years and after the hotel has been closed for almost two years for renovation.  We are staying in room 1561. We are very disappointed!
Some positive changes have been made to the rooms including new paper on the walls and new carpet, and also new outlets by the bed. That's about it !
The air conditioning system appears to have been  redone but it makes noise, there is no way to have quiet cold air in the room, even when on low your hear a significant noise.
The toilets have been replaced by japanese style toilets: they are tiny and when you sit on them you permanently have to fight for balance . They are very uncomfortable !
Breakfast used to be served at The House without a Key and it was possible to enjoy  the magnificent views of the Ocean and Diamond Head from the terrace  while eating . The buffet was opulent with lots of choices. Now breakfast is served in a black hole overviewing the patio. The buffet is about one fourth of what it used to be, it is very basic : eggs , sausages, potatoes, a few pancakes, pineapple , cantelope and a bowl on the table with two croissants and one muffin ! No more exotic fruits , no more cheeses , cold cuts  etc  no more all the delicious  things which made  breakfast at Halekulani a feast ! We called the front desk to ask until what time it was possible to have breakfast and were answered 9:30 am. We rushed and when we arrived  a signed said that it was open until 10:30 am .  The information given to us was wrong .  When we asked for a table the attendant on duty  very abruptly said that we had to wait 20 minutes , that they were full and that no table was available ! The other employees in charge of serving food were as abrupt ! Absolutely no courtesy ! It is even possible to say they were rude .  The location is awful compared to  the location before (terrace with ocean and diamond head views).
All together  the Halekulani is now providing the level of service of a Hyatt or a Hilton, but still charges Halekulani prices at close to 1000 dollars a night! Something is wrong here !  If this is going to be their new standards then we will be better off at Hyatt or Hilton  next time !","Date of stay: November 2021","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_20"

What a special memory my husband and I have of our 25th wedding anniversary.  I overheard someone at the pool say when she stays at the Halekulani, she feels like a princess.  I must agree.  First class service and a beautiful atmosphere, understated elegance-sublime.  I enjoy the marvelous floral arrangements all throughout the property too.  We ate at Orchids for breakfast and dinner and each meal seemed like a special occasion.  The food is beautifully prepared, fresh, delicious and the service is excellent.  The attention to detail is divine.  For example, they use a green water glass (at Orchids) and when set on the table against the background of the foliage and the blue ocean, along with the orchids in a vase, the table itself looks like it could be in a portrait.   We had  drinks and appetizers one night at House Without a Key.   It is always a treat to listen to the live music and watch the hula dancer in front of the famous kiawe tree and ocean.  We enjoyed lunch/drinks at the pool too. I think our mai tais arrived in record time (and very tasty too-always love the fresh squeezed juice).

Highlights:
-- Beautiful and extremely comfortable recently refurbished rooms. Loved the loveseat and coffee maker. Note that Toto toilets have been installed, if that's your thing.
-- Outstanding location in the middle of Waikiki.
-- Chill vibe, despite location in the middle of the action.
-- Gorgeous pool, and on a (very small) beach.
-- Outstanding service. It's clear that they were able to rehire long-time staff, despite the lengthy closure for renovations.
-- Excellent food and drink. Make sure to have their Mai Tai.

Caveats:
-- We were there when the hotel wasn't that busy. We never had to wait for anything. I don't know what it would be like when the hotel is full.
-- Pool closes at 5 pm! The staff is reasonable about letting people continue to hang around, but still . . .

Room tip:
-- We booked an ocean view room. We ended up with a particularly good one, which gave us a partial view of Diamond Head and a reasonable view of the nightly performance at House Without A Key. If we went there again, we would consider booking a Diamond Head view room, so that we could be sure of the same view.","Date of stay: October 2021","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Tring to get a drink after 5pm was impossible unless you were seated at the outdoor restaurant but unfortunately we went at 5:15 and they told us there was a 2 hour wait...there should be at least an outdoor bar available for guests.

Worth the wait. Rooms are similar color scheme as before yet refreshed. Loved the addition of the Nespresso machine, a/c worked MUCH better, wi-fi was fast before but now it zooms. Personal choice, I don't like the Toto toilets but this is all part of an upgrade with the remodel. All the staff are 5*. Sadly, during our stay, House Without A Key was still closed so meals poolside and breakfast buffet were in Orchids - no hardship, the setting beachfront is so beautiful. Limited menu but that is to be expected during these times of Covid recovery. The hotel registered us as Covid verified when we first arrived so we didn't have to bother showing our cards + ID again when being seated. A very nice touch but that's all a part of the 5* service at this hotel. 
This is an expensive hotel but not out of line with other 5* properties and so worth the $ if your budge permits. Very special place, we are repeat guests, can't wait to return next year for a family milestone birthday party on Hau Terrace.

I feel that the front desk service is impersonal, reserve and cold. They will get what you want upon asking but they won’t be reaching out to do above and beyond like the experience at other luxury hotels. We are celebrating our anniversary and I did send a message to them earlier in the email and no one replied.  This is the first time I sent an email to any hotel and they totally just be quiet and ignore it. Upon checking in, no acknowledgment of our anniversary, and no  welcome back and no special of message in the room, except a preprinted general welcome message from the manager. They made me feel  they didn’t really care about our important anniversary. I had to go mention this to them at front desk and no apology, they just later on sent us a bottle of champagne with another preprinted general card..

The staff did mention to us themselves that the hotel is at its slow time due to the virus outbreak so if we were considered one of their valuable guests, I would think they could have been more attentive.

We pay astronomical price for the hotel and this is not the service level that is on par with other luxury hotels we have visited all around the world.","Date of stay: February 2020","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

Waikiki is not a favorite destination, but we decided to book a fairly last minute stay during President's Day week and made a return visit to the Halekulani.

We booked thru AMEX Fine Hotels and Resorts program, got a great rate with an upgraded hotel room, included breakfast daily, and $100 credit. The Halekulani delivered on all of the program promises - and offered early check in and 4pm check out which we our flight schedules didn't require.

The Halekulani is located right in the heart of Waikiki on the beach - it is a block from Lewers street, if you walk two blocks down Lewers you find yourself at Tiffany & Company (the heart of Waikiki shopping). More practically, it is one block from an ABC store with an expansive deli, a gelato shop, Hawaiian Cookie Company, and a Starbucks. Longs Drugs is also very close by.

Our room was great - 6th floor, partial ocean view. At the Halekulani, partial ocean view means you get a great view of the ocean from the balcony not the room. But it is a fabulous view of the beach and ocean, not the tops of trees like in other places we have stayed. The room was spacious, well maintained, and had a great bathroom. 

The staff was to a person, very friendly and helpful. When they noticed we drank a lot of the complementary bottled water, they stocked our room with extra bottles. The fridge was for our use, not some minibar with ridiculous prices. Housekeeping did a very thorough job cleaning our room.

We did not use the gym - we are both runners and found an amazing running route - start at the Army museum just 1 block from the hotel, run along the beachwalk past the Hilton lagoon, then enter the Ala Moana park. Inside the park, 1.7 miles from the Halekulani front drive, is a 0.6 well marked loop that includes the waterfront part of the park - you can do as many loops as you want before returning back to the hotel. The scenery is gorgeous, if you go early in the morning, you can watch the sunrise along with the many surfers.

The large pool was beautiful. There are many lounge chairs around the pool and on the lawn between the hotel and the pool. Unlike other places that sometimes puts you on a waiting list, we had no problem getting choice spots and the majority of the chairs remained empty. The hotel was sold out during President's Day week, so I assume most of the guests had tours or other Hawaii adventures to do. I found myself being the only person in the pool much of the time. The only negative thing I have to say in this whole review was the lack of a jacuzzi/hot tub. Not much to say, the front desk staff says it was a common comment. It seems like there was plenty of space to put it in the middle of all the chairs. 

You can exit the hotel grounds and go down to Waikiki beach, although the sandy area directly in front of the hotel is pretty small so most people walked either direction for more sandy areas.

The House without a Key buffet breakfast daily was fabulous, and I would encourage people to consider packages including this $93 daily value (for two people). Both American and Japanese dishes were found in addition to the great fruit. They did rotate several of the dishes during the week. You can always count on the omelette bar, waffles, rice, bacon, oatmeal, fruit, yogurt, cereal but also find a wide variety of rotating foods like sausages, egg dishes, etc. Guests also can eat at Orchids and pick a complete breakfast if they prefer traditional service.

Of course a stay at the Halekulani wouldn't be complete without a Sunday Brunch at Orchids! After hiking up Diamond head, we enjoyed views of it from our table at the Orchids brunch.

I have been to Waikiki for work over the last 20 years and wanted to experience the Halekulani during this work trip. Check-in was first class and the view from my room to the ocean was amazing. My room is very quiet and the cleaning staff is 5-star. The room is nicely appointed as well and the balcony has furniture to rest and look out at the ocean. While the hallways and carpet are traveled/stained and dated, I realize you are not here in Waikiki to rate the carpet and paint but the service of the hotel. Where it went wrong for me was when I walked to the Orchid restaurant for breakfast and I simply asked that I would like to be seated for breakfast and then they told me it was for brunch only...then I said ok, can I be seated for brunch and then another older staff lady began to ask me if I had the breakfast package which I told her I didn't and would be more than happy to pay for breakfast if they would have me. Then they asked me if I was a hotel guest which I told them I was and my room number when I walked up which caused another delay of conferencing which I politely told them I would go find something else (as other people were walking up and being promptly seated). Then I walked around the corner to the restaurant: House without a Key which was about 15 people deep for a line (which I waited). After getting to the hostess, same drill: name, room #, then you wait again. After about 30 minutes of waiting (total about 45 minutes), I decided to take my chances out in town. Same day I came back and decided to go to the pool and lay out and get some drinks...only after sitting for 30 minutes I politely waved to a pool waiter which apparently he did not like as I got 1 order in and after almost 90 minutes he never came back once to ask me if I wanted something else (he took pains to avoid me serving other guests around me). I guess this all seems ""very"" trivial but I really wanted to feel the friendly and welcome experience at the Halekulani (since this was a solo work trip for me) at $700 plus a night. I have stayed at 5 Star Resorts and Hotels and this is not it (except for the views!!! those are 6 Stars!!!). There were a couple of other minor things but overall, when you are advertising as one of the top hotels in Waikiki...this definitely falls short compared to other equally priced or even lesser hotels I have stayed in Waikiki. I think if you know the staff or you are a local, this is the place to be but not sure I or my wife and kids will ever try to book and stay here again and tbut instead, try some of the other hotels down the road. As a last note, I will say some of the staff are extremely nice and were very friendly but because there are so many options so close to the Halekulani, I really don't care to give the restaurants, spa or pool any more of my business.","Date of stay: January 2020","Trip type: Traveled on business","ui_bubble_rating bubble_20"

It deserves its rating as it's well located with excellent unassuming service and good food.
We were here over the second and third weeks of January, whilst it was cloudy with some rain at times, it was still warm enough to swim and linger in the ocean. Surf was mild.
We stayed in an Ocean Front room which overlooked the pool area and gave us box seats to the stunning ocean sunsets and let the lazy sounds of the lilting Hawaiian music from the daily evening performances waft up to our balcony. Sounds kitsch, but very relaxing...
When we could be bothered leaving the pool area (with its excellent service) for the beach, I would recommend turning right after stepping onto the beach at the front of the hotel and walking for 2 minutes to the Fort DeRussy Beach Park rather than turning left to Waikiki Beach, as it has more atmosphere and is less crowded with a more local population.
So relaxing was it, that there were a couple of days where we hardly left the property at all, except to get coffee.
My only qualm was the staff at Orchids seemed to take themselves a bit too seriously and unhelpful, but that was easily mitigated by dining at the relaxed and informal House without a Key, one of the many nearby off-property restaurants or utilising in-room dining which was very good.
We would happily come back to stay here and highly recommend this property for a family holiday in Waikiki.","Date of stay: January 2020","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I had read some fairly negative reviews on TripAdvisor so I was not quite sure what to expect but honestly, if this hotel does not make you happy, then nothing will. The property is beautiful, gracious and understated. Landscaping and flowers are beautiful and the floral arrangements within the hotel are stunning. The staff is lovely—professional, courteous and helpful. And they remember your name! Housekeeping (twice a day) is excellent. Room service was prompt and everything we ordered on three different days was cooked perfectly and delicious. The restaurants are also excellent and service is seamless. If you book a stay here, do add on the breakfast package which is well-worth the cost as is requesting an ocean front room. The hotel’s beach is minuscule and yes, the pool is small, but the pool is lovely and the pool attendants are very nice and helpful. And the hotel is so well located that you can walk out the door and be in the heart of all the first-class shopping and stores. The complimentary tours available through the concierge desk are outstanding and worth the time. And your room key card provides free admission to many Honolulu attractions.

A friend recommended the Halekulani and we are so glad they did! In general Waikiki is much more of a city atmosphere than other parts of Hawaii and the Halekulani does a great job of merging the city vibe with the tropical paradise. Our room  (561)had a great view of the the shore and Diamond Head, the kids were on the 10th floor with less view but a larger room (1052) Both rooms were comfortable and meticulously maintained. The hotel is older and the decor is somewhat dated but the finishes are high end and spotless so it was charming and not an issue. The hotel is well located, one the far end of the beach so a little out of the very busy area. There really isn't much of a beach and no beach loungers offered. If you are looking to relax on a pristine tropical beach then Waikiki is probably not the spot for you anyway. The pool area had plenty of space on cushy loungers. Didn't use the spa but fitness area was good and had a nice view. The best things were the evening options. The sunset bar (can't remember the name) has a hula show featuring Kanoe Miller who was Miss Hawaii which was very fun, good back up musicians and good entertainment value, a little different flavor than hula I have seen before, we really enjoyed it. The hostess at lunch said she would reserve us a table and she sure did us right, we had a great seat. Even got to meet Axl Rose that night as he was there. Then we went over to the jazz club and got the second great show of the night. Felt like I was somehow in NYC and Hawaii at the same time, such fun. We also had a drink (shoulda had dinner!) at La Mer Restaurant. Such a beautiful space and the cocktails were so over the top. All this and you can walk to all the shops and attractions of Waikiki. The staff were universally excellent. Can't imagine a better place to stay in Waikiki.","Date of stay: December 2019","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Sixth visit, but I can’t see myself coming back due to front desk lack of service!!","When one is returning to a hotel after many visits one could expect a warmer welcome than the one we received on our recent visit to the Halekulani on Waikiki!!!

When we presented at reception Naomi didn’t even welcome us back, didn’t even smile at us she just demanded our passports and to know who would be sleeping in each room!! We were then told our rooms wouldn’t be available until 3pm! 

It was 9am!! We wandered the hotel and fell asleep on a reception couch due to jet lag. A kind bell boy told us there was a hospitality room (which turned out to be the business centre) which we found our way to and again fell asleep. The reception called our mobile at approximately 2pm to say one of our rooms was ready. What a terrible start to a very expensive holiday and so disrespectful of our loyalty to the hotel and the huge business we have given them over the years. The hotel couldn’t even put our rooms on the same floor! I actually can’t quite believe the lack of service, but it is a complete failure for the hotel and one they should frankly be ashamed of!! The front desk staff seem very caught up in their own self importance  and have lost sight of what they are there to do and that is to make guests feel welcome! We felt most unwelcome and therefore I find it hard to proceed in giving the hotel any praise!

I will give a few comments as to what worked well for us once we calmed down from such a horrible commencement!

The pool food staff are delightful and the food and drinks are good around the pool as is the room service!

House Without a Key is still good, but the breakfasts have diminished in quality somewhat. The food used to be immaculate, but unfortunately it’s a little disappointing now and they are cramming too many people into the restaurant at night so it doesn’t feel exclusive anymore. 

Orchids is still good and we had a lovely meal in Le Mer and enjoyed the entertainment in Lewers.

The spa is still a relaxing experience, but seems a little tired! The whole resort needs and upgrade as even though it is beautifully maintained it is looking quite tired. Don’t be fooled that the sister hotel Halepuna that they have built behind them is equivalent quality. It’s not on the beach and has more of an executive feel to it!

Thank God the Halekulani Cake is still perfect or otherwise I would be truly crying in my cups!!

They have a programme for return guests, but they only started recognising that a day or two in and this means you receive a little amenity at night with the turndown service!

I’m left with one image of my stay! When I excitedly asked Naomi at the front desk if she could tell me from the computer what number visit this was for us she said she wouldn’t be able to tell me from the computer! Well how ridiculous is this!!! She didn’t care!!! In fact we felt like the hotel didn’t care at all!!

For starters, the location on the edge of noisy Waikiki is absolutely prime, offering a bit of respite from the incessant commercial wasteland outside. The atmosphere here is unmatched in Waikiki. Furthermore, the service is top notch, particularly the housekeeping staff who made sure the beds were always in tip-top shape. Food options were also great here, including tasty options for all three meals. Unfortunately, the pool and beach areas leave a little to be desired, as the pool is consistently overcrowded and the beach is minuscule.

How fortunate we were to experience a stay here. The service was what really made it so special. From the moment we stepped into the hotel the service was exceptional. Actually, probably from the moment I booked a room over the telephone and spoke to someone at the hotel who could advise me of a room and rate to exactly suit my needs, this holiday was going to be a success. 
We had a large, well maintained modern room with a generous sitting area, good bathroom with large shower and lovely views. Having stayed at other hotels in Waikiki the understated elegance of Halekulani really sets it apart. The housekeeping was also exceptional, I have only experienced a similar turndown in some of the very best European hotels. 
We ate at House Without a Key and Orchids and both were great in terms of food and service. One serves a buffet breakfast and the other a la carte. 
The pool was very pleasant and the service there very good as well although I must admit we didn't spend much time lying around as there is so much to see and do on Oahu.

We love the sun and the water. Therefore we search for a nice heated pool, front beach location and quality service.
The front beach exposure is minimal. So if you are a beach lover this is not the place for you.
Also the hotel could use some major renovations to maintain their luxury resort status. The rooms are extremely small and there is no wall between the room and the bathroom, just a double door closet, which we found very uncomfortable.
The pool is undersize to service the hotel capacity, they do not have any kids pool and can get loud at times.
Besides the fact that the pool is small, we just learned that they RESERVE the best sun exposure seats and seats with tables for their premier rooms which they only have 3 of those rooms. 
They do not disclose this information on the website. If we would've been aware we would've book one of those rooms or stay somewhere else.
The dining options are very limited as well and you will not find a large variety on the menus of their restaurants. And lastly the service overall it’s very poor and the staff is acting like they are above you or pretty much doing you a favor for anything you ask to be assisted with.
Lastly we did not appreciate the rudeness of the staff, including their manager Frank Pullay, while explaining their internal rules and telling us it’s nothing he can do about it.

Overall I would say the staff and service is very good, however that’s not enough to warrant a 5star luxury resort status.
The hotel rooms are in need of a major facelift, especially the bathroom. The bed was uncomfortable, we asked for a mattress topper and instead of a down topper got a foam egg crate thing that was a slight improvement.
The pool is sub par for a hotel of this category and size. Only one pool!! No kids pool?? No jacuzzi.
Of course there were lot’s of kids and noise and not very relaxing.
But the most disappointing was the tiny beach area which is over run by the catamarans that come and go through out the day. They come right up on the beach and have lines coming off them in the water making it difficult to swim for fear of getting choked,
not to mention the motor smell. Swimmers and people on the beach have to move out of the way every time they come and go....very annoying indeed.
We heard people say they’ve been returning to the Halekulani for years, maybe the mgmt. is satisfied with the same return customers, I’d say they are complacent.

This is not a 5-star hotel, and not comparable to any random Four Seasons in any way whatsoever.

First, the good

- Orchids has a decent breakfast (the service was slow and poor, though it improved after we complained)
- The staff were all really nice and are doing their best to make up for a hotel that needs considerable renovation (especially the guest rooms)
- We dined at all 3 restaurants (La Mer, House without a Key, and Orchids), they all have amazing views and the location is hard to beat

The bad

- We had an ocean facing standard king room - the bed was super uncomfortable and hard, perhaps the worst hotel bed I've ever slept in (I usually spend 30-40 nights per year in 5-star hotel rooms)
- The bathroom was subpar, the tub was tiny and worn out, overall worse than most 3 or 4-star Marriott or Hilton bathrooms; the shower was straight out of an 80s Miami condo, could barely fit one person it was so small
- The pool is small and the overall pool area is small, although the service at the pool is decent
- The location is supposed to be good, but access to Waikiki beach was cut off while we were there, which made it extremely inconvenient to actually get to the beach","Date of stay: November 2019","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_20"

All other 5 star hotels/resorts are measured using the Halekulani as a yardstick. Put decor, amenities, food and location aside for the moment. What you left with is the people who work at the hotel/resort that you staying at. Any traveller reading this review will NOT find a hotel/resort with staff that are as caring, helpful and proud of their work as the staff at Halekulani. The four seasons and ritz Carlton come close (and I have stayed at both) but just fall short of the impression that the Halekulani makes on you. 
A GIGANTIC HUG to Kyle, Carlos and Alfredo at the poolside service who truly made me and wife feel like family. You guys are the best!

Hawaiian music/ singer is played most evenings at HouseWNKey so you can sit around and have a drink and that can also be heard at the other restaurants also if you are dining on the property.

Everything could not have gone better. 
Except for the rundown, (compared to how it was in the past 20 years), Hotel Halekulani, and their unorganized service and ungracious 
attitudes. The long time locals in lower positions are the most kind and helpful people with their genuine “Aloha Spirit” we all come for! The upper staff never showed any Aloha Spirit at all. That is really 
too bad and a shame because after all these years we really can’t see ourselves staying there until some serious changes and renovations are done. 
We will be much happier at The Royal Hawaiian or even at The Ritz.

I had been seeking a quiet week away from a hectic personal/business life & wanted someplace that would offer entertainment & dining,etc. & beach so that I could dip into any/all if I felt like....or not.
Right from the moment of arrival where a group of outdoor bellboys greeted the Taxi & open doors,took bags,etc. & asked my name...which I learned later was so that they could precheck me in by sending a runner to the front desk, so that by the time I arrived at the Desk I was passed my Key & was escorted to my Room by one of the Desk staff...in which my luggage was already in place. This set the tone for a perfect week of idleness during which the staff seemed to intuit my needs,including not a noise or intrusion until Noon.
There was of course,a perfect slice of beach with Cabanas,etc. & a large outdoor Pool area &  outdoor Dining with nightly classic Hawaiian Hapa Haole or old school musical Hawaiian Trio, as well as alternative  upscale indoor Dining options.

We chose not to eat often in the hotel as there are so many other choices in Waikiki.  The only negative, in my view, is the buffet breakfast - just not a huge amount of choice compared to the normal US breakfast buffets I have had before.  BUT, that didn’t detract from a lovely peaceful hotel.

I must also identify one outstanding member of the Halekulani family who made us feel we are in Paradise.  That's Mr. Francisco Hernandez, Chef Concierge of the Halekulani hotel.  He is a good man and he really looked after me and my family and made sure that we are having fun (by assisting us organize activities and adventures trips ) as well as finding dinner tables at top restaurants in such a short notice.  

Mr. Francisco made us feel like royalty and we thank him from his kind care and assistance .

He is one of the good people behind this Paradise called Halekulani.  

The hotel it self is a Piece of Art.  The hotel have it's own Luau every evening between 5 and 8 pm with the best Mai tai drink in the island.  Signature Jazz bar and amazing food.  There is so much to do in the hotel that we didn't have to go out of it. 

The hotel is amazing in every way (entertainment, food, recreation, staff and especially the Concierge of the hotel ). I recommend anybody once they check-in to go directly to the Concierge because they are a wealth of information and so helpful. 

All the best and love to the staff of the Halekulani hotel and especially Mr. Francisco Hernandez Chef Concierge for making our vacation so fun and memorable.

It has a sort of old-world colonial charm, a bit like Raffles in Singapore, but very much in the 21st century as well.  Exceptional service, good position on the beach and near Kalakaua Avenue, lovely pool, and a wonderful atmosphere in the evenings when everyone gathers on the terrace for cocktails and live music.  The thing that made it totally perfect for me was the blissful absence of any pop music playing on speakers at the pool - something that ruins so many hotels these days.  At certain times of the day they had a live group playing Hawaiian music, but that's fine.   

The only very slight suggestions that I would make would be to have coffee-making facilities in the rooms, and to get rid of those daft electronic toilets that spray water at your nether regions when you are least expecting it... but I could probably do with less caffeine anyway, and we solved the toilet problem by unplugging it!","Date of stay: August 2019","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

My hubby and I had planned to stay at another hotel and when we arrived at that hotel we were very disappointed.  We had stayed in Hawaii 2 years prior and had visited the Halekulani for dinner. We walked there on a hope and a prayer they would have a room available. 
By the time we reached the hotel we were so hot and uncomfortable not to mentioned stressed about what our holiday was going to end up like if we couldn't get a room here. Lea met us with a huge warm smile and listened to my dilemma. 
Within 5 minutes we had a room booked for five nights and it would be ready in an hour!!!
That's amazing service. Lea offered us water and a place to sit so we could take the long walk back to the other hotel that we had decided to cancel.
From that moment on to now , I can confidently say this is the best hotel in all of Waikiki.  The location, the facilities,  the pool area and service. The food is amazing,  the cocktails are amazing but most importantly the team are incredible 
Lea is an asset to the hotel and I hope she gets the recognition she honestly deserves. Her customer service was above and beyond and our room was simply stunning 
Vanessa at concierge was absolutely delightful to deal with. Nothing was a problem. All the team are great however these 2 ladies were a stand out.
I want to mention all the little things that make it worth laying a bit more to stay here.
Free water in our room and also around the pool
Free snacks around the pool from mini muffins to ice blocks
Free gifts with every turn down service at night
Free coffee to go in the morning
Staff that are very knowledgeable and helpful to plan trips and tours for you 
Free wifi
A choice of a la carte breakfast or buffet (we had this included in our package)
3 restaurants that are absolutely incredible
Lewers lounge bar (see my review on this)
Oh and free sunscreen.
Before we arrived at Waikiki we had a week at the 4 seasons on Maui and the service and quality at the Halekulani definitely gave it a run for its money!!!!

Fantastic beaches and great to watch the sun set. Each evening at 5.30 they have Hawaiian dancers and music which is fantastic! 

Make sure you ask the concierge the best places to visit, they are very informative and knowledgeable, especially Vanessa-thank you!

We decided to return to Waikiki in 2019. It was a bit of roll of the dice flying all the way from the East Coast hoping to recreate the magic we felt from our first visit. We were not disappointed. We loved our ocean view room and while the Sheraton noise was evident, it did not bother me that much. 

The staff is amazing - so warm and welcoming. We felt as though we were leaving family a tthe end of our 10 day trip. We loved the back fo the house tour with Melba. She is a gem as well.

What i find so fascinating is how insanely busy Waikiki is - but we love that vibe! Yet we turn the corner for the hotel and instant silence.  It is the best of both worlds. I feel as though I am in a private beach retreat and then step outside for the excitement of the city.

We loved room service. It was very elegant. We dined at House without a key as well as Sunday Brunch at Orchids. Both outstanding as well. From the quiet grounds to the immaculate rooms, it was delightful.

The beach access is lacking, which doesn't bother me tooooo much. But the catamrans can be a little frustrating. We did rent a car a few days to explore the island and found larger quieter beaches to visit and swim.

The pool attendants were great as well - you never have a problem finding a chair.
Just a luxurious stay YET AGAIN. Highly recommend. We did a split stay LAST year between Halekulani and Aulani. NO comparison. Hence staying put for 10 nights in Halekulani!","Date of stay: July 2019","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

But we didn’t expect to enjoy the Halekulani as much as we did. Every aspect of their service was absolutely first class, from the check in where we were given a tour of the hotel facilities to incredible poolside setting where we spent many hours enjoying the Waikiki sunshine. We dined at every hotel restaurant except Le Mar which we will try next time but Orchids and House without a Key were brilliant. The concierge service was just so satisfying, in particular Dee Dee who assisted and suggested everything to do during our stay and was spot on with all that she recommended.
We had our teenage kids with us in an adjoining room and the rooms were just faultless, cleaned thoroughly everyday by polite and courteous staff while the different lovely gift each night after the turndown service was a thoughtful touch.
Lastly, what I really loved most about Halekulani was its long history and tradition  in hospitality in Waikiki which shows in everything they do at the hotel, something that a lot of the big chain hotels can’t match.
We loved it and will be returning one day soon without a doubt.","Date of stay: July 2019","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Though very familiar with Hawaii as an adult, this was our first trip with our teens, and the concierge was very helpful about how to make it a great trip for all of us, including what may not be in the best financial interests of the hotel. The concierge was knowledgeable (of course) and exceptionally helpful and generous. 

Pros: The hotel is a spectacular oasis in the midst of bustling, commercial Waikiki. If Waikiki is where you want/need to be for adult time, this hotel is unparalleled. Beautiful public spaces and rooms, great food, great concierge. Perfect for a business trip in the area.

Challenge: It’s not a great hotel for children and teens (which might actually be a plus for business travelers).

Everyone has gone out of their way to provide the ultimate service not to mention the beautiful ocean front room 1408 we were assigned on checkin. Unfortunately due to the overbearing Sheraton hotel at extremely close proximity to our room it became untenable for us to venture onto our balcony due to the unrelenting noise from the jackhammers they were using to renovate their rooms 
Popped down to reception to see if we could be relocated to a quieter room and even though the hotel is about 95% occupied they managed to relocate us for the duration of our stay in a magnificent Diamond Head Premium Ocean Front room 1065. As we are LHW members our significant upgrade was complimentary,
Sensational views but would have also been v happy with our previous room had the noise from the Sheraton not been an issue.
For hotel buffs like me it’s worth doing the back of house tour with Aunty Melbourne who btw is turning 90 next week. Gives you a real insight into the running of every dept of the hotel. They don’t outsource anything 
I was always curious to check out the Royal Hawaiian’s Malani Tower ocean view rooms and I can categorically tell you they don’t come near the spaciousness and luxury of the Halekulani rooms imho. The amenities are topnotch here

Really lovely balcony to enjoy reading or lounging outside. 

The only minus point is the quality of amenities in the room. For a hotel with this rate, you just expect a lot more. There isn’t water, tea, water boiler, minibar... provided. Nothing in the toiletries area either. You have to call for absolute everything... of course they don’t mind, but it’s not really the standard anymore to have to inquire at this room rate. The equipments are old and there isn’t a standing shower. Both of us almost tripped getting in and out of the bath tub. The control for air con is hidden in the closet. Overall - lots of getting used to if you are more familiar with modern hotels. 

However, if I have to choose 1 improvement point that would help improve the quality of the stay, it would be the linen.","Date of stay: July 2019","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

The location was perfect for us, easy walk to downtown and central Waikiki but still less crowded and chaotic compared to the other hotels. The staff & service in every area of this hotel were superb but a special thanks goes to the pool staff, housekeeping staff and the staff at House Without a Key. 
Our package included breakfast and the HWK staff greeted us so warmly every morning at and every night the turn down service was so lovely.
The staff at the pool could not do enough for you and the pool service/management/security was both wonderful and appreciated. Plenty of loungers, towels, water, not fighting for space and the pool is the nicest pool in Waikiki for sure! It was easy to get to the beach too.
Our room was so clean and comfortable we had a partial view of the ocean (don't assume you will get the upgrade as promised it was so busy so there was no chance) but it was still a fantastic view, just sitting on Lanai or lying in bed and hearing the waves was perfect !
Also, from what I have read I think the rooms were a really good size for Waikiki hotels and our room was lovely and clean with a calming décor.
The beach whilst small was warm and not crowded and currently there is no access to the main public beach but normally you would just walk along the Sheraton boardwalk to access the main public beach. 
The construction at the Sheraton was a bit noisy so be aware of this as it will be going for a while yet and did cause us some disruption to the tranquil nature of the resort.
The only negative comment I would make is the lack of environmental policy & practices. For example, they encourage you to re-use towels but there is really no-where to hang them to dry, there are new small bottles of multiple products every day and the toilet does not have a dual flush. I would encourage the hotel management to revisit their policy in this regard as there was a lot of waste. The other big negative for us was the lack of tea/coffee facilities in the room. There was also a lot of weddings at this hotel, it didn't interfere with out stay at all but just good to know.
In summary the good - the staff, the pool, the food, the location, the room.
In summary the not so good - the construction noise, the lack of environmental consideration.","Date of stay: June 2019","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Pampered and Relaxed","We got married on the Hau Terrace at the Halekulani Hotel and we stayed here for 3 days. I cannot say enough about how exceptional everything was. 
Wedding: The setting was perfect, the food was fantastic, the Mai Tai’s were potent and service was outstanding. There were leftovers from the cocktail hour and they packed up some food for us so we could have some late night snacks.
Room: We upgraded to a Junior Ocean suite and it was beyond expectations. The view of Diamond Head and the Ocean was breathtaking. The bed is super comfortable and we would often sleep with the windows open and shutters closed to hear the ocean waves. The suite was perfect for getting ready on the wedding day. All the thoughtful little things made this hotel stand out above the rest. Fruit plate upon arrival. Complimentary water and Coola sunscreen. Charger cord organizer, bookmarks, L’Occitane hand lotion and more! It was great to have a walk in closet with ample room and extra drawers. 
Hotel: The hotel grounds are beautiful and well spaced. The pool area was very peaceful and relaxing. When you visit the attendant for your towels, they help you pick your spot and they have fitted lounge chair towels. I visited the Spa and it was also super relaxing and peaceful. A great way to chill out before wedding day. 
Food: Halekulani has a great reputation for their food and it did not disappoint. We had great meals at House Without a Key, by the pool (get the fries!!) ordered room service and of course the food at our wedding - everything was outstanding. All the staff who helped to organize our rehearsal, reception and after party gatherings were so helpful. Thanks to Pamela, Darrell, Keith and Joel. We had the help of our amazing wedding planner, Gina and her team, from Perfection International. 
Service: Exceptional!!!! From the moment we handed our luggage to the valet team, to check in, to being escorted to our suite, room service, housekeeping, pool, spa, restaurant and banquet service - this is what differentiated our stay. They truly are focused on outstanding and memorable service and it shows. 
Yes, it is a splurge to stay here but if you can indulge, you will never forget it and you will feel pampered, taken care of and relaxed.","Date of stay: May 2019","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

From Jane the beautiful haired woman who checked us in - to the 2 men reclaiming a king bed out of two singles (who knew) who were ever pleasant and watching the warriors game with us; all the staff in the restuarants.  The staff are professionals - and smile regularly - they are not some high school or college kids ""getting through"" their job.  It makes a huge difference when you need a vacation and are treated like they are actually happy you are there.  The restaurants do everything to accommodate your food menu changes or requests.  The Pool staff put up with your moving chairs and needing towels, etc. etc.  While yes- the beach is small - its perfect for soaking in the ocean - the turquoise water is like a healing magnet for the body.

We came here as a staycation prior to moving from the island :'(

We always heard about it and ate there for dinner, but never stayed. I have to say, the rumors we're true, this is one of the best places to stay and other resorts should visit and take notes. From the very beginning of coming in to leaving, we we're always greeted with smiles from everyone, and somehow, everyone knew our names (really creepy). When we came, the property wasn't modernly renovated (and to date, I don't know if it is), but the property was well maintained, rooms and service was perfect. We love our morning papaya in the room. It's hard to describe, but this place exudes a non-pretentious and sincere class in the most humbling way.  It's no wonder why most Japanese tourist prefer that hotel. It is pricier than most on the strip, but if you are fortunate enough to afford it, I'd say splurge and go for it.

Location - You couldn't get more breathtaking views or be any closer to the beach. You can leave the pool area to go for a dip in the ocean, then come back and lie on your lounger. I noticed that other hotels allowed people who weren't guests to roam inside the foyer/pool area, take photos etc. They don't allow this at Halakulani which makes it really peaceful and away from the hustle and bustle of the main Waikiki street.

Food - Everything is great, quite a few different restaurants to choose from. My only comment would be the breakfast buffet could have a few more options including the bread. 

I wanted to address that everyone is saying this hotel is dated, I can understand that if BUT if you appreciate the history of this hotel and how they want to preserve the 'Hawaiianess' you understand why it looks how it is. You can't compare this hotel to a fancy four seasons or Ritz Carlton, the design is completely different. Everything seems to have a story which is really nice. The gardens and landscaping are stunning and I'm going to mention the views again because it really is a postcard of Waikiki with the Diamond Head backdrop.","Date of stay: April 2019","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

First impression 5/5: Unassuming facade leading up to a beautiful, well-maintained garden ground.  It's a hidden peaceful paradise tucked away in busy Waikiki.  Front desk was extremely helpful and welcoming.  

Room 3/5:  We stayed at the Ocean Front room on the 7th floor.
The good:  Unbeatable ocean view.  Comfortable bed and quality sheets.  Surprisingly good connectivity with plugs and recharge station.
The bad:  The room size was on the small side compared to similar category @Trump or Ritz just a few blocks away.  The furniture and set up were clean, well-maintained, but inevitably dated.  The same applies to the bathroom-small with only one sink. 

Services 5/5:  Warm and personal.  Compliments to Jane and her thoughtful gesture.  My partner had a last minute job interview via FaceTime only 3 hours after our red-eye flight from Sydney to Honolulu.  I casually mentioned this to Jane when we abruptly excused ourselves from her tour of hotel ground after check-in.  We were then surprised with a warmly written ""good luck with your interview"" card delivered to our room, along with a bottle of wine and a fruit and cheese plate.  It really made my partner's day. 

Amenities 4/5:  It has all the bare essentials-a practical gym and a reasonable pool that was always busy.  It doesn't have a private beach but does have a direct access door to the beach.  There was nightly Hawaiian music and traditional Hula dancing by the pool-side restaurant.  It can be enjoyed just as well from privacy of our balcony.  It does have a top notch restaurant La Mer-it's another review but the food, service, and the view were simply divine.

Bottom line:
Pros:  Centrally located within minutes walk to all the shops and beach. Excellent guest services.  Unbeatable million dollar ocean view.
Cons:  Rooms are smaller, and the building is well-maintained yet dated.","Date of stay: April 2019","Trip type: Traveled on business","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The hotel's location keeps it away from the tourist madness; the setting is beautiful and serene.  Our room was lovely, with soothing colors and everything we wanted or needed.  Since the bed was too firm for us, a mattress topper was delivered just an hour after our request:  that's service!  Housekeeping was excellent, and we enjoyed bird-watching from our lanai.  We had an upgrade to an ocean-front room, which was at the back of the garden/pool area; we spent a lot of time just sitting on the lanai and looking at the ocean.  Restaurants were pricey but of very high quality; La Mer is the equal of anything in Paris (the chef is from France), and the Sunday brunch at Orchids was phenomenal:  the buffet to end all buffets, with a mountain of food options.  Jazz by a piano/saxophone duo at the Lewers Bar was a pleasant interlude  .We enjoyed watching several Japanese weddings, with the brides in lovely gowns and the women guests in beautiful, stylish dresses.

I can't imagine a better hotel; the only comparisons would be the Williamsburg Inn and the La Perouse in Nice, France.  If you can splurge, this is the place to stay.","Date of stay: April 2019","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Just came back from a vacation with my wife for our anniversary. Had to switch rooms because the first one smelled like smoke. To their credit we were given a great room as a replacement. Top notch!

The food is excellent but it’s very pricey and they aren’t really looking out for the customer. At breakfast juice is $8 a small glass no refills. But I guess it’s to be expected at a high end place like this. I just don’t like that 

The other big negative is that they have almost no beach. It’s a tiny little strip of sand. If you want to lay on the beach you will need to go down further and rent an umbrella.

The prices are outrageous. We were in a Diamond Head Oceanfront room, which I made the mistake of looking to see how much the rate is. The carpet was fairly dirty and the furnishings look like something Blanche Devereaux would of called ""perfectly lovely"" in 1987. For the rate you're paying, you would think that at least rubber slippers (flip flops) would be provided for going to the pool and beach, but no. The two things we needed, an iron/ironing board and toothbrush, weren't in the room. When my husband called for them, whoever answered the phone said ""Hello, Mr. & Mrs. ______"" to which my husband replied ""It's actually Mr. & Mr. ______"". They had both of our names assigned to our room so they should of known better. I believe another reviewer made mention of being called by her boyfriend's last name, how outdated that is, and I absolutely agree. The Do Not Disturb light didn't work, which I didn't bother to inform anyone about, because we were staying only one night and I thought reception would notify housekeeping when we checked out, but lo and behold at 8:30 in the morning while we were sleeping, housekeeping was ringing our doorbell. By the time I had gotten to the door she had already left and shouted ""Sorry! I come back later!"".

The bathroom: who puts an area rug in a bathroom in the tropics?!! I could almost see the mold and bacteria taunting me. The shower stall is tiny and doesn't have exactly a rainfall shower head.....a sideways drizzle shower head? Whatever it was, the water pressure was bad. The toilet looked like it was from 1956. The bath towels were just slightly larger than hand towels. As mentioned before, dental kits aren't provided and need to be requested. They don't have any dental floss/flossers. There was something called ""Washing Suds"". Washing for what? Were they bath salts, maybe? I don't know.

The hallways were small and had low ceilings with an exhaust system from some restaurant pointed at them leaving them smelling like hamburgers at times. They were also incredibly bland. I've seen nicer, more inviting hallways at Best Westerns. The staff are nice. That's it. Nice. They seem to have a not-always-hidden disdain for any non-guests on the property. 

I don't want to make it sound like everything was terrible. I think the closet that can be accessed from both the bedroom and bathroom is clever, and the bed is extremely comfortable but it doesn't really matter WHEN HOUSEKEEPING IS WAKING YOU UP AT 8:30 IN THE MORNING BECAUSE NO ONE CAN SIMPLY CHECK TO MAKE SURE THE DO NOT DISTURB LIGHT WORKS BEFORE LETTING A GUEST STAY IN THE ROOM.

The room we were in starts, starts, at $780. That is insane. Everything should be flawless for that price. Instead, everything seemed to be filled with flaws. As we were walking down the stairs to go to Lewers Street, my husband asked me where I would recommend for someone to stay to have an amazing experience in Honolulu. I replied ""Ummmmmm......Tahiti?"".","Date of stay: March 2019","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_20"

While we were there just after CNY, the hotel was going through one of it's most busiest period and the entire hotel was full. Despite being at maximum capacity, the hotel was lively, busy, beautiful and well kept to Hawaiian standards. There aren't many hotel options if you want a beachfront location in Waikiki. Halekulani has a small but very important spot on the beach. Every day you can see pristine ocean to the horizon, Diamond head crater to the left and Waikiki sunsets on the right. Yes the hotel is old, it's dated, it's colonial, it's also pretty expensive, but the cleanliness from the maids and service provided all around the hotel including at the pool, the Halekulani was well worth it. It's the very small things like giving us a small bottle of Waikiki sand on arrival, rich L'occataine hand moisturizer and choclates every evening. The concierge and the reception are all very professional, the bus boys too were super quick to attend and weren't pushy with the tips. One downside is due to the dead end by the hotel entrance, valet car service can take a while during peak hours.

As much as I love this hotel, there is room for improvement. You can get more for your money elsewhere in the world. But as for on O'ahu, not really.

The high price of the rooms here (circa $700++ for an Ocean Front) would be totally acceptable if the hotel was delivering a true five star experience but unfortunately you leave wondering just how different the Sheraton or Westin could possibly be at half the price.

I just couldn't shake the feeling that while this hotel is considered very good by Waikiki standards it falls well short of the benchmark for an excellent five star hotel anywhere else. 

The major reason for this is that Halekulani battles against the almost insurmountable fact that the hotel is clearly in need of HUGE amounts of money being spent on it. The rooms, corridors and public areas are all decidedly worn out and aren't really anywhere near the quality of what travellers have come to expect in a five star hotel.

We chose Halekulani because we had heard many times over the years that it was one of the world's great hotels and were curious to see for ourselves but it seems that these days are now long in the past.

This is not a failing on the part of the staff in any way (who were all excellent), it's just the cold hard reality that you can't deliver a genuine 5-star experience without facilities to match.

Is Halekulani the best hotel in Waikiki? The answer is quite possibly still yes but sadly I think that reflects more on the generally poor state of the available hotel offerings than on the hotel itself. 

A hotel can't survive forever on past reputation alone (even without local competition) so I hope that in the not too distant future something is done to bring this hotel back up to world class. I would love the hotel owners to spend a night in an Aman Hotel or a Rosewood Resort (or even a new Four Seasons) to see what customers expect these days at that price point.","Date of stay: March 2018","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

Housekeeping is ever pleasant and efficient. No room amenity is neglected, and immaculate care each day is guaranteed. Requests are attended to immediately & always with a smile. The conscierge is right now finding the diffuser aroma in the welcome area to answer my request to purchase it! The restaurants reflect the same attention and care. Breakfast has many varied choices making each morning a new adventure. Outdoor lunch at the House Without a Key is peaceful and plentiful, offering light fare and more substantial meals. One of my favorites is the vegetable sandwich- both simple and satisfying. I recommend afternoon tea, even if not part of one’s usual routine. It seems that each person who works at Halekulani is determined to make the guests smile. Dinner at Le Mer is like dining in Paris with the added ambience of the tropical Pacific setting. The chef’s daily creations should not be overlooked; his emphasis on sophisticated fish appetizers and the selection of entrees reflect creativity and his appreciation for exotic enhancements to what might otherwise be ordinary. A simple scallop appetizer can’t be described - just order it!
 I couldn’t continue with all the details, because there are so many unique surprises- flowers, art work, the gorgeous wood features, the view....

I was very much looking forward to the stay and I was not disappointed.

It's important to understand expectations for the hotel market in Waikiki, as it's different than other islands and certainly other cities. Waikiki is dense, busy, noisy and congested. I happen to enjoy that vibe but it influences hotel options. 

The Halekulani has somehow found a way to be both in the middle of everything, and feel removed from most of it. It's quiet. It's mellow. It's calm. The views are amazing.

The pool is hands down the best hotel pool in the city. It's much larger than it might appear in photos and, quite remarkably, never crowded on our trip. I've been to the hotel in the past during high occupancy seasons (holidays) and also don't recall it ever being crowded. 

Breakfast is plentiful and fresh.

Service is consistent and friendly.

Location cannot be beat.

It really lives up to expectations, provided you've got an accurate understanding of the market.

My only disappointment (which was rather a black mark on our stay) was the hotel pool closed mysteriously on our last full day and did not reopen until the following morning. I was on my balcony about to head down for a swim when I saw them closing it up. I inquired why and was told various forms of ""we had to shock the pool."" I don't know precisely the reason. I had seen children in the pool just prior to it closing, and don't know if an accident took place. Nevertheless I will presume they did so with our best interests in mind. To their credit, that evening a letter was included with turndown service offering an apology.

My only challenge now is to justify the room rates at the hotel for my next trip. I'm quite looking forward to it, regardless.","Date of stay: January 2019","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Waikiki to Kona to see a range of the beautiful place that is Hawaii.  I like Waikiki a lot, but it can be a bit of a tourist haven, and is always bustling, and we wanted a little more calm.  This hotel came highly recommended by a friend so we tried it.  Excellent advice, and a nearly perfect stay.  The decor and ambience is a bit Eastern, presumably to cater to visiting Asian tourists, and it is just excellent.  Understated elegance, much quieter than it's surrounding, and with the most excellent service.  Our room was on a high floor with a beautiful view of Diamond Head.  The service was literally perfection.  Everyone is friendly, no one is pushy and they are all very knowledgeable.  There is a spa, but we didn't have time to visit.  We spent a lot of time at the pool and at a few bars.  It is central to Waikiki so everything around is a nice walk.  Concierge is top notch.  The room was unbelievable - comfortable, quiet, well appointed, and beautifully kept.

The Pool area was amazing and the pool attendants helpful and friendly.  Easy access to the beach, although the section of beach out the front of the Halekulani is choppy.
The rooms were a good size but felt a little dated.  The bathroom was very nice however the shower recess was super small.
It was nice having a balcony and sitting area outside.
We had breakfast one morning a ‘house without a key’ and it was okay, but nothing to rave about, we probably would have been better off ordering al la carte.  
Given the size of the resort it was surprisingly quiet, and you could always get a good seat at the pool.  Overall we thoroughly enjoyed the hotel and the atmosphere, location is great, however the rooms could be modernised a little.

We heard so much about this hotel. We had wanted to give the Halekulani a try to see what the hubbub was all about,  we usually stay in another hotel along Waikiki Beach which is about  half the cost of Halekulani.

Rooms: The rooms are clean but BORING - they are not luxury at all as expected; and when you factor in the price point they are not worthy of the price. The hotel feels like a big box, the bathrooms are small and cramped, the bedding is seriously average - or below. Check in was uptight and disengaged. Just going through the motions. The food was ok and I forget the name, but one of the restaurants had a jacket requirement - are you serious? The landscaping was nice and well maintained. However, there's no beach access or maybe it was closed - all very confusing.

The hotel is beautiful and it's located on the famous Waikiki beach. Despite the hustle and bustle of the area, the Halekulani Hotel has managed to keep the hotel private and secluded; so, it's like a little piece of heaven in a very busy area.

What stands out most about the hotel is the service. My wife and I have stayed at a lot of great hotels throughout the years, and the Halekulani Hotel is probably the best for service. The Four Seasons is right up there too, but the Halekulani is just really good at making you feel welcome at every ""touch"" point. Where other hotels would miss the mark somewhere (front desk, bell desk, restaurant, etc.), Halekulani was amazing in every area. 

My wife and I were ""wowed"" by the Halekulani Hotel and my wife is really nit picky so this is a great compliment to the hotel.

Much to our delight, we got right into our well appointed ocean front room to rest. Water was then dropped off. Donna checked us in and was so welcoming and brought us to our room.

After resting, we had a delicious lunch at Room without a Key. Yes, the pool is crowded and there is not much of a beach  but I think that is expected in Waikiki. We lounged by the pool and visited the friendly gift shop. 

The concierges were very helpful and made reservations for us at a delicious dinner.

The turn down service was gorgeous with a beautiful quote snd L’occitane hand cream.

We had wanted to try it for a while to see what all the fuss was about, as we typically stay in another hotel along Waikiki Beach which runs roughly half the cost of Halekulani.

Rooms:     The rooms are clean with decent storage and on the smaller side, but the beds/linens are not luxury at all as expected; they are of pretty poor quality for this price point. The bathrooms have a single, very crowded sink, tiny shower stall, large useless tub, and a large carpet/rug that is probably not cleaned very effectively between guests.

Service:     Service at the pool was usually miss over hit. The pool desk wasn't manned for some time. After waiting around for a while, we just got our own towels and immediately were swarmed by someone out of nowhere demanding our name and room number. Getting drinks and/or food was a bit of a chasedown both for ordering and getting the bill. The hosts/hostesses at House without a Key were friendly and warm at breakfast each day. On our last evening we inquired about a late checkout availability the next day as a perk of our package and we were asked by the front desk person if we were staying there? She then tried to give us a price list for the hotel for some reason...then we asked about the use of the hospitality suite and she said we can only use if we are staying here. Our mistake I guess for asking another question after the first debacle but there was no one else working the desk to talk to, so we finally just left the front desk shaking our heads and wondering if it was a language barrier problem. We returned the morning of checkout to a larger, more helpful staff to get our questions answered.

Grounds:     The grounds are beautiful and well-maintained. There is no beach and no walkway (it was closed, not sure if permanent) so you must walk through the Sheraton property to access the beach. The hospitality suite was nice.

We could hear striking workers from the nearby Marriott properties every day. The best thing we can say about Halekulani was that thankfully we weren't staying at one of the striking properties.

Bottom line: High cost but little to show for it. We won't be returning to stay, but may return for a meal here and there. 2.75 stars.","Date of stay: October 2018","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

In the middle of a concrete jungle it may be but this hotel is a gem. It has a real soul which is clearly embedded into all the great people working there. It has real class without being pretentious. We were upgraded to an  ocean front room on arrival. Upon checking our passports, the receptionist immediately noticed it had been my wife's birthday the day before. Within hours a complimentary bottle of champagne was delivered to our room. The in house restaurants were all highly rated on Tripadvisor and they all deserved such recognition. If you get an invitation to the weekly Manager's Cocktail Party, don't miss it. The canapés were high quality. The pool area by the beach is very relaxing and well serviced with regular complimentary nibbles brought round to all the guests. These small touches just added to the 5 day stay. A very special hotel in our opinion.","Date of stay: November 2018","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

For a slightly higher price per night, we decided to move to Halekulani at the last minute. Best decision ever!  From the moment we got out of the car, we were welcomed by a hostess who escorted us to reception. We were greeted by name at reception and with Happy Anniversary wishes. Check in was a breeze and we were given a personal tour of the property by Wayne who then escorted us to our room where he showed us around and pointed out all the incredible amenities and details to make our stay as comfortable as possible. The rooms are so well thought out. It was exactly what we expected from a premium hotel in Hawaii and what we hoped the resort we stayed at earlier in the trip would be. 

Everything was great from the pool, pool service, coffee, decor, housekeeping, ice and bottled water in our room, and more. Just lovely and we cannot wait to return.  

The only down side is that there is not a beach set up here. We were excited to chill at the famous Waikiki Beach but were disappointed to find out the property doesn’t have a beach area with chairs and umbrellas for relaxing all day long. Luckily they do have an area to get in the ocean but if you want to lounge on a chair, that’s done at the pool which is a super brief walk through a gate. 

Thanks Halekulani for making our trip to Oahu extra special. We can’t stop telling our friends about it!","Date of stay: November 2018","Trip type: Traveled with friends","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Paying homage to old Hawaii in both style and preservation of culture, the Halekulani helps share the Hawaiian culture in their ambrosial meals at 5-star restaurants such as House Without a Key and others, spa treatments, and various amenities found throughout. The Aloha spirit lives on in their staff and facility!

THE KEY CARD
Not only does this (almost) magical key card grant access to your room, pool, to and from the beach, it also grants access to many other things outside of the hotel. Halekulani has created a ""For You, Everything"" program for guests which essentially means complimentary admission to other attractions such as the historical Iolani Palace and Bishop Museum to name a couple.

FOOD
For lunch, we visited House Without a Key and tasted their glorious Key Lime Pie.

**Try their secret, Calabash Curry dish!!

It's a great twist to spam and curry! Yes, you heard that right, spam. We love that the chefs at Halekulani create signature dishes! It sounds odd, but it all mixed well together. 

Their Calabash Curry is a limited item on the menu at House Without a Key. Once it's off the regular menu, it'll be put on the secret menu. It can still be ordered once, just for those who know about the dish!","Date of stay: September 2018","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Good location. It had nice pool, good restaurants. The staff were nice and helpful. 

However we had a very bad experience with the concierge staff. We traveled with an electrical wheelchair. One of the staff ( her name was Rena I believe) at concierge booked a boat trip with Star of Honolulu. We were told it would be a bus pick up at a place called Landing which was about 10min walking from the hotel. The boat would leave at 5:30 pm and come back at 7:30pm. On the day of trip, I told the gentleman working at the concierge that we rented a mobility van but we were not sure about the parking. Bus pick up would not suitable for us neither ( it proved my thoughts after the event when we saw a long long queue by the bus). I asked him to call a mobility van for us. He was very impatient when I asked how long would it take for the van to come.  He simply answered "" 2 to 3 minutes"". We waited at the front more than 15 minutes (it was 5:15pm) when another man came to offer help. I told him we were waiting for a mobility van. He went to check with the concierge guy and came back saying the guy didn't call a mobility van for us. He said we could either reschedule or cancel it. I told him that we didn't have time to reschedule it. We would drive our van there. He said he would call the boat to wait. I was very angry and went back to the concierge guy while we were waiting for our van brought out from the car park. I said his behavior was not acceptable and would talk to his supervisor. A guy came out from the back and claimed he was the supervisor and asked what happened. I said I didn't have time to talk to him then and would like to talk to him later. There was nobody called me by the time we left the hotel and never heard anything so far...

A disappointment was that both restaurants now only offer buffet breakfast (apart from option to order from 4 items at Room without a Key). The a la carte breakfast at Orchids was a highlight last time we stayed, but I found the buffet option disappointing. Birds were also everywhere as people left their tables with food on them.

While I had a good time at the Halekulani, the level of service and attention to detail did not come close to watch I experienced at Four Seasons (Maui) and St. Regis (Kauai) from the moment we arrived.  When our Uber dropped us off at the hotel around 1pm, the bellhop/porter just grabbed our luggage without a smile or greeting and gave them to the next person who was to take them up to our room.  We were expecting him to introduce us to the next person who would take us to the concierge; however, he just walked away and no one approached us, so we hunted around to locate the concierge ourselves.  Similarly, one of the pool guys displayed a similar attitude – when we asked him for beach towels, he did not crack a smile and gave us a look like, what do you want.  These two employees made us feel like were imposing on them by asking them to do their jobs – this is not something you should feel from any service professional, but it’s something I’m willing to overlook at a cheaper hotel.  For a five star hotel, this inconsistency in service is unacceptable.  

The pool itself is nothing to write home about in my opinion.  Super crowded, tons of kids, not that big (wouldn't necessarily blame the hotel for any of the above; I realize you're working with limited space in Waikiki and kids are kids).  Umbrella seats are limited.  Guests will throw down towels and personal items and then walk away for hours and the pool staff doesn’t do anything about this; at the Four Seasons, you have a 1-1.5 hour grace period before the pool staff will remove your belongings for the next guest to use, but at the Halekulani it seems you can leave your stuff all day without anyone saying anything.  In fact, one umbrella simply had folded towels on the chairs and when we inquired about that seat, we were told that it was reserved for guests in the executive suite.  Well, we hung out by the pool all day and four hours later, these guests still hadn’t shown up.  At the Four Seasons, guests can pay more to reserve a cabana, but seats aren’t just given away because of your suite status.  This seems fairer to me.  Also, I don’t think this would have bugged me as much if these people actually showed up.  

The room was pretty good.  We had a partial ocean view room and the view was pretty incredible.  The bed was comfy and the tub, relaxing.  The rooms feel light and airy; I appreciate the white aesthetic vs brown wood paneling and dark colors other hotels often use.  The little gifts they give you each night during turn down service were cute and fun.  The maids leave the gifts on your doorknob if the privacy sign is activated; however, turn down service times were inconsistent and often times our room did not get serviced.  

The majority of the people who helped us during our stay were lovely.  Pool guys Tom and John, Nicole at the concierge desk, Alfredo and Bree from the pool waitstaff, Josh at House without a Key, and Charlie from room service, to name a few, really stood out to us.  These people were super friendly and helpful and really seemed to care that the guests have a good experience.  There were many others whose names I forgot such as the bellhop who brought our luggage to our room and all the bellhops who helped us on our way out (it’s too bad they weren’t working when we checked in).  Also, House Without a Key is a great restaurant.  Breathtaking views of the sunset, great food, incredible desserts.  We ate here almost every night and truly enjoyed ourselves.  Sunday brunch at Orchids was lit, as the kids say, and the buffet each morning at both Orchids and House without a Key was pretty great as well.  We definitely were not hurting for food options during this trip.

The last thing that irked me is not an issue specific to Halekulani but one that most five star resorts should work on IMO:  They kept calling me by my boyfriend’s last name.  Mrs _____.  Clearly the staff are advised to call us Mr. & Mrs., so I don’t fault them for this mistake, but I think this should stop.  I realize it’s an attempt at formality in a five star resort, but that’s ruined when you don’t get my name right.  I'd rather be called ma'am or Miss than by the wrong last name.  It’s a little silly to assume that all couples are married and that all women take their husband’s last name.  Even weirder because when we checked in, I was asked to provide ID, so my name was in the system.  This isn’t a big issue in the grand scheme of things, but after being called someone else’s name for a week, you feel ready to return home to your real identity again, lol.

Overall, I had a great trip and Hawaii as a whole was beautiful.  Again, the majority of these ""issues"" would be non-issues in a regular hotel, but I think are worth addressing when extra money is paid for luxury and service in a five star hotel.  We feel very fortunate to have taken such a lovely trip but I do think the the bar needs to be raised for this place.","Date of stay: October 2018","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

During the trip from the airport to the hotel, the driver explains the various buildings, businesses, etc.  The ride is very smooth and driven with utmost care of the passengers.  

Upon arriving at the Halekulani, the guest is cared for by a host of employees - each one has a specific duty such as help the guest out of the limo,, remove luggage, confirm room accommodation, and guide the guest to check in.  The guide waits and then shows the guest to its room.  

At the room, the suitcases are properly placed and then the guest is shown every aspect of the room, including the phone and how to use the safe.  After the Bellman leaves, one gets a feeling of home and that no question is too small.  The Manager of Guest Experiences is always ready to help.

Mr. Michael Okamoto, the reservation manager emailed us earlier to warn about the upcoming hurricane. There were no earlier return flights available to go back to LA (in fact, there were no tickets available for any direct flights to anywhere in the USA because  of the hurricane danger). We ended up staying at Halekulani waiting for our original flight for two nights, as initially planned. It was a great stay under such uneasy circumstances.

We didn't know what to expect and were in a bit of a panic upon our arrival to halekulani. Everyone at the front desk was calm, polite and extremely helpful. It immediately put as at ease. The check in into our suite was very smooth. We stayed at the 1 bedroom suite on the 7th floor, facing the diamond head. The ocean was literally under our balcony! There was a handwritten welcoming note from the hotel manager and some yummy snacks for us and milk with cooking for my daughter. The suite was meticulously clean, very bright and spacious. 

The following day there was a hurricane preparation at the hotel (moving the balcony furniture indoors, securing doors and windows with cardboard and sand bags). The restaurant was moved to the higher floor. I was impressed with how smooth the hotel staff worked together as a team. The laundry, room service, restaurants, concierge- everything worked with no interruption. 

There were sirens on our second night and an advisory not to leave the hotel room after 5 pm.  The hotel representative came to our room in person to make sure we were in the house and comfortable. There was also a large screen installed in the lobby with the updates on the hurricane status, in addition to the multiple notes sent to the rooms from the manager. We all felt comfortable and most of all safe.

In the morning of our planned departure, Mr. Okamoto called us to make sure our flight wasn't cancelled and we will be departing as planned. Mr. Mark from the front desk walked us to our car and gave my daughter a lovely toy. It made her day! Thank you Halekulani for taking such a great care of your guests.

Booked diamond head ocean front, but the ocean front view is ocean side view... we asked for ocean front but they explained that their ocean front was for diamond head and not ocean front for the sea. In my country (Brazil) ocean front is when you see the ocean in front of you, nothing obstructing your view.. look the pictures.that show our view.....A very nice manager Leah (thanks darling) offered us an suite (for 1000,US, more) but as we were in 5; 2 adults and 3 kids we decided to stay in the rooms that we had booked and accept the view that we had.. I think the rooms are dated. An ugly carpet In the room entrance... old closet, old bathroom... it was the only hotel in Hawai (being in four seasons in Kailua Kona, and four seasons in Maui) that not  welcome us with  an Lei or offered some water as we arrived. It’s a hotel when guests are always remembered to dress properly... for me that travel a lot, it’s strange that a hotel that asks for at least U$ 700,00 per night, need to remember their guests to dress properly even in the common areas.. they should know that their guests know how to dress properly... they had lots of Japaneses in the hotel during our stay. Don’t think that they need to remember the Japanese guests to dress properly either... 

Room service: one night I ordered a hot dog with French fries for my daughter (in their menu it’s said that their dog comes with  French fries). It was ok, but the room service attendant said: French fries? Today is ok, but tomorrow you can’t order hot dog with French fries.. I just asked why, and she answered: that s because tomorrow we will change our menu and we are not serving more French fries... really? You are a five star hotel or not? Why the guest need to worry about that even not asking for anything? How could she assume that in the next day I will order agaiin? I just left four seasons in Maui and one night one of my kids want a bowl of popcorn. I asked the room service attendant if she could help me and she answered: we don’t have it in the menu, but I can arrange that.. so Halekulani, read this review and learn something about customer satisfaction with your colleagues at four seasons... 

Didn’t eat there but have heard that their restaurants are amazing.. their location is 10.. overall they have nice people working there but they need training focused in guest satisfaction. 

It’s true they gave us a discount because of the ocean front view that was said in our reservation, but in fact it was an ocean view, so thanks again to Leah.

From the moment you arrive and are given a half hour personalized tour of the facilities and your room, you know that this is something special.
Very hard to fault this hotel, in fact there is nothing I can think of that we were unhappy about.
We had a partial ocean view room 512 which overlooked the pool area and beach directly in front of the hotel.
Its the little things that make the stay special, like the complementary icecreams they bring around to the pool area, the little lanyards that they offer for your room key when you are swimming in the sea plus special towels you can take out to the beach.

Also during a set breakfast at Orchids restaurant (you get a choice of 2 restaurants) I was presented with a little birthday cake with my name on it which was a nice touch.
The concierge also organised a reservation at Alan Wongs on my birthday night. 

Great location as well with its own little beach away from the crowds of Waikiki, and an ABC shop just across the road, as is a nice restaurant (Roys) and a top notch bar and grill next door.

If you can afford it stay here, chances are you wont be disappointed.","Date of stay: August 2018","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We stayed in many great and up scale hotels around the world and Halekulani will definitely be, from now on, our hotel of choice every time we will come back to Honolulu. Everything is absolutely thought with great taste and with every little details to please the eyes.
 
We had the chance to celebrate our 10th year wedding anniversary at Halekulani and the staff attended to all our needs and always with a beautiful smile. Nothing was too much bother. The lady who was attending to our suite must have noticed my husband second pair of glasses because when we came back to the room after shopping, there was a cute little bag containing a complete cleaning/screwdriver set for glasses! Talk about caring for your guests !

We highly recommend stopping at the Lewers Lounge for a bite and/or simply to listen to the very talented musicians, who again, get out of their ways to please the patrons.  The food at House without a key is also absolutely delicious with great service!

Halekulani is committed to make their guests feel welcome and they succeed in every way !  We cannot thank them enough for having made our anniversary so unforgettable!","Date of stay: August 2018","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

It’s location is fabulous- the pool area is lovely and, whilst busy wasn’t overcrowded or unpleasant. The beach area is very small but Hawaii is not short of public beaches and so this was not a problem for us. 
Breakfast was a huge range of foods mostly Asian and continental with fresh omelettes cooked to order. The fruit and the fresh juices were divine. All food at the hotel is expensive but comparable to other restaurants in the area.

I didn't expect to have a room straight away , however we didn't get a room until 2.30pm.
Our room was to be a partial ocean view , only view of the ocean was when you stood on the edge of the balcony , instead we only saw the other side of the hotel. When we were shown to our room and voiced our displeasure all we got from staff was a insincere 
'Sorry.'

It’s a little bit away from Waikiki beach, which made it a bit quieter which was nice. But it was just a short walk (about 5 minutes) to the main beach and the surfboard rentals, outrigger rentals, the famous Duke’s restaurant and the massive surfing beach. We walked along the beach a few times, and along the street a few times, with every type of shopping imaginable - the location really can’t be beat. 

The service at Halekulani was fantastic - the concierge was extremely helpful with reservations before we arrived (restaurants, surf lessons/board rentals, etc.) and the staff was just as helpful and attentive while we were there. 

We ate dinner on property at House Without a Key and it was very good, with a trio playing live music and a traditional dancer who joined them for a few songs. Breakfast there was amazing as well. (And the drinks were perfectly tropical.)

Our ocean view room was beautiful, clean and comfortable, and the view was breathtaking, with Daimond Head in the distance.

I didn’t love that there was no dedicated beach in front of the hotel - just a small spot of sand where a catamaran came and went for snorkel and sunset cruises...so it was possible to spend a little time in the water there, not an extended time. But as I said, it was only a short walk to Waikiki where we could rent chairs and umbrellas.

I was a little disappointed that the room we reserved with two queens wasn’t available; they needed to bring in a rollaway bed for our family of three. The bed was comfortable, but it made the room a little crowded. Not the end of the world, just inconvenient.

I would definitely recommend the Halekulani for the beauty and service, as well as the location in proximity to shopping, beaches, etc.","Date of stay: August 2018","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

This doesn’t mean, though, that most rooms have unobstructed sea views. My room was billed as “Ocean Front”, with “unobstructed Diamond Head views”, but this was inaccurate on both counts, rather annoying considering the room rate. The room was also fairly basic for 5-star. Mystifyingly, there was no coffee-making equipment, though I liked that there was a small refrigerator instead of the usual minibar stocked with items you don’t want.

However, the staff (front office, housekeeping, restaurants) were agreeable and tried hard to please. The public areas are light and airy, relaxing-feeling. Orchids Restaurant is especially pleasing, with a lovely view and gentle breezes, exactly what you imagine when you think of a Hawaiian terrace overlooking the sea.

Because of the price level, the guests at this hotel tend to be quiet and decorous, and though there are many children, they mostly seem to be well-behaved. Other hotels may offer “better value”, but may not be as quiet or relaxing.

There is an ABC store less than 100 yards from the hotel lobby.

We planned to be there on  a Sunday which I highly recommend for the famous Sunday buffet...be prepared for a culinary experience, a nice bottle of wine and a couple of hours eating fabulous food of all descriptions.

It was myself, my husband and my 19 year old daughter. What amazed all of us was the service! Fantastic!

We booked a partial ocean view for the first part of the stay and moved to the Ocean Front for the back part of our stay). I loved it.

The quietness in the city amazed me! So peaceful so gorgeous. The manager on duty was amazing - Leah. She went over and above in accommodating us and making our stay so special!!!

We loved the Friday behind the scenes tour with Melba at the hotel. One hour long of the different behind the scenes rooms like laundry, bakery, suites etc. and we ended with free tea and coconut cake. What a terrific time!

Our room had 2 queen beds and was HUGE! Bell Staff AMAZING.

There were a few drawbacks but NOT enough to keep me away!

1. The beach . Yes I get that there is really NOT one. But I was ok with that. We hung at the pool and it was steps away from the ocean to which we could swim in the ocean and then return to the pool to dry off etc. I was fine with  lack of sand. There is NOT a lack of ocean! Plenty of space at pool it never felt crowded

2. Turn Down Service. Previous poster said they came when they were in bed. LOL Agreed! I called the front desk the next day and asked for turn down at 6 pm while we were at dinner. Problem solved.

The hospitality is outstanding and the staff all courteous but genuinely friendly.

This is not a resort hotel but something quite lovely in the heart of Waikiki, the location is excellent, right by the shops and just steps along from Waikiki Beach, which you can walk across the Sheraton to reach if you so desire.

We left three days early because of the location and facilities. We felt like we could have been at a nice pool anywhere. 
First, the room. We paid for a premier ocean view. If you looked out the window diagonally, it was a nice diamond head/ocean view. If you looked straight, it was the huge hotel next to us. Also, as someone else mentioned, no coffee, no iron, no minibar in room. Bed wasn’t up to expected standard either. Turn down service came when I was already in bed. 

Second, the pool. The pool is mediocre. They have squished so many chairs around it that, when laying on my stomach, I looked up and was three feet from some guys face. When I looked behind me, another guy was right there by my rear. Ugh!  You also cannot truly see the ocean from the pool. There is a big hedge blocking it. And the pedestrian walkway is right there so lots of people are walking by. 

Third, the beach. There is no beach. There is one little metal gate on only one side of the property that leads to the beach area. The beach is in front of the hotel next door but it’s tiny. We sat on a concrete wall with our feet in the sand. We had to move when a catamaran landed there because there was no room. There is no beach. 

Fourth, no oceanfront bar. There is no place to get a drink while you look at the ocean. We had to go next door to the Sheraton. 

Two stars because the staff was really nice and food was good. But there was no connection to the ocean. I could have been at a pool anywhere. We completely overpaid for half a view. We are spending ten days in Hawaii for my 50th and we’re so bummed out we almost went home. Switched to hotel in ko Olina and will continue on with our plans.

We are in an Ocean View Suite at $1600/night and there is not even a coffee pot or tea in the room, no sodas.  Why have a wet bar in the room with literally nothing in it but water?  There is no beach set up from the hotel , and very little beach access from the hotel as well. You walk out of a gate and then there is a sea wall that you must walk around to gain access to the public beach.  When I’m in Hawaii I want to be at a resort that offers beach set up with decent access.  The pool is small and largely over crowded requiring us to go down and save seats at 7am  but it does not feel relaxing at all. 

Housekeeping does a good job but last night they came for turn down service at 5pm and tonight it’s currently 8:40pm and they have not been by.  

The balconies or lanais are large but very outdated and uncomfortable patio furniture. The bed is hard and the decor is very outdated and plain, not what you would expect in Hawaii.  

 The food and drinks in the restaurants are great, being the only positive we have found. For the price point, we definitely expect more in a room as far as simple things .. sodas , cofffee pot , iron and ironing board in the room .. none of which were there or even available upon request.  

We have paid for our stay in full in advance and are leaving a day early to go to the next Island because we are so uncomfortable with the accommodations here.  We will definitely not be back.

A first time for me coming to Hawaii and I felt I hit the jackpot in terms of a great place to stay with my family.

Halekulani is not a cheap stay, but as I say, you pay for what you get and you get exceptional service all round.

The rooms are great and spacious including the bathrooms. We were up on the 4th floor overlooking the pool and ocean.

There is an older, almost colonial vibe at this hotel, but it's classy at the same time.
There are pool side manners to adhere to and noise is kept to a minimum by vigilant but very polite staff.

Food orders and drinks are superb and come quickly, with plenty of staff attending to your needs.  There is a general dinning area for hotel guest to grab a buffet style breakfast, lunch, snack, cocktails and an evening bite.

TIP: Make sure you include your brekky as part of your room stay.

Orchids is the fine dining restaurant on the property and the food and wine selection is incredible, but again at a cost.  Lewers Lounge is the Hotels Cocktail bar and is also accessible by non hotel guests. I have to say Lewers is one of the best cocktail bars I have drunk in, it,s a little dark, but I think that adds a little authenticity especially when the jazz band is playing.

NB: Lewers is not the kind of spot you would take the kids, its about some adult time a cosmo and a neat scotch :)

There is no beach in front of the resort, however in saying that there is a small beach landing where you can grab some nice little body waves.  If you want beach, you can stroll for 10 minutes to the main beach at Waikiki and for surf you can hire a board and paddle straight out front for a few hundred meters to catch some great waves.

The one negative I have is the pool area lacked a vibe you would normally associate with a tropical location and this was for one reason only...no music! (hopefully hotel will rectify this in the future)

The above said, overall a top spot

Enjoy!","Date of stay: June 2018","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

This hotel is awesome!  It's history is intriguing, and it's reputation is impressive!  We have been wanting to stay at the Halekulani, and in June our dream came true!  

Our rooms were generously sized, well- decorated, very clean and comfortable, and had a lanai, with 2 chairs, a table, a lounge, and a view of the ocean.  The bathrooms had plenty of light, a soaking tub and a separate shower, a covered stool for sitting in front of the sink and mirror in addition to the toilet and sink.  Thick towels and washcloths and robes are provided. There is an awesome view of Diamond Head from particular vantage spots on the property.  The pool is large and lovely and we enjoyed playing in the pool and relaxing on the lounge chairs.  As I was resting and reading, I was offered fresh pineapple and, later, some ice cream.  Drinks and snacks are available for purchase.  Flavored ice water and sunscreen are also available in the pool area.  We were given some great amenities in our rooms, in addition to shampoo, conditioner, lotion, and large soaps.  I particularly appreciated the cleaner and cloth for my glasses and sunglasses. 

We had meals from the restaurant, House Without A Key.  The beach setting was wonderful, the food was delicious, the servers were helpful.  We ordered room service for breakfast on our lanai one morning, and the food was delicious, the service was impeccable, and the whole experience was luxurious.  

Our grandson got sick one night, and we called for help from the hotel staff.  Within minutes the manager called to see how he was doing and if he needed a doctor.  We decided to go to a nearby clinic, and his daddy carried him to the lobby, where we asked how to get to the clinic.  It was less than a block away, but tricky to find.  A very kind hotel staff member led the way.  The doctor gave our little guy some medicine and a prescription to get filled the next day.  When we returned to the room, it was all fresh and clean.  The next day, the manager called again to check and see how our grandson was feeling.  We asked if we could get a late check-out time, and they offered to allow us the use one of our two rooms until we needed to leave for the airport later that afternoon.    We were so impressed with and grateful for the caring and kindness of the personnel of the hotel.

We had such a wonderful experience and loved the property and amenities so much, and will definitely recommend the Halekulani Hotel to family and friends, and we look forward to returning soon!","Date of stay: June 2018","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

In all my years of travel I have never been to such a hotel that ticks all the boxes. The welcome on arrival, the waiting room if you’re rooms not ready, the restaurants of which you must try Orchids this restaurant alone was Heaven. 
We were shown to our room which had an amazing view of the pool and ocean. The bed was very comfortable and serviced twice a day, with little gifts left on your bed each night. The pool and bar service was amazing, these guys knew their job and did it amazing well. Again the little treats given out fresh fruit and ice poles at various times during the day. 
I could easily go on and on, my only sincere advice is to visit this hotel and then you will find out what it’s like to visit Heaven while here on Earth.
Finally no business can do a job like this without the right staff, well here these guys are in a league of their own. I really felt everyone loved working at this hotel and nothing was to hard for them to help you with.

Check w/ the hotel but I think it was the first night that they do a manager's party.  Drinks and appetizers are served in the garden area.  It was a nice touch and a great thing to do if you can time it to be there during this weekly party.  The hotel breakfast area was good.  We actually preferred the one that is the buffet.  Service was much better there.  Didn't find the other one that takes reservations worth the extra time as the service was lacking.  Found the hotel lovely and comfortable.  The pool is nothing special- think it hasn't been updated in a long time but chairs are comfortable and the staff is eager to please w/ towel set up, ice waters etc.  Walk nearby to hit the beach or nearby hotel - think it is a Sheraton- that had a happening bar and vibe.","Date of stay: May 2018","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I am about to have a swim in the pool and an attendant quickly runs over to a deck chair and places a towel for me to lay on. Then offers to apply sunscreen on me. Yes! Please!! :-)
I take a quick dip and decide to relax on the deck chair for a while. My drink order is brought over and a few minutes later I'm offered a cool wet face washer to refresh me. Greatly appreciated in this heat. 
Next day I chose the private beach. Very small but the water was a perfect temperature that was neither too warm or too cool. I floated effortlessly on the water as gentle swells rocked me slowly. Of course, when I got out of the water there was a beach towel waiting for me. 
Did I mention the Maserati in the foyer? Available to hire for a day out. I did enquire but my budget didn't quite allow for such a thrill. 
The day we checked out was going to be a long one with a lot of luggage as our flight didn't leave till after 7.00pm. So, I asked at reception about leaving our bags there all day. They were happy to do this but also offered the use of the complimentary day room. The 'day room' starts with a staffed service desk as you enter. There are large storage lockers that took all my luggage and I'm given the only access to open the locker again. I'm then given a guided tour of the 'day room'. The lounge, shower, bathroom, dressing room and of course, the bedroom. The television is playing but there were also quiet places where one person was sitting and reading a book. Plus, we still had full use of the facilities.

Room is spacious, well decorated and has all the amenities (apart from a kettle or coffee machine). Staff are cheerful, helpful and knowledgeable. Level of personal interaction with the staff is down to personal choice - completely un-intrusive.

Nice gym and spectacular outside pool. Three restaurants of varying levels of cuisine and formality. Worth taking a pair of trousers and shirt/dress as some formal areas.

It is a beautiful hotel with so many areas to lounge, read a book, enjoy and relax. The room was comfortable with little details that made it feel luxurious; such as robes, slippers and a roomy bathroom. (Although it may need a bit of an update). The room was clean and upon checking in, we had a platter of fresh fruit waiting for us in the room, which was a nice touch. We had dinner and breakfast at Orchids and it did not disappoint. Everything was fresh. It is a bit pricey, but I've gotten used to that in Hawaii, that in order to get quality food, you must dine at high end restaurants, period. I did not give it five stars only because the pool area is a little small and crowded. Also it looked a little disorganized where people gather and lounge right next to the pool but the rest of the area has abandoned chairs and tables just kind of thrown out there upside down. Pool looks small. I did not get in the pool, but I didn't really care since I was looking forward to the infinity pool at our second hotel. More on the positive: another advantage is that this hotel is right on the beach. Literally within walking steps. Overall we really enjoyed it. The staff is really nice.

The opportunity for sunset cocktails and musical entertainment, continues.  The weekly Manager's Cocktail reception continues, but was much busier in our week with some fellow tourists behaving as if it was to be their final meal and drink ! The poolside area is so orderly with staff on hand to get you not only the towels but also the seats, and bar service as needed. If you eat in, the choice for style of restaurant is enough, and so much calmer than  battling the throng out in Waikiki if you're not into that battle some evenings. Rooms are comfortably furnished whatever view you have chosen, but have an ocean view from a high floor if you can.  We like a minibar that has little in it, so we can decide what we want, and stock, and we appreciated the daily resupply of water. I had already commented to management about a lack of coffee maker, and iron/ironing board as standard in the rooms, and it's a credit to Halekulani management that I have already received a courteous reply by mail addressing the small concerns I raised. Finally we had no complaints about staff in any area, everyone was professional in their role. We'd stay again.","Date of stay: March 2018","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Valets were great too, organized a stretch limo to the airport, no problem.

We haven't been in over a decade and decided it was worth a try and we loved our experience.  First I'll say the rooms are little small.  If you're going to stay here and money isn't an issue get a junior suite overlooking the water - straight on view.  It took us three tries to get a proper ocean facing view high enough where we weren't staring into someone else's balcony or overlooking roof tops.  But don't let that detract.

The rooms are comfortable, well appointed, with firm beds, wonderful pillows, and air conditioning that works.  Open the sliders and overlook the water and it's paradise.  From check in throughout our stay the service was top notch.  The restaurants are fabulous - lunches poolside at the more casual spot or breakfast, lunch or dinner with table clothes and exceptional services and food at Orchid.  The bar - L' Aperitif is AMAZING.  and it's at La Mer which is their fine dining experience.  With three restaurants there is something for everyone and we love love love that the place isn't chock full of strollers and kids at restaurants that are supposed to be adult experiences - a reason we left the other property on the island after two nights.  

Halekulani is old school but with a refinement that works.  I agree the rooms could use a little spiffing - they'd be well served by taking one of the buildings and taking down the walls - so there are larger rooms that are more competitive. They could charge a higher price and no one would balk. 

 It's an excellent property around the corner from the Rodeo Drive of Honolulu.  A one block walk and you are on an amazing stretch of the city that is beautiful, walkable, and lots of fun. It's convenient, warm, friendly and the food is amazing and service is amazing. The rooms are very very comfortable if not a bit small but I wouldn't let that detract for a minute.  Probably the best experience on Waikiki beach and on Oahu overall. I didn't have time to use the spa but would have had we stayed longer.  This is a great spot and worth the experience especially for couples but we'd bring our adult kids and grandkids on a family vacay  in a heartbeat.","Date of stay: March 2018","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Inside courtyard to beach is wonderful with large pool area and, of course, staffed to give you wonderful pool service.

Room was ocean view, 5th floor. Clean, adequately sized King. Great hearing the waves at night but, one downside to lots of staff and the place being clean, the workers start early cleaning the poolside. Just a tip for management: while the work has to be done and understood the chit chat across the pool area at 5:00 a.m. could be kept to a minimum. Complimentary champagne sent to our room for our anniversary was nice touch! Someone is paying attention!

The patio restaurant serves as breakfast ( $36/person buffet only option ) and all meals. VERY busy at night with sundown and singing. Orchid next to that is less formal, opens later. Hard to find a bar to just sit and have a cocktail as patio is usually packed. La Mer is stunning but formal which is ok. Nice bar, slacks for men required.

When business (and a good corporate rate) created the opportunity, I jumped at the chance.  I brought my wife and son (11) with me on business to Honolulu.  I think the reviewers who don’t “get” the Halekulani miss that this is a hotel about service and tradition.  Yes, they would renovate the rooms and make them very modern, but that would lessen some what makes the hotel special.

Overall, the hotel was beautifully manicured.  I love great landscaping, especially in Hawaii.  I really enjoyed the plants and emerald green lawns.  It truly is an beautiful quiet oasis in Waikiki.  The public spaces are immaculate and beautiful.  I did find some housekeeping issues (strange spill stain on the nightstand and hair in the bathroom soap dish). But generally, the hotel and rooms felt very clean.  We were upgraded to a nice ocean view room (partial).  We debated some of the options at the front desk but I think they really got it right in terms of room for the three of us and a view.  We were greeted with fruit, wine, and cookies and milk.  I don’t know if they do that for everyone or that was part of our corporate arrangement.  It was well appreciated in any case.

I think I had the best room service meal I have ever had one night here — great food, presentation and service.  The food in the restaurant was very good, but not “over-the-top” great.  We had the breakfast buffet at House Without a Key and dinner at Orchids.

My son wasn’t impressed with the pool and I didn’t really expect him to be.  I kept reminding him this was a business trip that he was coming along on — not a vacation where I was doing business on the side.  For a kid there are certainly better (or rather, more exciting) pool areas at other hotels.  The pool at the Halekulani is best used for a dip and for lounging around.  That would work for me, certainly.  He was absolutely fascinated the the high tech (I think of them as Japanese) toilets in the public areas.  They had all the cleaning and drying functions you could want.  He found it amazing.

The concierge services were great in helping us decide what to do over the weekend.  They were very patient with my wife’s endless questions.

There were only a few service missteps; (1) there were only two robes on the room when we arrived.  The hotel knew we were three and there were three plates for the snack gifts.  The lady that showed us to the room said she would have an additional one sent up.  When the guy arrived with the robe, it was a very very small child’s robe.  There was no way it was going to fit my son.  The guy had absolutely no uptake when I asked if they had a bigger one or if he would bring an adult robe.  I didn’t tip him because that should have been in the room before we arrived and he had absolutely no intention of making things right.  (2) when checking out, my son had written a “hotel” postcard to my aunt who had been with us on a prior trip to Waikiki when he was 2.  I asked the front desk to mail it.  She asked how I wanted to pay for the stamp.  Actually, I didn’t want to pay for a stamp, but didn’t argue.  I think a Hotel postcard being sent by a guest when you are charging the better part of $1,000 a night should just provide the damn stamp.  I think I got charged a letter rate on top of it.  Shabby (and completely unnecessary) under the circumstances.","Date of stay: March 2018","Trip type: Traveled on business","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

The location (although in the heart of Waikiki) feel nestled in a secluded area away from the hustle and bustle.  That's the great thing about Oahu...you can get lost in the shopping, eating, and playing in Waikiki, or you can go to the secluded areas that make you feel like you're on you own personal private island.  Halekulani has the BEST customer service EVER.  Five stars for the genuine service from the moment you pull into the valet, to the personalized service of an attendant taking you on a tour of the grounds, and showing you the amenities in your room, to the restaurants....and the pool!  What a gem, the pool is the most serene place to lounge on your vacation.  In the morning, it's best to claim your spot ASAP because the good spots fill up fast.  
The pool has some incredible tables with umbrellas, a table with chairs as well as the most cushy/comfy chaise lounges.  The table makes all the difference in the world when you're trying to relax away from daily stressors.  We felt completely safe leaving our personal belongings on our table and chairs while we swam, ate breakfast and even ran up to the room for more books, iPod, etc.  In the morning, the pool attendants bring mini muffins, in the afternoon, they offer fresh pineapple, in the late afternoon when it gets hotter, they bring around ice cream bars!  The customer service from every single person we encountered was so nice.  It was consistent thru and thru.  
The rooms are beautiful, it was quiet, and exceptionally comfortable.  The lobby area has several couches and chairs with surrounding water elements, which made it so relaxing to just sit and be.  You can't go wrong staying here.
We also visited the spa, had an incredible waterless pedicure, and almost fell asleep in the zero gravity chairs they have.  A blanket, a beverage, and warm/caring attendants pampering you was delightful.  All around the most lovely stay and worth every penny.

I very much enjoyed my stay at the Halekulani!

Some of the many pluses were:
Fantastic staff. Everyone was very professional, helpful and warm.
My room (I think it was a ""partial ocean view king"" on maybe the eighth floor?) was quiet, comfortable, and spacious. The furniture was either new or has been properly taken care of, and the decor was very serene. The bed and pillows were awesome! 
The shower had great water pressure and temp control
There was a mini fridge which was always restocked with plenty of bottled water; they will also bring you complementary hot water carafes whenever you want (I always bring tea bags with me when traveling, so this was much appreciated!)
There is a nice little beach right outside the hotel (and obviously you can discover the entire rest of Waikiki Beach if you keep walking). The hotel pool wasn't huge but that didn't matter to me as I am not a pool person.
There were Hawaiian musicians on a little outdoor stage every evening outside by the House Without a Key restaurant; it was relaxing to sit on my balcony watching the ocean and listening to the music. And if you order up a piece of their coconut cake and a mai tai, well, that is heaven right there. :)  
Even on the weekend, with weddings and parties going on, the hotel never felt crowded or chaotic; it was a really well-run property
They went the extra mile in little things like the lovely turn down service, and providing fresh fruit and a little box of chocolates in your room when you arrive. I did get a kick out of seeing absolutely everything from the shoe polish kit to the water bottles branded with the Halekulani orchid, but it shows that someone has really thought about the details.

There were just a few minor quibbles (holding up a really high bar): the smallish fitness room was okay - good cardio machines, but some of the exercise balls and the BOSU had seen better days, and the room was crammed full of stuff, so there wasn't much room to work out in or work around other people exercising. This is one of the very few hotel gyms I have been to that actually did have a fairly steady stream of people using it, so it would be nice if they had a larger space.  
The breakfast buffet in my opinion was actually totally worth the money (however, I can easily cram in $36 worth of smoked salmon, fresh fruit and pastries) - it was a wonderful spread of delicious fresh food, and the pastries were properly made, flaky pastries, which also seems to be really hard to find in hotel buffets. However, the coffee was shockingly not good (even paying an extra 9 bucks for a French press coffee one morning was a fail) - so I ended up walking over to Starbucks every morning, which was quite sad.

I did not eat at any of the restaurants for dinner so can't comment on them. There is an ABC right down the street, so I got most of my snacks, salads, etc there. 

I would definitely recommend paying a little more to book at least a partial ocean view room - totally worth it! 

I had a wonderful, relaxing time at the Halekulani and would highly recommend this beautiful hotel.","Date of stay: January 2018","Trip type: Traveled on business","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We stayed here 4 years ago & everything was perfect. This time not so much. We stayed in one of the Diamond Head rooms. Our room was 962. The room was clean & comfortable but we were hoping to be higher & closer to the ocean. We asked when we arrived but no other rooms were available-at least not for Americans.
Even the employees were not as friendly as 4 years old. The Halekulani is managed by a Japanese company & they truly only care about the Japanese clients. It first we thought is was just us but we met visitors from England, Canada & Australia who felt the same way. We will NEVER go back to the Halekulani again.
I went to the Spa for several treatments. I had the Halekulani facial which was nice but my therapist kept adding products which added to the price. I also had the Halekulani Supreme which included a scrub & massage which was nice to not really special. Be careful as a very generous tip is included & when you check out they ask if you want to add more. I always enjoy going to the Spa whenever we are on vacation & enjoy trying new treatments but for the cost-skip this Spa.","Date of stay: September 2017","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

From the moment I arrived I knew I had made the right choice. You would think that with a location on Waikiki that it would be loud and commercialized like the rest of the area, but that couldn't be further from reality. This property is tucked away in its own little corner of the busy tourist district and truly feels like it is on its own island. 

Check-in was quick, easy and professional. The front desk staff even escorted me to my room -- what a nice touch. The property is very nice with an open-air feel. I reserved an Ocean View Junior Suite and I was very happy with my decision. Here is an important tip. If you want anything other than a standard room I would advise calling them. When I booked my room there were no suites listed online, yet when I called they had several to choose from. The only drawback with this room is that the ocean front view does not have a balcony, but only a railing that overlooks the ocean. The full balcony is on the side of the room and does have a partial ocean view. If you want a true ocean front balcony I would recommend an upgraded suite that has a full ocean front view. Their web site has a very handy room view guide that shows where each room type is located on a property map.

The room was very elegantly appointed in a modern Hawaiian style. There was a desk and small sitting area with wet bar in the entry, and in the bedroom was a king bed, sofa, and comfortable chair with ottoman. The balcony was well-appointed with a chaise lounge and table with two chairs.

The bathroom was very nice with a full soaking tub and separate shower, water closet and a full sized walk-in closet. The vanity is a single low vanity with a stool. The water closet features a Toto automated toilet with bidet, heated seat, etc.

The Halekulani has truly gone to extreme lengths to ensure guests have an amazing experience. They offer unlimited free bottled water and refresh ice daily in the rooms.

The houskeeping staff was amazing as well, always calling me by name in the hallway.

I only visited House Without A Key restaurant during my stay. On both visits I received absolutely amazing service with fantastic food. I liked the casual atmosphere at this restaurant as the other dining options seemed a bit stuffy.

Thanks to the entire staff at Halekulani for making my stay absolutely perfect.","Date of stay: February 2018","Trip type: Traveled solo","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The landscaping, the architecture and location all remind you that you are in an elegant, secluded and peaceful setting.  

I am an American and could not help but feel the hotel was catering primarily to Japanese visitors.  This is not a negative, but it is an observation from my visit last week.  This reinforces the sense of quiet tranquility - as Americans (and their children) do tend to be louder.  The entire property enjoys a quiet hush over the public spaces that is unusual (and some Americans may consider this too formal and uncomfortable).

The tranquility and class of the ""Hale"" is unrivaled in the Waikiki area.  A warm welcome from bell staff the second you drive up and being personally escorted to our room by check in staff made the start of our visits filled with much Aloha.  How lovely to be at a hotel that sincerely seems happy to have you as guest.  Luggage was delivered to the room in minutes.  One visit was during our Anniversary so, what a nice surprise to have complimentary chilled Champagne delivered the first day.   The Hale's restaurants and lounges are fabulous.   We ate and enjoyed all of them.  House Without a Key at sunset, Orchids, Le Mer, and Lewers Lounge, all outstanding.  The pool, patio and ocean lawn is a dream.  The pool staff were wonderful and attentive.  We never had a problem getting loungers and umbrella that we wanted.   Because of its location and higher level of security, the Hale gets very little to none non-guest foot traffic that some other Waikiki are resorts get.  It has a tranquil and quiet vibe.  Well dressed and professional hotel security personnel constantly walk the grounds and lobbies of the hotel at all hours, so guests feel very ""protected"" there. The beach front at the Hale is tiny, but you're just steps from main Waikiki so that was not an issue for us.

Halekulani is a calm and serene oasis in the middle of Waikiki !   
Many 5 Star resorts pretend to be fancy, and charge accordingly, but then disappoint!
However, Halekulani Hotel is truly classy, with no pretences; just a lovely place to stay.
Many chic restaurants claim to have the best Zagat or AAA ratings, but still feel Halekulani's La Mer, on the top floor overlooking the beach, with exquisitely prepared food and lovely Hawaiian ambiance, is the best place to have a romantic dinner!  
Their other eateries are quite fine, too.  House Without a Key is one of my favourites.
You won't be dissapointed staying at the historic (but modern) Halekulani Hotel!   
Wouldn't stay anywhere else! 
(Okay, did have to stay 'somewhere else' on last trip, as we were too preoccupied organizing our cruise from Sydney to Honolulu, and regrettable, left it too late... 
Halekulani was sold out at Thanksgiving.  
We stayed at the equally lovely, Kahala -- but not as fine an experience as the Halekulani Hotel!  
Seemed to cater more to kids with the dolphin shows -- which might be considered a little passé now-a-days!

I have never stayed at this hotel.  This is based on service practices alone.

Back in November, I purchased a gift card at the front desk and mailed it to a family member so they could send it along with other Christmas gifts.  The gift card was mailed out from the east coast in early December, but never made it to Hawaii.  There was no tracking on the package, so I assumed it was a loss.

I phoned the hotel and was put in touch with General Cashier, Pat Yamamoto.  I explained the situation and gave her my transaction details.  She stated that she would be back in touch with me in a day.  Sure enough, she phoned early the next morning and was able to locate the card number.  Seeing that it had not been redeemed, she offered to invalidate the lost card and issue a new gift card for the same amount.

Pat deserves praise for being at the 5-star level that the Halekulani is world renowned for.  She went out of her way to do the research and handled each step with complete professionalism.  As a former luxury hotel manager, it reminded me that in this environment, they don't use the word ""no""

As a local resident, we frequent the hotel once or twice a month for dining.  We love the Lewers Lounge to sip cocktails and listen to nightly jazz.  You also can't beat the sunset views from House Without a Key.

The Halekulani truly is a gem in Waikiki, and the service is outstanding.  If you are planning a trip to Waikiki, we would strongly recommend staying there, as it is by far the best hotel on the strip.  The only reasons I rated it four instead of five are related to Waikiki itself and one very frustrating management decision/rule.

If you are planning a trip to Hawaii and considering Waikiki, you should understand that it may not be a very relaxing or very Hawaiian experience.  Waikiki is chaotic, crowded, and noisy, and while the Halekulani is something of an oasis, it does not (and cannot) address all of those issues.  There is no quiet, private space on the entire property.  More than half of the lounge chairs surround a small (albeit reasonably sized by Waikiki standards) pool, that tends to be quite loud due to all of the families.  If you manage to secure lounge chairs away from the pool that have a view of the ocean, you will still not find privacy and quiet because people are constantly walking past you on the partial Waikiki beach walk and three times per day a line forms right next to you for the catamaran that boards on the beach in front of the hotel.  Essentially, you are on television, with people constantly standing and staring or walking past your chair.  This is not the fault of the hotel, but I mention it because it is a reality of Waikiki that will affect your experience.  

I prefer quiet and peace on a beach vacation, so in order to find it in Waikiki I awoke very early every morning (sometimes awakened by car alarms, unfortunately, but that is a reality of Waikiki) to sit by the sea, look at the stars, and watch the sun rise before the crowds descended.  Each morning was beautiful, and I managed to enjoy an hour or two of quiet.  The only issue was the management decision I mentioned above.  They have instituted a rule that guests cannot have pool/beach towels before 7:00 am.  I assume this is because they have had issues in the past with guests using them to save chairs they are not sitting in, but I just wanted a towel or two to keep warm while I watched the sunrise.  My husband and I found a solution to this problem that did not involve asking the pool attendants to break the rules, but it was very annoying to have to behave in this clandestine manner when you are paying Halekulani prices and simply want a towel for your chair while you watch the sun rise.  

Other than these two issues, the Halekulani is truly a House befitting heaven.  Our room, Lanai, and view were lovely, House Without A Key and Orchids were delicious (and you can get their entire menus from in-room dining if you prefer to eat on your Lanai), and the staff and service are really outstanding.  You do have the benefit of walking to shops and restaurants in Waikiki, so the location is perfect for that purpose.

Overall, I would say whether to stay at the Halekulani depends on the type of vacation you are looking for.  If you are looking for peace, quiet, privacy, and relaxation, stay at the Kahala (which is not in Waikiki) or on another island.  If you want to stay in Waikiki for any reason (and there at many reasons to do so), stay at the Halekulani.  You will be very glad you did.","Date of stay: December 2017","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Their name in Hawaiian, ""house befitting heaven,"" describes the hotel's approach to taking care of guests. Our room was ""ocean view"" which means a lateral view--descriptions are confusing and I did not realize there was a category above this with a full-on ocean view, so read carefully when booking. Our sixth-floor room was airy, beautifully appointed and quiet, with a large furnished balcony looking looking out on the ocean. The service was outstanding, including a big assist from manager Frank Pulay when we had misgivings about an open-ended island tour (misgivings that turned out to be correct as an estimated three-hour tour turned into a six-hour tour plagued by bad traffic). The diverse breakfast buffet at Room without a Key was luscious (better than the more ordinary ""Complete Breakfast"" at Orchids) and our dinner at their French restaurant La Mer was spectacular. We were able to go on the hotel's private tour of the Doris Duke estate and it was fabulous--a small shuttle direct to the site, a private tour, and an introductory film beforehand--all free for guests. Speaking of guests, the other guests were mostly Japanese visitors and their elegance added to the beautiful and serene atmosphere. We even glimpsed a Japanese bride and I can't think of a more beautiful setting for a wedding--or, naturally, an anniversary. Though it is not inexpensive, the hotel is an excellent value.

the rooms are nice and well appointed.  my room was a partial ocean view with a balcony done in all white.   the room was comfortable, but not overwhelming.   the bathroom lage and modern with their own brand of amentties they say with local ingredients   i liked that

the room is not the reason to stay here  but rather the service.  they have a can do attitude.   they are there to please the guest.

i especially enjoyed the breakfast buffet which tried to incorporate local products like cocunut syrup for the pancakes.  i liked that they had fresh squeezed pineapple juice.  service was very attentive.

the location is the best.  while not a full beach, the pool is beautiful with lots of chaise lounges and attentive service.  free suntan lotion. a short walk to the main drag and all the best stores are there.

i was there on a wednesday night and they had a guest cocktail party with sushi and drinks.  it was an opportunity to meet the GM.  he runs a great operation

Plenty of restaurants to choose from, all with superb service and high quality food.  The hotel itself is a bit outdated though, and the rooms are quite small.  The bathroom is TINY and the shower is so small you can barely get two people in there.  Barely enough space to open 2 carry on suitcases and in fact, I had to walk through the closet to get into the bathroom.

The property is beautiful and the guest rooms are spacious, modern, and extremely comfortable.  Our room had a wonderful ocean view looking towards Diamond Head.  The service was at all times and in all venues, warm, friendly, very professional and very competent.  Although the hotel was very busy, the ambiance is quiet and very peaceful.  The three restaurants are all oceanfront and excellent.  They range from the casual House Without a Key, to the beautiful mid-range Orchids, to the very elegant and formal La Mer (with its stunning adjacent L’Aperitif Bar).  Each evening Hawaiian music performed oceanside is heard at all three restaurants.  After dinner, cocktails at the Lewers Lounge is a special treat with wonderful live jazz.  The beautiful pool is centrally located, and service there is also terrific.  We have stayed at many five star hotels, and the Halekulani is clearly one of the very best.

Our co coordinator Joel, was so down to earth but professional and organised at the same time. Catered to our needs and so accommodating.  Special mention to our manager for our reception and ceremony, John, life saver, hero! He followed me around with cold water, slippers...what ever I needed without being seen or in my way. How did he do it!!! 
Food was great too!

However when considering value for the cost per night, I couldn't help but being left underwhelmed. This became especially clear when we spent a day with our friends who were staying at the Ritz Residences. While you're not directly on the beach, the amenities, quality of customer service, and finishing of the facilities far exceeded that of Halekulani. 

Halekulani Pros: 
- Beautiful location right on the beach
- Nice large pool where you can spend the entire day
- Restaurant and bar right on the beach
- Large bathrooms and spacious rooms
- Large screen TV w/ HDMI input

Halekulani Cons:
- Dated rooms: Rooms felt as though they were cool in the 90s. Huge balcony but it only had 2 chairs on it. Low design-aesthetic in the rooms. 
- Average service: Staff was friendly and helpful, but I didn't get the feeling that I was being catered to or fawned over which is definitely how I felt at the Ritz during my day by the pool there. 
- Poor value: As the most expensive hotel in Waikiki, I expected to be wowed by the property and its service. Instead I was left feeling as though I'd overpaid.

Ten out of ten for service.

Considering the extremely high price, the place had a slightly run down feeling to it - patches in the carpet on the second level and flooding in the corridor with a rain storm. We also felt a bit disconnected from the main beach - there is a tiny patch of beach next to the hotel, but you have to walk past another hotel  to get to the main beach. People crowd the outdoor area and boardwalk at sunset so even if you have a prime spot, you'll be crowded out...I think we'd head further down to Waikiki Beach proper next time for breathing space.","Date of stay: October 2017","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Other reviewers have noted the high levels of service provided by the staff and this was consistent with our experience.  One of our group was dropped at the wrong hotel and the staff was quick to send a car late in the evening to collect them that was very much appreciated.

If your inbound flight arrives early in the day, pre-packing a day pack is recommended.  Our room was not ready on arrival and we needed to use the guest lounge which is comfortable but not where you really want to be when visiting Waikiki.  

The buffet breakfast was enjoyable and varied, the omelette maker has an incredible skill to discover customer orders from guests with little ability to speak English, and remember who ordered what, when he had 5 omelettes on the go at once.

Initially we thought the pool looked ordinary based on other international resorts however you soon realise the pool is really good for this beachside location.  It is salt treated that is much more pleasant than chemicals and it is securely gated that means the public is not walking through.

The hotel is close to a well-stocked ABC store, and a First Hawaiian Bank ATM that handles international cards on the corner of Lewers St and Kalakaua Ave.  Restaurants and shops are a short stroll.

Congratulations to management and staff for the consistent high quality service.","Date of stay: September 2017","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

During a few years in the middle it seemed to be slipping a little.  About 4 years ago we were assured that the new general manager had told his staff that service was, once again, to be number 1.  In that time we have definitely seen a change for the better.  While not quite to the standard of Mr Honda yet, the staff has made a  wonderful turnaround and I have to say the service is once again tip top.  We had friends with us and they, not having stayed here before, were awed by the completeness and warmth of the service.  We were here for 7 nights so we saw it all.

Its location is superb, On the water but just far enough away from the chaos of the main beach at Waikiki. Close to the heart of the restaurant and shopping precinct. the hotel public spaces are an oasis of peace and luxury and  beautifully appointed. The staff are the warmest and friendliest we have ever met. They all seem genuinely pleased to help and their pride at working in such a great Hotel shows in their  positive attitude. Our room was modern and furnished with style and class.  Bed and linen was top quality.  the bathroom was compact but five star in fittings. House keeper came within minutes of pressing the 'make up my room' button. The food and wait service is also 5 star. without doubt the best hotel or restaurant meals we have ever had. We thoroughly loved every meal we had there. La Mer is the best dining in Hawaii , and we think it rates right up there at the top in terms of service and cuisine with anything we have been to in our travels. The Hotel guests at the time we stayed were about 60% Japanese and 40% European. This meant there wasn't the usual competition for poolside loungers  and being a small Hotel (by Hawaii standards) relaxing in the outdoor areas was very enjoyable and stress free.  All the guests made an effort to dress well so it did feel very up market but not an overly formal way. There is a dress standard for dinner so no Tee shirts and flip flops. The great thing about this Hotel is it became part of the whole Hawaii experience, not just a place to sleep. For us this is the whole reason for holidays , that is  to forget about the rest of the world and just live for the moment.
 And last but by no means least least, without doubt Halekulani makes  the best MaiTai's in Hawaii.

Is it expensive?  Yes.  It's the most expensive hotel on Waikiki.  Is it worth it?  Absolutely.  Given how many staff are on the ground (including many managers --- I even saw the GM on site walking around the premise, making sure everyone is satisfied), how attentive they are, how comfortable they make you --- I thought it is worth every penny.  

The room, of course, is top-notch. Decorated to make you feel welcomed and comfortable. I loved their closet (you have access both from the bedroom and bathroom --- I will incorporate that idea if I ever get to build my own house).  It was kept impeccably clean, and they kept it that way every day and night.  Thank you so much!!  Housekeeping staff is just fantastic. I never walk on the carpet barefooted in a hotel, but I actually did at Halekulani. However, there is really no need if you don't want to walk barefooted; they provide you with plush slippers.  

Every Wednesday night, they hold what they call a ""manager's reception"", and they do not cut corners there either!  Free drinks and amazing appetizers for 90 minutes or so!!  We actually ate so much (didn't mean to, but food was so good that we kept on getting more and more food) that we had to cancel our dinner reservation that evening.

They also have many other perks!!  Most of the museums are free. They also have some exclusive tours. Definitely take advantage of everything they offer you! You won't regret it.

The hotel pool is, of course, AMazing.  I cannot even begin to explain. On the other side of the pool is the Ocean. How can it get better than that?  Really. Yes, you want to be courteous and shower before getting back in the pool, but you can just hop out of the hotel ground, dip into the ocean for 10 minutes, shower, then hop into the pool, which is kept at the skin-temperature. Do you know what skin-temperature water is like?  Maybe I was naive, but this was the first pool that had temperature set to human skin --You don't feel cold nor warm when you dip into the pool.  Absolute perfection.  Now, I didn't stay too much at the pool (I will next time, though), and I cannot tell you how loud it gets at the pool with all families having fun as well. Yes, the pool is for the hotel guests only. And, yes, it's worth staying at the hotel just to experience that pool (I'm telling you).  BTW, they also don't use harsh chemical like chlorine, but they actually use salt water system --- which means there is no harsh chemical smell. I was a competitive swimmer for 15 years --- smell of chlorine gets my adrenaline going (not exactly a relaxing experience), so I very much appreciated their pool.

Now, I can keep on going about how amazing our experiences were... I think they pretty much ruined all of my future hotel stays everywhere else. LOL... So, stay there at your own risk!!  It will absolutely be amazing, but every other hotels may pale in comparison...","Date of stay: July 2017","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The Conscierge desk is supremely helpful, Orchids restaurant is one of the best we found on Waikiki beach, music is offered each night at House without a Key - casual and early dining. La Mer is another French smart restaurant in the hotel, the food is undeniably good, but it's ludicrously expensive. And, a tip: don't buy the wine by the glass (you're scalped) buy a bottle - which is over-the-top dear too. 
The greatest outrage experienced late in the trip is this: told on day one 'its first come first served' by the pool, (which is a nice area, and requires a key and gate locked from beach and sea, another disadvantage), no booking in advance, one hour allowed for breakfast and one hour for lunch I.e. No throwing a magazine or hat and walking off for the morning. A sign at the cafe writes up the rule. One morning I was up early went for a stroll by the front and sat on a chair by the pool. Low and behold the attendants passed and threw down 4 towels and reserved 4 beds in a prime location beside me! When I said I thought you couldn't book I was told 'first come first served' again, when I challenged where these people were, she said they came 7am, what a lie! I caught them at it!

Just a block back from the central main strip, Halekulani is superbly conveniently located without all the noise. The hotel is absolutely gorgeous and lives up to its legacy as one of the original luxurious properties in Waikiki. We stayed for three nights, and saw at least one wedding party take place on its grounds each day. The decor is modern and elegant, and the atmosphere is relaxed and calming. Staff is very professional and really friendly, assisting in however that they can. The room is spacious and all come with a balcony. The building is also designed in a U-shape so that majority of rooms enjoy an ocean view. There are lots of guest perks - including free access (including audio guides in some instances) to popular museums, daily complimentary heritage tour (including one that goes to their kitchen!), and others, so make sure you check with concierge. The only drawback is buffet breakfast at House Without A Key can quickly get crowded, and seating is slow.

Could be much better if a few pieces of equipment were added and some of the treadmills were removed. The hotel is in a great spot. Restaurants are good although LaMer is way over priced.

Still Same Outstanding Quality.","SHORT VERSION: Stayed May 21-29, 2017. In case you don't read this entire review, let me say up front that all the positive reviews are true. I've stayed here over 40 nights since 2003. I really do know what I'm talking about. In short: Stay here. Splurge on a Diamond Head Ocean View room. Sip cocktails and take in the Hawaiian music and classic Hula at House Without a Key at sunset.  Eat breakfast at Orchids (beautiful view and they actually wait on you...much more relaxed than the self-serve buffet at House Without a Key). Dine at Orchids or La Mer. You will have a grand time! Your soul will feel renewed! The entire hotel staff is second to none. They will treat you like royalty. You will be spoiled for anything else. If you want crowds and excitement (or less expensive options), just cross the street in front of the hotel...This is an IDEAL location, with none of the negatives of Waikiki. This is a WONDERUL hotel. We truly love it. AND...I assure you, It's still as good as it always was.

SO YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED: Don't expect a large (or even mid-sized) beach (not happening here...but you can walk a bit to get to one). Their pool is a decent size, heated and aesthetically gorgeous, but no hot tub. No water slides or water features. No zoo-like atmosphere. If you have children older than toddlers, or are looking to concentrate on beach activities, perhaps other hotels might better meet your needs. Only you know what is best for your family.

---Now for Details, if you have the time. Hope it helps you --------
 
SPECIAL THINGS:  Take the weekly Back of the House Tour, with Auntie Melba. It's fascinating! You find out what goes on behind the scenes to make it all work so seamlessly. Take the Historic Halekulani Tour with Hi'inani, where you'll get a 90-minute cultural and historic perspective on what makes this hotel so magically special. 

ROOM SELECTION: Go to the Halekulani's website and find the graphic that shows the layout of the hotel, with color-coded room category locations. It's really helpful. Get an idea of relative costs associated with different categories and packages.  Then, CALL the Halekulani's Reservations Department and make your arrangements through them directly. They can give you great insights as to best rates and specific room options. I'm glad I did, even though I am a multiple-repeat guest, because I was able to enter some special requests, as well as make sure I understood exactly what view I would have from what room.  They will be honest with you about rooms.

For example, some of the oceanfront category rooms are set back a bit, and you might not realize this. Some of the ocean view category rooms (and even partial ocean view) have generous to respectable views, so do ask for advice from these very friendly and knowledgeable reservation agents. It could save you money. But see next paragraph for MY ultimate room preference.

The Halekulani's balconies are very generously sized and furnished with a table and two chairs, plus a reclining lounger. It's always a pleasure to spend time on your balcony with a beautiful view. I HIGHLY recommend the Diamond Head Ocean Front View...it's breathtaking. It costs more, but it's just enchanting. We spent the first four nights in oceanfront, the last four nights in Diamond Head Ocean view. The latter view is definitely more than worth the price differential.

SURROUNDING AREA:  Understand going in that Waikiki is very crowded and built up, but you would never know that when you are actually AT this hotel.   It's completely serene and quiet.  Yet...you can walk across Kalia RD to Beach Walk (a shopping/dining area) in a matter of nano-seconds, and be right in the thick of everything...Hawaiian music groups performing free at Beach Walk pavilion, Roy's restaurant, Ruth Chris Steakhouse, Blue Ginger Apparel, Kahala Sportswear, Honolulu Cookie Company, Starbucks, etc. Scores of shops. A block further to ALL levels of shopping, from Gucci and Prada to Macy's. Long's Drug Store (CVS) and ABC stores nearby have all your travel needs very reasonably priced.  There's even a Denny's right in front of this hotel! I kid you not!!! You'll not run out of options for diversion. 

When we were there, the local Community College's Culinary School was just opening a little cafe/restaurant right across from the Halekulani in the Waikiki Parc Hotel (former site of the Nobu restaurant, and before that, the Waikiki Parc Cafe). The menu sounded great, and VERY reasonably priced. Wish we could have had a chance to sample it! If you can, go and support the budding chefs for us!

BEST TIMES TO STAY: Mid-to-latter part of May is a nice time to visit Hawaii. It is after the ""Golden Week"" in early May (when many Japanese guests travel because of three successive holidays within a 10-day period) and before the schools on the mainland USA let out. We've also found April and October/November/early to mid December to be less crowded in Hawaii (especially Waikiki) than other times. Watch out for the Honolulu Marathon, which is held early in December...that can complicate things somewhat.  As I said before, the great thing about the Halekulani is: No matter how crowded Waikiki gets, you always feel serene and relaxed when you're on the hotel's property. It's really true.

SECURITY AND RULE ENFORCEMENT:  When researching for this visit, I was dismayed to find a negative review, complaining that standards had slipped and security was less. I can honestly tell you that we found NO evidence of ANY such thing. The security guards (in black suits) are still on guard everywhere you look. No intruders are walking around the pool, having wandered in from the street or the beach. We felt completely safe, and we also never saw ANY hint of smoking on balconies. There are a few designated smoking areas (one in front of the hotel, on the street). Other than that, the guests honored the no-smoking policy of the hotel...at least as far as we could see. Considering we spent over a week here, and I really checked for all of this, I feel confident in assuring all of you that everything is STILL just as genteel, safe, pleasant, clean, and quiet as it always was here.  And THAT is saying something.

CONCIERGES:   The Concierges will do ANYTHING for you. They can pull rabbits out of hats, and DO, with great regularity. And they are not there to sell tours or tickets. They are there for the guests, and your best interests are their only concern. They provided me with packing materials and shipped my packages, steered me toward some of the best experiences, took care of everything. And I never had to wait to speak with them, like at so many other hotels. There are always several concierges on duty, and they are at it from morning until 10 p.m. every night. They seem able to get you reservations at almost any restaurant, sometimes even last-minute. Amazing service!

CONCLUSION: Stay here, even if you have to save up for a long time (like we do). It's worth it. There is a level of luxury and service here that is beyond that of ANY other Waikiki hotel. You will be treated to multiple excellent food options (with elegant ambiance), highly personalized service, outstanding spa services, and a large, comfortable room. Get an ocean view room, whatever you do...preferably on a high floor, above any rooftops. You didn't come all the way to Hawaii to look at anything less.","Date of stay: May 2017","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We enjoyed the proximity to restaurants, shops and the beach, attentive staff and manicured grounds. We had an ocean view room which was decorated in relaxing colours, was comfortable (though not overly large), with a direct view across the pool and sea. The pool area and the strip of beach by the hotel were never busy whilst we were there. We ate breakfasts a couple of times in each breakfast location, choice was varied and we thought both were good depending on our preference for restaurant and buffet or waiter service. We also dined in the evening in both House Without a Key and Orchids and rate both highly on food and service. We found the Concierge desk helpful including booking a hire car which was delivered to the hotel.

Watch out for the daily pre-charge on your credit card, this may be usual for Hawaii, but is not usual to that extent in other countries.

Always met with a smile and willingness to help by staff no matter which part of the hotel they worked at.
The food is also quite good, especially the waffles at breakfast. The service at the restaurants and pool area was also very friendly yet professional and everyone is quite knowledgeable not only about the hotel but about Hawaii and its culture.

Comfortable. Outstanding.","Everything written before by other Tripadvisor reviewers sums it up: Halekulani is THE best place to stay on Waikiki. Yes, you pay accordingly, but it is worth every cent. Why? The staff - from the guys beside the pool to the brilliant housekeeping. It's the little things that make a difference; and every night a small gift is left for you to dwell on what's important in life. By the way, please remember to leave a tip each day for the housekeeping staff; they deserve it and are too often forgotten. (I left $10 on the bed each day as that's what I was advised was appropriate).
Halekulani is not for young people who want to make a loud noise! This is popular with baby boomers and honeymooners who want to sit back quietly and savour the serenity beside the pool - especially on the  grass under the frangipani trees.
Forget breakfast in 'House without a Key' unless u enjoy the pandemonium of ppl helping themselves to various types of foods while pushing and shoving; the only civilised place to have breakfast is in the elegant 'Orchids' restaurant where you sit back and are waited upon.If you have breakfast included in your package, this is the best place to have it. The Bircher muesli is the best I have ever tasted!
Just down the road is one of the most versatile ABC (bit like 7-11 for Aussies, only superior) shops that sells the most delicious selection of salads and sandwiches. And anything else you could possibly need!

Serenity","Firstly the location of this hotel is perfect. You are right on the beach 2 minutes from the craziness of the Waikiki beach but then the hotel and pool are in a locked private area that makes you feel like you are miles away from the tourists and mayhem.
It's beautiful and relaxing.
We've done a bit of travelling around Hawaii staying at the Westin, Turtle bay, Hyatt etc all 5 stars and this is by far the best.
It's the little thing the hotel does that makes a difference, for example I said it was my birthday 3 days ago and I got a surprise bottle of champagne delivered to my room. Your sunbeds are made for you, you get a little gift on your pillow at night, the house cleaning actually cleans and makes sure things are left well presented.
The service is great. The guy on the main desk was so welcoming and I think it was down to him he made my birthday feel a little more special.

The air breezing through is the best of all. My room with a balcony and a partial view of  the ocean is what I want most in  hotel. It's right on the water. If you want to learn to surf, go early before the crowds. After that, the hotel's very large pool is a respite from the noise. The pool attendants will take care of you. They advised me not to leave my things on the beach.  The restaurant is right there with a cascade of fresh fruit and vegetables. AND when you are ready to splurge on coconut cake, it seems to be as clean and void of artificial ingredients as Whole Foods. This is the cleanest food I've ever found in a hotel.  Sadly, Hawaii has one of  the highest rates of drug addiction and found that to be true with some cab drivers and shop keepers. With car rental companies charging  customers with undeserved fees, I tend  to walk a lot. There are  some maps for walking trails on their web site which I plan to try on my next visit.","Date of stay: July 2016","Trip type: Traveled with friends","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

It is also expensive and I am not sure it is worth the high fee. Do not get me wrong, it is a very nice hotel but I think for the money, there are better alternatives.

Positives. 
1. Pool area is excellent as was the service around it (eg drinks, towels etc)
2. The casual dining at House without a Key was pleasant as was the entertainment at 6pm. Well worth going down for a cocktail and view of the beach.
3. Position, just out of the hustle and bustle of the main area but within an easy walking distance to all the fun.
4. Easy beach access

Negatives
1. To me, and this is only a personal opinion, the hotel room was looking a little dated - still clean but just a little old.
2. For the amount of money spent, there are better options. We also stayed at the Trump, which was cheaper and much more modern. Depends on what you like, obviously.","Date of stay: May 2017","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

The hotel is an oasis of serenity amidst the bustle of Waikiki.

Every employee we encountered, from reception (a warm, personalized welcome) to the concierge staff (friendly and efficient) to the various bartenders and waitstaff (cheerful and accommodating) to housekeeping and valets, was absolutely top-notch.

Melba, especially, was a joy to meet and befriend.  She's a Halekulani treasure and an institution - she knows everyone and her back-of-house tour is not to be missed.  We're glad to call her 'Aunty' and are looking forward to seeing her again soon.

Drinks at L'Aperitif (superb bartending by Henry!) and dinner at La Mer were wonderful.  The restaurant compares favorably with other true fine dining establishments and we enjoyed our meal there very much.

In summary, our experience at Halekulani was a pleasure from beginning to end and we plan to return annually, if not more often.","Date of stay: May 2017","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The beach is the size of a postage stamp so don't stay here if you want to enjoy Waikiki Beach.

It is located right on the beach in the middle of Waikiki, but on a quiet street off of the main drag with the bulk of the crowds. Unlike some other Hawaii resort properties, it doesn't wow you with fancy decorations or giant pools. Rather, it gets all of the small details right: front desk is efficient and personable- never waited; the concierges are top-notch and can get anything done for you (they even took care of mailing a package we had); you want a rental car: they will have one brought right to the front of the hotel when you want it- and thoughtfully put in beach towels in the car for the day; elevators are fast and we never waited more than 30 seconds; the service is there only when you want it, and does exactly what you want without being pushy.

The rooms are comfortable- not giant, but perfect for two people, especially with a large balcony (lanai) looking over the pool and ocean. Everything- just works: pretty flowers, comfortable bed, great shower, big bathtub. The hotel is Japanese-owned, and about half of guests are Japanese- perhaps explaining the attention to detail.

The House Without a Key restaurant has evening Hawaiian music and hula- not your typical cheesy entertainment like at some places, but very elegant, very good musicians, beautiful hula dancer- all with the ocean in the background- well worth drinks or dinner one night.

With all that... you will pay for it. It's considered one of the most expensive hotels in Oahu- but they earn it.","Date of stay: May 2017","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Our wedding size was pretty small (~45 guests) and we had a fairly limited budget. We also had to do all of our planning virtually as our schedules didn't allow for us to visit the locations in person before the wedding.

After talking to what seemed like every possible venue in Honolulu, we settled on Halekulani as they were by far the most responsive and were willing to work with us on our wedding size and budget. We worked with Loren for the most part and we were very thankful for her help. Most other venues took days or even weeks to respond to our questions. Loren usually responded right away and never lost patience with us even though we had a million questions and requests. We had to go without a wedding planner due to budgetary reasons. Without Loren's help, I'm not sure if we would have been able to pull it off.

We ended up going with the Hau Terrace location as it offered the most privacy and had an amazing outdoor ceremony area with an ocean view. This venue is meant to fit a larger group so we did have to spend a bit more than we would have liked to in order to meet the minimum requirements, but Loren did work with us to help us get as close to our budget as we could.

On our wedding day, the rest of the staff was just as helpful as Loren. Everything was set up and arranged exactly as we had requested. They allowed us to check in early so we would have more time to prepare. We were upgraded to a nicer room when they saw that the room we booked wasn't ready yet. There was always someone keeping us updated on any potential issues and just making sure everything went according to our plan. We even had someone that was dedicated to taking care of just my wife and I throughout the reception. He held up our food when he saw that we were busy so they wouldn't go cold sitting on the table, he made sure we remembered to eat when we had a free moment (we didn't have many free moments), and he even packed up some food for us at the end of the night after seeing that we didn't get a chance to eat much. We missed most of the food but our guests told us that everything from the cocktail hour appetizers to the dinner courses were just amazing.

Overall, the beautiful venue itself would have been enough, but the service of the staff, especially Loren, is what really put it over the top for us.","Date of stay: October 2016","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We enjoy it because it is smaller and quieter than some of the very large well known national chain hotels. We had a Diamond Head view room which was perfect for really feeling like we were in Hawaii. The room itself was a comfortable size but not huge. However, this is Hawaii and you are rarely in your room anyway. The bathroom was large although the shower was a bit snug. There is a soaking tub, and if you choose, you can open the closet doors between the bathroom and the bedroom for the view while you soak in the tub. There is a separate water closet which my husband and I find very helpful.

What makes this hotel special though is how they take care of their guests. No matter the job someone has at the Halekulani, they are trained to be polite and take care of your needs, a much different experience than dealing with people who are just hired to do a job. Housekeeping does an excellent job and were flexible with their time when we asked them to leave the room so we could change. They did not make us feel that we were inconveniencing them. The weekly Manager's Cocktail Party provides a chance to meet other guests as well as share your comments about the hotel with the managers of the various departments. The pool staff is also attentive and they provide light snacks at certain times of the day such as mini muffins, ice cream, and frozen chocolate covered banana slices. Everything is done to make your stay calm, relaxing, and enjoyable. We received special considerations for our 25th wedding anniversary: a complementary bottle of champagne in our room and a complementary dessert at the hotel restaurant, Orchids; their signature coconut cake on a plate decorated for the occasion. 

There are three restaurants on site and each is special in it's own way. Our waiters at Orchids were very helpful and attentive, and the hostess at the House Without a Key called us by name every time she saw us. There is also entertainment every night at the House Without a Key, a small band playing Hawaiian music and a hula dancer.  Even if you choose not to eat here, having a cocktail while watching the show is a wonderful experience as the sun sets. The third restaurant is the only 5-star restaurant on the island so expect very high costs. They have relaxed their ""jackets required for men"" rule. Personally I think that is a shame but as the world becomes more casual, they didn't have a choice.

If you want a beach though, this is not the place to stay. They do have a postage stamp size beach but all beaches in Hawaii are public so don't expect much here. The pool at this hotel is the place to spend your day.

Overall, this is a comfortable yet upscale hotel.  If you want a special experience and are willing to pay for it, this is THE place to stay in Waikiki.","Date of stay: April 2017","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We have never been  disappointed by our decision to stay at this hotel.

The staff, from reception and cashier, to the pool/towel attendants and drink servers, to the various house managers, to the housekeeping and maintenance people, are ALL professional, courteous, friendly, and helpful. We believe this is a testament to the character of the people they hire and the training they receive to ensure all guests are exceedingly satisfied.

Our room was spacious (one of the more expensive rooms) and the room and bathroom were attended to in the morning and in the evening and all used towels were always replaced with fresh.

The property is immaculately maintained and ""security"" people are always on the lookout for guest safety.

We did not eat at their La Mer restaurant this visit, but we did have dinner at Orchids one night (excellent food, service, and ambience) and House without a Key three times (good food and service with excellent entertainment and ambience).

Valet parking is a bit expensive at approximately $40/day (and we were there for 7-nights). But that is to be expected in the heart of Waikiki where parking is at a premium.

We had to move rooms after one night as the people on either side of us were smoking on their balconies (tobacco and cannabis) which meant that we couldn't open up our balcony doors. Even though smoking is prohibited on the property, the hotel clearly puts up with it and does little to enforce the rules.
The other problem with the hotel is the lack of security. Anyone off the street can just walk in and walk around the pool area, even though there are signs saying that only hotel guests are permitted around the pool.
We witnessed many groups of people using the pool who were not guests and when this was brought to the attention of the Pool manager, Thomas, he said he knew they weren't guests but...""it was a grey area"" 
We even had some drug affected people walk in of the street and ask me, whilst i was in the pool, if they could swim in the pool naked. When this was brought to the attention of one of the pool attendants, Doug, he said ""well, there is a wedding going on, they could be guests!"" Clearly, they were not. 
With this security issue, you can't swim in the pool without worrying about your belongings being stolen and also, the hotel loses its exclusivity by turing a blind eye to the general public using the pool and guest only facilities.
The hotel has lost it's exclusivity. I would not stay here again. It's definitely not worth the expense.","Date of stay: April 2017","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

The room is sparkling clean, the bed is very comfortable and there isn't anything to complain about except finding the switches to turn the lamp lights off.

There was no blaring music at the pool area. Thank goodness!

The bar and jazz was romantic and classy. How nice to sit in a bar and listen to music without a TV. Imagine. We had a conversation.
My only complaint was at one of our dinners. The young woman who was very affable and attentive, but unsophisticated, brought our red wine out in a wine bucket. Uh. No.
And then after we ordered our food, the entree came out at the same time as the appetizer. Methinks she needed a bit more training!

We'd read that watching the sunset from here was a must, so we figured we'd try it. 

Drinks were expensive, but not unusually so. They were also very strong, so a little went a long way! I lived the lemonade with mint and the mai tais got rave reviews. 

The appetizers were very expensive ($16 for 4 shrimp) and not great. Stick with the drinks. 

The service was superb and so friendly. They took all the pictures we wanted and we're just so friendly. 

There's a $5 charge per person but we were fine paying it for the great seat and the music and island dancing. 

There is a dress  code, but some of us only had shorts and t-shirts and they were let in with no problem. 

Our group also got a huge kick k out of the Japanese toilets, which spray and dry your nether regions. There were a lot of giggles coming from the stalls.

It is not, however, a five-star property.  Five-star hotels have personal butlers (St. Regis), multiple pools, beach or other family fun facilities (Four Seasons, Ritz-Carlton) and lots of little unexpected perks that make the guest experience memorable.  We found ourselves noticing the absence of these five-star attributes.  There was no beach department with surfboards, etc. to rent and instructors to hire -- we went next door to the Sheridan.  There was no hot tub, the pool is old, and the pool staff were visibly annoyed when I did not tip daily (it's my practice to do so at the end of my stay).  The food was very expensive, even by Waikiki standards.  Had the Halekulani held itself out as a four-star property, and priced its rooms accordingly, I could have overlooked most of these deficiencies.  But to earn five stars a hotel has to deliver a really special guest experience, and that did not happen during our stay.","Date of stay: April 2017","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

Please note that due to recent storms, there is no longer a beach to speak of.

They had our room originally on the higher floor but we arrived earlier than the check In time and were offered a room a the 2nd floor which is fine by us. I mean who wants to stay in their rooms when you are in Honolulu ? There are so many things to see and beaches to visit . The one thing about this place is they have a great pool and unlike many other hotels you do not have to reserve or pay for the lounge chairs . They have a small secluded but public beach . Tiny . Just infant of the pool with no beach chair which is fine by us . 
The services were outstanding especially the concierge. check in and check out were swift. You have 2 restaurants for breakfast , Orchid and House without a Key . We only ate at the latter which is a buffet breakfast but you can order your own eggs ( we only like egg white omelets ) which is nice. Breakfast selections were pretty small. 
One of the greatest things about this hotel is the location . It's very central and there are tons of stores and restaurants near by yet it's very peaceful and quiet . 
They also give you title gifts nightly at turn downs .

Those expectations were easily surpassed.
This is probably one of the finest hotels we have stayed in. The service is exemplary, from concierge, reception, restaurants, room service and housekeeping. Housekeeping rarely gets a mention in any reviews but I have to say the attention to detail in the cleaning of the rooms & the unobtrusive, yet efficient , housekeeping staff were outstanding.
This hotel is simply a truly wonderful experience. The staff simply cannot do enough for you- every request answered swiftly and courteously. The rooms themselves have beautiful views across Waikik beach and/or Diamond Head, are of a very good size with large bathrooms & very comfortable beds. 
I would also highlight the Spa which is extremely good- the therapists appear to have been at the hotel many years, are most charming and provide first class treatments.
One slight drawback- the beach area is very small but larger beaches are within easy walking distance. Anyway, the pool area makes up for any beach deficiencies.
Obviously,this is not an inexpensive hotel, but, my goodness, it is worth splashing out on whilst in Hawaii. An exceptional experience.","Date of stay: April 2017","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

They're resourceful and very informative. Their services added a touch of perfection to our stay. 

Room:
We had a room with ocean view on 9th floor and the view was decent. I've added a picture from the balcony (lounge chair + regular chair and table) for a visual. 
There was fresh fruit for us (see pic) - nice touch. There's a dividing door between bathroom and bedroom built in within the closet. Pretty cool design. You get complimentary bottled water and ice. There is NO coffee/tea maker in the room, although there's complimentary coffee at House Without Key restaurant on main floor. 
Restaurants - open their doors between 7AM & 7:30AM for breakfast (see note above re coffee/tea). Afternoon tea @3pm. 
Primary Investment Focus for this hotel were rooms, shops, restaurants, etc. The beach and pool were secondary.  

Service is wonderful and folks go the extra mile to make your stay flawless. Enjoy!

Tips: 1) have change $5, $10, singles denominations readily available for tipping folks. 2) Waikiki city can be pricey. There are ABC stores (like discount stores) all over the island and you may purchase just about anything there for reasonable prices, including food, liquor, clothing, etc. and save money. 3) first week of April, places were running at roughly 60% capacity which helped with services and crowds. Not rainy and weather was perfect.  4) there's no iron in room or coffee/tea maker, so be prepared to pay for this purchase or service if needed. 
5) the private beach for the hotel is small & no beach chairs available, so bring your own. Folks mostly surf here. If interested in laying in the sand, ask for a net & towel (see pic) to lay one on. 6) pool has salted warm water and you can sit on pool lounge chairs closest to the beach to have best of both worlds, at the pool or poolside with ocean wave sounds in background- loved this.

I have not felt so relaxed on vacation since our honeymoon, 7 years ago! We were upgraded to an ocean view room, and the view was absolutely spectacular! My husband and I stood on our balcony the first morning for a good 30 minutes just to take in the view. We can only imagine what the view of the ocean front rooms look like! 
This property is beautifully maintained and away from the hustle and bustle of the main Waikiki strip. Staff at the Halekulani are warm, friendly and eager to help make your stay as wonderful as possible. The complimentary water, and snacks at the pool as well as the little gifts at turn-down every night was a lovely touch to our stay.  
The only downside to this hotel is how thin the walls are. We can hear the pipes when our neighbours turn on the showers, and there were a couple of nights where we were able here people talking very clearly next door. However, this did not deter us from sleeping throughout the night.
Although staying at this hotel does comes with a large price tag, I would definitely recommend this hotel to those who are thinking of splurging a bit on their next vacation.

There is something about staying at the Halekulani that gives you a place of refuge from all that high energy of Waikiki.

We were accommodated in Diamond Head Ocean View rooms. As the name implies your view was generous and of Waikiki Beach and the afore mentioned iconic landmark. Simply beautiful. In the early morning light to watch the sun rise and the dawn patrol of surfers paddling out is a great welcome to a new day.

The staff is warm, friendly and professional. They never fail to greet you with a warm Aloha.

One of the old classic hotels in Honolulu, it is an oasis of calm in the madness of Waikiki.

We had a spectacular ocean front room, the view could not be beat.

Pluses for this hotel:

- fantastic service from everyone
- calm and quiet on a dead end road in Waikiki and never seems to get noisy
- close to everything in Waikiki, restaurants and shopping.
- the views are fantastic if you book the right class of room.
- great pool area
- hotel restaurants (orchids, la mer and house without a key) have awesome food and service
- nightly traditional Hawaiian music is so enjoyable to bring a close to a great day
- right on the beach.
- pool staff are attentive, hard working and look after you, ie Chris
- love the little gifts they give at turn down service
- grounds and hotel are beautifully maintained 
- they bring treats around the pool all day
- comfortable beds and room

Downsides:

- pay attention to the room class you book.   On their website, they show which room class is located where in the hotel.
- for the price point, the rooms are dated, especially the bathrooms.","Date of stay: March 2017","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

The hotel itself is very nice. Clean larger rooms with balconies overlooking the pacific. The location is in the middle of everything on Waikiki Beach. Because of recent erosion there is not much of a beach for the hotel itself, but an easy 3 minute walk towards Diamond Head brings you to a large beach where you can hang for the day.

Here are the pros and cons, in my opinion.

The price is very high compared to other 4-5 star  hotels on the island.   The small pool area seems to always be a mob scene - never enough pool chairs and their private beach area is very small.  The rooms are average for ammenities - although the size of the suites are good and the rooms with a Diamond Head view are beautiful.  

I love the fact that they do an afternoon tea as well as a Sunday brunch.  La Mer is outstanding, but plan on paying $300+ per couple.  Both Orchids and Room Without a Key are good options for onsite dining and Lewers in the evening for a cocktail and some jazz really sets a nice tone for the end of the evening.  

The hotel is proximate to shopping and the service from the staff is warm, but not a phony type of friendly - professional and  knowledgeable about the area. 

Overal, a very nice hotel if you are willing to dig deep into your pocketbook for a once in a lifetime Hawaii experience - but if you visit Hawaii regularly, probably not worth the money.","Date of stay: January 2017","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Our expectations were high, we had just spent 7 weeks travelling the world staying at 5 star hotels all over yet the Halekulani was to be the most expensive hotel that we were to stay at during our previous 4 weeks travelling in USA.

The property is well maintained and welcoming, and our partial oceanview room was adequate though in need of an update. The main issue with the room was the noise - it was so noisy staying there. Every morning from around 530am I was woken by the sound of trucks; garbage trucks, trucks idling, trucks reversing with that non-stop warning beep. The sliding glass doors at the hotel were single glazed and the room didn't have any curtains (only timber plantation shutters), double glazing and/ or heavy curtains would have helped. The room carpet was old and stained and the bathroom was clean enough but dated. The pool area was overcrowded, probably about 150 lounge chairs around a pool that isn't large for the size and occupancy of the hotel. We stayed almost a week yet during that time we never saw more than two waiters servicing the pool area each day so they were simply run off their feet. Service as in housekeeping was a bit hit or miss too, we ran out of bathroom products on day 4 as they failed to replace them at all. Definitely don't choose to stay if you want to lie on the beach as the beach is tiny, pretty much cut off from the hotel and difficult to get to other than through a small gate on the side of the pool area. We ate in the House without a Key restaurant, the Caesar Salad $14, when half a chicken breast is added increases by $12 to USD$26. Fresh Lemonade USD$8. The experience and quality just fell far short of the pricing and the expectation that comes with it. The staffing to guest ratio falls short of where this hotel should be, the staff appear over-stretched and fraught.

One wonderful thing that the hotel does offer is complimentary art and cultural tours which is a great initiative and very enjoyable.

All up this review probably seems picky but this hotel is seriously expensive and the basic room cost almost twice as much as a 750sq ft one bedroom suite at the stunning San Francisco Ritz Carlton did 2 weeks earlier so we are talking expensive. At that price the Halekulani needs to be much, much better. I would say this hotel is more of a well kept 4 star property, and it is most certainly overpriced. I left feeling disappointed.","Date of stay: January 2017","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

A lovely old world hotel, beachfront with maybe 5m of beach available to use","This hotel is lovely although it was not the experience we hoped for and has a few things to look at to provide a real 5 star experience. We arrived from 5 nights at the Four seasons in Maui with outstanding service and care which only served to highlight their lacking. There wasn't a lei on arrival, no alohas anywhere and no mahalos unless we intitiated them, all things that which makes Hawaiian hotels special. We could have been at any good hotel. They did place small presents  on the bed with beautiful quotes on message cards which were lovely. We had a junior ocean suite which accommodated my husband and I with our 9yo son in a rollaway. The room was lovely although ocean views were through the low buildings of the hotel. It advertised 2 lanai's/balconies although one was only a step out to see Diamond Head. We did have a few electrical issues in the room with lights turning off randomly and the sound system glitching. As we weren't there to watch TV, it didn't affect our stay. The pool is lovely and of a reasonable size for Honolulu but the boys were not allowed to play catch with their small ball which definitely affected our experience there. All restaurants overlook the ocean. Their top restaurant La Mer was outstanding but of course very expensive as Hawaii's only 5 diamond restaurant. Orchids was lovely and had a nice ambience to it, with ala a carte breakfast, lunch and dinner and dress code. Room without a Key is their casual near the pool restaurant and was disappointing both in service, food quality and range of food, although the breakfast buffet was ok. My husbands caesar salad was eclipsed by the one he'd had the day before at the very low priced Denny's over the road. To their credit when they were informed of the poor quality of the chicken, the food services manager apologised profusely and did not charge us for the meal. The poolside menu was very limited.

Can I start by saying you've stolen our hearts?

We stayed at the Halekulani for two weeks in December of 2016 over Christmas, and again during the final leg of our Hawai'i vacation in January. Words barely suffice in expressing the beauty that Halekulani embodies in every imaginable way, but being a writer, I shall attempt it. 

Walking into the hotel, you are flooded by light. Architecturally, there is a perfect symbiosis between the gifts Mother Nature provides, and the building structure. When entering your guest room, the inviting atmosphere continues in the beautifully appointed details of what will constitute your living space for the duration of your stay. There is a saying that goes, ""There is a crack in everything. That's how the Light gets in."" To describe the Halekulani, I would change that slightly, to ""There is Love in everything. That's how the Light gets in."" From the decor of the rooms, to the gifts you receive on a nightly basis, to the kindness of the staff, love truly permeates every aspect of the Halekulani. That's the true Spirit of aloha. 

We did a bit of island hopping during our Hawai'i vacation, and we are also globetrotters that have stayed at some of the best hotels. We can honestly say that no hotel anywhere can compare to the Halekulani. We will think back to our time here with such love, gratitude and fondness. You guys are amazing. We will always return to you, and we know it will feel like coming home. Mahalo nui loa!","Date of stay: December 2016","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Everything was clean, discrete and relaxing. We had a hard time understanding the people at the first hotel and other places in Honolulu. People talk very fast in Honolulu but not at the ""Halekulani"". They make you feel relaxed and cozy. 
The hotel also had everything you needed. Cleanliness, practicality and luxury. Situated at the Waikiki Beach you had direct access to the beach and the beach walk. On the other hand, it was in the middle of the shopping area. The hotel staff pampered you while you were staying there. For example, they had free coffee in the mornings outside by the poolside. And when you were lying outside by the pool, they came and offered you a fruit or a cake. 
The poolside beds were taken care of by the staff before you wanted to use them. Complimentary!!!
Their breakfast was also very delicious. They have a continental and a full breakfast. The continental was more simple but it had everything and more than what we needed. 
The staff are well trained and it just makes you feel safe, relaxed and comfortable. I would definitely stay here again if I come to Honolulu and would highly recommend it to others.","Date of stay: December 2016","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

If you are looking for a luxury resort with personal service and attention to detail, please do look elsewhere. I would also be very wary of the flattering reviews in this board - they bear no resemblance to the experience we had during our stay. We would have moved out if we could but the hotel insisted we pre-pay the entire bill before arriving due to the 'peak season.'

The hotel is crowded (with mainly Japanese tourists), high-density with impersonal, perfunctory service. We stayed for 10 days but no one took the trouble to remember you or greet you or even smile at you (not the reception, concierge, waiters). Breakfast at Orchids is an obstacle course - before being seated you not only have to inform them of your room number but also spell out your name (first and surname) while they look you up often without success on a computer. When there is a queue the whole process takes ages. It felt like an economy class check in every morning just to get breakfast. 

One morning it took us a whole hour to get food/breakfast on the table at Orchids - 20 mins to wait for a table, 20 mins to find someone to take your order, and another 20 mins for the food to arrive. And this was when the restaurant was half-empty. The place just does not have enough wait staff to cope with the work load and the staff are not at all well trained.

The breakfast at the buffet style alternative (House Without A Key)  is even worse - long queues at the buffet, tables placed close together which isnt pleasant when you have wailing babies at the next table as we did on our first morning. There is no question of a relaxing breakfast or friendly personal service from wait staff that you get at other proper luxury resorts. 

Sleep quality - the beds are not good quality and the mattress dips in the middle. Pillows are not comfortable either. The rooms do not have blinds or curtains - only plantation shutters that let in the light - so without eye shades there is no question of sleeping in after 6 or 7am if you wanted to.

Housekeeping is perfunctory. Two main lights in our suite's sitting room were not working when we checked in (rendering the room half dim at night) and were still out 5 days later when we finally asked them to fix them. Noone bothered to check before or after we checked in. The maids turn down service has this peculiar habit of turning ON the giant plasma TV in the bedroom and some strange night light under the nightstands, so if you are returning late to your room you have to hunt high and low for controls to switch them off before retiring. The night light defers all logic and is not connected to any master or other switch that a mortal being can find.

The concierge is patchy and staff changes every day. We did get a couple of good restaurant recommendations; otherwise the concierge is only fair and at times bad. A request to book dinner at a casual sports bar nearby was met with ""it should be fine for you to walk in"". We did and had to wait 30 mins in the rain for a table. All because our concierge couldnt be bothered to make a phone call.

One concierge sent us to a truly awful polynesian/magic show at the Holiday Inn with cafeteria style seating, inedible food and an Elvis impersonator/singer. I just could not believe the concierge of a luxury hotel would think their guests would enjoy this. There is no question that the concierge can get priority tables at popular places for guests as they do in proper luxury hotels - our booking for Alan Wong was only obtained after 8 days. Our request for tickets to the Jurassic-Kualoa (made the day we arrived) was unsuccessful - in the end a friendly chauffeur with good contacts managed to get us tickets but NOT the hotel concierge.

The hotel beach is tiny, almost non-existent. The pool is small too and again the service there is perfunctory. There is nowhere pleasant to hang out to have a drink or dessert after 10pm - the restaurants and poolside shuts down after 1015pm and the lounge provided for evening drinks is a claustrophobic place (no view or windows) with very few tables. There are 6 tables in a paviilion facing the courtyard (not the sea/pool) for evening drinks but they are often full and service is achingly slow.

Halekulani is not a luxury hotel and is poor value for money - it is too high density, and the service is at best fair at worst poor. In the Christmas season when we stayed, the place is teeming with hundreds of Japanese tourists and often feels almost like an Asian conference centre rather than a luxury resort. If you're looking for a pampering relaxing stay, opt for the Kahala (which I really wish we had) or one of the other islands.","Date of stay: December 2016","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

The location right of the beach is splendid, and you are also very close to the shopping areas and restaurants of Waikiki.
My last stay was in a beautiful Ocean View room with wonderful vistas over the hotel pool and Diamond Head. The décor of the rooms is very tastefully done, and fits perfectly with the tropical environment.
I have always found the staff at check-in and in the restaurants to be very professional and friendly, as you should expect in a property with such high standards – nothing is too much trouble and you always receive a smile.
The hotel pool is nice, although could perhaps be a little bigger for the size of the hotel, the small beach at the front of the hotel is exactly that, small. Great for swimming and I preferred the beach to the pool.
Dining options abound and my personal favourite being House without a Key – beautiful surrounds, wonderful views and very relaxing no matter the time of day. Breakfasts here are among the very best I have had anywhere.
I would return to the Halekulani in a heartbeat – the hotel is sublime, has wonderful service, beautiful rooms, a brilliant location and is just perfect in my book.","Date of stay: October 2016","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Upon entering the hotel,one is immediately struck by the quiet and peaceful setting of the hotel. It is an oasis of quiet and solitude apart from the hustle and bustle on Waikiki. Check in is efficient. We stayed in a beautiful room looking out over the ocean, Waikiki Beach and straight opposite Diamond Head. The view was iconic. 

As to the room itself, it was not particularly large but it was very nicely appointed. The huge floor to ceiling sliding glass door open onto a veranda with a chaise and small table and chairs. The room itself is very light and bright- white bedding, white tiles in the bathroom. The room's decor, however, is irrelevant to the stupendous view from our room.  The bed was incredibly comfortable, always a requirement for a first class hotel. 

As far as service, the Halekalani is top notch. An example: I left the book I was reading in our car which was in valet parking. I asked the concierge if she could possibly have someone get my book and within 10 minutes she was walking across the grass area in front of the pool, located me and handed me my book. Stupendous.

Quite simply I will only stay at the Halekalani when I visit Honolulu. The hotel is excellent in every respect.","Date of stay: December 2016","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

While Oahu in general, but especially Waikiki, is very busy and more city-like than the other islands, this hotel was nice to come back to at the end of the day since it felt a tad removed from the craziness of the city once you stepped inside. It wasn't too loud even though it was so close to everything. 

There isn't much privacy unless you have a suite that specifically looks out only onto the ocean. All other rooms/suites look out onto one another even if they have a garden or ocean view. But the views are pretty nice especially if you have an ocean view. And if you have a garden view then you will likely get to see a wedding or two during your stay! During our three days there we saw three even though we were there from Saturday afternoon through Tuesday morning. When speaking with the manager who escorted us to our room I inquired about weddings there out of curiosity since it was a pretty location, and he mentioned that due to their proximity to Japan they have Japanese weddings nearly every other day. So you may get to see a beautiful bride walking around taking pictures!

During our time there we didn't have a chance to check out the restaurants since we have a lot of activities scheduled, but the atmosphere at the restaurants looked really lovely. I would have enjoyed an afternoon tea there since the veranda where they host this was really beautiful. 

There is not direct access onto the beach from the hotel pool area, but there is easy access just a short walk down the street. And there are lots of shops and restaurants within easy walking distance as well. And most activities are a quick drive from the hotel, so we were able to go see Pearl Harbor, Germaine's Luau, North Shore, and other fun places without too much trouble.

If you're staying here you definitely need to go check out Leonard's bakery close by for some Malasadas one morning! And The Pig and the Lady is close by as well, a great dinner spot. 

The staff at the hotel was very kind and eager to assist with our needs. The valet/porter staff was especially wonderful! They were always ready with a smile and hello when we were leaving or returning, offering bottles of water and towels. And if we had to wait a little while for our vehicle to be brought around they were always pleasant to speak with. There was one gentleman in particular who connected with us because he asked us where we were from and when we said Dallas, TX he told us he was a big Dallas Cowboys fan and proceeded to talk football with my husband. What a nice touch to find something in common with a guest and make them feel welcome!

Overall our trip here was very pleasant. I would have given it a 5 instead of a 4 but I didn't feel that the room and amenities were excellent. I was disappointed to not see Room Service as an option. If they do offer this it wasn't clearly available in the in-room information. But I would still certainly recommend this hotel and return myself!","Date of stay: November 2016","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

I cannot think of a better hotel on Waikiki - unless the touch of history at the Royal Hawaiian puts that in first place (I'm also writing a review for them).

The Halekulani is ON the beach (unlike the Trump Waikiki), but the beach is quite small.  Good for them, though, as the hotels on either side have lost their beaches.  The pool ends up being more enjoyable than the beach.  For the wide Waikiki beach from the movies, you'd have to go farther towards Diamond Head.

Our upgraded room was just typical, and the balconies face each other so there's no privacy.  There's at least one wedding a day - and as the hotel is Japanese-owned, most guests are not USA-mainlanders.  

There are three restaurants, and two serve breakfast.  We recommend the one off a menu and skip the buffet.  All three serve dinner off a menu - and we recommend the mid-range one called Orchids.  The higher cuisine La Mer is good but not so much better to deserve the very high prices.  

Every evening there is live entertainment outside, including dancers, and it's very pleasant.  

The Waikiki strip is very close and tons of shopping and restaurants, but don't forget that two lots east is the Army Museum of the Pacific - a must see!","Date of stay: November 2016","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

One staff member told us it would be ready asap but when we checked a couple of hours later another staff member said it would not be ready until the 3pm check in time.

We had very high expectations to say the least. We had reserved an ocean view room but then before we arrived were upgraded to an ocean front room at a rate of $655 per night for two people. Upon our arrival we were promptly greeted but as expected our room was not ready so we spent time walking around the pool area and relaxing in the lobby. The lobby is very beautiful as I had expected it would be. Once our room was ready, we were escorted to it by an employee. We were given a room on the third floor. the minute we stepped off the elevator I was surprised to see how dowdy the hallway was, reminded me of a holiday inn in the 70's. dark, worn out carpet & marked up walls. the room was tiny & just as worn out. we faced the pool and very limited ocean view, for sure did not meet our definition of ocean front. I asked the employee who brought us to the room if the higher floors had better views (as the pics on their website showed) and he barely even responded. I decided to call front desk and tell them I wasn't very happy about our room...they didn't even ask me why, much less offer to show me other rooms. The could have cared less! So we checked out & I want to tell you this....the silver lining to this story is that we called the Four Seasons at Ko Olina, formerly the JW Marriott, and moved there...what a stunning property it is!!! that is a whole other review coming up. take your money to the Four Seasons and forget the Halekulani....it is a ""has been"" property.","Date of stay: October 2016","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_20"

My main gripe is for the price you expect a polished experience this whole way, and it fell well short. The check in expedience was lackluster. Each time we arrived or left the hotel the concierge/greeting team were huddled in their own group and often didn't acknowledge you. The hotel is beginning to look tired and dated. Our food experience was just OK.

We did particularly enjoy the Sunday buffet. Great selection and quality. It was nice to receive the gift each day in the room, but I would rather the Hotel worked on the basics of service before worrying about extra gimmicks.

We went with a Diamond Head room. The view was beautiful. The size of the room is very small for what's being paid.

All in all its not a bad hotel. Just failed to offer us the value and experience I would expect from a Luxury Hotel.","Date of stay: May 2016","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

Fellow Tripadvisors, I cannot state this enough, ignore the good reviews of this hotel!

If you are an American/Canadian/Australian traveler I would highly recommend to not stay here. Go try Trump, Westin, Four Seasons, honestly anything other than this hotel.

The Halekulani is truly the best. Not as secluded as the highly rated Kahala around the corner from Diamond Head but an oasis in the middle of the bustle of Honolulu none the less. Just slightly off the main drag, when you're here you're in a world all your own. Top notch property in extremely well kept condition, the hotel and grounds appear to be in almost as new condition. High caliber employees that are more than helpful and very polite and courteous are truly at your beck and call. Three world class restaurants from the highly rated Le Mer, fine dining Orchids to the casual House Without a Key, there's really no need to venture anywhere else for meals. Our room was not in the main building but in the second 17 story tower which is actually almost directly on the beach, the main building being set back to accommodate the pool and surrounding lawn and open lobby. The room, smaller than some but very adequate with full ocean view and a large balcony was well furnished and decorated tastefully. Condition of the furnishings and carpets were very good to excellent, with no visible signs of heavy wear. In our travels we have stayed in some of the best resorts and hotels and the Halekulani is one of them. Can't end this review without a note to be sure to visit Lewers Lounge in the evenings near the Orchids Restuarant featuring some of best jazz and standards in Hawaii. Vocalist Maggie Herron, a true mistress of song who's played with best, will surely please even the most sophisticated musical palate.

My wife and I recently spent two nights in Waikiki at the Halekulani.  While we have never stayed there before but had gone many times for dinner and drinks and to watch the fantastic Hawaiian show on the beach.  This time we decided to stay in Waikiki and chose the Halekulani.  What a fantastic experience!

We were greeted by Naomi when we checked in and she was so pleasant and nice, I felt like I was being welcomed by my ""auntie""!  From that moment on our stay was so pleasant and relaxed we knew that the Halekulani was a special place.  Our room had a fantastic ocean view and well appointed and spacious.  A special thank you Halekulani for the bottle of sparkling wine to celebrate my birthday.  A nice touch and much appreciated.

Waikiki can be very noisy and hectic, so it was a pleasure to come back to the tranquility of the Halekulani and feel like you are away from all the commotion of Waikiki.

All the staff, especially the pool people and housekeeping, made our stay really enjoyable.  Chris at the pool did a great job of taking care of us and making sure our needs were met.  On check out, Naomi was there to help get us on our way to the airport and off to our next stop, Lanai.  

Also enjoyed the beach access and swimming in the ocean in front of the hotel.  Not a lot of beach but enough to put down our towels and enjoy the sandy beach and swim.

The Halekulani provides a great breakfast with fantastic selection of local fruit and all the other things one could want for breakfast.  I especially liked the Asian breakfast selection which had a very good miso soup.

We also had a great dinner at Orchids one night.  Very fresh fish and a fantastic ocean front table.

Glad to see the Kiawe tree is surviving and being well taken care of!!!

If we were to stay in Waikiki again, it would be at the Halekulani.","Date of stay: October 2016","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Employees are always happy and helpful and better than that, conscientious!  They actually care about each and every guest, individually.  I have been treated with so much respect at the Halekulani that even I thought I was royalty!! 

The rooms are gorgeous and though they can seem small, they are expertly decorated with mirrors and light, soothing colors which makes them seem larger.  And, every room has a balcony that room service is happy to set up for you (with a table cloth) so you can eat your meals outside.

On our recent visit last week our views of this hotel being overrated, more than expensive and service extremely poor were simply confirmed and we will not be staying at this establishment again. Everyone we speak to who travel extensively say for them its the best of a bad lot of Waikiki hotels but am sure if we try hard enough we will find one that appreciates our patronage and delivers far superior service and accommodation. One positive was that when we arrived late morning 2 of our 3 rooms (we travelled with family) were ready. The newspaper delivered to my room was a Japanese paper and since we are Australian was useless for me. I called down at 5pm explaining we required an English print newspaper and were promised it immediately. An hour later still no paper so called again - many apologies - and that we would have the paper sent straight away. Needless to say it wasn't delivered at all that evening and after calling again at 11pm was told the matter would be reported to the manager! All over a simple newspaper?? Next morning at the buffet breakfast which was part of our package my wife asked for a second coffee and the response was ""since your husband didn't have a coffee you can have the second without charge"". The following morning I made the mistake of ordering coffee so when my wife requested a second we were told we would have to pay extra for it even though we had breakfast included in our rate. I said to the waitress/manager that my wife would like the second coffee irrespectively however felt it an absolute disgrace that I was paying approx. us$1800/night for the family and they were going to charge us for a second coffee. The response was ""some people have 4 coffees so we have to put a stop to it somewhere""!!! What a joke when charges at the hotel are so extremely high in the first place.! The Halekulani has seen the very last of my family and would suggest that anyone reading this review should stay elsewhere where they wont feel rorted by a hotel that tries to grab every penny from their guests.

And based on room rates, I expected to find the hotel quite a bit more than what we experienced.  I'll admit coming directly from six nights at the Four Seasons Maui, it was a hard act to follow.  But from the moment we arrived, we felt like not much more than a ""number"" ... and as others have pointed out, the hotel caters mostly to Asians.  Our room was not ready upon arrival, so they offered us a coupon for a ""free soft drink"" at the pool restaurant.  Our $700/night room was small, with a fairly nice bathroom, but the balcony faces many others (no privacy whatsoever), and for the price, I personally think the room should come with an iron/ironing board and in-room coffee service.  The TV remote was infuriatingly difficult to work -- and we wouldn't normally care in a place like Hawaii, but wanted to watch the presidential debates, news and some sports.  Pool is really crowded and service is not up to par.  Beach is about the size of a pool table, and is not private for hotel guests.  The best part of the hotel is that it does have two terrific restaurants -- Orchids and Le Mer, both of which we thoroughly enjoyed.  Amazing views, fabulous food, exceptional service.  Even if you don't stay at the hotel, I HIGHLY recommend the two restaurants.  During our stay, we also saw several managers/owners (in suits) walking the property and apparently checking things out.  That's a good sign.  But overall, this hotel feels a bit like a factory.  We were turned down for a late checkout request, when the hotel definitely did not seem at capacity, and we couldn't possibly have had one of the hotel's nicest rooms.  Our room was on a low level, and although much of the hotel faced diamond head, our ocean view room did not.  (And anyway, who wants to sit on the balcony when it is practically on top of the one on either side of yours?)  I can't say whether other hotels in the area would be better, or not, and a big part of my disappointment is with Honolulu in general.  It is an overcrowded, overrated city, and were it not for our visit to Pearl Harbor, we would have skipped it.  I will say, the hotel has a good location with easy access to shopping, restaurants, and perhaps nightlife.  On a final note, our concierge, Daryce, was terrific.  While I missed her in person each time I stopped by, she booked our tour and restaurants even prior to our trip, and she was very helpful and very kind.

It was neither a good value nor a quality luxury experience. Room rates go for anywhere from several hundred dollars to a couple thousand, depending on the day or the room. At that price expectations should be high, but I've had more impressive experiences at a Holiday Inn Express. At the time of booking the Halekulani was rated #3 hotel in Honolulu by Trip Advisor. At this rate, it will be lucky to be top 5 by the end of the year, or even top 10 by the end of 2017. Luckily, I was here traveling on business. That gives me comfort because 1) I didn't have to shell out my hard earned cash to stay there, and 2) I can give you an unbiased review because I don't have to try to convince myself it was worth it. Let's start with the basics. The customer service was sub-par in almost every way. My wife and I walked past the staff at the front desk and valet several times during our four night stay and they nearly always ignored us. No smiling faces, certainly no ""Aloha."" They would almost take steps to avoid eye contact. Don't get me started on the yahoos at the pool. Had to flag them down to get service. When we left to go up to the room for 15 minutes to pick up a few things we told the pool attendant we would be right back and asked them to save our seats. On two separate occasions we came back to find that not only did they not save the seat, they had removed our towels to set up another couple in the same spot! When we asked for water they grudgingly brought us water bottles, then told us water was available in an igloo style cooler on the opposite end of the pool we could get whenever we want. A cooler!? What is this, a tailgate party?? Fruit infused water was available in a dispenser near the pool, but it was always nearly empty, causing me to have to tip the whole container to get anything out. I'll grant you the food at the pool was pretty good, but I have to warn you I ordered an iced tea that was maybe 6 ounces after ice (see picture) and it cost SIX BUCKS!!! And get this, I asked for a refill, refills are NOT FREE!! Tasted like Lipton, I swear. Even worse I purchased a take out dinner from Steak Shack next door (highly recommend, that will be a separate review, $7.50 for the best chicken on the island, rice, and a salad; or about 1.25 Halekulani iced teas if you're keeping track). I was discretely eating it at the pool and not one but two staff members gave me grief for bringing food in. Maybe it's not a tailgate party after all. Ok, so enough with the service, let's move to the accommodations. Worn carpet starting to fade and pill, stains in the furniture, moldy grout in the shower, and 1970s era James Bond technology by the bed that ""ooooo,"" let's you push a button to turn on and off the lights - EXCEPT the lights at the bottom of the nightstand that we could NEVER figure out how to turn off. (Pictures of all this are attached). We had to literally pile pillows over the lights so we could get some sleep. It all feels so dated. If you can't do it right, don't do it at all. For those of you writing positive reviews that I don't fully comprehend, I challenge you to stay at a Four Seasons for the same or less money and tell me afterward if you still think the Halekulani is on par. I gave the Halekulani two stars, because hey, it's not like it had bed bugs or anything. Could you stay in worse places in Honolulu? Absolutely. And the bar, Lewers Lounge, is a classic. But there are two kinds of people looking for hotels in Honolulu: 1) those who want a pretty good room for a pretty good value and 2) those willing to spend more for a world-class experience. The Halekulani misses on both.","Date of stay: September 2016","Trip type: Traveled on business","ui_bubble_rating bubble_20"

My husband and I were both celebrating landmark birthdays this year and decided to splash out and book Diamond Head rooms for our family.  We hao a fantastic time and loved our stay here.  We arrived very late after travelling from London and check in was welcoming and efficient. I love that you are taken to your room to finish the process.  the rooms were beautiful  and the view was amazing. We were happy to sit on our lanai having breakfast or drinks from ABC.  Housekeeping is excellent, with water and ice replaced regularly and the evening turn down service left a small gift on the bed, and tidied the room again. 

Pool service was good although it was sometimes a little difficult to get an umbrella in the middle of the day. This time we went to the beach more and it was great to be able to pick up beach towels in the pool area for that purpose.

We ate twice at house Without a Key - t's a lovey setting especially in the evening when there is live traditional music but it's not particularly to our taste. The cocktails are good and the Mai Tais are the best - better than the Royal Hawaiian !

The manager's reception is always nice although one was marred by very pushy guests pushing in and monopolising the food service but that wasn't the hotel's fault.

The location is great as you are right in the middle of Waikiki   but in a quiet and relaxing environment. When we passed through other main hotels they felt very busy and impersonal. 

It is a very expensive hotel and way above what we would  normally pay but it's a wonderful place for a special occasion.  The Diamond Head rooms are lovely but we also enjoyed our Garden View rooms last visit.  We would love to come back again sometime.","Date of stay: August 2016","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

If i was a couple trying to celebrate a wedding or anniversary i would look elsewhere.  I do not write negative reviews so this is a first. Rooms are well appointed with a nice welcome amenity. But sevice is what separates the stars a hotel gets. The service has been less than 5 star. Checkin is like at a Vegas Hotel and our room was not ready until after their guaranteed check in time. They have a cramped lounge for guests to change or wait until room is available. We were awakened by loud noises at 5 am which continued for several hours. We thought we were in a motel 6.  As we left our room we saw workman in the room with paint. When i approached the front desk the response was I am sorry. The only solution they offered was to change rooms to a lower floor. But more importantly it was the lack of concern for our comfort that concerned me. Just a very insincere apology. Being full is no excuse for their lack of attention.

I'd wanted to stay here ever since my first vacation here in the very early 1990's.  It doesn't take too many evening sunsets watching Kanoe Miller or her successor Miss Hawaii's elegantly perform hula at House Without a Key to want your own key to a room here, so you can both wake up and retire at this house befitting heaven.  Finally, August 2016 I made the reservation.  
While a hotel on site dates from early last century, the current construction and renovations date from the 1980's.  The several wings of the hotel front Waikiki, and the wing adjacent to Orchids and La Mer provide lucky ocean front guests a picture perfect view of Diamond Head.  It is meant as no slight to say the rooms are rather small and that the bathrooms would be enhanced by updating; somehow, the hotel uses these circumstances to its advantage, and I doubt a guest will complain.  The common areas, including pool and gardens, are both beautiful and elegant.  
What I found most commendable about this property, and why my trip was memorable, and why I will return, was the service.  Regardless of the staff member's position, my interaction with each member was personable, that is, each employee with whom I interfaced treated me, indeed, as if I was an honored guest in his or her own home.  I can name names but don't want to do that for fear I would leave someone out.  But, from registration to restaurant, from pool to spa, from daily interaction with maids and porters, I found the caring service exceptional, and, in the end, I really felt like I was leaving a friend's home (even though in this instance, the 'friend' was unable to accommodate my request for a late check out). 
So yes, Halekulani is a a beautiful facility, my memory of the hotel will rest on the personal effort made by each staff member to make me feel welcome and at home.","Date of stay: August 2016","Trip type: Traveled with friends","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The Halekulani is perfectly located right on the ocean smack in the middle of the Waikiki strip with its abundance of shops, restaurants, hotels and action. Nevertheless, walking into the hotel is like walking into an oasis of calm, class and refinement. The beautiful open gardens on the property add to the aura of calm and tranquility. The decor of the room was airy and light and the view of the ocean and of Diamondhead was breathtaking. The difference between a good hotel and a great hotel is always about the service and the Halekukani's service definitely puts it in the category of great hotels. The service that we received was exceptional. As sabbath observers with special kosher dietary requirements our needs were a little different but the team at the Halekulani starting with Ed Hope (in-room dining) to the waitresses and Maitre D' at House without a Key to the front desk staff, everyone was so attentive to our needs. It was as if everyone was briefed beforehand and waiting to help us.
The visit to Waikiki was unforgettable and The Halekulani made it that way.

I was initially a little skeptical about the price as our Ocean-View room was about the same we had paid previously for a Concierge-level room at the Ritz (in Dallas) but I can honestly say that we got every bit of our money's worth by staying at the Halekulani.  The rooms are somewhat compact (for a Texas girl) but elegant and very well appointed, the service is exceptional, and the view is gorgeous.  Even though Waikiki Beach is crowded and very built-up, the Halekulani is an oasis amid the hustle and bustle.  There were a few families staying at this resort during our vacation but most appeared to be attending one of the numerous weddings we saw during our week's stay.

Special requests at breakfast were handled professionally and were immediately brought to the table every subsequent morning without having to ask again. The beach is very small but at least there is one! The pool is not too big but nice and kept clean. There are not that many umbrellas and people tend to reserve shady seats early so maybe beware of that.

It is an excellent hotel but we were disappointed with:- 
1) dress code. We just spent $670 excl tip in their premium restaurant called La Mer. Dress code was glam for women and long pants long sleeve shirt and closed shoes for men. We dressed up but heaps of visitors did not. Men there in short sleeve polos, women with thongs on their feet. Most of the poorly dressed were Japanese and that was surprising as they are generally very polite and considerate. 
2) experienced the same dress code in Lewers Lounge downstairs. Hotel needs to enforce their dress code by declining admission / offering loan clothes Etc or otherwise they will see the standard decline.
3) in Lewers Lounge asked for an old fashioned and my wife asked for a glass of water. We were told it was a ""one drink minimum"" so she must order something, even if just mineral water. I felt pretty annoyed since we'd just dropped $800 incl tip upstairs. 
4) hotel has nice pool but if you're coming to Honolulu for the beach then this hotel is not the best choice. The Royal Hawaiian hotel a few doors away faces straight onto Waikiki beach and is a far better beach access.","Date of stay: August 2016","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

At $750 per night what we got was a room with two twin beds. The mattresses were awful.

Rooms are ok but to be honest quite worn out. Breakfast was included in the rate but for that you get a coupon/kind of card you need to get stamped every morning which feels a bit back to the eighties.

Such a shame.

I've never queued/waited in line for a breakfast table at any hotel, ever, in over 35 years of travelling, let alone in this price bracket, let alone for 30 minutes ( House Without A Key. ) Felt a bit sorry for the serving staff who seemed to be making the best of a bad situation.

We also waited in line to get a pre dinner drink on the Hotel's only outdoor cafe / bar terrace, but ran out of patience and walked off.  ( House Without A Key )

At lunch my child got completely the wrong meal and part of mine didn't arrive at all. ( House Without A Key )

We went to Orchids on a couple of occasions, which offers more gastro/complex dishes than House Without A Key. First time fine, although food ok'ish at best for the money. 

Second time just felt like basic standards about serving dinner had been forgotten; for example,I've never before had the server standing by my side with my main course as I was still eating my first course/appetiser, as I did here ( at least he offered to keep it warm.) Wine list appeared half way through the the meal. Woeful.

To be balanced, there are good things; we stayed in an ocean front Diamond Head view room which, whilst compact, was perfect in every way and a worthy mention for housekeeping who looked after the room so well. Immaculate hotel when it comes to lobby, courtyards, grounds etc. Good pool service with great features like complimentary water, no sun bed charge etc. Good Spa and my wife highly rated the Lomi Lomi massage.

And most importantly Kanoe Miller whose iconic perfomance here ( on the outside terrace of House Without A Key at least ) is something every traveller should enjoy along with their favourite cocktail, or drink, at least once.

For first timers, usual Waikiki warnings apply; neighbouring hotels are very close, don't assume what beach space hotels have ( mostly no beach/ concrete sea wall here) and it will be cosy round the modest ( but elegant, in this case) pool.

I recently (late 2014) returned to the Halekulani for a second and third stay following the first fantastic experience there.  

This time I decided to try an Ocean View room as we were staying longer and the cost was therefore higher (previously I stayed in an Ocean Front room).  Again I booked through Luxury Hotel Experts (related to Virtuoso Travel I believe) which resulted in a guaranteed upgrade (this time from Partial Ocean View to Ocean View) and full American Breakfast at Orchids or the Breakfast Buffet at House Without a Key.  On Sundays there is a famous brunch at Orchids so on Sundays you can’t use the breakfast option at Orchids.  More on that later.

One of the many things about the Halekulani is they really do listen to their guests and try and make the experience as wonderful as possible.  I asked again for a high floor and when we arrived at our room I was thrilled with where they had situated us.  We were as expected in an Ocean View room however our room (room 1258) was very close to where the Diamond Head Ocean Front Rooms begin (the other side of the elevators – you can get a feel for where the rooms are situated from the Halekulani website) in the Ewa Wing. This wing is quieter than the other buildings as it is set away from the restaurant, pool and if you’re in a Diamond Head Ocean Front or Ocean View room towards the elevators, it is away from the busy street also.  Because we were on a high floor we didn’t have rooms looking directly across at us like most of the Ocean View Rooms (which typically face each other and you see the ocean from an angle in the room or balcony.  We could see most of Diamond Head and the ocean however of course there is the large Sheraton monstrosity that blocks part of the view also.

Our room was as expected – relaxing, calm and in perfect condition.  It had been a couple of years since the ‘renewal’ when new furniture and carpets were added but our room looked like the last time we stayed when it had just been renovated.  The room is reasonably large and includes a couch, coffee table, desk, large set of drawers and very large TV.  There is a table and chairs and a sun lounge on the generous balcony also.  The bathroom is a fairly standard size and comes with many amenities (from the usual through to the not so usual – soap suds anyone?).  The towels and bed linens are lush and after a back of house tour (more on that later) we could appreciate that all the sheets are ironed and replaced daily.  The room is serviced during the day and as many others have indicated, there is a turn down service where a small gift is left each evening with a card that has a different message each day.  The gifts range from shells to key chains to fragrance pouches and postcards.  

As others have said what sets the Halekulani apart is the service, the location, the surrounds and the ‘value adds’ that keep many coming back again and again (I will be returning for another 8 nights later this year!).  The prices are very high for the size of the room and indeed some have commented they felt the rooms weren’t value for money – this is going to depend on the guest.  I love the fact the rooms are tranquil and in their trademark ‘seven shades of white’ stands the test of time and truly lets the view ‘pop’.

Service: Could not rate highly enough.  From the in-room check in (yes the initial queuing at the check in counter is a little disorganized if you arrive at a busy time) where even the most basic amenities are pointed out to you (including gesturing to the mirror!), to the refreshments at the pool, to the concierge, to the wonderful staff at the dining areas, everyone and everything is top notch.

Location:  The location is perfect, not quite a ‘beach’ out the front as others have mentioned but you can access the beach by walking directly out the back gate which is just so convenient after meeting friends for drinks at the other hotels along the beach or swimming directly outside the hotel.  The area for swimming directly outside the hotel is actually pretty fun to swim in, there are decent waves to rock you back and forth and as the tide comes in it does get quite fun watching people get splashed as they walk along the foreshore!  Also many don’t realize that you don’t need to go on a day trip to see the large turtles, they actually surface outside the Halekulani if you have a keen eye, and also pop up outside the Moana Surfrider.  We saw them each day we were there and many others didn’t notice them surfacing right in front of them!  Going away from the beach there is Nobu across the street, Dennys if you feel like you need a post-night out grease fest and the ubiquitous ABC stores are everywhere, with a very large one that includes a deli and large alcohol section a few doors up the street (they have great meals here, sun lounges and anything you could imagine).  We dined at an Italian Restaurant near by that was very good (the second time we’ve dined there) and also took a cab to a Teppanyaki Steak House near The Modern that was just ‘ok’.  There is luxury row about 5 minutes walk where Chanel, Gucci, Hugo Boss, Tiffany is located to the left, and Vuitton, Hermes, Bally and every other high end store you can imagine to the right.  We booked a driver this time to pick us up from the airport but I would not recommend it.  Although he met us at the luggage carousel he did not assist with luggage (apparently according to concierge this is some work place law or something similar) and then as we wheeled our (excessive amount of…!) luggage he went and got the car which took another 5 – 10 minutes as we watched everyone else just grab a cab.  Lesson learned, just get a cab.

Halekulani Surrounds.  The cliché ‘oasis’ is mentioned in pretty much every review of Halekulani and it’s absolutely true.  You would not believe you were staying in the middle of one of the busiest areas (picture New York dropped on a beach location) once you enter the open aired grounds.  There is definitely an ‘80s vibe to the architecture but it’s beautifully maintained and has a touch of ‘retro elegance’ to it.  You enter through a porte cochere where the excellent staff whisk your bags away or assist you with a taxi to any location.  The staff are so friendly they even remember you much later in the day (how was your shopping excursion was heard more than once!).  You then enter the main lobby where initial check-in is handled – a word of warning – use a separate credit card for checkin as the hotel take a large security hold over your card for the value of your stay which doesn’t drop off until later.  I always use a separate card to check in here as the average stay is upwards of AUD$5,000 and that on top of the check out charge can push your credit card balance way north if you’re not expecting it.  The other option would be to pay upon arrival and perhaps they would not need to put such a significant security hold on your card.  You are then either whisked up to your room for the full check in, or offered to use the Hospitality Suite.  We arrived early as most Australian flights do and our room was not ready.  We were escorted to the Hospitality Suite which looked quite busy when we arrived, there were many people on the couches – not sure why you would be in there when you could be by the pool or relaxing at House Without a Key.  Regardless there are a number of lockers and showers so we quickly used the showers and changed and headed down to enjoy the pool surrounds.  The pool is not massive but it’s also not teaming with tourists like the other pools are.  I find in Waikiki the pools along the beach are filled with guests and range from large pools packed with Children (the Sheraton) to the most tiny pool you can imagine (Moana Surfrider), or they are up high at hotels away from the beach and only get limited sun because of all the high rise buildings and/or are windtraps for the same reason.  The Halekulani pool is again peaceful and although there are plenty of children, this being a resort that has a very large Japanese clientele, they are always respectful and well behaved rather than noisy spoiled brats (a generalization I know, but it holds true here).  The other facilities that we frequented were the Helekulani Boutique which is a really adorable mix of clothing, gifts, everyday items (magazines, drinks) and Helekulani merchandise.  On our last night I hit the boutique and came out with wine glasses (these are top quality and I use them all the time), chocolates (boxes and boxes, they are SO good – coconut cake, mai tai, salted caramel and rose flavoured), and my favourite the king pillows that are in the rooms are available to purchase and come rolled up and semi flat packed so they easily fit in your luggage.  The staff are unbelievably helpful here and will ship anything (including the chocolates!) except wine to pretty much anywhere in the world.

Food & Beverage:  We were celebrating my 40th birthday so I had organized dinner for 9 people at Orchids, as I did two years earlier via Ku’ulei Upton who is so helpful and everything went off seamlessly.  This time I had the opportunity to meet Ku’ulei the day before the dinner and we went through the most minute detail (seating chart, where the table was located for the best views) even though it was just a small dinner and in the grand scheme of things would be a very small blip on even the most mundane night at Orchids.  She made us feel like honored guests and told us that she’s worked there for 20+ years.  This is what the Halekulani is all about – the staff who have worked there for many years who I imagine would be paid more than most of the other transient staff at many other resorts.  Time and time again we met staff that have worked at the Halekulani for 20+ years and who are there each time we return).  Orchids is a  beautiful location for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  The service is 5 star and the setting has to be seen to be believed.  There is an evening dress code in the evening (no shorts, no torn jeans, collared shirt/polo) but it is still relaxed and definitely not stuffy at all.  I loved breakfast each day there and the staff were wonderfully efficient.  House Without A Key is one of my favourite places to go for lunch (yes, there are options everywhere for lunch but why leave the resort – I was constantly amazed that lunch is very quiet there, most people are shopping, by the pool or out doing day trips).  Teri who has worked there for many years looked after us a number of times, as did Casey for drinks in the evening or by the pool, and particularly wonderful was Ian, who was attentive and ‘chatty’ when you were up to it but left you alone if you wanted to relax and enjoy the meal.  We stayed for a week and then went to Kauai for a week, and returned to the Halekulani for the last night in Hawaii.  Ian immediately remembered us, asked us how our trip was to Kauai and as we settled the cheque for dinner, he came out with a piece of Coconut Cake to take to our room as he remembered how we had discussed how good it was at dinner at Orchids on our last stay.  That is the service that you can expect here.  We did not dine at La Mer but we did get to see it when we went on the Back of House Tour (Friday mornings) with Mabel, who has worked for something like 30 or 40+ years at the Halekulani.  It is spectacular by day and can only imagine it at night, but we just never felt like something that formal and/or a degustation when we were so relaxed in the evening.  The room service menu is pretty limited (it reflects most of the menu at House Without A Key) but boy do they make up for it when it arrives.  White tablecloths, a beautiful floral table setting, luxury silverware and beautiful food presentation (including ice water).  We stole the table setting each time and added them to the room (!) so we ended up in a room surrounded by beautiful floral settings.  For my 40th my partner also organized  a beautiful floral arrangement from their onsite ikebana florist.  I mentioned the Back of House tour – this is a bit of a quirky thing to do and I would probably only recommend it for people that are really fans of the hotel (such as myself).  You get a tour of some really interesting functions (the catering area where you get to sample some treats, the linen area where you see the massive ‘iron and fold’ sheet machines that have to be seen to be believed) to some fairly random but fun functions such as the print room where they discuss in minute detail the font colour and paper stock (!).  Mabel closes off the tour with a glass of iced tea at HWAK. We jokingly asked if we could have a Haletai instead (the Halekulani variation of a maitai – so, so good) and before we could sit down a round of Haletais was brought out to the table.

So, as you can probably guess, this hotel is my favourite place on earth.  It’s not as ‘wow’ as some hotels I’ve stayed at, the rooms are not as lush, large or luxurious, the pool not as spectacular, the view close to, but not the best I’ve experienced, but this hotel is one where all the sum of its parts leads to an other worldly experience – great location, great surrounds and wonderful staff.  Truly befitting its name as the ‘House Befitting Heaven’.  

I look forward to returning later this year.  If you were to ask me to pick between Ocean Front and Ocean View, Ocean Front is probably the safer bet.  Upon reflection this time I've booked to stay 5 nights in an Ocean Front room and then the remaining 3 nights at an Ocean View Room to mix things up a bit.  Again I booked through a Virtuoso Travel Agent and got a guaranteed upgrade on both rooms (Ocean View upgrade to Ocean Front, Partial Ocean View upgrade to Ocean View) and breakfast and a $100 resort credit.  This is definitely good value and was the only way to get a guaranteed upgrade and breakfast included in the rate (even when booking directly).","Date of stay: September 2015","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

For the 800US a night (including the extravagant tax) I was expecting something extraordinary! However, after spending 5 nights here it is clear that you are paying for a lot more than location and the suite. The services they provide are brilliant, the turn down service provided a very special gift every night which I felt was a great touch. Yes there were cons, for instance the buffet breakfast was always very busy and we had to wait sometimes up to 25 minutes for a table, and there is no private beach and a small pool. However because of this there are not many children around and it is the perfect place for couples to retreat. After travelling through Hawaii it is difficult to find a kid free noise free hotel, but this is it! Great customer service and you definitely feel a part of a 5 star experience... maybe not worth the 800 a night, but for location and convenience and star rating it comes close.","Date of stay: July 2016","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

But none offer such a dramatic difference in the experience of luxury than the Halekulani Suites with a view of Waikiki beach and Diamond Head crater backdrop. 

From the welcoming to the last moment. It is worth noting that there is a pronounced difference in the welcoming procedures, wether by design or otherwise, this experience was much better than our previous check-ins. To note that it already was excellent.

In Room check in with welcome chocolates and fruit. (Larger box)
Tour of room amenities and functionality. More time spent in welcoming.
Fresh flowers all over.
Dining reservations offered.
Opening of the Lanais to a dramatic view of Diamond Head, spectacular.

More abundant and additional amenities in the bathroom, like Bath Salts, Coola mineral sunscreen, water, etc.
The advantage of two lanais one with dining furniture and the other with sun beds with a stunning view.
Pool service is good if you order as soon as you settle in your sun beds, that way the waiter will keep you on their radar. Otherwise it is quite hands off which could be what you want.
House without a Key Dining, well the certainty that the experienced staff will care for you as best as possible is already a huge bonus. And then there is the superb tasting food and ambiance. There is nothing like it in Waikiki. 
Orchids Dining, if you feel like white table cloth and a more quiet setting with out big formalities, this is just right. Plates can be lean, but dessert is worth the space. Resort dress code.
La Mer, formal, romantic, to be savored slowly. The tasting menu can encompass some time but it is excellent.
The Spa, while no wet spa is available here, the treatments are top notch. I just wish they had pools, tubs, fountains, I can only dream, the Spa at Halekulani is more about treatments.
Evening drinks and pupu appetizers at the House without a Key with live Hawaiian music and hula dancers is sure to bring home that you are in paradise. 
Then retire to your suite and enjoy the night view which is serene. 
The bath products have nice packaging but are not necessarily great. They are not made in Hawaii, NY, Paris nor Tokyo for that matter. Not too bad but I wish they improved in quality and scent. Lilikoi? White tea?
I also wish the checkout process was as calm as the check in. There must be a way.
Bottom line, I highly recommend investing on the view, you have made it this far.

The words were there and so were the gestures (a nice treat each night at turndown), but it did not feel sincere/warm.  It felt a little bit stuck up and I generally found the staff quite cold.

On the positive side, the pool is just fabulous, probably the best on the strip, great location, great views.  Pool guys were a bit stony faced and unfriendly (also don't make noise in the pool, bring floaties, or have too much fun, so not great for boisterous kids) and service was slow.  But food by the pool was very good quality.

House without a key - excellent quality breakfast buffet and here the staff were great.  Restaurant manager Pamela is on the ball and runs it well.

Rooms nice but a little dated, very small bath/shower, but huge balconies.  Great views.","Date of stay: July 2016","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

We finally left after 5 nights to spend our last 3 at a more vibrant hotel. Biggest issue is the lack of beach access. This was not evident in the description of the ""beachfront"" hotel. We spent much energy every day leaving our expensive hotel to go down the beach and pay to rent beach chairs at the other hotels mentioned above. The clientele at the Halekulani is quite low key and conservative. There is even a dress code. The food was overpriced. The entertainment options were limited.

We had booked 3 ocean view rooms for our family of 6, and the views were lovely and the rooms a good size.
The hotel was a great calm and relaxed feel and it was a joy to sit around the pool, or have drinks in the evening by the beach. We were invited to the manager's drinks one evening, which was a special and generous touch. A breakfast at Orchids was a highlight.
I agree with previous comments about insufficient pool umbrellas.

The property, the location, the rooms are all 5 starts.  The service is first class also.  Service here is a real attribute that sets this place apart.  

I would certainly start here again.  

However - Some drawbacks to note:

@ pool - very nice in terms of size temperature and service.  Yet they need a better way to sort out the pool chairs.  you need to be a very early riser to get a good spot otherwise what's left is at a back rows and in the sun.  The obvious issue is not enough It is sun umbrellas.  There about 59 umbrellas and twice if not more chairs. This pool sitting issues is the reason why I think this hotel is not 5 stars.  
@breakfast - the buffet is surely not 5 stars in terms of food quality and variety and the whole setting.  The other restaurant is however fantastic for breakfast.  
@beach - not part of hotel so no sitting arrangements by hotel.","Date of stay: July 2016","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

The service at both hotels is first rate, as one would expect of 5 star properties (and prices to match).

We really enjoyed the Halekulani and will be staying here again.  The pool is better (it's ground level and the hotel does have a small beach).  The Trump's pool is on a higher floor, it is unique in that you can swim to the edge, but it's very small, and the Trump has no beach as it is one block away from the public beach.

The Halekulani has a wonderful casual restaurant that faces the beach whereas the Trump's restaurant is on the second level on a terrace and the view is actually blocked by the Halekulani.

Sorry for the comparisons, but I think most people who are considering the Halekulani would also be considering the Trump.

One may consider this a negative, the but Halekulani does a significant wedding business, today for example, there were 2 weddings.  While they do not interfere with the regular areas of the hotel, to some this might be distracting.

Definitely get an ocean view room, the premium rooms view Diamondhead.   The view facing away from the ocean Is not that appealing.

Last couple of tips:  the hotel is one block from Kalakaua Avenue, the main shopping street and Waikiki beach.  The location is outstanding - while we had a car, we walked everywhere, Ala Moana mall is about a 1 mile walk.  There are food trucks about a block away that offer excellent food at inexpensive prices - not to offend the big chains, but you can get much better food for less than going to the Hard Rock Cafe, PF Chang's, or the Yard House, which are a block from the hotel.","Date of stay: July 2016","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Now I will forewarn you, if you are looking for beget friendly, or a place with lots of activities for little kids, this is not your place to go. I had 2 connecting Diamond Head Suites, and they were absolutely wonderful. We had room service breakfast almost every morning, which was delicious, and went to brunch at Orchids twice. If you are staying on a Sunday, you have to try the brunch, they say it's the best on the island, and I believe it!

We ate at La Mer (delicious, but very pricey), and House without a Key, we never had a bad meal during our entire stay. We ate meals at other places also in Waikiki, and can say in comparison, the food here was first class. I did the spa twice, and highly recommend it. I went to the pool every day, never had an issue getting a lounge chair, bar service was also great! The downsides are that it is very expensive, so expect to pay top dollar, and there is no beach right in front of the hotel to go to. However, a short walk to the left or right of the hotel will get you beach access that is beautiful. The beaches are super crowded, so I only spent one day there, I opted for the pool instead. 
All the services here were first class, from maid service, to room service, concierge and check in/out. Rest assured, if you go to Halekulani, you won't be disappointed!","Date of stay: July 2016","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

My wife is a dedicated foodie and shopper, & I have post graduate qualifications in kicking back and soaking in the relaxation great Hotels like the Halekulani deliver. We had been told by good friends this property was perfect for our needs and it was.
The location, room (we elected partial ocean view, which really couldn't have been more perfect with a great view over the pool and out to sea), and all onsite facilities were excellent. 
Staff we encountered were all efficient, polite and attentive.. We ate in Orchids, La Mer and House Without a Key.. all were very pleasing, but the standout was having Nobu directly across the road opposite the Hotel..which saw us there on three consecutive nights..EXCEPTIONAL.
The room was spacious with a decent balcony & well appointed throughout, though the lack of an actual toilet door (by design) between the walk in wardrobe & bathroom was interesting.
One thing that was noticeable on two nights of our stay was how sound/noise from 'balcony revellers' on other levels and locations was very audible. On the upside was that a call to the front desk complaining & giving approximate location of the partygoers, almost immediately resulted in action leading to the cessation of further interuption. 
All in all.. we couldn't have been happier. The location providing a waterfront path to Waikiki and beyond (we walked to Diamond Head), and ever present cabs for the Necessary shopping excursion to the Ala Moana Center couldn't have been more convenient.

Other nights we sat and had drinks at House Without A Key, their main restaurant which has nightly singers and dancers on the grass. Really, a most memorable week and a perfect romantic getaway. One last thing, whilst it was perfect for that occasion, it is not somewhere I would bring my young children. There are many other hotels that cater for children such as the Sheraton or Hilton with the fabulous kids pools etc.","Date of stay: June 2015","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

In this way, it is definitely more ""formal"" than the other hotels in the area and much more sedate by the pool.

At first I didn't understand all the hype surrounding this hotel... such as ""it's the best hotel in Waikiki"", yet after venturing out onto the beach via the back gate of the hotel, I definitely came to see why it's so special. It just doesn't have the loud drinking travellers or the hundreds of Australians acting like drunken tourists. It was calm and very civilised.

So if we went down the beach for a swim, walk or surf, we LOVED returning to the calm ground of the hotel and staying by the pool.

The pool was never crowded (we were there for just 5 days), yet it never felt too busy or too loud.

The food was pretty good at the hotel and the buffet breakfast was lovely. 

Although it was all quite lovely, there was definitely a sense of detachment from the staff (unlike where we'd stayed the week before!)

We would definitely go back again if we travel without the kids again.","Date of stay: May 2016","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

This hotel left me feeling ripped off. I booked online with a rate that included a free upgrade and was given the upgrade but it was a wheelchair accessible room. We weren't warned of that during checkin but when I brought it up to the concierge, supposedly they were totally booked until 3 days into our stay. By the forth day, we switched rooms and the rooms were worlds apart in character especially in the bathroom and bedding. I would have preferred them to have given me an option to upgrade or not. It felt as if they were being dishonest. You spend so much money here, that you expect service to be spectacular. There was a certain female waiter during the breakfast buffet that we, unfortunately, were waited on by twice and she was the slowest in getting drinks or anything that we asked for. One time, I eventually just got up and asked the bar for my own drink. The pool service was ok, pretty slow as well. The food we received during breakfast, poolside, and in-room was really nothing to brag about. We never finished our food. Location is close to everything, shopping, restaurants, etc. You can walk down to Waikiki Beach but be prepared to have no seats or shade like some of the other resorts have since they are right in the beach. Really wish Four Seasons was open when we visited Oahu. Would have definitely stayed there instead and will during our next visit.","Date of stay: February 2016","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

Service was exceptional. Shout outs to Chris in the pool area and Nathan in valet for the quality service.

Currently, the Kahala and the Halekulani are the best luxury hotel options on the island (Four Seasons Ko’Olina slated to open in mid 2016) I prefer the Halekulani over the Kahala due to the location, but if you prefer to spend time at the beach, Kahala may be better for you. The beach is very shallow in this part of Oahu, and you will be spending time at the pool. This was my 3rd time staying at the hotel in the past 10 years, and the service is consistently excellent! Everyone from the concierge to the valet, and pool attendants are extremely helpful, attentive and friendly. The hotel hasn’t been updated since I last stayed and the fixtures in rooms are not as updated as other luxury resorts I have recently stayed. House without a Key is the best place to enjoy the sunset and mai tais. If you have always wanted to try surfing, I highly recommend the Ty Gurney Surf School, which takes you surfing right in front of the Halekulani (and you can charge it to your room) We had Ty for our private lesson and he was fantastic.

Of the several hotels along this stretch of oceanfront (immediately adjacent to Waikiki Beach), it it is by far the nicest hotel in terms of landscaping, upkeep, and overall beauty. 

The service here is excellent. The pool personnel were fantastic as well as the pool waitstaff (thanks Chris, Casey, Adam, Alfredo, you guys were marvelous). Front desk, concierge, and valet personnel were fantastic with one caveat, one lady at the front desk flat out refused to let us have a late check-out, stating we needed to inform them at time of check-in. What? This has never been the case in any of the hotels I have ever stayed at around the world. Sometimes your plans change mid-stay necessitating a late check-out. Besides, we asked when we made the hotel reservations and were told to we could wait until the end of our stay to ask. All was rectified when we came back later and talked to another lady at the front desk who gave us a late check-out without question.

The restaurant, bar, breakfast buffets and nighttime live entertainment were all wonderful.  

On the downside, Wifi was very spotty in the room. If we moved more than a few feet from the desk, our Wifi dropped off significantly. Poolside Wifi was terrific. 

One last note to the Halekulani, enforce your pool chair policy. As typical for resorts, people will claim the best poolside chairs practically before sunrise. I've seen prime poolside seats go unoccupied until 1 or 2 in the afternoon. Apparently, these people went shopping and had lunch before returning to claim their premier lounges. Not cool, not fair. If you have a two hour policy, you should enforce it.","Date of stay: April 2016","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

At over $800 per night my expectation were already quite high...

After being setup in our pool lounge chairs we waited over an hour for service, which never came.  I was forced to request service directly from a waiter that was serving another guest.   I requested the manager get involved and he quickly had our food and drinks served.  After clearing the remaining items, we returned to a period of over an hour with no service.  The situation again required that I go directly to the wait staff and request service.  We waited another 30 mins, an the waiter that promised to be right over never returned.  At this s point we were so frustrated that we gave up.  We arrived at 12 pm, by 4 pm we had received two visits to our lounge chairs, two sets of drinks!  They charged us nothing for the drinks and sandwiches.

The hotel beach area was a major disappointment.  It is a man made chute, maybe 50' wide.  It's not a beach.

Overall the hotel service was less than adequate for a five star hotel.  The condition of the hotel was typical for Honolulu hotels...dated, carpet worn, in need of an update.  For less than half the price, other very good hotels are available in Waikiki.  Clearly the convention business has been too good to this hotel.   Keep looking and take a close look at the beach area before booking.

We're pretty well versed travelers...discerning without being pretentious.  We also happen to own a Bed & Breakfast as well as a hotel, so we know a little something about the hospitality business.  All of that gives some support to saying that this is finest hotel in the World.

The physical property is unmatched, with its perfectly maintained pool, beautiful gardens and ideal location right on the beach with Diamond Head as a beautiful backdrop.  

And the staff are simply the best.  They're friendly, warm, professional, knowledgable and helpful...even if what is being asked of them ""isn't their job"", they'll attempt to help or, if they can't, they will personally escort you to someone who can.  Check in is lovely, done in the privacy of your room, which allows for great one-on-one experience and comfort asking questions that you feel stupid asking in public (like ""how does this shower work?"")

But it's the details that really sets this place apart.  NOTHING, literally nothing, has been overlooked.  Hanging out at the pool?  The pool attendant will put the towel cover down on your lounge chair and make sure the bar waiter is immediately sent over to you.  Hot while you're at the pool...no problem, they walk around with cold towel and cold treats (like popsicles, frozen bananas, etc) throughout the day.  Forget something at home...no issue, the bathrooms have every single amenity that you could possibly want.  Bottled water is supplied comp in the refrigerator, the closet doors open on both sides so that you can view Diamond Head from the bath.  The floor to ceiling windows, providing unbelievable views are tinted so you don't have to worry about someone looking up/into your room.

There was a huge balcony at the end of the corridor that had views of the beach, sea, up and down and all around.

This is not a 'resort' hotel - no big beach-front.  This end of the beach is pretty small - I think there is a walkway, plus big concrete wall to stop the beach from getting washed away (from memory).

There was some Hula dancing - I think it was Saturday or Friday early evening at sunset.  It was fun - but not Pacific Islander big dancing.  Just one lady and some Ukele singers.

Close to Waikiki Beach and Madison Avenue like shopping, it's understandable why it's so popular amongst folks looking for sun and bargains.    The rooms were comfortable, albeit the bathrooms were small - showers were tight in size.  The staff was very accommodating and helpful and were trained to please.

The breakfast buffet at the House With a View Restaurant is located just off the pool and offers a wide variety of both classic American offerings, as well as Asian breakfast fare - miso broth with fixings etc.  Be prepared to wait for a table from 830am on...

The pool area itself, while lovely looking in pictures, is relatively small for this size property - obtaining lounge chairs is a competitive exercise so if you want one, get up before the sun!   We were there during spring break and the pool was filled with tots and parents so be prepared for splashing and activity.  It's not conducive to an ""adult"" like experience.

As for the beach - it's the size of a postage stamp - enough said.

The hotel is a city hotel - it's not a resort experience if that's what you're looking for.","Date of stay: March 2016","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

It’s not at the same level as the George Cinq in Paris, or the Auberge Carmel in California, or the Monestario in Quito, all of which are true five star hotels. The Halekulani is a large beach hotel, with a great location and good views (if you upgrade to an ocean view room).  It has been around for some years but has been updated enough that it wasn’t noticeable.  Electrical connections were handy at bed side as were lighting controls.  I was leaning to four stars when one of the concierges, Dee Dee, helped us plan an all day road trip.  I couldn’t decipher the tourist map that came with the rental car nor could I really put a good trip plan together using one of the popular travel guide books.  Dee Dee took the tourist map and marked it up for us, talked us through it with highlights and directional landmarks, and it worked perfectly for us, so I raised the rating to five stars for the concierge service.","Date of stay: March 2016","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Every aspect of our stay exceeded our expectations, including room comfort, poolside, restaurants, facilities and personnel. Some items of note: if you want to swim in the ocean, leave the pool area and walk 5 minutes toward Diamondhead. The beach is more enjoyable there. The heated pool at the hotel is beautiful and the service is good without being intrusive. Let yourself indulge in the coconut cake, multiple times. I'm from the South, the land of coconut cake, and the Halekulani's is better than my mama's. Allow the hotel to arrange a private tour of Pearl Harbor. The company they use, Keawe Adventures, is top-notch. Sunday brunch at Orchids Restaurant is overwhelmingly good (and they serve that coconut cake).

The Halekulani will cost you, but it is well worth it. You won't be disappointed.","Date of stay: March 2016","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We absolutely love this hotel! It is a luxurious and quiet oasis in the middle of busy Waikiki. There are many places to walk to nearby for shopping, which makes it easy because of all of the city traffic. The service standards at this hotel are exceptional. Every staff member that you encounter is warm and helpful. It is an Asian hotel with many Asian guests. 

The common areas and grounds are beautiful and have a lovely sweet smell. I don't know if they pipe it in or if it is from the flowers everywhere. Regardless, it is wonderful. Every time we come here we have seen a wedding taking place every day!

The restaurants are so fantastic that we rarely leave the property to dine. We've had many breakfasts and lunches at House Without a Key and dinners at Orchids. I still dream about their steamed onaga entree and the coconut cake for dessert! We have had dinner at La Mer a couple of times. The service and quality of the food is wonderful, but the French menu doesn't really have too many items that we care for on it. For this reason we don't go there every trip.

We enjoyed the happy hour music and hula at House Without a Key and after dinner enjoyed jazz at Lewers Lounge. 

We always book the Diamond Head View rooms for the spectacular view. The rooms themselves are small, but comfortable. My only issue is there isn't really any space to get unsightly luggage out of view in the room because the closets are sort of small. I need to remind myself that this is a city hotel, and space is of a premium. The turndown service is very fun as they leave small gifts on the pillow each night.","Date of stay: March 2016","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The wow factor is the amazing pool area. The large pool itself is gorgeous. But more important, we have never once arrived when there wasn't a good selection of desirable chaises longues. As far as we can see, all the other upscale resorts in Waikiki have skimpy -- and sometimes pathetic -- pool areas. Even in more remote locations, people complain that they must grab available places at the crack of dawn. You don't go on vacation for that!

The rooms themselves are not huge or lavish, but they are tasteful and comfortable. Except for a few special suites, all the rooms are substantially identical. The only difference is the view. If you are willing to sacrifice a bit on view, you can save a lot of money. On our first stay, we had a Diamond Head view, which was spectacular. The last two times, we saved about $1,000 by staying in ocean view rooms, which were about 90% as wonderful. It helped to ask for a high floor, and the view from our room on all three trips was worth every penny. But even the garden view rooms appear to have pleasant garden views, and could save about $2,000 over a week's vacation. As far as we could determine, there are zero bad rooms in this hotel. 

You can also save by taking the package deal that includes breakfast. We loved the buffet at the House Without a Key, which included a great array of Asian as well as American options.  The Orchids restaurant on the premises is very pleasant. The luxurious La Mer restaurant at the resort is beautiful, though we found it a bit overpriced on our visit two years ago. We found several very good restaurants within walking distance of the resort.  We particularly like Il Lupino, whose outdoor seating is delightful,  and Toarmina, which is just up the street. Two blocks away on Beach Walk. Wasabi Bistro was a hidden gem and a real bargain. 

Service at this hotel was uniformly gracious, friendly and efficient and is one of the great attractions here.Sandra in the House Without a Key was delightful. The one drawback for some people might be the skimpy beach directly in the front of the hotel. But a bigger beach is a short walk away. And with a pool like the Halekulani's, who cares?","Date of stay: March 2016","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

It's an extremely tranquil hotel, despite being in the middle of Waikiki.  (It helps that the hotel limits you to 2 people per room.) The breakfast buffet is superb, not least because the breakfast staff treats you like family. (They remember us from year to year.) The rest of the staff is also friendly and very helpful.  Service is top notch.
The hotel has a beautiful pool but a very small beach. All beaches in Hawaii have public access so it's not that inconvenient to walk a few hundred yards to a larger expanse of beach. 
The hotel isn't opulent by American standards, but it is luxurious and quiet and unobtrusive in its excellent service. Kids are welcome here, but loud and rambunctious is not, so keep that in mind. We've brought our kids since they were 5 and 8 without any problems (they are both teenagers now), and they love it!

We enjoyed our ""ocean front diamond head"" connecting rooms: there was some ""entry"" area in addition to two our rooms  (to keep the stroller at.)

Our stroller was damaged during the flight- the hotel provided us with a great jogging stroller for a duration of our stay at no extra change.

There is no playroom or playground at the resort but lots of fun nearby every night: free live concerts, the zoo, shows, stores, cute cafes.
Hotel staff was helpful to find and organize kids appropriate activities.

I am taking a star away for a few reasons:
We saw many families with kids : would be nice to add a small shaded pool for little guests with sand bottom to play at. The beach nearby is not kids friendly. The pool is too deep for young kids.

The fridges at the rooms were very loud. We couldn't sleep and had to turn it off completely.

The hotel seems very well looked after and as soon you are checking in you will realize, that the real difference here is the staff! 

I have not seen many  places, where you can find so many professional amazingly friendly and helpful people working throughout all the outlets!!!

The breakfast buffet at the restaurant ""house without a key"" offers an outstanding American, Asian breakfast experience and the lounge bar with its life music (jazz) brings you back in a movie of the 30's. 

The orchid restaurant is perfect for enjoying some of the finest see food in town, and the Hawaiian music coming over from the band which plays just across the garden, combined with the sounds of the waves and the lights of the Waikiki beach skyline fulfills your Hawaiian dream.

We stayed in a room with lateral few of the ocean which however gives you the impression of having an oceanfront room, since the hotels towers are built in a U-shape, all towards the beach. Besides, the good size of the room makes you feel like staying in a junior suite. 

The interior is quite contemporary and the white and beige tones make it very homey!

E special highlight and sweet bonus is also, that every night when housekeeping prepares the room, the leave little presents like a seashell or a Halekulani pen together with a thoughtful written note on the pillow, very sweet detail!!

The pool area is very well presented and the pool staff is looking after you with towels, fruits or chocolate bars and servers are always available in case you like to order something from the menu.

This hotel is definitely for people who like to relax and appreciate good service, it's not a party location.

The only less positive thing for myself was, that the beach in front of the hotel is to tiny to stay there, so you need to take a short walk over the promenade to get to the beautiful Waikiki beach!","Date of stay: March 2016","Trip type: Traveled with friends","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Restaurant ""Without a Key"" is great for breakfast but for dinner you'll want to find a key to another restaurant.  We were sadly disappointed to be seated in a strangely isolated table, not well served though it was a special occasion (our anniversary) and menu is really limited.  Of course there are other restaurants on property but we had hoped for a lovely casual dinner with hula show (as we have enjoyed in the past). We had to ask again and again for water and salad dressing...small and petty things that made us feel small and petty on a special night.

The suite is separated from the hotel rooms, and 'comes with' a butler, to handle any sight seeing, adventures, any needs, seated outside your door (again, not in gen. hotel hallway).

We had breakfast (complementary) every morning on the huge balcony, watching the sun come up over Diamond Head. The view is incredible. Sunset is visible too from the bedroom or balcony, and also incredible. There's a table/chairs for dining, two lounge chairs for relaxing.

The suite is a suite-it's big. There's a kitchen area, stocked mini-fridge, beverage area, dining table, half bath, living room, separate TV viewing/reading nook, large bedroom and ensuite with shower and Jacuzzi tub and large closet. There are windows everywhere so you can see Hawaii from almost every spot. There's a small balcony off the bedroom with one chaise.

Every day, staff would leave a little 'trinket', like a msg in a bottle with little note from the Halekulani, always flowers and Hawaiian water at bedside. Upon arrival, guests receive a Lei greeting. Some people wear them all the time; we didn't. The staff would arrange them into interlocking hearts-very sweet touch. 

There were a few weddings while we were there, and the grounds are perfect for it. We probably saw 1-2 brides every day somewhere in Honolulu or Waikiki.

We arrived early, got early check in with upgrade and the process took place in the room with a tour. The rooms are generous, the staff incredibly friendly and helpful with a very personal touch. The food options were reasonable. We ate at House without a Key which was standard resort prices and range and pretty good quality. Also ate at Orchids which was pretty costly, though the setting is spectacular. 
The location is central and ideal with easy walking access to top notch shopping and alternative eating spots. Overall I highly recommend for a high end luxury stay in the dynamic heart of Waikiki","Date of stay: February 2016","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Great hotel :)","My husband and I stayed at the Halekulani for four nights of our honeymoon. The hotel itself is beautiful and we found the staff to be very friendly and very helpful (everyone!). We stayed in a room on the 15th floor with an ocean view - and let me just say that it was  wonderful. The view was just breathtaking. Each morning I'd wake up and the first thing I did was walk out onto the balcony - the view was truly wonderful. We thought the small perks were very nice - esp. the fresh fruit in the room at check in. As well, the hotel left a complementary bottle of champagne in our room to congratulate us on our wedding, as well as chocolates, cookies, etc. (which seemed to be standard). We appreciated the late check out on our final day since it allowed us to enjoy a few last blissful hours on the beach and in the pool. Would 100% recommend! 

Would flag a few things that I would have liked to have known at the start of my stay: 1) self parking and valet parking cost the same, so don't bother self parking; and, 2) the chairs at the pool were first-come first-serve and guests would reserve seats by the pool early in the morning and then just leave them vacant for hours on end, which was kind of annoying (apparently this is against policy, but because things were on the slower side - they weren't kicking people off of their chairs), and 3) the internet service could be spotty.","Date of stay: February 2016","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

When you enter the open lobby, typical for Hawaii, and drink in the rich woods, marble and floral displays, you've already begun to relax. A welcome drink and off to your room where check-in is conducted. I have never liked in-room check-in. I find it awkward, uncomfortable and an unnecessary affectation. But that done, the suites are spectacular. For the Sunrise Breakfast  Package, with buffet breakfast for two at House Without a Key, or Full American Breakfast, at Orchids (except Sunday's where it's buffet only). Figure to spend $500/night for the least expensive courtyard-view room, to $2000/night for the 1000 sq.foot, Diamond Head Suite we had, all the way to $6000/ night for a Halekulani suite, season dependent of course. The suites feature magnificent views, private lanai's, separate bedroom and dinning room, and superior bathroom products. There is a wonderful Spa and Health Club, the incredible pool, with its iconic ceramic titled orchid bottom, and you are at the beach.
I already mentioned the two breakfast restaurants, but they are also open for lunch and dinner for casual fare.
The signature restaurant is the award-winning La Mer, featuring formal French preparations in a stunning teakwood setting, with Ocean views. The Menu Degustation ($195/person, add $95/person for wine pairings), Try the Duck Foie Gras to start, or Scallops, then the Kona Lobster or Filet of Beef Foie Gras. There is also a three course, $110/person, and four course, $145/person. In which case, the Lobster Bisque or pork trotter ravioli to begin. Red Snapper or Abalone. Or the seared lamb or Roast Duck. There is also a caviar offering.
A refined wine list, that is seriously overpriced, but contains some bargains and values. As with most high-end Hawaiian restaurants, the Champagne is ridiculously overpriced. Desserts are different. Have a soufflé if on offer.
So, the Halekulani is a magnificent, oasis and escape. It is the top end of Oahu. The class end. I throughly love and strongly recommend this hotel!","Date of stay: November 2015","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I had heard good things about this hotel and they were all true.

Valet guys are top notch, check in was short and sweet and handling of luggage prompt. The rooms are a bit on the smaller side, but I know that space is limited downtown Waikiki and most other hotels around there would have the same. Nothing to worry about though, still a nice desk, couch and seating area, lanai and very comfortable bed. The bathroom is nice too and they made most of the limited space there is. 

We spent most of our time in the hotel at the pool and it was easy to get lounge chairs. Everyone at the pool is super helpful and our pool-side server Adam went above and beyond to make our stay pleasant and memorable. He kept the Mai-tais coming at a great pace, whether we wanted them pool side or at our chairs. The food at the pool is surprisingly good too.

It's worth noting that this part of Waikiki beach is really slim and at points there is no beach at all (there are footbridges that take you there though). The hotel has access from the pool to a small sliver of the beach that is perfect if you want to dip in there. Our friends came to hangout with us and encountered a giant sea turtle there too. 

Overall you can't go wrong with this hotel, especially if you're thinking of spending time pool side. Top notch service, clean, great rooms - just wonderful.","Date of stay: February 2016","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The first of many disappointments is that fact that, although the resort bills itself as ""on the beach,"" it is actually on a seawall.  There is no beach associated with this property unless you count the 20-foot strip of coarse sand that also serves as a parking lot for a very large catamaran.  Sad to say, even this pathetic excuse for a beach virtually disappears when the tide comes up.  Yes, you can walk over to the proper part of Waikiki with ease, but then you are on your own, without a chair or an umbrella or a bathroom.  Have fun!

To be fair, the pool is beautiful and the area around it pretty and comfortable, with plenty of cushioned lounge chairs and nice towel service.  There were also, alas, plenty of crying babies and loud toddlers (and diaper-clad little ones in the pool-yuck), which did take the bloom off the orchid, so to speak.

Rooms are quiet, but disappointingly small for the price point, with bathrooms that, while clean, are small and dated.

Having just been to Tokyo, my experience is that the Halekulani feels more like a Japanese hotel than a Hawaiian one.  What it lacks in Aloha, it make up for in Japanese bridal parties, which clog the lobby and elevators.  The hotel's driveway was so congested with white stretch limos that on several occasions we had extended waits for our car. 

Then there is the dress code.  My husband and I are rather formal people.  We always dress for dinner, even when all around us are wearing jeans and flip flops.  We were dismayed, therefore, to discover that crisp Bermuda shorts and a dress shirt were deemed inappropriate for obtaining a cocktail at the only bar on the property (Lewers Lounge).  The following night, sporting ""appropriate"" attire (long pants, dress shoes), we discovered that the lounge was closed for a private event.  We actually had to go off property to get a drink on a Saturday night!

The best thing about our stay was the spa. It has a nice variety of services and skilled, professional therapists. Our overall experience, however, was less than wonderful. It is highly unlikely that we will ever return.","Date of stay: February 2016","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

While still wonderful, however, the hotel shows a few signs of slipping, and a refurbishment is probably not far off.  

We had Pool View suite 315 for our 6 nights.  It is a large, comfortable room with two balconies overlooking the pool and pool area courtyard.  Immediately upon checking into the room we first noticed a slight musty smell in the air.  Once in the room for a while you didn't notice it anymore, but every time we returned to the room we noticed it again.

We also found that the shutters in the bedroom were broken.  This is a privacy problem since the shutters close in lieu of curtains.  A call down to the front desk brought a repair person within 2 hours, and the problem was solved.

Using the telephone brought another problem to our attention.  The volume level on both telephones in the room was so low that we could barely hear half of what anyone was saying.  They were basically unuseable. 

Unfortunately, these were not the only problems in the room.  Room lamps are connected to mysterious black boxes, the purpose or operation of which isn't explained.  Whatever they do, the lamps kept clicking off on a whim.  Sometimes we were able to turn them back on, sometimes we couldn't, so I finally disconnected the lamps from the boxes and plugged them directly into the wall.  This solved the irritating problem.

Next, we noticed several light bulbs in the room were burned out.  We mentioned it to a housekeeper and new bulbs were brought up within 2 hours.  And speaking of housekeeping, every day when we left to breakfast we pressed the ""Make Up Room"" button but the room was never made up until long after our return.  Housekeeping seems to operate on their own schedule, and the button is useless.  Or perhaps we ate breakfast too early, earlier than housekeeping staff begin their day (8:30am?).

Breakfast staff at House Without A Key are mostly superb, in particular Sue and David.  One morning we had another gentleman, who I will not name, who was borderline surly - no smile, no personality.  We weren't even sure he was a server or just a busboy.  

Overall our room looked a bit worn and in need of renovation soon.  I had stayed two nights at the Kahala Hotel & Resort before switching to Halekulani to join friends when they arrived, which made me notice the contrast more than I might have otherwise.  Kahala is new, updated, modern and looks great.  Halekulani needs to renovate soon to keep up with Kahala.  

On the plus side the bed and pillows at Halekulani are extremely comfortable (better than Kahala Hotel, in my opinion) and we slept very well.  Most staff members are very personable.","Date of stay: January 2016","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

We have traveled to Waikiki now about 12 times and stayed at all the beach front hotels. The Halekulani has very good service, maybe a bit slack at times around the pool but you can be guaranteed a sun lounge at the pool, where other hotels nearby you need to be up early to get one. The rooms are smallish but on par with others in Waikiki, most have ocean views overlooking the Waikiki beach.The restaurants and breakfast are very nice. 

I must admit the Halekulani is not my favourite hotel in the world mainly due to its high price to stay here. but it does have nice rooms and good service compared to the other beach front hotels in Waikiki. If you have visited Hawaii a lot like us you will more then likely stay elsewhere nearby for value. if you can afford to stay here and want to spoil yourself its worth a stay once and awhile.","Date of stay: October 2015","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

So take the time to read this before you book this hotel. You should book this hotel for its location we have been looking for a location like this for our annual New Years holiday. That can become somewhere we can come every year without fail. Regardless of how you feel about the other reviews here you should the look to its next door neighbour and book there instead. I expect a 5 star resort not to have behaviour like a package holiday. I expect when a hotel takes the time to make clear hotel policy to guests by printing out a card to explain how the pool area is used the hotel ensure that is how it is conducted. I don't expect to be told oops sorry you went by the rules too bad even though you were up early enough and saw the pool area was empty so you were not worried. Come here if you like but expect poor mannered pool etiquette and a staff that clearly don't care. As relaxing by the pool is the first thing you do on holiday.

The other two -- the Royal Hawaian and the Moana -- are traditional, with an almost nineteenth-century feel, and quite American in their ambiance.  The Halekulani, by contrast, has a modern and Japanese-oriented sensibility.  It's brighter and more minimalist (without being spare in any way.)

The service is beyond exquisite.  The staff is endlessly courteous and attentive without being intrusive.  One of our favorite things to eat in all Honolulu are the popovers at the Halekulani's breakfasts.  On Sunday's, the restaurant serves only a big brunch, which was far more food (and far pricier) than we wanted.  So the concierge readily arranged for them to send two orders to our room.  It was the perfect end to a great three days.

The entertainment out looking over the ocean at sunset is traditional and enjoyable.  If you like a nonalcoholic drink, the frozen lemonade with mint is one of the most refreshing drinks around, and, ever helpful, the staff will minimize the sugar to your liking to make it really snap.

The Halekulani is a step above.  It is elegant, understated and pure luxury.  From the moment you enter, you are treated with great respect and consideration.  We had a beautiful room overlooking the pool area and ocean.  The pool was partially screened by palm trees.  The outlook from our balcony was serene and restful.  

What we noticed most was how quiet and meticulously maintained the hotel was.  Example-when the housekeeper came, not only was the room cleaned, but the balcony was mopped and the railings cleaned.  I don't recall ever being at a hotel where this was a daily ritual.  We were there during the marathon race.  The hotel had many families there, yet it was very quiet and pleasant.  We went to a couple of other hotels for dinner or just to observe.  They were noisy with lots of loud people.  We were very happy to return to our peaceful hotel.  One very nice treat was the little gift left on our pillow at turn down time.  One night it was a box of 2 cookies, one night a lovely notecard, a shell one evening, a key chain...What a nice break from chocolates each night - not that I don't love chocolate, but this was a welcomed surprise every evening - one that we had not seen before.

In the evening there was live music on the patio - a perfect spot to entertain friends or enjoy on your own.  We had dinner one evening at the Orchid.  Wonderful food, great service - a real treat.  The breakfast buffet was excellent - don't miss this. It is a great way to start each day.   We also had afternoon tea at the hotel - how civilized - thought we were in London with better weather and sunshine!

We loved the location of this hotel.  We have been to Honolulu many times and stayed in several places.  At first I thought this would be in a noisy,tourist filled whirlwind.  However, once you enter the hotel, you are in a cocooned world with no sense of any other activity on the island, yet, all the amenities of Honolulu just outside the door. 

If you have the opportunity to stay at this wonderful hotel - treat yourself.  It is pricey but well worth every penny.  It will be a stay that you will never forget.","Date of stay: December 2015","Trip type: Traveled on business","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

A GPS is made up of three components - control,space and user. - Sound familiar?

Don't we control the destination? Is the space the room we pick in the hotel we like? And then don't we use it when we arrive?

But what makes us decide on the destination? - Take Honolulu and the Halekulani hotel for example perhaps.....

I booked the Executive luxury suite ( Room 267) for a six night stay with the wife in January 2015. 

We decided to travel to Honolulu as we had to visit Los Angeles for a business trip,so we thought ""why not have a break in Honolulu before returning home""

We picked the Executive luxury suite because it offered,butler service,the option to order room service from the signature restaurant - ""La Mer"", in room spa treatments,comp limo transfers to/from the airport and of course - a nice view !

The hotel experience began well before we arrived. We were sent a guest profile email and asked a variety of questions so that our arrival and stay were more tailored to what we would like - questions included were - Butler service "" how many hours would you like this a day? - any particular butler you wanted if you were a return guest,what kind of beverages did we want the bar filled with,which paper would we like,what kind of pillows ( hard/soft/extra/hypoallergenic),spa menu and would we like to pre book to ensure we got what and when we wanted,did we want to pre book tours.

All in all a very comprehensive list which enhanced our stay and we did book some tours. The hotel arranged a private tour of Pearl Harbour for us with a retired US Navy submarine captain. This was a particularly exceptional experience and also a very moving experience emotionally as we moved through the museum and the USS Bowfin - the concierge did a great job here!

Arrival transfers went smoothly as did the ""in suite check in"" - on arrival to our suite which was adjacent to the Halekulani suite, I asked if the Halekulani suite was occupied for our dates of stay. As it was not,the hotel were kind enough to favorably consider my ""on the spot"" request to change into that suite at a reduced rate so that we both got a ""win/win""

So, all of a sudden we found ourselves in the magnificent Halekulani suite( room 270) one of the three best suites in the hotel.

I have attached photos of the suite,which has as a primary asset unbelievable views of Diamond Head and the beach. 

The suite itself is large and spacious. The private butler has a desk which is manned outside the suite. The butler takes care of anything that you need whilst you stay,restaurant bookings/recommendations  ( in hard to get into restaurants ) activities,tours,whatever you need.

You also get a reserved table and sun lounges next to the pool as part of the arrangement when you stay in the Halekulani suite.

The bed is very comfortable and the service from the butlers is fantastic.

The suite has two bathrooms. The Ensuite is quite large and has plenty of room.

The lounge is very comfortable as it the rest of the suite,but really we spent most of our time in the suite sitting on the Lanai overlooking the ocean and Diamond head.

The decor is what I suppose you would call ""classic Pacific island opulence""

We found the service in the hotel to be both highly professional as well as exceptional and front of house culture was as you would expect with a luxury hotel of this reputation.

So,back to our relativity discussion .... 

What you need to grasp about Honolulu is that a high end accommodation experience in a luxury hotel has a price value equation that is unreconcilable - you have to pay significantly more for this in Honolulu than you would in most other parts of the world.

At a rack rate of $6,000.00 USD a night plus taxes the Halekulani suite isn't the most expensive suite in the world,but what it delivers as bang for buck falls well short of what that kind of spend can buy you elsewhere.

The Executive Luxury suite that we had originally booked for $3,000 USD per night plus taxes also fell well short of what level of accommodation this would buy you in many other cities of the world.

The reality is that in Honolulu the market price for good views and a luxury suite are akin to taking a bazooka to a price comparison knife fight if you were to compare this with other luxury hotel suites in other cities with great experiences in terms of view.

But hey,you know all this when you book,so just ""suck it up princess"" if you want to roll out the luxury barrel!

Another interesting thing about luxury hotels in Honolulu is that they are mostly dated ( Look like 1980's era) in some form of another and the Halekulani is no exception to this, having a pool area that is in need of renovation.

 The pool furniture and tiles surrounding the pool are without doubt circa 1980's and this detracts significantly from the look and feel of the pool area.

Having travelled to most of South East Asia, the Pacific Islands and Australia,Honolulu offers a beach holiday that is quite different ""relative"" to most of that. - But that's the beauty of the theory isn't it? 

It's all relative to what you think !

8 out of 10 from me - 8 points mainly for the exceptional front of house team - 2 points off for charging ""Like a wounded bull"".","Date of stay: January 2015","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

At times this can give a bit of a dated look in bathrooms and public areas until one realizes that that is exactly the point.  The staff is generally very friendly and knowledgeable, the concierge services excellent, and the breakfasts near the ocean hard to beat.  The hotel seems to cater to the Japanese market, but we (non Japanese) did not feel out of place.","Date of stay: November 2015","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

It is an icon on Waikiki but is sadly poorly staffed and overpriced. Sure if you pay $600 plus (with tax) you can expect a nice room that is clean but really for the price I also expect all aspects of the hotel to meet or exceed expectations. The buffet restaurant serves the most average breakfast that I have had in a long time. The chef making the eggs is bored at best and plain rude at worse. We ate dinner in the high end silver service ""Le Mer"" where the food was excellent although very pricey. Don't expect large portions, but for an older couple like us that was fine. All meals are set with three course minimums. The lighting is very dim and the menus are very difficult to read given the small print and dark atmosphere. But, my biggest criticism is reserved for the so called sommelier (Henry?).  When asked for a Pinot Noir recommendation he first suggested a wine which was neither on the wine list nor available. His second recommendation was for the most expensive wine. Duh, I could have guessed at that one without his help. I felt that he might simply be interested in a larger amount that the 20% tip would give him. Quite pathetic. On a positive note the concierge who also handles the hotel in-house car rentals was most accomodating, knowledgable and friendly. My suggestion is to avoid the Halekulani and instead book at the Outrigger Reef Hotel next door at less than half the price. You won't be disappointed.","Date of stay: November 2015","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_20"

It is ideally situated on Waikiki Beach, and centrally located within walking distance to popular reataurants, shops,departmental stores, taxis and buses to all other activities. 

The hotel itself is exceptionally clean with beautiful floral displays throughout. There are threee restaurants in the complex, the main one 'House with no keys', is situated next to the pool its surrounding sun lounges and many pool attendants who are there to wait on the guests.  They offer the lunch menu from the restaurant, lay out the towels individually for the guests, access to cool water, and at around midday bring a piece of tropical fruit for the guests and then at 2pm a fruit ice cream to cool the remaining sunbakers.  At 5pm a band will st up and play Hawaiin music as the restaurant opens for sunset drinks and the evening meal service.  The other two restaurants are both located overlooking the beach and are more upmarket.
There is a small art gallery,jewellry shop and clothes/gift shop also on the premises, surprisingly the gift shop was reasonably priced.

The rooms all have ocean views and balconies. We were greeted with a vase of fresh flowers and bottle of sparkling French wine.  The rooms are cleaned and beds turned down each night with a small token gift left behind. Every Wednesday they hold a small  party with cocktails and canapes for the new arrivals, where you can meet some of the staff and mangers.  The staff were exceptional and there was never anything they couldn't do or find almost immediately.
For the 10 days we stayed it is not a wonder why there were many couples all dressed in white getting married in this exquisitely  calming and beautiful surroundings.

There is a smoking area, on the side for those that want to.","Date of stay: October 2015","Trip type: Traveled with friends","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Service is always good, the staff are always friendly but the room we were given was very underwhelming. It was small with a strange layout and a none existant view.

And the staff, all at the top of their profession.  One example: I left a pair of shoes to be shined overnight.  When they delivered them the next morning our privacy light was on outside the door.   Instead of knocking on the door, the front desk called me and said the gentleman was waiting outside to deliver my shoes, was it a good time?
The Halekulani just excites all of your senses.  I especially enjoyed live jazz at Lewers Lounge.

We'd only heard good things about the service, even from the hotels we had stayed in previously and the service was amazing from the start. 
Check in was welcoming and having someone take you to your room and point out the different restaurants, bars, pool area and in room amenities along the way was very helpful. We stayed in a Diamond Head Ocean view room and had stunning views of Diamond Head, the pool area and the beach. Our room was clean, bright, well furnished and had great amenities and bottled water available. As we were staying for a celebration, complimentary sparkling wine and delicious chocolate strawberries were delivered to the room shortly after check-in. 
It was so relaxing sitting on the balcony and enjoying the music from the House Without Keys that we ordered room service for the majority of our meals to make the most of it. Room service attendants were all friendly and set up our breakfasts and dinner on the balcony for us. 
We couldn't get a reservation at Orchids but we could order room service from their menu. The Kahuku Shrimp Ravioli was the best meal of our trip to Oahu! We did eat at House Without a Key one night which was great. The coconut cake for desert was delicious!
Pool area was great with lots of day beds and a large pool, apart from the server who was a bit rude and very unlike other staff in the hotel.

Some small things.","I've heard nothing but how amazing this hotel was for months, so I was incredibly eager to try it out. In most of the aspects, it did not disappoint. 

HOTEL OVERALL
Overall the property is clean, beautiful and immaculately kept. 

ROOMS
The rooms themselves were very nice with a ton of modern conveniences (outlets everywhere, touch screen by the bed, etc). Bathrooms were a bit disappointing as they didn't have many amenities and basic products. The shower was also very, very small. The separate area for the toilet was smaller than most airplane bathrooms I've been in. Oddly, I suffered some kind of allergic reaction to the room (which has never happened to me at another hotel) and kept me up with a sore throat, sniffles and other ailments. After about ten minutes of leaving the room, I was completely find. Very strange. 

SERVICE
The check-in process was great, with a front desk clerk escorting you to the room and offering a property. Felt very personalized. 

F&B service overall was generally good, especially in Orchids was great. Our evening having cocktails at House Without a Key was also nice, but I felt the server had too many tables and couldn't keep up. The hosts were great there. 

Pool service was great, except for the food server. There seemed to be one guy working (maybe two) and he was bringing us these Diet Cokes that were tiny and filled to the brim with ice, so they were gone in literally two seconds, especially as we'd just gone on a long walk. Each glass had maybe 3-4oz of soda total. After the third request for a refill in an hour, he just dropped the check unprompted and deliberately avoided us the rest of the day. It was really rude. Also they charge per soda, so my friend and I had maybe 9oz each of soda for $50.

FOOD & BEVERAGE 
Overall the food was good. Room service was prompt and I love the fact the server tosses your caesar salad for you to your liking. Orchids brunch was spectacular and everything you've read about. My one issue with the food is that there are very very few pupus on the HWAK menu. It's nice to have some pre-dinner drinks and snacks, but there's maybe 3 options total and very expensive for what you get. Royal Hawaiian's Mai Tai bar does it much better with a cheese platter, calamari, etc all with a nice Hawaiian touch.

Overall this is a very special hotel and really pretty. If you're looking for luxury in Waikiki it's worth considering.","Date of stay: October 2015","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

The tour shows us various hotel work behind the scene and you will meet the Hotel Ambassador, ""Auntie"" Melba, who has been working at Halekulani for many decades and a living legend at Halekulani and she will tell us many interesting stories about Halekulani. The tour ends with delicous sweets and tea. This tour illustrates the hotel's confidence in every details of hotel operations. Auntie Melba's excellent professionalism combined with her grace illustrates one of many examples of flawless of Halekulani. Friday music is worth going for. Their famous Sunday brunch provide you with unforgetable tropical treat. If you get some tropical fresh flowers from a local farmers market, the room service will provide a nice vase without being requested as if you have your butler with you.

We were able to book the second room that our son stayed in for half price over the summer.  This meant the hotel was actually cheaper than The Modern.  The rooms were very colonial and extremely comfortable and ambient.

The concierge staff were first-class and their dinner recommendation (Pah Ke's Chinese Restaurant in Kaneohe) was spot-on.  Our dinner guests -- folks who live in Honolulu -- had never heard of Pah Ke's, but we all agreed it was one of the best Chinese meals we'd had.

Food is good and access to all of waikiki shopping and name restaurants is a snap.  Great convenience store with fine wine, liquor, etc. fifty feet from the front. The hotel is Japanese owned and 80% or more of the guests are Japanese, which means it is quiet, meticulously clean and cultured.  Rooms are thoughtfully appointed and furnished.

This time we decided to really splurge and stay at the Halekulani.  Many people told us how great it was, it was the most expensive hotel in the area so our expectations were very high. 

The hotel is very nice, but a bit dated.  It needs a renovation in my opinion.  The main areas are in need of a revamp.  The ocean view standard room was very nice, large and had a very nice bathroom, but again, a bit dated.   Single sink in a $500 a night hotel is a bit off.  Separate shower and soaking tub was greatly appreciated.  Lots of nice toiletries.  The room did have a very large lanai with chairs which was great for morning coffee.  

Bed was a little hard for us. The room had a small love seat, a desk and lots of dresser space, and a nice closet.  Robes and slippers were provided and each night at turn down were put bedside in the Japanese fashion.  The hotel is Japanese owned and you will notice a largely Asian clientele.  They do nightly turn down and leave a sweet little gift on the bed each night which is a nice touch.   On our arrival night, they left us fresh fruit and chocolates which was great. 

There were tons of kids there when we went.  The only have one pool, many hotels have a kids pool and an adult pool, so there is no way of escaping the screaming children all day long.  The pool is deep enough to swim and each morning you would see lots of people doing laps. 

One thing to note is that the hotel is right AT the beach, but not ON the beach.  Its a funny little spot, where there is no beach or chairs on the beach for hotel guests.  This is what we missed the most.  Our usual spot down the road has a huge section of beach reserved for hotel guests.  You can exit the pool area and go past the hotel next door and get to the beach, but its a bit of a walk and then you can't take advantage of the food or drink service at the pool.  They have some great poolside drinks and nibbles.  

The location is what is really great, it is walking distance to everything, right across the street is a Denny's if you are craving some diner type of breakfast.  Roy's is also across the street for great drinks and dinner.  There is a ton of shopping and of course an ABC store within a block.    

There is no lobby bar or any bar for that matter, to sit at and have cocktails, this is also a bit odd.  They have an outdoor area with chairs near where they have evening music, but everyone was sort of dressed up, so it felt awkward to go there straight from the pool for a sunset cocktail.  We are more of the Mai Tai bar on the beach kind of people.  There is not much going on at the hotel in the evening, its very quiet.  A lot of the guests were much older, or families.  

The staff is exceptional, very 5 star, everyone is very polite, and right on point.  They are quick respond to any requests. 

It is a lovely hotel, mainly it needs a bit of a renovation.  Not the place if you want a bit of nightlife.","Date of stay: August 2015","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

There are no artificial ""alohas"" ,just excellent service almost everywhere you go in the hotel. Most of the rooms seem to have balconies and ocean views and our suite was attractive and immaculately serviced for our six day stay. Only the poor fitting bath robes and the absence of coffee making facilities in the room could you possibly fault. The breakfast arrangements are outstanding because you can choose to eat at a buffet restaurant or go to Orchids for only the a la  carte menu. Our choice was consistently Orchids,because you can avoid buffet queues and the constant movement of people with plates piled high. Overlooking the ocean at Orchids for breakfast,with immaculate service from professional waiters is a great way to start the day,even though the reception women at Orchids can be a little intimidating and less than friendly when requesting a table.

We travel often and Halekulani service meets five star expectations!   Every area of our experience was met with consistently high quality, professional and customer oriented service.  We booked rather last minute & required 2 rooms (us and our teen daughters) we were not guaranteed they would be together. At check-in the staff informed us they were delighted to have us in side by side rooms on a high floor with pool and ocean view just as we had asked.  Every interaction with staff thereafter was a delight - always an offer to be helpful from pool deck, to House Without a Key Restaurant, to housekeeping and on.  Also may I just thank the valet staff for their daily assistance (without prompting) for providing water on our way out for hiking/beach exploring and on return, subsequently whisking away our borrowed towels from the back of our vehicle before we could even reach for them ourselves.  Daily little gifts sent with the newspaper were a nice touch -our daughters enjoyed this!   
As for the property - it is lovely!   The space is casual beach elegance -well maintained and immaculate.  Also well monitored since it is essentially open along Waikiki.  Rooms are well designed and well maintained -again a nicely understated beach elegance.  One note -there is no private beach here -there is a lovely pool and very tiny public access to the ocean.  This should not impact your choice.   In reality if beaches are your interest, by all means rent a car -the beaches around the island are breathtaking - read up and chose/explore based on your interests.  We will absolutely return to the Halekulani should our travels bring us to Oahu again.

We booked a garden view room to keep a lid on expenses.  Our flight landed at 8.30AM, we took a taxi to the hotel ($40 US including tip). Rooms are not ready until 3PM, but that is not a problem at the Halekulani.  The Hospitality Suite is spacious, well stocked with refreshments (all without charge), and they also provided drink vouchers for the garden restaurant, House Without a Key.  Check in was in the room, and probably as we were staying nine nights, we were upgraded to the eighth floor with an ocean view (not Diamond Head). Staff attitude is first class, which was very pleasant, as we have stayed in so called five star hotels before where it was painfully obvious that staff attitude needed a shake-up. We loved the serenity of the hotel grounds, and if you needed more hustle and bustle you only needed to leave the hotel and cross the street.  Ocean swimming was only metres from the back gate, and very pleasant in the channel which nature provided through the reef.  Evening entertainment includes a Hawaiian band and dancers in the garden facing the beach, very enjoyable with the sun setting.  There is jazz later in the evening if that is your scene.  Just remember that tipping is an American Tradition and hotels pay their staff minimally in the expectation that you are the co-payer of their wages.  Ask the Concierge desk what level of tip is suitable for each service, they are very helpful (I have never seen better).","Date of stay: August 2015","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Outside - from many rooms you can view beautiful Hawaii, it's beaches, and its romantic setting in the evening.  The pools reflect the elegance of the Halekulani experience.

Landing is smooth and the chat with the driver is good and informative since I have not been here in almost thirty years.  He and I remember the Hawaii that his father knew.

At the desk I say ""Aloha.""  Lady at desk says, ""Do you have a reservation?""

We are brisked to the room and left perfunct.  If there was a welcoming amenity I have lost track of it.  I begin to wonder why we are paying over $2500 per night for these digs.  I get on the phone to order something to fill the empty fridge.

Good shower and some room service revives us enough to try the beach--but just a crowded path of sand exists anymore.  I begin to wonder why deniers of climate change don't come here for a convention.

The top restaurant here is haute French ...why?  The other restaurant's menu never offers a special of the day or of the season, why?  There is a bar/club offering jazz which attracted us to the hotel, but which was always closed to a private party each night we were there.  Huh?

Well, I could go on and even further on about the loss of heart and soul in what I thought in my youth would be a paradise for eternity. 

At checkout I say ""Aloha,"" to no response.  More than once.","Date of stay: March 2015","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_20"

The service at the hotel is first class.  Every one goes out of their way to make your stay special.  We had rooms with ocean views, but on the 3rd floor.  Given the lower level, we did not have the breathtaking views of Diamond Head that I had 24 years ago.  But the rooms were still very nice and the bathrooms were very well appointed.  We had dinner at Orchid's Restaurant.  I must say we were disappointed in the limited menu selections.  While dinner was good, it was not a great meal, as I would expect.  However, the morning brunch at the House Without a Key was fabulous each day with quick beverage service.  Overall, I am glad we stayed at this beautiful hotel.  It was one of the few luxury hotels that I found on Honolulu with a family plan -- the second room for our children was at a reduced cost.  Also, if you are looking for a great beach, be prepared for the small beach that is in front of the hotel.  But we found the pool area to be very nice and well kept.  It was never too crowded. I would stay there again, but I would ask for a room on a higher level with a Diamond Head view.","Date of stay: August 2015","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Also, pool area seemed to be extremely understaffed.  Only saw one server for the entire pool area.  I'm sure a lot of this is due to summer vacation with the family.  At this time of year, not a place to go have a relaxing time.  It would be nice if they had an adult pool.  When my trip needed to be extended, we decided to move down the street to The Modern which we new from past experience had an adult pool.  
Only other problem was that there was no hot water for two of the three mornings that we were there.  The manager took care of this by comping us one of our nights.  Very nicely done.

Everyone jumps to serve you and address any request.  Thoughtful touches like muffins and ice cream handed out while you're lounging at the pool are prevalent.   I had to go to the business center to print a document out and fed ex it, and the two ladies working there practically fell over themselves to help me and make it super easy.

We stayed in the tower since that was the only place one could stay. A beautiful room over looking the ocean, don't get much better than that.
Last month, 2015 for those of you, never mind. My wife and I visited the islands with a 5 day stop in Honolulu and off to the DA Big Island Man. Stayed in the Kona area at a lovely mom and pop hotel. We walked and walked exploring that Island. Rented a car and drove up the mountain to see the volcano. The weather was clear and COLD, yep what a difference in Temp from lovely Kona area to the top of the mountain. Since this was a special time for us I rented a vehicle with driver to pick us up upon arrival at the airport back in Honolulu. When we arrived no car, no driver. finally some one  with a sign asked if we were the one's who made the reservation. Now don't do this, one must now carry your own bags to the car which is through the parking garage, stinken parking garage to the car. Mean while the Halekulani is waiting
Arrived in time for after noon drinks on the Lani, its always time for afternoon drinks. The room was elegant, the service was impeccable, the hotel people were grand and so are the prices but what the hell, it only happens once right.
Would we do it again, well its a lot of money, we stayed over night, the hotel gave us a car to take us back the the airport and off we went to SFO for another day and night and day of eating and and and. Off to Reno the following the next after noon and back at it as they say.

You have arrived in center of calm and peace in the middle of hustle and bustle of Kalakaua Avenue. Since I grew up on Oahu, I have watched the transition of this property grow from small green bungalows and gardens to high rises. On our many trips back we have always gone to the hotel's beachfront restaurant House Without a Key for drinks, dinner and hula but we have never stayed at the hotel. Prior to this trip we have usually stayed elsewhere primarily with family or The Royal Hawaiian's original pink lady building because of it Hawaiian tradition and the fact that I had birthday parties and took cotillion there.  But since we were celebrating my 50th high school reunion we decided to do something different this time. We stayed a few nights at the Hale Koa because that is where some school friends were staying and then we transferred to the Halekulani-very glad e did!. We arrived prior to check in time so we were invited to have a complimentary drink and wait by the pool. While we waited free cream popciles were distributed by the pool staff-something we later learned they do twice a day for pool guests. Within 30 mins we got a call that our room was ready.  Prior to going to our room a cheerful rep escorted us around the hotel who informed us of the different places to eat and shop, introduced us to the concierge and then took us to our room. My husband and I were on cloud nine the minute we walked into our direct ocean front view room-sheer beauty. Fresh papaya and chocolate were on the coffee. Our bags arrived within seconds. The closet between the bedroom and the bathroom had sliding doors that push back so we could enjoy the ocean view even while brushing out teeth! Our bed was extremely comfortable and we loved the abundance of pillows. Every night a printed thought for the day card and token were left on our bed. Once we walked out of our room and the minute we did a man vacuuming at the far end of the hall turn off the vacuum and waited until we got on the elevator to start up again-very thoughtful. We did not find our hotel room or other parts of the hotel in need of updating. We read on our room's balcony to enjoy the balmy ocean breeze. The floral arrangements throughout the complex are magnificent- assorted ginger and orchids. On Wednesday were invited to the manager's reception which was another 5 star touch.The Halekulani remains secluded because the hotel reps are constantly walking the property insuring its for quests only.  Also you will see several international couples getting married at the hotel. We think this is the place to splurge but the stay is priceelss and we will come back. We suggest you read the history of the hotel on their website and view the historical pictures before you go-it adds so much meaning to the experiencing of staying at the Halekulani.","Date of stay: June 2015","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

My husband travels a lot for work and sees hotels of various quality all over the world. As a family we're fairly seasoned travelers and are willing to pay more for a hotel than an average family of four. We landed on the Halekulani based on reviews from other guests and we're looking to escape a bit of the craziness of Waikiki while we were in Honolulu. 

The hotel presents itself as a high end hotel, and tries to set that mood right upfront at check in. We didn't wait long to be helped, but after the standard check in routine, our keys and packet of information were handed off to another hotel employee so we could be escorted to our room. I'm sure some people would find this a luxury, we were just annoyed. When we tried to let them know it was unnecessary, we were told it was hotel policy and they wouldn't let us go to our room alone. We had a two bedroom suite for my husband, myself and our two teenage daughters. Upon entering the suite we discovered the master bedroom was made up of two short twin beds pushed together and the adjoining room had a king. Our escort was shocked when we were displeased that the kids would be sharing a king while my husband and I would be in our own twin beds! They made it right, but our escort had to call a manager and the excuse was we didn't make a bed request when we made the reservation. Who expects a master to be twins and the second room to be a king??

The hotel had lots of features that were nice but a bit odd. Wifi our first night was lightening fast and then slower than average after that. The lights were controlled by a central control box, but not all the lights turned off with the box. The AC was set high, maintenance had to come fix it, twice once for the main suite and the again for the adjoining bedroom. The adjoining room had a closet that opened into the bedroom and the bathroom, so if both sides were open the sink could be seen while lying in the beds. The AC unit was in the closet!  The bathroom was amazing and there was a wonderful walk in closet in the master bath, but the water pressure was light. 

Our second night we were just about asleep when an alarm went off in the room. We called the front desk and they were confused, said it was hotel wide and an accident, no big deal it happens. We're trying to settle down to go to sleep and the front desk calls and wants to know which alarm went off - how would we know? They wanted to send maintenance up to take a look. The next morning around 9, the alarm goes off again, this time followed by a fire Marshall message saying evacuate. A message in Japanses follows. We head downstairs and we're one of maybe 3 clearly English speaking families to be downstairs for the fire alarm. Everyone else is going about their usual business. My husband checks with the front desk to be told it was a drill and a message followed to not evacuate. Well, it wasn't in English!

The pool was a bit of a disappointment as well. It was very warm and chairs are tough to come by. We were actually looking forward to the pool after reading a notice in the room stating that pool chairs left unoccupied except during the lunch hour would be assumed vacated and other guest would be allowed to use them. If you've been to Hawaii you know pool chairs are a nightmare to secure unless you're up early and claim your spot. So we thought the hotel policy was refreshing. We went to the pool and we're told that policy was not enforced. 

Another policy not enforced is the use of swim diapers. While I understand that's a tough one to monitor, if you don't enforce it, you should be prepared to clear the pool when a kid poops in it. I was completely grossed out when a toddler was brought out of the pool by his parents screaming because he'd pooped and it had exploded out of the diaper and onto his back and shirt. The parents were obviously embarrassed and rushed him to a back corner to clean him up. They didn't inform the pool staff. When I mentioned it to the pool attendant I was met with anger. He was clear that unless I was willing to say I saw poop in the pool, he wouldn't do anything. I suggested he at least talk to the parents, but he was furious that I'd suggest that. His attitude and interaction with me was some of the worst I've ever seen from someone in a service position. 

Needless to say, I was done with the pool and honestly it was the last straw with the hotel. We won't be back. I'd recommend you search elsewhere for an upscale hotel because this one misses the mark.","Date of stay: July 2015","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

The hotel is first class throughout, from the decor to the service. The Orchids restaurant is superb and the Room Without a Key is a perfect place to relax with a Mai Tai and listen to the ukeleles. Sounds corny but actually it's surprisingly heavenly. Highly recommended.","Date of stay: November 2014","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The staff are so helpful, gracious and warm and make you feel right at home. It is a quieter hotel in a very busy area. In the evenings it was lovely to sit outdoors and listen to live Hawaiian music. It was tasteful and relaxing. We have two children and also spent time in another hotel along Waikiki before the Halekulani and left there feeling exhausted, frazzled and needing a holiday! Although the Halekulani could perhaps offer some activities or crafts during the day, there is plenty to do along the Waikiki area.

We took up the offer of interconnecting rooms with a substantial discount for the second room. This is an excellent offer and the rooms are spacious with comfortable beds. The ocean facing rooms have a lovely view and feel close to the ocean. The Halekulani is a hotel that is a pure pleasure to visit.","Date of stay: July 2015","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I was there for the week of July 4th - and really the only drawback this time was the pool chair situation - there are only a few umbrellas around the pool and I found I had to fight for shade. I started waking up at 6am to go down and reserve a spot under an umbrella - and even at 6am almost all of the chairs were gone! And people reserve chairs and they are left virtually unused - while the ""rules"" state that chairs are reserved during lunch for 2 hours from 12 - 2 - that rule is not enforced and people leave for hours and the best spots are unavailable. The more assertive you are - the more likely you are to get a good spot by the pool! Otherwise - this hotel ROCKS!!! The service is impeccable - the rooms are large and the beds and linens are luxurious. Plus this hotel is located right on Waikiki and you are seconds away from all of the best shopping and dining. The pool is beautiful, the views of Diamond Head are amazing!  The Mai -Ti's are yummy and the food is fresh and delicious. This is an expensive hotel - but worth it!

We were met by very friendly staff who found us a great table, fast service with complimentary chips to snack on, and then drinks delivered promptly.
We never felt over done by the staff and never waited too long to order more or be asked if there was anything we required. Just perfect!
The mojito was one of the best I have had, and the ahi sashimi was top notch. If you get a chance definitely order the coconut shrimp with mango dipping sauce and a fine NZ wine.

It is not just a gorgeous place to stay at Waikiki, it is a special destination of its own. The moment you arrive in the hotel you understand that it is all about class, elegance and luxury and comfort of the guests. The arrival and check-in were flawless, the staff surrounds you with their care nevertheless respecting your privacy. The suite where we were staying was just amazing, the beautiful balcony with the view over Waikiki beach, the luxurious bedroom and spacious living room were sophisticated in design, but very cosy and comfortable. Our kids got kids bathrobes (of 2 sizes!) and amenities on arrival and cookies & milk before bedtime. Every evening housekeeping was living a good night note upon turn down with a nice little memorable gift. 
The hotel hotel area is vast and very well-maintained, with a garden inside, large pool area, spa and several restaurants offering to its guests both fine-dining and casual options. A la carte breakfast in Orchids restaurant was a beautiful experience - food was exquisite and service impeccable, everybody looks well after our kids as well, they had special entertainment kits, cups, etc. 
Every evening the hotel restaurant had its own Luau, so you don't need to leave the hotel to enjoy traditional Hawaiian dance and music and cocktails, though we have thoroughly enjoyed it every evening from our balcony, looking at the spectacular view of the sunset over the ocean.
But what is a real pleasure - is to avoid Waikiki buzz and dip into the spectacular Halekulani pool.....it is spotless and elegant, service around the pool is very friendly, offering you complimentary water spray and sun protection, you can also access the beach, if you wish. From my point of view the hotel is an ideal place to enjoy gorgeous Oahu, the beauty of the island and the elegance of the hotel fit each other very well!
Special thank you to Concierge team, which was always friendly, honest and helpful.

And I would put the Halekulani equal to or better than any of them.  A lovely property with some of the best service anywhere.

Disclaimer here:  We were guests of the Halekulani on account of my traveling companion--an agent who does corporate travel bookings--having won a complimentary three night stay here as part of an employee appreciation promotion in his office.  While we were certainly grateful to the Halekulani for their generosity and kindness, what we experienced and observed is otherwise unvarnished.

The Halekulani has carved out a slice of peace and calm from the hubbub that surrounds it in central Waikiki.  Once you leave the hotel, Kalakaua Avenue and Beach Walk are a block away.  But the grounds and the public areas are quiet--an oasis of sorts.

Our check-in was informative and personal, with an experienced front desk agent doing a minimum in the lobby, then completing the process in our room.  She was a pro--am guessing had been in the employ of the hotel for years--and pointed out many aspects thoughtfully as she got us situated.

The room on the 14th floor was the ocean view category, and afforded beautiful panoramas of the pool, ocean and a few adjacent hotels.  The terrace for our room was huge, with room for a table and chairs, as well as a sun chaise.  Unfortunately, the morning sun made the balcony rather hot for morning coffee--after about 730a, the shade was gone--so if that is a consideration for you, a room facing oceanfront or in the other direction might suit you better.

Some of the reviews on Trip Advisor complain that the hotel appears dated.  Frankly I am baffled as this.  The design of the hotel is very classic and understated, and I suppose someone for whom this sophisticated look is not customary might mistake this for being dated.  Our nicely proportioned room was in beautiful shape, from the corners to the well thought out closets (they open into both the room and the bathroom) to the lovely bathroom.  Beds are very comfortable, and the sitting area makes the room residential in feel.  I love the countless details, from postcards in the stationery folder to great amenities in the bath.

The pool area is a delight, complete with pool butlers who hand out pineapple and popsicles in the afternoon, and refill spritz water bottles so you can mist away the heat at your leisure.  (The poolside restrooms even have those famed Japanese TOTO toilets you have to experience. . .)

Given that so many guests have late flights out of HNL, the hotel’s hospitality suite--reminiscent of an airline club lounge--is such a thoughtful touch.  Lockers, showers complete with all the amenities, changing rooms, coffee and cold drinks, reading material.  Access to this really enables you to utilize your whole last day before a red-eye flight.

Overall, Halekulani reminded me of my best hotel stays in Asia, from the wonderful intuitive service to the understated elegance (think the Peninsula/Regent/Four Seasons/now Anantara Bangkok or the Seiyo Ginza in Tokyo).  

A few small quibbles:

1)  Waikiki Beach has experienced some significant erosion in parts, the worst of which is oceanside at Halekulani and the adjacent Sheraton Waikiki.  So while the hotel is oceanfront, there is no beach to speak of directly in front of the hotel.  You’ll have to walk over to the Royal Hawaiian where the beach begins again in earnest.

2)  The hotel breakfast buffet is predictably expensive, and well provisioned.  However, I have had amazing hotel breakfast spreads in Asia, and this one pales by comparison.  Good, very good in fact--just not superlative.

3)  The fitness center is prettier than it is wonderful--including beautiful piece of workout furniture that likely set the hotel back a lot, but that we really had trouble figuring out.  Some nice views of the pool and water here too.","Date of stay: May 2015","Trip type: Traveled with friends","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Upon checking in, the front desk asked us if we were familiar with the property and we mentioned we had gotten married here 3 years ago. 15 min later in our room, the hotel had sent up a complimentary bottle of champagne with a nice hand written note congratulating us on our anniversary. As to the hotel itself, the facilities are amazing and updated. The rooms are not as large compared to similar levels of hotels on the big island or Maui, but remember this is Waikiki where land is more at a premium.

The Halekulani pool is amazing with great waiters (especially Adam). The beach out the front is great because it is a small enclave where not many other ppl swim. Very easy to sit by the pool and then swim in ocean.
The two restaurants (Le mer and orchids) had amazing views but the food was too formal for my liking (esp at Le mer). The views at sunset really are incredible though.

There is no beach access,  there is a public passageway with a water sports shop and a tree that homeless people slept under during the day. The pool is boxed in with a very obstructed view, there is no entertainment at the pool, and the atmosphere is more like a ""shushed"" library.    The pool furniture is worn and needs to be replaced.  If the beach and pool area are not important to your trip to tropical paradise, then by all means you will love this hotel.

When choosing the hotel for this stay in Waikiki, we narrowed it down to who had the best pool....but the Halekulani is so much more than a large, peaceful pool with a plethora of banana lounges and umbrellas, set amidst lush grounds. It is truly an oasis in the middle of a fabulous natural paradise and man-made shopping and eating heaven! Ahead of our arrival, I requested a room further towards the end from last time we visited. Our wish was granted with a fabulous room, right on the end, 1068. It has the full panorama of Diamond Head, Waikiki, the pool and grounds of the Halekulani, with the bonus of a door and small, additional balcony for extra ocean and sunset views. Upon arrival, we were welcomed back ""Home"" several times and thanked for our patronage. (Yes, we have stayed here a bit!) At the Halekulani, they show genuine care and pleasure in making your stay as enjoyable as possible. As you walk around the resort, everyone greets you, and makes you feel welcome. The rooms are spacious and clean, with everything you need. Service of those rooms is fast and efficient. All in all, during this stay, I have been most struck by the increased attention to detail (is that possible?) and the superb level of service. The only people relaxing at the Halekulani are the pampered guests!","Date of stay: June 2015","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

All I can say is WOW!

Before we left, I naturally read the latest reviews and must admit that I didn't get all the hype about the spectacular customer service.  Now I get it.  This property must have the most amazing training program for its team as their execution of customer service is simply incredible.  It is hard to quantify but you really do feel like a valued customer.  Everyone goes out of their way to make you feel welcome, from the housekeeping staff that remembers your name, to the room service staff that seems to appear at your door in seconds, to the IT team who helps get your Apple TV working.  Not to rave, but they really do an excellent job here.

We stayed in a Jr. Suite with an ocean view - 543.  These rooms are great.  They are on the corners at the end of the hallway (there is a property map on the website).  We were lucky enough to get one with a view of the pool and then out to Diamondhead.  The view was phenomenal.  The room has a small but separate sitting area with a small couch, desk and bar area; the extra space was nice to have.  Huge king bed with amazing views!  The bathroom was good with a walk in closet area.  The room more than met our expectations.

We did the brunch again and loved it.  We also had massages at the spa, which were great.

The hotel went out of its way to acknowledge our anniversary with a bottle of champagne.  Room service was always willing to bring ice and champagne glasses when we bought our own.  They also provide a fruit plate on arrival and each night they leave a little sort of ""gift"".  One night was a wooden tag - sort of like a luggage tag but super cute.  Another night it was a notecard with a beautiful picture of the area, the last was a pretty shell in a gift box.  Again, it is the little gestures that make you see how they go the extra mile.

The only critique I can think of is that the WiFi was not always the smoothest.  But it was included and ultimately did work.  The hotel is older (100th anniversary is in 2017 I think they said?) and it does show in the hallways but the rooms (at least ours) was very nice.

If you want to stay in Waikiki, this is definitely the place!","Date of stay: May 2015","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Service is outstanding, common areas impeccably maintained, gardens well tended to, accommodations as luxurious as your tastes (and bank account) can entertain, and the cuisine is exactly what fine dining is all about.

Can't say much more than that - if luxurious vacations are your thing and you want to experience the beach and exclusive shopping venues - this is the place to be.  For shopping, drop by the T Galleria by DFS, steps down the street.

I'm not a fan of crowds or standing in line for a restaurant or anything while on vacation. The Halekulani makes sure your vacation is without any waiting or lining up for breakfast or a pool chair. There are no crowds here. Even with the hotel at full capacity you still feel like the staff is ready to assist with whatever you need. The pool is serene and generally quiet with few screaming children. Take a walk along the beach and see what awaits guests at other Waikiki beach hotel pools. You will want to rush back to the peace and luxury of the Halekulani.

But this hotel distinguishes itself by the real practice of 5 stars starting from check in up till the check-out. This hotel is for those who value the real meaning of 5 stars service and look for sharp details. It is therefore noticeable that majority of hotel guests are either honeymooners or quite families with considerable less noise compared to other hotels in the area with more kids activities.
When we checked in, our room was not ready as we checked in early, however at the reception they gave us complimentary vouchers with either a drink at the pool or 15 minutes foot and scalp massage. We selected the massage treatment, though it was short but was enough to recover from jetlag. Our ocean view room were excellent and we were impressed of the fantastic view of the ocean. The difference between the full or partial ocean view is basically that in the full view, you can see the ocean from your bed, while the partial view you have to go to the lanai to see the ocean.
Room service was amazing and in full compliance of real 5 stars service.
Rooms are spacious and has all amenities. Only two cons in the room was the soft mattress and aged carpet in the bathroom.
The breakfast was excellent in House without a key restaurant with an amazing view of the ocean during dining. 
Concierge was also excellent and they gave us clear description of all available packages with clear pros and cons for each package.
Location of the hotel is amazing and close to all shops and restaurants. Due to the excellent location, I don’t recommend to rent a car
Up till last day of our stay, the hotel continues to prove that they are the best in Oahu. I requested a late check out, and they gave me another room with late check out which was really a nice compliment to suite our late flight. Even the last moment in the hotel was another 5 stars treat. We order a taxi from the valet to drop us at the airport. To our surprise, we found a huge limo car with the regular fare to airport.

Everybody was very polite, we had a nice room, that might need a little update, but was still fine. During our stay there was some renovating going on in one of the Restaurants. Therefore the hotel offered complimentary excursions every day. We joyned a sailing tour on a catamaran which was wonderful, we even saw a whale during that tour. We had breakfast in both restaurants that were open, one had a buffet, the other one was a la carte. We also had dinner one night in the outside Restaurant that was under construction and therefore onlay offered a bbq with a salad buffet. The breakfast was very good but too expensive. One half of papaya was more than 10 $  (I can´t remember exactly, may be 12 $?), which I think is not acceptable. At the bbq my husband had chicken, which was nothing special, I am a vegetarian, so I asked for the salad buffet only. There was a very limited selection of salads, also nothing special, and I had to pay more than 20 $ (I´m not sure, may be 26 $?), which was way too much for what they offered and for the quality. Nevertheless, you can find lots of good places to eat in short distance. If you decide to have breakfast at the hotel, at least make sure that you get a table with a view over the ocean, so you get something for the money you pay.

It has an elegant air about it and is far more upmarket than the other hotels on this strip of beach. However it is not ageing well at all , the rooms are old fashioned and a little grotty and the beds are a disaster !! Mattresses soft and floppy they must be so old, I had to ask for boards and still was the most uncomfortable sleep I have had in a hotel. 

The grounds and public areas are lovely , the beach has eroded so much since our visit last year that there is no beach in front of the hotel at all any more. The local authorities need to address this there is not a lot of beach left until you get to the Pink Palace!

The restaurants need attention the carpets in La Mer are horrible, it's a gorgeous location and fantastic food but needs a makeover. The bbq area is great and the food is always excellent there. The Traditiional Hawaiin Band and Singer in the Garden Terrace every evening create a lovely atmosphere . Orchids is a great location and have always found the food to be of a high standard. I do think the Breakfast buffet is atrocious truly atrocious , really poor choices and quality. 

Most of the staff are very friendly but are not overly accomodating with requests unless it's the standard offering!  We had dramas this stay and the previous stay with their slow processing of credit card payments and holding amounts for a week after payment had been made. This happened both stays and I feel the Japanese owners need to modernise their processes at this hotel. Quite outdated. 

We stayed in ocean view suites and rooms both stays and would recommend these as the view of Diamond Head is spectacular.

In other words, I was paying a premium for the extraordinary service.  I was sorely disappointed upon my arrival when the valet service personnel were nowhere to be found, the bell man was rude and failed to even greet my wife or even  my two year old son, and the front desk receptionist was professional but unfriendly.

I would recommend skimming through the reviews because you will discover that many reviewers find that this hotel is nothing special.  The staff seem to be disgruntled and most of them fail to even acknowledge you.  The pool service is non-existent as you have to go retrieve your own towels and drinks. 

The bottom line is this hotel is nothing special for them to be charging near the higher end of luxury hotels.  If you want a really nice room with free wifi and an extremely comfortable bed and don't have any expectations for service/pool, then this hotel is for you.

We also overlooked the beautifully tiled pool and expertly manicured courtyard which features nightly Hawaiian entertainment under the Kiawe Tree.  We loved sitting on our balcony/Lanai  and enjoying this relaxing music and watching the Hawaiian dancers.    The bathroom includes a shower and separate tub and a vanity large enough to include a vanity stool which I loved!  We purchased the breakfast package which allowed you to choose the buffet served at La Mer location or off the menu at Orchids.  We really enjoyed both options.  We made our reservations for dinner at Orchids and La Mer months in advance so we could request oceanfront/sunset views.  Both of these restaurants are excellent and I have reviewed them separately.  This location does have a small front beach area but there is lots of beach front on both sides with plenty of room for everyone.  A wonderful boardwalk runs from the Halekulani property to the beach front.  After seeing the other hotels in the area and how crowded they were, I was so glad I chose the Halekulani.  There were a lot of people here but somehow it never felt crowded or overwhelming.  I would definitely recommend and return to the Halekulani.","Date of stay: March 2015","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Bed and pillows were of high quality (never have I slept in a bed better than my 9k temperpedic bed at home, but this came real close). So close to everything, restaurants and shopping. 

Cons: Can't think of one at this moment- oh yes, woke up to the noise of the city. Not the hotel's fault, but the nature of staying in a big city. Oh, water was not always offered when taking the car out from the valet. That would have been a nice touch each time.

How the the hotel ""rescue"" our vacation?  Here goes… arrived to Oahu for a wedding. Spent the first 3 nights at Turtle Bay Resort. Did not go nearly as well as hoped (see my review for that if you're interested). Arrived to Honolulu for the last 2 nights of the entire stay, checked into Halekulani. One of the first things said to us while we waited for our room to be ready was, ""leave your bags here, don't worry, we'll take care of everything."" The bellman to the valet was nice and prompt, no wishy washy business. The area in front of the hotel was busy with cars but always kept moving. 

The room was gorgeous with a view (we stayed in a Diamond Head ocean view room). I wish we stayed longer. After a long day doing wedding stuff with my family we would return to the hotel and just feel so pampered. Small gifts to take with us were left by the hotel. Robes and slippers laid out by the bed side, waters by the night stand, even a bathroom mat by the toilet (don't you hate it when it's cold when sitting on the toilet?). I can't say enough good things and would return to stay here the next time I am back in Honolulu.","Date of stay: April 2015","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The room was large with a king size bed, small sofa and chair. We had a balcony with a lounger and table and chairs. The bathroom was also large with a good sized shower - we had no issues with a lack of hot water.

The hotel is right on the beach but go out the other side and you are at the end of one of the shopping streets with bars and restaurants.

Waikiki is very built up and busy so being able to go into the calm of the hotel was much appreciated. Although the bit of beach outside is small, it was perfect for getting in the sea and experiencing the waves. You can lie on loungers round the pool and near the beach and watch the world go by (and drink cocktails - careful though they are strong!)

Service was good and we enjoyed breakfast everyday at Orchids and cocktails every night at House without a key listening to the band (excellent) and watching the hula dancer amazing grace and control). We ate at orchids one night and had bbq at HWAK another. Both good meals sitting next to the sea.

Our room (#533) was spacious and tastefully furnished.  The linens and towels as well as the soap, shampoo, etc was first-rate and provided a nice touch.

Nice touch with champagne in the room as a thank you for choosing the hotel for our celebrations
The hotel is smaller and more intimate than many others and it is your hotel and no body else's, not like many of the others that are basically small shopping malls with a hotel reception stuck in the middle of them.
The in house restaurants were fantastic. The ""Orchid"" provides top class food and service but if you want to take it to another level, you must eat in the ""Le Mer"".
Superb cocktail bar hosted by Herman (you are the man) for a pre-dinner drink. Each Cocktail comes with its own hand picked accompanying aperitif.
Then comes the meal which is fantastic. Don't get me wrong this comes at price but its worth it. If budget is an issue, eat at a few cheaper restaurants a couple of nights so you can treat yourself to eat here.

What I found a little surprising was the lack of coffee or tea making facilities in the room. I appreciate there are plenty of food outlets on or nearby, but to have to go out for a coffee or get room service is inconvenient when even the cheapest motels have a kettle and tea bags.

Did we miss something?","I am not really sure why this hotel is so acclaimed; it missed the mark for us.

Yes, the service was very good (with one exception at one restaurant), but frankly that is a given at this price ($2,435 per night, for a 2-BR suite, that did NOT have a view of Diamondhead, by the way). The service, while very good,  was no different or better than *similarly priced* hotels, so it simply met our expectations in re service.

The location is good, in the heart of Waikiki, but it is squished in amongst very ordinary hotels and across from a Denny's.  And the beach is absolutely tiny, about the size of a modest living room, and not in any way private.  This may simply be the limitations of Honolulu and Waikiki, but it does mean that the hotel grounds are nothing to speak of, and leaves me scratching my head as to why this is supposedly such a special hotel.

The hotel has a wonderful history, but, unless we missed something (that is possible; we were not given any kind of tour or introduction to the property), nothing old remains.  The hotel itself is as nondescript as a 1970s Florida apartment building. There is no sense of history at all or really anything unique or special about the building, the grounds, or the setting.

We did have a very large and very nice room (again, for the price, we should expect that).  It was room 510, with a second room connected to it I believe. We had a very large living room and dining area with a balcony, and a bedroom with bathroom at either end.  The smaller bedroom, which I think was part of a standard room, had a pretty small bathroom.  Our bedroom had an enormous bathroom, probably 10x14 or so, with a separate walk in closet. It was very nice, but I would bet the tile was 20 yrs old. Not old enough to be historic but not new enough to be on trend.  The beds were great.  The decor was nice but not anything to get excited over. There were fresh flowers. Room service was prompt and accurate, which is a bit rare and so appreciated.

One thing I really resented was that the hotel was doing some sort of renovations while we were there. At check in, the front desk said, I assume you were made aware when you booked that we would be under renovation?  Umm, no!  I would never book at luxury hotel when it was under renovation.  That really galled me, that I was not told in advance at a property of this caliber. In fairness, they did offer little amenities due to the disruption, such as free surfing lessons.  That was a nice touch.

But, the one casual restaurant was operating in a very limited mode because of the renovation.  As a result, the menu was limited, the quality was average at best, and we were rushed through our meal.  It was a bad meal and bad service by any standards, but greatly aggravating to occur at a ""5-star"" resort and costing $300 for a casual family dinner sans alcohol.

Is this hotel ""average"". No.  But, for a luxury hotel, we found it to be only average and we were disappointed.","Date of stay: March 2015","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

This is definitely not a 5 star hotel.

My husband and I selected the Halekulani to celebrate our honeymoon. We were visiting from Western Australia. We had 4 nights on Maui previously and stayed at the Montage, Kapalua Bay. Now if luxury is what you are after, then that is where you want to be (see separate review). Perhaps we were spoiled at the Montage because the Halekulani was nothing in comparison.

The Halekulani is outdated and in need of a refurbishment - as a minimum. We were upgraded on arrival to a room with a ""partial ocean view"". It was not much of a view and in the upgrade we lost the king bed that we had reserved in our original booking. Room was small and the shower TINY! You wouldn't want to drop the soap, you wouldn't be able to bend over to pick it up. The shower was luke warm at best and on two mornings our shower was cold.
The rug on the floor of the bathroom looked like it hadn't ever been cleaned (why a rug is even necessary in the bathroom i don't know!).

Pool area was outdated and was lacking atmosphere. The grounds were boring, lawn needed a mow, furniture was dated and old and needed replacing. In general it was bland and definitely not fitting for what is supposed to be a ""luxury"" hotel.

While the bed was comfortable, we could hear the pipes from the room above when the guests were in the shower (very annoying). 

Food at the hotel was ok. The buffet breakfast was very average and we were both sick from the food. Following that, we ate at Orchids (a la carte breakfast) which was nicer. Service also very good.

We did eat at La Mer as a special treat. Very very very expensive (especially for Aussies and the current exchange rate). it was an enjoyable evening, but again we have equally as good restaurants at home and they are no where near as expensive (even those in Sydney and Melbourne).

The location was good, also. An easy walk to the heart of Waikiki and an easy walk to the Ala Moana shopping centre (though there weren't any shops there that you couldn't find on the main strip in Waikiki, so don't waste your time). Lots of eateries very close by and you are spoiled for choice.

While the service in general was good, it was nothing over and above what one would expect for the price tag that comes with the hotel. It would have been appreciated had the receptionist advised us at check in that they will ""hold"" the funds for the room from our credit card as well as extra for incidentals. On checking our credit card statement during our stay, we thought there had been fraudulent activity due to two very sizable amounts deducted, so we called home and had the card cancelled; only to find out it was the hotel. So thanks for that. It ended up costing us more due to cancelling our travel credit card and having to use another one. Not impressed.

Result - me in tears and our honeymoon cut short. We were not impressed and did not enjoy our stay as much as we thought we would. We ended up changing our flights and returned home early. We will not return to the Halekulani. In hindsight we should have left after the first day or so and gone next door to the Trump. 

My advice; if you are looking to treat yourself for a special occasion such as a honeymoon, then check out the Trump or the Moana Surfrider. Both looked amazing.","Date of stay: March 2015","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

My recommendations if you stay here - 
Utilise the concierge - if you outline things you want to do while on Oahu they will make solid recommendations and write up an itinerary for you which takes a lot of the pressure off you so you can enjoy your holiday. Easily the best concierge team I've ever dealt with.

The rooms were terribly out-dated and as soon as we pulled the sheets down there was hair ALL over!

They decided to tell us the gift certificate was our upgrade - thank GOODNESS we called our parents only to find out it was an addition.

That imposes certain limitations, including slow access from the airport because of godawful traffic on the H1, and smaller rooms, due to the astronomical value of beachfront property on Waikiki. However, they more than make up for it with the service. An individual escort takes you to your room, where you are greeted with half papayas and fresh bananas served on a tray with linen napkins and silverware. Our room (upgraded without request) looked out onto the ocean and was made more comfortable with the ocean breeze when we opened the doors to the lanai. Orchids Restaurant and House Without a Key are wonderful dining locations. When we arrive at this hotel after a long flight, we feel like we have come home. There is one sore spot: they have now coped off the patio where the small band plays Hawaiian music and the former Miss Hawaii dances the hula as it was meant to be danced. As a result, even if you just want to sit out and have drinks, you have to wait in the queue for House Without a Key, and our wait was over 30 minutes. A similar experience awaited us in the morning for breakfast, when the outside area was closed and tables were at at premium.

Upon entering the compound, you feel like you've escaped from the tourist crowd and can enjoy some tranquility.  In quintessential high-end Japanese-style hospitality (I've stayed in one for 6 straight months), the service is discreet, thoughtful and thoroughly professional. This extends to the tasteful white-shaded decor and lush-textured carpet, towels, sheets.

The concierge is exceptional.  Denise Mikado proposed an itinerary that catered to our family's interests and she followed through on ticket arrangements to the Polynesian Cultural Center; as well as a private tour to Pearl Harbor so that we could spend a whole Sunday there and still enjoy the not-to-be-missed brunch at Orchids.  The delicious brunch really lived up to expectations and fed us for the entire day.   Thankfully, the hotel provided complimentary yoga sessions, taught by one of the better hotel instructors I've encountered. 

Our only grievances were that the pool closed early at 6pm and the wait for a table at 'House without a Key' were unreasonably long, especially for hotel guests.

Yes the rooms deserve an update, but they are spotless and so comfortable it isn't really an issue. The view can make or break your experience. It is not inexpensive so if you get a city view, it can never be the same experience as an ocean view. Even if you do get the oceanfront view, the rooms are on the cozy side but the bathroom opens to the room through the closet and voila! you get to see Diamond Head right from the tub!
Sorry to say the toiletries while nicely packaged, are atrocious, scent and quality need to be upgraded theres no excuse. 
The chocolate box welcoming us was so exquisite that we bought two more. And we are enthusiasts when it comes to chocolates.
The breakfast buffet is very good, though it is incredibly busy. The servers are very experienced and keep the birds at bay, or they will jump on your table and eat your banana bread and whatever else you have unattended. The birds that is.
Dining is great, although tasting menus feel excruciatingly long if you're jet lagged. 
Yes, the front desk is a hit or miss. Not all associates are as friendly, and thats a fact.
The evening drinks with live Hawaiian music by the ocean is the best experience of all. Great Hawaiian music, not Hawaiian versions of pop songs you'd find elsewhere. Why would anybody travel thousands of miles to hear a Ukulele version of Rihanna! You are safe here at the Halekulani. And when you feel like shopping, the best of the best stores are right around the corner. 
A pointer, get your pool bed reserved before breakfast, no need to run down at 2 am, but bring your magazines and hat, put it on your favorite umbrella spot and chill.
The  spa is very small and has no wet area, sad. 
They have an old fashioned check out system, complete with a ""Cashier""

The service is like nothing else I have ever experienced and our love for this property is so great, that we have stayed here both times we've come to Hawaii. It is so luxurious and relaxing and every detail is just impeccable. I knew arriving at the hotel (the first time we had ever stayed) that it was going to be a different experience when we were whisked away to our rooms upon check in. This process happens in the privacy of your room and also gives the attendant the opportunity to make sure you are aware of the amenities that come with your room. Because my husband and I were still ""just engaged"" at the time of the visit, we were always addressed as ""Mr. M"" and ""Ms. D."" What's more impressive is that after we got married (during our second stay) we were immediately addressed as ""Mr. and Mrs. M."" Now THAT is attention to detail. The food is the best and freshest food that we have ever eaten at a hotel and - yes, this is biased - the food at our wedding reception, because it was prepared by the only hotel with the the only 5 star restaurant in the state of Hawaii, was the best dinner that our guests had ever had.

I'd heard this was one of the best in Honolulu.  Well, yes it is very nice, but not the best and not great.  In fact I was a little disappointed.  Unfortunately we got off to a rocky start.  

We arrived at the hotel just before 2 pm.  I had reserved a high floor ocean-front room.  After we arrived we were then told the room wasn't ready....but it would be ready shortly.  Okay I suppose it happens especially on a isolated, certainly not a holiday not too busy Thursday.   So we walked around, checked out the hotel,  went window shopping for while, killed an hour.  When we returned the room still wasn't ready.  I said to the front desk clerk with a swishy voice, c'mon what gives?   So the clerk thought he should remind me in his snooty feminine voice that they don't have to have room ready until 3pm.  That aggravated me.   So, I let him know that it seemed we're off to a bad start and I didn't appreciate his remark.  I wondered if maybe I would have to use my cell phone to see if the Sheraton Waikiki next door had availability.   

Apparently an assistant manager who must have overheard our conversation interceded and said they will be glad to put me on the 9th floor with an ocean view instead of the 14th.  Fine.  Let's do it.   We wanted to get settled already and get to the pool before sundown.  In January, it gets dark before 6pm.  We only had a couple of hours to get settled and get down to the pool.  

The room was very nice and did have a full ocean view which I'll admit was outstanding, but the room itself was rather small.  There was very little room to put two full sized suitcases, and even less room to pull out your clothes or where to put them.  So we just pulled out what we needed at the moment and left our clothes in our suitcases.   The bath area was very nice, stall shower and updated but that too seemed quite small. 

The other disappointment was the beach area.  It was dinky.  There was virtually no beach.  I did not like that.   The pool area itself is very nice.  However if you want some shade hotel guests need to grab chairs early, and the next morning we did, so that worked out.  As for the Hotel's restaurants,  we never ate breakfast at the hotel.  We saw no need to spend $100 for breakfast when Denny's was just outside the hotel.  

The Halekulani is a very nice city hotel, but certainly not worth what they charge.  I've stayed previously at the Kahala Resort just outside of Waikiki on a previous visit to Hawaii and now having stayed at both, the Kahala and Halekulani I believe Kahala is a much nicer hotel for the same money.  The one thing the Halekulani does have is a very good location for those who crave the hustle/ bustle of Honolulu and quick access to cities restaurant and nightlife scene.","Date of stay: January 2015","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

The service quality is superb (from the waitstaff to the valet), the breakfast buffet at the House Without a Key appeals to every type of eater, and the oceanfront rooms have beautiful views of the ocean.  
The Halekulani achieves part of its serenity by limiting rooms to no more than two guests.  A family of four would book two side-by-side rooms, which then can be closed off by a main door so that it's essentially a two bedroom suite.  
The pool, with the signature Halekulani orchid on the pool floor, is large and there is plenty of seating around the pool available.  The beach directly outside the Halekulani is a bit small, but since beaches are public in Hawaii, it takes only a short walk in either direction to find additional room.

We love Maui and visit there about once a year.  This time we decided to go to Oahu for a few days before heading to Maui.  Since it was to be our first time to stay on the island we decided to do the touristy thing and stay in the Waikiki area.  Having said that – we did not want a big crowded hotel so we opted for the Halekulani.

Our room was upgraded from a partial ocean view to an ocean view room.  The view from the room was of the rooms across from us (think of a ""U"" shaped hotel with the pool/gardens in the center) and to the right was the ocean.  The pool area is nice but nothing exceptional by any means.  The patio offered a great view of the ocean.  We had a trundle bed in our room for our daughter yet there was still ample space.  The bathroom was nicely sized with a full-sized tub and walk-in shower but only one sink.  The closet was able to be opened on both the bedroom and bathroom sides allowing you closet access from either room and a view out the window from the bathroom.

Upon walking into the room – the bathroom was to the right and there was a small entry space with a wet bar and refrigerator and then another set of doors that lead you into the bedroom.  It was nice having this extra set of doors to block out light and sound when we got up earlier than our daughter and wanted to start getting ready for the day.

The Halekulani is located towards the end of Waikiki beach.  As soon as you enter the hotel you are greeted with nothing but calm and tranquility.  The beach is very small and separated from the Sheraton Hotel beach by some rocks.  Most of the hotel patrons utilized the pool area.  

Some of the reviews talk about the hotel being dated.  It is an older hotel and it is a little on the dated side but only aesthetically speaking.  The rooms and hotel are kept very clean. However, it is the service and the friendliness of the staff that makes this hotel exceptional.  Everyone went above and beyond to make sure all of our needs were being met.  It is also just the small things they do such as on arrival they left a small bottle of sand with a note inside. The second night we received a blank notecard of an original watercolor of the hotel/pool area by Carli Oliver.  On our last night we received a small box with a shell inside and a sweet note.  

The ice bucket in your room is filled daily.  They also leave bottled water every day at no charge.
We were able to keep our bottled water and other drinks in the empty room refrigerator.  We were also given fresh robes daily.

We were there for my daughter’s birthday celebration.  I had prearranged a small gift to be waiting for her which they had nicely wrapped in a bag with a lot of pink tissue paper.  The Halekulani was nice enough to then provide on their own a large plate of assorted cookies and 3 big glasses of milk, a nice handwritten birthday note as well as an ice bucket filled with Perrier and bottled water.  We also received a welcome amenity gift consisting of a fruit plate and a small box of 4 assorted chocolates. 

Our room package included the breakfast buffet at the restaurant, House Without A Key.  It was very nice with a good selection of food including an egg/omelet bar.  The breakfast area is located oceanfront on the ground floor.

We ate dinner at House Without a Key one evening and it was an enjoyable experience.  It is a small menu but with many different offerings so something to please everyone.  The food was all fresh and good. 

They do offer valet parking but at a cost.  You pay $32 every day.  It is in the middle of a city so was not surprised at the cost.  The valet guys did a great job as we never once had to wait on the car.  They keep bottled water at their desk area and are happy to give them to you upon request when leaving or arriving the hotel.  They were also happy to let us take their beach towels with us at no charge when we went to the Sea Life Park to swim with the Dolphins.

My only (small) complaint about the hotel …. is that there is no lei greeting upon arrival.  We always love the tradition of being greeted with a flower lei (girls) and a kukui nut lei (guys).

While we prefer a more quiet and less crowded environment than Waikiki ….. I would happily stay at the Halekulani again.  It is the service and friendliness of this hotel that sold us.

I gave the hotel 4 stars versus 5 because of its location being in Waikiki, the hotel a little on the dated side and the pool area being nothing spectacular.  The friendliness, helpfulness and attention to detail by the staff is what makes this hotel.","Date of stay: January 2015","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

The halekulani was a great experience, sleek lines, beautiful landscaping, inviting pool, and lovely rooms with a large bathroom. I especially appreciated the pool staff who cleared out lounges after guests who grabbed a chair at dawn and expected exclusive use until dark whether they ever actually appeared or not. Overall the customer service was impeccable and not obsequious. Proximity to Roy's and Nobu also provided great lunch options, in addition to the food trucks, a couple of blocks away.","Date of stay: January 2015","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Our room was spacious, clean and provided an ocen view which was great.  Turn down service is a plus.

Our room wasn't available until check-in time which we understand is sometimes beyound the control of the hotel.  We also had a couple minor issues with the room when we checked in but we mentioned them to the front desk before going to dinner and they were all taken care of when we returned to our room.  Nice!

Because there are so many restaurant options in Waikiki we did not try any of the restaurants in the hotel so I can't speak to them.  Our interactions with staff were limited to the front desk, concierge and pool/beach crews.  The first two groups were super but the pool/beach staff not so much.  They were not rude just somewhat indifferent.  But that was such a minor part of the experience; who cares.

All in all, a great property at a fair resort price for Waikiki.","Date of stay: January 2015","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Rooms have not changed at all but rooms are very clean and well taken care of.  The beds are very comfortable.  The bathrooms a nice size.  Wish they had two sinks but still are very nice.  The hotel is not as quiet as it has been in the past.  There is road construction going on right next to the hotel.  We ordered a diamondhead ocean front but it was noisy from the hotel next stor as there is a parking lot and at 4:00 am a car was blowing it horn every couple of minutes.  Not the fault of the hotel.  We asked to be in the main building and they were very accommodating and moved us to an Ocean Front in the center.  This was much quieter.  The grounds are beautiful.  There is a small beach but plenty of ocean to swim.  There is security right at the gate so folks not staying at the hotel cannot come in.  One security person named Steven was great.  It was high tide and high surf warning and he was really concerned about some older folks who were going in the water.  He was prepared to help if they got into trouble.  There are many hotels in this area but none are as good.  It is within walking distance of many places to eat and shop.  There is a very good spa at the hotel.

Come to the overpriced Halekulani if you want a Dr. Who experience,,.....the whole place is locked somewhere in the mid 1980's, the shower cubicles in the hotel rooms are, unlike the Tardis, actually smaller than they appear and you can bang various body parts as you attempt to shower, and in a further Dr.Who analogy, if you want to meet aliens from distant planets, just go onto your balcony and be hailed by fellow residents of this establishment. Go lie by the pool, and join the sardines in a can. Not the place to go in cognito or to attempt a weekend assignation. All too cheek by jowl. The House Without A Key is another 'pack 'em in' experience, so if you are after sophisticated cocktails as the sun sets, forget it. 

While the property can't do much in the short term or even long term regarding location or geographical orientation, it can plan to bring the property into the 21st century. It is soooo locked in the 80's.

There is nothing much wrong with the staff (over attentive, over manned, over uniformed?) but the product of the Halekulani is confused. 

Do we want a blizzard of tent cards in our rooms? Do I really want a 'gift' of a conch shell? No, I'd like a plate to put the remnants of the fruit basket on! Do I want an invitation to tomorrow night's 'Manager's Cocktail' when I will have already left the country!? What?

So what is the Halekulani product or more correctly the Halekulani target market? Over-wintering US widows, Japanese families, Australian shoppers? I don't know and the hotel certainly doesn't. I do know it isn't for me.

In three cab rides to the hotel, on hearing 'Halekulani' , all three drivers responded, unprompted, ' ah, the most expensive hotel in Honolulu'. True. Worth it? definitely not.

In defence of the hotel, they did respond to concerns by putting up the restaurant manager to hear our views, writing off the meal cost, following up with a phone call at 9.30 at night, but this doesn't resolve the basic issue that at over $700 a night, this is at best, a three star experience. Food quality was at best average and to serve bland stodgy bowls of rice with main courses again talks to the questions as to whom The Halekulai thinks it is catering.

In The Orchids restaurant, when at 15 tables, some with up to 8 guests per table, no-one is actually eating and several have taken to their I-phones, the take-away impression has to be that is isn't the greatest culinary experience in the world.

A final gripe, if you want to make a dinner reservation, just dial the appropriate button from your room. You can listen to 'Muzak' for 15 minutes and get nowhere. This doesn't matter as preferred outside dining tables are on a first come first served basis so don't bother booking! This is what you get at $700 a night.

Before Christmas we stayed at The Modern hotel, down the road. We know where we'll stay when next in Hawaii.

We leave tomorrow. Can't wait for Dr. Who to transport us out of here.","Date of stay: January 2015","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_20"

Being our first visit to Hawaii to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary, we chose the Halekulani on reputation alone and it lived up to that and beyond.  An all night flight from Australia saw us arrive exhausted and beyond tired.  We were there too early, before our room was due to be ready.  They quickly booked us in and showed us to a guest lounge where we could freshen up and take refreshments.  However, we eventually returned to the foyer to wait.  The reception area is the only area of this hotel complex which needs a revamp with some customer friendly lounges as the chairs are wooden and peculiarly placed in corners and having people, like me, asleep on them is not a good look!  As for our room, it was beautiful, it took my breath away.  I can't imagine why people have complaints about them to be honest.  Large with king sized bed and lounge area, decorated in cool, relaxing colours with a deck that looked out over a divine scene of ocean, beach and down to the restaurant and pool was amazing. The bathroom was equally large with separate bath and shower and private toilet area.  I could have lived there. The wifi was free, quick and strong - a nice bonus for people away from home to stay in touch. The pool area was gorgeous and the attendants, particularly those serving food and drinks, were attentive and friendly. House Without a Key restaurant's breakfast was enjoyable, if a bit same-ish, each day.  However, I would recommend the omelettes to you and the waffles!  We also ate here at night on a couple of occasions over the week.  The waiters were wonderful (particular thanks to Ian) and we enjoyed the Hawaiian live music each night.  I did laugh thinking they looked like a group of orthodontists  though - I might get rid of the white uniform and don something a bit more Hawaiian? The criticism by some people here of the small beach is a little unfair as huge storms regularly change the face of many beaches and to be honest, Waikiki has any number of beaches, large and small that are worth visiting. The Halekulani felt exclusive because the general hordes can't drift through it so, as a result, we felt pampered and cared for, the reason we had booked in the first place.  Yes, we did have an ocean front room on a high floor which was divine but most other rooms looked similar and as Waikiki has so much to offer, we spent only minimal time in it. We hired a car from the concierge desk at a competitive price which then gave us access to Halekulani's parking for free, quite a bonus. The hotel is positioned wonderfully for shopping, easy walking to the Hilton's fireworks display and different catamaran trips as well as a myriad of other things. We loved, loved, loved this hotel.  I would be a picky person indeed to find fault with it at all.  I will be back, that is for certain, one of these days.

The staff are excellent and service is top line which is what you would expect from an expensive classic hotel.

Our family spent 5 days here shopping, sightseeing and enjoying the beach ambience.

In the hotel we dined almost exclusively at House Without a Key which is the main breakfast and afternoon drinks area. There are a few other more ritzy restaurants but we didn't sample them, instead choosing to dine a fair bit in the many nearby restaurants - Nobu is literally across the road.

A measure of service is not so much having no problems (although that is great) but how you handle them. The concierge (to put it simply) stuffed a sail/snorkel booking to the effect we were left on the other side of Oahu looking at a boat that was not what we had asked for. We chose to return by taxi and after a brief (and out of character) attempt to sheet the problem to us the concierge realised their mistake and went into severe overdrive on trying to fix things including picking up the fee on the wrong booking, the cab fare back and the fee on an alternate booking they arranged at short notice. Frankly it wasn't the money that mattered but it helped that there was no argument about picking it up and that they genuinely did their best to resolve the problem.

To their credit (no pun intended - well maybe) the hotel also advised me not to use my travel card when I checked in which saved me a mountain of grief.

The beach in front off the hotel is a postage stamp but served its purpose for our girls and Waikiki was a great spot for them to have some surf lessons. The shopping was extreme.","Date of stay: October 2014","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Check in at the front desk was confusing.  Lady on computer was talking to us while a different lady was trying to take us to our room, so I really didn't catch what the lady behind the computer was telling us. But Sue personally escorted us around the hotel and to our room.  She was very thorough. The room was nice but needs updating. And the beds were way too soft.  Free wifi included.  The evening hula show is a must. Service was kinda slow during the show though. Room service was excellent.  Pool area was nice; pool service did not begin until 11am. Orchids was great. The hospitality suite is available for guests who's room is not ready yet or if you would like to hang out beyond check out time. It's an area with couches, newspapers, TVs, and 2 individual unisex bathrooms that also have a shower in each. Overall a great hotel, but not the best.

Was also disappointed that there wasn't a hot tub on the property and the pool wasn't that spectacular.  However, many positives which outweighed the negatives for me.  The buffet breakfast selection was outstanding with lots of fresh, diverse options. The restaurant was near the ocean, so tropical breezes wafted through.  Staff was both impeccably professional and genuinely warm. Rooms felt ""new"". They provided free wifi, bottled waters and fresh fruit so I never felt nickel-and-dimed.  Proximity to a small SANDY beach was awesome - look at the hotel from Google earth and you'll see that the Halekulani has a unique sandy stretch of ocean as opposed to the rocky coral floors of adjacent properties.  Loved that in the hotel's backyard you could walk into the ocean and enjoy nature, and steps away from its front is a slew of stores and restaurants on Lewers and Beachwalk.  I enjoyed the upbeat Honolulu city vibe. Walking from Roy's (outstanding) to Brandy Melville (my tween's fave store), Lucky Brand store and the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center nearby - so much eye candy to look at whether you are willing to $$pend, or window shop or just enjoy a night stroll.

I was not disappointed!  I read previous reviews of unpleasant check in experiences, and I'm happy to say my husband and I experienced a quick and professional check-in and had a charming gentleman show us around the property, at great length, and escorted us to our room and made sure that everything was acceptable.  It certainly was and then some!  We had an awesome view, one room in from full ocean front, and the room was tastefully decorated.  I liked the closet, which had doors that slid open on both the front and back side so if you were in the bathroom and wanted an ocean view, you could just open up both closet doors.  The daily maid service was excellent, with the ice bucket being refilled daily as a matter of course.  How nice to not have to go through the hassle of calling for ice when you need it.  We enjoyed the evening entertainment at House without a Key, had the superb Sunday buffet brunch in Orchids and spent some enjoyable hours around the pool.  There is a very convenient ABC store close to the hotel which had everything anyone could need and we supplemented our dining a couple of times with great food from there.  Check it out if you need a break from the hotel dining experience.  One morning we had a very early pickup for a Pearl Harbor tour, so we had room service breakfast which was very good and delivered on time and hot!  Every time I called either room service or the concierge desk, I was addressed by name and the people seemed genuinely happy to accomplish whatever my request was.

On walking in, there is almost a peaceful serene atmosphere to the place and you can’t help but feel at ease.  Check in is very welcoming and takes place in your room.  You can opt for a little tour of the hotel on your way should you wish which helps you get your bearings. 

We had a Diamond Head room which had a lovely view but although a little fancy tech-wise, felt old and a bit tired.  Like me.  And there were no coffee or tea-making facilities in the room either which was, erm... different.  The bath was a bit grubby but the rest was clean and nicely laid out with shutters that open to the room and therefore the view. 

Dinner was out at Alan Wongs, but we stopped by House Without a Key before leaving and was told there were no seats for us just yet.  So we contemplated leaving for a walk on the beach when we were promptly taken to two seats right near that night's performance which was lovely.  However, on looking around there were plenty of other seats so not sure what was happening there.  After dinner we stopped by Lewers Lounge which had fabulous music by Noly Paa in a truly relaxing atmosphere with delicious libations and desserts.  It was an enchanting evening.

We had to leave at 6am the next day so room service kindly put together a very early morning breakfast which we had booked the night before. It was good and on-time for delivery. 

All of the people at Halekulani are great (especially concierge, valet and check-in) and the hotel is located brilliantly for shops.  We will likely be back one day.","Date of stay: November 2014","Trip type: Traveled on business","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

We usually don’t ever order room service and generally always prefer to dine at restaurants, but we made an exception at the Halekulani and ordered-in breakfast because of the beautiful view from our balcony and it was absolutely amazing! Actually, the entire food and beverage division at the Halekulani provided beautiful, memorable dining experiences for us. We had meals at La Mer, Orchids and House without a Key, in addition to our room service breakfast, and every meal was truly outstanding, with wonderful food and incredible staff / service. 

The valets, doormen and porters at the hotel were also top-notch, very professional, well organized, courteous and beyond helpful, a 10/10 team. 

The one hotel area we had problems with was the front desk (I don’t want to go into detail here as we already provided our feedback to the hotel directly) and it is a shame to see how such a key division at an otherwise exceptionally well-run hotel seems to be so poorly managed. During the lengthy and most unprofessional check-in process we ever had to endure, we actually considered  NOT sticking it out and move to another hotel instead, but in the end we were glad we stayed as everything else at the Halekulani was definitely top-hotel standard. So, if you should have a similar check-in experience as we did, just hang in there, you won’t regret it (and had it not been for the front desk, this would have been a 5 star review).","Date of stay: October 2014","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

The rooms were larger than I was expecting and well appointed. I would call the decor classic hawaiian with the white timber shutters. We had a room on the lower ground floor and this was perfect for a small baby with easy access to the pool and the ocean. At previous hotels we have had ocean views but I would take the ground floor any day with smaller children to be nearer to the pool/beach.

We had breakfast everyday and found it really great having a little one. I know several people complained about wait times but we never experienced it, only having to wait 5 to 2 mins. All the staff are really friendly and welcoming. 

We stayed 7 nights, this is a perfect amount of time in Waikiki and then 5 nights on the big island. The pool was gorgeous and the grounds well maintained.  

Bottled water and ice was delivered when we wanted, great housekeeping service and turn down. 

I really like the position of this hotel. I think it's worth it to pay a little more when you have a young family to be closer to the beach if you enjoy going to the beach/pool.  Also it does pay to get breakfast included as I have stayed at a few properties without breakfast and unless you like Denny's or Eggs and things (sometimes a 1hour wait) it's hard to find easy and convenient breakfast places.","Date of stay: November 2014","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Often when you asked for something to be done the staff member would think of a way to make it even more special. So when I asked the concierge if they could help me post a present to my niece in England, they didn't just carry out instructions but came up with the idea of wrapping the gifts in special halekulani paper to make it an even nicer thing to receive. If we were looking to take a selfie, a staff member would often volunteer to take the shot for us so that it would turn out better. There are so many more instances that I could give of the staff here over delivering in their service.

I also agree with the past reviews getting breakfast vouchers and having to line up for 40min to eat, we had to cross the road to get breakfast. The pool is very run down with very old pool chairs, not what you would expect for such an expensive hotel. Rooms were run down but clean and staff very nice. Also had to pay a holding deposit when checking in of $7000 and still they have not released it two weeks later, as to date many emails later and still no reply.

We requested early check in; however, it turned out it was not available.  Although the hotel has a room on the second floor in which people can wait comfortably for their room, that room was apparently ""full,"" so we had to wait elsewhere, which meant lunch in their House With No Key restaurant overloooking the ocean, which was fine with us.  After lunch, the waiting room had sufficient space for them to allow us to wait there until our room became available, which suddenly it did.  We were shown to our room by Carol, which was a very nice touch, and she explained all of the room's features to us quite thoroughly.  The room was very nice, and the bathroom was perfect, having a shower separate from the tub, and a separate closet for the toilet.  The bathroom had  louvered doors opening into the closet, and the closet also had louvered doors on the other side opening into the bedroom.  The toiletries were complete and of very nice quality.  The bedroom had two twin beds in it which were a placed right next to one another (too close) without the space one would expect. The ""ocean view"" room, which was not ""ocean front,"" had an acceptable view.  There was a very large balcony overlooking the pool, from which one could enjoy a view of the pool, ocean, departing catamarans, and, more intrusively, the Sheraton Waikiki tower looming up several stories into the sky right next door.  We could not see Diamond Head because of the Sheraton, but we could see Diamond Head point.  The view was fine, but definitely not overwhelming.  The beds were on the north side of the room so that one could make the most of the view while in the beds, which I thought was good.  We used laundry service and it was excellent, our clothing being brought back by the next evening.  Laundry prices were what one would expect, but not excessive.  Very much enjoyed our meals at the House With No Key, and also at Orchids.  From the hotel we could easily walk next door to the Sheraton and the Royal Hawaiian, which was most convenient.  Also, it was wonderful to simply head downstairs to hear the evening hula and Hawaiian music show under the century old Kiawe tree overlooking the ocean.  It really doesn't get much better than this.  Delicious mai tais too.","Date of stay: September 2014","Trip type: Traveled with friends","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The staff we encounterd over that time were really friendly and helpful. A special mention to our server at breakfast Terri  ( A House without a Key)a most gracious lady!!!! The system with breakfast vouchers is absolutely ridiculous, we only stay in five star hotels and have never seen anything like it? Surely there s a better way, staying in a $2,000 suite per day you would think there would be a advanced system than a degrading two star hotel voucher!!!?????? Also to line up for 20 minutes at 7.30am to get a table, insane!!!

If you are after a beach front, don't bother. The small area that you have in front of the hotel is only accessible from a side gate, and frankly not worth the trip. You have literally thousands of people walking pass each day, as I stood up from lounge chair I had a guy asking what hotel is it???? The pool was good, no problem getting a chair and the pool attendants were excellent. If you have kids who want to throw a beach ball in the pool forget it, they will be stopped!!!!

We decided one night to have dessert back at A House Without a Key after being at another restaurant for dinner. My husband and daughter wanted only ice cream. Well when they got their bowls they look like they had scraped the bottom of the barrel, they weren't even formed ice cream balls!!! Very amateur, hence we never had dessert again. If you can't get ice cream right?!?

Upon check in, a senior staff showed us around the hotel restaurant and the facilities up to our room with detail explanation
Our room was the ocean front room and to our liking we got the highest end with perfect view of waikiki beach, love it
We only mentioned our honeymoon once to one of the staff during our check in but it seems that everyone working there knows it, oh well it cliche perhaps it doesn't really matter but we appreciate it and made us feel as in important guess for they gesture, sending us champagne to celebrate. 
And we noticed it because they help us booking our dinner at Roy's, Top of Waikiki, and Azure restaurant at Royal Hawaiian and it stated that we are their guest on honeymoon
I think all these little details what makes them an absolute great hotel for years
They ensured that we enjoyed our stay by catering to all our requests
The concierge is very good and proffesional, they help us alot with tour, restaurant booking even any inquiries in regards of hawaii
They have very busy restaurant that show live band almost every sunset i guess.. Cant remember but the hawaiian dancer are those beautiful ladies and miss usa or something, they are really gorgeous performance
I like the garden and hotel building, somehow the middle garden reminds me abit of Raffles hotel Singapore, white building with greens
Breakfast is sufficient and good, we also tried some of their cocktail, mai tai one of them

My husband and I stayed one night before heading to Maui. The grounds are beautiful and well kept and the service was friendly and genuine. The rooms are in need of updating--nothing spectacular or five star about them. They had some cool technological amenities but overall the furniture and decor was dated and in need of an update. The pool was also small and didn't have much of a ""scene""--service was sporadic but friendly. We loved our dinner at Orchids--food and service was wonderful!

In Honolulu we were surprised that the tourists were primarily Japanese, this hotel has around 75-80% Japanese with the rest being mainly Australians and British. This meant that the dynamics were more towards an Asian twist which for us was ok.

The hotel is all about quality, from arrival to departure you are treated in a very respectful and positive way, all staff smile and genuinely want you to enjoy your stay. We stayed in room 1241 which had a really nice ocean view, the room was kept clean and tidy by our room maids and the turn down service was also first class, each night a small gift was left on our pillows and our fridge was topped up with bottled water.

Another real positive is the breakfast and the wonderful Melissa, she is the breakfast host and is a real ambassador to the hotel, every morning she remembered our name and we also noticed that she seemed to remember ever guests name! A real superstar.

The breakfast was excellent, a full buffet catering for all nationalities with a omelette / egg station, we were also impressed with the fresh fruit and berries.

One thing not to miss is the band and dancer at 6pm in the bar area, have cocktails watching the sun set is our recommendation, the cocktails are great, the band excellent and the dancer classy.

We also booked our tours with Wendy Wong the concierge, she organised our helicopter and also pearl harbour tour.

The staff here are very professional but on the formal side. We traveled with my 7 year son and had a wonderful time. The.concierge was able to find a baby sitter in short notice during dinner time.

Imagine our disappointment at reception to be told there was a problem, and an invitation to meet the duty manager !  Never a good sign. However, regardless of the reason behind the apparent issue, we were offered an alternate stay at the Halekulani Hotel across the street? Had we heard of it we were asked ? Boy, had we !! An escorted introduction by the Waikiki Parc DM and handover to lead concierge Paul, resulted in a wonderful start to our stay at a quality establishment. 

Apology letters for inconvenience, daily chocolates and treats, made us feel very privileged to experience luxury and high service levels. It set the benchmark for our 2 week holiday in Hawaii and it was not surpassed during the balance of our trip.

The king sized room was extremely well appointed with luxurious pillows and a large marble bathroom. 

DO have cocktails at sunset in the beach front setting, DO enjoy the live entertainment and DO follow up with dinner at the on-site restaurant. It was romantic, special and pperrsonalised.

Thank you to the staff and managers for creating a special and memorable stay.","Date of stay: December 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

What a great choice.

The room is great and over-sized.  I paid to have a Diamondhead view and it is worth every dollar.  I could spend forever looking out on the terrace.  Bed is super comfortable and the room has a sofa and sitting area.  Nice desk with terrace view and great free Internet (using it now as I do everyday for a couple of hours of work).  Bathroom is oversized with tub, shower, sink with chair in front of it, lots of counter room for personal toiletries and a seperate stall with the toilet.  The closet, which is ample, opens both to the bathroom and bedroom.  Small entry with refrigerator always stocked with free bottled water.  Nice amenities, not over the top, but normal.  Free gift each night which is quite a nice touch.  Maid service and turndown.   

When we arrived on light bulb was out but it was replaced the next day.  Odd light under the night stand and my spouse was not paying attention when reception clerk (you check in in your room) pointed it out to us as I had to show how to turn it off.  Smart to show how to do it as it is not evident.

Great restaurants (other than Nobu which has awful service) - see my reviews on each.

Property is lovely, pool is great and very nice.  Beach area is small but a quick walk away and you are at a better beach where you can rent an umbrella and chairs.   

Terrific staff overall.  I disagree with reviews saying they remember your name.  No one remembered us but all were super polite and friendly and greeted us.

Great spa.

My sole disappointment was concierge.  (1) Friends sent us a bottle of champagne and the card was filled out wrong with the message of the card repeated where the names should be.  I called room service who said concierge filled out the card wrong and the room service attendant told me who sent us the lovely gesture.  (2) Concierge booked us at Nobu inside the hotel's sister property and we were mistreated.  As there always seem to be people at the concierge desk, I sent an email to David Nakamura (he reached out to me prior to visit to offer any help needed) and the generic concierge email address.   I did this on Sunday night and now it is Friday morning - still no courtesy of a reply.  I used Opentable.com to book other dinners as I realized that the concierge management is not on par with the rest of the Halekulani - no other issues.  I suggest not using concierge service.  They have no skills and do not care.

Other oddity is when trash is in hallway near room (shopping bags), it is left for the morning maid even if the evening maid (male) is doing the turndown services.   Looks terrible and should be removed faster as is the case in every NYC hotel (another shopping paradise) I go to.   Otherwise, A++ for housekeeping.

Overall great hotel, great stay, all you meet in stores advise you it is the best hotel in town, great location.  If you can avoid the concierge, all will go well.","Date of stay: August 2014","Trip type: Traveled on business","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The experience was superb.  Service was top-level everywhere - friendly valets who remember your name and greet you with smiles, efficient front desk, extremely friendly housekeeping, high level of service by waiters/waitresses (Room with a Key, Orchids, and especially La Mer).

Rooms were spacious and layout was good.  The hotel is not new, and you can tell, but the rooms are clean and maintained very well.  Beds are comfortable and bathroom lay out is good (shower stall is on the small side).

We had ocean view rooms - while you can see the ocean, you need to look at an angle - if you can, try to get ocean front - I think the experience will be even better.  

Pool was nice - water temperature not too cold nor warm.  If you want good seats by the pool with shade, go early to reserve your space (perhaps 6am - staff are there from 4am).

One thing that can be improved is the wi-fi - it is rather slow and connections weak in some areas.

My family made our annual visit to this ""Heaven On Earth"" during Hurricane Iselle.  Setting aside the usual accolades and superlatives one would usually bestow on this property's amazing service and attentiveness, we were absolutely amazed at the level of preparation the hotel went through to ensure guests' experience is not disrupted.  Here are the specifics.

1. Check-in / Valet.  One of the most amazing things about this place is that each and every time we have been here, the bags would show up at precisely the same time we are escorted to our room(s).  BTW, check-in is conducted in the rooms, not at the front-desk.  What a civilized way of welcoming people to such a wonderful place.

2. Meals. Morning breakfasts are served at House Without A Key (buffet) or Orchid (full-service menu) daily.  The kids prefer buffet so we have gotten to know some of the staff pretty well over the years.  One of their team members even gave us her cell and home phone, offering to host us if we are stranded by the Hurricane later that week.  Such encounter is but one of the many similar personable experiences we have shared with their staff over the last 20+ years.

3. Housekeeping.  One of the most amazing things about this place is that somehow, housekeeping always manages to complete their duties during the time we are out of the room, no matter the length of our absence.  Moreover, the incredible mess our teenagers created in their room is always straightened out daily.  This is by far the hardest working group of employees I have run across from my 3+ million miles of travels.

4. Amenities.  Though the hotel is quite pricey, many amenities are included.  For example, the hotel offers free access to many museums in town (e.g. the Iolani Palace guided tour alone would run us in excess of $100).  The exercise room also offers bananas, fruits, and bottled water.  Oh, did I mention the great ocean view directly in front of the elliptical and treadmill machines?  

They also offer free yoga and other exercise classes daily on the property.

Concierge consists of a group of super friendly and knowledgeable folks who can give you the inside scoops on whatever/wherever you need to visit on Oahu.  We wanted to try a hike this time and they went out of their way to print direction for us, but to also check the weather to ascertain how muddy the hike would be.  

5. Misc.  Lastly, the hotel invites all guests to a manager's reception each Wednesday evening.  Though the food is okay, consisting of mostly small bites, they do have a complementary open bar as well as a dozen or so roaming staffs taking drink orders.  It is a great opportunity to meet some of their management staff.  A not to miss event at this hotel.

Overall, this is a perfect 10 stay.  I would rate this property over that of Maui Four Seasons, Grand Wailea, and Kapalua's Ritz (all properties I have visited).","Date of stay: August 2014","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

If you can afford the ocean view room I highly recommend it. Walking into our room and seeing that view was breathtaking. 
The breakfast was probably a 7/10 but the thing I loved most about this hotel was being able to go shopping or sightseeing all day and coming home to see the live band they have playing. The Hawaiian music was so beautiful and just sitting back and relaxing enjoying a cocktail was fantastic. I did visit a few other hotels but the music didn't compare. 
If you get a chance to have dinner in their restaurant doooo it!!! Absolutely delicious. (La mer) Book in advance and ask for a balcony table so u can enjoy the view. The staff are extremely attentive and the food is lovely. They were ok with me changing the dish slightly to fit my tastes as well. 
The atmosphere is relaxing and the spa was nice but a bit pricey. A couple massage and a wash n blow dry was like $600. I'm from sydney and I could get the same thing for $250. But if u want that massage in hawaii it's $$.

The pool is beautiful, however wake up early and reserve a seat so u can sun bake later. Put a towel on the seat to reserve it. You can bring blow up devices to the pool too- sold at the abc store. This is a lot of fun 
They even have their own private beach which isn't crowded and it's nice for families. 
If your interested in seeing the Fire works don't stand in front of the private beach you won't see anything. Get the boat that leaves from in front of the hotel(private beach area) there are two to choose from and these will allow you to get a fantastic view of the fireworks on the Friday night. 
Bit of a warning though, the mai tais taste amazing but they area deadly !!!! I can usually drink quite a bit and four drinks knocked me out!

Perhaps this was the case many years ago but the hotel definitely not moved forward with the times. It would rank very poorly against other high quality hotels throughout the world charging similar rates.

Resort atmosphere is old world and boring. Its main clientele is a much older demographic that have clearly been repeatedly going for many many years. Unless the hotel does something to modernise it will end up being a retirement village style resort - they need to appeal to a new demographic !!

The room rate would imply a very different impression from the reality. The quality of the product is significantly lower than ShangriLa, Park Hyatt, Four Seasons, W, Andaz or other leading international hotel brands that have kept up to date with times. Whilst the choice on waikiki is limited, I still don't think the product is worth the rate.

Staff are very friendly and attentive. They do try very hard. However, for a hotel of this supposed quality, their job is made difficult by a lack of staff in total and the physical facilities they have to work with. This can give the impression of a lack of service - but it is clearly not the staff who are at fault, rather the management and their clear cost cutting approach.

For example, the breakfast buffet is appalling for a hotel of this standard. On the positive, the staff are extremely friendly and attentive. The egg chef is a gem and eager to do anything you want. On the negative side the actual buffet is tiny, the variety of choice is poor and aa 3* hotel in southern Europe would be much better. The speed of which they replace the finished food is pathetic. Hotel management would benefit by going to Singapore or Hong Kong and seeing how its done there. 

Also on the negative is the limited serving staff they have on hand. This means that despite having the extra tables, hotel guests are made to wait 15-20min for table, at busy times, because the hotel do not employ enough staff at these times - This is appalling for hotel charging these rates and holding themselves out as a luxury 5* facility.

We stayed in an Ocean View King Room. The room is decent in size however it lacks the modern touch, particularly in the bathrooms. Cupboard space is poor. A/C is not great. Rooms are clean but not worth the premium price.

The pool area is ok compared to other pool on waikiki (although Sheraton probably the best). The pool staff are very helpful. However take your flip flops as the floor tiles are granite and are boiling hot - not much thought went into the design of this !!

The location is good - it is not really on the main beach itself and perhaps the Sheraton, Royal Hawaiin, Moana Surfrider or Outrigger are better located from that perspective. It is however well located for the shopping.

All in all, I have stayed at much better and for similar or less $$. I probably would not return unless it was much cheaper and priced relative to what it actually provides. Given the lack of great quality in Waikiki, next time I probably would take a better quality room at Outrigger (Ocean Front Suite) or Moana Surf Rider - better value for money and better located for the beach.","Date of stay: July 2014","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

We LOVED our week there so much that we cancelled the second hotel we had booked for our second week's stay after three days on the Big Island, and reserved another seven nights at Halekulani - a decision we did not regret. 

Halekulani's rooms are beautifully and stylishly configured, spotlessly clean and serviced. Our balcony was spacious and faced the ocean. Super comfortable bedding, soft and luxurious towels. Beautiful gifts left every evening at turn-down - such a lovely touch. Wonderful!! 

The staff are terrific - so polite and friendly, and so eager to help and make you feel welcomed. Breakfast and meal staff, welcome and bell staff, house-keeping staff, poolside staff and the concierges were all fabulous, as were the managers.

The pool is gorgeous - and right on the beach, so you can easily pop out the hotel gate to have a dip in the sea. The pool lounges were very comfortable, with nice big towels; poolside bar and food service always available. Very clean. Convenient bathrooms close by. Nice and quiet - no screaming guests, thank goodness. ""Quietness"" is part of the hotel policy - loved it!! Also, you do not have to pay an extra fee for the pool lounges, as you do in some of the hotels. You do need to get there early to reserve your chosen positions though...just inform the pool staff and leave a book/hat as a mark of your reservation, before you go off to breakfast.

The buffet breakfast at House Without A key is very satisfying, with the most delicious smoked salmon I think I have ever tasted; however, if you have breakfasted in Thailand or Bali 5 star hotels, you might be a little disappointed, as we were. Don't get me wrong - the breakfast choices were delicious, but there was not as much variety as you would enjoy if you were in 5 star Asian hotels. There was no fresh cheese platter; no curries or fried rice; the egg chef could not make a good omelette (over-cooked and dry); no large toaster to crisp up pastries. On the up side, stunning berries and fruits were available every day, as were pancakes, sausages, bacon and all the usual fare, including some Japanese options (but no sushi). 

The lunch and dinner meals were very good, but again, not a great deal of variety. The BBQ night was a little disappointing, but the staff and entertainment made up for it. There is wonderful music, singing and hula dancing every evening. 

One thing that did bother us though was that there is no in-room coffee making facility - at all. So to get your coffee first thing in the morning before you get ready to go downstairs for breakfast, you have to either go downstairs yourself to collect some free coffee and then bring it back upstairs to your room, or order room service - $20+ for a pot of four cups!! We have never encountered this.

Many of the guests are Japanese - what a joy to see so many beautiful Japanese brides and handsome grooms celebrating their weddings! What a bonus!! Loved it!!!

There are lovely boutique shops to enjoy, and a fantastic Manager's Cocktail Evening on Wednesday evenings - this was especially generous and impressive!

Halekulani is so well located - walking distance to almost everything you need, and as I have already mentioned, right on the beach. Excellent!!!

Halekulani is not cheap - but you get what you pay for - HEAVEN!!!! Thank you, Halekulani, for making our stay in Waikiki so memorable!!","Date of stay: June 2014","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The views from the front area are just perfect.,the entertainment adds to it all.
The enchanting swimming pool is perfect

Sadly this will be my last time. I will probably go next to the Kahala Mandarin. The service is still great and are very attentive and the food is quite adequate. But the clientele of this resort has changed dramatically over the past years. While I am still here for another day, I had to retreat to my room lanai for my third day in a row to read because the pool has become a children's playground. The pool is filled with crying, laughing, screaming infants, toddlers and small kids with their inner tubes, floaties, and water wings. I'm talking 30 kids right now with their doting parents. Right next to me, a parent was holding his baby boy in the water and bouncing around - got out and went to the bathroom and changed the poopy diaper- then went back to the chaise lounge where the wife was waiting with a fresh diaper. And I am expected to swim in this famous pool!!! It just isn't a peaceful place anymore. For some reason, it has gotten away from a stylish couples and upscale single hotel that always had the ""old"" Hawaii mixed in. (Along with some fairly refined families), is now become young couples with tattoos and wife beater tee-shirts, and children! The hotel would do right to consider a kiddie pool somewhere on the property or have a membership with a club for families with small kids. 
Also, I am here for 5 nights and I was put in a room with a handicapped bathroom with pipes all over the place and a shower that you literally had to climb into. I have stayed in some gorgeous rooms here before. - but this one is not great- carpet stained too.","Date of stay: July 2014","Trip type: Traveled solo","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

From the moment we arrived we were met by attentive bell staff who looked after all our luggage. We were made so welcome at reception and guided around the resort and to our room by Mark who did check in formalities in our room. This was a nice personal touch.

The lobby area was spacious and never busy and the vibe of the Halekalani was elegant yet sophisticated at the same time.  

Free Wi-Fi through the hotel is great but not available in the lobby area.

Our beautiful room was on the 3rd floor with a direct ocean view and pool view.
We had a double double ocean view room as we were traveling with our 18 year old daughter and the room was spacious and very comfortable. We liked the couch and sitting area as well as the efficient use of draws for storage of clothes. The wardrobe was interesting as both sides slide open so you have a view from the bathroom to the ocean.

It is nice to stay in hotel rooms that have plenty of space and this one had a huge lanai (balcony) to have breakfast, a cup tea or just relax on. While the rooms do not have a boiler/ kettle, you just call and one is delivered to your room.

The bathroom was very spacious with separate toilet, shower and bath tub. 

Reflecting on our stay it was hard to fault this hotel. The staff are wonderful, obliging and very welcoming.  The pool staff were always happy to assist from setting up the lounges, supplying towels and always asking if we need drinks or food around the pool.

We loved the gardens and pool area of the hotel and felt like we were at our very own little oasis. Although people walk past the pool along a beach pathway, you are not disturbed and the noise levels by the pool are low as no loud music is played.

Concierge staff were helpful and housekeeping staff efficient who placed in the room fresh water and a small gift when they did the turn down service.

Personalised service and great amenities make a hotel stay all the more enjoyable and listening to music and watching some hula dancing  while having a drink at House Without a Key was so enchanting and relaxing.

Location was also excellent as we only had a short walk to the main part of Waikiki where we were able to go to many local restaurants and shops.

We also had a great dinner at Nobu opposite the Halekulani located within the Waikiki Parc hotel which is a good quality 4 star sister hotel to the Halekulani. Great service, delicious food and friendly Nobu staff.

The Halekulani is a true 5 star hotel and resort and worth a return visit.

We were given a quick tour around the main areas and the registration was completed in our rooms which was nice. We had booked a garden view room but actually our rooms jutted out and we had a beautiful view of the ocean.  The rooms are understated but very comfortable . The turndown service leaves water and a small gift and message which we all loved. The pool area is well managed and staff set up your sun beds and bring round water and snacks. We only ate once at the beachside restaurant and it was ok. We ate out as there were so many good places nearby. We didn't  want a big hotel breakfast so went to the local shop and ate on our balcony. We did a cultural tour of the hotel with one of the staff who was really informative. We booked a self drive car for the day as the hotel holds a number of rental cars on site.  This was our favourite hotel of our holiday - beautiful, comfortable and well organised.

The hotel is away from the hustle and bustle...an oasis.  We booked a Ocean Front Diamond Head room and located on the 16th floor.  The views are glorious.  The room was very large and included a desk and chair, small sofa and table and a reading lamp.  The tv is very large and the picture was perfect.  The small fridge is refilled every day with water.  Everyday you will find a local newspaper hanging on your door.  Each night we received a small magnet with the orchid logo on it accompanied by note.  The tub is separate from the glass enclosed shower and the toilet is in a separate room with a door.  

I had 2 minor problems with the room.  The slatted doors covering the sliding glass doors did not block out the day light.  I would rather not wake up at 6:00 am on vacation.  The buttons for all the lights to come on and out of room notice stay lit.   

The pool attendants were terrific.  You just pick out your padded loungers and they covered them with terry cloth.  At 2:00 pm the handed out delicious frozen treats.  They were constantly filling the fruited water.

The valets are the front line of the hotel and are excellent.  Very helpful with suggestions and directions.  They always make sure to give you bottled water if you’re going out for a few hours.  

The hotel gets major points from me for using fabric softener on all their towels.  I was surprised the common areas (elevator & hallways) had no a/c.

I could not have picked a better hotel for our 1st visit to Oahu.","Date of stay: May 2014","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

There is also a larger cooler of flavored water and sunscreen for the guests.  The location is perfect and everything seems within walking distance.  We also booked surfing lessons through the hotel with the Ty Gurney Surf school.  The instructors waited for my kids at the hotel's beach and started lessons right there.

We loved it, again!  Service is excellent, and I am not sure they do it but the hotel manages to keep the real hustle and bustle of Waikiki at bay.  The hotel is quiet.  Of course, there is a more mature guest usually staying at the hotel - not a bunch of party animals, but I noticed many families and younger couples like my husband and I.  We were celebrating my husband's birthday and without fail, every staff member at breakfast, the pool, drinks, dinner, etc said happy birthday to my husband.  It was a nice touch!

I had always wanted to stay at the Halekulani and had heard many favourable reports of the supposedly legendary service. Initially I was impressed because an email was sent to me a few weeks before my trip requesting various particulars to help staff get to know me better. I was also asked to provide my arrival time. So when I arrived at the hotel at approximately 8pm there was not a porter in sight. We got out of our car and made our own way to the lobby carrying numerous suitcases up the steps. Eventually a porter arrived but only offered to help me (maybe because I am a women, the guys didn't get a look in). Definitely not a pleasant first impression. Check in was not really friendly and more perfunctory. They were quite disorganised...and asked a few times for our names. My friends were in the tower directly behind reception whereas I was in another tower and was only told to walk down the hallway and turn left. Eventually I found where I was meant to go but was disappointed in the lack of personal service. When I got into my room I was a bit disappointed. I know the hotel had recently been refurbished but I couldn't believe that this tired looking room was the refurbished room. Some pros include that the room size itself was quite big with a king bed and a small sofa, very comfortable bed and lovely sheets, balcony was a very good size and I had a beautiful view of the ocean. Some cons in terms of the room were that the bathroom only had a single sink with limited space for toiletries, bath was deep but not long so definitely not one to linger in and the shower was very compact and water pressure not very strong. I also found it difficult to work the tv. One other negative was that the lights went on automatically in ether cupboard but took a while to turn off when the doors were closed which was annoying when I wanted to go to sleep.

In terms of the restaurants I was not able to get an evening drink at House Without a Key in the three nights I was there as it was packed by the time I got there at around 630pm. There was a queue of about twenty people one night and I was told I could go across the road for a drink. That was pretty disappointing given I was a hotel guest that I couldn't even get a drink in the hotel I was staying at. The buffet breakfast I found disappointing and limited in variety. Certainly not up to five star standard. 

Hotel staff did not go out of their way to assist and seemed uninterested. Concierge and front desk staff were particularly disappointing.

The public areas being were beautiful and smelt incredible - very fresh - and there was a beautiful breeze. Location was great in terms of shopping as it as near Lewers Street and the main shopping street. In terms of beach, although the hotel is ocean front there was not really any beach in don't of the hotel. The pool looked quite beautiful though.

Guests should note that there is a dress code enforced throughout this hotel particularly in here evenings, this didn't bother me as I love to get dressed up. 

In summary, I would not stay at the Halekulani again as I do not think it represents good value for $500+ a night for a standard room. Comparing other hotels in Waikiki that I have stayed at, I would say Trump has far better service, but lacks the ambience of the Halekulani but the Surfrider beats both hands down. It has a better position on the beach compared to the Halekulani and has a more relaxed vibe plus I never got turned away from the Beach Bar because it was full.","Date of stay: June 2014","Trip type: Traveled on business","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

On arrival we received a cordial greeting in the reception area. Our booking was promptly processed and then we received the most comprehensive hotel orientation we have ever received during our many years of traveling. By the time we had settled into our room one could have felt empowered to run the place. 
We booked two garden view rooms and were pleasantly surprised to be upgraded into what was described as ocean view rooms on the 14th floor. Room 1452 has a stunning outlook to the ocean. 

Decor and furnishing quality was of a standard befitting the tariff. The lighting was better than ""US hotel standard"" with innovative mood night lighting under the bedside table skirts, and reading lights that pumped out enough lumens to send vision sensitive persons looking for sun shades. 
Air conditioning worked well and was intelligently interlocked to the opening and closing of the balcony sliding door........providing the best of both climactic worlds.
The bathroom featured separate toilet, glassed in shower stall, and a generously proportioned bath. The housekeeping staff ensured that their was a plentiful supply of toiletries, ice and bathroom linen.
We enjoyed bar and restaurant service at "" House without a key"" and "" Orchids"". Wait staff were attentive. Meal and Beverage offerings were excellent.  However, be advised pricing is at the upper end of the scale.

That said we have always wanted to stay at The Halekulani and we decided to end this trip with four nights in the diamond head room - which was worth the expense.

Their is certainly something special about this resort from the minute you walk in. It has an amazing feel and energy which also has an instant calming effect.

The staff throughout the resort were all world class and nothing short of exceptional, from the time you drive in, to the reception, pool staff, wait staff and the cleaners who all know your name and always greet you with a warm and genuine smile.

What I personally really love is the fact Waikiki is so busy and crowed (why I prefer to be away from the area) when you walk into The Halekulani you leave Waikiki behind and feels (apart from the amazing diamond head view of course) as though you are in a tranquil remote resort.

Our room was amazing, the view as good as it gets and a nice sized room especially as we have a 15 month old son.

There are countless positives, however two negatives which stop this resort being one of the best in the world and they could and should be easily fixed.

Issues;

1) A personal hate of ours is resort where you get down to the pool early at say 8-9am after breakfast to find 50% of the lounge chairs have towels out and are taking, yet of course almost no one is in fact even at the pool. If you want a good spot for the sun you seriously would need to get up up I'm guessing 5-6am to secure a chair, dump some gear on it and come back latter in the day as is the normal practice here. 

We commented on this to the hostess at the buffet breakfast (House With No Key) restaurant and she said ""people are coming down when still dark to secure chairs.

This being a daily challenge, on one day I say a nice spot opening up as the couple were leaving, by chance I was walking by at the time and asked one of the pool attendants to re set up with fresh towels for the 3 of us.  Before I had made it to the back (shaded) chairs to collect our stuff two different people were already trying to get the spot.

I had a laugh with the attendant about how crazy this is and how it's really just luck to get a chair unless you want to camp out over night!

He completely agreed but rightly so, explained it was not something within their control.

I could agree more! The GM of this resort can fix this with little effort!

Why annoy guests who are paying a lot to stay with you in favor of selfish people, but hey I can't really blame them as they are playing the game which is allowed to go on.

One day we saw chairs that had the towels out with sunscreen left on them to claim their land simply not get touched all day and at approx 4pm a gentleman (I use the term loosely) casually stroll up pick up his sunscreen and walk away.

Maybe it is just me, but I think this is seriously annoying and again something the GM can fix within a day!

2) Now at this level of resort including price you pay to stay there are and should be a level of service expected and received. 

Halekulani delivers so well in most areas but to have such a terrible buffet breakfast is unforgivable. 

We've been very lucky and grateful to travel to many parts of the world and this would rate as one of the worst 5 star buffet breakfast we've seen.

Little variety day to day, small selection, not multicultural (surprising as 50% of guests are Japanese, so to see just plain rice basically was shocking) offerings really at all. 

To add insult to injury most selection we found cold, in particular the bacon, cold to mildly warm day in day out. Scrambled eggs, unless you are standing there when they come out, they were cold and hence not worth eating.

They do have an omelet station and this is good but that's about it.

They don't tell you, however if you ask they will kindly bring you items not available to the eye, ie poached eggs and hash browns.

Sadly my wife ordered two poached eggs and 5 mins latter I ordered a hash brown. My hash brown took 10 mins and annoyingly the eggs although order prior come out 2-3 mins after the hash brown.

I travel through out Asia on business and stay 4 star and I can name countless hotel which do a breakfast buffet 5 times better than here.

We had the breakfast package, but don't bother, eat elsewhere - which is a sad thing to say!

Like I said only two negatives and ""1"" is more a pet hate, but it's the little things that make the difference and let's face it, breakfast isn't a little thing.

Amazing resort, amazing staff, amazing energy and feel, just fix the simple things and you'll not only become best in Hawaii but world leading and world beating.

GM along food and beverage manager need to step up and bring these areas into line with the rest of the resort which really is exceptional....","Date of stay: June 2014","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

We were lucky enough to say at the Diamond Head Suite, which boasts the most jaw dropping view! The Halekulani also houses some of the top restaurants in Honolulu. We were fortunate to visit: Orchids (incredible Sunday brunch); Lewers Lounge (great intimate atmosphere with staff who really know their cocktails); House without a Key (nice outdoor venue with refreshing array of drinks and a crab sandwich, which my wife cannot stop raving about!); and the in room dining option was also very nice.

Our Catering Manger, Loren is a first class professional. She was incredibly efficient to deal with and responded to all our questions via email in lightening efficiency (something we valued  as we were planning our wedding half way around the world). Our banquet manager during the wedding, Steven was also a charm to deal with. He was courteous to all our guests & vendors, and also anticipated our needs to make our day stress free and more enjoyable.

The wedding ceremony was held outside at the Terrace and we were lucky in that the rain stopped for long enough for the ceremony. We then had fabulous appetizers with an open bar prior to the dinner - Peking duck, large tempura shrimp, feta cheese appetizers, satay chicken, yum!!! The dinner itself was held in a smaller area and the dinner was good - Chinese theme to it so the fish was in a broth base. The steak was somewhat tough though or at least that was what I heard. The appetizers was definitely better than the main meal. The disappointing thing was the space. The dinner itself was held in a very cramped space and supposedly, there was a dance floor right in the middle - which there really was not enough space. And really hampered ppl's wanting to dance after the dinner. Also, everyone had to be out by 10:30 pm which is quite remarkable to me considering the cost of the wedding itself to have that type of time curfew. On the positives, the staff were very good and parking was readily available through their parking lot. Overall, we very much enjoyed the wedding, just felt bad that there wasn't enough space/time for the wedding itself.","Date of stay: May 2014","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

Arrived here in the afternoon after a five and a half hour flight from LA. Checked in and they took us to the room. we walked out onto the balcony and it was so open it made me feel dizzy. i said to the porter this is awful and he said you can stand back in the room for a view! unpacked then went for a walk around.  the sun loungers  had an inch space between the other ones it was like rows of sardines!! we decided to look on the beach.  it was dirty and not like paradise at all. I said to my husband i dont think we can stay here but we decided to give it the benefit of the doubt so decided to get ready and have dinner. went to the outside restaurant at 9.05 pm and was told sorry to late for dinner so we had to went outside of the hotel where we found a lovely restaurant across the street.  next morning came downstairs and went to the breakfast restaurant and said we wanted just some coffee not the buffet and were told sorry cant do that ovver there you can get some courtesy take out! in paper cups!!! went to get some beach towels and half the beds had already been reserved but managed to get two.  inbetween the beds were toe nails!!     we went back to the room and found another hotel in the north of the island.  it certainly isnt a 5 star hotel and it certainly wasnt paradise as you would expect Hawaii to be.  A concrete jungle is more apt including Waikiki the town as well as the hotel.

This was actually a second visit which was just as good as the first time.  It is worth paying for an ocean view room although the architecture of this building means all rooms have a pleasing aspect. Our room was on the 14th floor and this too makes a difference.  You are actually taken to your room to be shown the amenities and to complete guest registration which is a nice touch.  Unlike most of the other beachfront hotels (Sheraton, Moana Surfrider, Royal Hawaiian) non paying guests cannot readliy access the ocean via the hotel lobby which makes for greater privacy. There are a variety of restaurants to cater for all price levels and dining preferences. Impeccable service throughout the hotel. Each day I took a swim in the ocean(there is a private gate for hotel guests) followed by a dip in the absolutely stunning hotel pool.
Check Japanese holiday times if family groups are an issue for you; the hotel is a wedding venue and each day there are multiple weddings but we did not find these intrusive.  My only grizzle, no tea coffee making facilty in the rooms, it is not acceptable in a five star hotel to be required to come down to the pool area to obtain takeaway kona coffees (no tea available).","Date of stay: May 2014","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

This hotel offers an absolute oasis of serenity in the middle of the hustle of Waikiki - while still providing easy access to all the action. Staff are super attentive and helpful, from the mini tour on arrival to familiarise guests with the facilities, to the server who appears poolside the moment you pick up the menu. Housekeeping was exceptional and there were lots of gorgeous little touches, such as the melt-in-the-mouth chocolates, the fresh fruit platter, the individually boxed seashells and signature bookmark, that appeared as if by magic in our rooms each day. If you have kids, take them to dinner one night at the Cheesecake Factory. The concierge will call ahead and save you half the wait-time on your arrival. 

There were enough families staying in the hotel for us not to feel out of place… but no shrieking children in the pool, either. The Halekulani struck that perfect balance, with a mix of honeymooners, families and older couples. 

The management and staff are utterly professional and the level of service, combined with the idyllic setting, make this a memorable place to stay.

Lastly: Pack your goggles or mask so you can appreciate the beauty of the coral and the sea life just metres away from the sandy beach in front of the hotel.

However, the Halekulani hotel, while being in the middle of the action, is relatively chill.  We were there leading up to Easter weekend and we're not overrun by families with kids running wild.  It's certainly not a mature persons hotel either, with lots of younger (mid 20s-30s) couples from across the Pacific.  One thing that I did notice is just how noisy the area is.  Not from parties in rooms etc, but helicopters over the water, police sirens, traffic etc and we had a beach front room.  It brings me back to the Vegas thing.

The hotel, while older has been remodeled to the T.  The rooms were some of the better appointed rooms I have experienced in a hotel.  Heaps of storage in the bathroom for my wife's 'stuff' and a cool closet that opened with sliding doors both in the room and the bathroom.  All in all, if you are looking for a little oasis, excellent service and very accommodating staff in the hustle and bustle of Honolulu, this is your place.  

PS, if you are looking to rent halfway decent surf or paddle boards, there is a store directly over the road called Ty gurneys.  Nice people but there equipment blows.  I took my care 2 miles down the road to 'Go Bananas' and rented a Surftech board for a fraction of the price for 2 days.","Date of stay: April 2014","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

They were a little late for the evening turn down which came around 8-8:30 after we were already back from dinner and our younger two kids in bed.

We had two adjoining ocean front rooms which fronted the pool with the beach behind it.  Set back in the base of the U shaped main building.  The two rooms shared a common foyer which has a locking door so we were able to keep the interior doors for each room open permanently.  Large spacious rooms with sitting area and a big lanai (chaise, table and two chairs).  Well furnished with large flat screen, HDTV service and a blu-ray DVD player.  Updated lighting/HVAC controls beside and outlets on desk and on dresser.  Bathroom doors are just louvered french doors so if you value privacy, not the best.  Also, no mini bar; instead the mini fridge has complimentary water bottles which is even better.  Fine service on the wifi which also worked well pool side.

The overall property was immaculate with large pool big enough for a swimming workout in the mornings.  No issue with finding chaise loungers at any time during the day.  Since the sun goes across the property all areas get sun at some point of day so no one preferred spot spreading the demand across all poolside areas.  They have a great setup with the valets putting fitted covers over the cushions for every user each day and provide complimentary snacks and water.

Since this is the high end hotel in Waikiki, not as many kids but very kid friendly.  One benefit is that the pool itself is rarely used so not crowded at all for the kids.  Peak afternoon there would be only 4-5 kids and few adults.  Very small beach though, if you are a die hard lie in the sand person, not the hotel for you.  At high tide the beach practically disappears.

I think it has the perfect location in Waikiki as you are at end of a spur road on western portion of Waikiki off the main road (Kalakaua) so not crowded at all but you have the new Waikiki Beach Walk and the shops at the Royal Hawaiian a block away providing all the retail and dining options you need off site.  No real sundry shop but an ABC store is right across the street.  No water sport concession either but adjacent hotels on both sides have them so they are easily available.  If you want to surf, a surf school is right across the street which uses the beach in front of hotel and the hotel can store surf boards in the pool area overnight if you want to surf more.

Some reviews were critical about the number of weddings which is correct but impact was negiligible.  Only once did we ever see the wedding party outside of the lobby.  Complaint about the pool temp was also mentioned which was not correct.  Pool temp is around 82, ocean was 80 and my kids found the temps perfect.  Overall, the most satisfied with a hotel I've been on a family vacation I've ever been.  Can't wait to return.","Date of stay: April 2014","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Things like, using my name, remembering I like tea v. coffee, little nightlights under the bedside tables, soft/clean smelling towels, water and ice replenished 2x/day, fruit in room, little tokens/gifts with each turndown, an incredibly clean smelling room after each housekeeping, snacks at the pool, music/hula dancers on the lawn in front of the ocean every night.  I'm running out of space!  The hotel is oriented so 90%+ of the rooms have an ocean view (I took the hotel historical tour and found that out. Do the tour! It's not corny. It really made the hotel and its history come alive. You'll be surprised!).  It is an oasis in Wacky Waikiki.  If you want a party all night hotel, stay somewhere else.  They require resort wear but no one looked stuffy...just nice without sandy flip flops and teeny bathing suits in the restaurants.  Private beach with a waikiki running through it, i.e.  no coral to cut your feet on.  Food was good. La Mer was overpriced and not as unique as I thought it would be.  The open areas, breezeways, verandas were fabulous.  You lounge at the hotel and then pop outside to do 'city' stuff. The best of both.  Great help from the concierges. Finally, the view was breathtaking when the reception attendant walked us to our room and flung open the louver doors in the little foyer to reveal a gorgeous ocean view (12th floor, Pool View Room).  The closet is between the bathroom and bedroom, and both doors open so you can be in the tub or shower and still see the view.  Only thing I would change is to have a leisure bar that is open throughout the day and I would pick a more easterly facing room, as we had sun on our patio all afternoon.

Your car picks us up at the airport but the bell men and front desk still don't know our name? There's no one else around but we need to wait in the lobby? Where by the way?  Not like it was before when you were greeted and escorted straight to your room. 

Once in our room, which is fine but small, turns out they didn't leave enough towels, robes. Had to call about that. The phone was broken.  Had to call about that. One day we got a paper. One day we didn't. One day we got more water in the fridge, one day we didn't.  One day the bathroom floor wasn't cleaned so hair was left (hopefully ours) on it. 

Really sloppy.  We met some folks staying in the royal suite and their comment was one of being nickel and dimed. Wow.

We had heard that Waikiki was a bit of a circus, and not worth spending too much time there...and we were seriously sad that we didnt have more time to enjoy it!!

The area is bustling and full of fun things to do. After spending all that time in remote romantic quiet areas, we really enjoyed the change of pace. 

As for the hotel itself, we were very happy here. We were upgraded to a diamond head view room, which had a nice big balcony and the aforementioned view. There was an exotic fruit plate and a bottle of champagne in the room waiting for us, as well as little chocolates and other treats and a nice congratulatory note on our wedding.

The decor was simple and modern, mostly white with some blue accents in the bathroom. The grounds were lovely, with lots of different dining options in the hotel and nearby. We loved Orchids, that was really spectacular. We also did the tasting menu at La Mer...and though it was really great as well, it was a lot of food and we kind of ran out of steam toward the end. The staff was kind enough to send our dessert course and the wine pairing up to our room so we could enjoy it there. That was a wonderful touch.

Breakfast at Orchids was better than the buffet at House without a Key, we thought. We ordered the American Breakfast and the Japanese breakfast [just to mix it up]...and the Japanese one was mostly too off the wall for us at that time of the morning, haha. 

The pool area was lovely, and we weren't too bothered about the lack of beach. The beaches are filled with families and loud nonsense, and the pool was quiet and relaxed and private. They also served the absolute best mai tai i had on the entire hawaii trip! That's saying a lot, since we were on 4 islands at a Ritz Carlton, Four Seasons,  St Regis, etc...all the best spots did not compare to this mai tai! Plus it was presented really nicely with a little orchid in the glass. 

The only complaint we have is the housekeeping...we were only there 2 nights, but each time the staff came in to ""clean"", they left half-eaten plates of food, day-old glasses of wine [with only a sip or two left in them], and just placed napkins or paper coasters on top as if we were going to come back from our day out and savor that last sip of old red wine. It was really strange. If we had been out on the beach dragging sand into the room, we wondered if that would have been left behind as well. 

There were very few children there [SCORE!] and it had a very adult, romantic vibe.

They want you to order room service or wait for breakfast at 7am. You have a small balcony and water bottles (free) in the room, which is nice. No minibar. 

Location.. If you like to be in town, hearing the cars, seeing a lot of people, and having a lot of things going on, you will like the location. If you prefer a peaceful and more serene place, you may want to change island haha. Its very busy here. Very touristic. One thing that is very beautiful is that you can see Diamond's head from the hotel! (You can also go hike it, which is gorgeous from the top!) 

Beach.. There is not really a beach in front of the hotel, which I thought was disappointing. You have to walk (mainly on your left side) to go to a nicer, longer beach.. Its very busy.. Lots of family as well. You can do paddle boards and other activities which is nice. The waves aren't very big. If you want to see big waves, you have to go to another beach. 

Food.. very disappointing. It's very expensive for what you get, and it's good but not excellent. I can make better food at home (seriously)! Room service.. Very small menu. Couldn't find anything I like. Room service taxes and charge is very high. Breakfast buffet, however, is really nice. It opens at 7am. You have fresh fruits, cheese, eggs, waffles, croissant, japanese foods, salads, smoked salmon, etc. 

Pool.. Nice but very simple, nothing special. Its an oval pool (not very big) with no view of the ocean.

Spa is nice but not that great. Very expensive for what you get. My massage was fine but not excellent.. They don't get you a robe or anything.. They just make you go straight to the room.. You get a tea after your treatment while waiting outside, which was nice. A 50 min Swedish massage cost 175$. It includes a mini feet ritual (~5 min). Prices are not on the spa menu in the room. You have to call. 

Service.. Good service. Very polite and friendly people!","Date of stay: March 2014","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

My recent stay was marred by a front desk that did not deliver and the insane number of weddings overrunning the resort. 

I booked thru the AMEX fine hotels program. One amenity is early check in. I was arriving at 2 pm and was transported by Hotel limo.  I wanted to hit the ground running so I requested the moderately early check in and repeated my request when  booked the hotel car. 

When I arrived I was not greeted and led to the front desk as I always had before.  
The desk clerk did not greet me as a repeat returning guest, was not particularly welcoming and informed me that no upgrade was available (fine they are based on availability) but the kicker was my room was not ready either.  Frankly for a hotel with the motto ""For you everything"" it seemed more like ""For you nothing"" 

For a hotel that calls itself the best to say no to an arriving guest twice at check  is truly sloppy. Particularly when you are supposedly offering them as part of a AMEX program. 2 pm check is too much for the Halekulani ,wow, how the mighty have fallen  When I did finally get my room I could not help notice is was the worst location (farthest back from beach in the Diamond Head View category booked. I would rate the entire check in experience as terrible.

Additionally the weddings were everywhere at all hours. One could not help being surrounded by picture taking sessions. I got bumped off the bench at 7:30 a.m. in the porte-cochere by wedding party picture taking. 

While having dinner at Orchids we were seated outside with a lovely view across the lawn to Diamond head. Suddenly all the tables behind us were pushed together and a Wedding Cake , tables, flowers ect. were set up on the lawn in front where our view used to be. . We now had a cake cutting shoot directly In front of our table and tables full of guests all around us. Even our waiter looked a little embarrassed by the sudden instant wedding party of which we were now in the center.  I was like a scene in a Fellini Movie. Our waiter however was excellent. 

It is clear to me that the wedding machine is out of control here and takes priority over other guests.  I have been to Hawaii many times and I know weddings are like palm trees--everywhere. But this was out of line. 

The rest of my stay was the typical Halekulani perfection, Their food is still the best. But overall they have fallen behind the top competition. There was cool competence but no aloha. 

I extended my stay in Waikiki but did not remain at the Halekulani. I hate to say it but I found a better view, better grounds, more aloha, better room and better dedication to customer service at that Pink Palace down the beach. Not to mention a much fairer price.  And not once did I have to move to make way for a pop-up wedding.

I guess not even the venerable Halekulani can not  stay the same. My terrible reception, crowded wedding party atmosphere, and the lack of any special concern by the staff for customer satisfaction makes this my final stay.","Date of stay: July 2013","Trip type: Traveled solo","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

The Halekulani does not compare with the best. It is in the Leading Hotels of the World group, but a hotel like the Ritz  London blows it away. Standing on its own, this hotel is like a dish of sweet and sour pork.  Sweet- breakfast at the Orchid restaurant- serene, peaceful, excellent food and fruit and fresh squeezed juice overlooking the ocean and Diamond Head.  Sour- the horrible beach- a small spit often taken up by a catamaran, with silty sand and much coral- ugh. Not close to the perfect crescent Waikiki beach- you need to go to the Royal Hawaiian for that.  Sweet- the large and peaceful pool area.  Sour- mushy beds and an extremely small shower-  I have back issues and the bed was a disaster.  Also, I like to aim the shower at my lower back- but the shower was so small I could not even bend in there.  Sweet- the nightly trio playing Hawaiian music with a hula dancer on the lawn having drinks looking over the ocean.  Sour- trying to get reservations for dinner at the Orchid at a reasonable time- I was there for 8 days and rented 3 rooms and literally had to complain to the hotel manager to get a reservation!  Sour- we are Virtuoso and not only did we not get any room upgrades but when my kids wanted to stay a little past normal checkout we were denied even one minute extra.  For $2,000 per night with 450 rooms they could have figured out a way for the kids to stay in the room a little longer.  Sour- giving away my kids chairs that were under an umbrella to someone else, when they went to the ocean to swim.  Sweet- that the pool server and the room attendant knew our names and recognized us.  All in all, there were too many disappointments to recommend this place.","Date of stay: February 2014","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

Whether your visit to Oahu is a first-time special occasion, or you are returning for business or vacation, try to stay at the Halekulani.  Its location on the beach in the center of Waikiki means you are surrounded by the best area activities and restaurants.  The Halekulani is an oasis of serenity, beautiful ocean views, sunsets, and Hawaiian history.  We’ve stayed here many times, and appreciate everyone's smiles and welcomes throughout the day:  bell men, registration, management, poolside attendants, restaurant servers, housekeeping and evening turn-down staff.  Top-notch service is standard. There rarely was a problem during our visit, and when there was it was rapidly corrected.   
There are three towers of rooms; we like the Ewa Tower for its peacefulness and ocean views from many rooms.  Most rooms have partial ocean or ocean views; rooms farther forward towards the ocean have views of Diamond Head.  There is no coffee/beverage maker in the room, would have been nice to have one with mugs and spoons for our own tea, coffee and cocoa. For early morning risers there is complimentary coffee/tea downstairs. Rooms have a small refrigerator and complimentary bottles of water are provided each day. 
Be sure to take advantage of complimentary admission for hotel guests to notable cultural venues in Honolulu, including the Honolulu Museum of Art, The Bishop Museum and Iolani Palace.
Halekulani has one gorgeous pool, comfortably heated in winter, plenty of lounge chairs and many with umbrellas.  Staying poolside is a vacation in itself, with complimentary chilled water, pineapple, muffins, popsicles and sunscreen, plus poolside menu service.  Bowls of mixed nuts to snack on while reading poolside would be a welcome addition.
In early February the hotel was very busy.  Only once during a dinner at House Without a Key did that create a problem, causing service not up to Halekulani’s standards. Our dinners at Orchids were impeccable. 
There are three hotel restaurants: “House Without a Key” is resort casual for breakfast, lunch and dinner, with sunset libations and Hawaiian entertainment every evening.  “Orchids” is resort dressy for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and “La Mer” is dressy, dinner only, French menu and jackets required.  Afternoon high tea is a treat at The “Veranda”, and “Lewers Lounge” features live jazz entertainment in the evenings.  
The ""Sunrise"" package with room & breakfast is a good value and includes your beverages, taxes and gratuity. Most mornings we chose the buffet at House Without a Key because of excellent choices in fresh fruit, a made-to-order omelet station, and so many bakery and entrée selections for light or hungry appetites.  Even though it is a buffet, service is still personalized. 
Halekulani carries a 100-year legacy of Hawaiian history.  It was rebuilt in the 1980’s, adhering to  architectural detail to retain the character of the original resort while still providing modern urban necessities.  It is a smaller property, only 5 acres, with grass courtyards and palms between the towers for serenity. The beach directly in front of the hotel is small, but walk either direction left or right and you are on Waikiki’s main beaches.  All the amenities and craziness of Waikiki surround you, but when you stay at Halekulani, you are in an elegant, peaceful oasis.","Date of stay: February 2014","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The name of the hotel translates to ""house befitting heaven"" and we found it to be aptly named.  The property isn't large and so there aren't acres of gardens, walkways and beachfront that one would find on the other islands, as Waikiki is crowded with high-rise condos, shops, tourists.  We wandered out and about in the area but we were enveloped in peace and graciousness once we stepped back into the Halekulani.  

Soon after our arrival, we returned to our room and found a bottle of champagne waiting for us with a card from the management wishing us a happy anniversary.  

The rooms are comfortable and understated and we enjoyed a full ocean view.  A bucket of ice, bottled water, clean glasses were delivered to our room twice a day and there was turndown service each evening.  Every night we found a small pillow present  - keychain, luggage tag, a jar of bath salts from the spa.  

Each evening there was entertainment at House Without a Key - Hawaiian musicians and vocalists.  A hula dancer made an occasional appearance too.  It was a lovely place to sit and enjoy a tropical cocktail while watching the sunset and having dinner.  The first evening our server, Kelly, brought us a complimentary piece of coconut cake and wished us a happy anniversary.  We encountered her again a few days later and she greeted us by name.  

We had the buffet breakfast at House Without a Key once and the other mornings we enjoyed breakfast at Orchids.  The food and service were excellent.

One day we joined a small group and took the ""Back of the House Tour"".  Our guide was a lovely and lively woman who has worked at the Halekulani for 30 years.  It was fun to see the hotel bakeries, laundry, floral shop, print shop.  We received a long stem rose in the floral shop, sweet treats in the bakery and were treated to beverages and small slices of cheesecake and coconut cake on the terrace at the end of the tour.  The ""Royal Suite"" was vacant and so we were able to see that too.

It is clearly the best resort in the area -- and one of the best we have ever visited. 

If you value a world-class pool area and want the convenience of Waikiki, this is the only real choice. There is only one pool, but it is large. With its famous mosaic orchid, it is also stunningly beautiful. Never once was it too crowded. The roomy pool area has ample sun loungers. There is no early-morning scramble to get a decent spot. If you decide your spot has gotten too sunny, you can just take a shadier spot. There is no canned music near the pool. The guests -- and their children -- were uniformly unobtrusive.   

Pools at the other Waikiki hotels we saw were either very crowded or very tiny -- or both. For instance, the Royal Hawaiian and the Moana Surfrider have a lot of historic charm, but their pool areas are amazingly cramped and unappealing.  The pool at the newish Trump hotel seems more like a lap pool. 

The entire atmosphere at the Halekulani exudes low-keyed elegance.  The rooms aren't particularly large or lavish, but they are tasteful and comfortable. Except for the special luxury suites, all the rooms are essentially identical. The price varies only according to the view.  There is no such thing as a bad room or a bad view. Unlike the situation in some places, the ""garden view""  rooms here actually overlook a pleasant garden rather than a parking lot. You  could be better off in the cheapest room here than in the best room in many resorts. 

Last year, we stayed in a room with a view of Diamond Head, which was wonderful. This year, we saved nearly $1,000 by taking an ""ocean view"" room, which was about 98% as wonderful.  Some view of nearby high-rises, but a gorgeous panoramic view of the ocean as well. We would certainly take this class of room again. We asked for a high floor and we got the top floor. Perhaps being a repeat customer helped, but the hotel does seem to try to meet your requests. 

Indeed, the service here was flawless. Every single staff member we encountered was pleasant and helpful. It must be a good place to work: Some of the pool attendants and servers in the breakfast room have been here over 20 years. 

It definitely paid to get the package including breakfast -- excellent choices served in two different pleasant rooms with delightful water views. Incidentally, when we reserved our room, months in advance, the package deal wasn't yet available online. So we were advised to rebook again later, which we did. 

There were a couple of quirks: Strange as it seems, the rooms don't have coffee makers for hot water. But this year, my partner brought along one of those little electric gadgets that you insert into a cup to heat your water. Problem solved!  Also, depending on its mood, the convenient bathroom scale gives your weight in pounds, kilograms -- or British-style stones.  Eventually we located the unmarked button on the back that gives you pounds only. Such are the trials of life in paradise. 

One of the advantages of Waikiki is the convenience to restaurants (and shopping).  We enjoyed Taormina and Il Lupino, both just a few minutes walk from the hotel.  We had one of our most memorable and interesting meals in years at Alan Wong's, a short cab ride away.  In the same surprisingly nondescript neighborhood, Chef Mavro was quite pleasant too, but you might want a magnifying glass to see some of the portions. 

Having driven around the island on another trip, this year we took an afternoon tour of East Oahu, including some really spectacular mountain scenery that tourists often overlook. On the one drizzly day, we went to the Honolulu Museum of Art, another frequently overlooked attraction that was quite worthwhile, especially for the Asian art.

As for his question about the Surf Rider, that property is louder and the service doesn't come near Halekulani. Halekulani's customer base is also different...maybe it's the dress code, which I truly appreciate.","Date of stay: April 2013","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Rooms make it only a good one. Don't get me wrong. We loved our stay at the Halekulani. For a first time to Hawaii visitor, this hotel and staff had ,and gave, more than i could ask for. But after the helpful check- in and the attendant  to our room had opened our room door to show us around, the slight sigh of disappointment might have been obvious to all. To nail it on the head, it was just a little dated, furniture, bathroom etc. It wasn't the sort of room that you looked forward to returning to after a day or night out. Maybe I am being a little harsh, the room had all you could ask for. And a stunning view to boot. And the rest of the hotel shone very brightly. We were on the top floor, of an ocean view room (i think 1408),this gave us an exceptional sunset every night. But also an early morning alarm. As the closeness of the huge, overbearing Sheraton next door, ensured that no matter how high up you were, the noisy, 5.30am delivery trucks and their reversing beepers, delivering to the Sheraton woke you up! This didn't spoil our stay at the hotel. But it didn't give me the desire to award this hotel my top marks. Maybe another room( if it's been updated) in the other wings might have proved a better choice? But I am still going to recommend this hotel. Because the staff were exceptional, their manner and helpfulness should be rewarded. Also the rest of the hotel gave me complete satisfaction. Dinning, poolside- lunch and breakfast was a great service treat. Also a mention to the hotel concierge staff, whom in every hotel I visit ,I always ask for their recommendations. And the staff here didn't disappoint, they shone brightly, very helpful. Would I go back? I would if I knew the rooms had been updated. My wife? She want's to try the ""Surf Rider"". What do you think? And for a first time visitor to Hawaii, did I enjoy it? Well it wasn't quite what I expected, had the image of Maui, more in my mind. But yes I enjoyed it. Just like America, but on a small island is how my amazing wife described it...true!","Date of stay: January 2014","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

It was our first extended stay on Oahu and the Halekulani made it memorable. Great welcoming staff, terrific, ocean view rooms. and a concierge staff that never failed to perform. And we really tested them !!
The on site restaurants were beautiful with open patio seating and  ocean breezes to enjoy with any meal. I preferred the less formal 'House without a Key'. They have a fabulous roast pork hash to pair with eggs on the buffet line. We ate at Orchids on occasion but avoided the dressier La Mer. I'm sure it is very nice if you like 'Island Formal' 
There is nothing you can do about the traffic in Honolulu but having the Halekulani to retire to makes it better.
The staff, once again , made the hotel even better. Friendly, informative, engaging...just what we would always hope for in a Hawaiian vacation.

Wouldn't be fair to 5 star hotels though. I'll dispense with the nits first: the beach in front is tiny, the outer halves of the balconies are not private either for sight or sound, no in-room coffee or expresso maker, room carpeting possibly has overstayed it's welcome. None of these were bad; I make these comments in context of the room being $900 a night.

The positives? The staff throughout are outstanding. Perhaps not as spit-and-polish as I've experienced say, in Four Seasons Tokyo, but exceedingly trained and caring. There's the usual 5 star reception - you generally don't stand in line to be summoned to the next wicket; they come out from the counter and walk you back; they later walk you to and tour your room, etc. That your stay be an outstanding experience appears genuinely important to every one of these people. If it's just an act, it's a good one. We did comment to the front desk about the coffee maker (we thought maybe it was just missing); a hot water dispenser was in our room when we returned. In the middle of booking a helicopter flight with the concierge we joked we didn't know our exact weight because our bathroom scale wasn't working, and we were happy it wasn't. ""I'll note that,"" she said. It was fixed when we returned from breakfast. I asked the server to take our picture - I apologized for interrupting his work (I asked for lots of pictures). ""This is my work"", he said. I could go on - nuances of attention and attentiveness repeated daily. We had booked 4 nights; we extended to 9.

Some reviewers have dissed the hotel's dress code. Don't be fussed. The place is not the least pretentious.  If want to walk through a hotel public area in a thong, do it in a different hotel; you'll look like a rube here. The guests are tasteful – quite different from the beach-chair-backpackers you'll find trekking through Hilton Hawaiian Village. You can dress as you wish in the more causal ""Room without a Key"" poolside/beachfront restaurant; food and service are excellent.
Pool is perhaps on the smallish side, but never busy. There are more than enough lounges to accommodate all comers - and do so with ample space. And if it isn't obvious from the hotel's location, major shopping and dining starts just across the street.

The hotel hosted small weddings in the courtyard almost daily. Made for nice pictures for us actually. Conferences or receptions almost nightly; never noisy or intrusive on our stay; hardly knew they were there.

Based on advice of another TripAdvisor review, we booked a Diamond Head view. Loved it. For the second part of our stay we moved to a room closer to the ocean. Better view (less obstructed the by the Sheraton Hotel), but the view from the first was great. Worth the money? I can't rationally justify it, but we thought so.

By the way, my wife raved about the spa. ""Never been served a snack after a massage"", she said, ""Seated overlooking the ocean too. The whole atmosphere was elegant."" Maybe we're just peasants; surely lots of other places in the world do this. But my wife has been to countless spas.","Date of stay: January 2014","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

First time stay at the Halekulani and we cant praise it any higher. From the greeting on arrival and being escorted to our room and explained the room and the hotels features, we were made to feel very welcome. The room was terrific, roomy and clean. The hotel is spotless, the staff very friendly. We had an ocean view room and the view of the ocean and beach was superb. We watched one day the whales frolicking in the sea.
Each night the turndown service left a small gift on the bed, it was a great touch.
Wednesday nights the hotel has a cocktail party for guests, it was fun and the managers attend and chat to guests, it was very enjoyable.
The hotel is located in the heart of Honolulu, and it is very surprising the lack of noise from busy Honolulu. It is only a 5- 10 min walk to the main shops.
The only problem we had was no tea or coffee making facilities in the room.

My fiancé was hung up on the expense but as this was going to be a one-off splurge, I convinced him to go for it!. Well, we fell totally in love with Halekulani and couldn't have chosen a better hotel, worth every single penny. So much so, that last year we made the long trip from Northern Ireland to take my parents to experience the Hawaii and of course the Halekulani!. I did ask my fiancé where he wanted to stay this time and he said he would NOT stay anywhere else!. Forget the cost!

As we pulled up to the hotel, the door was graciously opened and the staff member said Welcome to the Halekulani Miss Anderson! How was your flight from Las Vegas Wow, impressed!! The bags were whisked away to the rooms and check-in was completed by the fantastic Jerome, who throughout our stay helped us, answered our questions and made us feel very welcome. He is a major asset to Halekulani.

This hotel is serene. calm and beautiful, you are in the centre of Waikiki with restaurants, bar, Waikiki beach and fabulous shops (Tiffany's, Macys etc) on your doorstep yet the hotel is quiet and relaxing. The pool area is perfect with great attendants to help you with your sunlounger. Each night there was a lovely little present left on our bed at turndown, the rooms were pretty, bright and clean.

We were lucky enough to have both breakfast and brunch at Orchids which were both out of this world with regards to food, setting, atmosphere and especially service. Our particular waiter Aga, was outstanding. He was polite and there exactly when you need him without being intrusive, each time we got up to go to the buffet he had the table cleared and brushed!, before we returned with another course!.

There are regular weddings happening at this hotel but they are small and do not interfere with any aspect of your stay, in my opinion they actually add to the whole atmosphere and you can see why people would want to celebrate such a happy occasion in these surroundings. Also, the manager holds a little evening on one of the terraces during the week which serves complimentary food and drinks looking over Waikiki Beach at Sunset. 

The Halekulani employs lovely people who understand the true meaning of customer service and are always friendly, polite and willing to help. The Halekulani has given us wonderful memories that will stay with us forever. We will definitely return.","Date of stay: June 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

For the first time we decided to explore Oahu and find a hotel in Honolulu.  We did a lot of research and found only two or perhaps three hotels in the true five-star category.  On several recommendations from friends we settled on the Halekulani.  This is a beautiful, well located hotel, with a gorgeous lobby and common area, a nice spa, and nice, albeit austere, guest rooms (we took a Diamond Head Suite).  The area shopping is perfect, with all the high end brands as well as local shops just steps away. The hotel hosts many weddings, which is perhaps one of the reasons for its MAJOR drawback:  

It is formal and full of rules that hamper your relaxing vacation experience.  Don't come here expecting island-causal, lounging in flip-flops, taking a drink at a pool bar and strolling with that drink back to your room.  The hotel has strict rules:  No carrying drinks from a bar to your room; there is no pool bar you can sit at (only table service) and no ""bar"" open until 6:00 pm, and that one is an indoor, wood-paneled, formal one (beautiful, by the way, like you'd see in a New York business-oriented restaurant) where the guests are expected to be dressed the same; it closes at 1:00 am, however, we saw at least one couple refused service at 12:25 am, saying ""sorry we've already had 'last call'; and pack some dress slacks and business shirts because--get this--the hotel's restaurant doesn't any permit jeans you might have, no matter how nice they are.  We made reservations at the hotel restaurant and were walking to our dinner when a hotel employee stopped us saying ah, ah, ah.. ""if you're going to the restaurant you'll need dress slacks.""  My girl was in a Roberto Cavalli dress she bought for the trip, Christian Louboutin shoes--both sexy and informal--and I was in brand-new Kiton Jeans, a designer silk shirt, and leather Gucci slip-ons that were suitable for any boardroom.  No soap--we weren't ""properly attired,"" as I had on jeans.  No business casual for your Hawaiian vacation here!   Steve Jobs could run the largest company in the world in nice jeans, but he couldn't get a meal at the Halekulani's restaurant dressed that way.  To add insult to injury, the hotel then directed us off-property to a Denny's-style Thai restaurant a good walk from the hotel.  My date was insulted, and with good reason.  

A very nice hotel manager listened patiently to my complaints, sympathized, but confessed there was little he could do.  He called Nobu at a ""sister property"" and asked if our ""poor-man's"" attire would be okay, and nicely informed me that the coast was clear--we could eat there in jeans. Good grief.  This is a vacation destination? 

Finally, if you figure, well we'll just be casual with a drink in the room from the minibar, sorry, no minibar.  They took them all out, a hotel employee informed us.  You'll have to call room service even to order a Mai Tai or a glass of wine; and room service is quite slow--about 35 minutes for two drinks.  

This hotel appears to have a dedicated clientele and for good reason:  It's nice.  But it is NOT relaxing, and it is not the place to go to experience island casual and have a relaxing vacation where you leave your formal clothes for the office back home.","Date of stay: January 2014","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

There are great facilities if you check in early or need to take a shower after checking out.  This was terrific for our late night flight home.

While this hotel, its staff, food, location and service are not perfect  - it is the closest thing to it.  

All of my arrangements were made through the concierge - not a mistake was made, all the details were handled flawlessly. If you are planning a trip to the Halekulani - connect early with your concierge for dinner reservations, car service, special pillows, etc., it will save you time in the long run.  I used the same concierge for both trips and she is the finest concierge I have ever met. 

For eight days I ate at the breakfast buffet and it was still delicious and fresh after eight days. House Without A Key staff are wonderful, kind and love what they do.

Housekeeping - wonderful room cleaning staff and evening turn-down service.  You may miss this the most when you leave.

Spa - truly gifted massage technicians.  I had a sports injury that flared up that was so bad I could barely move so I camped out in front of the Halekulani Spa until they opened and they were able to treat me that morning.  I received instant relief and each day I got better and better.

We got married here in February 2012 and I have to say that the service from their Catering & Front Office team was fantastic.  I never had to worry about anything - from the time we were making arrangements from Vancouver to the we checked out, everything was taken care of for us.

ROOMS - We had one of the corner suites and the view was amazing. I could just live there.   The room was clean and the bathroom and closet was as big as the room itself!  It definitely felt like paradise.

SPA - We enjoyed a spa in a couple's room which had a personal changing room/shower attached.  It felt pretty luxurious.

RESTAURANT - A very romantic restaurant where the views were all breathtaking.  One would be reminded of how beautiful a place Honolulu was and you can hear the sounds of the ocean.  We tried their 5-course tasting menu and I was full by the third course.  I was not sure if it was butterflies for my wedding next day or that the portions were very big!  All in all, it was deilcious.

CATERING/BANQUETS - I cannot say enough of how friendly and professional the staff were to deal with during our planning process.  Everything was what I imagined it to be.  All our guests really enjoyed the atmosphere and said they enjoyed one of the best meals at a wedding.","Date of stay: February 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The rooms are small and cramped, despite the view, for we Caucasians but are probably fine for the Japanese owners and many patrons.
As a first time visitor to Honolulu I was disappointed by the total disconnect between the overbuilt and over crowded of today Waikiki and the Hawaii from old films and TV series.
I had trouble telling the difference between Waikiki and Miami Beach, except the second language there is Japanese.
The service at Halekalani was friendly and quite good and I enjoyed the Japanese breakfast choices on the buffet.  
The beach is tiny with little surfing possible, but a breathtaking sunset on the terrace helped mitigate my overall disappointment what must have been a magical Halekalani of the 1950’s.
If I return to Hawaii, and frankly do not see the reason to spend 11 hours on the plane for the same weather and choices I can get in Miami or the Caribbean, I would return to the Halekalani, as it appears to be the last place with any semblance of elegance left on Waikiki.","Date of stay: December 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

We had been to the hotel 10 years prior but were pleasantly surprised on every level on this visit.  First and foremost the service is amazing throughout the hotel.  Check in was efficient and professional.   We had requested adjoining rooms with a roll-away in the kids room.  All was in order. When we got to the rooms the bellman rearranged the kids room to make it even more accommodating.  
Food service was equally impressive.  On our first night we dined at Orchids.  The fine hotel and resort amenity included a dinner there.  We presented the coupon and did not need to sign for a check.  Tax and gratuity included.  A nice touch.  The food is excellent and the service as well.  The same was true of the buffet breakfast.  Wonderful food.  The server brought our drinks quickly and was courteous and efficient.
Poolside service was equally attentive.  When we were seated at first there were no lounge chairs with umbrellas which we requested.  But, about an hour later an attendant offered to move us to a setting with umbrellas and a table.
Overall we were so impressed by the hospitality extended throughout the hotel, particularly in light of its location on Waikiki which one often associates with mass tourism.
One other note.  We received an invite to tea but needed to leave for the airport at 3pm when the tea service began.  I asked if we could get a tea service to go and they graciously complied.","Date of stay: December 2013","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

You won't get much bargain in Honolulu, especially for good hotel services.  For a hefty price, we got a small room with an adequate view. From our room, we could see Diamond Head and much of the ocean, but this was marred by the Sheraton.  I was not impressed by the entrance, and has to give the grand lobby at the Kahala Hotel a higher mark.  The check in was adequate and once registered, we were given a very drawn out tour of the facilities.  

The center court yard was always busy during our stay, and it seemed like endless parades of weddings.  The hotel appeared a bit tired and could use a face lift; also get rid of the no brand toiletry.  As a nice gesture, the hotel provided us with a bottle of Domaine Michelle Brut, and it was greatly appreciated.  However, this brand was a bit odd for Halekulani's caliber. Similarly priced hotels such as the Mandarin Oriental Hong Kong provides her guest(s) with Jean Louis Chaure Champagne; the Four Seasons Florence uses the local vintage of Valdo Prosecco, and the Mandarin Oriental Las Vegas serves Veuve Clicquot.  It was just odd for all the opulence and attempted elegance that this type of sparkling could be served.

The grounds are well kept, but we had to transverse the hotel to head to the gym. Low point was the pool attendant; we had to ""register"" to use the pool chair.  That sour puss ruined my quiet morning cup of coffee by the pool.  Another low light is the concierge; the recommended restaurant was extremely poor.

What Halekulani does well is the in room dining; we had breakfast in our room. the tablet was nicely set, the Halekulani pop over delicious and the attendant explained every dish in detail. The breakfast ham was possibly the best quality anywhere.  This elegant breakfast service was better than the Pierre New York and the Mandarin Oriental Atlanta.  We were quite happy and impressed.  

Other highlight was the Sunday brunch at the Orchids Restaurant; service was old school with stiff upper lips.  We also were quite mesmerized by the Hawaiian music and hula by the beach.  Valet was also first rate.  

We found this hotel very pleasant and staff strive to be the best; however, it lacks the polished service and finesse of upper echelon world class hotel.  Nevertheless, it is the best that Honolulu has to offer.  We will definitely return for our yearly Honolulu excursion.","Date of stay: October 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Having traveled extensively in Asia and Europe, often enjoying five star hotels with historic reputations, ranking the Halekulani at the five star level goes without saying.  Suffice it to note that the quality of the facility--room, restaurants, services such as the pool, fitness center, etc. all are exceptional.  What makes this hotel is simply it's staff.  Their combination of customer service, anticipation of need, unobtrusive but ever-ready response to guests' interests, and efficiency are remarkable.  The hotel's orientation toward its Japanese visitors testifies to the fact it understands cultural and social requirements to reach that culture's highest standards.  Remarkably, at the same time the staff is equally attuned to the styles of other international and American guests, providing to each the 'best of all worlds' in their experience.  Our week-long stay was excellent.  It's an expensive hotel but for those for whom expense is not an issue, one to be recommended without reservation to friends and acquaintances on their way to Honolulu.","Date of stay: October 2013","Trip type: Traveled on business","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The pictures tell a good part of the story.  I paid $500 a night for ""garden view"" room (admittedly with the prospect of getting an upgrade through my cc program).  What I'm looking at is a tile roof.  I could be anywhere in the world and wouldn't know I'm in HI.  

Background - I had booked two rooms in the area some time ago.  The Trump because it appeared to be more my style, and the Halekulani because a friend - a local - recommended it.  While on a business trip in Europe days before coming to Hawaii, I realized I had to cancel one.  I called my cc company's travel line and was on hold for 8 minutes.  At $3 a minute from Europe I figured I'd better bail and would deal with it when I got home then next day.  When I got home I called and when I reached an agent she told me - and I knew - that each property had a 72 hour cancel policy (and I was calling about 60 hours in advance).

She put me on hold and called the Halekulani and they said ""nope, if you want to cancel it's a a full night's payment as a penalty"".  (This will be material later.)  THANKFULLY the TRUMP said ""no problem"" and I canceled that room.  (That was where I wanted to go - $50 a night less, with an ocean view and a kitchen . . . )

Back to arrival.  I checked in and asked about an upgrade (which I knew in advance was ""subject to availability"").   I was told that nothing was available.  Even if I waited.  BECAUSE THEY WERE FULLY COMMITTED.  That was a point of contention . . . you're so full yet you wanted me to pay a full night's fee as a penalty to cancel the reservation???  Lousy and illogical service policy.

I got to the room and was astonished to find a room that could have been in Des Moines or Phoenix or ???.  A view out to a rooftop.  No sense at all that I was in HI.  No mini bar.  No view from floor 3. Nada.

I called down and expressed my disappointment -  the MOD wouldn't budge.  I told the tale of trying to cancel from Europe within the time frame; she went away and come back to tell me that even now she wouldn't let me out of the reservation without a penalty.  Wow.

I also had the certificate from my cc company that promised certain amenities.  The interpretation was clear to me that I was going to get x, y and z.  They said no, it meant only x and y.  I was too tired to argue.  I was stuck and unhappy.

It was even more delightful to get a note morning one indicating the possibliity of construction noise and the next morning that laundry service would be interrupted due to servicing.  Understandable, just all the more offensive.

On a positive note, the room was comfortable enough (although the bed is way too soft to suit me), and the bathroom / closet space enormous.  The grounds were nice and the food good (bfast at House Without a Key and dinner at Orchids).  Heard a fair amount of noise from adjacent rooms.  No concentrator for the hair dryer.  Fair towels.  Nice shower (water pressure and fixtures) but tiny.  This was soooooooooooo not worth it and I wouldn't recommend this property or stay here again.

This could have been an easy win on the part of the hotel.  The customer is unhappy, would like to change to another property, let her go.  Instead, the ""dig in the heels"" posture of the staff made this situation even worse.

We were escorted to our room and also given a tour of the property by a very friendly and efficient employee.  Upon arriving into our room, we immediately smelled cigarette smoke.  The employee did not even skip a beat and called the front desk to change our room immediately. We weren't given the usual excuses. We were escorted to a lovely multiply upgraded room.  The Ocean Junior Suite was just perfect with a lanai on one side and French patio(not a real Patio) on the other directly facing the ocean.It had a very comfortable king-sized bed, a bay window, free wifi, was quiet,and two bathroom sinks. Our initial room(the least expensive) was lovely too but wasn't as large, had a lanai facing the ocean at an angle but still an ample view.  You would have to stand up  on the lanai to see the ocean however but we had expected a garden/ctyd view so if the initial room had not been smoky, we would have found it acceptable.
This hotel is right on Waikiki Beach and has all the ambience that you would expect at this location. It has a very good view of Diamond Head.  It has a nightly show of Hawaiian dance and music which can be very crowded but the service is still very good for drinks or a light dinner.The hotel has the famous pool with a tiled orchid  designed into the bottom of the pool.  I thought I was going to be annoyed by the way the pool policy of basically not ""saving"" your beach chairs was going to be administered but it turned out to be just fine. .I thought I was going to have to basically ask for permission to leave my chaise lounge for a few minutes but that didn't turn out to be true. The hotel has a big-city feel  so if you like a quaint, quiet, cottagey little place, this is not the accommodation for you.
This hotel is accustomed to dealing with a fussy clientele.  The quick service for taxis, questions, checking out, etc. is excellent.
WE ate at Orchids,one of their restaurants, and were impressed by the food and service.  WE had a table right by the water.
We also had a breakfast buffet at the House Without Keys on two mornings.  My husband and I hate buffets so it's hard for me to be totally fair but the food selection was very good.  Here is where the hotel falters a bit in accommodating a big crowd.  The service was very good but not excellent and the crowded buffet was annoying.  Birds will also eat your food if you are not careful.  I believe we could have eaten off the menu in Orchids.
The hotel is in easy walking distance to the new Waikiki Beach Walk, a mega-shopping area, with high end stores.
I highly recommend this hotel and would stay here again in a heartbeat. Read House Without a Key, a Charlie Chan mystery novel, to get into the mood before your arrival.","Date of stay: October 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We have always thought that it was the best hotel in Waikiki. Not so much any more. Maybe it was the time of year (October) but it was just too busy and it seemed that the staff was overwhelmed. We counted 10 weddings over the weekend. 
Upon check in we arrived at 1:30 and they told us our room was not ready yet and that they would call our cell when the room was ready. We said fine and  proceeded to change into our swim suits which we had packed in our carry on knowing this may happen. We had to change in a poolside bathroom, they did not even offer us a place to change. We sat by the pool and never received a call. At 4PM I decided to check on our room. They said Oh yes, oops, they forgot to call. In my opinion when you are paying a premium rate for a hotel you should at least get the room on time.
We got to our room and the view was great but the room seemed tired and dirty.
The bedspread had stains on it as well as the rug.
Oh well.
I will say that even being as overwhelmed as they were the service, besides the front desk, was great. Very professional and friendly.","Date of stay: October 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

The hotel is living off its reputation of old.We should have realized things had changed when we saw the receptionists dressed in sterile office garb. Where's the aloha spirit? Room was medium-sized, average appointment, light on communication and electronic connections, missing curtains for privacy (looks right on to other balconies). The shower knobs are too high-tech, we miss the simplicity of the good ole off and on knob. However, there are lots of little pluses, like shoe buffers and lots of hangers and cosmetic goodies. No ironing board. I guess the bottom line is that  it's overpriced because of its location.  At $32 a person for the breakfast buffet, we were surprised that the selections were not larger.","Date of stay: October 2013","Trip type: Traveled on business","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

The rooms were nice, although just standard for hotel of this caliber (nothing special or surprising).  Pool is not child-friendly, the water is freezing and there is not hot tub for warming up.  The hotel otherwise is fine with kids.  Breakfast buffet is great, served where drinks and late afternoon/early evening hula dancers are located, looking out over the ocean.  Not a place to go if looking for a quiet getaway as the hustle/bustle of Waikiki is all around.  We were with our children so we did not get to sample the fancier restaurants or the spa.  Higher priced than other hotels in the area, but also probably nicer accommodations.

There was not one employee who did not display this exceptional service. We were taken to our room and explained all about the hotel and the room.  They provided a complimentary bottle of champagne when they discovered it was our wedding anniversary. Whatever we needed we received immediately. The concierge were fantastic in making dining reservations and tours.  We had a partial ocean view which they advised was upgraded to an ocean view. I must say though that if I had paid for an ocean view I would have been disappointed as the view of the ocean was only visible if I  peered sideways over the balcony. The only thing that did bother us though,  was that in their cocktail lounge in the evenings and at Orchids the restaurant,  the men were required to wear long pants. With the weather in Hawaii my husband found it a little uncomfortable to wear long pants so we consequently didn't go to these in the hotel. It was a shame and management should consider amending this rule to collared shirt and dress shorts as I heard other guests complain of the same thing. Overall though the location is excellent, there is an ABC shop just nearby where you can buy any basic items you need and also lots of restaurants and shopping close by. It was also a nice part of Waikiki away from the real busy parts. There were very few children running around. The beach itself attached to the hotel was average but good for a quick dip. The service is what makes this hotel outstanding and if you are looking to be pampered and looked after like royalty then this is the place to stay!","Date of stay: September 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

From the greeters, to the porters, to reception, to the concierge and then throughout the rest of the hotel, the level of service is fantastic.  Our room (double ocean view) was very good - not huge but the right size and spotless during the stay.  Our first week of the 2-week vacation was quiet, with very few kids but surprisingly the second week seemed to see a big influx of Australian children who were quite noisy - but still not enough to put a damper on the hotel overall.  The only small point to be aware of is that it's not possible to reserve a table for dinner at the House without a Key (onsite restaurant) which is popular for drinks with the locals and other hotels, so either be prepared to wait if you'd like to dine there or reserve at other restaurants close by (there are lots, some excellent).","Date of stay: September 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

this meant that the hotel was congested for these 3 days with queues for restaurants/booked out restaurants and a less than ideal number of sun loungers.

Service in this hotel is excellent in all respects. We ventured out of the hotel on a couple of occasions and were leased to return. 
This is certainly our pick of resort hotels in the Pacific Basin. 
We had room 1030 which was sea view not ocean front. It was very good, with a decent sea view from the balcony. I would book this wing again (not overlooking the pool) and would ask for 1030 or closer to the sea...not further back.

From our room we could see and hear the hula show at House Without a Key.  Sitting on the balcony, enjoying a mai tai, and listening to the music was a really fantastic way to end each day.  The room that we had was large enough and had good living space and closet space.  

We were out exploring and sailing during the days, but I spent many mornings watching the sunrise and drinking cups of the Halekulani's very good, complimentary Kona coffee.  The hotel's beach area is small, but also uncrowded in comparison to the neighboring Sheraton.    Most hotel guests seem to use the pool and there are plenty of lounge chairs and tables surrounding it.  Service was attentive by the pool for food and drinks.  There are no chairs on the beach.  

La Mer is a wonderful restaurant and the setting could not be better.  Our table was next to an open window looking over the ocean and hula show.  The food and cocktails were very good.  Orchids is a good dining option with nice ocean views.  Roy's is across the street from the hotel and is also a fine choice.

Halekulani does not skimp on details
if you surf, you can paddle out to three's or four's from the front of the hotel.

Things we did on property:
Slept in our room, which was small but comfortable. Tried to take a hot bath and/or hot shower but the water never got past warm. Strange thing was the sink water was boiling.

As I was not aware about a policy regarding not drinking alcohol as I was walking around, I was approached by head of security, who was rude, and inconsiderate.  He brought two security people with him, and told me “you will have to dump this beer, or leave the hotel immediately.”  He made me feel like I had just made a big mistake in staying at this Hotel.  I finished my beer, and mentioned how much money we were spending to stay there

Which averaged to $1353.06 per night, and I would like to be treated a lot better than this.  We have never been told not to drink while walking around at a hotel before in Hawaii, or anywhere for that matter, and we have stayed at the Aston, the Sheraton, the Hilton, to name a few.   So long story short, I felt like I was being restricted were I was paying lots of money to have fun.  This Hotel was not fun.  The pool closed way too early, the bar menus were way overpriced, as were the drinks.  Will I ever recommend or stay here again?  I think you know the answer to that, but in case you do not, the answer is no.

The service is excellent, plenty of options for eating and the pool area is both relaxing and by Waikiki beach standards is relatively large and comfortable. As the hotel is at the beginning of the beach strip passing pedestrian traffic is not nearly as noticeable as other Waikiki beaches which makes the resort more secluded and peaceful.

We had a room with one of the best views on the strip encompassing the entire beach looking towards Diamond Head. To step out each morning to see this view was magical. The bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom large allowing two people to move around with ease.

This was our second trip, and like the first, was a nice piece of ""paradise.""

Though only having stayed on the property once, they had our portfolio at the ready, and knew our likes and dislikes. The FOH staff was excellent, as before, but now, we were treated like `ohana (family). Though I recognized a very few from our trip, the year before, it seemed that everyone knew our names, and addressed us on every occasion. This was from the housekeeping staff, to the various restaurants. I had come to expect that from the La Mer staff, as we have dined there so many times, over the years, but even the hostess at Orchids, for breakfast, knew who we were. That amazed me, but it provoked a very warm feeling - like being part of their ""family.""

Now, the property is lovely, and tucked away from most of what one thinks of, when the location Waikiki is mentioned. It is in the middle of everything, but, at the same time, a world away. I often cite the term/expression/feeling of ""Island Time,"" but Halekulani personifies that term. It is both casual, and elegant. Grand, but homey. Definitely a luxury resort, but feeling rather like home. In short, a wonderful combination of attributes, and some that seem almost to be paradoxes. The best of many worlds.

Our first room was a suite, overlooking the Pacific, with a lovely lanai. This time, we were in the interior of the property, right over the spa, with a more ""distant"" view of the ocean, but lovely, in its own right. It was large, well-appointed, very comfortable and quite, though opening onto an interior courtyard.

The staff is very attentive and does a great job of anticipating a guest's needs.

Dining is fabulous, starting with either the breakfast buffet, or a full menu at Orchids. The Sunday Brunch at Orchids is not to be missed. This is a ""dress up"" brunch, and a jacket for a gentleman, while not required, will not be out character. The ladies don their hats, and some their gloves. Children wear nice dresses and blazers plus ties. They are not out of place.

La Mer is the signature restaurant, and is perhaps the ultimate fine-dining experience on O`ahu. The cuisine is a combination of Hawai`ian and classic French, and the wine list is fantastic, and has world-class depth. Until recently with The Vintage Cave, it was the finest in all of Hawai`i. It is also one of the most expensive restaurants on O`ahu.

Orchids is only a small step down. It's open for breakfast (full menu), lunch, Sunday Brunch, and dinner.

Then, there is HWAK (House Without a Key), that has a great pool patio, with drinks, wines, pu`pus and some of the best live Hawai`ian performances anywhere - La Mer has a few tables that overlook the stage.

Halekulani truly lives up to its name - ""House Befitting Heaven""

I can't say that this wasn't a taste of Heaven above!  We had a ocean front deluxe room and it was absolutely fantastic!  The views, the in-room amenities, the outlay of the guest room, the attention to detail were all perfect.

We were told this was a 5 star hotel and we were indeed treated as if it were a 5 star hotel.  We were not disappointed at all!

The way the service staff treated you, the way you were treated in the dining room, the attention to every detail, the housekeeping staff keeping your room immaculate, from refreshing the sheets daily, to providing extra towels each day, the way the staff remembered your names in the restaurants were all wonderful.

Definitely try out the ""House Without the Key Lounge.""  It is not to be missed.  You will enjoy one of the most exciting and intimate bars in all of of the islands.  The drinks are the best in the islands.  It has the bet Mai Tai of anywhere I have ever tasted.

Of all the hotels on Waikiki this one is the very best.  You couldn't pick a better location.  If  you get anxious and need to get out and do some shopping you can leave room and walk two blocks and be in the center of the shopping district.  Once again the location is perfect.

I have stayed in other ""on the beach hotels"" in Hawaii and compared to the Halekulani, the others are noisy, overrun with spoiled and bratty children.  You will NOT find that at the Halekuliani.

For a peaceful, quiet relaxed vacation, definitely head to the Halekulani!  It is a wonderful 5 star hotel with a 5 star service and the most detailed personal service anywhere!

I was traveling alone and felt safe at the hotel the entire time there is a lot of security on the grounds. I was always greeted by my name and housekeeping was so kind. The pool staff was attentive but not overly attentive to where you felt bothered.

Whilst it was certainly a large hotel you didn't feel like you shared it with hundreds of others. There was always a space to relax which wasn't too crowded and the service was always at tentative.
The rooms were really well appointed and the twice daily fresh water and ice service was a welcome and elegant touch. It was always a pleasure to come back to the room after dinner in the hotel to find the beds turned down and water refreshed, ready for a refreshing nights sleep on truly good mattresses with probably the best pillows I've ever slept on. 
The formality of the hotel meant one didn't see too many children at dinner at night. Dinner in one of the 3 restaurants, all of which catered to one's individual needs, from relaxed to formal. A very nice touch. The food was certainly better than other hotels I've stayed in. 
One particular pleasure was Terry, the bar man, in l'Aperatif a la Mer, who night after night was a delight with his stories of his experiences of 30 years having worked there.
This is not a cheap hotel, let's be clear, but you certainly get what you pay for and I can't wait to get back. All staff is friendly without being intrusive, incredibly helpful, and very knowledgeable. one would always be acknowledged when encountering staff in halls or other public places.

True, it's expensive (which explains our all-too-brief stays, but I'd rather stay a couple of days in a truly excellent hotel than a week in something disappointing; it's what memories are made of).","Date of stay: July 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I felt immediately at ease, and you immediately escape the hussel and bussel of Waikiki. I met Frank the manager on that morning and he graciously showed me around the hotel and up to La Mer, giving me some insite and history into the Halekulani. I was advised the hotel was fully booked but my husband continued to try right up until 11am the day of our wedding to secure a room for our wedding night. He managed to get a stunning room, which I was very impressed with. After viewing other hotels in the area of similar value Halekulani stands out as an acceptional experience.

We have oceanfront interconnecting rooms and we requested the same rooms we had last year and were granted them which was a real bonus. Service at this hotel is excellent, it is understated luxury, yes it's not cheap but the best hotel in Waikiki. Breakfast excellent, pool service excellent, concierge excellent. The only downside for us is the gym is too small and there is no games room, or any other facility for kids, even a ping pong table would be good.

The vibe here is always peaceful, with understated luxury.  The breakfast is very good.  Everything is kept very clean and tidy.  

The service is stellar, the best, in all areas.  Pool service is especially wonderful.  Many of the guests here are Japanese, and everyone is very polite and well behaved- no obnoxious kids running around the pool (I did see a few kids, however, they were all very well-behaved and you hardly knew they were there).

If you want a relatively 'low key' experience of Waikiki, look no further than the  Halekalani. It's the sort of hotel that makes you feel really well looked after and a little bit away from the touristy aspects of Waikiki. The staff were fantastic in attending to our needs while we stayed here. In fact, one example of this was when my partner left his 'dream' wish to drive a convertible along the coast, to the last minute, and the night before we were to take this drive, he decided to rent a Mustang. Googling the rental places, my partner could find nothing left to rent for the next day, he then decided to ring concierge. This was about 6 p.m. Unfortunately at such late notice they said, they could only offer him his second choice of favorite cars, a big jeep rental. He was happy enough. The next morning,on going down to concierge to sign the insurance papers and pick up the car, the lovely woman Wendy?,  I think her name was, said many apologies gentlemen, there has been a mix up, the Jeep's not here, but here are the keys to your white mustang (M's favourite colour). He and I couldn't have been more thrilled! The concierge had remembered what car M really had wanted, and managed somehow to get it for him. It was really wonderful service, above and beyond.. Special mention for hospitality also has to go to Casey, who worked poolside, who was super friendly and attentive, as well as all the staff at Le Mer. Actually, the experience of Le Mer was one of the best dining experiences of my life. It was incredibly beautiful there, at the best table of the restaurant, with the tropical rain coming down, and the palm trees silhouetted on the beach, it felt like I was in some kind of magical dream. ( And to think, after reading too many of the reviews on Trip Advisor, I nearly cancelled my reservation here). 
I actually loved the tiny beach out the front of the hotel and thought the pool and surrounding area wonderful for lying around  and relaxing.
To sum up, and quote a Honolulu taxi driver, this hotel,  situated alongside the many other hotels that board the hordes of tourists that come to Waikiki every year, is a diamond in the rough.","Date of stay: June 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We had a suite overlooking Diamondhead and the ocean.  The view was spectacular!  The common grounds were well maintained and as pretty as we remembered.  The food was good and the service, attentive.  What bothered us was that for the money, we thought that the inside of the hotel should have been maintained better.  The plumbing was shotty.  We got bursts of hot and cold water all the time while showering and though they tried to fix it, the problem persisted.  The ""engineer"" admitted that it was the plumbing.  My guess is that they already knew that but the staff can only apologize and offer ""treats"" to compensate.  Only the owners can fix the plumbing.  Also, in the bathroom, the glass shelves that once held amenities, now wobble precariously, spilling anything on top of them, unless one is very careful.  Staples stuck out of the carpet where rooms met.  We could hear all kinds of noises from other rooms and outside, from the events going on below, (until about midnight).  This is supposed to be the quiet hotel in Waikiki.  The balcony was not a place to sit out on the terrace and eat because the protected birds would drop their excrements on you and your food constantly.  However, the rooms are nicely appointed.  -Small showers and doorways but lovely neutral decor.  One elevator was broken during our stay, so there were long lines to go up and down.  Still, management attempts to stay on top of the hotel's problems.  I think they just need some help from the owners.","Date of stay: May 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

DECOR
Understand end elegance allowing the ocean and palms to be showcased.

CLEANLINESS
The hotel is extremely clean. 

CHECK IN
We were escorted to our room by the front desk staff, who explained the resort grounds, restaurants meals times, and all the amenities in the room.

SECURITY
Since the hotel is on the beach, security is necessary to keep out non-Halekulani patrons. The bathrooms next to the beach can only be opened with a room. The hotel elevators (when going up) can only be activated with the room key (but when coming down from your room you don't need the key to activate the elevator).  We loved this level of security. You are paying a lot of money to stay at this hotel and don't want anyone to be able to run a muck in it.

ROOMS
Although we booked a garden view too to save money, we stayed on the 7th floor and from the left of our balcony we are ocean front. So, Halekulani classifies rooms that don't directly face the ocean as non-ocean front even though I drank morning coffee looking at the water (I just turned the lounger on the balcony a little and the entire view is ocean).  
The rooms are equipped with high tech features.  Night stands have power strips to plug in electronic devices.  One side of the bed has a standing remote that shuts off every light in the room from bed! The private and maid service is a light you turn on inside the room and glows outside. No pesky ""do not disturb"" signs to hang.  The bed is comfortable (we had a king) and there is a sofa, coffee table, swiveling flat panel sony TV, and end of bed bench in the room.
The bathroom has the closet, a plunge tub, a glass shower, separate toilet room and a chair at the vanity to sit while primping.  There are daily robes and slippers in the room.
Maid service comes twice a day to make up the room and again at night for turndown service.  Each morning before maid service a daily newspaper is hanging on your door. Nightly maid service leaves you a small gift each evening with beautiful cards.

ROOM SERVICE DINING
Absolutely spectacular. I've traveled the world and this is the best I've seen. Always brought to you on a wheeled-in table, the waiter sets the table for you. Food is kept in a hot box underneath the table and taken out hot when the table is being set. We got breakfast one morning and the waiters set up a toaster so the bread could be freshly toasted.  Tax and gratuity are included in room dining and the waiter always lets you know that.  We ate dinner in bed one night and the waiter extends the table to come to the bed and another time we had breakfast on the sofa and the waiter rearranged the room for it.  Room service can also be set onto balcony by the waiter. Wonderful!!

FOOD/DRINK
Dining is expensive here but absolutely worth it! The Sunday brunch buffet at Orchids (resort attire, collared shirts for men) is exceptional (approx $60pp) and features both standard American breakfast as well as Japanese (sushi rolls,etc).  House Without a Key (resort casual attire, bathing suits and cover ups are just fine) has nightly live Hawaiian music and another menu of excellent food.  Le Mer (resort dressy,collared shirts, tie/jacket optional) is exquisite.  The service at all dining establishments is premiere.  The drinks match the food and service.

LOCATION 
Perfection! The quite of the Ocean mixed with the upscale shopping outside of the hotel make for both a relaxing and entertaining experience. You can nearly walk to everything!

POOL
The pool may look small but it is not. There are very few families with children here. I think it is just to expensive for a family. The pool is always calm and roomy.  The poolside service is great. Drinks keep coming and poolside food is nearly the same menu as the lunch menu for House without a Key.  One negative: will have to get to the pool early so secure loungers with umbrellas. Pool opens at 7:00am daily and you really need to be there at 7 to get an umbrella. The staff will tell you that they cannot hold you loungers while you leave for breakfast so if your plan is to secure loungers and take off, you are taking a chance (but I never saw anyone have a problem!) drink service starts at approx 10:30am and concludes around 5pm.  Pool closes at 7pm daily.

OCEAN
The beach is very small but still beautiful. There are no loungers on the sand. Access to the beach is right next to the pool and there is walkway to walk along the beach without being in the water.  Later in the day, at high tide, the waves will crash against the barrier wall of the pool patio. The sound is beautiful.

For us, the service has been average at best and certainly well below what we've experienced at similar class properties around Hawaii and the world (e.g., Four Seasons, Ritz-Carlton, Banyan Tree, Palace Hotel Tokyo). We've visited Hawaii often (this being at least our 7th time) and understand service can sometimes be laid-back, but we wouldn't expect that at the Halekulani based on the reviews we've read on TA and our experience at other fine Hawaiian hotels.

The Good - (1) the spa is top class with excellent technicians.  Fantastic massages and facials.
(2) Comfortable bed
(3) Joy's Special sandwich - crabmeat, bacon & avocado on whole wheat bread...need I say more?
(4) Tasty Mai Tais

The Bad - except for one waiter at the outside bar, service was slow or almost non-existent.  During our day at the pool, we lounged for an hour (11-12 noon) without ever seeing a server so we decided to eat at the pool-side restaurant.  After a slow (""leisurely"" if I'm kind) lunch, we finally saw a server at the pool and were able to order drinks.  However, after 1 follow up visit, our server never came back until I signaled her for our check about 90 minutes later (full disclosure: she had a 30 min lunch break during the start of this time, but none of her colleagues covered her area and she never stopped by after her break).  It was clear that they were under-staffed at the pool area.

The Ugly - (1) the Halekulani has dress codes throughout much of the property, which is fine, but seems a bit over the top given the hotel's location.  One evening after dinner, we asked the concierge where we could get a nightcap drink.  She directed us to the jazz bar even though she could plainly see that I was wearing dress shorts, collared shirt and sandals while the club requires long pants and close-toed shoes (in Hawaii!).  It would have been better for her to be upfront with us about the dress code and direct us to another bar in the area.

(2) You need to carry your room key in order to use the restroom at the pool.  There was an attendant who let my wife and me into the restrooms, but she scolded my wife for being wet and ""drippy"" going into the restroom (AT THE POOL!) and me for not having my room key even though I did have it, but I just thought the room was occupied.  Having never before experienced a secured pool restroom, I didn't know I needed a higher security clearance than Edward Snowden to use the toilet.  Consider me educated now.

For some reason, when you turn the TV on, the volume is set very high.  Strange.","Date of stay: June 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

Loved the breakfast everyday in such a gorgeous setting.

By far and away, the best hotel in Waikiki is the Halekulani. We have visited it on several occasions. Our latest trip this month was as delightful as ever. I planned a surprise visit by my daughter and her partner from New York. A second room was booked in my name, and it was vital that my husband wasn't alerted to its existence. Although I had emailed the hotel to ask them not to disclose the surprise, I was naturally concerned that it would be spoilt. Not so, as the staff were primed by notes on their computer at check-in. This example is indicative of the Halekulani style - if you request something, they have the willingness and procedures in place to follow through. In addition, we were welcomed back to the Halekulani no less than three times before we were escorted to our room. Small, personal touches such as these not only make you feel extremely welcome, but build loyalty. During this visit, we had adjoining Diamond Head rooms on the tenth floor. They were perfect - well equipped, beautifully decorated, and with magnificent views! If at all possible, the hotel has improved since our last visit. Each staff member greets you when they see you around the hotel, the facilities are top-notch and the service at all restaurants and shops is exceptional. Food and drinks are also of a high quality. The pool staff are friendly and helpful and the pool area and grounds are exceptional. In short, this hotel is divine! My daughter and I treated ourselves to two spa treatments. The spa is delightful and the staff are friendly and knowledgeable. Although expensive by many standards, for a holiday treat, the spa treatments are worth every cent.

Probably the best hotel I have stayed at. it was probably the honey moon spirit in me, but I stayed 3 nights prior and after Maui where I stayed at the Ritz Carlton and this hotel was great. 

It is hard to say this one was better because it is a different hotel but if we have to choose one this was the best one. Everyone in the hotel offers great service and goes the extra mile. They are always mindful of your needs and are very accomodating. Our room was pristine, fresh, modern and we were treated with a bottle of wine because of our honeymoon. The hotel restaurants are great and if you feel like buying a Chanel purse or 5kUSD cufflinks, you are in the right spot! (We did not buy anything haha but it was nice to see). 

You are greeted when checking in your room with fruit and chocolate which if you just flew 6hours on Coach, you greatly appreciate! :) 

One comment we received from a photographer in the mall close by was that the Halekulani is able to offer a better service because of their headcount, he said. Apparently they have a higher ratio of employees to guests than many other hotels like the Royal HAwaiian. Of course, I did not take a trip to the HR department of both hotels and asked for the headcount so I have no way of knowing if there is any foundation for this. What I can definitely say is that service is great, either becuase employees are superhuman or because there are so many of them. If you ask me I do not really care, what I do and did care about was that I felt so great that I will be back some day.","Date of stay: April 2013","Trip type: Traveled on business","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We had a room on one of the higher floors that overlooked the pool and of course the ocean. It is an exclusive hotel, with pretty gardens and pool area which are only accessible by hotel guests so there are not lots of people rushing around the place. It was great to just relax around the pool area. All very civilised. You have the pool staff setting up your sun chairs for you and the recommendation to not disturb other guests with mobile phones as well as a reasonable dress code in the evenings. It was just right so that you had a great peaceful restful stay and a touch of elegance.

The staff were all wonderful from arrival to departure and everywhere else on the hotel premises.

Our room was fine with a balcony and great views, the only thing about it is that i felt that it could have been a little more modern. It is my first time to Hawaii so perhaps it is the style of the area, i just thought it might have been a little more modern for the price i was paying.

It was in walking distance to main shopping area and waikiki beach area. We enjoy walking so it was convenient in that way.

Breakfast was fine, the normal fair you would expect in a 5 star hotel, but i do spend a lot of time in asia and it is hard to beat the breakfasts in asian 5 star hotels. They are the best in the world. A little expensive if you add it on as an extra cost, rather than part of your bed and breakfast package.

So if you like the exclusive feel , this is definitely the place to stay. It was a touch more expensive than I think it should be, but i do love the hotel and would stay there again.","Date of stay: May 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

A while back we stayed at this hotel for a seven day holiday and paid thousands of dollars for a prime Diamond Head view room.  We enjoyed their restaurants and views very much but I was appalled by the security guards acts of racial discrimination.  Whenever I walked back to my room, I was watched with a look of suspicion and on one occasion even followed up to my floor by a security guard.  He watched me until I walked into my room!  I was hurt by the inference that I didn't belong and I was a committing a crime.  I am part Hawaiian and I have darker skin.  If I were a Japanese national or white, I would not have been treated this way.  I will never stay there again.  I recently stayed at the Kahala Resort and was treated like royalty there!

The ambiance is essentially perfect for a luxury vacation, or, say, a honeymoon.  I stayed in a Diamond Head view room and it was wonderful.  There are a couple of things which you should be aware of, particularly if you are here on business.

1) This is not a business hotel.  The amenities you expect, pressing, even a coffee maker in the room (!) are missing.  Again, if you are here on business, this would probably be a strange choice anyway.

2) The room was crazy expensive for what the size and amenities.  The room was around $900 per night.  This is not the high season.  I expected it to be much larger than it was.  It was quite small - well appointed and very well located, but extremely expensive for what it is.  

The concierge was awesome and recommendations were perfect.  Again, great execution and premium price all around.","Date of stay: May 2013","Trip type: Traveled on business","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I was really pleased with our decision, and the Halekulani was a big part of that reason. The hotel is not ""drop dead"" fabulous as you go in, but the quiet elegance and quality become apparent quite shortly. 

Our Diamond Head view room was not large for three persons, but it was very high quality, with a very comfortable bathroom. What made it quite bearable, however, was the fabulous balcony and killer view. We were lucky enough to have a balcony that had a high degree of privacy because the hotel jutted out a little further on the right side, which gave us the ability to be out  there without anyone really overlooking us. I would definitely inquire as to whether one of these types of rooms was available should I check in again. And I loved sitting out there day or night and watching the passing scene on Waikiki. Our housekeeping service was flawless and prompt, which is another big plus for this hotel. 

The restaurants at this property are top notch. I could have been happy eating only at the hotel. The House Without  a Key was a great casual venue. We had a good lunch and dinner there, and their drinks are great. Only downside is that the evening entertainment only lasted until 9 p.m., and I would have been happy to sit out there listening to Hawaiian music much later. 

The Orchids restaurant is a step up in quality and atmosphere. Such a pleasant patio. Very reminiscent, for us, of some great Asian hotel. Absolutely cannot recommend the breakfast here highly enough. The madacamia nut pancakes with coconut sauce were so good, and didn't drown you in sugar. All the baked goods were super high quality, and the service was wonderful. We were here on an American Express Platinum rate, and could have had the all-you-can-eat breakfast at House WIthout a Key as well, but Orchids was just too wonderful. The building in which Orchids is located is just a lovely venue, with a gorgeous lounge area and La Mer restaurant is located upstairs. We didn't eat there, but it looked beautiful.

I actually loved the whole relaxed and elegant pace at the Halekulani. It definitely insulates you from the masses at Waikiki, and that is welcome! The only other place I would consider staying in this area is the Royal Hawaiian, as that is so unique, but it would be hard to pass up the Halekulani should we return. Definitely a relaxing and wonderful way to reacquaint myself with Honolulu. Now if United hadn't made us 4 hours late on our return, the trip would have been perfect.","Date of stay: April 2013","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Check in was quick and easy and as we were early our room wasn't ready.  When we returned later, we were escorted to our room where the staff member carefully explained how everything worked and where to find everything.  Our ocean front room was spotlessly clean and looked out over the pool to Waikiki beach.  The room looked exactly like the ones on the hotel website, decorated in soft muted tones of pale blues, greys and white.  Shortly after, our luggage arrived and not long after that, a bottle of champagne.  There was also a plate of tropical fruit and signature chocolates waiting for us.  Turn down service was probably the best we have ever experienced.  Not only was the bed turned down and fresh towels provided, but also the ice bucket was filled, bottled water replenished, low lights turned on, remote control and room service menu placed on the bed and a small gift was left on the table. Just lovely!

We had booked the sunrise package which included breakfast daily.  We ate at the buffet at House Without a Key one morning which was the most beautifully displayed selection I have ever seen.  There was also an omelette station cooking to order.  The next two days we enjoyed breakfast at Orchids which is a la carte.  The scrambled eggs with lobster was a decadent treat.  The whole experience of a silver service breakfast was very relaxing and just beautiful.

We enjoyed drinks on our lanai in the evening and watched the entertainment down below us.  We had dinner at House Without a Key on one of their grill evenings which was upmarket casual but relaxing.  Dinner at Orchids was without a doubt, the best of our entire trip.  We both had scallops and I had opah with pork and my husband had the veal chop.  We then shared the famous coconut cake.  I don't always have dessert, but I could happily eat this cake every day for a long, long time - it really is that good. Service was impeccable and the evening was worth the expense.

Overall, the Halekulani is an elegant retreat away from the busy, noisy Waikiki.  Everything seems quieter, slower and more refined here and we cannot recommend it highly enough.","Date of stay: April 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The rooms are a little small, so don’t be shocked that they are smaller than the average room these days. We got upgraded to a Diamond Head room as we booked with Amex. I was expecting a better room, because of the large nightly fee paid, but all in all it was a nice way to start out honeymoon.

Very sad to see some guests who leave their rooms at 7 am to place towels everyday at the exact same spot around the pool. No class; or, if any, third. Food was excellent in the dining room; jackets are required even for lunch. The more informal restaurants are good too. The pool attendants are professional; the general manager was very accommodating for special request that we made.

This was our first trip to Hawaii and we did a lot of research about where to stay but this hotel far exceeded our expectations. We felt so special here and the warmth from staff at all levels was genuine.

We booked through Amex and on arrival we were upgraded to a partial ocean view room which was just beautiful. The outlook owas over both the pool area and out to the ocean. As preferred we were given our two double beds and there was ample space in the closet for two people. Decor is fresh, bright and simple. It was a pleasure to be in the room.

The ambience of the grounds and the pool area are so peaceful and serene but also luxurious and glamorous. The pool is lit up beautifully at night and we very much enjoyed the bands that played in the House with a Key.  Service by the pool was outstanding. We were not left long to wait for drinks or food. Eric the waiter was very charming and helpful!

Breakfast was included in our room rate which is good value. The omlette stand was a highlight. It was so gorgeous sitting out in the sunshine looking at Diamond Head to start the day.

We dined at all three resturants: House without a Key (great for casual fare and sunset cocktails) - best MAI TAIs in Hawaii and we tried all of them; Orchids was a nice choice - I enjoyed a nice steak there and tried the famous coconut cake dessert (very light and delicious); La Mer was outstanding in terms of ambience and food. We tried the tasting menu which was subtle and delicious. My fish was so fresh and delcious. The souffle dessert was out of this world! The resteraunt looks over the ocean and the atmosphere is very romantic. Great for a special occasion!

On Wednesday nights guests are invited for cocktails and canapes on the the Hau Terrace. Gorgeous view and a lovely atmosphere - don't miss this.

The spa was probably the best experience I've ever had at a spa anywhere. My friend and I had a massage together and everything was in sync. The foot massage ritual was a nice start and the massage itself was very good. The little orchid placed under the massage table meant you had something nice to look at which was a great touch. Afterwards you can relax on the lanai and the little mochi they brought us with our tea were delicious!

We also had our hair done afterwards which was great. The ladies there were so funny and friendly. Really appreciated having the hair salon on hand!

Service as a general thing was just incredible - nothing was too much trouble! The little gifts left in the room, the way the door staff remembered us and help us with our copious shopping bags, organsing a private island tour with a great driver.

The hotel is a little further away from the main shopping area but you can walk there. We tended to take taxis which we always got straight away.

Our time at Halekulani was magical, all of the staff we encounted during our stay could not have been more helpful, whether room service, housekeeping, concierge, valet, reception or restaurants, we were always greeted in a most friendly way and quite often by name as well.
Our room was fabulous, very roomy, comfortable bed, excellent bathroom and what a view!!
Our room was on the 17th floor looking towards Diamond Head, absolutely marvellous.
We ate in both House without a key and Orchids, food and service in both excellent.

Valets such as Curtis  miraculously ensure bags are delivered to your room at the same time you do.  Check-in is done in the room.  What a civilized way to welcome guests.  We were helped with some of the friendliest servers at House Without a Key. We got to know Cindy who actually brought us home grown mangoes to share.  The property is low-key and not over the top.  A semi-private part of the beach offers guests with a bit of privacy.  Service at the pool is FANTASTIC and bar-none.  In my opinion, service at this hotel is the golden standard for ALL properties claiming to be ""resorts"".  Oh, and they have a fantastic manager's reception each Wednesday night to welcome all guests in their ballroom over looking the ocean with small snacks and drinks.

Booked through Amex Fine Hotels.  Our travel agent made a point to tell the properties that we are staying at that it was a special trip.  I was hoping they would make some nice gesture for my wife during our stay.

Check in was boring and clumsy.  No lei, no flower for my wife, no glass of juice or champagne.  Just directed to front desk.  Escorted up to room by front desk girl to a room with two double beds pushed together.  Told her we had a king guarantee.  Sat in room for ten minutes waiting for her to get an answer and finally I told her we would go down to House Without a Key for a drink and she could come see me when room issue figured out.  No effort to buy our drinks.  Eventually assigned a king.

Room small but nicely furnished.  Bathroom nice but shower too small for a grown man.  Nice lanai.  No mini bar but bottled water in room.  Canned check in amenity of wrapped fruit and some chocolates.  Underwhelmed for $600 plus a night.

One big plus was conceirge.  They were great.  Arranged a rental car that was delivered to hotel.  Helped with dinner, transports.  5 stars for their effort

Dinner at Orchids very nice.  After my wife and I had dessert and coffee the manager brought by a piece of cocoanut cake for our anniversary.  We thanked him and told him we just finished dessert and he put it in a bag for us.

Drinks and music at Room w/out was great.  Band is a father and two of his grown daughters and they were great.  Alot of fun.

I had drinks at this place 10 years ago before I could afford it.  Now that I can, I am not sure I would do it again.  Especially since the public can come listen to the music.  I think I will do the Trump next time or skip Waikiki altogether.","Date of stay: April 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Lots of good things about the hotel: the service is excellent, particularly the concierge; our ocean view room was great, beautifully appointed with awesome views and in great condition; breakfast at House Without A Key was exceptional, a really good buffet in a nice location; awesome location right on the beach and close to town. All of these were promised and delivered, as they should be for the price. 
The hotel is largely occupied by Japanese getting married, I must have seen 7 brides a day, they are beautiful and very nice people and, older rich people. I say this because it is not a particularly lively hotel or one for families, nor does it pretend to be. The pool is an old, but beautifully maintained small oval one, with no swim up bar it does however, have great service. I have four teenage children and I would not bring them here, it is not a hotel for families.
The hotel has three restaurants. The middle one is Orchids, I was dismayed to find that whilst on holiday I must wear long pants, not interested. Further if you choose to have breakfast there, which you can, you have a budget of $31 a head, that should be plenty but it's not when juice is $8 and I got charged $15 for a triple espresso. That said, the other buffet for breakfast is excellent.
In summary, this is a beautiful hotel, with exceptional service at a very steep price. It is perfect for some however, I won't be returning.","Date of stay: April 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

He looked in the closet near the desk where they usually keep some and it was empty.

Went immediately to the Halekulani  for the breakfast buffet, and was quickly restored.  

The best location on Waikiki, plus a very reasonably priced (and always excellent) breakfast buffet.  I go for the traditional - fruit, pastry, waffles, omelets; however, the Japanese  entrees all look good, too.  Plates are cleaned from the table before you're back from your second visit to the buffet.  The wait staff is very attentive - your glass is refilled before you notice it's half-empty, and a bird basket is placed over any plate you're still working on, so the sparrows don't get to it.  

Great for sundowners, too - the best hula in a hotel setting, and a Mai Tai that packs a punch (much more than any other Mai Tai I've had in Honolulu for many years.)

The staff at the Halekulani is the most professional staff I've seen at any hotel in the US.  Friendly, courteous, eager to help no matter how much time it takes (I walked in one time, asked the reception desk for help finding a camera store, and immediately had three people on the desk working their computers to try to locate one for me - and I wasn't a guest at the hotel.)

Last but not least, the parking is the best deal in Honolulu.

We arrived at noon and said our room was ready (ocean front), but if we were willing to wait to 3pm, they would upgrade us to a Diamond Head Ocean Front.

After relaxing by the pool and at the restaurant House with a Key, our room was ready.  The room was gorgeous and definitely worth the wait.

By booking through AMEX, we received complimentary breakfast (either at Orchids or House without a Key), a free dinner at Orchids, and late check out.

Breakfast was buffet style at House without a Key, and a la Carte at Orchids.  We preferred Orchids (try their Lobster Scrambled Eggs and puffed pastry).    The Orchids dinner was Prix Fixe but still quite a nice bonus. House without a Key has nightly entertainment, as well the Lewer's Lounge.

The next day was a little overcast, so we decided to do a couples massage.  It was definitely a relaxing experience.

The hotel concierge was wonderful in planning our activities, and helped us plan our drive around the island with good stopping points and restaurants along the way.

We were always greeted and chatted up by the valet staff, who had helpful little pointers about Oahu and the culture.

The only downside is the beach, which is on the smallest strip of Waikiki.  The good news is that the beachwalk will get you to the best part in a few minutes.

The great thing about this resort is that it is on Waikiki but also feels like its a tranquil hidden gem away from it all.  We would definitely stay again.","Date of stay: January 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Most of that was definitely true - compared to the other Waikiki hotels we visited - most of which seem stuck in the 70s or 80s-  Halekulani is elegant, serene, and with great service.  The pool area is nice, breakfast buffet delicious, and the room while not large was well appointed and with a great view of Waikiki (at an extra charge).  The only issues we had were some noise problem at night.  One night there was some sort of machinery making noises around 11pm that was irritating although didn't last long.  The other was at about 1am one night when we heard a consistent banging.  We called the front desk and they were able to stop it - turns out someone was locked out of their room and for some reason decided to keep banging on his door instead of going down to the front desk.

I have since then moved to California but really wanted to get married at home.

I actually looked at several other venues prior to halekulani but was not impressed. The catering staff was not knowledgeable and didn't explain the menus or packages. It was only after visiting all other hotels did I finally decide to visit halekulani. I initially neglected the hotel because I thought it would be out of my price range. But I'm so glad I stopped by. 

A couple of key points that made this an awesome venue:

-I no longer live in Hawaii (so this is a destination wedding) so all communication with the banquet manager was done via email.  Which I loved because it saved alot of time. They were very responsive and answered all my questions. I never had to follow-up with them once.

-the hotel is 5 star. It is classy, elegant and has the open air plantation feel. It is very different compared to other hotels in Waikiki. While other hotels plow people thru, you feel at ease in the hotel. It is very quiet. 

-their wedding packages are awesome. If you spend over 6k in food, they will hook you up with a free hotel room for your wedding night (champagne and all). Package also includes a wedding cake!  They provide cake cutting tools and there is no cake cutting fee. Valet is free for all your guests. If you add up all the little details, halekulani ends up being cheaper than most of the other venues in Waikiki. Oh forgot to mention, if you spend 6k on food, they waive the ceremony location fee - for my location, that saved me over $2500!

-you cannot beat the service. Everyone...from the reception, to the bell boy, to the wait staff will treat you like you are a millionaire. They all give 5 star service. They will go out of their way to make your stay comfortable. I've never felt like such a queen and my guests also commented how they were very attentive.

-the food is good. All my guests were pleased with the food and drinks. I had 4 course meals and the average price was about $75/person. You also don't need to feel like you are stuck with their set food menus. You can mix and match and they will reprice accordingly.

-You cannot beat the view. I got married on the Hau terrace which overlooks the ocean. Absolutely stunning. All of our guests, even the locals, thought that the view belonged in a magazine.

Definitely check it out. It was by far my best wedding decision. My only regret was that I could not stay there for longer...","Date of stay: March 2013","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

You can even walk 15 mins to the ala moana sopping centre if you want to. The house without a key is great for a drink or dinner but get their prior to 6pm as this place gets packed as everyone from all the other hotels comes here as this is the place to watch sunset.

Went to the Four Seasons on the Big Island last year and it was amazing.  Wanted to go back but prices doubled in one year, so decided to try Oahu since it was more similar to what we'd paid last year ($700/night).  Seemed from our research than Halekulani was the best Oahu had to offer, so we booked.  The good:  Our room overlooking Waikiki Beach and Diamond Head in the background; I signed up for The Leaders Club prior to booking and we got upgraded to a special room at no cost; the entertainment at sunset/happy hour is quintessential Honolulu, concierge desk when I asked for assistance was very helpful and courteous, the choice of breakfasts in either Orchids or Room Without a Key were terrific...Orchids had a nice menu, Room had an extensive buffet...really nice for being included in the room rate fully, our ocean view room had a roomy balcony for sunset cocktails and morning coffee with beautiful views, when we arrived downstairs for sunset cocktails at 6:15 they were already very crowded, but they somehow found front row seats for the entertainment on two nights for us (was it our Leaders' Club membership?), the individual rooms and the customized service in the spa are very special.  Cons:  Service was not quite up to par for a hotel this expensive.  When we checked in, they took my credit card data and asked us to wait until someone could accompany us to our room (we just wanted a key).  We waited for 15 minutes until the receptionist was available.  Next, the poolside bar was just OK.  The cocktails on the pool menu were not that tasty and when we asked for something off the menu, the results were disappointing.  Next, we had dinner at La Mer on our last night.  The decor and service were definitely better than anything we had experienced in Hawaii before, but the food was just mediocre, and the dinner tab for 2 was about $475, turn down service took place at 5:00 when we were just wanting to take a nap before happy hour.","Date of stay: February 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

You either love it, or hate it.  If you want to experience the best of this part of Hawaii, then look no further than the Halekulani.  Rooms: had an oceanfront on the 11th floor and it exceeded my expectations.  Very clean with great linens, balcony, view, housekeeping, bathroom (would have liked a second sink), and toiletries. Pool chairs were crowded (pool temp was perfect) - but given that this is Waikiki and the hotel was near full occupancy, I was satisfied with the service and availability.  Just bring a little patience and relax.  Walk next door to the Sheraton's pool area and oceanfront restaurants - and you'll quickly realize just how fortunate you are to have picked the Halekulani!  Spa was tiny and disappointing for the #1 property in Waikiki, with no steam/sauna/jacuzzi facilities (not even a jacuzzi out by the main pool).  Grounds were beautiful and well maintained.  Vibe: It was a little formal-feeling in the evenings (with a pretentious sign in the lobby reminding evening visitors to wear appropriate attire), but I always felt comfortable no matter what time of the day or night it was.  Food: only ate there for breakfast at HWAK.  Very, very good - food and service.  Drinks and service by the pool were great, and the prices were in line with what you'd expect at a top-end hotel like this. Nothing outrageous.  Location: about the best you can get in downtown Honolulu, with maybe a couple of hundred dining options within a 10-15 minute walk of the front door.  Some great shopping nearby too if you are into that.   I have stayed in several different hotels in Waikiki during my visits over the years (this was my first stay here) - but the Halekulani will be my hotel of choice in Waikiki from now on.","Date of stay: February 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Our first impression was that the Halekulani was not a five star hotel. After staying at the MO in Paris and London, Ritz Carlton's in Puerto Rico, the Breakers in Palm Beach, The Beverly Hills Hotel and many other amazing hotels we were terribly disappointed in the room.  After we settled in and recovered from the 15+ hour trip we realized just how special this Hotel was.

The service is exceptional. Pool service, porters, housekeeping, wait staff and concierge are at the top of their game. We ate breakfast at the hotel each day at either the buffet or Orchids. The food was delicious and staff outstanding.  We had no problem getting seats by the pool, the only suggestion I would make is to add a few more umbrellas, as these get occupied quickly.  

The concierge staff assisted us with a car rental, dinners as well as transportation services to and from the airport.  Frank had helped prior to our arrival and Amy & DeeDee were great on site. 

My husband had a massage at the Spa and it was one of the best he has had. We found Lewers Lounge on the last night and what a pleasant surprise. It was a beautiful decor and the jazz singer was excellent. It had a great atmosphere and wonderful service.

The beach is very small, but the views from the property are worth it. Be sure to watch the sunset at House Without a Key. Great for cocktails or dinner.  

After walking past the other resorts we quickly realized what a gem this hotel really is. We were in Hawaii and should not have expected the opulence of the Mandarin Hyde Park, we did see how well appointed the rooms were, while having a very minimalistic decor. 

The location could not be better. Fine dining directly across the street and all the designer shops within one block.  If we did not plan on snorkeling or going to Pearl Harbor, we would not have needed a car.  Our two children aged 12 & 14 traveled with us and had a great time as well.

With the most appealing pool area around, an atmosphere of relaxed understated elegance throughout, uniformly excellent rooms and friendly service, this is almost certainly the best bet in Waikiki. 

For a special occasion, we sprang for an ocean front room with a spectacular view of Diamond Head. It was worth the $760 a night price (including breakfast). But you can save as much as $200 a night and still have a luxurious room with a pleasant view. Except for the pricey suites, all the rooms are very similar, with the rate mainly determined by the view. Even the cheapest rooms overlook beautiful gardens. Here ""garden view"" is not a euphemism for ""parking-lot view.""  

The rooms aren't glitzy or lavish, but they are comfortable and tasteful. Every room has a sofa (a bit small) and terrace (lanai in Hawaii-speak). Closet space is ample and the bathrooms are luxurious. We appreciated having a separate stall shower as well tub. The bed was superb.

The beach immediately in front of the hotel is skimpy. But the spacious pool area is perhaps the hotel's greatest plus. During our week's stay, there was never once a shortage of desirable lounge chairs. There is only one pool, but it is large and beautiful. This contrasts with the surprisingly small pools and cramped pool areas at some of the Halekulani's upscale competitors nearby. 

There is nothing even remotely like a water slide at this hotel. The lack of such facilities may make this a poor choice for family with older children. But there were a number of small kids -- almost all beautifully behaved. This may be one place where all the children really are ""above average.""  

We usually had breakfast at the informal ""House Without a Key"" restaurant, which serves a nice buffet in a pleasant indoor/outdoor setting. We tried the special Sunday brunch, really a buffet lunch, at the somewhat more formal ""Orchids"" restaurant. Except for the excellent desserts, the food wasn't fabulous, but it was good -- as it should be at $57 a head. We dined once at the top restaurant, La Mer. The room and the ocean view were spectacular. The food was better than most resort food, but wasn't distinguished enough to justify the $110 minimum prix fixe. 

There are many excellent dining options at various prices nearby.  The branch of Nobu right across the street serves interesting Japanese (or sort-of-Japanese) food, though a hungry person would have to order lots of exquisite little plates to leave feeling full. We found the Italian restaurant Taormina a block or so away served very good food at fair prices. We thought the front tables were the most appealing.  Il Lupino near the Royal Hawaiian Hotel was also good for the price, though the service was slow. Half a block from the hotel a branch of the excellent ABC convenience-story chain offered surprisingly good take-out. A couple of times, we bought lunch there and enjoyed it on our lanai overlooking Waikiki Beach -- for under $10 a head. 

The Halekulani's location couldn't be more convenient. Nearby branches of Hermes, Louis Vuitton and others should supply all your vacation necessities. The extensive local bus service took us all over town. (We found Chinatown very disappointing, but the Diamond Head excursion was spectacular.) 

So, any quibbles? Yes.  If you are dreaming of a romantic moonlit swim in the pool, forget it -- the pool closes about 6 p.m.  Also, for some bizarre reason, there are no coffee pots in the rooms.

The entire resort feels seculded from the typical hustle and bustle of Waikiki and the other hotels. This is the place to stay if you are looking for a luxurious, serene stay in Waikiki. We have vacationed on Oahu every year since 2002 and have stayed in almost all of the beachfront hotels. From now on, we will save the extra money to stay here every time. It's work the premium.

The hotel is Honolulu timeless luxury at its finest and has defied the trendy-luxury concept found at the Trump or Modern. It is not a Maui super-luxury resort with tons of family and children's programs.

The bell/ valet staff were attentive and prompt. Most imporantly though, they were professionals. They greeted us promptly, welcomed us to the hotel and escorted us to check-in and made us feel like our luggage was in good hands. 

While check-in was is efficient , it is a little clunky. In theory, check-in is handled in the room which makes sense to reduce the time standing in line and waiting to get to the room. In practice though, I handed off my credit card, confirmed my dates, and really checked-in at reception. I expected to handle this entire transaction in the room, but instead the in-room check in is really more of a hotel orientation and the only check-in activity is signing the room charge receipt. It does give a good reason to send us up to the room with a member of the staff to point out the hotel and room amenities though.

We stayed in the lowest price ""garden"" room. We were on the 5th floor which boasts extended lanais. From what we could tell, there really is not a bad room in the house.  We stayed here once before in a Diamond Head view room and were interested to see what a lower priced category offered, even the garden view rooms have a view of the ocean from the lanai. The room was huge and comfortable. Bath amenities are well appointed, and bed and  linens are luxury quality

We were here on a dual purpose business/ leisure trip. The hotel accomodates both very well. Wi-fi is speedy and easy to access anywhere in the hotel. The Living Room offers a perfect place to slave away at work in an environment that is much more pleasing than an office. 

The pool area is the daytime highlight of the hotel. The pool area is beautiful and lounge chairs are comfortable.  My only issue during this stay is the pool service waiter kept coming through yelling ""Drinks"" like we were at a ballpark. Please Halekulani, a little re-training in luxury service
for your staff. 

Some people complain about the adjacent beach. I think it is perfect for the size of the hotel. The sand is better, and the traffic is much less. If you don't like the size, DeRussey beach is a 5 minute walk to the right and the main Waikiki strip is 5 minutes to the left.","Date of stay: January 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We've had more courteous service at much less expensive hotels.  The Halekulani has the best views on Waikiki but you can enjoy a drink at Sunset without staying at the hotel.  It is very unlikely that wr will return.","Date of stay: February 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

Flying that far we much prefer to find ourselves immersed in exotic destinations, where there is a mix of cultural difference, white sand, turquoise water, pristine ocean views and close to nobody in sight.

Halekulani is all the opposite. It is a huge concrete building right downtown in the buzz of Honolulu. It's like being in a large convention hotel thinking that we're on the beach and trying to feel somewhat exotic, but being right on Fifth Avenue in New York in the busiest parts of the avenue.

The hotel is vast and rooms are spacious. Expect to pay for them, it's not cheap. But if you go, make sure that you ask for a photo of the view from the room or suite. We had a suite on the 5th floor and our view was great, overlooking Waikiki beach and the volcano. But we had family in the same expensive suite on the 3rd floor and they could only see pipes and flat industrial roof top from other parts of the hotel. The 2 extra floors made a huge difference. I would ask for the 7th or 8th floor even. You may almost feel alone from your balcony!

If you like it busy, you are always a step outside and right into the shops and very busy surroundings. But you will see that the hotel itself is busy. It is filled with Japanese visitors who obviously do not like to be in the sun too much, so they walk on the beach fully dressed and often with ""floaties"" even inflatable ""Ducks"" perhaps because they can't swim. And the beach at the Halekulani is unbelievably tiny! You get a very tiny spot of sand and there is a lot of traffic.

In front of the hotel there is a Surf Shop. We did take surf lessons, everybody from our oldest 23 year old boy to our youngest 10 year old daughter. They are remarkable. The instructors are absolutely fantastic. They cared so much about us having fun and being safe it was exceptional. And the waves there are exceptional. The water is warm, the waves are smooth and between them there is no wind, no ripple, everything is relaxed and smooth. We all were able very quickly to ride the waves and frankly we would have never stopped!

We went again and again and took all the video and photo shoots that the surf shop offered us and they are so memorable! If we ever return to Honolulu we would go back to Halekulani because while not exotic it was very comfortable and the driver for us would be to go surfing with these guys again. We tried surfing elsewhere in the Maldives, in Maui, etc... but we never had so much fun and were never able to surf the waves the way we did there. We are thinking of going to Japan and perhaps stopping there along the way for 3 days or so just for that... and maybe to play golf again because the golf in Honolulu, especially the ones close to the scenic mountains where LOST was filmed, are simply amazing. The photos from there are just unreal.

So Halekulani is not exotic, but its a comfortable place with access to world best surfing for the entire family, lots of shops and dining options, superb golfs and some nice trekking tracks as well.

Enjoy it, but ask for a high floor and a photo of the view from the room you are booking, very important!","Date of stay: July 2012","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Not comfortable with a stranger's lounge chair three inches from my chair that you sort of have to dive into from the foot area to reach.  Second breakfast wait is a joke.

Strange but tight pool with literally no beach.  Just a cement barrier to ocean.  But service is nice didn't go to La Mer as the thought of getting into a suit in Hawaii doesn't jive.

The room was very pleasant, but the real let down was the arrangements for breakfast. This was a ""benefit"" that was afforded us for the high room rate, and this was a disaster for what is supposed to be a five star best of Waikiki hotel.  We waited each day for 30 aNd 50 minutes for a breakfast tabke to be available for us. Reading through other ISS, our experience was not unique, and this is a very poor sign of management.  I would not recommend anyone to tolerate this and take a discount on the room rate, and buy your breakfast across the road and wait 10 seconds. 

The menu in the room without a key was disappointing, and had limited variety.  You would certainly not eat there willingly twice. 

So overall it's a nice enough hotel, but not worth the gazillions that we have been charged. I would require significant encouragement to return.","Date of stay: January 2013","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

Frankly, I might not be as enamored of this hotel if the staff was not as fantastic as they are.  I have NEVER stayed at a hotel where the people working there from door man to gift store clerk were as hospitable and genuinely caring as the staff we encountered.  In  every instance they went way out of their way to be courteous, helpful and give beyond normal service.  I had an issue with hot water in the bathroom and in less than five minutes, someone came to fix it.  I was looking for a product that was not displayed in the gift store. The woman working there knew where I could find what I wanted and actually went to get it for me!  How amazing isn that?

We had the romance remembered dining experience one evening and would highly recommend it, really good four course meal. 

Location was perfect, the smarter side of town ( although the whole of the area was great the other end had more 'beachy hotels and cheaper options) it is right opposite Nobu, which was a great experience. 

The Outrigger hotel next door was also very good, their Shorebird restaurant is right on the beach, we ate breakfast there and a few dinners, if you feel like a change. (we stayed there the week before moving to Halekulani)

Beach and pool were great, small beach was perfect for the guests to use, there were showers right next to the Halekulani gate, the pool attendants were really helpful and provide plenty of clean towels for the beach or pool.

Our ocean front room was indeed very nice and the room amenities were up to expectation but service was a different matter. Every morning you could not simply walk into the poolside restaurant where a buffet breakfast was served. You had to wait to be seated and the staff were not particularly quick in preparing empty tables for the next lot of guests. Inevitably, lines of waiting guests were building up and often it was necessary to wait at least 20 minutes to be seated. The buffet was not particularly good with slow replenishment and lacking many breakfast items found in other hotels. The selection of breads was particularly poor. On New Years Day an overflow room was opened up for breakfast above the usual restaurant, to cater for the larger crowds. This should have been done throughout the busy holiday period. Other instances of service lapses can be illustrated by the experience of friends with whom we traveled. One morning there was a knock on their door at 6.30am by the porter wishing to take down their luggage.

This is my first review.  I felt compelled to write a review of Halekukani because its current ranking of 3 on Tripadvisor might lead the community of readers to believe that Halekulani actually should rank as lowly as 3rd amongst the hotels of Honolulu.  Dear readers, do not think that for a second, as Halekulani is The Finest Hotel in Honolulu and one of the finest hotels in the world.  

I have stayed at Halekulani twice and will never stay anywhere else in Honolulu.  What marks Halekulani as distinct from so many other hotels is EXCEPTIONAL SERVICE.  Halekulani makes you feel like you have been invited into someone's home (and a very beautifully decorated and equipped home at that), which is a difficult thing for a hotel to achieve.  From staff all across the board - Duty manager, restaurant staff, reception, porters, concierges, car valets - all staff I have encountered in my two stays could not help me enough during my stay.  Example, when I checked in this time, I had a 2 single beds rather than a King size bed.  On mentioning this to the staff member who escorted me to my room on arrival, the duty manager (Moses) came and visited me in the room and quickly arranged for the beds to be removed and a proper king size mattress to be moved into the room.  No fuss, no problem.  That evening, a box of chocolates and a personal apology note from Moses arrived at my room as a result of this ""discomfort"" on checking in.  Nice touch.  How many hotels have done that for you?  I wanted the formal English-style afternoon tea that same day, but the designated afternoon tea room was full.  So, the manager of that service made up a special table in Orchids restaurant overlooking the ocean and served a specialised personal afternoon tea service there.  Again, no fuss, no problem.  Just solving problems to ensure that guests have an exceptional hotel experience.

In my opinion, Halekulani sits on the best position on Waikiki Beach.  For those who have not  been to Honolulu before, the beach is curved and Halekulani sits at the ""top"" of the curve, so you can get brilliant side-on views of Diamond Head from Halekulani, which cannot be said of many hotels in Honolulu, although others on Waikiki Beach do have similar (not as good) views of Diamond Head.  If that's not important to you, then don't worry about it.  But, it's important to me.  I won't go to Honolulu that many times in my life, but when I do, I want to see the amazing natural beauty that is Diamond Head, when I wake up, when I watch TV in the living room, when I sit on my balcony, you get the idea?

That takes me onto the next point and a word of advice - Halekulani has a square-W shaped building structure.  Othre reviews have mentioned nice beach view rooms and garden view rooms and I'm sure they are nice.  But (and apologies if this sounds a bit snobbish), Halekulani's position on Waikiki Beach is so good (see above), that if you can afford it, you should always chose a Diamond Head Room or a Diamond Head Suite.  You will have the most awesome side-on views of Diamond Head from these rooms, but it makes for a beautiful hotel stay when you see that amazing view all the time from your room.  Other rooms at Halekulani don't have that side-on Diamond Head view due to the shape of the hotel, so chose your room and your budget carefully.

The pool - this is important for many people, especially those with kids.  So take note.  Halekulani is not like the Westin Maui or Grand Wailea (both in Maui), which both have awesome water slide / pool complexes that kids absolutely adore.  Halekulani has only one largish oval shaped pool (maybe 30 metres x 15 metres) and no water slides.  If large water slides / pool complexes are important to you (or your kids), go to another hotel, as the Halekulani does not deliver on that front.  As some other reviewers have noted, there are always enough pool chairs at the pool and the pool attendants are great.

The beach - you might be confused by some of the other reviews, so let me make this clear.  Halekulani sits right on Waikiki Beach.  However, in front of (most of) Halekulani, there is a beach wall (ie no sandy beach).  But at the right hand side and left hand side of that beach wall (which is also at the left and right hand in front of Halekulani), there are two small beaches.  These are actually really nice small beaches which people use to sun bath and swim in the Waikiki beach ocean, so don't be confused about this issue.  You can get access to those two small beaches straight in front of Halekulani.  If you want to join the masses on the thick, wide part of Waikiki Beach, you only need to walk 2 minutes along the beach and you're there.  So, at Halekulani, you have great beach Waikiki Beach options.

Food - Halekulani has a range of food options, from casual pool dining, a la carte at Orchids, afternoon tea (see above) and a high class restaurant, so there is something for everyone.  Note that Halekulani uses very high quality ingredients, so you can have good, tasty and nutrious food using the best quality ingredients at Halekulani, a combaination which can be harder to find elswhere than you might have thought. 

Concierges - Halekulani is a 5-star hotel and the concierges are first rate.  Nothing was too difficult to organise and they had a mountain of good advice and called me back when I asked them to do so.

Halekulani is a little more expensive than other hotels, so if you are budget conscious, best to look elsewhere.  But, the guest experience at Halekulani is so superb, that I have not regretted for a second the money that I have spent there.  That extra money has bought me some of the very best hotelling experiences I have had anywhere and I have travelled widely and stayed at many fine hotels.

Bear this in mind - Hawaii is a great place for visit for a holiday.  Honolulu / Oahu has so much going for it and many sites and experiences that will draw me back there in the future.  But one of the main features that will make me look forward to visiting Honolulu again is the prospect of staying at Halekulani one more time.

We had a wonderful time and we experienced a high level of service at the majority of the hotel's outlets.  A special warm thank you to the concierge desk (they did the impossible for us), House without a Key restaurant, the front desk, the spa (let me book last minute services), the housekeeping staff, room service, Le Mer and hotel boutique.   It seemed to us that whenever we asked for something - we received it. When we were getting ready to leave on our last night I was so emotional that I had to leave that I wept.

There is a louvered door separating bath from bed area making it impossible to turn on the light or use the facilities without waking up your partner.  It is as if there is no door at all.  It should have been a solid door. No privacy at all.  I have seen others on this site complain about the lack of coffee maker.

Expensive small room was compounded by high season premium. Pool was OK but smallish size reflective of land premium on Waikiki. Never struggled to get a sun bed though which was nice for a hotel operating at full capacity. Two gripes with this hotel were 1) Wait for a breakfast buffet table were up to 30 minutes. Staff kindly accommodated our party as we were pushed for time but 30 minutes for a buffet table is obscene and completely unacceptable even allowing for extremely busy holiday season 2) Internet in room did not work for majority of our stay. I was partly at fault for not reporting it sooner. Having checked out other cheaper hotels in area during our stay I would still probably come back to this hotel which was a class above its neighbors although you are paying for that.

Beautiful setting and great location 

The room was all that we expected and more, the staff are magnificent ( they need to be as the hotel as we were told by an outsider is a non union employer and they have a one strike policy with staff, one mistake and you are gone).

Every thing with the Hotel is excellent with one exception ...... when you are paying $800 per night for a room (after taxes ) how come we have to queue for Breakfast and in the evening for cocktail for 20 to 30 minutes...... where else do you queue for cocktails?? The pool is nice but people reserve their spots at 7 am!!!

The organisation around Breakfast and evening spaces an Room without a Key need to be reviewed.

 The daily Japanese weddings on the lawn were fantastic. 
The food was yummy ($$$) morning miso soup at the buffet was a favorite. Cocktails yummy, strong.
Why is this a 4 star and not 5?
1. Concierge services were mediocre. Handing me a brochure is not what I expect. Several times we consulted and tipped them only to walk away feeling like we still had to arrange our own trip.
2.The worst toiletries I have ever used in a luxury hotel. What about these would make me want to visit their spa? Nothing!!!
3. Pool attendants made us feel like we were in the way and their overly serious tone made the pool area very boring. Good if you don't want to swim with your kids and have fun. You will be glared at,

The beach directly outside of this hotel is TINY.. No beach service there. You have to move elsewhere for a place to sit and rent umbrellas.

I love posh hotels. I don't subscribe to the belief that a hotel is just a place to sleep. The hotel sets the tone for the whole trip. The Halekulani made this hotel snob quite happy. We actually started out at the Royal Hawaiian. Even though that hotel has it's charms, it simply wasn't what I was looking for. So we moved over to the Halekulani and booked via Amex Fine Hotels & Resorts. The lobby is airy and markedly less frenetic than neighboring hotels. It was immediately calming, which is quite rare in Honolulu. The service is excellent. We checked into a Ocean Front room on the second floor, just above the spa. I would def request that room again. What was really nice is that I could walk up the lovely staircase which ascends right on top of a fountain/water feature and never needed the elevator. The restaurants at the Halekulani are really quite good. I'd rec the House Without a Key and Orchids for lunch and breakfast. Orchids is also lovely at dinnertime. Service was really outstanding at Orchids. What is definitely not to be missed is L'Aperitif at La Mer. It's the gorgeous bar inside La Mer, and it serves really interesting cocktails paired with an amuse bouche. It's a really cool spot. Go. I didn't get the chance to eat at La Mer but it looked really good. Also not to be missed is Lewer's Lounge which is a cozy jazz bar in the hotel. We also did afternoon tea which was lovely. To conclude, the best thing about Honolulu is the Halekulani.","Date of stay: November 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Opulent and sumptuous atmosphere but warm and homey at the same time, the Halakulani specialises in treating each guest as a welcome family member. We loved the surprises at the nightly turndown and also all the invitations to attend cocktails with the manager, afternoon tea and performances.... I absolutely advise you to Join LHW - Leading Hotels of the world before you go. The membership cost is $150 per year but the benefits are huge- back fast for two each day, invitations to private gatherings and the service just improves because there is an extra incentive for staff to ensure you have a great time. We booked a partial ocean view - beautiful, but the LHW membership also guarantees a room upgrade on arrival so again, it can't be beaten. We just LOVED our stay and will return in another year to do it all again! Also don't miss out on dining at La Mer- to say it is stunning is really missing the point. It is an experience for your stomach, your soul and your well being. We dined in all of the restaurants and found them all great - I have a craze on fresh pineapple now! The Lewers Lounge was a pleasant surprise - a real jazz club with entertainment that was world class. You won't see the type of screaming drunkards you'd find at The Outrigger next door or the Aussie Bogans you now find down the road at the Moana Surfrider - that's what happens when a hotel is featured on Hone& Away! You will also really enjoy the proximity to all the shops and the fact that the Concierge will arrange everything for you at your convenience - including tours and trips out to the Waikelefrom Premium Outlet!

We had a Diamond Head Ocean Front room on the 8th floor which looked out over the sea and Diamond Head.  The other rooms view will be blocked by the Sheraton next door so if you want to guarantee the view, book this level of room!

The room was practical and clean.  Bathroom was accessed through the wardrobe sliding doors - nice touch as with them open, you could shower and still look out to the view if you wanted.  The hotel is popular with Japanese tourists and is a calm oasis from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki.  We ate at House without a Key and had drinks watching the entertainment and the food and drinks were excellent.  Sadly, we didn't eat at the other restaurants so cannot comment on those.

The beach area out front is quite small but walkways in front of the hotels either side take you to the longer Waikiki beaches.

The hotel is perfectly located on the beach and near to the shops on Kalakaua Avenue for high end shops such as Louis Vuitton, Tiffany etc and 10 mins from Ala Moana Shopping Centre.

Pool area was small, but did not need to spend any time there. The included breakfast buffet was simple but met our needs (rice, miso soup, pickles, smoked salmon and steamed vegetables for me; omelet bar, cereal, bread, cheese, bacon and sausages for DH). Every night at turndown there was a small little gift, which was a very nice touch. Shower was small but excellent functionality. One improvement was at checkout- the staffer at the checkout desk was brusque and seemed unfriendly. We had a very late flight out. The check out staffer did not mention the hospitality suite. It was the very helpful and friendly bag valet that mentioned that there is a hospitality suite with lockers and two showers that can be used by guests after checkout. This meant we could have hung out at the beach and showered before changing into our cold weather airplane clothes. The hospitality suite is also the business centre. Please note that suitcases cannot be brought up to the suite- but small carry bags can be locked in a locker for change of clothes. There are also complimentary beverages- coffee, tea, cold drinks.

This time it worked out.  I had a town car pick up my husband and I at the airport, which was worth it.  The bellmen upon our arrival were helpful and friendly.  Unfortunately, that was the highlight of staying here so far.  The front desk was a bit impersonal.  Yes, we had a receptionist take us on a brief tour and walk us to our room.  I had reserved through Amex Fine Hotels & Resorts so had hoped we might get an upgrade only to find what I thought was more of a downgrade.  Imagine my surprise when we were given a room with twin beds.  The receptionist explained that no room type is guaranteed.  Everything is a request, and basically you get what you get when you arrive.  So word to the wise, think about what you want in a room and is not getting it worth the $$$.

The receptionist said she would have housekeeping turn the twins into a king, which did not happen.  We had to call down hours later once we returned to find nothing had been done.  Of course simply pushing the two together just isn't quite the same.  Also, problems with the phone were not corrected as promised, until I called again hours later also.  Have to wait till tomorrow to get that fixed.  I requested and opportunity to upgrade my room, which I certainly could do for another $1,300 a night. No one seemed to care that I wasn't happy with my $700 a night twin bed room.   

Anyway, rooms are fairly small unless you reserve a suite.  Seating is limited in the room.  Ocean front means you get a view of the pool and a tiny bit of the ocean.  Pool seems overly small and I am certain the beach area is equally as small.  Overall, we are greatly disappointed.  I do not feel the care and concern that other reviews have mentioned.  For the money, I would think twice before ever staying here again.  Probably didn't help that we had just stayed at the Four Seasons in Kona which blew us away in terms of service and rooms, compared to this.","Date of stay: November 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_20"

After reading hundreds of reviews on TripAdvisor, I couldn’t pass up Halekulani. Not only is it featured in just about every travel magazine, the reviews were outstanding. We normally don’t spend this much on a hotel, but thought we would splurge as this was a special trip for us. We booked through the Platinum Amex website since they had extra amenities such as complimentary dining credit and a room upgrade on arrival. We had chosen an oceanfront room in hopes that we would be upgraded to the next category up, Diamond Head view, but they were sold out when we checked in. I was a little disappointed, but knew that it was based on availability so wasn’t too surprised. 

The check in process is really neat. They take your name when you arrive and then take you up to your room to complete the check in process. The actual room was beautiful and had the best bathroom I have ever seen in a hotel. 

There is a small beach directly outside the resort but is public and swarming with people. The pool was very nice but too small for the amount of people staying at the hotel. The location is fantastic though. There are so many things within walking distance, it’s nice. 

I strongly recommend Restaurant Suntory. It is a teppenyaki restaurant about 10 minutes (walking) from the hotel. We both love teppenyaki and try to visit a new place each time we travel, but this was by far the best one we have ever been to. In fact, we tried to get reservations for the second night we were there as well, but couldn’t get in. 

The spa is also extremely expensive but worth every penny. We got a couple’s massage and it was one of the best massages I have ever had. There is a foot ritual that they do before your treatment, and it just sets the mood. The spa area where they send you to relax before your treatment is near the pool, so I highly recommend an early morning or late afternoon appointment if quiet is what you are looking for. 

Other than the check in process and the spa, the service wasn’t what I was expecting after reading so many glowing reviews. Aside from the location and fabulous bathroom, I didn’t find anything that made this hotel worth the price we paid. 

Overall, we enjoyed our stay at Halekulani but will be choosing another hotel next time we are in Honolulu.","Date of stay: August 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

The service -- especially Casey at the pool -- was impeccable, without being pretentious.  And the mai tais were the best we had while in Hawaii.

It is a really good hotel but it doesn't have any character, just another 5 star hotel. I suppose I was expecting something a bit more special with our room as we had a diamond ocean view suite. Next time I would probably just get a normal room with sea views as they all have balconies.

We were greeted at the lobby, our luggage whisked away and after we had checked in, we were personally escorted to our room and shown all the features of the room.
We had a view over the pool and ocean and it was just lovely. At night from the lanai, you could hear the live music from the bar downstairs .
We mentioned that it was our honeymoon at reception and when we returned from dinner the 1st night, there was a bottle of champagne on ice and glasses waiting for us in our room with a note from the manager. Neither my husband or myself are champagne drinkers so we left a note with housekeeping thanking them for the champagne but that as neither of us drink champagne, please return it so it is not wasted. The next day we received a phone call from the manager asking whether we would prefer a bottle of red or white wine instead. SO nice . and this was how the rest of our 3 night stay continued. When we went down to the pool, they made up 'beds' for us and then handed us towels. We even had a guy come round at one point, giving us complementary ice blocks which was great on a hot day.

What a mistake, from check in to departure we did not experience anything to warrant a five star rating.  The rooms were small and cheaply constructed with balconies that left one feeling like they were in a fish bowl.
After waiting a half an hour for our luggage so we could go swimming I called downstairs and was told they didn't know which luggage was ours.  Other hotels have called me when situations such as this arise after five minutes.

Japanese owned and operated it is immaculate, efficent, and very classy. One of the most popular locations for destination weddings for couples from Japan. On some days you may see a half dozen different weddings taking place. Carefully select your room according to how much ocean you want to pay for. Partial ocean view can be a sliver or you have to go out to the lanai to see it. Ocean view can still have some views of the surrounding high rise hotels from certain angles in the room. Only when you get to ocean front are you seeing the ocean from anywhere in the room. Diamond Head is the ultimate with a view down Waikiki to the crater. Expensive but worth it for that once in a lifetime experience. This is a popular and busy hotel right on the Waikiki boardwalk, so be prepared for lots of people and activity. Lots to see & do.

We stayed on both properties and I would rate the Halekulani higher than the Four Seasons on Maui ( Four Seasons on the Big Island is in another class altogether!). It just goes to show how subjective this website is  - it is always good to get different opinions.
We stayed in an Oceanfront room which was excellent - great views over the pool and Waikiki beach. Breakfast on the lanai watching the surfers was a great way to start the day.
The room was a good size ( very similar to the FS in Maui) with a spacious bathroom. I would suggest the addition of an ironing board and iron would be good ( available on request) and a kettle for making tea would be great. Coffee making facilities are provided.
Service was professional and consistent throughout the hotel with special kudos to the bell, room service and concierge staff. There are three restaurants to choose from - my favourite is Orchids.
The  beach area is very small but it is easy to walk to a larger area of Waikiki - better still hire a car and go to some of the other wonderful ( and quieter) beaches around Oahu.
The Halekulani is within easy walking distance of shops and restaurants and there is an ABC store ( to fill up your hotel mini-bar) about 50 yards away.

The Halekulani is a beautiful hotel on the beach in Waikiki. The room is pretty but a little small compared to the other hotels. Breakfast in Orchids was very good. Why I rated the hotel 3 stars is for the following reasons. We spent several hours by the pool on our last day. We got out of our room by 9:30 am and returned at 1pm to find the room not maid up and me having to call housekeeping to get them to show up. We left the hotel 20 minutes later and they had not shown up yet. this hotel is well over $500 a night and this should not be expected. While at the pool I ordered 2 smoothies and they were made in the wrong flavor. The 3rd thing, I ordered a 3:30am wake up call for Tuesday morning and they called on Monday morning our last night we did not need to get up early.

The location is ideal to literally fall out of the lobby into shops and restaurants. Over the rd from the great Roy's restaurant :-) 
The hotel has a slight business feel about it and the corridors have a funny smell. The room was nice, partial ocean view but most of the view was of the many other balconies which over looked ours. The mini bar is one u personalise ie choose and pay for what u want up front. We stupidly bough a couple of corona beers at 7 dollars each and a couple of cokes and sparkling water. I wish we'd gone for that 1st walk 1st as there's an abc store a 2 min walk away with everything and I mean everything and a pack of 6 coronas were 9 dollars! 
The pool was nice, very cold though. The pool side service was very good, loved the daily ice lollies. The cocktails, I'm afraid were horrible, I tried 2 and my hubby tried 1, not good. 
Orchids restaurant was lovely, great setting service food and wine.
There isn't really a beach here. It's a very small patch of sand that leads to the coastal pathway which leads in both directions to the main Waikiki beach so if it's important to u to have a hotel with own beach, halekelani is not for you. 
Service was excellent, very helpful concierge. 
Spa - I maybe just chose the wrong massage, had the hawaiian one. She was far too hard with me and I was far too British to tell her she was hurting me. Afterwards she told my husband what strong muscles I had that I could take the deep massage.....I just wished she'd asked me if the pressure was ok...nooo!  My husband really liked his one though. 
Honololou is fabulous, loads and loads of shops open til very late. We were shopping at 11.30 at night. Lots of choice of restaurants, dukes is great. We did the pearl harbour tour with a company called enoa booked through the concierge. It was great and had the best rep I have ever encountered called Shannon o'brien, the Irish Hawaiian (as he calls himself) reviewed separately.

All the great reviews you read are true in terms of service, location, etc.  The pool area is seemingly a little cramped but honestly compared to nothing else in the area it is top notch and the service is fantastic. My husband and I are both corporate executives and travel a lot domestically and internationally as we'll as for personal so we have a good benchmark for five star service. Our only handicap was that we had never been to Hawaii and we relied a bit too much on a travel agent instead of doing expensive tripadvisor reviews as we normally do for personal travel. 

Here is my recommendation to those either on their honeymoon or on a romantic trip to Hawaii for the first time - Waikiki is very busy - I am from New York - it's NY busy - this is not fault of the hotel this was our travel agents mistake but our honeymoon started in Kauai at the grand Hyatt for five days (fabulous) then we did a week at the four seasons in Maui (fabulous).  My husband booked the whole trip without me and he mentioned we like nightlife etc and at one point were considering stopping in Vegas on our way back from Hawaii so our travel agent got the wrong idea for what we were looking for IN Hawaii ( not Vegas - we get Vegas and would know what to expect).  Waikiki is VERY busy. So here is my advice - if you are going to Hawaii and are planning to go see Pearl Harbor or for any reason want to go to Waikiki do it at the beginning of your trip not the end.  We were in such a state of bliss and relaxation from Kauai and Maui that we were schell shocked to say the least when we got to the halekulani - it's a great place but know its much like NY or another big city and you will be ok. 

Also - the hotel was extremely helpful in getting us a rental car arranged the day following our arrival - we decided after our moping for the half day we arrived  that if we were not still in the tranquility of Maui that we would go explore the north shore which is riddled with fabulous beaches and find it. The best move ever - beautiful drive romantic desolate beaches - we got right back in the honeymoon mode and honestly wouldn't have visited the north shore otherwise which has some of the best beaches in the world.  Ps it was awesome to come back to Waikiki and go to Nobu for dinner at night which is right across the street - also we did in fact go see Pearl Harbor which was also really great. 

Overall just make sure you either start your trip with Waikiki or just make sure you know if you are ending it there and want to end it at the best hotel in the area that you are in for a shock but it most certainly is not for a lack of excellent service delivery etc from the halekulani.","Date of stay: September 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

But I cannot fail to write a review to  say how wonderful our stay at this hotel was.  It is a long way to go from the U.K. but it was worth it.  Everthing was fantastic on an hour by hour, day by day basis.  Your stay will not come cheap but the other hotels in Wakiki are almost as expensive but by no means are they as classy, relaxing and with such fantastic service and attention to detail.  Our room was comfortable, airy with fantastic views.  The staff addressed us by name from day one and always made us welcome.  This was reinforced by a  wonderful gesture at dinner on our penultimate night when we celebrated our wedding anniversary.  We found the cocktail bar a delight, I challenge anyone to have just one ""lost passion"".  Sitting listening to the in house, piano and horn playing duo became a frequent  evening pleasure during our stay.  The food is excellent, The by the pool sandwichs and smoothies made it very difficult to leave the sun lounger in search of other activities, but I suppose that is the point of relaxing on holiday.  By the time that we left we felt that we had made new friends that we would miss very much upon our return to wet and cold england.  I cannot reccomend this hotel enough.","Date of stay: April 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

It provides an oasis of calm right on Waikiki beach, which is one of the the main draws for my wife and I having just returned from our eighth stay at the property.  We enjoy the fun/activities/bars/shopping etc. around Waikiki but love to return to the peaceful setting of Halekulani for evening cocktails at House Without a Key and to relax.

Looking back at other reviews it is hard to add much that hasn't been said before, but one test of a hotel's standards over a sustained period of time are the number of repeat guests.  As I noted above, this was our eighth visit (over an eleven year period) and we wouldn't hesitate to book again.  Meeting up with other guests at the ""Manager's Reception"" it is not at all unusual to meet couples that are on their 25th or 30th visit which I think says it all.

Rooms are not huge but are wonderfully furnished and immaculately turned out.  By my recollection they have been completely refurbished three times in the eleven years that we have been coming to Halekulani so you should be assured of a modern room.  Beds are very comfortable and the bed linen of very high quality.  We generally reserve a Diamond Head View room which look along the length of Waikiki beach towards Diamond Head - not the cheapest but worth it!

There are three restaurants and a bar on the property, and over the years we have frequented all of them.  For Orchids or La Mer (the latter being their most upscale restaurant) I would suggest making a dinner reservation before traveling to make sure you get the evening you want.  For breakfast, we tend to eat at Orchids rather than House Without a Key as it is waiter service though this is strictly a personal preference as both are really good.  The Sunday Brunch in Orchids is absolutely stunning but do book ahead as it is really popular with hotel guests and locals alike.  Quality of food at all of the restaurants is first rate.

The pool itself is beautiful but the pool area is not that huge so if you want a specific poolside place to sit or sunbathe then I recommend getting down to the pool early.  The pool is conveniently situated right next to the beach.  The hotel grounds are immaculate and the on site florist provides some truly amazing floral displays around the hotel - look out for the one in the reception area when you arrive!  There is an onsite spa which I have only used once when I needed a haircut but my wife has used it several times and speaks well of her experience.

In my opinion, the best hotel on Waikiki.","Date of stay: September 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

After having your credit card swiped at the front desk you are whisked away to your room to complete the check in process. It was wonderful being treated like a Princess when in reality I was tied and in need of a shower after a long delayed flight.
There are a variety of rooms to choose from. My room had a view of Diamond head and Waikiki beach. Unlike some hotels rooms don't come with an iron and ironing board, however a quick call to housekeeping and one was brought to me.

I tired in room dinning a few times and the meals always arrived before the state time and where wonderfully delicious. Coming from a non tipping country, tipping confuses me. I was very impressed that the in room dining attendant pointed out that the tip was included in the bill and I did not need to tip further. In other hotels I stayed where the tip is included it has never been pointed out. They just take the money.

I dined at House Without a Key for breakfast and lunch and meals were very tastey. The servers were very attentive. 

There a plenty of shops within easy walking distance.

My highlight of the hotel was that it was a relaxing oasis, but if you wishes for more action, just step out onto the street.
The low point if any, was the hotel seems to have a few issues with pigeons roosting on the balconies. Though housekeeping did clean the balcony, table and chairs each day, I would not recommend walking out there in bare feet without checking first.","Date of stay: August 2012","Trip type: Traveled solo","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Halekulani is a wonderful property in a primo location with uber talented Staff-guaranteeing their Guests simply the best experience in Waikiki. Location-right smack in the middle of great restaraunts, shopping, and easy beach access. It is surprisingly quiet and private feeling-a remarkable accomplishment given the number of rooms and property size (it still feels like a small Boutique Hotel). Our room was well thought out aesthetically and electronically, easy on the eyes-cool blue, white and sand color scheme, a beautiful view of the famous pool and ocean, two patios-one set up for Dining and the other with Chaises, a lovely display of fruit was placed in our Room upon arrival-also fresh flowers, a separate living/lounging space, two bathrooms including a washlet in one (no doubt an amenity due to the significant percentage of Japanese Guests), tub and shower each had separate hand sprayers which is unusual and makes it convenient to wash your hair after a nice soak in the tub, Shampoo & Conditioner were nice enough that I'd leave my usual favorites at home next time, Housekeeping Staff is SUPERB-and I am a picky one in that department! There were very few Children-and the few were extremely well behaved, quiet and mostly Japanese. We saw recognizeable VIP's Poolside and it's a testament to how low key and comfortable the Resort makes every Guest feel. I just sooo appreciated not feeling like I was in the Family Splash Zone while counting coconuts and reading my book. 
ALL of the food was wonderful-and exceeded our expectations. Breakfast at Orchids especially the Japanese Breakfast was terrific, High Tea was lovely, House without a key had a nice Breakfast (Buffet) as well as lethal Mai Tais and live music for Sunset. All of the Staff are welcoming, friendly and pleasant. The aha moment of the trip was when I received my laundry back from the Valet and they had not only cleaned our things beautifully but also took it upon themselves to repair a small flaw in a Linen shirt by reweaving!!

I'm usually not one to comment on value or price and neither should you.  To enjoy the Halekulani is to not worry about such things and cherish what is has to offer.  We stayed in a Ocean View Room With Balcony on one of the higher floors and woke to a beautiful sight each morning and each night there was a lovely band in one of the restaurants playing Hawaiian music which we enjoyed on our balcony.  

Breakfast was included in our stay and we went back to the same restaurant which served both an american style and japanese buffet.  Eggs made to order, fresh squeezed juice on demand, it couldn't have been better.  Our waitress Cindy knew how to make us feel welcomed and special every day.

Like many others making the journey from one side of the main Waikiki beach to the other, I passed the Halekulani on the elevated walkway that borders the property.  Looking in, the grounds were immaculate, the restaurant (Orchids) looked like an oasis from the busy, frantic surrounds, and the overall image of the hotel was one of elegance and sophistication.

Fast-forward to earlier this year and planning my return vacation I was determined to return to the Halekulani as a guest.  Of course that involved a fair degree of justifying the price.  As you are probably aware, staying at the ""house befitting heaven"" doesn't come cheap.  We stayed during the height of the Japanese obon festival, which it turns out is one of the resort's busiest times, and were quoted full rack rate during this time.  After some research and reading another review, I booked through luxuryhotelexperts.com and received a guaranteed upgrade (from Ocean View to Ocean Front) and complimentary breakfast at House Without A Key (buffet breakfast) or Orchids (full American breakfast only).

The Halekulani has recently undergone a complete renovation (or ""renewal"" in Halekulani speak) and to say the hotel is in better shape than ever would not be a stretch.  As others have mentioned the grounds are impeccable.  All the common areas have been completely redone - the abundant teak wood and stone is all new or at least looks it.  The reception, lifts and lounges are beautifully decorated.  The key here is less is more - beautifully understated.  If you are looking for gaudy waterfalls, light shows and porters with headsets, this is not the right hotel for you.  You will be rewarded with spectacular ikebana (Japanese floral) arrangements every where you look.

We requested a room on a high floor and were not disappointed.  Our room was not quite ready for the 3pm check in so we were offered complimentary cocktails until our room was ready (a short time later).  This was a small price to pay given the staff assured it was worth the wait for a fabulous room.  Given we were busy enjoying cocktails, the staff skipped the walking tour of the hotel so we could head up to our room when it suited us, with the offer that we could come to reception at any time during our stay and receive the tour of the grounds (which we did, aided by a wonderful staff member the following day).

Our room - 1408 - was spectacular.  On the second from top floor, we had no neighbour to the left, and no one above us.  It felt like our very own secluded room in the clouds.  As we arrived the porter had already placed our bags in the room and room service were delivering complimentary mineral and still water.  We were blown away by the room - it is a sumptuous mix of natural tones - all white and light blue, all highlighting the amazing blue vistas outside our room.  The quality of the renovation - sorry, renewal - is top notch.  Everything in the room is new from the ground up.  The rooms are a very good size, and the lighting and in-room electrical control panel are all new.  The bathroom is beautiful, with fresh flowers and a wide range of amenities.  The only reservation I have about the bathroom is the bath is very small (it's deep but for anyone over 5' 6"" you will not be able to even lean back in the bath comfortably) and the air conditioning did not have a dedicated outlet which meant the bathroom was a little on the warm side.

As others have mentioned, there is a turndown service which means the comforter is removed from the bed and a trademark gift is left on the bed each night.  Oddly, we found our comforter was left in different locations each night, sometimes tucked into the bedside table and others on the couch or footstool.  Complimentary water is provided day or night and the ice bucket is always full after each room servicing.  We ordered room service one night and were so delighted by the beautifully set table (again with flower arrangement) and gorgeous presentation.  We wished we had of enjoyed dinner on our balcony more as we enjoyed it so much.  The prices of the room service were very reasonable and there was a quick turn around on our order.  

We rarely heard noise in our room but it's important to note that even though we were 14 floors up, Waikiki is noisy and you can still hear the police sirens and the occasional delivery truck with it's reversing alarm going off at all hours of the night.  Opening the balcony doors allows in the peaceful sounds of the ocean at night and the hula show in the early evening.  Both delightful.  The TV was very large and had a huge array of channels, with excellent reception.

Whilst exploring the grounds of the hotel it is very evident this resort leaves nothing to chance.  The service from the moment you arrive to the time you (sadly) leave is exceptional.  The hotel clientele is predominantly Japanese and that means a few things - the hotel is a sanctuary from the loud, obnoxious people outside the hotel; the fellow guests are extremely courteous (just try and be the last person to exit a lift when there are other guests or staff on board!) and the low key, high grade levels of service never feel like a desperate cry for a big gratuity - in fact in several cases gratuities were discouraged (our complimentary breakfast expressly stated the gratuity was included).  The other important factor to note when considering the service levels is that the staff here are very mature and clearly have worked here for many years.  They take pride in the service they provide and it is a delight to get to know them and watch them as they go about their work, knowing they are the best in their field.

In terms of the restaurants, we dined at Orchids and House Without a Key on several occasions.  I'll post more detailed reviews under their listings on tripadvisor but my brief comments are below:

House Without a Key - we were so pleasantly surprised by our many meals and cocktails here - the other reviews I have read had mentioned the pricing was too high or food was not a good quality.  We found this to be anything but the truth.  First off the level of service we received was equal to anywhere else we dined including Orchids.  It was excellent - friendly, formal yet casual and highly attentive.  The food was great and we thought very affordable (considering the cost of the accommodation).  The only reservation I have is the wine list is very limited.  The times we came here for cocktails, despite the venue being full, the cocktails came out within minutes (as opposed to other hotels in Waikiki where you had to practically mug the waiter/waitress to get them to take your order).  Surprisingly, despite the hotel being full, we never found the lunch service to be very busy, which is a shock given the spectacular views of Diamond Head and the ocean.  Even nights when the venue appeared full for the hula show, the staff put seats together for our large party, perhaps as they knew we were guests.  All in all, we loved dining at House Without A Key and miss it dearly.

Orchids - I planned a birthday dinner well ahead of time, with 11 guests all staying in Waikiki, and it was a pleasure to deal with Ku'ulei in reservations.  She was so helpful in organising the menu and a birthday cake (even organising place cards with names converted into Hawaiian!).  I asked roughly what time the sun sets when our booking was made to ensure we would have the best seating time, and she responded within 4 minutes with the exact time it would set on the day we had booked (months in advance!).  We had the best table in the house and our waiter, Gary, was extremely attentive and the food was excellent.  There is no where else with the service and setting Orchids offers at this price.  We did not dine at La Mer but it looked spectacular.

In terms of the dress code, the hotel places signage at dusk stating evening attire is required.  We still wore shorts and t-shirts at House Without a Key without issue.  For our dinner at Orchids our group ensured they were wearing collars and at least neat jeans for the men, and there were no issues.  I would say that unless you are confident you may find this a little intimidating, even though we never saw it enforced.

Other facilities - we swam in the pool a couple of times and it's reasonably large compared to most other hotels in the area.  The pool lounges are the most comfortable I have ever experienced (although they are a little short in length, perhaps catering to the Japanese guests) and as others have mentioned, I found the staff in this area a little unfriendly, although they are courteous and attentive.  I did witness the pool attendant politely ""shushing"" two children in the pool who were playing ball and making a bit of noise.  This was actually a great thing as the pool is below most of the rooms but I would suggest this place isn't for you if you are happy to let your children run riot.  There were quite a few tiles loose on the floor of the pool so I suspect it's time it received the renewal treatment too.  The gift shop is beautiful and contains an extensive collection of Halekulani goods from clothing to engraved glasses, and not forgetting the absolutely beautiful handmade chocolates you'll find in your room upon arrival.  The staff here were wonderfully attentive.

Negatives - very few - the bath is too small to relax in (although it is deep) and although the room cleanliness was exceptional, there were a few odd quirks (comforter's random resting place after turn down, and also the ice buckets from our complimentary mineral water were not removed after two room cleaning visits, and two wine glasses were not washed but left as is after our room was cleaned).   We also found the service at Orchids during breakfast time a bit 'stiff'.  Glory Jean whom seated us was wonderful and warm (and organised birthday cake at breakfast when she found out it was my birthday!) but there were some male waiters who seamed quite huffy and overly formal for breakfast by the ocean.

As you can probably tell, we can't wait to go back to the Halekulani (especially off peak season when it's a little more affordable and perhaps not so busy), and if you can afford it I would definitely recommend it.

Though overall the service here was good we experienced a few issues. On arrival we were escorted to our room to find twin beds. We requested a change and were met with laughter and ended with the beds pushed together. Unsatisfactory at these prices. The rooms have been renovated and are nice but very small even by local standards. The bathrooms are tiny and lack lighting. The pool area was crowded during our stay and service slow. We dined at both orchids and le mer. These two are probaly the best dining experience in hawaii and are not to be missed. The jazz bar of an evening was also pleasent but again we recieved poor service in here. The beach at the front of the hotel is very small, if you like the beach more than the pool the beach towards  the front of moana surfrider and outrigger is the best. 
Overall great for the dinning but left us disappointed for what we payed.","Date of stay: August 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

But things improved alot since then and we got suprised of how this hotel has developed from a nice, relaxing expirience to a truly unique luxury retreat. Especially the service and the friendliness of the staff has become outstanding. We had rented a car for our stay, and got greeted by our name everytime we entered the building or left it. Aswell as we once were heading to the beach, and they gave us more towels and water without us even having to ask. The same for the breakfast at the Orchids, you get greeted by your name and the food and service we were treated by were to quality! 
A very special recommondation, especially for couples, is the La Mer, right above the Orchids restaurant. We have never in our lives dined as amazingly as there. Our servers and the food was outstanding, and we wouldve given them a 11 out of 10 points!
So all in all, this hotel is a must-stay, if you can afford it!","Date of stay: August 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

From the moment we arrived I was whisked to the front desk, just to take my credit card imprint, and then escorted by a lovely hostess.  The hostess explained the entire hotel to us, the pool area, the restaurants, etc.  Upon arriving in our room, our bags were waiting, she explained the operation of the latest electronics and controls in our room, and opened the lanai to a breathtaking view of the pool, gardens and beach.  Perhaps the only drawback was that we could not see Diamond Head.  Then much to my surprise, she would not accept a gratuity.  The hotel provided two bottles of water daily, and the ice bucket was always full.

We had diner one evening at La Mer.  The meal was one of the most memorable of my life.  We have previously dined at many of the top rated restaurants in all corners of the world.

Perhaps the hotel’s best surprise was that they maintain and enforce a dress code.  This code kept the “sightseers’ away from the lobby, pool and other public areas which maintained the quiet dignity of the hotel.  The dress code required long sleeve button shirts and slacks for the two top restaurants.  The lobby and public areas required a collared shirt and covered shoes; no flip-flops.  The pool area was quiet, uncrowded and lounges were always available on either the pool concrete apron or a grass and tree lined garden.  Towels were brought by the attendants.  It’s no wonder that the Halekulani is favored by many celebrities, though I did not encounter any.

The concierge assisted with off-premise activities and dining, and when I approached for directions to the post office with a package, they anticipated my request, took the package and handled the mailing. 

The location is perfect, in the heart of Waikiki, near both the high end and low end shopping, and next door to the Sheraton Center.

Hopefully, I can return in the future.","Date of stay: July 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Everyone is very attentive and the reception area is pristeen and perfect, everything is creamy white and polished and the floral arrangements everywhere are unlike anything I have ever seen before. Service is always with big smiles, we were escorted to our room and the hotel layout was carefully explained to us. We were on the 15th floor overlooking the ocean and pool area and the view was breathtaking, we could see turtles in the water and the stage below was set for Miss Hawaii to Hula while a group of boys with angelic voices serenaded in their classic mellow tones, if this isn't Paradise then I haven't been there yet!
Our room was beautiful and we had chocolates and a plate of delicious fruit on the table, every night a special little gift was left on our pillow, something uniquely Halekulani Hawaiin!
The location of the hotel is perfect, right on the beach and with just a short walk to the Trolley station (buy a two day ticket and do all 3 lines, red, green and pink) It is  a five minute walk to wonderful shopping, Victoria's Secret, Coach, Saphora, and all the Gucci style fancies if you can afford it! There is a fantastic restaurant on every corner and we even walked to Alamoana Shopping Centre, quite a few times, as we are walkers by nature! The ABC shop is also just 2 minutes away if you want to get supplies. I loved that the Hotel provides free bottled water every day to your room and an ice bucket - filled fresh twice daily.
We loved the gift shop and the fact that this hotel has a dress code, very nice in this day and age!
We didn't eat in the restaurant as we had big days and were too tired but we did have room service twice and it was perfectly delicious, very generous serves of lovely fresh food.
Would highly recommend this hotel if you are after a bit of luxury and pampering and it is the perfect location!","Date of stay: July 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We booked an oceanfront room, but were shown to a partial oceanview room.  We showed our reservation and they brought us back down and the manager worked with us and made sure we had a room that met our request. In fact, they went above and beyond and upgraded us to a suite during our stay.  They rectified the problem immediately and followed up and made sure we were happy, which we were.  The suite was great and we had a wonderful view.  The bathroom was great and spacious with a walk-in closet, tub, shower with great water pressure, and a separate toilet room, with a bidet. Upon check in, you have papayas and bananas to greet you, as with our champagne as newlyweds.  And each day thereafter, you have a little keepsake gift on your bed. It's so cute.  They also provide complimentary bottled water each day.  I hate to sound unappreciative, but we weren't the biggest fans of the bottled water (deep ocean water), but very happy to receive nonetheless, and bought ""regular"" bottled water at the local ABC Store.

Pool:
Not the biggest pool, but not the smallest either.  It was perfect for the size of the hotel.  The staff there found us 2 chairs that met our request (one in the sun, and one in the shade) in the middle of the afternoon.  They even offer guests a frozen treat!  Clientele is great here if you're looking for a more serene, relaxing setting vs a young party crowd, which is exactly what we wanted.

Restaurant:
We ate at Orchids for dinner and a House without a Key for lunch and breakfast.  Both are great.  No complaints here.  You know this is the Halekulani and Hawaii, so you're expecting high prices (My crab sandwich was $22.).  You have Roy's and Denny's across the street as options too, plus many other restaurants in the walking distance as well.  (We walked to Egg N things for breakfast one day too which was pretty good and popular.)

Spa:
We had one of the best massages here.  We usually want firm pressure and oftentimes you don't get it depending on the strength of your massage therapist, but wow, this place, they mean firm pressure! I almost had to tap out!  They also provide you with complimentary toiletry items to freshen up.  This spa does not have saunas or steam rooms though and that's the only negative I have to say.  It's mainly just the massage.  They also provided us mochi ice cream as we sat outside after our massage as well.  

Overall, this is a very nice upscale hotel right on the beach. (Oh, speaking of beach, the public beach area in front of the hotel is very small.) You can tell the difference when you walk in here compared to other hotels.  It is very nice, quiet, comfortable, and their level of service is above all others in a very nice casual and subtle way.

We got a great special and looked forward to this for months.  We were not disappointed.  We were escorted to our room to complete check in.  We had a great room that overlooked the pool and the beach.  At night we would sit on our balcony enjoying the Hula dancing and music sipping our own champagne.  Every morning we went to the pool and had a coffee and bagel.  The staff didn't mind we brought some food with us as we would order drinks and stay for an early lunch by the pool.  In the heat they would offer us ice blocks and water.  The security guards were so well dressed and would keep a watchful eye! As I passed through the foyer, the staff would greet me by name! 

Every night we would rush home and look for our turn down treat.  We still have the key ring and note cards! Every night we were invited to an event in Wakiki.  We felt very special.

Beautifully laid out with very helpful and friendly staff.  We normally stay at the Kahala, on the other side of Diamond Head, but decided to try the Halekulani based on friends' comments.  Overall: a first class hotel.  
Pros: very calm and very quiet and very peaceful, almost amazingly so given the location right in the center of the Waikiki crowds.  Staff friendly and unobtrusive.  Breakfast at Orchid's (the non-buffet option) was quite nice.
Cons: we had business in Honolulu and found access in and out very difficult.  Traffic in Waikiki, both vehicular and pedestrian, is a nightmare.  The room we were first given was right on the outside street, with a lanai overlooking the traffic.  The staff did move us, without protest, to a nicer room (albeit a ""disabled access"" room) but given we were paying ""rack rate"" a better room right off the bat would have been nice.  Plus, we had an unexpected ""high season rate change"" on arrival--enough of a difference from the rate quoted when we booked that we might have booked elsewhere.  One would think a hotel of this caliber would honor its reservations.  That was a sour note.","Date of stay: August 2012","Trip type: Traveled on business","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Hotel not much to look at from curb but very open and casual classy inside. Bell hops were very efficient and friendly.This was the end of our 25th anniversary trip with kids 22,21,17 and 15 which started at Disney's Aulani 2 nights, Pride of America Cruise, and now here. Great relaxing end to this trip of a lifetime. Very convienent location across from great shopping and a great ABC store with everything in it and cheap breakfast also across the street.  House without a Key was nice to have some eats and a drink and watch  a nice hawaiian show. Musicians were great. One of the things that the high prices were paying for I'm sure. In June the sun was in your eyes until it set if you were to the left of the stage. Get to the right of it so sun would be at your back. All remodled rooms were neat with fancy ultimate controler for lights, front desk assistance, and other stuff I never really knew was there till we left. Oh well.The sliding louver doors for curtains was a neat idea and attractive. Also  if open a door in bathroom you could see Diamond Head from there.  The views  and ambiance of the suite was worth the high prices. Again ,once in a lifetime experience and in this case you get  what you pay for. Nice we could all stay together. Just two comfortable beds in suite but two rollaways took care of the sleeping arrangement.  Suite had two bedrooms connected to a living space room  each had it's own balcony. The balconies were not connected. My son liked sitting out there with his laptop . Wifey loved the shopping strip with all the tiki torches lit at night. The girls walked to the Waikiki Shell for a Jason Mraz concert while we were there so very convenient for that as well. Nice little night time gifts on  bed  impressed Wifey. The hotel let us stay till 2pm late checkout in one of the rooms at no extra charge. No beach to speak of but not a problem for us since we  went surfing  with Hawaiin Fire Surf and had enough beach and sun.Everyone hated to leave this hotel and someday will return I'm sure!

The hotel is unbeatable in comfort, luxury, location, restaurants and staff. My very first visit to Honolulu was with the Halekulani and I honestly can't find a reason to try any other hotel. My first stay was in May of 2011 and I returned to stay again in October of 2011. 

The room we stayed in had a lanai facing the gorgeous Hawaiian ocean view. The room itself was spacious and clean. My husband and I spent a lot of our time sitting out on the lanai just taking in the view. There was scarcely any time when the glass doors had to be shut for the AC to turn on. The weather and ocean breeze is just perfect! Right around dinner time, a live band will start to play. So if you're the type to nap well into dinner time and you're a light sleeper, you may want to shut the glass doors, but otherwise I found the Hawaiian music to be calm and a very nice touch. The beds and furniture are as you would expect from an older hotel, but it is by no means run down. The hotel has Japanese origins so the design of the entire hotel is quite comfortably and tastefully monochromatic and simple. If you want a very quiet and relaxing hotel for your vacation, this is for you. If you want the ultra-contemporary and luxe-modern experience, this isn't going to fulfill your needs.

The staff and the concierge are all very helpful. They helped us make dinner arrangements both on and off the hotel grounds, including transportation. 

The hotel is walking distance from convenience shops, souvenir shops, restaurants, malls, etc. It's quite centrally located. Anywhere you go, if you just ask how to get back to the Halekulani, people will know what and where you mean. The hotel has been around a few decades and has a stellar reputation.

We dined at La Mer for dinner both times we stayed at the Halekulani (reservations required and are limited). The fare is as advertised, Neoclassic French. My husband likes French cuisine while I am not a huge fan. Even so, the menu had something for everyone and I always had a good time. It's pricey, but quite worth it if you are celebrating a special occasion. The atmosphere is quiet and romantic, especially if you are seated by the window, right next to the ocean. 

If you stay at the Halekulani for a weekend, you will absolutely not want to miss the brunch at Orchids. (Unfortunately I do not remember if we had to make reservations for this. If you want to go, it's best to ask and reserve because they do get quite busy) The Sunday brunch buffet is insanely delicious. When we went in May we happened to run into Mother's Day weekend and the price of the brunch per person was hiked up, but even so both my husband and I felt that it was very much worth the price. The plates of food never seem to end. There's even some traditional Japanese breakfast fare, sushi rolls and salads. Everything from omelettes to roasted meats is available. The dessert spread is unbelievable as well. Make sure that you do not miss out on the signature Halekulani coconut cake!!!! On a regular day if you order a slice at Orchids, this slice of heaven will cost you ~$7. On Sunday  mornings I fill my heart with this cake! People come from other hotels and even residents on the island come to Orchids for their brunch. If you are given the option, ask to be seated outside so you can eat by the ocean.","Date of stay: October 2011","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The property is beautiful, the staff are superb, the rooms are lovely, the view is stunning, the pool is inviting and the food is delicious.  We loved our ocean front room.  The bathroom was quite pretty, the robes were comfortable, the bed was perfect, the linens were soft, and our experience was unbeatable.  We were initially in an ocean view room but later in the day upgraded to the ocean front.  While I  would have been happy in the first room, the ocean front was awesome.  We were personally escorted by the reception staff to our room and given information on all of the hotel amenities. The room was not overly large, but the space was well arranged and the furnishings serene.  The lobby and the grounds are gorgeous,  the valet were very helpful and professional.  The concierge was excellent.  My husband and I both received fabulous treatments in the spa.  One of the things I really liked is the location.  You are right on Waikiki Beach but this location is rather quiet.  You can walk about one block and be right in the thick of all the excitement of Waikiki and then when you return to the Halekulani you walk into a serene and peaceful space that is so calming and relaxing.  You really feel pampered by the staff.  All of the service was superior with the exception of the pool staff.  They do not seem to have enough staff there and one of the guys appeared harried and gave us the impression our drink order was an imposition.  Also, a couple of times I could not find anyone to help me get chairs and towels.  There is not much beach in front of the hotel but this did not bother us at all.  The water was perfect.  If I had small children I would probably not stay here as there is only one pool and no children's activities.  For an adult couple, however, it was heaven.

It was ok but nothing special for the price we were paying ($1600.00 per night for 2 joining rooms)The view was amazing but the hotel seems a little  run down and out dated. We ended up changing hotels because we needed more space for our 1 year old (rooms are very small) and we would wake him up every time we used the bathroom. The door sectioning off the bedroom to the bathroom is very open and not sound proof at all. We decided to check out earlier and  move to The Trump Hotel where the apartment style rooms are huge for $1000.00 per night. The Only other things that were disappointing were the size of the beach area and the gym was small too.
A few days after we checked out I looked at my bank statement and The Halekulani had taken a hold of over $4000.00 on my credit card, when I went in and asked them about it they could not give me an answer (Jane was the lady at cashier this day) as to why it had been taken after we had checked out as they had already taken a hold when we first checked in. I needed the money to pay for our new hotel so i was not happy. After many phone calls between the hotel and my bank, the money was finally released. I still do not understand why they took more money after I had paid my bill and the money cleared from my bank and if I hadn't have checked my bank statement were they even going to release it? 
Lucky we have ended our trip on a good note across the road at Trump! Maybe if you are willing to spend thousands per night you could have a nicer experience at this hotel.","Date of stay: July 2012","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

Yes, you will pay a premium to stay at the Halekulani, but I don't think I could stay at another hotel in Waikiki after staying here.  

So why do I give this property a 4 instead of a 5?  

We had an ocean front category room, which had a terrific view from the balcony, but we were in the corner of the floor, so from much of the room the view was of other people's balconies.  I wasn't super happy about that.  If you are going to book the ocean front category, I suggest you ask for a room somewhere in the middle of the building.  

Also, the air conditioning was shockingly weak in the middle of the night.  Our room often felt stuffy.  After two nights, we called the front desk, and they sent someone to override some of the default settings, which really helped.  But still.  I'm not into super-intense A/C, but at the same time, when you're paying what you pay at the Halekulani, I think you should be able to set the temperature to be as cold as you want.  

Management was very responsive to the issues we had, which is why I will absolutely return to this hotel.  They really helped to smooth things over when we had some minor issues.  Wayne, the front desk manager, was especially great in this regard. 

One of my favorite things to do while at the hotel was open our balcony door before dinner and listen to the trio playing Hawaiian music at House Without a Key.

I had looked at a few of the other hotels around like the Moana Surfrider and the Royal Hawaiian and the Trump, but stayed here because largely the pool area seemed to be much better.  It was!  It truly is an oasis of relaxation in the midst of a rather busy and crowded area (Waikiki).  We felt like we were isolated away from that busy area.  Some may knock the fact that there really is no sand beach in front of the hotel, but we felt that was not a drawback because all of the other hotels to the east that do have sand have crowds of people on them.  Rooms are nice, though small.  The hotel definitely caters to the Asian tourists but this had no bearing on us or the quality of our stay.  Try to get the breakfast package; the buffet each morning was awesome.  I will certainly be back.","Date of stay: July 2012","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Not really.","I don't understand what people find so wonderful about this hotel. I think it's just average. The property feels very old and icky, and the room was totally average. Don't get me wrong- it's a comfortable stay but you can get this kind of hotel experience at almost any other hotel in a major city. 

The room was decent. It was nice, has an ocean view, but it was just average and how could this be worth so much? The room was old, too. It didn't feel quaint or charming. It felt old and like it needed a major redecorating session. 

One thing that bothered me about this hotel was the staff. They were nice but as a newly wed, I kept my name. And when I corrected the staff of my name being different from my husband's they insisted that they had updated my info in their system and yet every time I called from the room, I was greeted with Mrs. ""husband's name."" Same thing when I checked out. Normally I wouldn't really care to raise this, but given that this hotel is rated as Hawaii's too and classiest, sharpest hotel, I was not impressed. Get my name right! I have a very easy last name and i fiund this lack of attention to detail for this price to be annoying.

Time just seems to slow down, in a most delightful way, the moment you step into the hotel.  The property is elegant, in an understated way, and we did not want to leave.  We stayed with our 7-year old daughter and she loved it too.  The checkin is as all hotels should do it.  They quickly wisk you up to your room, and they handle the checkin there.  Professional, friendly and reserved is how I would describe the entire staff.  The shower was so amazing I wrote down the brand to buy it for my home.  Fantastic water pressure from the shower head, and a hand held wand to clean the sand off your legs from the beach.  The bedding and toiletries were nice, and the food service is lovely too.  We got a room with a Diamond Head and Ocean view. The only down side was that we looked over the roof top of the restaurant buildings and we could not see the pool, or hear the singing from the House Without a Key.  We have stayed before on the other side of the hotel, where we had a view of the pool and the floor show, and I much preferred that.  In the early evening they have a hula dancer and band playing Hawaiian music, and it is legendary in Waikiki.  The breakfast buffet in the morning is predictable and just OK.  Orchids is their nicer restaurant and we were pleasantly surprised to see that the restaurant does not use genetically modified foods.  The staff there was impeccable, and the food and beverage was extremely memorable.  We can’t say enough about how much we loved Orchids.  We took our daughter upstairs to La Mer, and we did not think it was worth the time and money. The tasting menu is the same price for our 7 year old as it was for us, and that seemed silly.  I did the wine pairing, and I did not think the wines lived up to the food.  The service was slow and not very good.  Several staff members were arguing throughout the night in the service area next to our table and that didn’t help the night.  The food was beautiful, but not memorable. Maybe we are just over tasting menus and a staff that makes it a big “to-do” but the decor is beautiful.  We did eat one night at the House Without a Key, and it wasn’t that great.  They have the music entertainment, so the hostess and staff seemed a little overwhelmed with the sudden crowd.  It’s fine for a simple breakfast or quick lunch, but its not up to the standards set by the rest of the hotel.

The hotel is on the beach, but they dont have one.  The pool and lounging area goes all the way to the walkway, so the hotel does not have a private beach area.  There is a very small area of sand before the water, so dont plan on laying on the beach, unless you want to lay in the public area without hotel service.  We had to use the table and chairs around the pool, and walk to the beach to swim in the water.  It’s not ideal, but we just love the hotel so much, we are willing to overlook that part.

We love the Halekulani, and there’s a certain vibe there that makes you feel so relaxed and cared for.  We think it’s worth every penny.","Date of stay: July 2012","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Waikiki is a very busy, active vacation location.  The entrance to this hotel is 100 from all the hustle and bustle but once you enter the property you enter another world.  Everything is spotless, open, quiet and welcoming.  The rooms are huge in immaculate condition with large comfortable lanai's.  Big bathrooms.  Beautiful pool area with the ocean right there.  While there is not a lot of sandy beach in front the swimming is great.  I think years ago someone dug up the coral and created this sandy bottom area that goes straight out into the sea.  Perfect for ocean swimming.  In the afternoon the turtles came in and it was so much fun to snorkel with these majestic animals.  Something I will never forget.
The staff could not have been friendlier and they seemed to anticipate my wife's every wish.  The food was excellent and at 5:30 a band started playing hawaiian music.  We just sat on our lanai and listened to them play while we drank our Mai Tai's  
The Halekulani is expensive but given the incredible experience it is truly worth the extra money.  There is no better hotel in Hawaii given this place's central location.  To top it off we found the ocean water much cleaner than just down the beach in front of the Royal Hawaiian.","Date of stay: July 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

This year I decided on a ""mini-vacation"" over the Independence Day holiday, and booked an ocean view room.

At first I was a bit disappointed that I didn't have a view of Diamond Head, as the Sheraton Waikiki took up a huge amount of said view, but outside of that our experience was first rate!  The room was large, sunny, and with a stunning view except as noted above.  The bathroom was simply out of this world!  It included a deep soaking tub, a separate shower with one of those huge rain shower heads, and a separate toilet.  All the amenities were included in this bathroom, including a walk in closet through which you could walk into the room and from which you could enjoy the view (which unfortunately was completely the Sheraton Waikiki).  The bed was extremely comfortable, comparable to any of the ""heavenly beds"" of other hotel brands.  As I said, the room was very large, and you felt completely at ease with all that space.  There was a big high-definition TV with loads of channels, phones all over the place (the bathroom, the toilet, by the bed, at the desk, etc.) and you felt that you always had lots of communication.  There was free WiFi access, although we ended up  not using it, not having brought the computer.  There was a spacious lanai outside, where you would have plenty of room to eat, laze, enjoy the view, etc.  In short, there was nothing lacking in this room.

Room service was quick and easy, and the servers went out of their way to tell you that service and gratuity were included.  We ordered an early morning breakfast to be served at 6:00 a.m., and it was served ON THE DOT!  The service ware was elegant and of the best quality.

The same elegance is found in the restaurants at the Halekulani.  We ate at Orchids, which is their first-floor dining room, and it's excellent.  The food, the service, the ambiance just couldn't be improved upon, except possibly at their La Mer restaurant on the second floor which is their top of the line dining room.  

If I were forced to make any criticism, I would say that the walls seemed a bit thin, as we heard the  next door neighbors shouting and screaming because of the holiday.  Luckily, though, they didn't go on too late, and with the use of an earplug the noise was minimal.

The Halekulani spa is just what you'd imagine an elegant, first class spa to be.  I went for a deep tissue massage, and it was given in a beautiful, well equipped room with soft music, lovely fragrances and a very expert masseur.  I definitely recommend this place.  It made my day and was just perfect.  If you go to this facility, I would suggest you request Brian Ikeda as your massage therapist.  He did his best to make me feel pampered and well taken care of.  Superior in every way!

I know this is not a cheap place to stay, but it's certainly worth it.  My highest recommendation!","Date of stay: July 2012","Trip type: Traveled with friends","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Spent three nights here after checking out early from the Royal Hawaiian early (small, dark rooms and 3 star-not 5 star service- at 5 star price). It was worth every penny and was definitely the way to end our trip. We loved it so much we paid the half day rate so that we could stay in our room until our red eye left on the last night. The Diamond Head view room was incredible. Quite frankly we didn't want to leave the room. Our first night we had drinks and dinner on our Lanai and listened to the music below and if it weren't for my foodie instincts to get out there and try other restaurants we could have been very happy doing that each night. What a unique room service experience. Better view than any restaurant can provide you on the whole island. If you are looking to take that special trip with your wife/husband and you can stretch your dollars a stay here and at the Kahala will leave you with memories that are hard to beat.

Upon check in, we were given a personal tour of the grounds by our reception clerk.  She pointed out the restaurants, lounge bar, pool and access to the beach.  The high point of the tour was when she opened the door of our room and we saw our view.  Truly amazing!  180 degree view of the water and diamond head.  We spent most nights with the slider door open so we could hear the waves crash as we slept.  The rooms are very tastefully, and luxuriously, appointed but without going overboard.  They all have a very nice lanai where you can sit and enjoy the view.  The staff were all fantastic, and even knew our names after a couple of days.  Sitting in the pool area, we were treated to complimentary ice cream bars and ice cold towels every afternoon.  

The only issues we had, and they are nitpicky, are the following:  Wish we could see the ocean from the pool area, they need a jacuzzi/hot tub, and the furniture layout of the rooms should be reversed so you can enjoy the ocean views from the bed.  The grounds are so beautiful, quiet, and peaceful that you really dont feel that you are in Waikiki at all!  I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone who wants to stay in Waikiki for the nightlife, but still wants a quiet place to stay!

As a travel agent & tour guide I am very fortunate to experience many beautiful & not so beautiful places around the world. Our recent 4 night stay in an ocean view room at the Halekulani has made me fall in love with Hawaii all over again. The place you choose to stay can make all the difference in how much you enjoy your holiday, never think it is just somewhere to sleep!

The Halekulani is sophisticated elegance amongst many other loud and crowded hotels. The rooms are large light and airy, the balconies are large with a sun lounge & table & chairs to sit out and enjoy the view. The beds are very good and have beautiful linen on them; there are many towels in your room that are large and fluffy with robes to match. 

The restaurants are very good and all have beautiful views of the ocean and beach. Each night they have Hawaiian singers & dancing from 5.30pm to enjoy. We sat on our balcony each night and enjoyed the singing from beneath enjoying a private drink and loved every minute of it.

The Halekulaini is to be congratulated on their eye for detail, the flowers all around the hotel are beautiful, the fragrance makes you feel like you are in a very special place from the minute you walk in. The staffs are always welcoming and smiling and go out of their way to make you feel like you are their only guest. The large areas of open grass add to the feeling of space for each guest, and allow you to enjoy the ambiance of the hotel, were others have build on every last inch.

One of the big things with this hotel is that even when it is fully booked, as it was during our stay it never looks like there are many people here. No waiting in line. There are always lots of sun lounges that are set up for you, with a big white towel laid beneath you, and then another over the top. The sun lounges are padded so you really enjoy lying by the beautiful pool with its mosaic orchid beneath an exquisite touch. You are walking distance to everything but hidden in this tranquil oasis unless you choose to venture out.

We will be back to Hawaii in April next year with friends and we will be staying at the Halekulanini again. We had a good look at all the other hotels on Waikiki beach and none gave us the feeling of class, style sophistication that this hotel offers, you will not be disappointed in this hotel.","Date of stay: June 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

2.  No tea pot or coffee maker in the room.  You would think that for a room that cost 500+ per night they'd give you something like that.  The room itself is pretty but it's nothing special, definitely not worth that much money. 

3.  Pool is very beautiful and poolside service is very good.

4.  The hotel security looks like they are about to beat you up if you do anything wrong.  Scary. 

5.  The restaurants:  ""House without a key"" gives you an amazing experience plus the best Hawaiian music on Oahu, the probably the best Mai Tai on the island.  ""La Mer"" is by far the best restaurant on Waikiki, probably the best in the state of Hawaii.  Prepare to have the meal of your life.  Every bite is exquisite.

6.  The gym is abysmal, pretty much nonexistent.  You're better off running outside.","Date of stay: July 2011","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

It's pretty quiet compared to the other hotels in the area, which we loved.  The staff couldn't have been nicer...very warm and friendly and full of aloha spirit.  They treat everyone like a VIP, and not just if you're in the Presidential suite...very unpretentious service!
Our room was quite roomy and just lovely, all in soothing blues and beiges.  The bathrooms are roomy with a very large closet...plenty of storage.  There is every amenity you can think of from a jewelry/coin valet in the safe to hand washables powder!
In addition to a nice fitness room, they offer a couple complimentary fitness classes each morning from yoga to aqua aerobics.  Everything is included at this resort...no extra fees for little things like fitness classes or beach chairs.  Just check them out & go.  The pool guys even brought the towels & chairs to our car and sent us way with a couple bottles of water also.
The food was outstanding in every outlet we ate at, even room service!  The spa is small and intimate.  Although they don't have amenities like a hot tub or sauna, I had a great Lomi Lomi massage and enjoyed the relaxation patio while drinking delicious pineapple/coconut tea and munching on Mochi (Japanese ice cream) while listening to the music coming from House without a Key...a perfect spa experience.  Make sure to have drinks at House without a Key...it's a the perfect setting to listen to Hawaiian music while enjoying the sunset. 
Anything you can think of, Halekulani already has!  You'll feel truly spoiled...this hotel is definitely worth a splurge!  If they had higher scores to give, I would give them!","Date of stay: May 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The hotel is gorgeous and it is in a great location. It is very close to restaurants and shops. The rooms are lovely as they have been recently renovated and they are bright and airy. The view from the ocean front room is of the splendid orchid pool and the ocean. My husband and I loved the evenings sitting out on the balcony and listening to the live Hawaiian music coming from House Without a Key. Very relaxing. 

The beach in front of the hotel is small but very close to the pool area, so we asked for poolside chairs to set-up first and then went and swam in the ocean, came back after and lounged by the pool with some great drinks. My favourite drink was the 'Le Mint' (which comes in virgin or alcoholic form). Just divine! 

We had some issues during our stay but they all got fixed promptly, though it spoils the relaxed holiday feel. The new shower taps are difficult to operate when you have wet/soapy hands. I had to call my husband for help to switch between the overhead and handheld shower heads. The shower water pressure is fantastic though!

Dinner was good at the House Without a Key and great at Orchids. You have to try the Coconut Cake (available at both (all?) restaurants at Halekulani). It is very light and very delicious! 

The breakfast for us unfortunately was a different story. We tried the buffet breakfast at the House Without a Key and it was awful. The choice and quality of the food was average and service was not good. We also ordered room service breakfast. My husband's Bircher muesli seemed to be a little off (tasted 'fizzy') and my eggs Benedict were disappointing: Canadian bacon extremely salty and poached eggs tasting like vinegar! Not sure if it is just because of the renovations, but you could also not order a la carte breakfast unless you ordered room service. Very strange. The Royal Hawaiian just next door had a great breakfast and their poached eggs are good and most importantly do not taste like vinegar! 

For Aussies: fresh juice on the menus generally does not mean freshly squeezed on site, it is juice out of a box. The only fresh thing about it is that it is served to you before the expiry date. You will be paying $7-8 for boxed juice. Not 5 star!

Overall a great stay and loved it!","Date of stay: May 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Room was 'old' and worn, view was of a most ugly high rise next door, only one elevator for an entire building, staff seemed disorganized, public areas very sterile feeling, hallways outside of rooms were creepy and plain, dinner was a disaster - food nearly inedible.

Friendly and helpful staff all around the resort. That doesn't just include the Concierges, who were always helpful and kind whenever we had a question, but also the front desk (probably one of the easiest check outs ever), the doormen, the pool staff and people just wandering around the resort. Even security are friendly and kind.

As for the rooms, they are wonderful, spacious refurbished rooms with clean, modern appliances.  I imagine that you would have wonderful views from most rooms in the hotel as it overlooks the beach from both sides.

There is a small beach just in front of the hotel which is clean and has plenty of room, meanwhile the pool is a good size with staff that will look after you all day.

Obviously the Halekulani is a little more expensive than other resorts, but you get what you pay for here, first class service and rooms.

Just a couple of comments; I think that the beds are good - not excellent like the rest of the resort - but perhaps this is something the Halekulani might consider looking at in the future. They were a little too soft for our liking.

Also, the Spa is very overpriced. My girlfriend had a one hour massage treatment and paid $220 for that; and apparently only had 40-45 minutes of an actual massage. The quality was OK.

Thank you to the staff at the Halekulani for making our stay so comfortable and we will be back again soon.","Date of stay: May 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

things about this hotel so my anticipation was high. Unfortunately our 
experience was not very good. We had an ocean front room which was blocked on 
one side by the massive Sheraton hotel and on other side by hundreds of rooms 
with balcony and zero privacy. Sitting on balcony felt like whole world is 
watching you. The room as as small as it can get, old furniture. Closet opens up 
from bathroom and bedroom, a strange set up. Only one small sink in bathroom. It 
seems mattress was years old and springs were gone. We called and it was 
replaced by a nice firm mattress. Sink did
not drain and so we called to have that fixed but problem remained. Safe 
malfunctioned 3 times. We were told our room had a soft renovation. Amazing a 
hotel which charged us $700 plus each day left all these issues alone. All this 
happened within 3 hours of our arrival. We requested a change to even a lower 
category room like an ocean view room, we were told nicely that it will be done 
but it never happened despite my meeting their manager on duty twice a day. It 
seems management is very polite but not interested in keeping customers happy. 
There is no bar area outside near the pool. In the evening we had to sit in 
outside restaurant to get drinks served. Restaurant food was very good but we had to 
wait for 30 minutes though we had reservation. In summary, a very disappointing 
stay.","Date of stay: May 2012","Trip type: Traveled on business","ui_bubble_rating bubble_20"

The rooms were renovated a few years ago so they are quite new overall. The check in lobby seems a bit simple and small given the class of the hotel. They don't even have a  chair in the lobby for guests. The lifts for guest rooms is in such a way that I thought it was a cargo lift and not sure if it is for guests.

But once inside the room it is a whole different world. It is new and decent. The lanai is side facing the beach, with a lounge chair, a chair and a tea table. My room included a tea table, stool, a writing desk and a  sofa. Bathroom is spacious, with separate shower and bathtub. The back of the wardrobe is interesting that it is infact a sliding door that open the way into the bathroom.

I would rate the service of the hotel to be excellent. I asked for some toiletry from housekeeping and they delivered to my room, then I let go of the door thinking that it would shut by itself. It didn't. After some minutes a hotel staff knocked on my door and asked me to shut the door. Then after about half an hour a hotel technician came to fix the door closers. I was impressed with such service and attitude.

Orchids, the breakfast restaurant is by the pool and the lawn. The service  is excellent, food is fine. The pool is not big, as in the case of most hotels on Waikiki. There is a small strip of pedestrian way beside the hotel lawn where quite many people walking all the time, so it is kind of busy most of the time. The beach attached to the hotel is relatively small, so if the guests wanted to swim on the beach, this is not a perfect choice. 

I came across a few couples having their wedding in the hotel and I agree that it is a wise choice to choose this hotel for wedding.

If you are looking for a decent hotel on Waikiki, this is probably the best choice.","Date of stay: April 2012","Trip type: Traveled on business","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

But I have to say after staying at Halekulani for 5 nights and looking at the other hotels nearby, this is still the best hotel in Waikiki, hands down. 

We have stayed in some nice hotels around the world and Halekulani service was second to none. Knowing how big the hotel is and how many rooms they have, I could not comprehend how they can maintain such a high level of service for all guests. I was genuinely impressed by the service staff and the overall service at the hotel. 

Reception/Check-in staff was courteous, attentive and warm. Service staff at the hotel entrance was equally courteous and always looking to help. Staff at the restaurants/pool area/ souvenir shop/security staff all were impressive and always with a smile. I went for a run one morning and got back and the security staff came over and asked how was the run and chatted for 5 mins giving me recommendation on running paths for the next day. Now thats attention to detail. We spent 4 nights first and left for Maui and returned back to Halekulani after 5 days and all the staff remembered us and welcomed us back to the hotel. Very impressive service standards.

We stayed in two different categories of room in our stay, once in the Oceanfront room and the second time in the Diamond head view room. Both were nice with some great views of the beach and very elegantly done. I think elegant touch is the touch they are going for and they have got it right. The rooms were comfortable, decent sized for a resort hotel with nice amenities. The evening turn down service present was a nice touch.

Location of the hotel is prime, beautiful ocean view all around with nice gardens surrounding the hotel. It's close proximity to shopping areas, ABC store, starbucks all makes up for convenient location. Beach in front of the hotel is not big, but the pool area is lovely and makes it up for it.

We had dinner twice at Orchids and all the dishes we tried were very nice and they seem to use local produce to a large extent and that is reflected in the fresh taste. Service again at the restaurant was top notch. We tried the famous Halekulani Sunday brunch and that was a real gastronomic treat.

My fiance and I stayed at the Halekulani for four nights/five days in June 2011.  It was our five year anniversary and we decided to take a short getaway to Hawaii to celebrate.  My fiance chose the Halekulani hotel for us and, after looking at the beautiful pictures and reading spectacular reviews, I decided it was an amazing choice.

We chose an ocean view room to stay in (it's Hawaii...who wants the garden view?) and were super excited to say the very least.  We paid around $600 a night, but after looking at pictures and reading the reviews, we decided it was well worth it (this is a great deal of money to us, lol, considering we mostly stay at La Quinta and Holiday Inn types).  We also had saved up about a thousand bucks for spending cash..

We arrived in Hawaii after an exhausting eight hour flight.  We rode the shuttle bus to the hotel and on our way there we saw our first Hawaii rainbow!  Silly, I know, but I loved it.  There was a ""tour guide"" of sorts on the shuttle who pointed out a few things on the way.  We finally arrived at the hotel about 25-30 minutes later (if you can afford it, I would arrange for private transportation to the hotel so you don't have to stop at EVERY hotel on the way to drop people off - it gets annoying after the second hotel).  When we pulled up, I noticed how relaxed and open everything was - it was nice.  

Now, this is where things started to go downhill, and really set the tone for the rest of our vacation.  Remember, we had never stayed in anything remotely as ""luxurious"" or ""grand"" as this hotel.  At the front desk, they asked for a credit card.  I didn't know what they needed it for so I asked if it needed to be the same one we booked the hotel with and they said no.  We didn't bring any credit cards with us so as to keep us from overspending - which is easy to do on vacation.  I gave them my debit card from our Hawaii spending account which had $1000 on it - it's all we had brought (our bad!).  They swipe it - I'm assuming it must be needed for damages to the room or security or whatever.  We get up to the room, they do the final check-in, and then they leave.  My fiance decided to check our account - not sure why - but as soon as he did, he asked me, ""What's this $600 charge from the Halekulani?""  I had no idea, but sure enough there was a pending charge from the Halekulani for $600.  I called the front desk to ask what it was and they said it was a security deposit and when we checked out of the hotel the charge would drop off.  Well that would be fantastic if we had used an actual credit card instead of our debit card.  There was a hold placed on 600 bucks of our spending money.  So bottom line, we only had $400 left.  DO NOT USE A DEBIT CARD FOR THE SECURITY DEPOSIT IF YOU ARE PLANNING ON USING THAT MONEY WHILE YOU ARE STAYING AT THE HOTEL.  This was definitely our fault, but we still had no idea they charged that kind of deposit and were caught off guard.  Fancy hotel lesson learned the hard way..ugh.  Over half of our money was gone, so to speak, and we hadn't even been there 2 hours!    

There was fresh fruit waiting on us which my fiance at ALL of while I was in the shower (I still can't believe he did that).  There has been a lot of humbug about the rooms on this site and well, it's all true.  The rooms do look very outdated.  For how much they charge you per night, you expect something special about the rooms, but it's about the size of your average hotel room, and the amenities are very UNDER-average for the price.  There is absolutely nothing special about the room or the bathroom.  I give the rooms a 4/10.  Our room was clean though and didn't have a musty odor like some other reviewers.  The bed was clean and comfortable also and we had a fantastic view of the hotel pool and the ocean. 

The first morning we went to the hotel beach.  Incredibly disappointing.  It was TINY, I'm serious, TINY.  Very few loungers (like 8) and just the tiniest spot of beach I'd ever seen.  I give the beach a 2/10.  I had a nice time watching my fiance though because he'd never been in the ocean before and was having a great time.

Over the course of the next few days, our experience with this hotel was ""just okay.""  I didn't find anything special about it.  Everything was over-priced (a bagel with cream cheese for seven bucks?!  And a pitcher of ice tea for $23?!  Are they being serious right now?).  We had room service quite a bit because we could use that $600 that they had a hold on.  We had the Traditional Japanese breakfast the first morning.  It was fresh fish with rice and miso soup and some other odds and ends.  It was pretty good, and the presentation was excellent.  Room service was very expensive though (see bagel and ice tea above).  We ate breakfast at House Without a Key one day and it was 30 bucks per person..for breakfast..60 bucks for breakfast..ridiculous and average.  We had reservations at Orchids the last night of our vacation and we got the fish for two plate.  It was expensive and average.  We didn't dine at La Mer - their premiere restaurant - but I felt like it was going to be average as well.

HOWEVER, The Lewer's Lounge was one of our favorite parts of our vacation.  It had such a great atmosphere and wonderful drinks and service.  We went there twice and loved it both times.  The waiters and waitresses were very attentive when they needed to be and no one bothered you.  They had comfortable couches to sit on and we just chatted and drank - it was perfect.

We didn't do very much while we were there because we didn't have access to our money, but we had prepaid for a few things.  We did the Star of Honolulu dinner cruise.  There was a steak and lobster dinner and it was a WHOLE lobster with EYES!  Yikes!  I let my fiance eat both of our lobsters haha.  It was kinda cheesy and there were some stupid drunk people on the boat but we got some great pictures.  We also did The Royal Hawaiian Luau.  If I could have a redo, I would have chosen a different luau.  It was kinda boring and the food was so-so.  Plus it was at the Royal Hawaiian hotel in their ""backyard"" which bordered the beach area so everyone on the beach stayed and watched the entire show for FREE and we paid $150 per person for it.  Granted they didn't get any food or drinks from the open bar but it was still irritating.  They should block off that section of the beach or figure out something to prevent people from doing that.  We got a few good pictures there.

So all in all - it was an average and sometimes disappointing vacation.  Our view was a little skewered from the beginning, but I think even if we had all the money in the world, this hotel STILL wouldn't have been up to par for me considering we paid over two grand for just the hotel.  Average rooms, overly expensive restaurants and room service for somewhat average food and drink (with the exception of The Lewer's Lounge), tiny beach..eh.  So like the title of my review..this hotel is okay.  Not great, not terrible, but just okay - average.  

I would love to go back and get a do-over.  I would not stay in Waikiki and would definitely not stay at the Halekulani.  I would probably stay at Turtle Bay if I had to stay on Oahu, but when we go back, we have already decided we are staying at the Four Seasons on Maui.  Can't wait!!  Sorry the review is so long - if you stayed and endured with me through the whole thing thank you! :)","Date of stay: June 2011","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

We like it so much we spent our honeymoon here and have returned every five years.  We just celebrated our 15th wedding anniversary here several weeks ago and had a good time.  But when a hotel makes a point of saying--at every turn--how ""perfect"" it is, it sets such a high standard that any minor flaw seems glaring.  For instance, on all previous stays at this hotel the lobby staff would pass out bottles of water to guests who were leaving on tours or just walking around Honolulu.  This really set the hotel apart from all others--a really nice gesture that has been discontinued.  They still have a large contingent of staff at the front, but unless they are parking cars they just seem to be milling around.  Also, I was surprised that the food quality has also declined.  Our room rate included either a buffet breakfast of a full American breakfast.  On our first morning we had a buffet breakfast at the House Without a Key restaurant and it was a major disappointment.  Coffee was served very weak and only lukewarm.  The variety of food was okay but nothing tasted really good.  What was really shocking was that the breads and pastries were all lined up on platters covered with white napkins!!  I know they have a problem with birds swooping down and stealing the bread, but really.  A five-star hotel cannot afford to buy covered see through platters available at any restaurant supply store? Any time you would lift the napkin to try and see what was underneath a staffer would rush up and cover it up! The next morning we decided to have a full American breakfast at Orchids which was fantastic.  The macadamia nut pancakes were fabulous, but again while the breakfast was part of our room rate, they charged us for coffee and juice.  Really petty and not worthy of ""The House Beffitting Heaven.""  Otherwise service is still top notch at this hotel.  We appreciated the in-room check in.  Really great especially after a 10-hour flight!  The pool here has never been a high point-way too small but since the beach is just steps away it isn't an inconvenience.  Rooms are spacious and relaxing with wonderful terraces overlooking the ocean.  There is a certain calmness to this hotel which is much appreciated after a hectic day on the tourist packed streets of Honolulu.  Will we return to the Halekulani again?

It just feels right.  It's comfortable, well located, and the rooms are super comfortable.  The beach is tiny but we preferred it to the pool.  Because of it's small size the hotel is able to keep it sandy, which was unusual to find in our hawaii travels which included four islands over two weeks.  And your location keeps you connected to the town as well, which has nice shopping and good restaurants.  The restaurant at the Hotel was very good but expensive so walk into town and eat like the locals for much less. The setting of the restaurant is the real draw anyway as it overlooks the ocean.  

They put on a wonderful show in the evenings out on the lawn.  We are able to enjoy it from the deck of our room as well because tables are crowded and we have a young child.","Date of stay: July 2011","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

I have been staying at Halekulani for over 20 years whenever we are in Hawaii. And it just never disappoints. The service is outstanding. It is elegant, quiet and understated. If you are looking for glitz, this isn't the place for you. But for those who enjoy quiet elegance, beautiful surroundings and attentive service, this is the place. The restoration was a non issue - we didn't hear any banging or noise associated with it at all. It was all being done very discreetly. And the renovated guest rooms were updated in a very modern, but still Halekulani way. Very beautiful. And on our final day, two hotel executives came to our room to ask us if everything ahd been to our satisfaction and if the renovation had been an issue.

The highlight of our trip was the amazing time we spent at the Halekulani hotel.  We travel regularly to Hawaii, this was our first trip to the Halekulani as guests.  From the moment we checked in, until the moment we departed, we were treated as valued guests.  Every detail is addressed and executed flawlessly.  The check in process is handled in your room, and in a discreet and professional manner.  Each member of the staff is carefully trained and their concern for your happiness is thought of in the questions they ask, and the follow up you receive.  The room we had was a beautiful oceanfront room.  The furnishings were gorgeous, and the decor was updated and lovely.  Our lanai had 2 chairs, with a full size chaise lounge.  The room was everything you would expect from a 5 star property, and we much preferred the room to other 5 stars we have visited previously.  Dining was always excellent, we missed Le Mer on this trip as it was being remodeled, however, House without a Key and the Verandah for afternoon tea were both excellent.  The location of our room was so well situated that we could listen to and watch the nightly show from our lanai.  The hula and music are definitely worth watching and sipping a nice cold Mai Tai only makes the experience more enjoyable.   Each time we needed to get our car from valet, we were greeted by warm and friendly service, always asking if we needed a map, water, or a recommendation.  You cannot beat the prime location, and if you want to shop you are close by to many shops and restaurants.

The Halekulani is a little bit of heaven in the midst of busy and touristy Waikiki.  It was fun to explore the shops and restaurants around the hotel, and then return to our oasis.  The pool area is beautiful and never crowded, but there is really not much of a beach. They are finishing renovations on the property and, for that reason, we requested a room as far away from the construction as possible.

We were told the other side was being refurbished and we were in the 'old side'. It was probably the most outdated room I have ever stayed in. Very strange that by opening up the wardrobe you can gain access to the bathroom, and there is no lock on the bathroom door (which has holes in it so sound 'leaks' into the bathroom). As someone who likes bathroom privacy this was awkward as I was traveling with a friend. The room was clean with sheets changed daily. If the hotel is just used as a base for exploring that is fine but, until the refurb, I wouldn't consider a romantic holiday at the hotel.

The pool area was very nice, there is a small beach in front of the hotel (which is public property). My companion, who smokes, found there is only one very miniscule smoking area and no where to smoke around the pool (which I was glad of, but smokers might want to consider this). The main areas of the hotel was nice.

My friend, who had visited Halekulani 5 times before, was most looking forward to the breakfast at House Without a Key but it was closed during our stay as they were doing something to the roof. They had combined the buffet and a la carte into one restaurant and it was very nice; good menu and I enjoyed the buffet which had a combination of continental, the usual buffet and Japanese food as the guests were mostly Japanese. Service was very good and I enjoyed my breakfast every day.

I think the main bonus about Halekulani is it's location. It's in a prime position for going out and exploring Honolulu. Having visited some truly beautiful hotels, I find it disappointing that this is the second best on Tripadvisor in Honolulu as if I ever return to Hawaii I'd hope to find something a little more luxurious; maybe I'll try Trump Towers!","Date of stay: January 2012","Trip type: Traveled with friends","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

We were told by our driver that Halekulani means ""House Befitting Heaven""... and the hotel lived up to its name.  The staff if very friendly and attentive.  As soon as we arrived, we were whisked up to our room for an in-room check in (no waiting in line or long check in process before finally getting to your room).  Since it was our honeymoon the management  left a large fruit plate with a bottle of champagne and a hand written note welcoming us, in the room.  A very nice touch.  

The room had a beautiful view of the ocean with a nice sized balcony.  The Bathroom was huge, with a sink, vanity, and separate soaking tub and shower.  All of the amenities and linens (bed, bath, robes) were plush.  The room had a refrigerator that was stocked twice daily with complimentary water.  The rooms were cleaned not once, but twice a day.  In the early part of the day housekeeping would come and do a full cleaning of the room, in the early evening while we were out to dinner they would come back and turn down the sheets, straighten up the room if it needed, and change any wet towels we had.  Each night we would come back to find a new little gift on our bed (a sea shell with a poem, truffles another night with a ""house"" recipe, a cute key chain with hand carved mini flip-flops).  The breakfast buffet had something for everyone: standard ""American Breakfast"" options like pancakes, eggs, baked pastries, coffee & tea; Japanese options like seaweed salad, miso soup, & sashimi, and local Hawaiian fruits and recipes.   Plus, every morning they would also set up a coffee station in the lobby so that you could grab a coffee to go.  The service during breakfast was top notch.  Our waiter made sure to go above and beyond to make sure we were happy. 

The hotel is centrally located in Waikiki walking distance to a number of restaurants, shops, and other hotels. It rained one day while we were there and the hotel staff put out bins with umbrellas throughout the hotel for the guests to take and use. The beach directly in front of the hotel is small, but you can easily walk down the beach to a bigger area a few feet away.  The pool was very nice...and again, we got great service by the pool.  

The spa offered a great selection of services and their staff was attentive and very professional.  Whenever we vacation, the spa is a must for us, and the Halekulani's did not disappoint.  

The business center was great as well.  Large, with a number of computers so you don't have to wait, and an attendant on hand in case you require any assistance.  It also had its own bar containing coffee, tea, juice, water, and soda, and couches and televisions where you could sit and read a book.  

There may be bigger or more modern hotels in the area, but I would find it hard to believe that there is any place with better attention to detail and service than the Halekulani.

We did not go wrong in anyway. The hotel is located in the heart of Waikiki - great for shopping and dining with easy access to all Waikiki has to offer yet quiet and elegant once inside the hotels grounds.  The service is outstanding from reception to concierge, restaurant staff, maid service etc - nothing was too much trouble and always with a smile.  We stayed in the rooms that are yet to be refurbished but they are extremely well maintained and well appointed.  The stand alone shower was the strongest we had on our trip.   The convenience of outer connecting rooms (rather than interconnecting) is great for families and the view overlooking the Ocean and Diamond Head was worth the splurge.   Breakfast was included in our package rate and we ate daily at House Without a Key overlooking the ocean - a beautiful setting and a great buffet breakfast. The beach area in front of the hotel is very small - there isnt enough room to sit on the sand but the hotel's pool overlooking the ocean is lovely and one of the largest in Waikiki.
We can't wait to return to this hotel - heaven in Honolulu.","Date of stay: January 2012","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The staff are exceptional, they are what really make this hotel stand out from the rest. Every single staff member who greeted us the night we checked in welcomed us ""home"".  

We visited Halekulani for the first time in July/August 2011 for a 10 night stay, and we were so blown away, we decided to return for our fortnight holiday in January.  

The hotel is undergoing a renovation project at the moment, so there were a few teams of builders on-site, but they were so discrete that you did not notice them.  The rooms have been very tastefully re-fitted with updated furniture and outdoor furniture that at first glance you do not notice the changes.

The huge wide screen tv is excellent.

The wardrobe can be accessed from both the room and the bathroom, so you are able to have both doors open and have a lovely sea view from the bathroom!  The in-house toiletries are nothing fancy but worked a treat.  

We received a hand written note from Gerald Glennon the General Manager welcoming us back, that was tucked into a lovely floral arrangement in our room upon our arrival, alongside 2 papaya halves, with fresh lime.  A cheese board and a bottle of their house red wine was also left for us.  The wine was delicious!

The nightly entertainment is enchanting, and the musical men even provide a sunset countdown for you, and take the time to point out the green flash.

We dined at all the hotel restaurants, and returned to Orchid's no less than 6 times for their Onaga ""Orchid's Style"" dish that has been on their menu for 20 years.

We will be counting the sleeps until we can return to Halekulani and count ourselves exceptionally lucky to be able to have this fabulous hotel as part of our life now.","Date of stay: January 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I hope to stay at one of their suites on day on an anniversary in the future.  Using whatahotel.com to book my stay was hugely beneficial as well as a tip.

Relaxing is not a word that you associate with Waikiki,  but  the moment you set foot in the open air lobby of this fine resort,  there is an immediate sense of peace and calm.   This won't necessarily be to everyone's liking.  The decor,  the floral arrangements,  the rooms are all understated.   

 The service is wonderful,  very quiet and discrete.  The rooms are very automated,  and you can just press a button by a console on the bed table to signal your needs.   The bathrooms are set up to double as dressing rooms and have separate shower stalls and baths.  The rooms are a good size for Waikiki, and the suites (I had a Pool view suite) are very luxurious.  

 Food is really superlative,  they have their own bakery on premises,  so breakfast is particularly good.   I've tried all of their restaurants except for La Mer,  and they are first rate.    In particular,  House Without a Key is a great place for an informal meal.    

While the hotel does not front a wide section of Waikiki beach,  the pool,  with its distinctive tiled Orchid bottom,  is heated  and usually not crowded.  

There are two particularly special Halekulani experiences that I would recommend.  One is to go the House Without a Key in the evening to see Kano'e Miller,  a former Miss Hawaii,  dance the Hula to the tunes of a live Hawaiian Band.   The classiest act that you will see in Hawaii.  The other is to order a Japanese breakfast and enjoy it on the terrace of your room.  The breakfast consists of grilled fish,  rice or rice porridge and pickled vegetables.   It's a great alternative to an American breakfast and no other Hawaii hotel (not even the Four Seasons) does as it well.","Date of stay: March 2011","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

However it did not live up to our expectations. Whilst the hotel is well maintained, I did not find the service to be outstanding. The check-in receptionist seemed distant and cold and despite requesting a high room floor prior to arrival, we were given a 2nd floor room. The room decor is outdated as is the bathroom. I did like the layout of the wardrobe as a walk-through to the bathroom. 

The restaurants were nice but not any different from the other 5* hotels in Hawaii. Having stayed at the Royal Hawaiian just the week before, we much prefer the RH as the rooms and service were of a much higher standard. RH is also of much better value considering we paid $100 less per night.

Halekulani is a good hotel but having stayed at many luxury hotels in the world, this hotel is not one I am planning to return to and is by no means anywhere near my favourites.","Date of stay: January 2012","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

I told Santa this would be a great gift!  And he did not disappoint!   We could of gone to Maui for a few days, but we opted to return here and just be pampered.  The pool is fab.  Sure the beach is very small, but its an easy walk to the water.  Sunset dinner at Orchids is a must.  Food is decadent and amazing and Rob our waiter was excellent.  Him and Chris waited on us hand and foot and actually took the time to chat and enjoy conversation.  We were never rushed.   And the  Mai Tais at House W/O a key is also a must do.

We were given a tour of the grounds once our room was available and had fruit and chocolate waiting in our room. Every night we had a turn down service with a new little gift left on the bed with a light pickup of the room in the evening that was unexpected. 

We had a fun family room service which was very relaxing. We also tried the House without a Key and the Orchids Brunch. Both were worth a try. I especially loved the feel of the House without a Key in the open view of the sea and beautiful pool. Another thing to see are either white doves or pidgeons and many wedding ceremonies in the square garden area. We saw almost 4 a day the whole weekend. If you wish to visit the Spa there, book ahead! I could barely get in for a basic mani/pedi and it was at a bad time for me so I couldn't partake.

Our rooms had beautiful views of Diamond Head and the ocean. The room was clean and spotless, but the decor needs an update. Several commenters have mentioned they were in updated rooms and ours hopefully was not done yet because the furniture was very dated and bland colored. Our bed was also a bit lumpy and old feeling. The room did have a great sound docking speaker/radio for some entertainment.The bathroom however was nice as is minus a kind of short shower head for my tall husband. The shower head was amazing and probably the best I've experienced. After visiting the Ihilani's renovated rooms in Kalopei, the decor here was a bit of a downer and just too bland and beige. The attention to detail and service helped and I look forward to going back another time to see a more modern and updated room at the Halekulani.

He is a frequent Four Seasons and Ritz Carlton visitor so I had high expectations.  The Halekulani did not disappoint and I am a fairly harsh grader when it comes to hotels.  

The resort was immaculate and the service was awesome, 5 star for both.  Here are a few examples.  We stayed in an ocean front room on the third floor overlooking the pool and the ocean.  At night we could hear the waves crashing.  Awesome!  Upon arrival we were taken to our room by someone from the front desk and introduced to the resort and our room.  In the room we found some complimentary fresh fruit greeting us.  The beds were comfortable, two queens since there were three of us, and the rooms looked like they had either been recently renovated or the best kept I had seen, they looked brand new.  The bathroom was my wife's favorite of the trip if that helps any.

Valet parking and self parking were the same price so we used the valet service.  They were always timely, friendly and very convenient.  The resorts pool was heated, a nice touch since we went in December.  Although the temperature outside was still in the 70's a warm pool was still a welcome addition.  The resort does have a beach but it is small.  It's not an issue though as it never felt crowded.  Plus you can easily walk to the famous Waikiki beach.  Restaurants and shops are abundant and within easy walking distance of the resort.  You feel in the center of everything but not crowded given the design of the resort ad its location at the end of the Waikiki beach strip.

Here is another example of the fine service at this resort.  We returned to our room one day to find the maid service cleaning it.  The maids greeted us by name (incredible that they knew that).  We walked in and the maid asked us in the nicest way to please scan our card for their safety and ours.  They were sweet and it was a nice touch and well handled.  Also, each night when they did the complimentary turn down they brought us a small gift each night.  We found ourselves looking forward to receiving it.  The one evening when we had the do not disturb sign out they brought the gift up the next morning - again service oriented.

My last note on service, we had reserved two rooms but unfortunately my son who was due to travel with us developed a kidney stone the day we were to leave and was delayed coming to Hawaii.  He didn't make the Oahu portion of the trip.  Upon arrival I explained it to the desk at the Halekulani and their response was ""we are very sorry to hear about that, we will take care of the reservation"".  They didn't charge me even though it passed the cancellation date.  Again 5 star service.  Read my review on the Fairmont Orchid on the Big Island, they didn't handle it this well.  Kudo's to the Halekulani.

The only ding I would give them is that they have the heating and air tied to a motion detector like many resorts.  At night when we were asleep the room would get warm and wake us up occasionally.  Also, there was no way to turn the fan on and have it stay on, again another energy conversation mechanism.  We called down to the desk and they sent up a maintenance person who explained how it worked and offered to bring up someone to override the controls (again great service).  We opted not to do that as it wasn't that bad at night and we left the porch door open (it was also tied the air conditioning which wouldn't run with that door open, reasonable).  The one thing I would recommend is that they change the HVAC system to allow you to run the fan constantly.  Many people, including us, like to have the background noise at night to deaden other sounds in the hotel.  That being said, even at peak season, this resort was peaceful at night.

All in all a fantastic resort, we would absolutely stay there again.  To compare and contrast, read my reviews of the Fairmont Orchid on the Big Island and the Hyatt on Maui.","Date of stay: December 2011","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Walking back to the room with two cups of coffee requires a balancing act when the elevator is keyed.  The front desk woman ran across the lobby when she saw me and used her key to get the elevator to let me up to our room.  She did it with a large smile on her face at 5:30 AM.  It was a great example of how the hotel staff went out of their way to take care of us.  We have champagne on the hotel with fresh fruit upon arrival.  A small box of chocolates that my wife devoured.  The room was always cleaned at the exact right time so we never had the knock we were in the room.  The lobby bar is fabulous although missing my favorite drink (liked the entertainment).

The room is not large but the bathroom is pleasantly spacious.  Shower has the best output of about any.  Our room had a nice couch and desk to work from and since I was actually working in Hawaii, this was greatly appreciated.  Room with a partial ocean view is really partial.  Balcony was nice to sit out on but beware that there is a peepers paradise of rooms facing each other.  I would assure the blinds are drawn most of the time since everyone sits out.  Great location at the western end of the beach area.  Reasonable amount of beach in front of the hotel but frankly if beach is the desire, Waikiki is not the best in the islands and is much deeper and easier to enjoy further to the east.

Then there is Noly Paa. I believe he is a permanent fixture at Lewers, and rightly so! He plays solo piano several nights a week, and he is awesome. Classically trained, he can play it all. Debussy to The Beatles, showtunes, love songs (contemporary to nostalgic), easy rock to 50's doowop. He interprets each with his own style panache, all solo. You will love his music like all in my party did. A must see and listen!

Last, there is Lewers itself. Lovely and dark; cool and relaxing with elegance and unsurpassed style. You will want to go again and again.

We only found out days before our arrival that major renovations were underway and were very apprehensive when we arrived.  Management could not have been more understanding and upgraded us to a Diamond Head ocean front room.  All credit to the hotel, the renovations were carried out very discreetly.  From the time we arrived in our room to the time we checked out, we couldn't have asked for more.  Service was outstanding, going out of their way to help.  Our room was extremely comfortable with wonderful views over Diamond Head and the ocean. We thought the small gift left each night added a special touch to our stay.  On the last night we ate at Orchids, food was superb and the view at sunset was out of this world.  Can't wait to return when the renovations are completed.

From the moment we checked in, we were shown to our room by a nice lady named Amy.  She finished the check in items in the comfort of our room, showed us how to operate all the items and was exceptionally friendly and thorough.  When she was about to leave, my husband went to give her a tip and she refused it, saying that this was part of her job and that a tip was not required.  That was the type of service that we experienced for the remainder of our trip.  It is so rare to feel that someone who works for a hotel felt that it was their duty and part of their job to give such excellent service and not expect anything in return.  The concierge was wonderful and helped us to book several dinner reservations as well as make recommendations.  They were very friendly and helpful.  
I think that the hotel is in the midst of trying to renovate and update many of their rooms and therefore there was quite a bit of noise during the day that can be heard from the pool area.  But they were well aware of this and provided guest with ear plugs if they wanted to block out some noise.  
Other little things that were nice were that every night at turn down service, they would leave a little card with a saying as well as a little gift.  I was excited to see what they would leave every night.  Besides that, if you were laying about the pool area at 2pm everyday, they would pass out Melona ice cream pops. We missed it everyday since we were out.  On the last day, we got back at 3pm and asked the pool attendants if they were finished handing out popsicles and he went inside to get us some eventhough they were done handing them out.  
The food at the restaurants were good but quite pricey, we ended up eating away from the hotel most days.
The business center was also a great place.  We had full access to internet, printers and telephones as well as some fresh fruits and soft drinks as well as coffee and tea.  
We were invited to a Managers Reception cocktail party on one of the evenings we were there.  They served cocktails and appetizers and the food and drinks were excellent.  
The Halekulani made our stay in Waikiki, one of the best experiences we've ever had.  Their attention to detail and to their customers was great.  I would definitely go back if i go back to Honolulu again.","Date of stay: October 2011","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

There were so many little touches, such as the small gifts, the way nothing was too much trouble and even the little note of best wishes left in the car by the porters when checking out, that made our stay so memorable.

We were extremely impressed with this hotel.  The rooms were simple while being elegant.  The Halekulani admittedly focuses on service, and it shows.  The night of our arrival we ate at House without a Key.  The next evening, when we went down to have cocktails and watch hula and listen to the entertainment, the waiter that had waiting on us the night before remembered us and come over to say hi.  He was not waiting on our table, however he came over to say hi and even remembered exactly what we had the night before. 

Every time we ran into a Halekulani staff member, they always greeted us by name and said hi.  We used the concerge desk three or four times.  Each time we made a reservation with them, they called back within a minute or two to confirm those reservations.  

Each time we called concierge or the front desk, they always answered ""Hello Mr and Mrs Maurer"". 

I have not received this kind of service at any other hotel that I have ever stayed at.

On top of it all, the view was spetacular.  We had a Diamon Head room that was right on the ocean.  We could not have asked for a better room.

Yes, they were renovating while we were there.  We did see them the workers out and about, however we did not hear them.  The were not working on our building, so it may have been a different story if we were staying in the building that they were working on.

The wedding (which was on a second floor reception area) was lovely and I would highly recommend the venue for those purposes.  However, we probably would have chosen to stay elsewhere if it had not been for the wedding, due to cost and the current condition of the property.  Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would probably consider staying here again after the renovations are completed, though I would also want to check out the Kahala and Westin resorts to see how they compare.

Pluses:
- Great service
- Beautiful, well-kept grounds and common areas
- Nice sized pool
- Walking distance to central Waikiki beach and shopping areas.  Not having to jump in a car/taxi every time we wanted to go out made travelling with an infant much easier
- Good food at restaurants, though not cheap!
- Early evening hula performance at the pool side bar
- Baby friendly - they provided a crib, baby toiletries and recommendations to a nanny service
- Free popsicles by pool and water bottles was a nice touch

Minuses:
- Rooms are showing their age and while clean and well kept, need upgrading.  This is currently in progress.  We were happy that ongoing renovations did not impact the quality of our stay in any way
- Expensive, though we were able to take advantage of a stay-3-nights-get-a-4th-night-free promotion, which made the costs more reasonable
- Beach area small, but didn't matter to us since our baby is too young for the beach anyways 
- Limited shaded areas by the pool","Date of stay: September 2011","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

We payed $550/night for a partial ocean-view room. This hotel is also on the T&L 500 list. So my expectations were fairly high.

I can see how this was once a very nice place. To be fair, there seems to be some construction going on, so maybe this will all be fixed. But compared to new resorts in this price range, the Halekulani pales in comparison.

The pool is fairly pretty from far away. However there was only about 10 umbrellas, and the remaining 400 chairs are spread out in the grass, and all sorts of random places very far away. The ""private"" beach is about 20 feet wide. 

But the real problem is the room. My first reaction was, ""is this a mistake?"" Like maybe I was at the wrong hotel. I've honestly stayed at Best Westerns that are far superior in room quality. The bathrooms look like they are from the 70's or 80's. Low ceilings. The balcony furniture looked like it came from Walmart. 

Anyway, I think I've made my point. If I were forced to stay on Waikiki again, I would probably try the Westin, or really anywhere else. The Kahala is beautiful and is just outside of Waikiki. 

On a positive note, the staff was very friendly and the manager did comp us a free lunch (minus alcohol), since our room wasn't clean when we arrived.","Date of stay: September 2011","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

This was our 2nd stay here, the 1st being 2 yrs ago. As before-hence our return trip-it was HEAVENLY!  The locale is perfect-on the beach in the heart of Waikiki.  This enables one to do it all.  Fabulous restaurants are w/ in walking distance.  Nobu-across the street at their sister hotel, is nothing short of 5 star.  Roy's, also across the street, fabulous as well.
The Conceirge staff was just fabulous!  Frank and Erena having been there for years, are more than eager to cater to one's every whim, secure a dinner reservation, or help plan a perfect excursion to the North Shore, or Pearl Harbor.  We had 2 connecting Ocean View rooms, with a stunning view od Diamond Head,  that were spacious, and impeccably clean. The Pool Service is prompt and courteous, and attentive. The Mai Tai's (which the Halekulani is FAMOUS for!) were just amazing as well.  We dined at Orchids every am for the Bfast buffet which was great.  You will NOT be disappointed at this 5 star resort.  We cannot wait to return!
The only tiny draw back is that the beach does narrow slightly, BUT, the expanse of beach to the right or left is tramendous.  We just LOVE it here.

It's now the hotel to stay every time we visit.  Why?  We love the atmosphere and the staff who have been around for a while always remember us!  The location is quite convenient for shopping and it appears that a lot of the staff have not changed.  I take that as an indicator of a good hotel!  The showers are the hand held types and the toilets are away from the bathtubs so no worries on getting the seats wet when showering.   Housekeeping do a great job keeping the rooms clean and done within a sufficient amount of time, i.e. not ever having to wait outside for hours!  When I accidentally left a silver ring in the bathroom, there was a kind note left on the table (with my ring) advising me to keep valuables in the safe!  Now, that's not something we get when travelling in the US.  Anything left unattended is ""gone"" or destroyed.  As for the food, the Halekulani is known for its breakfast and ABC Mart is right in fromt of the hotel for those who'd like to save money.  There is also free coffee served in the morning in front of the restaurant.  The packages often include breakfast (quite often offered at the same price without it).  We'll continue to stay at this hotel but for better quality, I hope they repaint from time to time as their trade mark is""white"" and to make up for their slightly outdated furniture.

Want to go back.","This was a beautiful hotel to visit for 8 nights with some girlfriends. It was mums only - no kids and no husbands. 2 friends stayed at the Parc across the road and it was half the price of the Halekulani, but their hotel had nothing to offer like ours!!.   

It is perfectly located to everything. Can't recall the name of the main street with all the shopping, but it had everything. Not far from Ala Moana. A half hr limo ride to the premium outlet shopping mall. This isn't a great outlet mall. I have only been to one other in Florida which was bigger and better. The waikele (sp?) had very limited food, but on leaving the outlet I did see another shopping centre across the road that looked like it may have had a better selection of food. How are we supposed to fuel our energy to shop? 

The dining in Orchids was lovely. I wish we'd dined at Orchids earlier rather than the last night.  We went back for breakfast. Breakfast at House without a Key was disappointing. But perhaps I had high expectations since everything else was wonderful.  Cocktails in Lewers Lounge were very grown up with the piano man playing his tunes, some I recognised some I didn't, but maybe I'm not his demographic being 38. 

We stayed in a twin Ocean View room in the main building on the 11th floor. The bathroom is very generous in size. Unfortunately our friends were not able to stay on the same floor but it did not end up being a problem. The balconies are also a good size to sit back and relax. We had 6 of us in our room for pre dinner drinks one night and it was lovely to have a casual chat with some wine and champagne and enjoy the view.  This is a special hotel. 

The pool is good. I loved that the pool people would find you some where to sit and set it up for you by putting a towel on the sun lounge and you get another towel to dry yourself with. Pool temperature was fine. They could do with more shade for some of the sun lounges exposed to direct sunlight. It was great to be able to walk a few steps and swim in the ocean. The water temperature was perfect and the water was clear. Not suitable for little ones. And the pool was not suitable for little ones either. But I don't think it's somewhere I'd take my little ones and be relaxed. A nice touch was when the ice creams get handed out poolside. 

The rooms have clock radios that are also docking stations for your ipod or iphone.

Chose Halekulani based on location, reviews, plus Amex Fine Hotels & Resorts program benefits.

We arrived at the hotel ~11:30 after our flight from Sydney. The entrance is beautiful. We were greeted straight away, bags taken care of and informed our room wasn't ready yet (which we expected). They gave us our keys, told us they would call when our room was ready, then went to their complementary guest waiting room where we stocked up on some water, then strolled through Waikiki for some shopping & lunch.

We got a call notifying us our room was ready (I was surprised they actually called us!) and came back. The really friendly host gave us a brief tour of the hotel facilities, and took us to our room. I don't think we got an upgrade with our Amex FHR benefits because the hotel was fully booked the dates we stayed, but the room was great anyway. Everything was elegant, bed was comfortable, and the view of Waikiki beach from our lanai was a great sight after all that traveling. Small touches like welcome gifts every day, and 

The hotel pool was great. All the staff we encountered were courteous and welcoming, and the hotel grounds impeccable. Had dinner at Orchids on our last night (Complimentary through Amex FHR again..) which was very nice. I honestly could not fault anything with our experience at Halekulani. Although slightly expensive, I would definitely stay here again if I'm back in Waikiki anytime soon!","Date of stay: June 2011","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

From the moment we arrived in the Halekulani we were treated like very special friends and we immediately established a warm connection with the extremely helpful staff. The peaceful, secluded gardens and open spaces invite relaxation. The rooms are decorated in an understated style and are very spacious. The food was always excellent and having tried a few other venues there is no doubt that the best quality dining for all meals was in the Halekulani. That said, we very much enjoyed Dukes in the Outrigger but, sorry to say guys, the Dukes in Kauai was way better. Hy's steakhouse was excellent also. Back to the Halekulani! We enjoyed the pool and the beach equally well and for a nightcap or drink before dinner the Lewers was excellent. All of the above is fairly standard stuff for reviews of this hotel. However, when hurricane Irene hit the East Coast and Continental Airlines effectively abandoned us we were looked after by the hotel in every way that you could have asked for including distressed rates for three rooms for one extra night. Of course it is expensive but the only money we wasted on the trip was the price of a revolting lunch in the Sheraton next door to the Halekulani. As Ace Ventura would say, ""Do not go in there!"". It is a long journey from Dublin to Hawaii but we cannot wait to get back there - and we will not be flying Continental. If it were not for an excellent United Airways administrator called Janice Kamura in Honolulu, we would still be wandering around North America.","Date of stay: August 2011","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Most of the other hotels we have stayed at on Waikiki Beach in the past have catered to the typical tourist, many who have been loud and rude in hotels. This is the perfect hotel for a wedding, honeymoon, or anniversary,  as it is quite romantic, with a relaxed atmosphere and private beach.
This hotel had a dress code,  a serene environment, excellent service, and guests  (many from Japan) who were so polite  and courteous.  We never wanted to leave our room which faced Diamondhead and the ocean. If you can afford it, get a room with a view.  Breakfast at either restaurant with an ocean view was included in our package.   Our  sunset evenings were spent on our balcony, enjoying a glass of champagne and listening to live music in the courtyard.  The spa treatments were fabulous.  Dinner at 'Orchids' is a must, even if you are not staying at the hotel.  The staff goes out of their way to make your stay a memorable experience.  The hotel is located a block from fabulous shopping and restaurants.

One of the first things we noticed in the hotel is that guests were predominantly Japanese tourists.  We liked that, it means that hotel service, quality and amenities meet the high standards of Japanese and therefore this hotel is of necessity high quality.

The excellent aspects of the hotel include:
- room quality
- cleanliness
- Concierge
- staff friendliness and helpfulness
- spa
- great wireless lan
- ""Japanese"" toilets, the ones with the cleansing sprays and dryer

Two things need clear improvement:
1) the photos about the beach are completely misleading.  The beach is is perhaps 20 meters wide, very crowded with families, and mostly eroded away.  Plus, disgustingly, there is quite a bit of litter which hotel did not clean (we even found broken glass fragment on the beach).  In other words, for ocean swimming walk the kilometer to public beaches.  Also the hotel pool is a boring oval. They should install an infinity pool.

2) The restaurant ""House without a Key"" has a very limited menu and is understaffed.  The servers are kind but do not have time to serve and attend.

Our room was Junior Ocean Suite and we highly recommend it. The room has two large balconies and we could see both ocean and Diamond Head.

A nice diversion during our stay was two weddings.  They bring a special ambiance to the hotel.

One final note to new tourists to Hawaii like me, if you see the word ""poke"" on the menu it means raw or uncooked fish.

The hotel did not receive 5 stars in my review because of the beach, and understaffing of the restaurant.  We would gladly return.","Date of stay: August 2011","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Having not stayed at any other hotel in Honolulu, I can't compare it to anything else but from what I've read and heard, it's one of the best and I believe it.  The atmosphere is quiet and upscale -- no rowdiness or big crowds.  The pool is small but well kept, and my kids (13, 10, 10) enjoyed it.  Breakfast at Orchids was much better than the buffet at House Without a Key.  The quality of the food at Orchids was far superior, and it was a nicer way to start the morning instead of lining up at the buffet and waiting (too long!) for the one chef to prepare omelettes.  The rooms were clean, but are in need of remodelling.  Concierge staff was helpful with advice, reservations, tracking down a camera left in a rental car, and arranging surfing lessons for our kids.  We had a late flight out on our last day, so put our luggage into storage with the porters and made use of the hospitality suite.

Location is great (or not great, depending on your perspective) - far enough from the Jersey Shoreness of the main strip but close enough to walk anywhere.  Quiet at night. We slept with the balcony door open and listened to the waves.  Large percentage of guests were Japanese (there's miso soup on the breakfast buffet). Room and bathroom were spacious and looked just like the pictures (cream colored faux bamboo furniture, like someone's grandmother's condo in Florida).  Pool area aesthetically unremarkable but fine and the attendants were helpful.  Guys at the bell desk also very helpful.  Gym on the small side but okay.  

It's a non-smoking hotel (even the balconies), but a few times our room smelled like smoke.  I complained twice.  The second time management was very responsive (though I think they were responsive because I said it smelled like marijuana smoke) -- and by responsive i mean they sent a guy to spray orange air freshener and another guy to clean our air vent,  then the night manager patrolled the hallway.  (By way of comparison, I recently complained that my room at the Mandarin Oriental in HK smelled like smoke.  They moved me to a new room and sent a box of chocolate truffles and a note of apology.)

My friend and I stayed there for a girl’s weekend in July.  From the minute we arrived at the hotel the service was amazing.  Our room wasn't ready (we arrived in the morning at 10:30am) so we were taken (not directed - someone walked us there) to the Hospitality Room where we could change our clothes and leave our luggage.  They then took our cell number and called us as soon as the room was ready.  The spa was very private - with your own changing room and sauna or tub.  My friend's massage therapist saw her as we were leaving 2 days later and called out to her by name to have a good trip!  Very personalized service and great treatments.  The location of the hotel was excellent, right by all the hustle and bustle of Waikiki shopping and right on the beach.  The pool area was serene; the people that work at the pool get your towels and set you up each day.  The chair covers were wonderfully soft.  We went into some of the other big name hotels nearby (like the Royal Hawaiian) and people looked crammed in like sardines - not at the Halekulani.  Another example of the amazing service - I handed over postcards and bought stamps - the concierge noticed after I'd left that I hadn't addressed the postcards (just too relaxed!).  She only knew my first name (how I'd signed the cards) so she searched the hotel guest list for guests with my name and called.  How many hotels would do that?  Oh, and be sure to have lunch at the Room Without A Key - sublime!  The room was comfortable and wonderfully calming.  We never heard another guest even though we knew the hotel was almost full.    The bathrooms were huge.   I could go on and on, it’s worth every penny!

The staff does go out of their way for you and that is what sets the hotel apart from the rest in Waikiki.

We ate at all 3 restaurants within the hotel and they were all great. Especially La Mer the fine dining French restaurant. The food was amaaazing, the service was polished, not too fussy. The view was magical. Orchid did the best a la carte breakfast- order the banana and macadamia nut pancakes....YUM!!!
The best thing about this hotel is the location. It is literally on the sand on Waikiki beach. It is at the nice end of Waikiki as well. The pool was amazing. Big enough so you weren't swimming on top of other people. The hardest decision we had to make the whole time was whether we swim in the pool or the ocean! Lots of restaurants near by and close to the DFS Galleria which is where the trolleys depart from.
There is a surf school directly across the road called Ty Gurney's surf school. We ended up surfing with them almost every day, and we could even charge it to our room which was super convenient! The instructors there were super friendly, I would recommend them highly!

We travelled to the Halekulani for 8 days with a party of 12 for a family trip. We had small children and teens. Some reviewers claim that this is not a family hotel but I think it worked great for us. The understated service is perfect. I have had the chance to visit some five-star properties in my life and not easily impressed -- but this really is the only place to be in Honolulu. We especially loved the low-key quiet environment and beauty of the hotel. The rooms are very comfortable  and large (loved the beds, pillows and large bathroom) and they were cleaned spotless several times a day with fresh towels and ice. From the concierge to the valets, everyone treated us so nicely and you wait for nothing. People complain about the small beach, but it's perfect for little kids. The pool area was never crowded and it was always  quiet, and easy to get a row of lounge chairs -- with plenty of dry towels, ice water and free magazines. It was the ultimate place to relax, watch the sun go down,  and go from the pool to the bar for some music. The pool service menu is reasonable and the drinks were very good... and the breakfast buffet is worth the splurge every now and then. You can get a reasonable breakfast at Orchids for half the price and the same amazing views if you don't want to stuff yourself at the buffet. The views, nightly music at the House Without a Key, and overall vibe were a very nice change from the busy streets of Waikiki and American chain hotels-- yet you can walk out the door and for a change of pace, or find everything you might want to bring back to your room at the ABC stores that are everywhere. I loved all the Japanese weddings and just hanging out on the property... mornings on the lanai with papaya and coffee taking in the surf and rainbows. I'll be going back for sure. It's a truly wonderful place and I was very sad to leave it. Don't over think the dress code - just use common sense.

The service is attentive and , most of all, the property itself makes you feel like you're part of an exclusive club. It is ""tucked"" away at the end of some of the busier streets in DT Honolulu but as soon as you step on the property, you feel like you're in another world. 

We were there during my birthday and management sent up flowers and big delicious chocolate dipped strawberries. We booked two ""adjoining"" Junior Ocean suites. Each suite was not too big at 720 ft. but it was very cleverly laid out. The doors from the hallway open into a small standing area where you can access the two separate rooms. When you're inside this area, you can choose to lock the doors to the hallway and keep the doors to each of your suite open - creating a quick and easy access to the other suite. The bathroom is also very clean and fresh. It features a separate toilet area, a shower and a tub and your usual private label toiletries which are offered and refilled abundantly. 

The pool area seemed to be the place where you can get some insight to the profile of the guests. We stayed at the hotel for one week and used the pool everyday but didn't see much young children or children in general. Everyone seemed to be couples, young adults or older relaxed retirees. (hence, no kiddies pool too)

We ordered room service and also dined at its beachside resto - House Without a Key. I would highly recommend going there for breakfast or brunch. You can get a hearty breakfast (around $25+) and enjoy listening to the sound of the ocean and feeling the morning breeze pass through your hair. 

There are quite a few places to grab a quick bite to eat around the hotel but you will need to walk back out to the main road. Theres a lot of your typical chain resto food there and some Japanese ones inside the mall on the main road. No fast foods or cheap eats, most casual dinners will probably run you $35+

I also received the hotel's massage/exfoliation/steam spa package as a birthday gift. I don't want to comment on the skill of the provider since its quite subjective to each person but I can say for certain that if you go, know that you will enjoy the wonderful relaxing area where your massage will be. I enjoyed the steam sauna room which I individually.  Afterwards, they serve you tea and mochi icecream in the outdoor waiting area to end your visit. 

Lastly, Don't miss the ocean facing rooms! You will regret it once you get there and see how beautiful the sun rises and sets each day against the horizons. There's musical presentations by the pool side so you'd want to be able to enjoy that from the comfort of your room. 

Lots more to say, i think the attention to details is whats most memorable about this hotel. Even when I bring out the small Hale Kulani logo blazened momentos today, I have a Pavlovian reaction of feeling relaxed and happy :)

Access to quick cheap eats: 3/5","Date of stay: July 2010","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I spent some time getting some views on the forum as to where to stay for real 5*- and was not disapointed with my final choice - i booked just three days before we left and got a great deal on a sea view room. 
The room, food, service were al excellent - and an early check-in made it perfect. The concierge assistance with what to see, where to go and booking us on some excursions was also brilliant. I also used the Spa and this was also excellent.
My one and only criticism is not related to the hotel - just waikiki itself - it's basically Miami South Beach in Hawaii! and we could have gotten there on a 7 hour not a 22 hour flight! Maui for me was 'real' Hawaii - and if you only go to waikiki in Hawaii your definitely missing out!

I will change my travel dates if a room is not available at the time I want it.  Yes, the Halekulani is that good.  

There are other great hotels in Hawaii--amongst my favorites both the Lodge at Koele and the Manele Bay on Lanai, the Princeville Resort on Kauai and the Four Seasons at Wailea on Maui.  But my favorite island is Oahu.  It is by far the most interesting island in the chain, and as beautiful as any other, and that opens up my hotel choices quite a bit.  I suppose I could stay at the Ko Olina Resort out in Kapolei, but as nice as that is, it is way out there in the boonies, surrounded by nature and nothing else.  You might as well be on another island.  Then there's the Kahala Hotel and Resort, very nicely redone and removed from Waikiki, which some people may prefer.  Step outside the hotel grounds however, and you are in a residential area facing a private country club.  Very pretty, but with no car, you are limited to what you might want to do on foot.  

The fact is that if you are going to stay in Honolulu, you should stay in Waikiki.  I know--hugely commercial, noisy, crowded.  I've heard it all.  But Waikiki is no more commercial than Lahaina, where every other shop either sells tee-shirts or those ubiquitous  paintings of whales.  As for noisy and crowded, this is where the Halekulani resolves that issue.  More than its luxury next door neighbor, the Royal Hawaiian, the Halekulani is truly an oasis of calm and beauty.  Separated from the main streets of Waikiki and positioned right on the beach, you will feel a difference as soon as you walk into its lobby and moreso as you walk around the serene grounds.  Even the pool area seems quiet and relaxing relative to its more raucous neighboring swimming holes.  So you actually can stay in Waikiki, without feeling that you are in Waikiki, and yet having all the restaurants, entertainment, shopping and local color that Waikiki has to offer.  Remember that Waikiki is where the first king of Hawaii, King Kamehameha, chose to make his home, out of anywhere he could have chosen in the islands.  Take it from the expert.

Once in the hotel, you'll wonder why you even had any concerns about staying here.  If you can score a room with a view of Diamond Head and the ocean beyond, you will be in one of very few rooms in Waikiki that offer both.  Hungry?  The Halekulani has three outstanding restaurants, amongst the best in the city, suitable for every occasion and every level of dress.  If you can make it, you should definitely not miss Sunday Brunch at Orchids.  Room service is outstanding as well, especially if taken out on your balcony.  Everyone at the hotel are uniformly and consistently friendly and helpful.  Everyone talks about service at the Halekulani, for good reason.  You will not find better service anywhere--and I mean anywhere.  I stayed at the Gritti Palace in Venice a couple of years ago, and while I loved the experience and the hotel's amazing position on the Grand Canal, the service there paled in comparison to what I always witness at the Halekulani.

So enough about Wakiki being for the tourist crowd.  Rarely will tourists get treated as well as they will at the Halekulani.  This is my choice--my only choice--and the day I can't afford the experience anymore, that is when I stop going to Honolulu.","Date of stay: December 2010","Trip type: Traveled solo","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We had had a few days in Kauai and our girls 12 and 20 joined us a few days after we arrived at the Halekulani.
We loved every minute!
On our arrival they were unsure if our room was ready the hotel manager checked himself and we were taken up promptly and made to feel very welcome.
We had dinner at Orchards and the food was lovely.
The Sunday brunch was lovely too and service excellent.
We loved the cocktails every evening listening to the beautiful band at House With No Key.
The Concierge staff esp Wendy and Erena went out of their way to help us with our day trips around the island and all our other questions- nothing was too much trouble.
We all loved the pool area and service esp the girls (Kyle really looked after us).The beach maybe small but it was fine we went swimming and snorkelling and even saw a turtle swimming by us!
We stayed in Ocean front rooms and they where lovely. We had no trouble at all with our wireless internet and our room service excellent.
We often ate breakfast at Dennys over the road which our girls loved.
Our favourite dinner spot was Roys over the road as well the food is delicious!
Halekulani also had a deal with the restaurant Nobu again over the road and the food was excellent.
When we left for our day trips the bell staff always checked whether we wanted towels and bottles of water which was a nice touch. 
So as you can see from my review we would highly recommend a stay at the Halekulani it is an oasis if you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki but right in the middle of it if you want to jump back in.

The beginning was rocky with the front desk clerk ignoring me after 11 hours of flight from New York and attending to someone who cut the line in front of me. 
2. Without informing me, the hotel placed charge amounting to about 3-night -stay amount on my credit card, calling it a ""hold"". 
3. My friend has the worst allergy attacks while in the room, the allergy is relieved righr away, as soon as he leaved the room.
4. The roms do not even have a coffee-makers or anything to boil water. In order to get a cup of tea from whatever selection THEY have, one needs to pay room services charges. The hotel management seemed to be genuinely surprised to find out that every other hotel in Waikiki offers a coffee-maker for free. They eventually found a hot water electrical pot-dispenser for delivery of which they charged $15.00.
5. Overall, I find the hotel pretentious, overbearing, over-rated and not really attentive to guests and details of their stay. It seems they are primarily pre-occupied with trying to squeeze every penny they can out of the guest...

The facilities were good and the location is great. You don't go to Halekulani for the beach...it has a small section of Waikiki frontage, but it's location is ideal for access to the most exciting parts of the city. Someone got it spot on when they said that Waikiki is ""a place of sanctuary amongst the madness of Honolulu""...it is most certainly that!

Here are our comments step by step:

When we arrived to check in  we waited in line to check in . Nobody greated us.  After the receptionist finished with the previous customer she  did not raise her face and kept us waiting while typing on her computer for 5 more minutes. Did not acknowledge us.  Finally she checks us in  politely .  Then she asks us to wait in the reception area to be escorted to the room.  We sat down. Then the same receptionist waves at us from a distance ( did not bother to walk to us ) asking us to come over and accompany her ..... She brings us to the room. The first impression of the room is a smell of mildiou which persisted during the whole stay . The room was outdated ..... from the 70's: everything from the same time, furniture , bathroom .... The bed cover and sheets were all wrinkled, like they had gone thru a machine.... The air conditioning was loud, we shut it doanw and opened the window.... there are no curtains in the rooms but venitian blinds which let the light in in the mornings .

The staff at the restaurants, the spa and the pool were very friendly and respectful. We liked them and the convenience of being in the heart of waikiki and be in a  very tranquille environment at the same time . The beach is small but it is  very easy to go for a dip and come back  and lay down by the pool.  We got massages at the SPA and I fell asleep , it was really good !

Generally speaking the staff says hello when they come across you on the premises, which is nice .

Yes it has an incredible location, but then so do a few other hotels in this area which would not rate a mention.  I have been here on many occasions and there has not been one stay at this hotel that has been less than perfect.  The rooms are beautiful, restful, and impeccably clean.  It really feels as if you are their first guest.  Every person I have encountered, from room attendants to pool attendants, recption staff and concierge, they are all outstanding.  If I had a hotel and was looking for staff I would want them all Halekulani trained.    But it goes so much beyond that, the gardens which are so beautifully cared for, the breakfast that has no equal, their sunday brunch that is perhaps the best ever.  Make sure if you stay here, that your stay includes a Sunday  and their piece de resistance which is there year upon year the Halekulani Coconut Cake which is truly addictive.  I could go on and on because this Hotel has it all.","Date of stay: March 2011","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

From the moment we arrived we were treated as honoured guests by everyone there.
When you are taken to your room you are asked if you would like the restaurants and facilities pointing out to you which is very helpful as the hotel is big.
The manager has a champagne reception to meet the guests which I have never known in a hotel before which just adds even more to its charm.
We tried all of the restaurants and were very impressed by them all, nothing was too much trouble for the staff in any of them, and the food was excellent. Try the Verandah for afternoon tea( very english), its lovely after a hard day on the excellent sunloungers by the pool.
The only down side to our stay was the Tsunami alert after the Japanese earthquake. This was handled brilliantly by the manager and staff who kept us up to date and informed all through the night.

But, first, let me state very clearly for those of you traveling with children under the age of 16: LEAVE THEM HOME OR STAY ELSEWHERE! There is nothing here for kids to do, other than annoy those of us who stay here because it is peaceful and not kid-friendly. If you have kids, please consider the Hilton Hawaiian Village, just down the beach.

This hotel is wonderful for couples. The two restaurants, House Without a Key and Orchids, are lovely, romantic and have wonderful food and service. The staff in every department are first rate and first class. 

The rooms, mainly the bathroom, need minor updates, which we were told are planned. The rooms are extremely comfortable,views from oceanview and oceanfront views are spectacular. If you plan to roam, do speak with their wonderful concierge staff. They are all very knowledgeable, helpful and just topnotch.

Oh, and don't go down early, put your stuff on the pool chaise lounges, leave for 4 hours and then maybe come back. The chaises are first come, first serve, and while the pool staff tries to enforce this, hotel guests often have hissy fits when their stuff is removed. The pool policy is cleary stated on the information you are given at check in. Read it and be considerate of your fellow guests.  

The Halekulani is the ONLY hotel at which we will stay on Oahu, and we plan to visit again in May of this year. If you truly prefer, and can afford, a true 5 star hotel, then please consider staying at the Halekulani.

Since I wanted to be on Waikiki, I chose the Halekulani.  I was disappointed on arrival
in that the facility is very old and outdated, but clean and in good repair.  The front desk
staff was very kind and let me look at 3 rooms before deciding on our room.  The rooms
and bathrooms are very small and very plainly furnished.  The pool is small, lounges
are padded and comfortable.  There is no jacuzzi anywhere at the hotel.  The pool
deck is enclosed with a wrought iron fence with hedges so when you lay down you can't
see the ocean. :(  Food was excellent. I highly recommend the hamburger and the 
passion fruit daiquiris served at the poolside restaurant.  Breakfast buffet was $30 but quality was excellent. There is a Denny's right across the street as an option.  Location is great.  We walked down the beach to visit the other hotels and decided next time we will try the RoyalHawaiian or the Moana Surfrider.  They were both more beautiful and seemed to be livelier.  About half of the patrons at the Halekulani were Japanese which appeared to be a higher percentage than the other Waikiki hotels we saw which may contribute to the sedate atmosphere.","Date of stay: March 2011","Trip type: Traveled on business","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

It's also a great location, albeit the beach in front is quite narrow and the pool area is relatively small compared to large resorts on Maui and other islands.

The room we had was on a corner on the tenth floor with a full ocean view.  It was a very comfortable room and the furnishings were nice - the bed was a little on the soft side for me.
This hotel is quite old having been originally build around 1910.  Of course it has been added to and updated to modern standards.  However, the bathroom was quite small with only one sink and a very small shower stall.  It was fully stocked with every appropriate item for a hotel of this caliber.  

For the price I would prefer a Hyatt resort or the Four Seasons on Maui.  Waikiki is also part of a very large city and is very busy on the street level.  Not my idea of Hawaii, but if I needed to stay in the Waikiki area the Halekulani is certainly one of the hotels I would consider.","Date of stay: March 2011","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We stayed at Halekulani one night and checked out the next morning and headed west of the Island to Marriott Ihilani instead.  The best move for us.

As for Halekulani, lovely hotel but we were disappointed by a few things.  It was our anniversary and they gave us one of the loveliest rooms with the best view.  The room was nice.  However, there was so much that didn't fit what we expected.  The concierge service was really busy.  It was impossible to get through on the phone and there was a long wait to speak with someone at the counter.  Food at the Key was mediocre.  The U-shaped property allowed for almost no sunlight on their pool area.  Also, the ""beach"" was very, very tiney.  About 1000sf of sand area carved out on one side of the property, barely enough room to stand among the 20 people that were sunbathing and kids playing there.  To get to any real beach area, you had to walk quite a bit.

We realized Halekulani and Honolulu were too busy for the mood we were in, so we checked out and moved to Marriott Ilihani for the remaining 3 nights, and loved it... quiet, amazing beachfront, excellent food.","Date of stay: August 2010","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Everything about it was almost perfect (though perfection does come at a very high price). Superb staff, spacious, comfortable rooms, wonderful sea-front location, excellent food, drinks so generous that a single mai tai laid me out for the evening. The only drawback (mentioned in another review) is the street noise in the garden view/partial ocean view rooms, which does start very early in the morning. The Halekulani is a favourite with young Japanese honeymooners and an almost non-stop procession of wedding groups, with the brides in amazing dresses, was passing through the hotel when we stayed. Waikiki, on the other hand, is a temple to commerce and not much else. It's high-rise apartment blocks and huge hotels interspersed with shopping streets and malls as far as the eye can see, a mixture of tourist tat and international high-end fashion brands that you can get anywhere.

The location is the best. on the beach, yet quite, near the center of Waikiki.
The service is like in all 5* hotel, excellant !
The hotel is quite, not a ""train station"" like all other hotels in Wakiki. I love the decore simple yet very elegant and expensive.The rooms are large all with a balcony.
The pool is not big yet very elegant with great service. Because the hotel is not a family oriented hotel, there were very few children, and they were very quite. The pool is quite no problem having a chair with an umbrella any time of the day and very few people in the pool.The pool is on the beach, so any time you can go out walk on the beach or go into the sea. We walked every day two times along Waikiki beach, enjoyed the sun set from the hotel garden cafe. In the afternoon/sun set they play music in the garden resturant, come early 5:30 to secure a place to sit and enjoy the the music and the beautiful sun set. You can also sit in the pool and enjoy the sun set. 
We saw all the big hotels on Waikiki beach, and were so happy we stayed at the Halekulani. All the other hotels are so big with tones of people coming and going, noise, the pools are full, with shops and a feel of a train station. 
The resturant at the hotel ""the house with out a key"" is great not too expensive, good food,  and great veiw of the sun set. 
We booked a graden view room and got  room # 730 on the 7th floor . The room is facing the garden but also facing the main street. For 2 night I could not sleep beacuse of the street nosie. We complained to the hotel and with no problem, we were up graderd to Ocean/pool view which was great, at night I could hear the ocean, and sitting on the balcony looking at the pool and the oacean is a real treat. 
If you book a graden veiw room make sure your room is away from the street.
If you don't have small kids, looking for  a more of a mature hotel guests, looking for a real classy vacation without noise, on the beach but yet few steps away from the shopping streets, hotel with great service, nice rooms, quite pool, with out many shops in the hotel lobby and a great sun sets view - THE HALEKULANI is your place. 
I wish I could go back .....NOW !.
Make sure is you want to eat in a good resturant in Waikiki to make reservations 2-3 ahead. All the good resturants are fully booked for dinner.

'Wish we could have stayed even longer.

Everything about this hotel is a refined class act.  From the greeting at the front door, to the check-in, to the pool staff, to the restaurants, to the housekeeping, to the concierges and business office people, the staff and service are friendly, polished, and professional.

We checked into room #651 -- the lowest price that they offer, but quite nice.  While the room does not have an ocean view, its terrace does -- a glorious place for morning coffee.  The room is spacious, with a king bed, sofa and chair, desk, and most of the amenities you expect of a hotel at this level (see below for some minor exceptions.)  The terry robes are plush, but you may prefer the lighter weight waffle robes I saw in the gift shop if (like us) you like to leave the balcony door open on a warm, breezy morning.  

Very comfy bed, but it comes with a too-warm duvet.  We mostly used the top sheet, but a light weight blanket is preferred.

Lots of drawer space.  The large closet opens to both the bedroom and the bathroom.  There is an empty fridge so that you can put YOUR items in, or ask them to stock with your favorites.

The bathroom is spacious, with one sink in this room (maybe upgraded rooms have double sinks.)  Lots of towels, changed with the twice daily maid service.  Separate tub and shower, and the toilet in a little closet.  (I LOVE hotels that cater to Japanese, in part for the deep bathrubs that usually come with the rooms.)  Lots of nice toiletries, including mouthwash and sewing kits.  Combined with the clothing and jewelry options in a hotel shops, you could be shipwrecked here and still look good.

Many nice touches: fruit and chocolates arrived at check-in.  The turn-down service left nice souvenir items, e.g. a carved wood magnet one night; a bookmark another.  An attendant in the pool area came around with complimentary honeydew frozed popsicles.  Excellent complimentary coffee in the House WIthout a Key area in the morning.

We were on the breakfast plan, which I strongly recommend if you enjoy a good breakfast in the morning.  The first morning, we had the American breakfast with table service at Orchids.  Not bad, but the real treat is the buffet breakfast at House Without a Key.  There was an excellent array of hot and cold items for western and Asian tastes.  Wonderful fruits and fresh juices, pastries, chafing dish items, etc. and etc.  They paid attention to detail: very good plain yogurt, not just the overly sweetened stuff that passes for yogurt in many American brands.  A master omlet maker at the helm.

Minor gripe: control the birds better.  I know this is a difficult task in an open-air environment, but I even saw a bird picking at the pastry table on the breakfast buffet.  Birds carry all sorts of diseases.  Thankfully, we never saw guests feeding them!

We had dinner one night at Orchids, and lunch at House Without a Key.  Excellent all aoround.   If we stayed longer, La Mer would be at the top of the list.  It runs on a prix fixe basis, starting at $95 for two courses plus dessert.  Because we had reservations at other places, we ran out of time for what looks like a wonderful menu.  However, we got a chance for cocktails in the La Mer bar -- pricey, but a civilized environment.  The cocktail hour music from the outside terrace can be heard when the weather cooperates.  I understand that there may be a special arrangement with nearby Nobu, but it was never mentioned to us -- I read about it from a Tripadvisor review after the fact.

Speaking of which: this is a great location for off-site restaurants, shopping, etc.  A quick cab ride will give you even more options, but I could easily amuse myself within walking distance.  Even across the street, you have Nobu, an outpost of Roy's -- and Denny's.

I love the pool and beach area here.  They monitor the check-in, and the water was a perfect temperature.  There is also a lawn area near the pool as well as concrete, where the chaises can be placed under plumeria trees for shade -- lovely!  The sandy, clean beach is a quick walk away.  The beach is public throughout Waikiki, and rather narrow at this end, but that helps to keep the crowds down.  However, it makes for a nice long walk along the shore if you like.

January can see storms, and we got a whopper one morning.  The staff did an excellent job coping, but it meant rolling down the blinds in the open-air areas, including the lovely dining rooms.

Good deal: the concierge can tell you how to get free admission to many Honolulu museums.  Given a rainy, windy day, we took advantage of this to the Academy of Art, the Bishop Museum, and the Iolani Palace.  Of all our previous visits to Honolulu, we never made it to those places, but they were very enjoyable, and a ""fix"" to bad weather.

There is a nice hospitality room for free internet access, coffee/tea and fruit at all hours.  You can use the room if you have a later flight as it includes showers, lockers, etc.

The manager's reception is also very nice.  The hotel attracts a variety of people from around the world, and it was a very socialble event with nice drinks and hors d'oeuvres.  To the two freindly, fabulous ladies from Australia -- 'lovely to meet you!  The onsite weddings of Japanese couples also made for festive times.  Given the good manners of the Japanese, the events were not intrusive.

My complaints are relatvely minor, and many will probably be addressed in the next renovation: 

  1.  The safe is much too small for modern life.  It might fit a Kindle and a wallet, but not much else, and definitely not a laptop or netbook.

  2.  The electrical outlets are almost non-existent.  It was a trick to figure out where to plug in an iron, iphone, or hairdryer if you didn't want to be tethered to an uncomfortable spot in the bathroom.

  3.  NO COFFEE MAKER??!!???!?  Do I really have to get dressed to go to the restaurant for coffee, or call room service?  This was particularly egregious because we were not told about the complimentary coffee at check-in, and only discovered it on our second morning (we did breakfast at Orchids the first morning.)

  4.  The concierges were generally outstanding, and very helpful with advice and arrangements.  However, it would be nice to have a more systematic card or listing of various hotel amenities and benefits, e.g. complimentary coffee, free museum passes, any deals with Nobu, the business center, etc.  Even the in-room binder missed some things.  While some items might come and go at any time, fiding out about various amenities seemed a litle haphazard.

Still -- we'd be back in a minute.  We have been to Honolulu a number of times, and decided it was time to stay at the Halekulani.  Yes, it is pricey, but there is so much to enjoy at this place that is unqiue to itself.","Date of stay: January 2011","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We had an ocean front room located on the eighth floor. From the moment our car pulled into the hotel the service was exceptional. Porters immediately opened our doors asked our name and took our luggage, which we would not see again until we arrived in our room. Possibly due to the hour (10 o’clock at night) there was no wait at the reception desk. Our reservations were ready for us and after a swipe of our credit card we were escorted to our room. Our receptionist showed us the features of the room and explained how to use the in room remote control station. The bottle of champagne that was waiting for us in the room to celebrate our anniversary was a very nice touch.
Many of the prior reviews on this website have mentioned how the rooms were outdated. This was not my impression. The photos that have been posted here do not do the room justice. It’s true that the rooms may need an update in the décor, but as far as the maintenance of the room we found nothing that looked used or worn.

The bathroom was huge. It contains a deep soaking tub that was larger than you will find in most homes, a separate shower stall, a well stocked vanity, and a separate water closet.  The water pressure in the shower was outstanding. It was truly so powerful it almost stung my skin. The shower controls were different than any I have seen, but it only takes about 5 seconds to figure them out. Honestly, the previous reviewers that had difficulty with them must also have trouble programming the clock on their microwave ovens. Bath amenities included mouthwash, shampoo, bath gel, bubble bath, q-tips, moisturizer, a sewing kit, and a separate make up mirror. At first I thought that the room should have had more bath towels and linens. This turned out to be a non-issue as the rooms was restocked and cleaned twice a day. We never had to ask for more towels and we generally took at least two baths or showers a day each. The bathrooms also come with two very comfortable terry cloth robes. As I am a bigger guy the one size fits all did not fit me. Five minutes after I called the desk to ask about a bigger size a housekeeper brought up two more robes for me to try on.

The room itself was large and well appointed. The large king bed was comfortable and the pillows were almost too soft. There was a couch, chair, coffee table, and a work desk that faced out over the lanai. It had a 42 inch HD television with more than the usual cable channels. The bedside remote control allows you to set the temperature for the air conditioning, turn lights off and on, as well as call for the housekeeper or porter. The other nightstand had an iPod dock that was a handy for recharging our phones. These rooms do not have black out curtains, but instead had louvered doors that slide to close off the glass lanai doors. These do not block out as much light as the curtains but certainly add to the look and ambiance of the room. One feature that I loved about the rooms and wish I could incorporate into my own house was the closet. It sits between the room and the bathroom and can be accessed from either room. This makes getting ready super efficient. The closet has multiple shelves on both ends and hangers for just about any kind of clothing. Another nice feature is the way the lights come on automatically when you open the doors. There is a small pantry area just as you enter the room. It contains a small refrigerator (stocked with free bottled water) and an ice bucket that is refreshed twice a day.

The lanai was large and clean. It had two chairs, a table, and a chaise lounge. The view was ocean front as advertised with the only drawback being the monstrous Sheraton Hotel next door that blocked what would have been a breathtaking view of Diamond Head.

Pros:

- Service: the best you will find. Every call answered quickly and they use your name when addressing you. All requests were filled quickly and with a friendly attitude. We never felt as though we were being an inconvenience. In this day and age that was truly refreshing. The service at the pool and restaurants was excellent also. 
- Security: some reviewers have mentioned the ever present gentlemen that patrol the hotel. They are dressed in business suits and we never found them to be unfriendly or intrusive. I was never asked for a room key or for my name, but I can see how their presence would keep out people who have not paid for the amenities that this very exclusive hotel offers. I personally found them to be very comforting to have around.
- Location: the Halekulani is in the middle of very busy Waikiki. However, once inside the hotel you would never know it. It was very quiet and peaceful. When you do leave the hotel you will find that your close to restaurants, stores, and all that Waikiki has to offer. The hotel does have a very small beach when compared to the beaches in front of most hotels, but again this adds to its exclusivity. If you wish to be on the busier more open part of the beach all you have to do is walk 50 to 100 yards in either direction.

Cons:

- The room safe is not appropriate for anyone with a laptop. It is large enough for a Kindle, wallets, cell phones, etc., but that is about it. This is something that needs to be addressed next year during the remodeling that is scheduled.
- There needs to be more outlets available for charging the many electronic devices we all carry even on vacation.
- Housekeeping often did not get to our room until one in the afternoon. This was surprising since there is a button in the room that lets them know when the room is going to be unoccupied and available for cleaning. It was frustrating to get back to the room after a morning of activities and know that housekeeping would still have to interrupt you.

Overall we were very happy with our stay at the Halekulani. I cannot say enough about the service. The prices this hotel charges is not for the faint of heart. You will probably spend more on a room here than anywhere else on Waikiki, but you get what you pay for.","Date of stay: January 2011","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

This hotel had a very nice hospitality suite which we used for our morning arrival; our 2 bedroom diamond head suite was available by noon. The suite itself was superb; it is a bit absent on color by design but it works. If you don't get the diamond head view here, you might as well be on any oceanfront anywhere. Food and beverage is strong and prices especially for kiddie food are pretty reasonable; Orchids restaurant and the House without a key are both good for breakfast and dinner. La Mer was excellent. Gym is smaller than I expected for a resort of this type; spa is really just some treatment rooms and a waiting area. Internet in the business center is fine. Location is ideal; you can walk anywhere but it is a retreat apart. Sunset watching hula with the big tree and the ocean and the diamond head view is a unique experience and we had to pull the kids away since they enjoyed it so much when it was time to leave. Negative here is that when the hotel is busy you may not get a chaise lounge and/or umbrella at the pool unless you come early to stake your claim; there is no hotel service on the beach and the beach itself has coarse sand and cold water; the pool in the hotel is at 82 degrees but a bit chilly for my taste; and we had long waits for food at Orchids for breakfast even for the kiddie food, especially if you come in after 10:30am when the buffet has ended next door. Management did come over to apologize to us and helped us move the food faster during our second and third day on the property. We enjoyed the lounge acts in the bar, particularly the solo piano player who was on at the beginning of the week. Concierge desk is always manned with several people and this was a particularly good thing. We enjoyed the trolley rides around Waikeke and the Polynesian Village and Dole Plantation near the North Shore.  Rental car arranged from the concierge with pickup and dropoff with the hotel valet was a major convenience. Expect to see lots of Japanese weddings on the property and lots of Japanese -- hotel is owned by a Japanese corporation. The Japanese are a plus here; they want to spend money on upper tier labels and the Waikeke area has beautified and catered to Japanese tastes in anticipation of their dollars. Hotel's boutique has beautiful items in it. Hotel is half an hour from the airport. Service was very friendly and the manager was hands on and helped look after us.

All the shops and restaurants in Waikiki are within walking distance so it's perfectly situated. Unfortunately the hotel's beach is very small but after a little walk you'll have lots of it.
The service is wonderful as expected.
We were afraid of the rooms which looked like motel-rooms from the 80's according to some pictures in Tripadvisor. But when we saw them ""live"" it was completely different!
They are kept in a simple, white style so the guests won't be distracted from the spectacular colors of nature outside.
We didn't like the shower but they told us it's a Japanese company and the Japanese guests prefer bathtubs. So they unfortunately don't care about the shower. Well, they should upgrade their showers to better fit the rest of the beautiful bathroom.

The Halekulani was the epitome of luxury from the moment we stepped into the lobby.  The rooms are very white and natural, understated luxury with really nice bathrooms and vanity.  Champagne, chocolates and fruit were delivered upon our arrival and little treats would arrive each evening. We did not have an issue with an early check-in or late check-out.  The location here is great, you can literally walk out of the hotel and find upscale shopping, restuarants just a few steps away.  (There is a Denny's across the street where we ate breakfast once to save a few dollars, which was convenient and good).  Despite the lively scene just outside, the Halekulani is extremely peaceful and tranquil - also very formal, so it might feel a little stuffy to some.  The beach at the Halekulani is basically inaccessible but the pool area is nice (though small) and you can walk down a bit to access the beach.  We mainly stayed here to do Pearl Harbor, which was about 20 minutes away via taxi.  

One issue we had was with the concierge - we asked them about the best way to get to Pearl Harbor and they were, plainly, not very helpful.  They told us just to take a taxi - well, it cost $50 or so each way.....we could have easily rented a car for this price and seen more of the island of Oahu.  We later complained to the manager about this and they apologized and made a small credit to our bill.  We were just dissapointed that they didn't suggest a car rental to begin with or advise how costly the taxi would be.  

We used the spa, which was small but lovely. We both had pedicures which were heavenly!!

We also did the Sunday brunch at Orchids.  Although it was expensive, it was the BEST brunch we have ever experienced and my husband was in all his glory - we ate for hours and didn't eat again all day....

The conceirge desk helped us every time to arrange tours, taxis, cars, drinks, whatever and it is everything I would expect from a top class hotel. They are, without question, the best face of this place.

As for thr rooms, well, we had a Junior Suite and it was perferct for what we wanted. Balconies (Lanai) on 2 sides, superb sea views, what more could you want? If there was one thing that could be improved then the bathrooms are looking a little dated. No Jacuzzi spa bath and fairly austere decor and hilariously, those funny ""wash one's bottom"" type of toilet seats which I thought were a 1970's Japanese style joke.

The restaurants, it has to be said were excellent - best crab sandwich ever (order Jo's surprise on bread) with gentle, Hawaiin style evening entertainment. This really make it a true Hawaiin experience for us non-locals.

Apart from that the gym is OK if you get in there on your own and open the windows to get the full pool-sea view experience.

The pool is OK, again service excellent poolside, my only (minor) issue being the usual one of enough available loungers under the shade that haven't been bagged previously by non-existant persons.","Date of stay: December 2010","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Even the immigration officer at Honololu airport was impressed that we were staying there!

Positives:
* Great location - right on the beach, close to shops.
* Nice room - very comfortable. Nice view of the ocean.
* Got a complimentary bottle of Champagne, as a honeymoon gift from the Hotel -- nice touch.
* Very helpful staff.
* Very nice pool area, with deck chairs, right next to a nice quiet part of the beach.

Negatives:
* Room was  small -- with very little storage for clothes etc. Not great for stays longer than 1 or 2 nights.
* Service was sometimes slow (but this seems standard for all hotels in Hawaii) -- took them an hour to get us empty plates for breakfast, and spare towels.
* Waikiki itself is a bit far from downtown Honolulu, Pearl Habour and the Airport. A round trip to Pearl Habour or the Airport is about $80 by taxi (bus is very slow and inconvenient).

But if you are headed to Honolulu, you probably want to stay in Waikiki. And the Halekulani is probably among the best hotels there.","Date of stay: November 2010","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We arrived early and reception, a gentleman, was very nice, offering their courtesy room while we waited. We hadn't had lunch though so decided to go try The Pineapple Room (recommended on Frommer's) down the street and return when our room was ready. At the 3pm check-in time, our room was still not ready -- it wouldn't have been an issue to me had they not told us 2 hours earlier that it would most definitely be ready at 3. I kind of felt like they were placating me. This time, the woman at reception, did not offer us the courtesy room so I asked. She acted put out which didn't help my mood. Thankfully, our stay DID improve although it didn't help that our room was set up for twin beds and rather than fix it, they offered us a change of room with a nice view but not as nice as the one we had (I went to see it before making a decision). They fixed the bed situation and the rest of our trip was seamless.

I believe we stayed in an ocean view room (it's hard to tell from the website room location map -- even the concierge said it was a horrible map and she rec'd complaints all of the time about the colors). Our room was located, not ocean front but to the side, overlooking the pool. The balcony was large and had 2 chairs, a small table and a lounge chair. After we put our daughter down for bed, we'd sit out there with a cocktail or bottle of wine and just enjoy ourselves.

The room wasn't as expansive as our cottage at Turtle Bay but it was sufficient and certainly no smaller than most city hotel rooms. I've stayed in smaller and larger. There were 3 of us (our daughter slept in the bed with us) and there was plenty of room. I packed one very large suitcase rather than having to worry about multiple suitcases and we opened it up on the floor of the closet and it was fine. The closet opens up on the bathroom side & the bedroom side with sliding mirrored doors. 

The mattresses were a little hard for me and I didn't care for the pillows (I prefer multiple, very soft, down pillows -- my husband tells me I'm a pillow snob) and thus, I didn't sleep well. That said, finding a mattress and pillows that satisfy me when we travel isn't easy. 

The decor was spare and tasteful. Nothing to write home about but nothing to complain about either. The bathroom was large, white tiles, the toilet had a door to it and there was a separate bath and shower. The toiletries were scent-free, which is neither here nor there to me but my mom is extremely sensitive to smell so I noticed it. They restock them every day regardless of whether you use them. Since we checked our bags, I took the lot at the end of our trip, wrapped them in one of the plastic laundry bags and donated them to a homeless shelter here at home (it's what I always do with unopened, hotel toiletries).  Over the tub, there's a retractable clothesline. It's not high up but sufficient for hanging wet bathing suits, etc.

On the Wednesday night we were there, they held a manager's reception that was quite lovely. It was right before our early dinner reservations so my husband and I didn't eat any of the hors d'oeuvres but our daughter had a small snack and the staff was so terrific -- they helped her with her plate and got her a ""cocktail"" that she was so proud of.

There is a dress code at certain events / restaurants at this hotel and while my husband and I didn't go fancy, I was a little surprised at how ratty some of the people felt comfortable dressing when the ""rules"" were pretty clear. Yes, it's Hawaii but if a collared shirt is required, showing up in a logo'd tshirt isn't respectful.

We ate at Orchids and a House Without A Key at the hotel and thought they were both fine. The service was terrific at both although I think we preferred Orchids. House without a Key seemed a little hectic to me and you were still able to enjoy the entertainment at Orchids without being quite so close.

Although I wouldn't say this hotel is kid-friendly (not in the way Turtle Bay felt), the staff was amazingly accommodating. Clearly they are used to couples who have established tastes in travel that now have children and aren't interested in staying in a Motel 6 simply because they have children. The pool staff was great to our daughter; they had a supply of inner tubes and when she decided she wanted a different color, they cheerfully supplied her with one before we could even try to argue with her. At the restaurants, they had entertainment packs (either drawing or these great things called wikisticks - sp?) and a children's menu. We were never made to feel as if she was a bother or unwelcome. Traveling with a young child can be difficult and the staff's friendliness and attention to the little things, like inner tubes!, helped make our stay more relaxing and enjoyable.

The pool is small but nice and it wasn't busy (we were there the 2nd week in Nov). The staff friendly and accommodating. Plenty of chairs and according to my husband, the pool was heated. Not many children but there were more than a few, all well-behaved from what I could tell.

The beach in front of the hotel was less crowded than many areas in Waikiki although I found that besides a quick dip in the ocean, I preferred the serenity of the pool. I liken Waikiki to Vegas and the Halekulani to the Four Seasons in Vegas -- it's an oasis in the middle of chaos. The noise and the crowds just aren't as extreme at the Halekulani. If you're interested in a party scene, go next door to the Sheraton -- or any of the hotels on that side and you can experience the wall-to-wall people. When I was in my 20s, perhaps, that would have seemed exciting but now I have no interest in it and it's much more pleasant to be away from all of that. Honestly, I have very little interest in returning to Waikiki but if I do, I can't imagine staying anywhere except the Halekulani -- it's on the beach but without the masses of people and it feels so much more civilized. We were there for only 3 nights and there are some restaurants I'd like to try and some sightseeing that wasn't appropriate with a 4 year old (Pearl Harbor & Shangri-la) but the beach on the North Shore is much more spectacular and if I feel like wall to wall people, Vegas is a shorter flight. 

Note: The North Shore isn't for everyone. It's definitely more low-key, lay around, hang out in flip-flops and I'm not sure there's any night life. If you want night life and fancy dinners out, Waikiki is definitely your best bet on Oahu. It all depends on why you're going to Hawaii and what kind of experience you want. 

The Halekulani website: I'd say the room pictures are accurate depictions. The beautiful picture of the hotel in the evening, with an empty stretch of beach (click ""Overview"") is not because the beach is probably never that free of people and the picture of the pool is outstanding photography because I can't figure out how they made the pool look that large (it's sufficient in size but definitely not large).

Random - We did check out the rooms at the Sheraton, next door, just to see what they were like. They provided a key in exchange for ID and a credit card, which they returned when we returned the key. I've forgotten the room number, but it was an ocean front room. It was situated much like a Motel 6, I assume. The balcony was fine but our room at the Halekulani was much nicer and I admit, that I was spoiled after that. It had one of those bath/shower stalls and 2 double (not queen) beds. While our suitcase fit exactly into the closet, laying down, of the Halekulani, I wasn't sure where it would fit in this room at all as there simply wasn't that much space. The room was dated and while it was definitely less expensive than the Halekulani, that seemed the only appeal. The Sheraton's lobby also gave me that Vegas-vibe with stores, lots of people and sprawl whereas the lobby of the Halekulani felt more sophisticated and calming.

One last thing -- the concierge offered to print our plane tickets the day before our flight. While they do have a business center, it was incredibly convenient to place a phone call and have this taken care of for us and I very much appreciated the service.","Date of stay: November 2010","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Large and luxurious bathrooms. There was complementary check in fruit, cheese, wine and chocolates. Also nightly bed turn down with a different small gift each time. The restaurants were great and so was the pool. The beach in front isn't crowded for Waikiki, same for the pool area. The lounge chairs were plentiful with some in the grass area, which I like. Not really a great place for kids although there were several very happy families. Also not a great place for singles.","Date of stay: November 2010","Trip type: Traveled on business","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We stayed here for 6 nights for our Honeymoon in November and we didn’t want to leave! It was the last week of our 3 week honeymoon to Hawaii and the Halekulani was by far the best hotel we have stayed at, it was the perfect end to our trip. We had booked at partial ocean view room and were upgraded to an Ocean View room with a fantastic view of the ocean. This hotel is located seconds away from all the best shopping and Restaurants you could image!  The service is of the highest quality.

When we arrive we were escorted by very friendlt and knowledgeable staff to our gorgeous room on the 17th floor (top floor) such an amazing view. The room was spacious and very clean. Massive bathroom and lovely bright airy feeling.  The first 5 nights we stayed in an Ocean View room. So gorgeous. 
The pool was great. Pool boys let you choose a sun lounge and they lay a towel down for you and bring you water and ice blocks! Great pool menu too with fast service. 
After 5 wonderful nights at this paradise we had unfortunately prebooked 5 nights at the Hilton Hawaiian Village for the remainder of our stay in Waikiki. We didn't want to leave! Our beautiful hostess, Joy, invited us to come back for the last 2 nights so we only had to stay at the Hilton 3 nights. Thank god! The Hilton was pretty terrible. No service at all. Our ""ocean view room"" was not what I call ocean view at all. Had a view of the man made lagoon. Not impressed. Our last 2 nights at the Halekulani were bliss! We were upgraded to ocean front again on the top floor. Again amazing service. We can't wait to return to this beautiful hotel. Fabulous location right near Waikiki's best restaurants and faultless service.","Date of stay: November 2010","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The honeymoon couple who spent only two nights at the Halekulani and gave a negative review, either are very young, unsophisticated travelers or are so picky that nothing can please them. The Halekulani is the top hotel on Oahu. 

Other hotels give you a lei upon arrival. It’s a common practice, but not every five star hotel does that. If you never heard of the Halekulani, why expect the lei? At the Halekulani, there is tropical fruit and chocolates waiting for you in your room instead of a lei. Having a staff member escort you to your room is different than just shoving a key in your hand and pointing the way. It is a personalized way to check in. Not like the Hilton Hawaiian Village where the reception desk staff doesn’t even look at you.

I don’t know about any ant problem. I stayed at the hotel for 10 nights and did not encounter any ants. I find it interesting that the honeymoon couple complained to the owner of the hotel when in fact, it is owned by a corporation in Japan. 

If the couple did their homework, they would know that there is a tiny beach in front of the Halekulani. All they had to do was walk a couple of steps to the beach in front of the Sheraton – not a lengthy walk! The gorgeous orchid tile pool is the biggest swimming pool in Waikiki. Of course, there were children, it was summer! The pool staff are the most friendly guys around, and they do not ‘stalk’ the guests to see if anybody snuck in to the pool. I’ve stayed at this hotel for close to 20 years, and never ever saw that.

If the couple would rather have stayed at the Hilton or Hyatt, they don’t deserve to stay at the Halekulani!

From the minute you arrive, you are treated like family. The staff – no matter if it’s the Bell/Valet staff, Reception, Concierge, Pool, Restaurant or Housekeeping staff – are so professional, efficient and friendly. 

The rooms are a nice size with a big bathroom. If you have a Diamond, Ocean view room, you can take a shower and stare out at Diamond Head at the same time. The rooms, as clean and fresh as can be, are a little dated – but there will be a multi-million dollar renovation next year.

There is an abundant buffet breakfast at House Without A Key – the hotel’s indoor-outdoor dining with made-to-order omlettes. You can also order off the menu at Orchids. The Sunday Brunch at Orchids is to die for – the biggest brunch buffet on the island. At sunset, you can sip your tropical drinks while watching former Miss Hawaii, beautiful Kanoe Miller dance the hula to the sounds of the Sunset Serenaders. The Halekulani is really paradise in paradise.","Date of stay: October 2010","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

It's hard for me to understand how a person could stay at the Halekulani and not be charmed by the hotel.  The hotel manages to create a serene oasis in the midst of action-packed waikiki.  The service is first rate.  The public spaces are casual yet elegant.  The restaurants (allowing for each restaurant's format) are as good as you can expect from (and as this reviewer has ever had at) a beach hotel and are in lovely settings.   I agree the rooms are not the largest and probably could be ""updated"", but they are completely comfortable and I very much doubt there are more luxurious rooms on Waikiki.   I hope those doing research are not influenced by those reviewers who focus one or two points and cannot discern what a special hotel Halekulani is.  It's a class act. 

Strong points
-beautiful public spaces
-very good restaurants
-first rate service 
-great cocktails (redefined the mai tai for me)
-special touches
-great location
-excellent blend of a resort and a city hotel

Things to know
-hotel does not have a beach set up
-resort wear in the evening
-spa on small side but highly recommend lomi lomi massages","Date of stay: September 2010","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Quiet yet exciting, elegant but accesible.  Just about perfect.  
I moved from the Sheraton-Waikiki because the Sheraton-Waikiki was not nice at all and with a room rate of $450.00 per night, it was way too expensive.  The Halekulani had one room left and I was lucky enough to get it. The food is excellent and fair for the price.  The gourmet restaurant was great. I showed up thirty minutes before closing and completely drunk.  The staff helped me eat some hangover friendly foods and sent me on my way in way better shape than when I got there.  
Front desk is very professional as is the entire staff I interacted with.  I was left alone to sleep and work and that made it a great stay for me.  I was told by some folks at the Sheraton that the Halekulani is the only five star hotel on Waikiki.  No caveats that I can share.

Really doesn't feel like there is a beach 100 yards away.  Kinda like stepping in a time machine or something.  Dress code is a nice touch as long as you know a head of time.  It adds to the atmosphere of the place.  It's nice that you have to think ahead and plan to come to a place like this, even if it is as simple as putting on a collared shirt.  The jazz piano was a great touch and really fits the vibe of this place.  Only complaint was our drinks weren't as special as we had hoped after seeing the great reviews.  We tried a strawberry-basil one that was kinda syrupy and a chocolate martini that was average.  I ordered a few drinks that were not on the menu to see what the bartender had up his sleeve.

Why 4 stars and not 5? While the hotel's staff couldn't be more professional, kind and efficient, and the views from our room could not be beaten, there are a few things Halekulani could improve upon, to make it a true 5 star hotel, and also a 5 star rated review here. The rooms are impeccably clean however, wear and tear is a bit obvious and a modern upgrade is definitely in order. Another strange downside was that I'd left my hat (It was just an LA baseball cap) in our rental car one night and the next day it was missing. Okay, it wasn't such a valuable item in monetary terms but was a sentimental item for me since it was a gift. Lastly, I'd gotten very ill on the trip and for a couple of days I stayed in the hotel. It was very sweet of the management to call and check in on me (housekeeping must have alerted him), so kudos for that. He let me know where the closest doctor was so I could get treatment if necessary. My complaint here is that a 5 star hotel (for example, the Ritz Carlton, Four Seasons) would offer to actually take me to the doctor themselves. I was in no condition to drive being sick and having jetlag (12 hour difference since I live in Europe) and my husband is not comfortable driving (he is not from the U.S and doesn't drive much in the first place). Sure it's easy to take a taxi; I'm just emphasizing that exceptional service from a 5 star hotel would have included going above and beyond regular hotel standards. Other than those few things, it's a quiet, clean, comfortable, well located, has great views, not to mention home to an amazing French restaurant, with a friendly multilingual staff and a delicious Japanese breakfast option (I love Japanese breakfasts) in one of the restaurants downstairs.","Date of stay: June 2009","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

We had stayed at the Hyatt Regency Maui first followed by the Grand Hyatt Kauai. Our travel agent talked us out of staying at the Hyatt as well as the Hilton (my husband loves his Hilton points), as we were told those hotels were significantly inferior to the two Hyatt’s we had just stayed at. We were not supposed to be let down for our last two nights of our honeymoon, so we were referred to Halenkulani, a five-star hotel, one of the original hotels on Waikiki Beach. It boasts a fabulous reputation along with an excellent location on Waikiki Beach. 
We arrive at the hotel, our bags are taken from us and we are brought to the front lobby. Someone is nosily vacuuming the carpet. Who does that at 3pm? We are then told to sit and wait, while we wait for the front desk to allow us to check in. We did not receive a lei greeting, which surprised me since the ‘only a four-star’ Grand Hyatt in Kauai did as soon as we emerged from our car.  I expected it since we were staying at a prestigious five-star hotel, but we didn’t get one. We are escorted to our room, up the elevator by an employee who goes into our room with us and shows us everything in the room. I thought this was kind of strange. I kind of wanted just to collapse on the bed as soon as we walked in. about 15 minutes later our bags arrived. 
The room wasn’t super big. It had a decent sized ocean front balcony, which overlooked the pool. It had a small table, a few chairs and a chase lounge. The bed was big and comfy. Internet was “complimentary” but when you’re paying the five-star hotel price, it had better be. The bathroom square footage appeared spacious. The tub was ok, there was only one sink and they only left us three towels, not four. So we could only shower once a piece and have a clean towel without having to call housekeeping. The shower… 1972 called and asked for it back. When we were given our strange ‘room orientation’ by the hotel employee she had to tell us how to use it. I’ve stayed in older, non-fancy hotels and all of them had more up-to-date showers than this place. Also, by the sink, there were ants crawling up and down the wall. It was pretty gross. 
When we got back from dinner, we did come back to champagne and classical music playing on the TV, in honor of our honeymoon. We got this from the four-star Hyatt in Kauai also, so I was definitely expecting them to do something.  This was a plus side to our stay here.
After our first night, we got up really early to see Pearl Harbor, leaving the hotel at 6am. We returned at about 1:30 pm, dying for a nap. We come back to the room to find that housekeeping never came by, the bed was un-made and lacked clean towels. I was pretty upset by this. It’s a five-star hotel and we were gone for 7.5 hours. I expect my bed to be made up! My husband called the front desk with our complaint and they explained they only send housekeeping around once a day and they don’t get to that floor until late afternoon. This doesn’t make any sense to me since this would be the time a lot of people would be showering and preparing for their dinner plans. So he explains to them that he’s not happy and he doesn’t not want housekeeping interrupting our day, we’ll go without them stopping by. I lay down to take a nap and about 45 minutes later I am woken up by housekeeping banging on the door to clean our room. So much for my nap. I kindly told her we already told the front desk we didn’t want them to make up the room and that we were trying to take a nap. 
When we returned from dinner that night, my husband complained to the hotel owner about our ant problem, their non-conventional late afternoon maid service and our general disappointment of their highly rated hotel. He was nice and offered us a complimentary brunch buffet at Orchids as well as an extended checkout to 5pm the following day since we had a 8pm flight. This came in handy, as we were both well fed and could relax for the last few hours of our honeymoon. 
Lastly, I’ll comment on the beach and pool situation. I don’t know what exactly is meant by the term ‘best location on Waikiki Beach’ because there is no physical beach at this location. If you want to walk out on actual sand, you have to take a lengthy walk to another hotel. There is no beach. There are waves crashing into a man-made wall. This was disappointing. The pool was small, crowded and full of screaming children. It was the least romantic part of our honeymoon. It also closed pretty early at night, unlike the pools at the Maui and Kauai Hyatts, which were open 24/7. Only some of the pool staff was friendly. I was offered a cool towel and frozen fruit bar. I was never approached by anyone asking me if I wanted to order lunch or cocktail. They looked at me and walked right past me. Not that I was going to order anything off their over-priced and limited selection menu, but I was never offered any service. The pool staff was constantly stalking the guests to see if non-guests had sneaked into the property. Three people were booted while we were there. I don’t know why more hotels don’t adapt the towel card, disposable bracelet system that the Hyatt Regency Maui has. Its quick, simple and no one feels stalked as they sit by the pool.
Overall, the value isn’t that great here. Several portions of this place are in desperate need of updating and you’re paying exorbitantly high room rates to feed into their five-star status and reputation. We certainly do not recommend this hotel and we regret not going with our gut and staying at the Hilton or Hyatt.","Date of stay: July 2010","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

Truly a house befitting heaven!","What would stop you falling in love with this hotel? Nothing! We spent 12 nights at the Halekulani as part of our honeymoon. Upon arrival you are greeted by the charming, friendly staff into an oasis of calm amidst the bustle of Waikiki. The hotel and our 3rd floor ocean front room were spotlessly clean, bright and airy. 

The food is superb, whether it's at the relaxed House Without A Key, where there is a nightly band and hula dancer, or the slightly more formal Orchids. We didn't eat at La Mer as we simply ran out of time. Maybe next time!

It is hard not to relax amongst the swaying palm trees that surround the beautiful swimming pool where the attentive but not claustrophobic pool staff take care of your every need. Oh and you must try the frozen lemonade!

If shopping is your thing then just a short walk from the hotel is everything from Tiffany & Co, Prada and Louis Vitton to the International Market Place and many other fabulous Waikiki shops and restaurants.

As a wheelchair user space to manoeuvre freely and easily is essential and was never a problem in our spacious room or in any other part of the hotel. Accessibility is easily achieved without fuss or drama. Apart from the two subtle, gently sloping ramps to help you access Orchids and the Garden Terrace the rest of the hotel is accessible via the same corridors and paths as everyone else.

The Halekulani has wonderful stall, fabulous food, magical views and is a must visit hotel.

The hotel is absolutely beautiful and everything you would expect from a 5* Hawaiian hotel with open reception/lobby area and lush greeney and flowers everywhere. We landed from the UK late and check in could not have been smoother. We were ushered straight away to our room and checked in, in the comfort of our room at the sofas by one of the desk clerks. We ordered room service which arrived very swiftly indeed and crashed out. The next day we explored the hotel a bit and ate breakfast in one of the two main restaurants. One of them serves a buffet breakfast and the other a server a la carte breakfast. Both delicious although we opted for the buffet breakfast most mornings as it had everything you wanted and if it didnt you could ask for it. The banana pancakes were to die for! 

The pool was an absolute delight to sit around - beds were always available and on arriving at a chosen bed, one of the pool attendants would rush over with towels to cover the beds and for drying. Suncream was available in big dispensors too as were magazines. The pool bar was a little pricey but expected in this hotel! The hotel is very well located a short walk from all the main areas of Honolulu for shopping and eating. There is a mall a short bus ride away which has some fabulous shops and the concierge couldnt have been more helpful in terms of suggesting activities and arranging and booking them for us too! This hotel was an absolute dream and yes it was very expensive, but I would go back there in a heart beat and hopefully one day we will!","Date of stay: May 2010","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We had a great stay at the Halekulani. From the moment ""Aulani"" greeted us, it began a journey of sophistication that bordered on the sublime. The service friendly and attentive, the rooms luxurious, and the Diamond Head view was incredible.

We had just come from four seasons at Maui which the halekulani is not but what a fantastic location to see honululu. The shops are very close the beach next door and good local restaurants. We also went for dinner at la mer which was the best we had in all the islands truly a fantastic meal. We went for cocktails in the lewers lounge which was very elegant. Overall this hotel is great if you want to have some real elegant diners and cocktails it is not a lie on the lounger hotel which the four seasons is but then this is honululu not  Maui. The room was ok I felt a bit small for a top hotel and I would agree that unless you get a full ocean view you do look right into others rooms. It was a bit like a scene from Hitchcocks Room with a view. 
The hotel does cater for japenese tourist market and I would say 80 per cent of the guests were japenese. 

The concierge was very good and the private check in was a great idea. However as said the room was a bit small and we could only access the wardrobe from the bathroom which was strange.  

However the hotel is an oasis in Honolulu and I enjoyed it overall. However coming from unbridled excellence of the four seasons probably put a bit of a damper on it.","Date of stay: August 2010","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

But our son was playing baseball in Honolulu for the summer so twice my husband and I spent a few days in Waikiki to watch him and we really got to know the place. Our first stay was at the Halekulani based on the reviews. We weren't disappointed and our next stay was at the Royal Hawaiian and in that review I have compared the two hotels. What we liked about the Halekulani was the following: the room was really well-appointed. It had some very nice features including that the closet can be accessed from the bedroom or the bathroom, the room was nicely decorated, the air-conditioning automatically shuts off when the sliding glass door to the balcony is opened, the balcony had a table, 2 chairs and a chaise lounge, the view was beautiful looking down the beach, there was fruit in our room which we enjoyed our first morning, service throughout the hotel was the best I've experienced in North America. We booked dinner at different restaurants away from the hotel each night through the hotel concierges and they were fabulous. Even though it was always at the last minute, the concierge always got us a good time and a great table. We only ate at the hotel a couple of times - a late snack in the bar when we arrived at night, and breakfast one morning. These were fine but the other hotel restaurants had strict dress codes and we aren't interested in dressing like that in Hawaii. We like open-air Hawaiian-themed restaurants, preferably on the beach and there were many closeby. We had good dinners at Roys (right across the street), the Beach House (in the Moana Surfrider), and Hula Grill (just down the beach).
We valet parked our rental car and the valets were very quick and friendly. They also stored our rental bikes for us. (Note: we found that Honolulu is not very bike-friendly so biking was not as pleasant as we had hoped for.)
The hotel really is quiet compared to the crazy hustle and bustle just outside of it. The atmosphere is quite formal for a Hawaiian hotel and they really cater to a large Japanese tourist trade.
The negatives for the Halekulani were that the beach is really tiny and the pool is quite busy. But we were busy watching baseball during the days so it wasn't an issue. We could always get a chaise lounge at the pool when we wanted and it was nice to be able to order food at the pool. Also, although the view from our 8th floor room was very nice, it also included looking at the building across the courtyard so we had to close our shutters at least partway at night or the people across the way would be looking right into our room. We like to sleep with our sliding glass door wide open and the breeze blowing in listening to the waves but we couldn't see the nice view because the shutters were closed. 
All in all, we really enjoyed staying at this hotel and we would recommend it to anyone but next time we are trying a different hotel to get a more casual Hawaiian experience. If we stayed here again, we would ask for a room at the end of the building so that we wouldn't be looking at another building across from us and the view down the beach would be better.","Date of stay: July 2010","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I have previously booked the Royal Hawaiin and changed my mind at the last minute because my husband wanted a room with a balcony.  We like the more modern looking rooms and were worried that we would not like the style of the Halekulani.
We had a ocean view room on the 7th floor in the second tower. Not the one that wraps around the pool. Although the room was outdated, it was big, comfortable and very clean. The two way closet that could be opened from the bathroom was a great idea.
The pool and grounds were extremely nice and food was good. The service was amazing in all areas. Housekeeping, laundry, restaurants and concierge were all great. I have never received such good service anywhere before. I loved the Halekulani so much that I booked a few nights on my way home to Australia from my travels in the US. This time I was travelling alone and I was always offered books or magazines when dining by myself. Very welcoming. The hotel is very quiet so maybe stay elsewhere if you like a more modern party scene. Definately reccomend staying here and below are a few pros and cons, not being picky on the cons but for the price to stay here I thought I would make a thorough review.
Cons
1. Most of the rooms although ocean view are parallel to other rooms so there is not much privacy. Maybe try and get an oceanfront room to avoid this. The ocean could only be viewed from our balcony. I was a bit annoyed at this at first but was too jetlagged to complain.
2. On my return stay I had a garden view room. This was in the tower that wrapped around the pool. Room 832. This room was much smaller and not as practical as the ocean view room. But still very nice.
3. On our first night we had that many knocks at the door giving us ice, drinks, cookies, chcocolates, fruit that it became a little annoying. We had to put the do not disturb up.
4. We did not eat at Orchirds or Le mer becasue of their strict dress code. No jeans. Jacket required. Also we werent allowed to drink at Lewers lounge because my husbane wasnt appropriately dressed (he had a dress shirt, jeans and dress shoes on) which was disappointing. I think they should lower the dress code a little, it is Hawaii and we were on vacation. 
5. Pool furniture needs to be updated or cleaned.
Pros
Great room (ocean view) great bathroom and wardrobe.
Extremely clean. Room serviced quickly when we went out in the mornings.
Free bottled water daily.
If we went out for the day we were always offered fruit, towels and water.
Our breakfast was included and on our final day we had to leave before seven so they delivered to our room whatever items we choose before our 5.45am start.
Great pool area, nice an relaxing 
No beach directly out the front but a little swimming area and only a few hundred meters if you wanted to sit on the beach
Nice Hawaiin band everynight at House Without a Key. This was a quiet but entertaining way to spend the evening.
Buffet breakfast very good. 
Service was amazing, best ever in all areas. 
Gym was adequate
Great location, shops, restaurants directly behind hotel.
Free wireless internet and great business room for use of computers and printing
Offered car rental by conceirge. Just has to show licence and the car was there waiting. Just has to return keys to front desk. Very convienent.

I am planning a return visit to Waikki just to stay at the Halekulani. I would say that this was the best place I have ever stayed at because of the hospitality.
Also if you want a nice steak meal, try Ruth Chris's Steakhouse just at the back under the Embassy, we went there twice.","Date of stay: July 2010","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I knew of the Halekulani for years as I was a travel agent for 10 years and sent some clients their who loved their stay. However I was put off a bit by the price and the sheer choice one has when choosing a hotel in Waikiki.

I was very happy with my choice. The Halekulani is really a little slice paradise in a bustling city. I read many reviews on trip advisor. So many love Halekulani but I also have read some negative reviews of this hotel. First off one MUST put thing in perspective. This is a CITY resort/hotel. This is not a resort located on sprawling acres of property. Therefore the beach is small and the Halekulani lacks a very large fitness center and some other amenties like jacuzzis and other things. In return you get immaculate accomodations, relaxing surroundings and excellent attentive service.

I honestly have no desire to return to Waikiki exept to stay at the Halekulani. I much prefer Maui and Kaui for a beach vacation. Nevertheless the Halekulani's service and atmosphere is what sets it apart.

The hotel is low key. If you want entertainment at every corner look elsewhere. This is not the Wynn or another type of ""hip"" resort/hotel. It is all about understated casual elegance not about having a room full of gadgets.Its about the staff that remembers you by name, the nightly ""gifts"", having a staff who anticipates your needs even before you voice them. This is my experience from the Halekulani. 

I had an oceanview room on the 8th floor. The room was very spacious and immaculate. It had a large flat screen tv, 3 phones, refridge, and a control panle by the bed that controlled room features like lights and maid service. The bathroom was very spacious and provided access to the bedroom closet which was a great feature.

I have stayed in many 5 star hotels and resorts like many different Ritz Carltons, Enchantment Resort in Arizona, The Wynn, The Borgata, The Majestic in Rome and I have to say the service here was excellent. From the in room check-in even to checking out everything was seemless and done with a smile. I even tried tipping many of the staff and they politely did not accept. Growing up and living in the NYC area my whole life this comes as a shock to me!","Date of stay: July 2010","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We felt really pampered by good service, in a great location. The Halekulani felt like a haven of quiet in the intensity of Waikiki. Our partial-ocean-view room was exceptionally quiet, which made for a great night's sleep.

We especially enjoyed lounging by the pool all afternoon, ordering off the menu of delicious drinks (Mai Tais and Lava Flows) and sandwiches, plus the best french fries I've ever had, served in a beautiful black lacquered box. It was a relaxing environment, with not too many kids around -- and those who were around were well-mannered and well supervised by their parents.

Staff was generally very attentive and solicitous. Frank at the concierge desk was particularly helpful. The HWAK servers were generally good, although the hostess was a tad snippy one evening.

My only suggestion is that they should give out leis at check-in, as many high-end hotels in Hawaii do. That would have been consistent with the Aloha spirit we encountered at the Halekulani.","Date of stay: July 2010","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

However, we were paying about 2 grand a night and they had to move us because they first tried to put us in a suite (same category) over looking a roof to the ocean. Umm. Ya. I don't think so. So we moved before we unpacked. We were staying with our kids and my in-laws. So here is my review:
 
The Good:
 
The room was beautiful and the view (after moving rooms) was spectacular. 
The hotel had a very low key glamorous feel to it. Not overdone, but classy.
The location was nice, right on the beach.
It was not crowded.
There are some nice shops right in the hotel. I bought a bunch of Vera Wang stuff and had it shipped home.
 
 
The bad:
 
The pool was tiny.
It was ""too quiet""
 
The Ugly:
 
None
 
I would recommend this place for a romantic getaway if you have to be near shopping and night life. Otherwise there are plenty of other more beautiful places to go. I don't recommend it for families with kids. We got more than a few dirty looks from people that we brought kids with us. Hello? It's Hawaii!
 
Anyway.. I would come back some day after my kids are all grown up.

For Honolulu, we considered the Halekulani and The Kahala (Hotel & Resort).  We also considered the Ritz-Carlton in Kapalua, Maui. 

Although we are tourists ourselves, we really want to stay away from big, noisy crowds.  We also want to be near a beach without making a beach trip a whole excursion in it of itself.  Prior to our trip, we decided to stay at the Halekulani on the first half of our trip, and then move to the Kahala for the second half.  We wanted to get the vibe of Waikiki and then end it with a relaxing stay away from the bustle. We also wanted to be able to experience both hotels in one shot.  

What we did not realize was how secluded the Halekulani was from the hustle & bustle of Waikiki, and how nice the room would be.  We upgraded to an ocean front room on the fourth floor, where our room overlooked the beautiful orchid pool, and then the ocean just beyond it.  We slept with our balcony doors open every night so that we can hear the waves.  The hotel was removed enough from the crowds, yet close enough to walk to the main strip of Waikiki and the shops.  At first I was a bit weary because of how seemingly close the hotel was to the main strip, but it was far enough that our room (and resort) was surprisingly quiet.  The staff was courteous and helpful.  Everyone was just so friendly.  And, we felt completely secure on the resort.  What we enjoyed about staying at the Halekulani were 1) the view and sounds of the ocean, 2) the nightly entertainment at the House without a Key (music and performances), and 3) the easy access to everything.  Our stay was comfortable and relaxing.  The hotel and the staff truly deserve a 5-star rating.  

We visited the Kahala mid-vacation, but we just did not get the same ""wow"" feeling as when we first walked into our room at the Halekulani.  So, we cancelled our reservation at the Kahala and extended our stay at the Halekulani.  We had no regrets doing so.  In fact, we did not even think twice about the cancellation and extension.  We enjoyed our stay, and we are looking forward to coming back. Next time, we will be staying at the Halekulani exclusively.","Date of stay: May 2009","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

From the moment one checks in to the moment of check-out, guests are regaled with countless services and gifts. 

My wife and I spent four nights here after vowing to return after 23 years. Although we were not in their data base (non-existent in those days), we were welcomed back. Much has remained the same. After swiping our credit card number, we were escorted to our ocean front room (our package included an upgrade and daily breakfast). Our first reaction was one of dismay, as the Sheraton Waikiki built its property to block a sizeable portion of the view. I cannot believe that the zoning commission would approve such intrusions. Fortunately, our views were indeed ocean front and we averted our glances from the monstrosity to our left. Moments after our cordial hostess left, a procession of gifts began, from fruit platters, to cheese platters, and even a large box of Hawaiian made cookies.  Of course those nightly little presents on the pillow still arrive. By the end of the first day, we indeed felt spoiled.

For breakfast, we had the choice of either the full buffet at the House Without A Key or the American Breakfast (a set menu) at Orchids. Since the offering at Orchids was somewhat restrictive, we opted for the HWAK buffet and were rewarded by a lavish array of fruit, beverages, hot and cold dishes, including fish, and of course pastries. What most guests do not realize is that just about everything is made on the premises, including the pastries.

In fact, we availed ourselves of a behind the scenes tour of the hotel. Ten of us got the chance to see kitchen operations, floral assemblies, laundry facilities (amazing!), just to name a few. If you are interested in this tour, sign up with the concierge. It is offered only on Friday's. Oh yes. You will receive even more goodies and a couple of surprises that you need to experience for yourself! Our guide/escort was Auntie Melba, who at 80, is a virtual historian of Hawaiian culture. 

I also recommend the Wednesday night managers (there is more than one) cocktail reception, during which time the staff mix with their guests to ascertain any problems that might occur or simply to get to know their guests better. This is very similar to the reception given at the Four Seasons in Wailea, Maui. I do wish to commend Mr. Shimizu for his graciousness and humility in making us feel like honored guests.

Another perk at the Halekulani is the opportunity to visit several museums. And these are free to guests. Hopping on TheBus is a fascinating way to explore the city and to get to meet the locals. Unfortunately, one of the offerings--a night at the Honolulu Symphony--is no longer available as the city has withdrawn funds for the concerts. As of this writing, the Symphony is no more--at least for now. But do explore the Bishop Museum, the Museum of Contemporary Art, and the Academy of Art are all of which are worth exploring.

Upon checking out, many staff were truly concerned that our transport had not yet arrived. Even Mr. Shimizu made an appearance. I need to stress that we are very ordinary visitors and do not wear fancy clothes or accessorites. At the Halekulani, every guest is made to feel special. Now that is as it should be.","Date of stay: May 2010","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

This was my third trip to Hawaii in 18 months - am drawn back again and again by cerulean waters and the beach lifestyle.  Trips 1 and 2 were both to Maui.  Wanting to chop three hours off the travel time and $100 a night on the hotel stay, I decided to give Waikiki a chance.  Enter the Halekulani and a room rate deal.  

The reviews posted within the last year I can vouch for as being accurate.  This is a quiet and reserved hotel - don't expect a big and fancy outdoor lobby or big shopping at the hotel.  I arrived early in the day (noon) and my room was available for check in.  Customer service is outstanding and staff were polite and gracious.  Even the most junior of staff will greet you quietly as you walk in the public areas.  It was never intrusive or annoying.  My Diamond Head Ocean View room  was worth every dime - not only can you see Diamond Head and the ocean but can watch the surfers off of Kuhio Beach Park - from your bed.  This orientation also gives you a little privacy from other rooms that might be directly across from you in an Ocean View room.  See their website re a map of where the rooms are.  It is accurate.  What blocks most of the hotel's view of Diamond Head is the monster Sheraton next door.

This is a hotel for people that want privacy, peace and quiet.  If you're looking for a party scene or a great kids club, this is not the place.  Security personnel are present at key areas and learned who I was, which I found comforting as a solo traveler.  The pool is beautifully understated, temperature perfect.  Pool attendants I also found a little standoffish.  No matter - an afternoon in a lounge chair with Mai Tai makes all the bad in life go away. 

The room - I had a fairly long stay at six nights and grew to love the layout.  I wouldn't consider the white/taupe decor necessarily dated - it's just understated and calming.  Spa-like.  (If the Hawaiian brights are your thing, the Royal Hawaiian is for you.)  Small bar area and mini fridge in the entry hall were used constantly.  The bathroom with one sink might be a problem for a couple but I found it super functional with the built in wall shelves for storage, and ample counter space.  It was very handy having the closet accessible from the bathroom AND the bedroom.   It was nice to have a small couch and chair, and I sat at the desk often.  Mostly I enjoyed the balcony which held two chairs, a table, a lounge chair and small side table.  Six days here was not claustraphobic.  Housekeeping was flawless.  As a rule I don't like turn down service but found a little gift left on my doornob the next morning along with the paper.  This turned out to be a nightly treat.  I started looking forward to what the gift would be each day.

The location is AWESOME.  I shopped more than one day - I liked Waikiki Beach Walk the best which dead ends at the Halekulani.  If that's not enough for you - Luxury Row (Louis Vuitton / Prada / Cartier) is across the street from the Walk.  GREAT restaurants at the Beach Walk.  A mellow and sophisticated crowd.   An ABC Store directly across the street from the hotel that while it didn't look like much from the street, turned out to be a marriage between your favorite grocery/deli - and Target.  Jackpot!

What's not to love? Perfect location, friendly staff beatiful grounds, great views and delicious food. So relaxing to sit out on your lanai and watch the ocean. 

The only downsides I can think of:
No jacuzzi in the pool area
The cane furniture is a bit dated (but hey, it's Hawaii, a tropical paradise!)

The bathrooms are elegant and clean, as are the rooms themselves. Great business centre with free internet access.

I wouldn't hesitate in recommending the Halekulani to anyone!","Date of stay: November 2009","Trip type: Traveled on business","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Very private with amazing views.  The suite is a great size with one and half bathrooms, large lounge area and huge bedroom.  We also had a huge lanai that ran the entire lenth of both rooms and sitting on it yhou felt like you were actually on the beach.

As the previous reviewer has already mentioned, our main issue with the suite is that there is no real wall between the loungeroom and the bedropom - it is all louvres which meant that although we booked a suite so the babies could sleep in a different room from us this isnt really what happened.  When I asked management about this I discovered that they dont actually have any rooms with real walls between the rooms.  I suspect some of the toip suites might but I didnt specificlally ask about this.  My only other minor comment is that although the room is lovely it is a bit tired and could do with an update.  That said, it is still a beautiful room in a beautiful hotel.

We tried both Orchids and House without a Key and both were good but if dining at House without a key get a table outside as the inside really has no atmosphere at all.  We also had room service and while the food was wonderfula nd it was beautifully presented, as an Australian we were a little shocked to see that 17% gratuity is included as is a $3 delivery charge.  We are used to having to tip in the US but does one have to tip on top of all of this?  We did (didnt want to be rude if it was still expected) but it did seem excessive. 

Again as per  the previous review, the location of the Halekulani is perfect.  Just a very stroll to all the chaos of the shopping etc but just far enough away that you feel like you are in your own private paradise.

Finally the staff was brilliant  Everyone )apart from one or two waiters at HWK who were a bit distracted) was very kind and helpful and abovfe all they all looked happy.  Happy staff makes for happy clients!","Date of stay: March 2010","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Then, we were on our honeymoon. This time we had a small child and two grandmas in tow! We had changed, but the Halekulani remained just as we remembered it: elegant, tranquil, and welcoming. 

We booked a suite, with an adjoining room for the grandmas. The suite was enormous; the bathroom had two sinks and a huge walk-in closet, as well as a separate WC and shower. The living area of the suite contained a sofa, chairs, a desk, a dining table and a wet bar area, as well as its own lanai. There was also an entry way with its own bathroom (with a Toto washlet!)  The grandmas' room was a regular room, with sofa, beds, bathroom, and lanai. When we booked we asked for a mini-fridge to keep baby food cold and were told that they did not have mini fridges available, but when we arrived and the porter saw that we were going to try to store food in the mini-bar, he magically produced a mini-fridge from who knows where! They also provided a high chair and a crib, tho' we did not end up using the latter as we had brought a portable crib with us. The rooms were lovely; I only have have two slightly negative comments that I offer more in the spirit of providing information than in complaint: we had asked for a suite specifically because we wanted to be able to relax in the living room while the baby slept. As it turned out, the wall between the bedroom and living room wasn't really a wall at all: it was made of wooden jalousie style slats, so privacy was somewhat compromised, and noise carried. Luckily, the closet/bathroom area was so large that the baby slept in there! Next, when we booked the single room we asked for twin beds; upon arrival we found that while the room did have twin beds they had pushed together. The size of the room meant that we were only able to separate the beds by about five inches. In this case, that was enough, but others might find the distance not far enough. Otherwise, we were very happy with the accommodations. 

The rest of the hotel was as gorgeous as we remembered. We had a package that included the breakfast buffet at the House on the Key, which we really enjoyed. The buffet was generous and contained both Western and Japanese dishes; everything was hot and delicious. The pool was lovely--tho' it closes at 6 p.m., which seems rather early to me. At this time of year it wasn't even dark by then. One of the attendants told us that this is because it is too dangerous for people to swim when it's dark out. But it wasn't dark out! And the pool is well lit. So, it seemed to me that the answer was more likely that the hotel wants people to switch into cocktail mode in the evening and that people still swimming would detract from that. Maybe so. Still, it would have been nice if the pool was open a bit later. In my experience most hotel pools are open until at least 8. But then, most hotel pools are not the centerpiece of the hotel, either. 

Among the many things that sets the Halekulani apart from the other Honolulu hotels is that it is somewhat off the beaten path,  so it's very quiet and tranquil, and yet all of Waikiki is just a few steps away. Another thing is that it's a grown-up hotel, and by this I don't mean that it isn't child friendly (on the contrary, they were very kind to our little boy,) but that people are expected to behave like grown-ups. There is no wild partying, no loud music, no people wandering into the restaurants in bathing suits. After the frantic pace of the rest of Waikiki, this is very soothing.

Others have commented that perhaps some aspects of the hotel are slipping a bit. It's true that the spa is small, but I found it to be more than adequate. The appointments in the bathrooms are nice, but not fancy by luxury hotel standards. But really, these are all just quibbles. The Halekulani is an old style hotel, a throwback to a more gracious and elegant time. The setting is gorgeous, the staff is friendly, and I can't wait to return.

Not up to Four Seasons but charges Four Seasons rates.","We stayed three nights and four days here.  A nice hotel, but for the prices charged, it could ...and should ... be much better.
Positives:
(1) Excellent concierge services.  Wendy and Susan were great.  
(2) Spectacular views.
(3) Excellent food at Orchids and nice breakfast at House Without a Key.
(4) Very clean.
(5) Friendly staff (by-and-large).

Negatives:
(1) Public facilities like spa and gym need to be expanded and modernized.  Gym equipment laughably old and poor.  In essence, the gym was a renovated hotel room.  Needs to be modern and larger for a hotel this size.
(2) Spa way too small.  Outdoor spa facilities face pool.  Need to be much more private.  Spa treatments grossly overpriced for what they are.  We don't mind paying ...and have paid at Four Seasons ... for inordinately better treatments for a lower cost.
(3) Rooms need modernization.  Bathrooms only have one sink and showers and tubs are small.  Stains in rug.  Furniture needs updating, though mattresses were quite comfortable.
(4) Check-in service inefficient,  We were told we ""would have to wait"" while two somewhat lazy staff members talked between themselves.
(5) Staff could take a Four Seasons lesson.  You NEVER vacuum the main rug in entry vestibule during the day.  Do it at night when no one is around (except, of course, if there is a major spill, etc.)
(6) Constant weddings interferred with guests' enjoyment and tranquility.  The Halekulani needs to decide whether it wants to be a banquet hall for foreigners who fly to the U.S. to save money, OR a five-star hotel, in the Four Seasons vein, that really caters to its guest as it did 25 years ago.
(7) Pool attendants, as a previous poster noted, are rude.  They continue to harass guests asking ""Are you a  hotel guest?"" We understand that they are on the main beachwalk at Waikiki, but two things: (a) they should know their guests, and (b) if there is a security issue with non-guest useage of the pool facilities, their security department needs to determine a solution that doesn't include insulting guests.

Generally, a very pleasant stay.  We'd like to see the Halekulani in the Four Seasons catgeory.  It used to be, but is no longer.  The potential is surely there, but they need to act and act quickly rather than rest on a former reputation that seems to be quickly eroding. Do not agree with Travel & Leisure that this hotel is the best in Hawaii.  For us, that honor is held by the Four Seasons on the Big Island.","Date of stay: February 2010","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Therefore, we stayed at the Halikulani for the first time. We had drinks and diner there before but never stayed at the hotel because of the very limited and extremely public beach, which is still a negative for us. But, the Halikulani won us over. While the location is in the center of Waikiki, it is still an oasis where one can relax. The location is fantastic, views are what you expect when going to Hawaii, the staff was overall very accommodating, the rooms are well maintained and while a little bit old fashioned, it still worked. Bathroom is spacious and you have all the amenities and nice fluffy towels. The pool area is sufficient with enough lounge chairs (important and a challenge in many hotels on the islands!). The spa is nice, while a little bit on the expensive side but the treatment was very good.  We did not try Orchids this time but I know it was good in the past and we really like the House without a Key. Also, on the other side of the street is Nobu, which is working with the Halikulani and we enjoyed the diner so much, that we went back twice. The hotel was busy with weddings, which were too much at times and the staff was very apologetic for any disturbances. 
Overall, I am glad we tried the Halikulani this time and our stay was great. We will return next year.","Date of stay: December 2009","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Quite possibly.","The Halekulani stood up to our expectations and then went way past them. It is such a beautiful place, spacious and full of colonial elegance. A haven without which our trip to Waikiki Beach might have been disappointing. 

More impressive than anything else was the service. I've never know anything like it and I'd love to know how they recruit and keep such a brilliant staff. Without exception every member of staff we met from the handy man to the concierge was friendly and interested and bloody good at their jobs. Great service but without deference.

The food at the Halekulani was delicious. We had a great meal at Orchids and a very pleasing afternoon tea as the Terrace. Most amazing though was La Mer, their star restaurant which we visited on our last night in Hawaii. I can't say enough about the ambience, the food and again the service... and actually the value as well. Go. You won't regret it. 

We would consider visiting Waikiki Beach again - purely for another stay at the Halekulani!

I read earlier the some reviewers were complaining the rooms seem outdated and needed to be redone and give the rooms a fresher look,I agree.
We had one small incident on Christmas day ,We had booked a table 1 month in advance for the Christmas day buffet and to our dismay we were given a table at the annex room with another Hawaiian family that consisted of 30! We were the only guest given a terrible table facing the back portion of Orchids.We came from so far away(France) to celebrate Christmas day and so we complained and they said flat out no ,no chance to get anything as they were booked solid.I would not have made a fuss if I saw 10 other hotel guest in the same situation but it was just my family and in the next table was a party of 30 .It was like we were put in a private function room where a family was celebrating Christmas and we looked like we were gatecrashers! I immediately asked to speak to the Manager and he was more than sorry and really tried his best to transfer usto a better table but he could not do anything himself and so he was so gracious to invite us to dinner at the Orchids on another night and we were given the best table in the restaurant and the dinner was compliments of the Manager.The funny part was, the buffet during Christmas was terrible!!! The turkey was cold and dry,all the other food seem to be sitting in the chaffing dish for hours and desserts were just Ok and the sushi was not even the good selection but rather very ordinary.We felt so bad that we decided the following sunday we would try the Kahala resort sunday buffet brunch and when we arrived we were given a booth table with the ocean view,the buffet was lobster,rack of lamb,fresh sushi,king alaskan crabs and more ,the buffet was not really a buffet beacuse everything was cooked only when you asked for it and was cooked at an open kitchen and was brought to your table so everything was newly cooked and still hot and not reheated in a chaffing dish .Pasta and dishes like tempura were cooked infront of you  and the best part was it was much more inexpensive than Halekulani....the resort even had us picked up by their shuttle and take us back.So for all those people who were told that the brunch buffet at Halekulani is the best ,may I warn you that this is not true.I live in Paris and took up a 4 year cooking course at the Ritz and Lenotre and I was so impressed with the food and service at Hoku at the Kahala.
Halekulani is a great resort and very chic and quiet ,do not expect a lively bar and a big lobby not a place for the young trendy set who enjoy martinis after dinner ,this Hotel is very discreet and very personalized .I love the Hawaiian music at the house without a key and the beautiful chic all white decoration that hotel is done in ,the Christmas decoration was stunning.The service was perfect and we never had problems when we asked for anything,we even rented a car to go around the island and we were given water and towels.I would definitely go back but next time I will not chose a time like Christmas or New years eve,I know even in the best places in the world on this particular day of celebration it is always impossible.","Date of stay: December 2009","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The hotel and grounds are stunning, and our room was beautiful with a large balcony and superb views of the Pacific ocean.  We also had champagne delivered to our room as a congraulatory gift.
There are many lovely touches to make your stay special and the staff are extremely polite and helpful.  We ate in the House Without A Key on a couple of occassions and also enjoyed watching the live music there a few times in the evening.
The hotel is really well placed to enjoy all the sights and sounds of Wakkiki Beach.  Talk to concierge if you want to go to Pearl Harbour - they can organise a shuttle bus which charges $15 each return, which is much cheaper than a taxi (the local buses take a long time, not great in the heat).
It's hard to find fault with this hotel but some guests might not like the fact that there is a dress code in the evening (i.e. no beachwear)  Also the hotel and pool area tend to be low-key so it's not the place to go if you want a party atmosphere!
Yes it's expensive but if you have the money, or if it's a special occasion, it's well worth it for the fantastic experience.","Date of stay: December 2009","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Pro's:  Peaceful location.  Atmosphere (perhaps very intentionally) relaxing and tranquil.  Staff members always make eye contact and offer a warm (and sincere) greating, regardless of their position at the hotel.  Concierge service is without a flaw.  Liked the sincerety.  Food and beverage service is dialed-in and gets a full five stars.  Ate all but two meals on-property.  Pool, grounds, lobby, business center and fitness room are kept spotless.  There is no charge to check email, news or print airline boarding passes in the [attended] business center. Guests do keep to themselves as other reviews noted. Last ""pro"" to mention: Mai Tai's at the pool!  Welcome relief after spending entire day indoors with business colleagues.

Con's: Postage-stamp (10 sq meters?) beach area. But, walk down to another hotel or the public beach areas, just a few hundred meters away.  It is very pricey, but you know that when booking a five-star location. Hotel hosts frequent weddings.  Though wedding parties are small, there was frequent activity setting up and taking down various spaces for ceremonies -- though, the Royal Hawaiian down the beach seems to host as many weddings as a Vegas chapel!  ha!

If you want to be away from traffic, resort area noise, stress and free-range, screaming children, the Halekuni has a LOT to offer.  If you want nightlife and someone else to entertain you, another property/location would be more appropriate.  I paid extra for these few days of quiet and the very attentive service.  It's just my preference to seek out entertainment and nightlife when I want to and not to have it keep me up all night when I don't.","Date of stay: October 2009","Trip type: Traveled on business","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Having arrived after 24 hours of travelling from the UK, the hotel was the nicest surprise and we were promptly given a bottle of champagne when we mentioned we were getting married whilst staying there. All of the staff were friendly, always smiling and saying 'aloha'.  We stayed in a garden court yard view which I was a bit apprehensive at first but the room and lanai were both very spacious and more than compensated for this a long with the fact that we didn't spend much time in the room as we were always out or by the pool.  The room itself was very nice, a huge bathroom with seperate shower as well as a shower over the bath (both very powerful) and nice sized wardrobes. 

We had a sitting area and large flat screen TV and the most comfiest bed. The room maids were very pleasant and if we left an extra dollar as a tip we were always guaranteed extra water and all of our requests were met. 

My husband had asked the concierge to arrange something special for our wedding day and we came back to the room with heart shaped petals on the bed and a trail of petals leading to the bath tub along with a bottle of champagne.  Having our wedding lunch on our lanai was pure elegance and the most enjoyaboe experience, the set up was just perfect. 

In terms of location, the Halekulani is positioned perfectly, away from the hustle and bustle of the main shopping area but just across the road was Lewers Street which had a number of bars and restaurant options as well as shops. 

We dined at Orchids on our wedding night which was a highlight of our stay, the food was excellent and waiters were very friendly. House Without a Key was my favourite place to dine and have an evening meal, the entertainment provided was always very good and the cocktails simply superb and we felt it was good value for money. 

The pool was large and never overcrowded and we always got great seats by the pool. The fridge in our room saved us having to eat out for breakfast as we brought cerals and milk and fresh fruit from the local ABC shops (of which there are many). In the evenings each turndown service we were always left a little gift which are now keepsakes and wonderful reminders of our time at the hotel.

Overall, Halekulani is more than worthy of its name 'house befitting heaven' and is a very hard place to leave. It wasn't the cheapest hotel but it was of a very high standard and definitley worth the extra we paid to stay on the best hotel on Oahu.  A place we will surely visit and hopefully very soon.","Date of stay: September 2009","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

To our surprise, we are one of a handful of American couples there. The menus heavily reflect Japanese cuisine. Even the light switches in the rooms were at a height for those shorter in stature. Place was way too pricey for their aging structures. Pool has not changed in over twenty years. The fitness room consisted of old, squeaky equipment. We would have paid somebody to remove this equipment from our home if it ever landed in our basement. We feel the lack of attention to the fitness room is because Japanese almost never work out as a rule. The few American guests used this room almost exclusively. Overall a very expensive disappointment.

I cannot say enough positive things about this hotel; the service was incredible, as were the accommodations and food. All of the lights in the room are controlled by a small panel with buttons on the bedside table. There is a button you press to have a red light outside your door for ‘do not disturb,’ and a green light if you are stepping out indicates ‘please clean our room.’ Any time we ordered room service or anything else requiring someone to come to our room, a staff member was there within minutes.  The rooms themselves are very clean, modern, and elegant, with fantastic views and huge bathrooms. The pool area was never full, and a beach lounger could always be found in prime sun or under an umbrella. The section of Waikiki Beach in front of the hotel is perfect for swimming, with gorgeous water and smaller waves than those found on other parts of the island. Food and drink service by the pool is excellent, and the staff is very friendly.  The Halekulani is located only about a block away from Chanel, Dior, and other upscale shops, and is only a few minutes cab ride from the Ala Moana mall. As far as food goes, the breakfast buffet at the House Without a Key was incredible, as was the ala carte breakfast menu at Orchids. We had one dinner at La Mer, and though it was quite pricey, it was one of the best dinners we have ever had. Also, Doraku Sushi (sp?), which is about 2 block away from the hotel, had absolutely incredible sushi. 
In short, we will absolutely be staying at the Halikulani on our next trip to Honolulu.","Date of stay: September 2009","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Amidst all of the hustle and bustle of Waikiki, the Halekulani stands as an oasis of peace, calm, and tranquility.  It really is a sublime experience - the very definition of great service.
I love the location - you can walk to all the shopping and dining options in Waikiki, yet still enjoy the peace and quiet of the Hotel when you want it.  With the redo of the Beachwalk area, it really is the perfect location to call home for a wonderful vacation.
The rooms are very nice.  All furnished in calming shades of whites and blues.  The beds are comfortable.  With the recent renovation, all rooms now have LCD TV's.  I don't go to Hawaii to stay in the room and watch TV, so these things are not as important to me.  Great bathrooms with separate tub and shower (love the showers by the way - super great pressure).  Lots of nice amenities including shampoo, conditioner, lotion, sunscreen, emery boards, robes, makeup mirrors, and more are in all rooms.  We had an oceanview room which offered spectacular vieww of the ocean and beach.  Lanai is very nice sized with plenty of room to enjoy cocktails etc.
We enjoyed all the restaurants on property with the exception of La Mer (next time!).  The mai-tai's at House without a Key are the best in Hawaii - and I've tried many of them.  Sitting at HWAK at sunset, enjoying the hula dancer and sipping on a mai-tai, is one of life's most enjoyable experiences - and not to be missed. We enjoyed breakfast, lunch, and dinner at HWAK and loved every meal.  Ok - this will sound odd, but I love the spaghetti there.  I never order spagehetti, but for some reason it really is delicious here.  For lunch, the saimen and the Joy's Special sandwich are both excellent.
I've reviewed Orchids separately - it's fantastic,
Lewers Lounge is the best for an after dinner drink.
The spa is great - pricey for sure, but the treatments are wonderful.  I just wish the spa offered its own pool or relaxation area (besides the patio they offer).
The service throughout the Hotel is near to perfect.  Your name is remembered wherever you go.  There are thoughtful touches that appear during your stay (including those wonderful chocolates in the room).  The staff in the Boutique is terrific - they remember the newspapers you want, what you bought earlier in your stay, and are just plain friendly.  
Many people noted the lack of the beach right in front of the Hotel.  To me, it's a non-issue.  If you want the beach you can enjoy the small beach in front or literally take a two minute walk to the huge portion of Waikiki beach.  Sure, it would be great it the Hotel had a bigger beach area, but it certainly is not a reason not to stay.
I find the atmosphere at Halekulani to be country club-ish.  Although I don't belong to a country club, I imagine that this is what it would feel like: comfortable, treated as an important individual, recognized, and warmly appreciated.
It's not an inexpensive place to stay, but gosh, its worth the money!","Date of stay: December 2008","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We were upgraded to a Junior Ocean Suite on arrival and personally escorted to our room where our luggage was already delivered. The view from the lanai overlooking Waikiki is something my wife and I will never forget. Simply fantastic. The suite was very roomy. Nice touches like a very large flat screen TV and iPod connection were great. Our suite had two lanai's; one overlooking the ocean and the other overlooking the pool and garden areas. Again, very nice. The bathroom was very spacious and very well appointed. As we arrived later in the evening (around 8pm) on a long direct flight from NJ we skipped dinner and decided to have drinks and appetizers at the Orchids which is an open air restaurant that has nightly Hawaiian entertainment. The service was fantastic. We stayed in Oahu and at the Halekulani for 2 nights and we both wished we could have stayed longer. We had been advised to limit our stay in Oahu and to stay longer in Maui and Kauai. That turned out to be the right decision (even though the Halekulani was great). We toured Pearl Harbor and our tour on Sept. 2nd coincided with the anniversary of the signing of the surrender documents on the US Missouri.

This is a true 5 star hotel with great service. The location is fantastic and right in the middle of the beach and shopping areas. Pool service was wonderful and I was able to also swim in Waikiki Bay. This hotel pretty much set the standard and was a wonderful beginning to our Hawaiian trip. We celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary and 2 bottles of champagne were delivered to our room on successive nights. For the second night I had the concierge make a dinner reservation at Ruth Chris. At the restaurant they were obviously told about our wedding anniversary and did some special things that really personalized our dinner. Kudos to the Halekulani and their wonderful concierge staff. We would definitely come back to this hotel.

As I mentioned this was the first hotel on a three island/hotel stay. The Halekulani at Oahu was first, followed by the Four Seasons at Maui and the Grant Hyatt at Kauai.","Date of stay: September 2009","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

It's the little touches like this that continue to make Halekulani a five-star resort.

We chose the Halekulani and we're so happy we did.  I understand that some guests might have been unsatisfied with the beach area, furniture, or fitness center.  The beach area is small, but if you want a bigger beach, just stroll over to the beach right next door.  I don't get what the problem was with the room furniture.  Our room was gorgeous and immaculate.  We had a gorgeous ocean view and were welcomed to delicious fresh fruit and chocolates in our room when we arrived.  The criticism of the fitness center is undeserved in my opinion.  There were always machines and weights available, the ellipticals and treadmills equipped with personal televisions overlooked the pool and beach, and a wealth of clean towels complimentary water, apples and bananas were always provided.  I never had a problem getting a lounge chair at the pool at any time during the day.  The service at the Halekulani hotel was impeccable.  The receptionist who checked us in personally escorted us to our room to make sure we were satisfied with its view and condition.  Our bags were immediately brought to us and we were asked where we would prefer to have them placed.  The concierge staff was exemplary, especially Mark and Theresa.  Their attention to detail, professionalism and friendly demeanor made our stay all the more wonderful.  Everyday, upon returning from one of our many activities, we were greeted with a special treat left by the housekeeping staff.  During a conversation with our receptionist, she asked if we were celebrating an anniversary or honeymoon, and although this vacation was not to celebrate our anniversary it just happened to be in two weeks.  One afternoon we were greeted with a complimentary bottle of champagne, 2 champagne glasses and a card wishing us a Happy Anniversary.  These are just some of the marvelous aspects of this hotel and there were many more, the gorgeous decor, it's location, great shopping within walking distance and although surrounded by other hotels, still felt private, oh and the incredible food...especially the breakfast buffet.  As you can see, I can go on and on but the point is if you choose this hotel, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!","Date of stay: August 2009","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We did have a beautiful view from the ocean-front room, but the room was pretty small, the outdoor furniture was not very nice, and we were surprised by the lack of amenities (like a coffee maker) in the room. We also found the pool to be somewhat small and there were very few cabanas - most of the pool chairs were just in the big green lawn near the pool. The private beach area is VERY small. We did enjoy our breakfasts in both of the breakfast locations, although the hotel did not have the information that we were supposed to get breakfast included and weren't very willing to help us out. Some of the concierge people were fantastic, although one came off as very snooty and unhelpful - we tried to avoid him and get help from others!

You have to be prepared for what it does and does not offer.  There really isn't a beach in front of the hotel.  There is a tiny strip of sand that mostly disappears during high tide.  But, there is a gorgeous pool with lots of lounge chairs.  We really liked the rooms and the way the bathroom connected to the bedroom by opening the closet (it sounds strange, but it gives the rooms a very open feel).  Also, liked the free wireless!
The staff were by and large very friendly (there were a few times when we felt it was a little pretentious).  The housekeepers, waiters, and concierge were especially personable and friendly.  
Some of the hotels' best features are its excellent dining options in house (loved House without a Key and Orchids), its location (right in the middle of Waikiki, yet you do feel like you are getting away from the hustle and bustle), and we loved the hotel's recommended surf school, the Ty Gurney surf school, located on the small patch of beach right in front of the hotel.  They are fantastic!  I would highly recommend learning to surf with them.  
Areas for improvement: More lounge chairs in the shade.  They were in very high demand and the chairs with umbrellas were gone early in the day!  There is a lovely lawn with trees, I would highly suggest planting more to get more shade and bringing in more umbrellas.
The pool is somewhat small for the size of the hotel.  And it is nearly impossible to do laps unless you do them very early in the morning because there are so many people in the pool.  Consider putting in a lap pool.
The fitness room is quite small.  It does have nice views, but it is much too small for the size of the hotel (3 treadmills, 2 elipticals, and 3 bikes).

The hotel is well located and with all the new cleanup of the area it is probably one of the best in-town locations to  visit  the shopping and resturants from. We stayed in an ocean front room and had great views of the pool and the ocean, Although we booked through amex platinum, and we usually get an upgrade to a suite, they claimed that the hotel was full and no upgrade  at this time. The room was still very nice; clean and well taken care of. Service was good. But i still have to wonder about this full hotel business!?! We keep reading about tourism beening down, etc so how do you fill hotels at $550+/night?! 
The pool and pool area and landcaping was well maintained and the service was good. One thing that really impressed is that as many of the guests area Japanese they have raised kids that are well behaved. It is just amazing to us to see and hear well behaved kids in the pool, restaurants, etc. No screaming or running and then we go to Hyatt in Kauaii (see review) and mostly all American kids and what a cifference!!!! So if you are a typical American family, with what you think area typical American loud and bratty kids my advise is to go elsewhere; and spare us!! 
The breakhast buffet was good, excellent omlet man! We ate in the restauants and none were memorable, but neither good nor bad.

The staff there was extremely obliging and accommodating.  The grounds are quite lovely and whole place is surprisingly serene considering it's in the middle of bustling Waikiki.  I have a few minor criticism: 1) the gym is small, although it has some decent aerobics equipment (but mediocre weight machines and no free weights).  2) the breakfast buffet at the open-air House Without Key was very tasty with good variety, but was plagued by aggressive birds, which knew no shame (or fear) in swooping down to share your plate of fruit or danish).  3) perhaps the most significant criticism is that this place is very expensive, although we got a decent deal through my Amex Platinum card that included free breakfast everyday and 1 free lunch, and free room upgrade.  The other thing to note (not a criticism, but surprising nonetheless) is that the majority of guests while we were there were Japanese (not Japanese-Americans), but that is generally true of much of Waikiki.","Date of stay: August 2009","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The service is impeccable- from the pool, the restaurants, the housekeeping, we were treated like royalty.  There were many special added touches, like providing a complimentary coffee station in the morning, popsicles by the pool in the afternoon,  free WiFi, little gifts every night, and a very helpful and friendly staff.  The location is excellent – it is quiet and peaceful, but also easy walking from all of activity of Waikiki.  We booked the least expensive room, but still had a fantastic ocean view.  I cannot imagine a bad room in this hotel.  
There are a few knocks on this resort, however.  The first one being the beach that the Halekulani sits on is probably the smallest part of Waikiki Beach.  The actual beach area in front of the hotel is hardly big enough for a handful of people, especially not at high tide.  Certainly you can walk a couple minutes in either direction and have larger beach, but the truth of the matter is that the beach in front of the Halekulani itself is poor.  The rooms, although impeccably clean, are a bit outdated- the furniture seemed a bit tired, and there was only a single sink in the bathroom, rather than dual sinks which we’ve come to expect at hotels of this caliber.  The gym is rather small, with only a few cardio machines, weight machines and free weights.  Our biggest complaint is that although our room had a large balcony and view of the ocean, we were directly above the ballroom.  As would be expected, many weddings and events took place on the premises, and the night before our early morning flight, there was a large party in the ballroom directly below our room.  The music was so loud, we could actually hear the lyrics of every song.  The music was promptly turned off at 10pm, so I do not think that it was unreasonable, but we were annoyed since we had to get up so early, and chose the Halekulani because we wanted to be AWAY from all of the noise.","Date of stay: July 2009","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

The rooms are simple, impeccable, comfortable, and the service is amazing. And the funny thing was that the staff actually looked like they loved working there, and you could see it.  maybe it was just being in Honolulu, or it was the Hotel...but everyone was so nice, enquiring about what we'd seen, giving us more tips. And my husband, who is very picky, rates Orchids, the restaurant in the hotel as having one of the best breakfasts ever. We were in Honolulu for 7 days, and we dined at the Orchids for 5 of them. True, our bill was pretty darn high and we paid those credit card bills over a couple of months, but it was so totally worth it.
I'd love to go there again. I don't even want to see the other Islands. Honolulu will do, as on as we're at the Halekulani.","Date of stay: September 2007","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I have nothing negative to say about my experience here.

From the time you arrive, you are treated GREAT! When we checked in, the woman actually walked us to our room, pointing out things along the way.  Our luggage arrived very shortly after we made it to our room.  We had a great view of Diamond Head from our balcony.

The restaurant there, The House without a Key was great, too! We ate there just as the sun was going down, and it was VERY pleasant and romantic.

Our room was very clean and beautiful! The bathroom was excellent!

I got my hair and makeup done at the spa for my wedding.  I wasn't too impressed with the makeup job, but the hair was good.

It deserved the 5 stars, but there really needs to be a different category for Halekulani. 5 stars isn't enough. This hotel really is in another league from anywhere else I have ever been.

We (25F/28M) stayed here after we were married on Oahu. Previous stay and wedding night was at the Marriott, like mentioned above, but then 5 nights at Halekulani after our family left.

Actually, our story of Halekulani begins on the wedding night, where we had made reservations at Orchids for our wedding dinner (party of 7). From the moment the limo dropped us in front we were treated like royalty. The valet guys are amazing and guided us to the restaurant. Of course we were in our wedding attire so we received many compliments and congratulations from the staff. When we got over to Orchids, we didn't even give them any information. They smiled, congratulated us, and immediately took us to our seats. It was a wonderful big table set up right by the ocean, and even though it was dark, it was so nice to hear the waves crashing. 

The food at Orchids is AMAZING. I'm more of a 'simple' eater but it's definitely fantastic. Beautifully presented and everyone loved what they got.

I will make one small complaint here. The service throughout the meal was wonderful but dropped off a little at the end. When they brought our check, it was all together (instead of broken out into our 'parties') and the guy went to fix it. It seemed like he disappeared forever and when he came back, it was broken up, but now the tickets were wrong. He disappeared again but finally got it fixed, we paid and left. It wasn't a huge deal, but we were exhausted and ready to go.

The next night we checked into Halekulani for our stay. Everyone there remembered us from the night before and were so friendly and pleasant. The valet guys took our bags and we went to check in.

Like others have mentioned we were immediatel taken to our room for checkin, and to my surprise, our bags were already waiting there for us, even after I remembered we didn't give them our name or room number or anything. I don't know how they do it, lol.

We were shown around the room, and pointed out items of interested, signed a few papers and that was it! Fruit and chocolates were waiting for us, as well as a chilled bottled of champagne with a personalized note to us, the newlyweds!

We were in awe of the room. After the staff had left, we were just walking around going ""honey, look at this!"", ""no, come look at this!"" - it was the most beautiful hotel room we had ever been in. We didn't have a fancy suite, just an ocean front, but it was huge. Very clean looking with lots of light/white colors.

The bed was unbelievably comfortable, with a bench at the end. There's a sitting area with love seat/table and also a writing table/chair. We stayed after the remodel was done so we had a great, big, flat panel TV. Next to the bed was a closet with a big sliding door and you could actually walk through the closet to get to the bathroom. 

The bathroom was amazing! It was SO BIG with a nice deep tub, seperate stand up shower, and toilet closed off in a room with a door by itself. The sink/vanity was gorgeous and with both closet doors opened, you could lay in the tub and look out at the ocean!

The room was stocked with anything we might need. Fridge, lots of big plump towels, 2 robes, 2 sets of slippers, all bathroom amenities, sewing kit, shoeshine, etc. Not to mention everything was labeled/embroidered with the Halekulani logo.

The entire atmosphere of the hotel was extremely romantic. Actually, we counted 6 bridal parties during our stay. It was quiet, relaxed, removed from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki. 

BUT, it was right in the middle of the action. Just walking a few steps and you're right there. In fact, one of our favorite hangouts ended up being the street right out from Halekulani, with lots of restaurants (Yardhouse!) and icecream (Mondo Gelato!) It's a great location. 

Sitting on our balcony and looking down at the singers and hula dancer at House Without a Key is one of the best memories we have. Nice breeze and relaxing live Hawaiian music right from the comfort of our own balcony.

We would love to be able to go back, however, this was our splurge vacation, since it was the wedding and all, and I'm sure we won't be able to afford to stay at Halekulani on our next visit, but we will walk past and smile and remember our fabulous 5 days there.

Do not hesitate to stay at Halekulani if you can. It's definitely worth it!","Date of stay: March 2009","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

My husband and I stayed at the Halekulani for 6 days (first part of our honeymoon) during the month of May. The hotel staff was terrific from the day we first arrived until the day we lelf, they treated us like celebrities. The hotel is extremely clean and have beautiful spacious rooms. We stayed in a front ocean room and it was just gorgeous with an excellent view!! The location is just great, right on the beach and near high end as well as local shops. Our package included breakfast (I will highly recommend) at either ""house without a key"" or ""orchids"" and the food was great. We ordered room service a couple of times and the service and food were terrific. It can get a little pricey, but they are various restaurants close by that are more affordable.
Entertainment is offered on the afternoons at the ""house without a key"". 
I loved the ice cream given to us every day at the pool, so delicious. Water, daily newspaper, special little souveniers left on our beds and fresh flowers for your hair were complementary and offered every day.  We were very impressed with this since the other hotel we stayed at (Grand Waleia) for the 2nd part of our honeymoon, charged you for everything (we were charged $4 for extra 2 rolls when ordering $80 of room service!!). 
What we enjoyed most about this hotel is the privacy and exclusivity. It is the perfect place for honeymooners. I can't wait to come back next year!!","Date of stay: May 2009","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

When we got in to the room we were welcomed with a fruit platter and chocolates.  Later that afternoon a bottle of champagne was delivered with a card congratulating us on our recent marriage.  Each night there was a little gift left on the pillow and it was so fun to come back to the room to see what was left!  The shower was fantastic, I don't know what they did to the pressure or water but I'd love to try to mimic that in our house!  The service at the pool was terrific, the breakfast at Orchids was AMAZING, dinner at La Mer was romantic and delicious with a TON of food.  House Without a Key has a great/varied menu and the food was delicious there as well.  The nightly entertainment on the patio was so relaxing and fun.  We LOVED the mojitos with crushed ice and drank many of them while relaxing by the pool.  It is centrally located in Waikiki, easy to walk to nearly anything in 10mins or less!

The grounds are simply gorgeous and the hotel is very tasteful. The service is superb! The rooms however need to be updated, they are nice and clean but certainly not the best - paint chipping in the bathroom, old cracked tiles, etc. There is a lot of new construction in Waikiki, especially around Halekulani and it's difficult to relax with the constant drilling and other construction noise around you all day long. Another unfortunate thing about this place (and somewhat unusual for a 5-star Hawaiian hotel) - it doesn't have a beach!

The Halekulani is a top of the line hotel with rooms that range from large guest rooms to 4066 sq. ft.  suites. This is the quintessential romantic hotel- great for honeymoons or anniversaries but not for children. The few children I saw were mostly new babies. 

Our view was amazing! We had an Ocean Front room with a large lanai with a gorgeous view of the pool and the ocean. There are also Diamond Head Suites available with a view of Diamond Head and you will have a gorgeous view of Diamond Head from the pool area regardless. I really enjoyed the clean white decor- breezy & light-  not tacky and overdone like a lot of five star hotels. The bathroom was large with a deep tub, separate shower and a separate commode room like in a home. The closet opened to the bedroom and on the bathroom side it had sliding mirror doors. I was happy that the bathroom had a seated vanity and a separate magnifying mirror. There were fresh flowers in the room, fresh fruit, a box of Halekulani chocolates [made on site] and the manager sent up a cold bottle of French champagne. I was truly impressed with the attention to detail from the staff during our entire stay. Everyone is treated like a celebrity and there were several American celebrities there during our stay. They have a hotel dress code and excellent security so you feel comfortable and safe. There are beautiful tropical plants and flowers throughout the hotel and they changed the huge foyer tropical flower display once while we were there.

We dined at all three of the Halekulani restaurants and loved them all. ""The House Without a Key"" is casual and breezy- lots of fresh fish & seafood- with live entertainment They have an amazing daily brunch with fresh fruit, vegetables, omelets made to order and American as well as Japanese dishes. [Hawaii is very popular with Japanese tourists and it seemed like 50% of the tourists in Waikiki were Japanese. I noticed that much was in English and Japanese- everywhere in Waikiki.] They have a middle of the line restaurant ""Orchids"" that also had an ocean view and excellent seafood. To me, the most impressive restaurant was ""La Mer""- Hawaii's only 5 star restaurant. They have tableside service, amazing ocean views [with the shutters open to the sea] in which each table is so private that you feel like the only ones in the restaurant. My husband ate things like steak, filet mignon of venison and roasted quail. He said his food was good but if you are a seafood/ fresh fish lover, you will be in heaven. Every dish I had in Hawaii was amazing. The desserts at Orchid and La Mer are fantastic as well. The House Without a Key's desserts were more plain but good. We dined at La Mer for Valentine's and they gave each lady a  perfect, long-stemmed, red rose with the thorns removed and a red bow. Of the three restaurants, ""House Without a Key"" is fairly inexpensive, Orchids is middle-of-the-line and La Mer is fine dining and you should expect a large bill. Our La Mer bill came to over $300 before the tip. I swear it was worth every penny! If you are a seafood/fresh fish ""fan"", this is the place for you.

Halekulani is walking distance to shopping including Luxury Row and other restaurants as well. We also enjoyed meals at Roy's [Hawaiian Fusion] and Hula Grill which had a beautiful ocean view. Both of these restaurants were inexpensive and once again... excellent fish & seafood! I could live in Hawaii! Halekulani was a short taxi ride to other destinations- like Diamond Head for example. The hotel behind the Halekulani has a bus station under it and there are bus day-trips to luaus. There are catamaran trips with snorkeling. So much to do!

It rained off & on two days during our stay- just sun showers- and the Halekulani provides complimentary umbrellas to all guests. I would've never thought to bring an umbrella and it was fantastic not to have to buy one then ditch it to fly home. There are several shops at the Halekulani as well. I spent a lot of time in the Halekulani Boutique. They sell the chocolates made by the hotel, specialty teas- Hawaiian Passion, Pineapple Tea & Halekulani Specialty Blend were my favorites. They have a lot of Halekulani items. You can also purchase their robes- like provided in the rooms. I shopped a lot in Hawaii and with the new flight restrictions on baggage, it was easier to mail everything home to myself. Halekulani took care of everything for me. My packages arrived the day after we were home.

I would highly recommend this hotel for couples and teens but it is more ""romance"" than ""family"" oriented. There were several Japanese weddings at the Halekulani on Valentine's Day. 

There is a Business Center with complimentary food, drinks, large screen TV, showers, lockers and computers with internet service. We were able to check-in online and print our return boarding passes before we went to the airport.

We were taken up to our room for check in, and that was followed by a bottle of champagne delivered to our room after they learned it was our anniversary.  The room was an ocean view, with a decent sized balcony, a large bedroom area, and a gorgeous bathroom.  The closet separates the bedroom area from the bathroom, but there are door on either side of it that open up so you can see the sunset from the jacuzzi tub or separate glass shower.  The restaurant by the pool area that is mostly outdoors (sorry I'm forgetting the name of it) is absolutely delicous.  Get the lemon grass beef skewers... I still have cravings!  The pool staff are more than happy to help you find lounges and put these super fluffy towel slip covers on for you.  The bar boys that make the rounds are really funny and can recommend some great drinks.  One of my favorite things about the hotel is the location.  It's right on Lewers Street, aka the Beachwalk, with lots of restaurants, shopping and bars (Yardhouse, PF Changs, Starbucks, Gelato, Baskin Robbins, Dennys, Roys, etc).  And the beach is protected on 1 side by the Sheraton and on the other by the Halekulani, so it's almost a private beach.  Pretty small but not crowded.  I would recommend to anyone!","Date of stay: September 2007","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The restaurants and pool are awesome.  The rooms are nice and clean but the walls are a bit thin and you can hear it every time a neighbor closes the closet shutters.

Great service and a very controlled environment (within the chaos that is Waikiki).  The hotel didn't let us down, our partial ocean view room was just what we would have asked for location wise.  It was spotless and ready when we arrived.  

Service was uniformly great, the staff here really have been drilled on their ""for you anything"" slogan.  We found this attitude to be present in every staff person - although it does become a bit tedious having really basic requests be treated as special service.  One example - the lunch menu by the pool includes neither burgers or hot dogs - now I realize this place is aiming to serve a certain type of guest with their lobster club sandwich but come on, pool eats are going to include burgers and fries are they not?  Naturally, all it took was a request to the server to produce a fantastic burger, but really isn't it going a bit far to leave it off the menu so that you can make a big deal out of getting you one a bit much?

These are small gripe indeed, generally service was great.  Staff was helpful.  And prices were not totally out of line with other nearby Waikiki hotels of lesser caliber.  I do highly suggest Orchids for breakfast (but not Sunday brunch) - service was great and the food was fantastic.

I booked this hotel through American Express and trusted that it would be 5-star quality. I also had high expectations given the price was the same as the Ritz-Carlton in Kapalua Maui (where we spent most of our honeymoon). It was definitely a nice hotel, but it did not meet my expectations based on price and star rating. It lacked that really plush and top of the line feeling you get at a Ritz Carlton or other top hotel. The pool area is small, but we were able to get chairs. The beach is extremely narrow so there isn't really any room for laying out. If they were to change their rating to 4-star and knock the price down about 20-30%, it may have met my expectations.

I was so nervous before we arrived as i had read the negative reviews on tripadvisor. We are incredibly fussy and we stayed for four nights over Christmas in two connecting deluxe diamond head view rooms and they were wonderful, no they are not ultra modern but they are very stylish and impecably clean. We had a huge flat screen tv in each room and incredibly comfortable beds, there was a desk in each room and a sofa and coffee table and ample storage space, lovely clean carpet that you didnt mind actually walking on. The bathrooms are not modern but they are large in a very smart traditional design and again very very clean with plenty of beautiful soft towels and lovely bathroom products. The staff were wonderful and we did not meet any of the aggresive security guards that people claim to have been questioned by and yet we didnt look anything special and were always walking around in very casual beach/holiday clothes and flip flops with abc plastic bags full of cans of drink for the room and snacks for the children, but we were always greeted with a smile! We loved having breakfast at orchids (sure its pricey but hey you are on holiday!) The one day i encouraged my family to eat breakfast at Dennys just across the street (my small attempt at dealing with the credit crunch!!) it was a disaster, we saved $40 but the food was hideous in comparrison and my hubby said it was worth $40 more just to have the view from Orchids let alone the quality of the food, so dont bother with that little penny pincher!! Cocktails in the evening at House without a Key is fabulous, some people are all dressed up but plenty of others are still in shorts and flip flops and everyone is served with a smile, its a lovely way to spend an evening. We were invited to the managers Christmas reception party and it was wonderful, the food was really incredible and the mistletoe cocktails were fantastic, my daughters were treated so kindly and staff rushed off to make them the virgin pina coladas they requested, nothing was too much trouble. We were also treated to a wonderful display of Hawaiian dancing and music by a group of women of all ages including young children it was truely wonderful and then of course we had a visit from Santa himself, it was a great party. We had lunch at Orchids on Christmas day (fabulous once we got our table, but there was a bit of a wait even though i had booked months in advance) still it was worth the wait and we had a delicious meal only ruined at the end because my 16 year old daughter realised that she had lost the Tiffany bracelet that she had got for christmas! she sobbed her heart out and my youngest daughter crawled around on the floor looking for it, we retraced our footsteps (she knew she had it earlier when we had been waiting for our table) Anyway we couldnt find it and to be honest it was a tiny thin chain with a small heart on it and i honestly didnt have any hope of finding it but the staff were wonderful, they hated seeing her so upset and they said they would keep looking for it when they cleared the room later in the day. She went back to her room and sobbed some more (bracelet was gift from boyfriend still at home in england so great sentimental value- Tiffany bracelet at 16 what is the world coming to! i got a new CD if i was lucky or a box of chocs) Anyway we got a phone call to the room and the wonderful staff had found the bracelet so it was a happy christmas in the end!! Anyway sorry i'm making this so long but i really cant say enough about this wonderful hotel and the fantastic staff. Because of our flight times back to the uk we spent another night at the end of our holiday (after a week on Maui) in Honolulu and there was no availability at the Halekulani so we booked two connecting diamond view rooms at the Moana Surfrider in the tower (suposedly their best rooms) and it did not compare, it was grubby, the towels were threadbare and the rooms were incredibly basic, the carpet was totally disgusting a filthy sticky mess that you didnt want your feet to touch YUCK!! The bath had stains running down the outside of it and there was a long black hair on the first towel i picked up, none of us have long black hair !! It was dirty and dated (apart from spaceage mutifunctioning toilet, honestly you need to see it to believe it or rather you need to use it to believe it!!) The Moana is not special enough for me, honestly if you like luxury then dont hesitate the Halekulani is the hotel to book, you wont be dissapointed, we the Fussy fussy fussy family from England absolutely loved it!!!!!!!!!","Date of stay: December 2008","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We stayed here for just under a week before going to California and we werent disappointed.
We booked it nearly a year before we got married and read some amazing reviews but also some disappointing ones, we then were slightly worried when we read that there would be some construction work happening. However there was but we didnt even notice and our stay was un-interrupted. The rooms I think have been slightly updated since some of the reviews I read as the did have flatscreen tvs etc so n o complaints from me, it was comfortable, clean and had all amenities we needed, and if there was something extra we wanted it was arranged by the concierge.
When we arrived the service was excellent and the check-in at your room whilst being shown all facilities etc was something we werent expecting. Within 20mins of being in ours room champagne, chocolates were sent up to us to celebrate our honeymoon.
I also loved the daily gift left for us at turn down. 
All hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful, most people calling us by name, for a large hotel this was nice.
Food in Hawaii everywhere I would say is relatively expensive and the Halekulani was no exception, but every meal we ate there was amazing! Orchids breakfast was gorgeous with attentive service, we had dinner at La Mer on the Sat which we thoroughly enjoyed with great wine recommendations by the waiter.
The concierge even let me have some orchids to put in my hair to wear to La Mer as they matched my dress perfectly!
We used the Spa on day 1 which was fantastic, great start to a relaxing holiday, a custom massage was bliss!
When we were there there was very heavy rain/storm for 2 days and the staff were very helpful at suggesting what we could do/ where we could go when we decided to cancel our day trip to Maui. The concierge organised some day trips for us to Hanaiema Bay and Pearl Harbor which was great
The pool was fabulous, we were there beginning of Dec so was really quiet, great service here too. The beach is very small outside the hotel but there are plenty of other spots you can go to if you just want to lie on the beach.
The weather was the only let down for us while we were there but thanks to the staff and gorgeous hotel we thoroughly enjoyed it and have really fond memories of our stay in Oahu and the start to our married life.","Date of stay: December 2008","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

If you're looking for a great hotel in the middle of Waikiki, this is it.  But if you're expecting quiet and some degree of solitude, you'll be disappointed.  The Halekulani isn't as big as some other Waikiki beachfront hotels, but it is a very crowded and bustling place.  It has become somewhat of a trendy spot for weddings and receptions and, in fact, there were at least five weddings going on during both of the days we stayed here.  Bridal parties were literally bumping into each other in the hallways and breezeways and bridal couples were often waiting their turn to be photographed in various spots around the property.

Having said that, I highly recommend the Halekulani for being an extremely well run luxury resort hotel.  The front desk staff is efficient and supremely polite.  (On our return to the hotel from Maui, all of Oahu had been blacked out by an island-wide power failure following a lightning storm.  Despite the extreme stress the staff was under, they really handled it with grace and a positive sense of helpfulness. I was very impressed by that.)  Other reviewers have mentioned how the check-in process is actually done in the privacy of your own room, which is a nice touch.

Our rooms were both large, comfortable and modern.  The bathrooms were also large, well appointed and spotless. There's a nice feature of being able to slide open a glass door from the bathroom that allows you to actually see through your closet and outside!   The views of Diamond Head from our lanais (decks) were stunning, but the decks are quite close to each other and you can see other decks above and below you quite easily so they are not as private as they could be.  BEWARE: even with an ocean front room, you do hear a lot of noise from the streets in front of the hotel.  We heard traffic noises, horns, sirens, and garbage truck pickups all night (along with the ocean waves). Another warning: if you eat on your balcony prepare to be attacked by birds which can also leave some messes on your balcony.          

Service: 5 Stars everywhere but the pool.  Service there was almost non-existent and a little snooty.  

Pool: quite nice but open surprisingly limited hours. Why close the pool at 6pm?   Also, because there are so many people staying here now and the pool is a popular place,  there is an almost comical early-morning swarm of guests trying to stake out their pool chairs. When you have big wedding parties and big groups of people, I watched in horror from our 12th floor balcony as an army of invaders literally took over the entire pool deck area in a matter of moments.  Also, maybe the Halekulani could take a stand and ban cell phone use at pools. When I come to Hawaii, I don't enjoy hearing dozens of ring tones and phone conversations.  Hotel Management: take a stand and ban cellphones at the pool!    

Food: I have eaten at La Mer on a previous stay and it was exceptional. Halekulani recently changed chefs but I know it is still great, but seriously expensive to eat there. We enjoyed several meals at House Without a Key.  There is a terrific Sunday brunch there, too.  One small complaint I had is that, on our first night's stay  I noticed some pieces of broken glass near the performers stage at House Without a Key and pointed it out to a waitress.  Six nights later when we returned to the hotel for our last night before flying home, those same pieces of glass were still there. I found this a little surprising in light of the rest of the hotel's army of efficient housekeeping, maid service, and ground crew staff members.

Nightly entertainment: I really enjoyed the trios of musicians who played (Sunset Serenaders) as well as the well-done hula dances done by former Miss Hawaii.  They both had a real aura of authenticity to them.

The beach: it is very, very small.  Waikiki is not a wide beach, and the area of sand in front of the Halekulani is postage-stamp size.

The grounds: spotless and beautifully maintained.

All in all: the Halekulani is a first rate hotel.  It is incredibly expensive but that should come as no surprise because of its location and reputation.  Because it is so popular, it has become extremely crowded but I can definitely think of worse places to stay on Waikiki.","Date of stay: December 2008","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We have seen many recent negative reviews of this hotel, so we wanted to give you a sense of our opinion.  To give you a sense of where we normally stay (to show you our typical hotel expectations), we have been to Hawaii multiple times and, prior to this trip, we stayed at the Marriott Ko Olina, Four Seasons Hualalai, Four Seasons Maui, Hilton Hawaiian Village, Fairmont Orchid, Hilton Waikoloa and the Halekulani.    We usually stay in the cheapest room at these hotels, but in Honolulu, we avoid city-view rooms due to noise concerns.  When we travel to places other than Hawaii, we normally stay anywhere from 2 to 4 star hotels – anything from a Courtyard Marriott to a full-service Marriott or Westin property.  

To enjoy the Halekulani, I think you have to adjust your expectations from those you would have when going to a high-end “resort” property (Four Seasons Hualalai or Four Seasons Maui) to those you would have at a high-end “hotel” property in a big city.  The Halekulani is like the Four Seasons or Mandarin Oriental in downtown Miami.  The Halekulani is an “oasis” inside of the very busy and hectic Waikiki area, as long as you view the water and not the street from your room – I would NOT come here if your room faces the street.  Here is what I thought about the hotel by relevant category:

Service:  The service is exceptional in almost every area, even compared to the service at the Four Seasons Maui.  The check-in process is completed in your room; the hotel calls you on your cell phone when your room is ready for check-in; and the concierge staff will promptly fulfill requests.  While we were there, to celebrate the December holidays, the hotel prepared complementary Hawaiian shaved ice (sno-cones) for guests at the pool, provided complementary limousine service to the local mall and provided trolley tours of the holiday decorations in Honolulu on Christmas Eve.  The hotel acknowledged a special occasion for us with complementary champagne, wine, flowers, etc., and the hotel provides every guest with fresh fruit, handmade chocolates and cold water bottles in the room.  

Location:  The bottom line is that if you want to be in the hectic Waikiki area, this is the best, most serene place to stay.  Waikiki is loud and very crowded.  The beach in Waikiki is extremely crowded and I would not enjoy swimming in the ocean at Waikiki (try Lanikai Beach for a great Oahu beach – both to view and for swimming).  Once you enter the Halekulani, the serene courtyard and (relatively speaking) quiet, serene pool is very relaxing (as compared to the pools at the Sheraton Waikiki or at the Hilton Hawaiian Village, for instance, where the chairs are on top of each other).  If you cannot stand noise, need a large/spread-out beach and need a lot of space, my recommendation would be to avoid Waikiki (maybe avoid Oahu completely) and head to a more serene area.  If you go to Halekulani, you get all the people-watching/noise/excitement/crowds of Waikiki but also get an “oasis” to return to – but you will never get the complete serenity or beautiful beaches present in Wailea on Maui or the Kohala Coast on the Big Island.  

Rooms:  The rooms could be improved.  The rooms are at least 10-20 years old, but they are very comfortable.  The Jacuzzi tub is small for such a luxury hotel, and the separate glass shower is small, but both are very comfortable.  The lanais are very large, and with an oceanview or Diamond Head oceanview room, you can truly enjoy the lanai – it is large enough to use for all your meals or to enjoy an evening cocktail.  (Please note that the lanais are very close to each other - no privacy.)  The televisions have just been replaced but have horrible reception (I do not really care - who comes to Hawaii to watch television?).  With prices increasing 5%-10% per year, I would expect a major room renovation in the near future, but I would not let the room’s age stop you from coming to the Halekulani, at least for the next year or two.  As I mentioned above, we viewed the ocean, and the view was extremely relaxing.  Based on the very loud street noise I heard inside the hotel when looking out an interior window viewing the street, I would not stay here in a city-view room.  Though the room rates are lower for city-view rooms, I would be very annoyed by the noise.  The hotel’s city-view rooms face a construction site, the Trump Hotel, the Embassy Suites, Roy’s Restaurant, Denny’s, etc… - not for me.

Pool:  The pool service is mediocre and probably below average compared to a Four Seasons standard, but for us, it was acceptable.  They do not “coddle” you at the Halekulani pool (no hourly filling up of your water glass) like they do at the Four Seasons, but I expected that – we do not mind getting up to get a glass of water and we do not use the poolside waiters, but if you do like that kind of poolside service, you would be disappointed at the Halekulani. They do provide cold towel service midday and bring around complementary Hawaiian popsicles in the afternoon.  By the way, the pool is rather small and (outside of the beautiful design) is rather ordinary – the upside of this is that the pool is much more quiet than other Hawaiian hotel pools full of slides and waterfalls.  As with other things at this hotel, if you come in with expectations of a serene “hotel” pool that happens to have a beautiful view of Waikiki Beach and Diamond Head, you will not be disappointed.

Restaurants:  We are not foodies, so feel free to ignore this section.  We can survive on almost any food as long as it does not make us sick and at least something reminds us of Hawaii.  We love House Without a Key – admittedly, the menu is ordinary (as has been mentioned in other reviews), but the view of Waikiki/beach/Diamond Head, the Hawaiian band and the hula dancer as well as the extremely reasonable dinner prices (we paid only around $15/person for dinner [entrée only] which is unheard of in Hawaii) make the entire dinner experience wonderful. Other than breakfast and dinner at House Without a Key, we ate all other meals elsewhere – so I cannot comment on the other restaurants.

Facilities:  The gym is very ordinary at this hotel – far inferior to the gym at the Four Seasons Hualalai.  It is basically located in a converted hotel room/suite.  We did not use the spa so we cannot comment on this area.

Overall, my wife and I really enjoy this hotel.  I will give this hotel 4 out of 5 - there are some limitations (not a true 5 star hotel) - more like a 4 or 4.5 star hotel.  But this hotel is the best in Waikiki.  Summarizing what I wrote above, I think you will enjoy the hotel if you expect a high-end city hotel that happens to be on a beautiful-looking beach rather than expecting a spread-out Maui/Big Island resort.

In fact, I visit the hotel couple of times a year and my recent visit may have been my LAST.  I have stayed at many 4 and 5 star resorts/hotels worldwide and the Halekulani in no way compares to other luxury hotels. Unfortunately, I've watched the Halekulani deteriorate over the years....

Rooms:
The hotel rooms need to be updated. The rooms still feel like something out of the early 1990s. The only thing they recently did was add a large flat scrren TV in their rooms. They still has tube TVs unrtil recently! 

Common Areas
They've added some new furniture to the common areas  and it feels more updated. The hotel grounds are well maintained.

Spa
Although I have not used their spa facilities.... it is really tiny and the spa does not offer all the amenities of a true spa in a high end resort.  The spa feels like an after thought. The Westin Moana Surfrider just opened a new spa and that feels like a higher end spa.

Food
Nothing very special. A litlte above than average hotel food and the menu never changes year after year. I've dined at all three of their restaurants and I even think the meals at La Mer are average. But, Hawaii is not a place you come for gourment dining.

Service Standards
With the excpetion of the pool staff, this is the high point of the Halekulani. I would say that 95% of their hotel staff is very friendly and attentive. This is one reason I have been coming back to the Halekulani. The restaurant staff and house keeping are exceptional.

Pool
This is the one area that needs MAJOR improvement. There are not enough umbrellas to accomodate all their guests. So, if you need to sit in an area with an umbrella you need to get up really early (think 6:30am) and secure your spot or basically bribe the pool staff to secure a spot. for you.  In my opinion, when you are paying a high room rate, you should not be obligated to pay extra just to secure an umbrella. It should be first come first serve. The pool staff should not be allowed to save spots for guests just because they bribe them and  then the pool staff blatanly deny any wrongdoing when challenged.  

In my opinion, the Halekulani is probably one of the best hotels in Hawaii. However, unless some of these isses are addressed, they may see more repeat guests taking their business elsewhere,","Date of stay: December 2008","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

(I would not bill this as a resort). For the price, this hotel was way overpriced.  During our vacation we stayed at the four seasons in Maui for the same price and it was like driving a Ferrari vs a Toyota.  

What we liked:
->Perfect location. Within walking distance of many restaurants, shopping malls and right on Waikiki beach.  Rooms offered great views.
->We felt that the hotel did an amazing job with maintaining public areas.
->Check in was done in guest suite not in lobby

What we didn't:
For starters this hotel has about as many amenities as your average holiday inn.  
->There is no jacuzzi / Hot Tub..  
->Rooms were tiny and in need of remodeling. 
->Pool area is closed at sunset 
->Strict Dress code 
->Parking fees were abnormally high ($22 a day). It also took them 15 minutes to retrieve my car.
->Wife was constantly ignored while staff preferred dealing with me (Not sure if this is due to a cultural difference but we didn't encounter this in any other place)
->Gym was unexpectedly moved to a guest room. Lack of ventilation made it worthless
->Tight security (We were never questioned but often studied by lobby security)
->Pool side service was virtually non-existent...
->Rooms were very close together and we could often hear neighbors, smell smoke, and even look into each others rooms from the window (0 privacy)
 
In fact we found so little to do at Halekulani that we spent most of our stay outside of the resort.

Restaurants:
->House without a key was open for breakfast buffet. Although enjoyable, I found Denny's across the street more enjoyable (and yummy).
->La Mer and Nobu were exquisite. Please review La Mer's menu prior to going as it is limited.","Date of stay: December 2008","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_20"

The rooms as one of the earlier posts indicates are in need of an upgrade. That would be my chief complaint. Construction going on (including Thanksgiving day) and fitness center is essentially non-existent (relocated due to construction). 
We had 2 rooms-Diamond Head view which is nice but probably not worth the extra $. Hotel staff with strong exception of the poolside service is excellent. Poolside service is poor to very poor and they were way understaffed. 
Not sure if I have ever stayed in a very nice hotel that lacks a bar. They have a lounge but really uninviting and only sit down at a table type service during limited night hours. 
On measure I would probably go back but not at the price we paid. A 4 star trying to get 5 star prices. Without major room renovations this will likely soon be impossible.","Date of stay: November 2008","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

The Four Seasons was a five star experience, The Halekulani was not. The service was good. We were shown to our room for check in, and the desk clerk was very polite and helpful. Everyone that worked for the hotel was polite. Now on to the bad. We booked a prime oceanfront view room and it was located on the 11th floor. The view was nice. However, our room smelled very musty and the decor reminded me of a 1980's Miami Vice, Galveston""ish"" hotel. The Four Seasons on Maui had great, sophisticated decor and the room smelled great. For over $600 a night, I expect my room to smell good, and the decor to be much nicer. I've stayed in a Hampton Inn for $79 that had nicer furniture and smelled good. These rooms are in desperate need of an update. We had lunch at the restaurant, the food was ok. The grounds were just boring. Everything is crammed in right next to each other, which I guess is a function of Waikiki, but after spending six days on Maui and the beautiful, lush grounds of The Four Seasons, it was just a letdown. We had room service for dinner, everything we ordered was terrible. And expensive. Eat elsewhere. Now for the worst- THERE WAS A ROACH IN OUR ROOM. Not a big tree roach like the ones you find in the South, a small roach which indicates DIRTINESS. If there is one roach, there is many more where he came from. I have NEVER had a roach in any hotel room I've ever stayed in, finding one and having to kill it with my shoe in an alleged FIVE STAR hotel where we were spending over $600 per night is more than unacceptable. I don't know how anyone can describe this hotel as beautiful and wonderful. The decor is cheap and the food is awful. I don't mean to offend anyone who thinks it is a beautiful hotel. I've stayed at several nice hotels and the Halekulani just isn't nice. It is worth, at most, $150 per night. If this is the best Waikiki has to offer, I'm never coming back. DO NOT STAY HERE.

I am a professional in my late 20's and met my parents for a family trip. We arrived an hour early and we were told our rooms would not be ready until 3:00 PM. Not a problem as it was a beautiful day. I decided to sit by the pool as I took a work phone call and was rudely interrupted by the ""pool security"" who asked ""if I was staying at the hotel"". I politely told him our room was not ready for another hour and that I was waiting to check in. The ""pool security"" then paused and asked what my last night name was. I was astonished! I told him if he did not believe me I could no bring over the concierge who brought in my bags! TO PAY OVER $650 a night to be a guest at this hotel and be treated like this is ridiculous.

It only gets better! After a day of shopping I went to grab some food to enjoy back up in the room. Before I went up, I decided to say hello to my parents who were sitting pool side. As soon as I sat down with my food, one of the ""pool security"" came over to me and said to my father "" She cannot bring outside food to the pool area, but since she already has it, she can keep eating"" What an insult! Was I not sitting right there! I was so shocked I couldn't retort back. I have never felt so unwelcomed and insulted in my entire life! 

What sets the Halekulani apart is how clean and professionally kept up the grounds were. The hotel is definitely in a class of its own in terms of the professional & luxurious atmosphere of the hotel. I would not stay here again however because of how I was treated as a guest. To get looked and followed by the security guards when I sat down in the lobby or questioned by the pool attendants if I was a guest is not worth it.

I had read several Trip Advisor reviews raving about the wonderful service and the overall property. We were given an interior Garden Courtyard view room on the ground floor which from the website looked amazing. Unfortunately when I arrived in my room, the accommodations were far less than I expected. Although the grounds seemed in immaculate shape, less attention to detail was taken on the interior space. In fact, it did not come close to the room's $350+/night price tag. 

In an attempt to give the hotel another chance, we arranged to have dinner at ""House Without a Key"" the hotel's casual seaside entertainment restaurant. Upon entering the establishment we were greeted with the soothing sounds of Hawaiian music which filled the entire dining area. Although I am not a big fan of the whole ""Don Ho"" musical vibe, it was pretty nice. Unfortunately after receiving our meal thing just seemed to head down hill. My friend ordered beef, while I ordered fish. Both dishes seemed entirely thrown together without any regard to taste, temperature or texture. We both were completely disappointed and decided to simply cut our losses and head for dessert elsewhere. It was about this time that my friend noticed things moving in and around our table...it was ROACHES! Not just a couple, but SEVERAL!! I understand that it is difficult to control pests in tropical climate, but this was freaking ridiculous. Unfortunately the insects would make a repeat appearance.  We spent the rest of our time standing until the waitress returned with the bill. We then left the hotel to grab dessert. 

Upon returning to the hotel later that evening around 1am I stopped by the restroom right off the lobby before heading up to the room. When I walked into the bathroom, I noticed that I was being followed closely by hotel security, which I thought seemed odd. The security guard then waited outside the bathroom until I exited. After being followed for about 10-15 yards, he shouts ahead to both my friend and I asking, ""where are you going."" I responded simply with, ""out to the valet to grab something."" he proceeds to shout again, ""where are you going? where are you two going? Who are you here to see?"" I had reached my limit. I do not take kindly to paying $400/night to be  harassed by security, especially when there were literally numerous other people walking in and around the lobby area without being questioned. The guard then walked me to my car, then walked me back to my room. WHAT LOVELY PERSONAL SECURITY.  

I've had enough of reliving the ordeal and will leave everyone with one last thought, STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE. Save your money and head over to the Ala Moana or somewhere where the roaches and the harassment is less plentiful.","Date of stay: October 2008","Trip type: Traveled with friends","ui_bubble_rating bubble_10"

They check you in at your room. The rooms are comfortable and relaxing, the nightly turn-down service is amongst the best I have ever experienced. The food is terrific. The pool area is relaxing, you are only steps from the ocean. Best mai tai's I ever had. The best buffet I have ever been to and I don't usually like buffets. The staff is attentive. The only negative is having to leave to go back home! If you are undecided about staying here due to the price, don't be. It is worth the money.

In 2000 this hotel was the premier hotel on the beach in Waikiki - excellent service and wonderful food.  I was a little shocked in May 2007 as it appeared from the outside (I didn't stay there) that it had aged quite a bit and didn't look kept up.  Still, based on my previous experience, I booked a blow-dry in the spa before my friend's wedding.  I arrived for my appointment and was told that I had the wrong time (I doubt i did - i had it written down in my calendar).  At any rate, a mix up.  But they hadn't called my mobile phone that i provided them and insisted that they left a message at my hotel (i checked when i got back and they had not).  So, it's a salon, not an operating room.  I was told that because i was 'late', they would not honor my appointment.  Mind you, the woman who was going to do my hair did not take another appointment in my place, the manager simply said that she wouldn't be able to do a good job in the time remaining for my appointment (which was 45 minutes). I ended up having to get the hotel manager talk to her, they finally took me and the manager continued to be rude throughout my experience.  What's the point?  Such a ridiculous attitude over running a salon in what is supposed to be a really nice hotel.  It's a fairly trivial experience but with other nice places on the beach filled with nice people who work there, why bother here.","Date of stay: May 2007","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_10"

Being a travel agent, I have stayed in many 5 star properties world wide and sold many others to clients.  
This hotel is not fantastic because of its rooms (whilst they are nice and nothing to complain about, they are not ""flash and plush"" as you perhaps imagine of a 5 star property).... what makes the Halekulani stand out is the fantastic service from all the staff (check in, porters, pool side staff, restaurant staff) and the lovely tranquility that the property offers. 

We dined at all 3 restaurants (albeit, the food we got from House Without a Key was poolside) and the food was great from there, Orchids (where we went for breakfast one morning) and also of course, La Mer.  Breakfast at Orchids offered a fantastic spot right near the water - on our last day just before checking out of the Halekulani it made me feel quite upset that we were about to leave such a lovely spot.  We went to dinner at La Mer to celebrate the first night of our honeymoon in Hawaii and the food was absolutely amazing.... service great.... and an atmosphere to match.  If I can save enough pennies, I would go and eat there again. 

The pool is wonderful - lovely relaxing in the sun on a pool side chair.  The beach just outside the property may possibly be  one of the smaller, narrower stretches of Waikiki beach, however, with a great pool etc. we didn't really go out to the beach.  Even if you wanted to, less than 3 minutes walk down is the larger beach area outside the property next door.

The complementary fruit, champagne (for our 15th anniversary) and candy was very nice, especially when we enjoyed the champagne out on the HUGE lanai overlooking the pool and water.   Very comfortable lanai with nice furnature that I enjoyed every evening.   

The bathroom was also very nice.   THe rooms may be due for an update soon, but I would not let this discourage you from staying at this hotel, in my opinion, the best in Waikiki.

THe public areas were absolutely lovely, valets very helpful.   We very much enjoyed the pool.   First of all it is beautiful with a gorgeous orchid pattern in the pool.   Plenty of lounge chairs which the unbelievably wonderful pool attendants will cover with chair covers and towels for you.   Complementary sunblock, cold water, ice pops.... just wonderful.   THe beach is very tiny but you don;t need to lay on the beach, lay by the pool, and when you get hot, just go a few steps to the beach and go for a swim in the ocean which was just fantastic.

We very much enjoyed cocktail hours at House Without a Key and the Hawaiian music, hula dancing, MaiTai's, pupus and the most beautiful sunsets and view of DIamond Head.   We ate several lunches and two dinners at House Without a KEy.  The food was very good and not overly priced in my opinion.   However the best surprises were Denny's (right across the street) - my husband just loves Denny's so that is where we ate breakfast and better yet - Roy Yamaguchi's restaurantnt Roy's also right across the street.   We ate dinner twice at Roys - and I do believe they were two of the very best meals I have ever had (and we consider ourselves foodies!!)

We weren't sure whether to choose the Halekulani or the Moana Surfrider. We knew that the Surfrider was right in front of the main and sandy part of Waikiki, and the Halekulani was not. We also knew that there really isn't much of a beach in front of the hotel. I can't say what the Moana Surfrider experience would have been, but I can tell you we LOVED the Halekulani. There is something calm about the Halekulani.  After spending time on the crazy wall-to-wall main part of Waikiki (about two to four properties down the beach), we could walk back to the Halekulani and relax. The area around the pool is spacious and there were always lounge chairs available. The staff is friendly and professional and I never waited in a line. The biggest issue is the beach. It is indeed very very small and full of families with small kids. It is necessary to ask for one of the nice, complimentary beach chairs from the pool attendant and walk down the beach if you want to lounge on the beach.

We dined at all three restaurants, and loved each one. Contrary to some reports, La Mer does NOT require a jacket. The food was French and very good, very expensive. We only had one lunch and one breakfast at Orchids, both excellent. The very best dining experience was to be had in the evening at House Without a Key. Very nice, mellow Hawaiian entertainment against a backdrop of the setting sun, great pupus and the best mai tais I've ever had in Hawaii. Breakfast at House Without a Key was fine- -an adequate buffet with usually very good service.  The guys in the valet area were really really great, about directions, tips, cleaning out your car when you returned to the hotel, etc. Our OF room was nice, large enough. It was beautifully maintained if simply done, although phones, televisions are not the latest. Rooms will probably be due for a bit of updating soon.

FYI, we knew NOTHING about Hawaii and bravely booked online.  We stayed at the Halekulani because of the glowing reviews from this site.

We were nervous on our way to the hotel because the other hotels looked very ""city-like"" and we were hoping for a more relaxing atmosphere.  Well, when we pulled up to the hotel, our fears were put to rest.  The Halekulani is by far the most gorgeous hotel we have ever stayed in.  There are no doors in the lobby, so when you go up the steps to the hotel, you can see straight out to the pool and ocean. 

The staff were exceptionally friendly and genuine.  We were greeted by reception and had a staff member personally take us to our room, give us a tour of the room, and sign paperwork.  Even though we had the cheapest room available, we were still treated like a King and Queen!   

The room itself was beautiful - king-sized bed, very large bathroom with tub and shower, sitting area, large closet, TV, safe, huge balcony (with table, 2 chairs, and 1 lounge chair).  We also had free fruit, water, and chocolates ready for us upon arrival!

My husband and I were at the pool almost every day.  The staff there is phenomenal.  After you choose your seats, they bring you seat covers and towels.  Around 1pm they bring everyone complimentary cold face cloths and at 2pm they give the guests free ice melon pops.  After baking in the Hawaiian sun for hours, those two treats are like gold!  The pool itself was wonderful - it's a good size and always kept at a nice temperature.  There were a lot of people there, but it was never over-crowded.  The staff also makes sure it doesn't get too rowdy.  They very nicely told several people and children that there was no diving, excessive screaming, etc.  

The beach was the only thing that was a bit disappointing.  However, that's not the fault of the Halekulani.  Erosion has caused a great deal of the beach to be lost.  The sand that is left is a big hill, so it's not comfortable to sit on at all.  At high tide, there's almost no beach left at all.  If you are a true beach person, a five minute walk to the left or right takes you to bigger beaches.

We used the concierge service to book a car for the day, two tours, a dinner cruise, and a catamaran ride.  Again, the staff was extremely helpful and went out of their way to do things for us.  Everything they suggested was fantastic - except for the dinner cruise.  The cruise was very expensive and wasn't worth half of what we paid (bad food, bad entertainment, short ride).  

Housekeeping was exceptional!  They came to our room twice a day- once for cleaning, once for turndown service.  My husband and I loved the turndown service because they always left a little present on the bed along with a short saying usually about enjoying life's moments.  

There are three restaurants in the hotel.  We only ate at one of them - ""House Without a Key"".  We had both breakfast and dinner there.  Both were wonderful - the food was delicious and the staff was terrific.  Every night, there is a trio at House Without a Key that plays beautiful Hawaiian music.  

I know I've written A LOT, but I just couldn't help myself!  I simply can't say enough wonderful things about this hotel!  We hope to someday go back to Hawaii - and when we do, we'll be going back to the Halekulani for sure.

This is a wonderful hotel that is perhaps a little tired in places, but you surely can't beat the service, dining, general bonhomie and peacefulness that this hotel provides in Waikiki.

We booked an ocean view room with breakfast, and both lived up to the billing. Our plane arrived in Honolulu on an early flight so were able to use the hospitality suite to change clothes for the pool and wait until our room was ready. A good start and our three days were all just as good.

I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel, although of course the beach outside is just a postage stamp. More sand is very close at hand.","Date of stay: July 2008","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I knew when I booked it that it is in the middle of Waikiki but when we drove up I felt a bit anxious that we were driving through some serious construction and congestion. I immediately began to take internal notes on how to get out of town as Waikiki seemed to have a bit of a Las Vegas feel with all the people and high end shopping. But once we stepped out of the car I discovered that all that I had read about the Halekulani was true! To begin with, the people are just so damned nice--the valet guys, the housekeeping staff, the front desk, the concierge, the wait staff. Everyone seemed to be happy that they worked at the Halekulani. Who does their hiring and training??
We were greeted by a friendly gal who took us directly to our room and checked us in there (nice touch). She gave us an overview of the hotel and our room and then left. Waiting for us was a bottle of champagne (another nice touch recognizing our anniversary), a small box of chocolates made on the premises and fresh fruit. Our room had an ocean view and was great for us: king bed with luxurious linens, a sitting area with a sofa, chair and cocktail table, generously sized lanai or porch with lounger, table and 2 chairs, desk, tv and a cool combination closet separating the bedroom and the bathroom. We enjoyed sitting on the lanai and watching the surfers or listening to the soft Hawaiian trio every evening during the cocktail hour. It was most certainly an oasis at Waikiki. Once inside I felt totally relaxed and attended to. I had no sense of the intensity of surrounding Waikiki, even when we were at the pool. Their turndown service completed the day and they always left a small gift or a note. 

The bathroom was comfortably sized with a single sink, soaking tub and separate shower and individual toilet room. The lighting was very good, there was an attractive square rug and the doors had two full length mirrors. The bath actually had the feel of a dressing room. The shower was on the small side--if the guest were large this may pose a problem.

Aspects that could be an issue for others:
The beach was very small, a postage stamp, and the public beach walk went right along the edge of the hotel property. The pool was so nice that we hung out there and when we went to the beach it was at other areas on the island. We were not usually at the hotel in the middle of the day so I do not know how crowded it got.
The lanai in the room we had (1137, in the L section overlooking the pool) is not particularly private. If you are sitting on the lounge, looking at the beach you can see others and they can see you. For example, I could see my neighbor's room/lanai, 10 ft away, if I just looked around or down. If someone is looking for total privacy on the lanai then this location is not the place for you.

Major plusses for us:
We loved the ocean view. We watched surfers, kayakers, sailboats, etc. at all hours.
The music in the evening at the House Without A Key was just great. The group was a trio with usually a dancer and we would sit and have a cocktail and just relax. Lovely.
The night of my son's birthday the servers gave him a celebration slice of coconut cake at cocktails and then at dinner as well. The wait staff could not have been nicer to him and we appreciated their efforts.
The location ended up being an advantage. At the end of the afternoon I would often walk down Lewers Rd. and there is a very small outside park a block or two away where there were different groups dancing the hula and playing music. Wonderful. Also it was fairly easy to drive out of Waikiki from Halekulani since we were located on the far western end of the strip.","Date of stay: June 2008","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

There are many fine touches - little surprises on our pillow left at turndown - as well as dimmed lighting and soft music playing in our room when we returned.   Although this hotel is very luxurious and we felt very pampered, I would not have stayed here for our entire trip to the Hawaiian Islands.  It is geared a bit toward the business traveler and although its location on Waikiki Beach provides access to many activities, it lacks certain amenities that families would expect in a hotel.  There's not much of a pool scene and the beach in front of the hotel is very small.  We ate at House Without a Key, which was good.  All in all, it was a very relaxing end to our 3 island trip.

The service was amazing, we loved it. We don't normally stop in such nice hotels so maybe we were bowled over more than those who stop in 5 star all the time? But no one could fault the attention detail from the staff. They knew were on honeymoon and gave us a bottle of champagne to celebrate and the cute daily gifts left on our pillow were a nice touch. It is well maintained and immaculate with a lovely pool area. Housekeeping and the bellboys are wonderful, so friendly and polite. Location is great - just the right distance to be in Waikiki but not in the middle of it. Surrounded by designers shops, this area has been recently redeveloped and is very much geared up for the tourist.
The only negative thing about this hotel is the beach....which to be honest is none existent but what's there is quite good to sit on and people watch - although you wouldn't want to spend all day there. If you're wanting surfing lesson go the hotel next door and there's a man call Ty - we had a fanastic experience with him.","Date of stay: May 2008","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We can echo the superlatives expressed by other reviewers and our only regret is that, due to work commitments, we aren't able to stay at the Halekulani more often.

There is no area where the Halekulani doesn't excel... service, rooms, food, location, friendliness, staff, cleanliness, beauty, facilities... this hotel has it all and manages to maintain a relatively low-key and intimate atmosphere.

You walk into the lobby and it is paneled and has the feel of 1970's Hawaii.  We then thought we were in trouble when we were informed that we had only booked for two people so only had one bed in the room and we would have to pay 40 dollars a night extra for a roll-away for our son.  I showed them the receipt from Hotels.com and they quickly remedied the situation.

The general feel of the hotel is 1970's era decor that has been very well taken care of.  It was actually more appealing than the polished brass and marble of some of the other hotels.  The service as said so many times before is amazing and genuine.  You get service at other hotels that is ""painted on"" so to speak.  Where the waiter or doorman recite scripted pleasantries to you with that big wide forced smile.  These folks seem to really enjoy their jobs and go to  a great extra effort from the guys at the front door to the waiters and pool staff.

The rooms are well taken care of and the beds very comfortable.  The furniture has been there for some time and as said before does not have a modern feel.  The television set was a Sony from the 90's.  We didn't spend a whole lot of time in the room. The balconies had plenty of room for 4 or more people to sit and have a drink which was nice.

Security at the front of the hotel and on the grounds was excellent as well.","Date of stay: June 2008","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Wonderful oasis in the heart of Honolulu, and on the whole service was truly excellent - exactly what you would expect from a 5* hotel.  Very relaxing.  Restaurants were excellent - relaxed, great food, helpful and attentive staff.  Was able to walk in to the spa with no booking, again great service.  Nice rooms, not huge, but fine.  As others mentioned, a strange arrangement where the wardrobe open one side into the bedroom, the other to the bathroom, but I had no problem with that.  Children loved the back of the house tour.

My only disappointment was some (i.e. 2) of the pool staff.  Went down at lunchtime to the pool and found all sunbeds ""taken"".  I asked the pool attendant for some loungers in the shade, and he claimed there was none available, laying them out in the sunniest part of the garden, well away from the pool (I had also asked to be close to the pool so I could watch my children whilst they were in the pool).  It was clear that many of the loungers, including those in the shady part by the pool were not being used for several hours, and no attempt was made to free these up for guests who were around.  It was the manner of the attendant I found so disappointing and completely out of character will ALL the other staff in the hotel.","Date of stay: August 2007","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We were disappointed upon arriving with the crowded area, with so many hotels and buildings on top of one another, and the construction that was going on right across the street. We hoped that the hotel and room itself would be better. But our room turned out to be unimpressive for the money that we paid. 

We had an oceanview room, but barely had a distant side view of the ocean. The rooms directly face each other, so although the balcony is nice, you are facing other people who can easily see in to your room unless curtains are closed at all times. The room was average and small. It is definitely not worth the over $500/night that we paid. As a young couple, it was a huge splurge for us to spend so much on our honeymoon. But we did it because we wanted the best. The Halekulani was not it. 

There are hotels all along the beach that are just as nice and have just as much beach access...and cost a lot less. I know this because I spent weeks researching before we made the purchase. The Halekulani seemed secluded and above other Waikiki hotels, but we really didn't get what was so ""special"" about it. The bath salts, cheap ""sparkling wine"" (not even real champagne), and fruit did not make a difference to us.

Being so disappointed after spending a huge chunk of savings on this room, we first attempted to speak with the Halekulani and see if we could get  a better room. They were not very accomodating, offering only to charge us double to move us to a bigger suite. We next called American Express and luckily they were able to get us a refund for the majoriity of our reservation. We left Halekulani and went to Turtle Bay resort on the North Shore and found everything we were looking for...for less. A private cottage on the beach that was over twice the size, with a better view, and much more romantic!","Date of stay: June 2008","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_20"

It was the perfect place to be pampered by the pool after enjoying a week on the more rural/exploratory/hands-on island of Kauai.  I booked this place based on the reviews on tripadvisor and its reputation of having top-notch service, and I must say our expectations were exceeded.  Everything is classy about this place, from the grounds, to the staff, to the restaurants, to the other guests.  The pool is wonderful and typically free of screaming children (we as newlyweds needed to savor what precious time we have left), the breakfast buffet at House Without a Key (which was included in our sunrise oceanfront package) was absolutely delicious, La Mer was great.  We appreciated all the little gifts, especially the welcome bottle of champagne which we promptly consumed on the lovely bacony.  After a day by the pool (I will say the beach reminded me too much of a sand box, not as appealing as the beaches we went to on Kauai, which of course is to be expected.  But if you want beach, it is there, and it's certainly usable, and the water is great), nothing, absolutely nothing could top having a shower and enjoying a few beers on the balcony while the mellow Hawaiin three piece band serenaded from the grounds below before heading out to somewhere like Nobu across the street for dinner.  It truly was the life.  Just relax by day and enjoy all the things happening in Honolulu by night.  I tend to enjoy a fair amount of alcohol by the pool on my vacations, but I must say, their vanilla milk shake was mind-blowingly delcious and refreshing--do yourself a favor and order one by the pool.

We travelled with two other couples and we were celebrating our 50th birthdays. We booked through our travel agent and requested ocean front rooms.
On arrival we were greeted with smiles and friendly humour by the porters but as we arrived early morning our rooms were not ready. Reception would phone our mobile when our rooms are ready and we were free to use any of the amenities while we waited. Of course we relaxed by the pristine pool on soft comfy lounges. We were checked in in our room and shown the room facilities personally, a very nice touch. Our ocean front room was on the 10th floor with a view that brought goose bumps. Perfect. Our little balcony had table and chairs and one lounge. Our room was very spacious and pleasantly decorated in creams and whites with large TV, cd player, and all usual bathroom goodies with little extras like bath salts, vanity stool, robes and slippers.
The grounds were beautifully manicured with enough pool lounges for guests. Seurity guards roamed discreetly while wait staff took orders from guests by the pool. Ice water (with sliced lemon) station was located near the towels as was the complimentary suncream and each afternoon complimentary icecreams where offered to guests.
The beach sand area was small but plenty of room to enjoy the warm water.
Staff in general were very pleasant and helpful but not intrusive. WE did not use any of the restaurants but the lunch snack menu by the pool was fine especially the club sandwich.
To conclude I would rate this hotel highly so far as to say it is the best hotel we have stayed in when you take into account the rooms, view, location, grounds and service.

They greet you and take you up to your room to register. I booked a ""DiamondHead"" Ocean Front room which was about $600/night. Not sure it was worth it, but I haven't stayed anywhere else in Waikiki. The view was pretty amazing. They give you a bottle of water on arrival, along with some fruit. They never replenished the water which disappointed me somewhat, though one cab driver said that Hawaii water was the best. Previous guests stated that they received a bottle of champagne on arrival for their birthday. We were celebrating birthdays as well, and received nothing.  It probably had to do with all the Asian weddings that were going on during the 5 days we were there.

There is no coffee in the room. You can order room service or go downstairs to the pool area to get it. Starbucks and Coffee Bean &Tea Leaf are close by, so why not walk a little further if you have to leave your room. There is also no ironing board in the room. My room did have great view of Diamond Head, but also had view of roof below which was not appealing. The A/C there was humming. I asked to switch my room and they actually wanted to move me up 3 floors and go further in, giving me a better view of the Sheraton next door. No thanks.

I never went to the pool, but I heard that the service there was nice.  They give you towels, water, and even ice cream. The beach area in front of hotel is about 10 ft x 10 ft. So you really have to go elsewhere. It would have been nice to rent a surfboard at the hotel (or an outrigger canoe). They will give you towels to go to the beach. 

Everyone who works there says hi to you, but they do not know your name (unless of course you complain about something). Room itself was just above average. There was rust in the bathroom and some peeling paint. I expected a little more for the price, but I guess I am paying for location. The bed was pretty comfortable. Turndown service was nice. Gave you a little trinket on your pillow. One night it was a wooden key chain, the next a shell. Housekeeping staff was courteous.  Not one complaint about cleanliness of room.

Breakfast at Orchids was the best. It was included in my room price.  Had to eat the buffet at House Without a Key (HWOK) on a Sunday (due to special buffet at Orchids). It was just ok. Drinks at HWOK were nice, and they provide Hawaiian music nightly till 8:30pm. However, it was an older crowd.  Service at HWOK not the quickest and food there was just average (for dinner). Would not recommend HWOK food, except that the appetizers outside were pretty good. Dinner at La Mer was really nice, though it was warm. I don't think they have AC, and if they did, it was not turned on.

I had a pedicure at the Spakulani. It was great! Would highly recommend. Probably the best value there.

Overall, nice place. I would probably stay here again eventually, but would want to try out other beachfront hotels. I would like to see what the Surfrider hotel (now a Westin) is all about. We ate at their restaurant and it was nice. Nobu, across from the Halekulani, was superb. Probably the best restaurant we ate at..They do seem to cater more to the Asian crowd than the US crowd if you ask me. I definitely felt like I was a minority there.  They had a hospitality desk set up for the Asian visitors, but none for Americans.

If you are into hanging out at the pool and getting dressed up at night, then this is the place for you. It is very quiet and relaxing.  But I am not sure I would want to stay in my room and hang out. The suites are probably nicer. And it is really not a ""fun"" place--too serious. And no beach activity rentals. But I guess it's a different crowd they cater to.","Date of stay: May 2008","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

In my opinion the place was nice and the service was great except for one glaring problem.  Our wedding was on a Sunday and we flew in with our friends on Thursday, the first three days, each time I entered the hotel lobby, I was stopped by security and asked if I was ""looking for beach access?"" by three different gaurds, in front of other guests and the people I was with, each time I was heading to either the pool or the elevator to go up to my room.  I responded each time, ""I am a guest here"" and ignored it, but by the third time, I was really mad and it was killing me.  I NEVER saw another person accosted like this the whole time.  I know I looked different from every other guest, i.e. not Japanese, but I do stand out, 6'3"" white, you think that they would give me the benefit of the doubt.  I have worked security for years and there is a discreet way of doing things at 5 star places.  The third time it happened, I asked to speak to a manager, I explained the situation and he apologized and it didn't happen again.  The point is, at such a nice place, the security should be better trained and more discreet, I was embarassed in front of my in-laws and did not enjoy it.   Other then the apology from the desk manager, we did not hear any other apologies or inquires to see if we were happy with the situation.  I do have to say that it bothered me the whole time and I would not go back to the hotel to stay because of that one thing.  The worst part is, we were spending more money there, having the wedding and staying in a suite, then 99% of the people and were getting treated the worst in my mind.

This suite is very expensive, but it is really ""over the top"".  There are a few problems we encountered, though.  They provide a chauffeur from the airport..this was wonderful, he met us right at the plane and whisked us off to the hotel.  The Manager on Duty was waiting curbside with a young assistant who was to accompany us to the room so we didn't have to wait to check in at the desk.  Great deal...we loved it.  However, from the hotel entry to this suite is a long, long way with two elevators to access it.  For someone who doesn't mind being a long way from the lobby and likes to walk..it is great and secluded.  The problem was, when we got to the room...the key didn't work!  But it was only about a 10 minute wait and someone showed up with a key.  In the meantime we sat at a little desk in the vestibule and filled out the papers.  The suite is outstanding with millions of fresh flowers and goodies on the table,more than just fruit.  The view was to die for as well as the accommodations.  However, the suite has state of the art technology and the young lady didn't know how to work it..as did we!  When we just couldn't turn the TV on, a maintenance man came and he found an old fashioned hand control and told us..just use this!  It worked fine and we didn't need all of the other stuff anyway.

The toilets are wonderful!  Never thought I would write about toilets--but you simply walk up to them and the seat rises and when you sit down...they are heated!  Wow!  I want one for home.  Then in addition they have a wall control that washes you in any direction and then a dryer.  Just the cat's meow!  They also flush automatically and are quiet.  

The whirlpool tub is outstanding.  Worked like a charm.  Only problem is that it had a mind of its own and went on every day at 2 PM and 4 PM, so no matter where you are...you have to run in and turn it off.  

They refill pitchers of juice and ice tea daily.  Great perk.  I also felt that perhaps the liquor was free of charge, but we don't drink that much, so we didn't have any.

The butler they advertise is non-existent.  They did send a questionnaire and asked what hours we would want him and what we wanted him to do, and we just are not used to being that specific, so I guess they thought we didn't want one at all.  I just could not have lived with the thought of him sitting in that little vestibule anyway, so maybe it was a good thing that we didn't specify hours.

Room service is fantastic.  We had breakfast every morning on the lanai and loved it.  Each waiter was superb as was the food.  This was included with the price of the room.

As far as their maid service, it was definitely lacking.  They would leave dirty dishes on the table and dirty glasses out at night.  This is something that might be a personal thing for me, but I didn't want food sitting around for more than 12 hours.  I had to ask them to not do this.  I also had to ask for the amenities, specifically the mouthwash to be replenished.

There is a double door between the elevator and the room and each time that door was closed we were locked out of the room.  Security said that they couldn't fix this and they would tell every one to leave it open, but that didn't happen...it got closed and then we would have to call security and wait.

We did ask the manager to just show us other rooms and as another reviewer has said, the other rooms are definitely ""dated"".  They did state that they were going to do a cosmetic makeover starting in October, 2008 and they definitely need it.  We asked about booking a specific room and were not happy when we were informed that even if we booked it a year in advance, they did not guarantee it.  

This is a very formal hotel.  La Mer requires a long sleeved shirt in the evening.  For Hawaii...this is hot...so we ate at Orchids which was wonderful.  Men must have long pants for dinner.  

The employees are generally very pleasant and we were very surprised that they even gave us beach chairs for the little, charming, Grays Beach. 

Each day for the evening turndown they leave a charming note on the pillow and a little gift to remember them by.  I loved this.  Each item was outstanding.

I think I have touched on every subject and I hope this review is helpful to fellow travelers.","Date of stay: April 2008","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

We stayed 3 nights at the Halekulani and we very very impressed.  The location is just perfect and we thought the attention to the building maintenance was fantastic.  The walls were even receiving a freshen up whilst we were there and without any paint smell at all!!  There was building going on a block away which did start quite early in the morning - but that can happen anywhere.  The service in this hotel is fabulous and we could easily understand why they won awards for their customer service. Other hotels should take a note of how the staff here look after the guests' needs and always with a pleasant smile which is so genuine.   Our check in was so lovely - completed in our room in private - how special is that!  The hotel chocolates and fruit on arrival were simply lovely as were the little gifts on our bed each night.   Each night on our return from the days activities the ice bucket was full - so thoughtful.  The food here is wonderful, they really seem to genuinely care about each guest's requirements.  La Mer was gorgeous modern french.  As we were shown to our table overlooking the sea, we were instantly presented with a glass of wonderfully chilled french champagne.  There were just so many little touches that made our stay so lovely.  I have read the comments about the rooms and I agree they are not huge or the decor exactly 2008 but they certainly were not old fashioned either.  I had a problem with the pillows and housekeeping called me to say they were sending 3 new types immediately to the room for me to try and the problem instantly fixed.  We would go back to this hotel instantly.  Whilst you might think the rate is a bit high the other items and services in the hotel are far less than other hotels, so it evens out in the long run.","Date of stay: April 2008","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

As we had planned on getting married in Hawaii, we had contacted the concierge prior to our trip to obtain assistance in this planning.  They connected us with a local minister who had made all of the arrangements (it could not have gone any better - truly perfect). 

We had ongoing contact with the Manager of Reservations, who had made all of the necessary arrangements for our room, spa appointments, wedding dinner, etc.  He had also booked our friend's room.  After we had arrived, the Manager of Reservations had contacted us to ensure everything was to our liking.  

The Manager of the Halekulani had a bottle of champagne waiting for us upon our arrival, in celebration of our upcoming wedding. 

The entire hotel staff were very friendly and addressed us each time by name (how they knew, we don't know).  The room was spotlessly cleaned each day (they even had small packages of washing suds to wash out your swimsuit, etc).  Every night at turndown service, they would leave a note along with some sort of trinket (keychain, bookmark, seashell) all beautifully packaged.  The valet staff were also very helpful and provided directions to various sites and bottles of water (without being asked).

We had a room facing Diamond Head Crater, it was spectacular to wake up to this site every morning.  Although the balconies are close to one another, in the seven days that we spent there not once did we encounter another person on their balcony (lanai).  

We chose the romance package, which had included daily breakfast (either at House without a Key or at Orchids) and dinner for two one night at Orchids (set menu).  The food was amazing.  We also went to Le Mer for our wedding dinner.  The service and food were impeccable.

The Spahalekulani was amazing.  I had a lomi lomi massage...true bliss (highly recommend it).  If you are into spa's, this one should not be missed. 

We were very sad to leave the Halekulani and can't wait to go back.

Another thing....go to Roy's Restaurant (which is directly across the street from the hotel).  The food was amazing!!!","Date of stay: March 2008","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I have to say that having stayed there this time last year I was worried that I would be disappointed and it wouldn't live up to how i rememebered it.  I'm pleased to say that was worried for nothing.  We arrived into Honolulu early(11am) and when we arrived at the hotel we were immediately ushered to our room.  A real treat to be able to unwind and get cleaned up after a long trip.

The room was clean and bright.  Our ocean front room faced the ocean directly and it didn't matter where you were on the lanai, or in the room, you always had a view straight in front of the ocean.

Some have said that the beach is poor, but we found it just the opposite.  Sure it is small, but do to it's location, it was seldom busy.  You could walk further down the beach in either direction for a larger beach, but then you have to contend with the crowds, not my cup of tea.

We learnt from our last trip that the toiletries are amazing, so we didn't pack anything this time.  They were always replaced as soon as they were empty, so we never had to worry about running out.

The ""gifts"" you recieve at turndown were always a treat for me and I only received one that was the same as last year.  Quite impressive in my books.

We ate at all the restaurants, including La Mer.  The food was always delicious.  On occasion, I have to admit, that the service could be a tad better, but it was definately not so poor as to not make me eat there again.  Once or twice, it was just a little slow or not refilling a coffee or juice.  The service as well as the food at  Le Mer was impeccable, and if one can afford to eat there, DO IT,  You will not be disappointed.  On the note of service, the porters and valets, are outstanding.  They remembered us and were very respectful.  If the all the hotels staff(namely the wait staff) were like them I would honestly have no negative things to say of the hotel.

Our flight back home was at 9:00pm and after a long day driving around the island in a convertible it was great the the hotel offered us use of there hospitality suite to shower and get cleaned up in.  Another added bonus of staying with the Halekulani.

All in all I have to stay it was another stay at "" A HOUSE BEFITTING HEAVEN""  As soon as I can we will be back.","null","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Don’t go here expecting a remarkable hotel – it is very much an average place. For the same room cost there are plenty of options (in other destinations that are truly great). It probably is the nicest place to stay on Waikiki beach as the bar is very low in terms of options here. Room finishing’s are showing their age, bedding is the same as you would get at any middle of the road hotel. Nothing wrong with this place but their rack rate is roughly twice that of other beach front hotels and, in my opinion, not warranted. Oh, one thing to watch out for, “Ocean Front” rooms look sideways along the beach – many of them are pretty obstructed by buildings and you have other rooms that look directly into yours; to me Ocean Front always meant the room where you don’t have others looking in your window and you see the Ocean when you wake up – we’re looking at another wing of the hotel from our bed. We have a great view of the Ocean from one side of our room and the deck, something most hotels would call an Ocean View, not Ocean front.","Date of stay: April 2008","Trip type: Traveled on business","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

I have had good experiences in other hotels, such as the Royal Hawaiian, but there is simply no need to experiment any longer. From the moment one checks into Halekulani everything becomes peaceful, tranquil and relaxed. The staff is always pleasant and courteous; the bellman remembered me from my last trip in October 2006 ! Generally I will take an Oceanfront room but decided to try a Partial Ocenaview on this trip. I was not disappointed...while I couldn't see the ocean while lying in bed, once I stepped out on the Lanai there was a beautiful vista of the Pacific Ocean as well as a bit of a city view!
Should you decide to stay at Halekulani make sure to book the Sunrise Package where the morning buffet is included in the price...it is a great value and you may not need to eat again until dinner. My only regret is that I'm never able to spend as much time at Halekulani as I would like; 3 or 4 days is usually the max. number of days I can squeeze in.

Having worked in the hotel industry for several years I know how hard it is to be ""on your game"" all the time, but everything about the Halekaleni was perfect from check-in to check-out.  These people know what service is all about.

The first thing you notice is how serene it is.  Waikiki is loud and crowded scene, but once you arrive at Halekulani, all that disappears.  You notice the perfectly manicured public spaces, the way every hotel employee greets you with a smile, the fresh flower arrangements.  This is what a vacation should feel like.

I could go on and on about the pool, the restaurants, the concierge, the spa (all top-notch), but you'll have to experience it all for yourself.   This is a real gem that deserves every award it has been given.","Date of stay: February 2008","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I cannot understand the negative reviews that have been posted except to say that Waikiki itself is a city, not a typical beach resort town.  The Halekulani, however, really is a little oasis in what can be a chaotic Waikiki.   I thought that 5 nights would be too long in Waikiki, but I enjoyed the Halekulani so much, I wish we could have stayed longer.

The hotel is quiet and peaceful.  It is elegant and understated.   The service is top notch and extremely professional.  We ate at HWAK and Orchids, which were both quite good.  While some complain that the restaurants are expensive, Waikiki is expensive.   We ate most breakfasts and lunches at either HWAK or Orchids, and found that the quality matched the price.  Dinner at Orchids was also good.  Basically, you won't be disappointed by the food at Halekulani, but it is not cheap.  But, again, you'd have to work hard to hunt down a good and equally tasty bargain in that town.   I have no complaints about the room service, but would rather sit down at either restaurant with a direct beach view.  

I was initially concerned because the only rooms available were in the garden view category, which are in the back of the hotel and I thought there would be a lot of street noise.  We did hear a little noise from the construction in the morning, but nothing too bad.  The room faced a small grassy courtyard where some weddings were held.  The room itself was pretty spacious, as was the bathroom with his & her closets and separate vanity area.  After we had some plumbing problems, we were upgraded to a partial ocean view room.  While the view was great, the room was actually a little smaller, with a smaller but still nice bathroom.   My husband actually preferred the first room, but we did enjoy the lanai with the better view more.

The pool service is fantastic, but not pushy.  The pool area itself is great and relaxing.   As others have mentioned, there really is not much beach at the Halekulani, but actually Waikiki beach itself did not have much beach while we were there.  I don't know if it was due to the season or because the beach needs to be re-built up.  A local resident told us that there is some plan to bring up more sand.  Anyway, Waikiki beach is generally pretty crowded, so I actually preferred relaxing at the Halekulani pool area.

All in all, I was really pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the Halekulani and would definitely return.","Date of stay: February 2008","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The service over all was very good.  We could not get a waiter at the pool to take a drink order no matter what time of day it was. (Do not order any of the specialty drinks-they are way too sweet and undrinkable).  

Our room was a King room, although the bed was certainly not a King, and may have been a queen or smaller.  The bathroom was the best part of the room.   It was not at all what I expected from a five star hotel.  We had an ocean view and were facing east-away from Diamond head.  There was unfortunate contruction on Trump International Tower that comensed every morning at 5am making it difficult to sleep.  

We had dinner at Le Mer on Valentine's day and it was also our 10th anniversary which was not acknowledged.  At 2 of the restaurants we went to on Maui earlier in the week we got a special acknowledgement of our anniversary.

Waikiki beach was a real disappointment to me in general.  It is very small.  All the hotels sit right on it and right next to each other.  I would not spend the money to stay at the Halekulani again.  I should say that we came there from the Ritz Kapalua on Maui which was far superior in every way possible.","Date of stay: February 2008","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_20"

My husband's company gave us the choice of the Halekulani and Hilton Hawaiian Village. I loved the idea of a small boutique hotel, on the beach and near great restaurants and shopping. For these three things the Halekulani delivered. The rest made me wish we had stayed at the Hilton.  

First, the rooms are on the small side and not as luxurious as I had expected. Great bed and top notch linens but room is a bit cramped especially since we only had one king bed. I do not know where they would even put 2 full beds. Bathrooms were very large and well appointed with a full sized tub separate from the shower. Also, almost all the balconies in our building faced directly over the courtyard to the balconies of the other building. Thus, you can see your neighbor across the courtyard all the way to their bathroom at night if their lights are on. It did not bother us too much we just were sure to draw the shades.

Second, room service was horrible. My husband (who is not picky) and I thought the food was aweful. The staff also called us FOUR times to see if we were ready to send the empty tray back. It was very annoying to be on your balcony watching the ocean together and have to go in to answer the phone constantly.   

Third, for a hotel that touts itself as ""5 star"" and caters to the rich and famous the staff has no concept of etiquette. I was ill one evening and most of the next day and we put the ""do not disturb"" light on which registers outside your room and on your telephone. We received no less than FOUR interruptions either by phone or door asking about turn down and room cleaning. This despite the staff being told we did not need or want anything and to please not interrupt us further. For such a notorious hotel we were suprised that privacy was not more of a priority.  

Valet service was excellent as was the recommendations and service at the conceirge desk. It was great to be able to walk from your room to the valet or pool/beach within under 2 minutes.  

We did not try any of the restaurants on site due to the horrible food from room service but there are numerous wonderful restaurants across the street or within a short walk (Nobu sushi is across the street).  Also, we drove up to the North Shore area a couple of times and really enjoyed the ""shrimp shacks"". What they lack in ambience they more than make up for in delicious filling dishes of shrimp they just harvested that morning.  

I had a spa treatment and it was average (what I can get in Omaha - not great but not terrible). The pool is small but beautiful and the beach is the same.  

The best part of the Halekulani experience to us was the evening show they have in their outdoor bar area. Beautiful local song and traditional dance which was relaxing and wonderful to watch.  

Overall, we would not stay at this hotel again for the price and are not overly fussy people. We have had much better experiences at The Venetian in Las Vegas and Broadmore in Colorado Springs which we thought would be comparible to the Halekulani - not even close.","Date of stay: September 2007","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_20"

One was a junior ocean suite, the other was a partal ocean view which the front desk clerk graciously upgraded to full ocean view without charge.   It was a bit rainy during our stay, not the hotel's fault.  Everything really was perfection.  The junior ocean suite, at $940 per night including tax, was decorated all in white and beige tones and, being on a high floor, we felt like we were living in a cloud.  Wonderful views from our 2 balconies.   If I have to pick a nit, I think the room should have a flat screen TV to stay current as a five-star hotel, but honestly we didn't turn the TV on once anyway.   We particularly loved the high water pressure in the shower - wish we had that here at home!  And just turn the know and the water temperature is just right, no fiddling with trying to get it just right.  

We ate dinner twice at Orchids and once at LaMer.  These are expensive restaurants, especially LaMer (our bill came to slightly less than $200 a person, with wine) but again they are amazing places to eat.  We will remember our meals there.  

Waikiki itself gets weirder, busier and noisier every year but Halekulani is a peaceful refuge from the crowds of tourists and non-stop roaring of big buses which spew thick blackish clouds of exhaust.  Halekulani security guards at entry points shoo away those who are not staying at the hotel, as well as watch over the pool area.  In the afternoon, the pool attendants hand out frozen washcloths for refreshment and also free popsicles at around 2pm.

I can think of only one thing to beware of, and that is only if you are planning to book a suite.  The hotel has a new policy of requiring FULL non-refundable pre-payment of your stay if you are booking a suite.  In our case, that was around $6,000.  We worried that if one of us got the flu, or if an elderly parent were hospitalized or died, or for whatever reason we had to change plans and cancel the trip, we would lose this money completley, but that didn't happen this time.  However, the worry made looking forward to the trip much less pleasant so I would not book a suite in the future if they keep this requirement.  Instead, we would book a regular room which (so far) has no such non-refundable penalty.  Regular rooms only have a 72-hour one-night cancellation penalty.","Date of stay: January 2008","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Our reservation was misplaced and it took a little time to get things right. The front desk staff seemed truely emberassed although it was just a glitch. So they gave us an upgrade (worth about $100 per night.) We had a beautiful view of the beach and ocean and overlooked the famous pool.

The room itself was no great shakes. No bigger than an average motel and the furnishings are showing their age.

We arrived in late afternoon and didn't want to go out into the Waikiki crowds, so had a casual dinner and cocktails at House Without a Key. The entertainment was fine but pretty generic,
as was the food. But, again, the service was excellent. Breakfast at the buffet is very tasty but of average quality, not really worth the $50 tab for two. Dinner at Orchids was underwhelming. Next night we walked next door to the Ocean House at the Reef. A little less expensive and much better food.

So, was it worth the $450 per night (three nights)? And $22 per to park? 

Probably not. Normally, I don't pay that much unless it's for something really special, which it isn't. However, the outstanding service almost makes you forget the cost (until the credit card bill comes.)","Date of stay: January 2008","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

It is rated number 1 in Honolulu in the Travel and Leisure Magazine.  They rated 500 hotels in cities across the world.  We booked an ""Ocean View"" room for the 7 days and it is exactly what we got, Room #804.  From the moment we checked in, we had Nathan take our bags to our room and provide us with endless amounts of useful information.  Stephen, one of the hosts, took us to our room and explained everything to us in detail with respect to the room features.  The concierge, well, they are incredible.  From David, who really looked after us, to Theresa and a tall blond fellow, they really helped us out.  Their knowledge of restaurants, travel routes, and companies to book activities through was incredibly helpful.  The valet staff, Ed, can't thank enough for straightening out our rental car issue.  The staff at the hotel go beyond their role and you can tell they genuinely care about the guests.  The two restaurants, Orchids and house without a key, are fantastic.  We enjoyed the buffet breakfast at House without a Key more because you can order omellettes the way you like.  Finally, the housekeeping service, rooms were very clean.  Turned over twice a day, and the floors (including balconies) were mopped daily.  The location is great. Although you are so close (1block) to the main strip, and as busy as it is, the hotel location provides you with so much privacy.  There are security guards that kick non-guests off the property. We would definitely stay at the hotel again, and have no problem recommending it to friends and family.  The property is well-kept with the landscaping well manicured and the rooms are bug-free.  

Along the strip:
Everyone kept bragging about Dukes, but you are paying for more ambience and quantity of food than the quality of food.  Keo's, a thai restaurant you have to visit, was great.  

Activities:
If you are wanting to skydive, reserve with Skydive Hawaii.  If you tell them you are a student, then the tandem jump is $125...otherwise it is $150 a person.  We also swam with the dolphins at Sea life, but if you go to a presentation for a time share, then you can swim with the Dolphins for free since they will hook you up.","Date of stay: January 2008","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

My husband was on business during our stay, so I enjoyed the hotel alone most days.  The restaurants are fantastic, there's nothing like Orchid's in the morning.  They have the best whole wheat pancakes with coconut syrup, YUMMY!  Overlooking the ocean and beautiful flowers, it's awesome!  Also, the pool is beautiful with freshwater, so no worries about chlorine ruining your expensive swimsuit;-)  Looking down from your balcony at the large orchid mosaic in the pool is amazing.  Also, in the evening, before sunset, a small Hawaiian band plays with a beautiful hula dancer each night.  The soft sound of the music is intoxicating.  Overall, the rooms are large and the bathrooms are well appointed.  The rooms are simple, but nice and you can play cd's in your room, it's great.  Nice big jacuzzi tub and separate shower and toilet.  Also, a nice vanity seat on a pretty, plush, circular rug... ladies, you'll love it.

Former Manager Honda was an excellent manager and was capable of running  a 5 star property at its best.  Its sad to say that the amateur crowd running this hotel seems more adept at running a third- rate Holiday Inn.

Rude staff, dated rooms, breakfast with moldy fruit and goons serving in place of professional security are only a few of the problems we suffered.  Although paying to stay in a $1,200.00 a night suite, my wife and I were constantly stopped by the amateur security staff by the blunt yelling of the word ""key"" which was an apparent request that we provide one.  After being chased out of the hotel lobby on more than one occasion, we departed early and informed the hotel we would never return.

The outside street is very noisy with the Trump Tower being built and the hubub of the new Waikiki Walk. Both times we asked to be switched and were told there was a waiting list. Not the answer I expected from a 5 star hotel, the hyatt gives better service. Nor could we ever get a reservation at Orchids, you would think as a guest we would get priority.

It was my fourth stay at the hotel, and it lived up to my expectations and was consistent with my previous positive experiences.

On check in, my room was not ready, as I arrived at noon.  During Christmas, the hotel was very booked, but I asked whether a room in a higher room category might be available.  The hostess showed me a diamond head ocean view room (I had booked a partial ocean view), which had a lovely view of diamonhead, but it was on a low floor and overlooked the unsightly rooftop area of the restaurants.   I opted, at the hostess's recommendation, to keep my original room.  She escorted me to the hospitality suite, but she returned a few minutes later offering to let me take the diamond head room at the same rate of my booked room.  I was delighted and accepted the offer.  

I had room service several times, and the food invariably arrived on time and was fresh and delicious.  I even called early one evening to ask for dinner to be sent up at a set time immediately after my spa visit.  When I got back to my room, the meal had arrived and was set up beautifully.  

As other reviewers have mentioned, the service is uniformly excellent, from housekeeping (who called me by name), to the front desk staff to the motor court staff (they brought me a bottle of water while waiting for a friend to arrive).  The wait staff in House Without a Key are perhaps a bit slow and lacadaisical, but friendly and responsive.  I had brunch with friends in Orchids on the Sunday morning before Christmas, and the food and service were terrific.  

I agree with some reviewers that the rooms and furnishings are somewhat dated and in need of renovation.  I was informed that this was in the works for 2008 or 2009.  

I am concerned about some of the recent negative reviews, and while my experience was and always has been very positive, I hope the management will address these concerns to ensure that the Halekulani remains the best in Waikiki.","Date of stay: December 2007","Trip type: Traveled solo","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

So I wasn't actually staying at the hotel.  I had took my SUV to valet parking, took my ticket from the attendant and proceeded upstairs to the ballroom.  I have been here previously, so I knew exactly where to go.  I was having a good time.  I then decided to go downstairs and smoke a cigarette, which I did off of the hotel grounds.  I don't drink, so you cannot factor that into the incident.  
After I finished, I made my way up to the ballroom, when I was approached from behind by a gentleman in a black suit.  He asked me if I needed any help?  Right then and there I knew what was going on.  Out of a crowd of people, mainly Caucasian and Oriental (Asians), I couldn't believe I was stopped by security personnel.  I looked at his name tag, ""Ben Arnold"" and I told Ben that I didn't need  any help.  Of all the people that were walking around "" I "", a Local Resident, was chosen.  I was dressed in an Aloha shirt and slacks.  When he stopped me, his body language said I didn't belong here.  I went back to the ballroom, but before going in, I decided to use the hotel phone to speak to the MOD (Manager on Duty).  The operator paged him but there was ""no"" response.  Before hanging up, I asked the operator what the manager's name was and she replied, ""Frank Pulay"".  I returned to the event and told some of the attendees about  the incident and they were shocked, to say the least.  Here I am trying to start the New Year off on a good note and this happens to me.  Now this incident dampens my mood!  I decided to go downstairs to the front desk and personally speak to the Manager on Duty.  I spoke to Frank and he apologized.  However, it did not seem genuine or sincere.  I had asked, ""Why might "" I "" have been stopped?""  I did not approach any of the guests nor did I look like I was wandering around aimlessly.  I told him it felt pretty racist to single out a local person.  He was unable to answer the question, but still repeating the meaningless apologizes.  Disgusted, I made my way back to the ballroom.  While walking through the lobby I passed a different security personnel, I acted as if I did not notice him, but I seen him lock his eye's on me.   I walked up the stairs, midway up the stairs, I looked to see if he was still looking.  Sure enough, he had not moved or changed glance from where I passed him.  When I got to the top of the stairs, I glanced over again and his eye's were still on me.  You could see the ""attitude"" in his eye's and his body language.  By this time, I am completely disgusted!  After the situations and the incomplete resolution, I feel that the situation was handled poorly by the management staff,  treating the incident  like it was no big deal.  Here I am, writing this complaint!  With that being said... To all of you that read this review, hopefully this will help you make your decision whether or not to stay at this hotel.  As for the local people, outer island visitors, small business owners and others out there that are considering holding a gathering at the Halekulani...Please be aware that you and your guests may feel ""No Aloha"" here.","Date of stay: January 2008","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_10"

It is a lovely , peaceful hotel admist all the hustle and bustle of Waikiki.  As some other reviewers have stated, it is in need of a bit of refurbishing, but the service is excellent.  And yes, the rooms are a bit ""Hawaii"", but not TOO dated (with the exception of the television).  We ate in all three restaurants including Le Mer, and the service is top notch at each of them.  The spa is very tranquil, again with superb service, if a bit small-ish with not all the same amenities of a larger spa.  The personal service made the spa experience a special one, and I really did not feel I missed out on anything, even given its small size.  The pool area is quite relaxing, and the attendants exhibit the same great service as the rest of the hotel, bringing cool towels and ice pops throughout the day.  Again, very attentive but not overbearing.  We are beach people, but found ourselves by the pool each day as it was so relaxing.

It used to be that guest service was of paramount concern, but now the management doesn't even care about the quality of a guest's stay. I have noticed a constant decline during recent stays, and after this last stay I will not return. Our family had booked  three rooms there during the Christmas holiday, December 22-27. We wanted to be on the beach, so we chose this property stricly on the merits of its location.

The first of many issues occured during the in room check in process, when the hotel tried to put us in a lower category of room, without offering an adjustment on the rate, I informed the clerk that I would not accept the rooms they were offering, but was told that the room category we had booked was not available for part of our stay. After some serious reasoning with management, we were upgraded--which they tried to add to my charge card at checkout!

How does this hotel get away with advertising itself as a 5 star resort, and how does it maintain its ranking on the world's best of lists? The rooms are drab and dated, and lack the modern technological amenities that are standard in most hotels these days.

Food service is anything but stellar, and service mistakes appear to be regular occurences.  Room service delivered our order to the wrong room, and never attempted to make ammends when informed that the food did not arrive. However, when informed of the error, they did manage to bill it to the right room. Imagine that, being billed for a meal that was sent to the wrong room.

Enough already! On the second day of our trip, I spoke with a manager at the Hilton Hawaiian Village, and secured rooms in the Alii Tower for the duration of our stay, which was flawless!

The Halekulani needs to close for refurbishing, during which they can hire new management and retrain the staff in customer service basics.","Date of stay: December 2007","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_10"

We had breakfast in House Without A Key. The food was excellent, and our waitress CINDY was spectactular. Although the hotel is very well maintained, the real beauty of The Halekulani is the willingness of the staff to bend over backwards to make sure the guests will have an exceptional vacation. Because we had a late flight back to New York, they allowed us to check out at 7pm instead of the usual checkout time which is noon. Housekeeping was efficient and unobtrusive.

It was ranked 16th in the WORLD in 2006 (dropped to 38th in 2007).  But there were some annoying issues that one would not expect from one of the best properties on the planet Earth. 

Let me get the annoying things out of the way and I can focus on what they do right.  We were a little early and had to wait for our rooms.  this was not their fault, but it could have been handled a little smoother.  My friend's room, which he specifically reserved, was not available.  They brought up the wrong bags once we did get into our rooms.  Room key did not work.  Mostly nit-picky stuff I know.  I guess I would not have mind as much if the rooms were not so dated.  Picture a 1975 bamboo theme.  The room itself was and OK size and a nice balcony.  The TV was a old Sony Trinatron (no widescreen or HD here).   I know that is another nit-picky thing but if you go to a top notch property, you at least want a TV that is as good as home (especially if you are paying $550 a night).   It was just another reminder that this place is dated.  In all fairness, they are planning a renovation, but they could have done SOME renovations in the meantime.  The renovations are WAY overdo.   There was also a lot of grumbling about breakfast being moved from the House Without A Key to the Ballroom due to renovations of the kitchen.  It reminded me of eating buffet at a convention.  They really could have given people the heads-up on this.  The regulars were not happy.   The food was pretty good...but kind of boring after a week.  This hotel has so many Japanese tourists that they serve miso soup, rice, vegetables and salad at breakfast, but no toast or bagels?? What is up with that?  There seemed to be a crying, yelling or screaming kid all day long by the pool or the public beach near the property.  Thanksgiving dinner was a treat.  Lots of neat food.  The fish, miso soup, vegetables and salad were all very good.  Lots of sushi, seaweed and such.  I ate at this part of the buffet first and was very satisfied (coconut clam chowder was awesome!).  But when I went back to the traditional Turkey Day food I was disappointed.  Turkey was blah, cornbread stuffing was bland, no cranberry sauce or jelly (there was some kind of cranberry syrup).  Not a deviled egg or green bean to be had..I missed home a little. 

What the did right...
Service.  Besides the problems noted, this place rocks on service.  The staff is friendly and professional.  It seemed at times there were more staff than guests (and this place is always booked).  Waikiki is crazy, noisy and hectic.  The Halekulani is an oasis from all that.  The best shopping is practically at your door steps, but once you are inside, you are transported to another time and place, quiet, peaceful, tranquil.  Eating breakfast at the House Without A Key, next to the ocean as the sun comes up over Diamond Head is an experience to treasure.  Lounging by the private pool and the pool-side service is nice (most hotels are open to the public, the Halekulani is not).  Every evening they had a band and hula dancer which you can hear from any room, just open your balcony doors.  It was nice to hear the music as the sun set.   Turndown service is a nice touch (since I tend to make a mess of my room during the day).  The little gifts and notes are nice.  I would have to say they have the nicest housekeeping staff.  

Overall, I would say I enjoyed my stay.  I came home relaxed and refreshed.  It is a GREAT value for Hawaii.  Yes, there were a little problems here and there, but they seem to bother the staff that they were not at their best and isn't that what really makes them a world-class property?  I can't wait for them to renovate the rooms, because this WILL be one of the top ten in the world.  The are so many positives about this place to list, most people return year after year.

It was our 3rd visit to the hotel, which we have always loved.  Unfortunately, this latest stay has made us wary of the hotel.  To be sure, we didn't experience what a 5 star hotel should be offering, and we knew it was a significant dip from our previous experiences.  

Please note that we are not the typical wedding guest patron of a 5 star hotel, who visits and is impressed with better service because we usually stay at lesser hotels.  We always stay at Four Seasons, Ritz Carleton, Mandarin Oriental, and comparable properties throughout the world, and we usually get at least a 1 bedroom suite at such properties.  As such, we have a more discerning eye for service and detail than perhaps the typical guest at such properties might have.  We also have higher expectations, since we know what it means to offer 5 star luxury service.  

We had previously stayed in a Luxury Suite and a Diamond Head Room while at the Halekulani  On our last stay, we had air conditioning problems in our Diamond Head Room, so we were kindly upgraded to a Diamond Head Suite--which offered a spectacular view.  We were so impressed that on this most recent trip, we went ahead and booked a Diamond Head Suite for $1200 per night.  

The Diamond Head Suite still offers an incredible view down the coast of Waikiki beach and onto the Diamond Head crater.  However, we were disappoitned to see that the furnishings and design were unchanged from our last visit some 3 years ago...and were the same as those in the regular rooms.  Though large and offering a great view, 5 star hotels need to keep things fresh, and our room looked and felt dated.  To be sure, the Vera Wang Suite might be fresh and new, but no other rooms in the hotel, even suites, seem to be!

We had numerous service problems.  Our room service order for our first night included the wrong entrees for 2 people.  When we called, all we were given was an apology.  We had to demand that the entrees be taken off the bill.  Not impressive.  Most 5 star hotels would have offered the meal gratis after such a blunder.  

Next, the breakfast buffet, ordinarily one of the most impressive, was pitiful.  The offerings were far more limited, and it was located in another area of the hotel offering no real views.  Previously, the buffet was offered in the Hous Without a Key, but we were not warned that it would be undergoing renovation, as we should have on booking and certainly before arrival.  

Next, our room service breakfast order did not even come as ordered for our second morning.  In fact, the order was never even picked up from our door the previosu night!  We complained but only received an apology for the miscue.  Before we left for our diving that day, I told the concierge manager that we expected the hotel to make amends for such an egregious error that cost us a nice relaxing breakfast before our full day of diving.  We were assured the matter would be handled.  

On return to the hotel, we found a message from a room service manager apologizing for the error and offering us a free bottle of red wine--the same cheap bottle of red wine provided free of charge when we arrive!  We were outraged by this lack of consideration for the breakfast error.  At very least, we would have expected to be offered a free lunch!  

I complained to the General Manager's assistant, and after repeated phone calls and messages, I was finally able to speak with Ms. Clapoff, General Manager.  Ms. Clapoff was unwilling to heed my wishes that I did not wish to recount the events for a 3rd time, and she was insolent and completely unprepared to make amends.  She almost accused me of lying (as if we hadn't put out our breakfast order, even though we had done exactly that the previous night, too!), and she seemed more interested in doing what she wanted to do and not interested in listening to what we wanted and how we felt about what had happened.  In all my years of staying at 5 star resorts and hotels, I have never deal with a manager as clueless and insolent as Ms. Clapoff.  Later that day, my partner called back to see what the hotel might be doing about the incident only to discover that Ms. Clapoff has wiped her hands clean of the matter and had gone from for the day!

Needless to say, we were totally outraged.  

Our final service blunder occurred at La Mer, the only 5 star restaurant in all of Hawaii.  They did it again!  We ordered 4 entrees as part of our 4 course meals, and we were brought the wrong 4 entrees!  It was comical.  They did let us work on the wrong entrees and bring us the correct entrees after another 20 minutes or so, but that is unforgiveable when you are paying $100 per person with $250 bottles of wine intended to match the entrees we are eating!  Not even a mediocre restaurant could get away with that, and again, we were offered no recompense for the error.

On return to the mainland, after recounting the tragedy of our visit and how Ms. Clapoff handled things, several of our friiends and my clients remarked on similar experiences which have caused them to not return to the Halekulani.  

We must concur.  After a few weeks back, I wrote to the Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Peter Shaindlin, through his executive assistant, Ms. Nancy Azeri.  Several weeks have passed and I still have heard nothing from anyone at the Halekulani, despite having forwarded the same letter to Mr. Shaindlin directly, as well as to Erica Kauffman and Kate Laufer, two other executives with the Halekulani.  Thus far, I have absolutely no response from the Halekulani, to its shame.

Basically, the Halekulani is clearly suffering from poor management.  It is a wonderful property that is in sore need to better management and a serious facelift.  Until that happends, all we can say is stay away--it is DEFINITELY not a 5 star hotel anymore...much to our dismay.","Date of stay: October 2007","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_20"

Had booked a Sea Front room and got upgraded to a Diamond Head room that was located at the very tip of the building nearest the sea. The view from this was admittedly spectacular and probably justifies the rate they are asking for it. But given the layout of the hotel, most of the other rooms have very ordinary views or no views at all, so either get the most expensive or the least expensive room - anything in between is neither here nor there.  As for the rest of the hotel, it was nice but I would not say spectacular, esp given the price. Rooms are well fitted out but overall the buildings are feeling their age. Pool was nice but small, beach out front has very course sand, the restaurants were fine. Service was generally good.

Hence my summary advice is to do it in style and stay in a Diamond Head room - that way you really feel you are staying somewhere special, otherwise despite the hype its just another luxury hotel.","Date of stay: November 2007","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

The first leg of our trip involved a five night stay at the Halekulani, where we also held our wedding, and then the Four Seasons Manele Bay on Lanai for the honeymoon.  I grew up in Hawaii and the Halekulani has always had a reputation for being one of the best on the island; however, this was the first time I had an occasion to stay at the hotel.  It was certainly worthwhile!  Anyone who has been to Waikiki knows that it is a very busy place—cars and people everywhere, not to mention noisy too.  The Halekulani is an oasis in Waikiki!  Once you are greeted by the very friendly valets, you step into a quiet and elegant hotel. Check-in involved walking right up to the counter, giving your name and then being escorted by someone to your room where you sit on the couch to complete the process.  We stayed in a corner junior suite that had a balcony with unobstructed views of Diamond Head on one side and a Juliet balcony on the other with perfect views of the ocean.  Below us there was the outdoor patio for House Without a Key.  Musicians on the patio would play live Hawaiian music every night, which would pleasantly drift into the room.  Instead of curtains, there were beautiful shutter doors that could be adjusted for privacy, but still allowed the ocean breezes and music in.  

 

The room was simple and beautiful.  Since we were there for our wedding, we had an opportunity to visit some of our guests and see the garden view rooms as well and the sizes of the rooms were decent.  (People need to be mindful that this is Waikiki and that rooms tend to run on the small side.  Rooms we’ve stayed in other hotels accommodated the bed and little else.)  There were very thoughtful touches in the room like fresh flowers, fruit, extremely comfortable linens on the bed and even Hawaiian CDs to play. 

 

The food was amazing!  We had multiple meals at House without a Key—all of which were fresh and delicious.  My husband and I, being from Chicago, took advantage of the alfresco dining.  My only wish is that they offered more entrees there to try!  We had a tasting for our wedding buffet at Orchids.  The two different kinds of fish, one in a light miso butter sauce and the other steamed in ginger, were exquisite.  I’d like to note also that our wedding guests (both local and from the mainland) raved about the food during the reception.  Unfortunately we were unable to make it to La Mer, but it is on our list for our next visit.

 

We spent one afternoon at the beach and the pool.  If you are looking for a large resort with its own private beachfront property, this is not the hotel for you—and neither is any other hotel in Waikiki.  If that’s what you’re looking on Oahu, you may want to look at the Ihilani or Turtle Bay instead.  Yes, the beach in front of the hotel is very tiny, but it’s actually a nice little spot to enjoy the ocean.  It’s easy to walk farther down to access the main part of Waikiki Beach.  The pool is a decent size.  I probably would not recommend it if you have children who want to play in the pool all day--this is more for taking a dip in or for swiming a couple of laps.  (By the way, if you are looking for an entertaining pool, the Grand Wailea on Maui has a fabulous system of pools the kids would love.)  

 

What really makes the Halekulani special is the service.  It seems that every single person that works there takes pride not only in their work, but also in working for this hotel.  They really go out of their way to make your stay incredibly pampered and special.  It’s a subtle but important difference from most hotels.  It seems that at many places, people are trying to be nice to get a tip, but here it seemed like they were nice because it was important to them.  Shortly after we arrived, most of the staff not only knew our names, but also that we were getting married.  We were frequently greeted by name by housekeeping and the valets.  The valets and bell staff were so incredibly helpful.  Arriving a few days before the wedding meant that there were so many errands to run and they were always there to get the car quickly and then have things run up to our room so we didn’t have to.  They even gave us bottles of cold water and offered towels too! 

 

Overall, it was such a memorable and positive experience at the Halekulani.  It is pricey, but worth it!  It outshined the Four Seasons—which is not an easy thing to do.  If you’re looking for somewhere private and quiet where the staff anticipates your needs and makes you feel like a special guest, then this is the place for you.  By the way, if you are looking for fun, there are many bars and restaurants within walking distance right on Lewers.  We are certainly looking forward to our next stay here! 

 

Wedding 

We were so happy that we chose this hotel for our wedding and reception.  Our Catering Coordinator, Ai Saranillo was excellent.  She was very responsive and extremely helpful in taking care of our needs—which was important since we were doing this from Chicago.  (Also, to anyone who may need a wedding coordinator, we would highly recommend Weddings by Mona and Grace.  Mona Hirata will take very good care of your special day.)  We looked at other top hotels as well, the Kahala Hotel (great location but high minimum), Sheraton Moana Surfrider (too crowded) and the Sheraton Royal Hawaiian (great location, but people were unresponsive)

 

Because the hotel keeps outside people from loitering on the property, it is quiet and never crowded.  Our wedding guests were able to mingle and lounge near the courtyard while they waited for the ceremony to begin.  It almost felt like we had the whole area to ourselves for the wedding!  I have to say that the event and banquet staff did an impeccable job of setting everything up and serving the guests.  Again, service at this hotel is number one!","Date of stay: September 2007","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The rooms and furniture are outdated and worn.  The toiletries in the bathroom are Super 8 quality.  The HWOK restaurant is under renovation and we had to eat breakfast in a conference room with stackable catering chairs - It was disgusting.

We decided to get married in Hawaii and chose Halekulani as it looked like a wonderful place to stay. We were not disappointed in any way.
ARRIVAL: After a very long flight from the UK (via LA), we arrived at the hotel in the evening, longing for a relax. A lady from reception (Mika) escorted us to our room, on the 15th floor, via a mini tour of the hotel where we were checked in whilst in the comfort and surroundings of our room. They say first impressions count and they certainly did on this occasion.
ROOM: Our room was a Diamond Head Suite with balcony overlooking the courtyard and Diamond Head itself. The bedroom was of a very adequate size with a walk in wardrobe (from the bedroom and bathroom!). The bathroom was large with a separate shower and a huge deep bath with all the trimmings....bathrobes, slippers, smellies and bath salts - just what the doctor ordered after the long journey.
We were also welcomed with a fruit basket and hand made chocolates and turn down gift.
SERVICE: The service around the pool area was great - freshly cleaned towels each day on the sunbed, cold towels for the face, ice lollies and of course as many cocktails as you wish to order.
The Spakulani ladies were very very friendly and helpful (I had an up-do for my wedding) and made me feel like a princess.
The hotel workers could not do enough for us - especially the concierge which appeared to be able to arrange anything we asked of them. 
RESTAURANT: My husband and I decided to have a special meal to celebrate our wedding at Le Mer (a 5* Diamond French Restaurant). Although very expensive, it was well worth the money and the food was delicious.
TURN-DOWN: Housekeeping tidied the room, replaced the towels and left a gift on our pillow each night.
One of these gifts was an invite to a cocktail party with free champagne cocktails and canapes. Well worth a visit!!
I thoroughly recommend Halekulani if you want to be pampered and catered for. We hope to go back there one day and would definitiely choose this hotel again.","Date of stay: October 2007","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

This does seem to be an ideal time to go to Hawaii as we were upgraded , without inquiring , right away . As the previous poster mentioned , the 9th floor is a gem . Fortunately we had both a Diamond Head and ocean view . The room was up to most Asian pricey hotel standards which is very high , folks , not a thing out of place , nor even a slight stain to be found . Housekeeping and maintenence, can be applauded here for sure ! The room was modern ( AC turns off automatically if you open the vernda doors ) , and the bathroom wonderfully relaxing with lots of nice ammenities , such as fine bath salts , etc .

Check -in is very personalized ; almost to the point where you would like them to just let you be . Kudos , however, for their efforts - we were just a bit tired I guess , and I'm sure most people would appreciate it more than I did .

The grounds are lovely , small , but personal , in that as a guest ,one feels comfortable and relieved to be there and out of the daily Oahu/Waikiki grind . Not as many sight-seers combing the grounds 24/7 as at The Royal . The staff seem to know or sense who is a guest and who is just having a look . In fact , one of the elevator features only allows registered guests with a room card to use the elevators , keeping non-guests confined to the lobby and open spaces . It does add to quietness and comfort if that is what you are looking for .

The pool is lovely and the beach is smaller than what other hotels have for an ocean frontage . However , Waikiki is huge - so take a little walk , if you must , a few minutes or so , and you'll have all the sand you could wish for .

The Restaurant Le Mer is not to be missed . You will pay top dollar , but if  you aren't in Hawaii that often - what the h*ll ?! Right ?! If a few bucks on the menu make you irritated , pause, and try to think of a better setting for a lovely meal and what you may pay for that . The service and food are world -class , and I hope you enjoy your meal as much as we did . Try to get a table with a open window - which usually means taking the earliest sitting at 6:00pm . Mai-Tai's at the Halekelani are also superior to any of the other hotels I've tried in Waikiki . 

We tried a night swim  ( empty beach : ) ) , and had a lovely sleep , peaceful sleep on a wonderful bed . At $660.00 , no doubt , that's a bit steep of a price ... but again , think  -  when will you next be in Hawaii , and where was the last hotel you would bother writing about  fondly  : ) ?!

Our stay was wonderful. 

ROOM (5 out of 5 stars): We requested a partial oceanview room on a high floor in the building facing the pool. We got exactly what we requested (room 933). The view from our room was amazing. It was hard to believe it wasn't an oceanview room, as we could see a huge stretch of ocean, but couldn' t see Diamond Head. The furnishings were simple island-style.  The in-room check-in and fruit and chocolate were lovely.

LOCATION (5 out of 5 stars): The Halekulani is within driving distance of many sites-- Pearl Harbor, Haunama Bay (wonderful snorkeling), and the hike up Diamond Head. We also had the chance to go to nearby Waialae country club, where our friends got married; my husband golfed there as well and loved it.  Traffic can be bad, as it can be in any city, so plan accordingly.   It once took us 15 minutes in our rental car just to move from the Halekulani valet area to the stop sign literally in front of the Halekulani. In all fairness, it was a very busy weekend in Waikiki -- with an airshow, a parade, and other festivities occuring.  Nevertheless,  if you plan to stay only in Waikiki, a taxi and walking will get you around.  

ATMOSPHERE (5 out of 5 stars): The resort was very quiet. While in our room or the hotel's common areas, we never even felt like we were in the heart of Waikiki. The pool, beach and restaurant area felt like a different world than Lewers Street and Kalakaua Avenue- both of which we also enjoyed. The beach was small, which we knew in advance, but we enjoyed the beach scenery from our pool chairs. We felt that the Halekulani was a perfect mix of a relaxing resort life and bustling city life. 

SERVICE (4 out of 5 stars): The service overall was good.  However, the valets did not offer us water, towels, etc., when we were heading out for the day, as some other reviewers mentioned and as the Four Seasons at Wailea on Maui does.  I am sure if we needed water and asked for it we would have received it. The valets did always ask if we needed directions and the concierge provided us with directions to various places.

The only other extremely small issue was that the concierge was not open at 5am when we checked out  and the checkout person could not get stamps from the concierge desk for us. That really is our own fault for waiting until check-out to get stamps; we could have left the cards to be sent but we also procastinated on filling them out, so we take the blame for that.  However, I think true 5 star service hotels would have found a couple stamps for us, indicating a commitment to small details and guests' requests, however small.

 So, in the aspect of service, I am giving Halekulani 4 out of 5 stars, rather than 5 out of 5.  

FOOD (4.5 out of 5 stars):  We had the breakfast buffet at House Without A Key (HWOK) 3 out of our 5 mornings and the Orchids buffet on Sunday morning. Both were wonderful.  The Orchids buffet was massive and we didn't need to eat again until dinner.  

We also ate at HWOK for lunch several times and dinner once.  The sandwiches at lunch are large enough to share if you are not a big eater.  The lunch food is very good but not  otherwise memorable. The fish at dinner was fresh and prepared well, but not outstanding.  The view and the mai tais are amazing at HWOK. 

We had room service once and I was not terribly impressed with the pasta and my husband didn't love his pizza either. I will stick to items I have already tried in the restaurant for room service in the future.

Next time, I will head to Roy's across the street, as I love Roy's restaurant in San Francisco.  The gelato on Lewers street is also excellent. I would also like to try the deli/pizza place on Lewers that always had a line out the door at lunchtime. 

SPA (5 out of 5 stars): We really enjoyed the spa services (manicure and two massages), as well as the flavored iced tea at the spa. My massage was amazing and the foot pounding ritual beforehand added to the exotic feel of the treatment.

Overall, our stay was absolutely wonderful and we look forward to returning!","Date of stay: September 2007","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We ate at the cafe for afternoon tea which I recommend.  We also had drinks on the terrace one night which is a nice way to spend an hour but it is very popular.

We did not use the pool cause it was tiny and packed out.  Instead we spent our time on the balcony looking at the view which was very good.

Being part Hawaiian, I have darker skin.  I dress very elegantly at all times and carry myself with class, but since I have dark skin, I was watched and followed by these thugish security guards.

I'd heard such great things about the legendary Halekulani that I was surprised to see white wicker furniture in our room, and that the ""wall"" separating the living room from our bedroom was actually french doors, making it completely unsoundproofed. And the beach was almost nonexistent. But then, this isn't a resort a la Maui or the Caribbean. It's a hotel in the middle of the city! In fact, the Halekulani is in a great location, with prime shopping areas nearby.

The Halekulani isn't about amenities. It's about service, and Hawaiian hospitality, which it offers in abundance. The staff is unfailingly polite, and always smiling. Housekeeping was perfect, and room service was also. The restaurant staff always tried to accomodate our needs. The concierge suggested activities for us, and places where we could try local food.

From the moment we arrived, we were treated like royalty. The grounds were immaculately groomed, it seemed like we were in a palace. The view from the Diamond Head suites was picture perfect and you could listen to live Hawaiin music each night from your balcony as there was live music and Hawaiin dancers nightly-at no additional charge. I had messed up my reservation and not reserved enough nights, and the Halekulani not only worked with us but moved us to a room with an even better view. All the staff, from the bellman, the spa staff, the front desk, all the wait staff, and housekeeping were just extremely polite, helpful, and generous with their time and energies. Just a few of the special amenities were fresh towels that smelled wonderful-beach towels included, nightly gifts on the bed after turndown service, beautiful fresh orchids in the rooms, delicious food in the 3 restaurants on site, and ice cold bottled water at any time. While the rooms could have been updated, they certainly were not dated and as I stated earlier, extremely clean and fresh. I would not hesitate to stay here again. After leaving Oahu, we went to Maui and stayed at the Fairmont Kea Lani in South Maui and that facility could not hold a flame to the Halekulani-I wanted to change hotels to the Four Seasons as I was so spoiled by the Halekulani-Excellent choice for a hotel in Oahu.
I will say that if you are going strictly for a beach experience, the Halekulani does not have much beach but within a very short walk, you have accessability to a larger beach.","Date of stay: July 2007","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

It was an INCREDIBLE experience that is unlike any other five-star resort.  Upon arrival, we were greeted with a fresh plate of fruit and gourmet chocolates, and they also sent us a beautiful bottle of champagne to congratulate us on our wedding.  Each night, there would be a poetic momento and note on our pillow for the evening bed turn-down.  The breakfast downstairs at Room Without a Key is amazing -- I only wish that they would make Portuguese Sausage a staple in their selection of omelet  ingredients. 

We also went to the Halekulani Spa, which was an experience unlike any other.  The staff is incredibly courteous, gracious, and really cater to all of your needs - even the ones you did not know you had!  

We thought a lot about which hotel to stay in during our wedding, and we know that we 100% made the right choice by staying at Halekulani.  It is no wonder that it is one of the leading hotels in the world.

We received French champagne and cheeses and fruits and crackers when we arrived.  Everytime we left they would give us towels at the valet parking site with cold water bottles and apples.  They used our name at all times, as if they knew us personally!  Breakfast was so good every morning with fresh omelets and a variety of choices.  We had dinner at La Mer and were treated superlatively!! We had purchased a surfboard at an art place on the other side of the island and no one would ship it for us at the Post Office!  Almost missing our flight we arrived back to the hotel to pick up our luggage and I was upset, the valet parking attendant immediately picked up on this and said the conceierge would arrange for FedEx to pick up our surfboard at their desk and ship it to our house.  They called to confirm 3 hours later!  NOTHING went wrong at our stay.  Spoiled rotten at every turn.

It is expensive but an indulgence we were willing to pay for perfection on Waikiki beach. Visit website for specials and packages or call the hotel directly for reservation and ask for special family room package - book one room/get second room for nearly 1/2 price.  They honored all of our requests.  We travelled as family of four - two adults and two teens.  We had two fabulous adjacent ""Diamond Head"" rooms which not only had their own door but shared a mutual front door and small entry hall.  I was impressed by the front desk rep who personally walked us up to our room where we finished registration in private.  Tray of fresh tropcial fruits, chocolates and bottled water was waiting for us in our room was welcoming after long flight.  The view was the best!  Nightly entertainment we enjoyed from our private balcony.  An ABC store down the street for wine and/or snacks.  Take advantage of the hotel concierge desk who can get you anything you desire from a car rental to Oahu tours.  Halekulani has arrangement with local art galleries, museums and orchestra venue for free admission as a guest of the hotel.  Make sure you visit the concierge for details.  Even though we leave our work and computer behind at home check out the business center for coffee/tea/snack and first 1/2 hour internet free to check e-mails (Unlike Hilton which charges). Room service was terrific.  Exercise room was good.  Did not use spa services but will when I return.  House without a Key was good for buffet breakfast and lunch although service a little slow.  Orchids was more formal table service for breakfast because buffet was too busy.  Dinner at Orchids was alright but vegetarian selection was not the best.  I would try one breakfast/one dinner at the hotel and maybe seek your meals elsewhere if you have time and seek variety.  Skip afternoon tea in the lounge.  It was overpriced and selection not the best. The location; however, is great for people watching.  Lots of great shopping and restaurants are one minute walk from hotel or a short taxi ride.  Nabu and Roy's, ? Steakhouse are right across the street (so is Denny's). Outrigger next door has interesting open air beach restaurant.  If you like historic old hotels the Royal Hawaiian is two hotels down the beach - get a famous mai tai or attend their luau.  We strolled around Waikiki  but couldn't wait to get out of the hustle of crowd and return to our tranquil hotel.  This place is all about slowing down. Even with Outrigger next door under renovations and Trump building another god awful eyesore - Halekulani was an oasis.  Only wish we could have stayed longer.","Date of stay: July 2007","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The bedroom and facilities were also very comfortable.

However our initial thoughts soon turned to disappointment  on the next morning when, having been told that you are not allowed to reserve pool chairs, that all of the pool chairs with shade had been reserved with towels.(They were already reserved by 7.30am!)  When we queried this we were rudely told by the pool staff that those people were around, but as we could see only 5 people in the pool and 30 chairs reserved we argued the point, only to be told that it is hotel policy not to reserve chairs. It all became apparent what was going on when we saw money change hands to a pool attendant from two guests who had 4 sunbeds, two chairs, a table and shade reserved! So therefore double standards exist as it is apparent that if you pay the pool attendants some money that you can indeed reserve as many chairs as you want. We advised the management accordingly who said that they would look into the matter.

Further to this we do not find acceptable in a hotel of this standard  a wait of 45 (yes 45) minutes for breakfast at House without a key. There were many empty tables so I do not understand why there was any wait at all. We decided to go at 10.30 to the buffet brunch at Orchids instead - only to be told that no seating was available until 2pm.

Outside people come into the hotel for breakfast and there is no priority for paying guests. Management are aware of the problem but are not prepared to do anything about it. If we had known this we definitely would not have taken the sunrise package which includes breakfast.

NOT 5 STAR SERVICE EXPECTED FOR THE PRICE

Anything needed and it was done.  We had dinner at Orchids and believe me, I am not one for seafood but I took a chance with the seafood plate and man was it amazing, and plenty of it.  I can't list enough about this place.  They gave us an upgrade of the room (better view) we had the romance package as well...we entered the room and with the staff with us explained everything.

The view of the Diamond Head and the ocean is gorgeous both day and night. The dining is excellent. My favorite is the La Mer, such a fine and exquisite dining. The Lewers lounge is a great place to have a drink or two while listening to jazz or piano.  We were greeted at the reception and taken to our room by our escort. When we got there, there was a bowl of fruit and box of delicious chocolates. We finished our check-in in the room, so in the event that the room is not to our satisfaction, our escort was there to make it happen. Cute little touches of orchid, cards and cute gifts like the hotel's signature key chain. Room is made at least twice a day or more if you do desire. Acknowledging us by name was a very nice touch too. It seemed like they know us already. It is quite expensive though (to some may not be but just be prepared for the bill) but the ambience is there.

The Halekulani is second to none, absolutely outstanding. My wife and I stayed for 5 nights, June 25 - 30th, and never wanted to leave. Everything at the hotel was perfect..the food, the room, the view and the service. We had a Diamond Head Oceanfront Room, which had an incredible view. The room was very clean and when they came by for the nightly turndown service, a little gift was always left on the pillow which would help you remember your stay at the Halekulani. My wife loved this nice gesture. 
    The staff was always there for whatever you needed and always willing to go the extra distance to see that you were taken care of properly. I can not say enough about the service you receive here. All the staff is extremely pleasant, and always have a smile on their faces.
     We had the breakfast buffet added on as part of our room package...well worth it. The morning buffet at House Without a Key is great. A big selection of breakfast meals and omlets prepared fresh while you wait. We had dinner at Orchids before we left and the food there was delicious also, a bit pricey but worth it.
     In all, if you want an incredible experience of staying at a great hotel while in Oahu, then stay here, you won't be disappointed. I wish I could say the samething about our stay at The Westin on Maui.","Date of stay: June 2007","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I must admit I didn't  believe the girl when she said that was how it would look, but I have to admit I was wrong. It was amazing. Exactly like their photo.  
The room, the bathroom,  the resort and the restaurants were all fabulous. The only thing that was better than the hotel itself, were the staff - arguably the most obliging I have ever seen. Little things like covers being placed over the very comfortable sun beds, ice blocks being handed out around the pool and lovely, lovely people make this a great place.

PRO'S:
1. Very gracious and attentive service, from the bellman to the person who personally escorts you to your room, to our friendly happy room service personnel and so sweet housekeepers.
2. Beautiful, well maintained and spacious suites.
3. Great restaurants, excellent room service. Example: one evening my husband and I wanted our dinner well after sunset on the lani. The
room service staff arranged our table ""just so"" and perfectly positioned up to the rail, kept our dinner in the warmer inside the room, and when he stood back, decided it was too dark and whipped back into the room to unplug a floor lamp, plugged it outside in a corner behind us, and turned the light down on the lowest setting for atmosphere and just the right amount nice dim diffused light.   He was so friendly and happy...Can't say enough about room service.
4. Nice pool, good drink servers, clientel are quiet and children well behaved and respect adults and their space.
5. Cleaning service was fantastic. Room was always made up spotless and evening turndown was super nice. Aside from a change of towels and refreshing of room and ice, a soft towel draped on the floor right where you get in and out of bed, an agenda for the next day, and a special gift left atop your bed (and I don't mean a mint. See
""extra niceities"" below.)
6. Bed linins were nice and fresh and a super comfy down conforter.
7. Loved all the white shutters in the room. All the sliding door shutters were retractable and when fully open (which was the vast majority of the time since we were oceanfront), they pull back along the wall in a straight line, providing a beautiful ""wall of shutters"" versus a mere wall.
8. I would highly recommend a stay in the Junior Ocean Suite. Ask and
be very clear that you want a room as high up as possible and on the Diamond Head side. The Junior Suites on the Diamond Head side (and I stress Diamond Head side) have a super private lanai where there are no adjacent neighboring balconies plus you get a juliet balcony facing front. While not sittable on, you leave the doors open all the
time for those wonderful breezy tradewinds to go between the 2 balconies.
9. We like the beach in front of the Halekulani abeit it is on the small side. However, there are nice bodysurfing waves here whereas the rest of Waikiki Beach tends have a wading pool ocean per se.
10. Little extra niceities: the manager had a beautiful tropical flower arrangement for us in our room waiting for us, a lovely planter of tropical fruits, later on their was a discreet knock on the door and a chiller and champagne on ice arrived accompanied by chocolate covered Maui sweet strawberries covered with macadamia nuts - yum! We also received a Managers Invite for cocktails 2 nights
of our 5 day stay and every night at turndown, we got a lovely little
gift. One night a lovely carved koa wood piece, one night a packet of Halekulani recipes, another night a beautiful sea shell...  

CONS:
1. On our first trip to the Halekulani in 2003, we were surprisingly upgraded from a Junior Ocean Suite (which runs ~ $750 / night) to a Diamond Head Suite (which runs ~ $1,500 / night). We were totally WOWED. Not so much by the room although it was super beautiful, but by their gesture. On our stay this time, we were not upgraded which in and of itself is not the negative. The negative was we were VERY VERY CLEAR with our Travel Agent that we wanted a Junior Ocean Suite facing Diamond Head and as high up as possible. I am confident she relayed our wishes. However when we checked in and waited to be taken to our room, our escort pushed floor 4 (out of 9), and took us to our corner room but I knew when she headed to the right suite versus the left suite, that we were not overlooking Diamond Head.   She was talking non-stop and I did not feel comfortable interrupting. We went inside the room and it was beautiful, but when she whisked the 2 slider doors open, even the front juliet balcony had a ""peekaboo"" view and the large side lani where you would sit, relax, dine, had no view whatsoever, other than their other tower which resulted in a complete lack of privacy on the lani (we are real clear about our need for lani privacy with our TA as well as when making our own travel arrangements). I can only guess the Halekulani did not read our special request or somehow it did not get on our reservation.  I am also not the type of pushy tourist who stands at the front desk and verifies I am getting the right room or not. We are at one of if not THE nicest hotels in Hawaii after all. So my husband went back downstairs and spoke to the front desk very nicely and requested the Diamond Head side and as high up as possible. We ended up across the hall on the side we should have had to begin with. By no means did we have the view we wanted from a heighth perspective, but it was FAR better.
2. Their swimming pool is beautiful, however, the temperature is kept quite high. This poses an issue when you want to cool down;  however if you are an ocean swimmer like us, we loved showering the sand off then warming ourselves up in their pool.  
3. Our room being only on the 4th floor out of 9 was practically on top of their Executive Patio Area where they hold weddings and parties. We actually enjoyed the festivities and we were about 50 feet above it. However, when barbeque time came, the smoke drove us indoors and we had to shut our lanai and balcony doors. On the upside, this was only a minor inconvenience, we soon went back outside after about 20 minutes, and we were thus starving for barbeque!  :- )

******
Well, you can see there are FAR more PRO's to this review -- which is why we will be back, and this time, for ""the perfect stay"", I will
discretely verify at check in that we are getting the room of our wishes. Partly our fault I guess, but again, we aren't forceful people and since our first stay getting upgraded was so incredible, we did not feel micromanaging their front desk room assignment was required.   

Enjoy your sure-to-be wonderful stay at the Halekulani!!! You will feel you are right in the thick of all the Waikiki activities yet so removed and in your little spot of Heaven.","Date of stay: May 2007","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The rooms aren't huge, but they are well designed with a very nice bathroom and great views.  We relaxed by  just sitting on the lanai watching the surfers, listening to the evening entertainment, etc.  Gray's Beach is pretty non-existent, which means you get to listen to the surf hitting the seawall all night...very relaxing.  The bigger parts of Waikiki are a short walk east.  The pool area is very nice - we appreciated after the fact the pool staff don't hassle you constantly counting how many towels you use.  Not a pool for kids - just a big shallow oval that looks cool.

The staff overall do a great job with customer service, although I found it interesting I asked for a Tempurpedic pillow and they had no idea what I was talking about.  The concierge was very friendly, although I was kind of irked when I asked about how to get somewhere and my $7 cab ride was actually $22 cab ride.  

We traveled without kids, but we noticed quite a few children here and I really felt bad - its not exactly the most kid-friendly hotel.  I didn't think the hotel was a terribly good value - we could have stayed at the mega-Sheraton next door for much less and had the same view.  We didn't eat in the restaurants except for breakfast - there's too many good options nearby (Duke's and Roy's were our favorites).","Date of stay: May 2007","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We had made our reservations via American Express Platinum Travel Service at a rate, including tax and a breakfast credit worth $46 per day, of $565 per night.  I had arranged with Frank Hernandez, one of the helpful concierges available online prior to our arrival, for there to be champagne and chocolate covered strawberries in our room.  These were there, along with a fresh fruit platter, compliments of the house.  The room itself was very nice, #1258, facing into the main courtyard where the hotel restaurants are located (House with a Key in one building facing the pool which is between the other two wings; Orchids/La Mer in another building, which an informative booklet on the coffee table explained was the original building of the spread, dating from the 1800’s).   The room had a minute entranceway and to the left was the bathroom and just before it, a minibar area.  Inside was the bedroom with one king bed, a settee at the end of the bed, two bed tables with reading lamps affixed to the wall (separate controls), a master lighting control console on the far side of the bed, 3 person sofa with matching wing chair, coffee table as mentioned before, end table, desk/chair combo and dresser/TV/stereo console.  On the balcony was a chaise lounge, small side table with the lounge, a round dining table for two and two chairs.
I found it strange that the mini bar was not stocked.  The bellman explained that we could request what we wanted from room service, or stock it ourselves from a local shop.  We decided to do a combination of both, as our hotel did not sell some of the sodas, beverages, and other snacks we care for.  There are numerous ABC stores all over Waikiki to help with such stocking up, and in fact they were running promotions (not always announced) that if you save your receipts, you get gifts starting at $100 (and believe me, you will be hard pressed to spend less than that over a few days at your snack/drink/sundries shop!).
The bathroom had a large soaking tub, separate enclosed glass shower, and separate water closet.  The doors in all the room were fixed-shutter style.  This was nice aesthetically, but in practically was a bit uncomfortable – who wants to hear exactly what is going on in the latrine?!  Also odd, but slightly more practical, was that the closet could be accessed from either the bedroom or the bathroom side.  In the closet could be found the complimentary safe, various plastic bags for laundry and dry cleaning (we did not use this service, but were grateful to find that the hotel provided “washing powder” for our swimsuits and a mini-clothes line in the bathroom as they forbid the hanging of items over the balcony).  Also complimentary was the shoeshine service, though we did not have need for that either.  Among the typical toiletries of shampoo, conditioner, two kinds of soap (face, bath), sewing kit, nail kit, shower cap, shoeshine sponge, mouthwash and sanitary napkin disposal bag was a delightful mini-service of bath salts.  These, along with bottled water, were replaced daily (though our original bellman had said that the water was a one time deal, our tips to the housekeepers of $5 per day seemed to encourage extra service!).
The room itself was climate controlled except when the sliding door to the terrace was opened, and we chose to keep the door open most of the time so that the sound of the ocean filled the room all day!  The décor of the room itself was white-on-white.  It appeared to be very well maintained with only some staining (minor) of the carpet near the front door.  In my opinion, this felt like one of the cleanest rooms we had been in within recent memory.  Even the white rug in the bathroom (edged in a cool turquoise blue) was super-clean!
The only physical defect in the room was that the cordless phone did not work.  No big deal, as there was a phone in the WC and also one on the desk.  Also, strangely, the wireless internet cut out one day and did not come back on, though it worked fine at the pool.  Again, no big deal, as the Ethernet cable worked.  Best of all, there was no additional charge for the internet! 
Our room came with breakfast included in the rate.  I would say that if that had not been the case, we would not likely have eaten downstairs but instead in our room enjoying the view.  We each had a “Passport” with room for the seating attendant to stamp for our daily morning meal.  This seemed a bit old school and not in a good way.  We prefer to sign for the meals and then, if need be sort out any overages later.  We ate 3 days at the Orchids restaurant for brekkie and one day, a Sunday, at the House Without a Key.  The food was very good, nearly excellent in both (I reserve excellent for establishments that bake their own bread and correct cook my eggs; these did not do either).  The fresh fruit was always ripe, the coffee well made (except one day there was one weak pot, but it was rectifies), and when I asked for hot milk for my java it was promptly brought.  If one is eating at HWK, it is buffet style, with an abundance of American and Japanese specialties ranging from the usual omelets, waffles, cereals, etc to the more exotic chicken sausage, tofu and miso soup.
The pool is famed for its tiled bottom imported from Italy.  There were always plenty of chaise lounges to go around, but if one prefers an umbrella near, get to the pool early – like 8am!  We had to settle for an area totally in the shade on our last day there as all other spots were gone by 830am on a Sunday.  The attendant was courteous and helpful and placed our terry covers over the softly padded-plastic chaises for us.  One also receives a big blue pool towel – and you may certainly trade it in for another once your first one is wet.  A nice touch was the small orchid bloom placed on your lounge by the same pool helper.  The cocktail wait staff begins circulating at about 9am or so.  Drinks are available poolside but no food.  A beer is about $6 and a cocktail about $8.50.  The vodka-infused lemonade was tasty! 
When one has activities “off campus”, stop by the bellman/valet desk on the way out the carport.  They will happily give you one of those massive blue towels and a plastic baggie with bottles of water.  
The Spa at Halekulani was nice, but WOW the price.  An hour massage was $180 plus the gratuity, which was automatically added.  Tacky!! I would have preferred the price be “gratuity included” and just print the price at $220. I was greeted and placed in the outside waiting area on a chaise under an umbrella.  I was given some spa water with mango flavoring.  Before my actual massage treatment, there is a ritual foot pounding that was basically a foot wash with some essential oil sprayed about and then a not-unpleasant whack-whacking on the feet with bound reeds (it feels pretty nice – but it is a bit odd, and I like nearly all spa stuff).  Then whisked into the massage room for a nice deep tissue by a very skilled therapist.  Superior quality treatment and ambiance: yes.  Though a fun experience, it was neither inexpensive nor even a terribly equitable value in relation to the price of the room; what one gets for the money is very good, but, in my opinion, not worth nearly half the price of a night at the hotel!
All in all, the overall experience at the resort was in the top 10% of our hotel experiences and in the upper-middle of our value for price paid in the past year or so.","Date of stay: May 2007","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We have stayed in many many 1st class hotels in the past however this one was easily the best for many reasons. 
1. Its location means everything is within walking distance at Waikiki but it is not in the middle of activity of the beach - in fact it is like an oasis of calm and serenity compared to the other hotels in the area.
2. The property itself is beautifully maintained. All of the public areas were perfect , the pool was heated to a constant temp , there was plenty of room for everyone at restaurants , the poolside , and so on.
3. We had 2 Ocean View rooms , connected as we have 3 children aged 18,15,11.  These rooms were actually a little larger than I expected and were modern and very well maintained. DVD player , etc were used well by us , seperate shower from the bath , lots of towels etc.
4. Restaurants were terrific , we ate at the House without a Key and Orchids , not La Mer as it was a little to NICE ( Jacket ) for our holiday moods. In the other restaurants we could not fault the food or the service. As anyone with children will know some menus do not suit their tastes and on a couple of occasions the children asked the waiters for something that was not on the menu ( a sandwich , a piece of plane chicken etc ) the answer was always ""no problem"" . Orchids for breakfast looking out over the ocean was an unbelievable way to start the day - try their pancakes !!!
5. Staff - EASILY the best service I have ever ever received anywhere in any industry. Polite , professional, friendly, and plenty of them. It was obvious they love the hotel and that many of them have been there for a long time. Not one thing we asked for was ever questioned or even grudgingly accepted. Every recommendation for dinner turned out to be spot on! We had the desk book us a side trip to Hawaii Island ( $69 return airfare !!!!) and to book what they felt was the most suitable helicopter flight to the volcanoe  - the day we had will last forever and everything the staff at the hotel told us was true. We wanted to hire a car to drive around the Oahu , we had one booked and available for us within 15 minutes. I could go on and on but I think you get the picture! The maids would greet us by name! 

It all just fell into place. Cheap it ain't BUT the value for what you pay is way above what you could normally expect.","Date of stay: May 2007","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Tropical Classic.","We've stayed in Waikiki and all other Hawaiian Islands and their various top resorts many times. For some reson Halakulani has been booked each time. However after having our first experience here -a wonderful 4 nights in summer, we will insist of returning to Halakulani only from now on, 

Rooms were nice -classic elegance, Beds were very comfortable and balcony was of good size with great view but not private. Overall compared to alot of hotel rooms in similar price category, one could not say they were not anything amazing. However the service and understated elegance and class is everywhere throughout this wonderful resort. 

The restaurants and bars are perfect. Amazing meals and service were enjoyed at both restaurants..  Atmosphere at both was understated elegance. We can't wait to return.

Gaining a pool chair with shade is almost impossible, and pool chairs are again only average. I was disappointed to have to share the pool with so many loud children. Halakulani should decide if they are trying to attract sophisticated couples nd professional conference crowd or families, - as the loud children at the pool and the pool scene in general certainly was a huge negative factor to us giving this hotel a top rating..  

If I review this resort on individual aspects it seems to be not equating to my overall experience.  Thus I will summarise by saying -Whatever the Halakulani does it does it well and we will probably insist on returning to The Halakulani every visit to Waikiki from now on. But Please management..get rid of the children from the main pool and create a family pool elsewhere!! If we could find a resort in Hawaii where we could relax and swim in quiet adult company it would be perfect..","Date of stay: July 2006","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Have I slept in more plush hotel rooms?  Yes.  Have I experienced more grandiose hotel lobbies?  Yes.  Have I been on lusher hotel grounds?  Yes.  However, was I still utterly wowed by the Halekulani?  Yes!  At this hotel, it's all about the service.  You feel taken care of and pampered the moment you check-in, when you are personally escorted to your hotel room and ""introduced"" to your surroundings.  I can understand how some people may be intimidated and uncomfortable with this (I'm usually one of them), but if you just ""let go"" and allow the staff to do their job, everyone will be happier for it!

My husband and I just returned from a week in Hawaii where we got married at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel.  While that hotel is wonderful, too, we just had to stay at the Halekulani for one night, since I'd heard so much about it.  The shlepping of our bags to a new hotel was totally worth it!  The staff is so kind and attentive; the turn-down service was incredible (fruits and chocolates are brought to the room); and the rooms themselves are very comfortable and tranquil.  The rooms are not cheap...but worth every penny!

Note: I personally would not recommend a SpaHalekulani treatment.  The prices are outrageous, and they go a bit overboard (too much talking and explanation, when I'd rather just use the time for the actual massage!).  Instead, go to the Royal Hawaiian Hotel spa.  You feel like you're in another world when you're there, and you also get use of a sauna, steam room, full showers and use of their amenities.","Date of stay: March 2007","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

It was like going home (I wish). The hotel is exquisitely maintained, the rooms and views are fabulous, the staff is beyond wonderful, and I love the fact that each night the turndown service includes a small gift. The gift changes each night. This time we were upgraded to a suite, which was fabulous. The hotel is an oasis of calm in the midst of Waikiki. The entertainment each night is great. We sat outside during sunset to listen to the Hawaiian music and watch the hula. Afterwards we had our drinks and pupus at Lewer's Lounge where we ordered off the menus from Orchids and La Mer. Be sure to catch Bruce Hamada and Jim Howard's performance at Lewer's. They're great. 

Don't expect a lot of wild partying here. The vibe is very calm and understated. The clientele is mostly Asian. I can't recommend the Halekulani enough. I wish I could live there.","Date of stay: March 2007","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

They should be able to figure those things out simply by looking at the hotel's website.

For being in busy Waikiki I believe the Halekulani does it perfectly.

The pool and pool service is excellent.  The attendants help you put your towels on the chairs, and make sure you are comfortable and positioned well.  The beach is right there if you want to take a dip in the ocean. Or the pool is heated to a perfect temperature and looks great with the darker tile and the flower in the middle.

Our corner suite was great, it was clean,didn't seem old at all and had a wonderful view of Diamond Head on one side, and the ocean on the other.

The staff was personable and very friendly.  The Halekulani doesn't need to be like a resort because there is so much to do in Waikiki other than stay at the hotel unless you are getting some sun.

All in all, the nicest hotel to stay at in Waikiki, so long as a Four

We had a partial oceanview room on the 11th floor which had more view than I thought it would, but it wasn't facing Diamondhead.  If you want that view, it'll cost a bit extra...but why hang out in the room?  The rooms are in need of update, but the bedding is heavenly and the room/bathroom were spotless.  Yes, the TV and furniture are older, but well maintained and I couldn't find even a tiny carpet stain.  

As for the facilities.....the pool area is beautiful, quiet, peaceful and well guarded by security.  Attendents were on hand to get us everything we needed for comfort by the pool.  As has been said before, there isn't much of a beach, but the pool area is so nice and view of the ocean is just as good....I preferred to stay in the pool area as Waikiki beaches are all public and littered to some degree.  

The food was fantastic!!!  We had breakfast every morning at the House Without a Key buffet.  They had an amazing layout of international and local offerings.  Pineapple almost melted in my mouth!  The service was always prompt and attentive.  Also ate at La Mer which was very good with great service as well, although very pricey.

The service.....over the top!  I have never felt so comfortable and welcomed.  Once we arrived, they handled everything.....they always know your name and address you by name.  Even the AM wake up call!  

So, to dispute some of the negative claims by others...  No, the housekeepers don't knock.....that's because each room has a doorbell as well as an electronic ""Do Not Disturb"" sign.  You either have the sign illuminated or they ring the doorbell.  There are several beautiful grassy areas around the pool and courtyards (not sure where that person stayed).  The rooms have older furniture in them, but are still clean and beautiful.  There isn't much of a beach, but I had a hard time figuring out why you would want to lay on the beach in Waikiki as it was crowded and littered.  Watching the waves from the serene Halekulani pool/patio area was much more relaxing.","Date of stay: March 2007","Trip type: Traveled on business","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

My last trip to Hawaii was at the Four Seasons Maui, and I had an extremely positive experience.  However, the Halekulani had several drawbacks that made this most recent trip less enjoyable.  

First, there is no beach.  There is a 10 foot stretch of sand in front of the pool area marked off by cement barriers.  This ""beach"" is public and several times I encountered the local police talking to bums.  Needless to say, it was far from what you would find at a typical ""tropical hawaiian resort"".  

Second, there is also no jacuzzi.  The pool is ok if not boring, but I was very surprised there was no hot tub.  The hotel staff could provide no explanation.  

Also, I do not agree with the positive reviews about the hotel's food.  The menus are simple enough but the quality is not exceptional like it should be at a hotel of this class.  

Finally, the rooms are decent but mine had several areas that were in need of repair, particularly the ceilings and walls.  

A few other things:
-there are numerous security gaurds patrolling the hotel grounds, and while I appreciate the hotel's concern for the safety of their guests, these gaurds did not blend in well at all, wearing suits in 90 degree weather.
-the maids do not knock before they enter the rooms.
-the staff are overly courteous to the point that they made me feel uncomfortable with their forced pleasantries.
-there is NO privacy on the balconies, in most cases you are inches away from your neighbors, and are also in the line of sight of hundreds of other rooms from adjacant hotels.
-there is no real courtyard or grassy area, the hotel feels more like an apartment complex than a resort
-the spa was nice but clearly overrated

Totally worth it!","In response to Islandwebfoot, I too found the Halekulani expensive, but I have to say it was worth it. I do believe that good service, a great location and nice accommodations are worth paying for, and make all the difference in a vacation. I also got a great package discount, which included breakfast every morning and one Executive lunch at Orchids (they let me substitute one of the courses with no argument at all, and the meals all included taxes and gratuities). I was also able to keep my room until 4 pm, which made my final day there easier since my flight was not until 8:30pm.  So, these things all helped me feel better about the price. 

This was my fifth trip to Oahu, where I have previously stayed at the Kahala (when it was a Mandarin Oriental property), the Hilton Hawaiian Village (in the Ali'i Tower), and 2 of the Outrigger properties. FINALLY I have found a hotel I would come back to, especially now that they are a non-smoking hotel (except for a few areas--which I never did see or smell). And the location is GREAT for shopping and as a home base, and surprisingly, the hotel is very quiet for all of the activity going on around it. For example, they are currently building a Trump hotel a few buildings down, and I never heard ANY of the construction noise that people at the Outrigger Reef on the Beach (right next door) complained about.

The hotel is aware that they need to renovate the rooms, and told me they are starting to plan for a 2008 renovation. However, although the rattan furniture is a little outdated, and not very welcoming, the rooms are thoughtfully designed, the beds are comfortable with wonderfully luxurious sheets, and the Diamondhead rooms definitely make the most of the view (which includes sliding doors in the closet so if you are standing in the shower, you can actually see through the bedroom and outside to the view)--pretty spectacular, regardless of the time of day you are showering. They also provided a very substantial fruit plate and box of chocolates in the room. . .very thoughtful.

I had a terrific massage at the spa, and my 30 minute manicure turned into a 1 hour experience. Their coconut iced tea is amazing, and their outdoor relaxation area is exactly that--wonderfully relaxing. They include an 18% tip when they charge you, so I actually saved a little money since I usually tip 20%. It is also nice to pay ahead of time, so it's all done.

As for the great service, which everyone mentions, it really is great. Every time I entered or left a restaurant, or went to the spa or the concierge, I was greeted by name. It was a nice feeling. They make everything easy. . .no request is too much. In the rooms, they have notes with ""suggestions"" about keeping the resort appropriate--no hanging wet bathing suits off the balcony, no shorts and flip flops around the resort after certain hours, the need to wear a coverup or towel over your bathing suit if you leave the pool area, etc. People mostly follow these rules, and it is a classier experience because of it.

I am not a ""beach"" person, so the ridiculous beach at Waikiki did not bother me in the least. I have to say, if you want a beach in Waikiki, go to Hilton Hawaiian Village--the sand is soft and the beach is much wider. But at The Halekulani, I loved the pool. I found the temperature to be perfect, and the size not overwhelming. Their morning water aerobics are fun, so definitely try that one morning! The towel attendants are so polite and efficient, and the people who offer to bring your drinks  are omnipresent but unobtrusive--nice!

The valet and bellmen were prompt and courteous, and were very willing to provide directions and suggestions as needed. They also provide cold water in your car, which was much appreciated as I walked around the swap meet early on a Saturday morning.

I ate at all three restaurants. I like the atmosphere of ""House Without a Key,"" but do not generally like buffets. The food selection was extensive, and everything looked clean and was prompty refilled as needed. I will say that the little chocolate croissants were very good! ""Orchids"" was great. I ate there for  breakfast, lunch, and for the Sunday brunch. That buffet was exceptional! I was always given a great table overlooking the water, so the setting was lovely too. For La Mer, it is the second time I have eaten there, and both times it was wonderful. The service is outstanding, the food delicious, and they are very willing to make suggestions as requested. They seated me next to a window overlooking the evening entertainment at House Without a Key (a band and hula dancers), which was quite delightful.

In Oahu, I stayed at the Halekulani and the Hilton Hawaiian Village.  

THE HALEKULANI IS OVERRATED.  I stay at 5 star hotels weekly and I can tell you that the rooms are very old, bathrooms are very old.  There is no separate bathtub/shower facility and the marble is not new.

Service: at the pool, the service is fine, they will lay out towels for you, and service at the restaurants are ok as well.  Found the service at the front desk to be awful.

WARNING: if you are flying in from Asia, most likely you will arrive in HNL around 6-8am, and the HALEKULANI was very unfriendly and unassisting in getting us a room.  My fiancee and I flew over 12 hrs and were disappointed no room was ready upon arrival.

The room size is not that big, I found the view nothing special.  We paid nearly US$500 bucks a night for a partial ocean and it wasn't worth it.  There is almost no beach area.

You can hear the music throughout the hotel from late afternoon, which gives the hotel a peaceful ambiance. 

The hotel is centrally located, so walking distance to shopping and to other restaurants. The only negative is the beach.  It is really small.

The food here is excellent. Rooms, while not spacious, are adequate and service is first-rate. The location is perfect for beach-goers and shoppers. Business travelers will find needed services.

The setting almost defies description,  with Diamond Head clearly in distant view, Waikiki beach on either side, delicious Mai Tais and pupus, a mellow Hawaiian band playing while a shapely hula dancer swings to and fro.  We've also had sunset cocktails at the famous Royal Hawaiian ""Shell Bar"" but, to our tastes, this surpasses.

We also stayed at the Four Seasons on Lanai and Maui. I would rate this hotel below the 4 Seasons Lanai, but above the one in Maui for 2 reasons. First - the service was better at the Halekulani. From the bellmen, to the front desk, to the housekeepers - they get it - you are here to enjoy and they make everything so easy. Second - we actually could hear the ocean (very, very well) from our room at the Halekulani and not in Maui (ocean view in both places). PLUS - we got a deal where breakfast was included, which was perfect. Dinner at Orchids was over-rated, but nice. I'd rather go to Duke's for better food, atmosphere and price. Pool was perfect - food and drink available. Just go early to get good seats. Surf lessons at Hawaiian Water Sports (just past Surfrider Hotel) was great. Pearl Harbor tour - we showed up early and waited forever. My advice - go after lunch and miss the line.  Note: we cabbed it to Pearl and took the bus back.  Return trip was 3x longer than the cab ride, but cost one-tenth the price of the taxi.","Date of stay: August 2006","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We usually stay at the Sheraton Moana Surfrider but decided to include a short 2-night stay at the Halekulani.  The decidedly mixed reviews on tripadvisor intrigued me and I knew that I would probably either love it or hate it.  As it turned out, my feelings fell somewhere in between.  

To give you some background, I am a 29year old Aussie who visited the hotel with my sister.

We booked a Diamond Head Deluxe view room through the Leading Hotel of the World.  We paid $USD600 per night (inclusive of taxes).  The lobby was quite basic, fitting in with a relax resort theme.  Check in was friendly & efficient.  The grounds are just lovely and there are plenty of areas to just sit, relax and enjoy the atmosphere.

ROOM:

The room was of a standard size and was definitely very average for the price we paid.  But after reading reviews on tripadvisor I knew what to expect.  Very subtle, pale colours used.  There is no doubt in my mind that the main room area needs to be updated.  The room was too bland and definitely needed a splash of colour.  Secondly, the beds were terrible.  Very hard and was not conducive to a good nights sleep.  Now to the good part.  The bathroom was fantastic, very large, beautiful deep tub, designed perfectly and in total contrast to the main room.  Finally, the most divine view in Waikiki, Diamond Head.  I definitely recommend spending more and getting a Diamond Head view.  The balcony was of a good size and definitely spacious enough to enjoy a meal outside.  Now the negative points: the balcony decor was cheap and tacky, very basic and secondly our balcony view was impeded by about 60cm cement wall before the view actually started (we noticed most floors had a total view) this was disappointing because when sitting in bed you couldn't enjoy all the view.
 
STAFF/SERVICE
The Halekulani is renowned for its personalised service and we definitely received some amazing service but we also received some positively dreadful service.  We ran into our check in agent several times during our stay and he always greeted us by name.  We were very impressed and in all the hotels that I have ever stayed at this has never happened.  

When we arrived in our room we were told that we would receive a welcome gift and after 2 hours of it not arriving we contacted reception who apologised and said they would send it right up after another 1 hour wait I called again and finally it arrived. 

I also had an issue with a bathrobe, which I went to use and had a large bloodstain on it, absolutely disgusting, a new bathrobe was promptly delivered.

Finally, we had to check out the pool, we took some seats away from the sun a few rows back from the pool.  We waited 30 minutes and no one came to offer us a towel or offer us a menu.  I saw many other people wait less than a 5 seconds for an attendant and I started getting annoyed.  I went to the lovely restaurant house without a key to get some service and I ordered my drink.  5 minutes later the pool attendant come over with the drink and with no apologies.  We asked why we received no service and he honestly said that he did not believe that we were guests.  Now I know that we are not your usual Halekulani guests as the hotel hosts mainly Japanese & honeymooners but it was really unprofessional.

FOOD/RESTAURANTS

We had breakfast included in our package every morning at House without a key.  There isn't a huge selection and the pastries were truly terrible, however we were more than happy with it, there is something for everyone.  The service was always fantastic and again my name was remembered every time I went into the restaurant.  I was also impressed that all taxes & tips were included in our breakfast package.

We also had the most wonderful lunch at House Without a Key, a beautiful seafood pasta that was divine, the quality was just fantastic.  While we sat at this restaurant we really felt that we were miles away from Waikiki bustle. Just brilliant.

We also had a wonderful afternoon tea, which I highly recommended, the quality of the food was fantastic, the service very personalised and it was just lovely.

SPA

As part of our package I received a free massage.  Again I was impressed that all costs including taxes and tip were covered.  The spa is lovely although certainly doesn't compare to the spas in Asia.  The service was great and the treatment was nothing like I had ever received.  They really try to create something altogether different.  I was most happy and the final touch was great.  You get to sit out in a the spa courtyard with an ice tea and frozen fruit skewers for as long as you like, a perfect end to a great treatment.  

OVERVIEW
Overall there were elements to the Halekulani that were unique and fantastic and then other parts that were really disappointing.  I also came to my own conclusion that there maybe was a reason why some people love the Halekulani and others hate it.  If you have never been to a 5 star Asian resort, with their low rates, deluxe rooms and fittings, divine food, endless buffets then the Halekulani will probably blow you away.  But if you have, then you will know that there is better out there at far more value for money.  In saying that I do believe that the Halekulani is unique to the Waikiki area as is definitely the best hotel if you are on your honeymoon or want a very quiet holiday.  Would I go back, I don't think so, although I am happy that I went.  Go for 2 or 3 nights and judge for yourself.  I would definitely only recommend going if you can get yourself a package deal.  We paid $USD600 per night that included daily breakfast for two, a afternoon tea for 2, a lunch for 2 and a free massage for 1 and a late checkout to 4pm.  With all these additions I ended the stay satisfied that I got good value for money.  Now if I did not receive any additional benefits I would definitely have felt short-changed.  

Anyway I hope that this helps and enjoy your holiday!

No, thankfully, there is none of that obvious, flashy red-velvet-and-gilt-mirrors type of luxury.  Everything is refined and understated, for people with the good taste to appreciate less things but everything the absolute best.   

The rooms are quiet, with nothing jarring and nothing extraneous, the beds are insanely comfortable, the sheets crisp and spotless.  The rooms have sliding plantation doors which gives it an airy, genteel feel.  The bathrooms feature luscious deep soaking tubs and separate showers.  There is a very unusual 1930s-colonial feel which feels very modern but also not too trendy or tech-y or like it's trying too hard.  The rooms are also quite spacious.  If you are here for romance, this is an outstanding place to stay in bed and enjoy relaxing and each other.  You'll also love the spacious lanai with the most comfortable outdoor furniture on Waikiki.

I have to admit that the pool is not super-fabulous, it is small by modern standards and there is none of the faux-waterfall construction that newer 5-stars have.  Also, the deck is quite small so there are tons of lounges set on the lawn - a lot of people like this natural feeling but I'm not crazy about it.  It's definitely an adults pool, a place to relax more than super-fun to swim in.

The beach is very narrow here, you really aren't going to want to stretch out on the tiny parcel and unfortunately the surrounding beaches are pretty tacky - think South Florida.  But the view is amazing, and laying out by the pool as the ocean breaks a few feet away is lovely.

And the restaurants are superb.  La Mer is one of the world's top tables and the food is exquisitely prepared with the freshest fish, creative amuses-bouches, complimentary champagne, fresh breads and the yummiest dessert course with lots of little extras thrown in.  Considering you can get the set menu for 2 (including champagne and the chef sends out several little extras) for around $150 I think it's the best fine dining bargain I've ever had.

The Sunday brunch at Orchids is delicious, not TONS of food but more than enough when food is this delicious you don't need more.  It includes several entrees, perfect roasts, fish, a sushi/sashimi bar, an extensive Korean, Chinese and Japanese table, a waffle bar and ice cream sundae bar and the biggest dessert table ever.

The Lewers Lounge is a sophisticated place - it's not a meat-market and the clientele is well-dressed and quiet.  The live lounge-y music is pleasantly retro and very good and although all the drinks are great, the House Specialties are truly, truly extraordinary.

And the service is wonderful, everyone knows your name and your preferences - I would definitely recommend walking in with  20 bucks in ones/fives  just to drop tips here and there because everyone really goes out of their way.

The Halekulani is really just perfection, by far the best place in Waikiki and one of the calmest, most refined hotels in the world.","Date of stay: December 2006","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I cannot say enough good things about this hotel.  We have stayed at Four Seasons Maui, Ritz Carlton Maui and years ago at Kapalua and while they are beautiful properties, we like the relaxed and un pretentious feeling of this hotel.  Many of the staff are beginining to remember us.  

We have learned to FedEx a small bag with tolietries and a few clothes ahead and just carry on the rest.  The consierge arranged a limo to pick us up at the gate.  This is one of two airports in the United States where your limo can pick you up directly from the gate.  There are only two limo services in Honolulu who have the security clearance to do this.  It's wonderful skipping the long walk to the baggage claim and airport exit and simply jump in the car and be off to the hotel.

They have just finished the construction on the Embassy Suites behind us so this wasn't a problem.  While this is on Wakiki, it seems like we're away from it all but still have the options to walk a block or two for shopping or short taxi to great Honolulu restaurants.  We usually walk a short distance down the beach in front of the Royal Hawaiian for the perfect Waikiki  beach experience.  It's amazing to be able to wade 100 feet from the beach in these warm shallow waters.  

We brought my mother and her husband to celebrate her 70th and Thanksgiving. This location gave them great options to do all the tourist things while we just relaxed.  Next year we'll probably come again for Thanksgivng with my brother's family and kids can stay at the new Embassy Suites and the adults across the street at the Halukalani.  

The staff are very professional and courteous but the best is the setting and the refined grace with which everything is presented.  If you want to scream, ""I am rich"" go to the Ritz or other flashy hotels.  If you're more refined and don't need all the splash to experience paradise,  I'd stay at this hotel.  There are few kids here but the ones that are here seem to be better behaved than at the Four Seasons.  We had an aweful experience there where the kids ran wild and took over the adult pool while the parents just their misbehavior. Here, what few children we see  seem to be mostly Japanesse children who culturally seem to be much better behaved than their American counterpart.","Date of stay: November 2006","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Our experience at the Halekulani was a joke.  When we arrived to check in, they told us it would be a few minutes.  Three hours later we had our room.  Our whole day was ruined by waiting in their ""lobby"".  We were treated like second class citizens next to international guests.  While many were warm and welcoming, most of the aloha spirit was no where to be found in positions of authority among the staff.  It ruined the end of a great trip.  We will not go back to Waikiki and definitely don't recommend spending your hard earned money at the Halekulani.  We highly recommend the RitzCarlton in Maui.

My husband and I had our wedding ceremony on November 11th at a church in Honolulu, and we selected Halekulani as a place to stay because there were so many details involved in the wedding preparation. In addition, my husband is Japanese and I am American, so our families flew from both directions to meet in Hawaii, and we wanted to take advantage of Halekulani's facilities as a base for our special occasion -- We figured that if it was really a five star hotel, everything would be flawless and we wouldn't have to worry. We were right. (For those who are reading, our review might be a little different than others in the sense of wedding prep, an int'l reunion, etc... but if you are interested, please read on...) We stayed at the Four Seasons Hualalai on the Big Island for three nights, but the whole time we were there on the Big Island, we kept talking about how much we missed Halekulani.

Upon checking in, a very nice young woman named Serah from the front desk led us up to our room, and told us that we had been upgraded from a regular Ocean Front room to a Diamond Head View room. The view was AMAZING! When we walked in, the screen doors were opened to let in a fantastic soft breeze. Serah sat with us while we asked lots of questions about the area-- Having lived in Japan for so long, it sounds funny but I really desired American pizza (which I ended up not ordering), but a delivery menu was sent up to our room within the next couple of minutes. Soonafter, a tray with fresh fruits and chocolates was brought to the room (apparently this is included in all rooms), and because we were soon to get married, we noticed a big bottle of champagne on our shelf. We were in heaven eating papaya and drinking champagne on our balcony.

About the room, ""understated elegance"" is definitely true. Everything was off-white-- the bathroom was amazing with huge mirrors, lots of amenities, a deep soaking tub (which we filled with rose petals one night ;-) ) and a walk-in, glass-enclosed shower. Also, the bed was the most comfortable bed I had ever slept on-- even better in comparison to the Four Seasons! 

For the wedding celebration, my mother and I had corresponded with House Without A Key and La Mer MONTHS before our arrival. While House Without A Key does not accept reservations, they acknowledged that 15 of us would be coming, and on the condition that we come at an early time, they set up chairs for us-- RIGHT in front of the stage (there is Hawaiian music and hula dancing from 5pm each evening). The seating (and the sunset off to the right) couldn't have been better. At La Mer, we reserved the small dining room for 11 people and made very specific requests re: each person's menu selections, the kind of centerpiece and cake we wanted, etc... after doing LOTS of research and corresponding by e-mail with the restaurant manager. The result was a flawless experience from start to finish, and the food was amazing. Because they had already had our party menu requests, we did not have to say a word-- and we were extremely grateful for this, considering some in our party can not speak english. After the dinner, upon our request, the centerpiece of about 20 huge roses were delivered to our room.

Many reviewers said that the hotel workers remembered their name, and it's true! Of course, if you make a call to the front desk, your name is bound to pop up on their computer. But one day I approached the concierge to ask where to find waterproof mascara remover in Honolulu, and the concierge (Daryce) said to me, ""Are you Mrs. ****? I'm the one you spoke with on the phone from Japan.""--and I hadn't even mentioned that I had come from Japan-- I wonder how she knew?!  Also, the day after the wedding, after all of my makeup had come off and I was wearing regular clothes, I was walking out of the hotel, and one of the valets said to me, ""Good morning. Day after the wedding, huh?"" with a big smile... I was so surprised and happy that among all of the people who he meets, he recognized me (even without my makeup! ;-) ) Lastly, my husband and I ate Sunday brunch at Orchids. There were no pancakes on that day (apparently they switch back and forth between pancakes and waffles). I had just asked the waiter if there were pancakes (in case I missed them amongst all of the other foods available), and a few minutes later he brought a plate of pancakes to me, saying that the chef had prepared a special order upon request!  The juices were freshly squeezed and amazing.

Because of all of the fabulous service we received, I feel sorry that other reviewers on this site would say that the service at this hotel was impersonal. Yes, Halekulani is located in a crowded city-- land is more scarce so the lobby is not huge and there are people walking around, but considering the land space available, it was more than adequate in size. Not only that, but there was always a soft breeze blowing through the lobby with the fragrant smell of flowers in the courtyard and the sound of tinkling water in the background... It was an oasis.  The lobby is set up in such a way that people pass by the sitting area but do not walk back into it in case they would like to sit down. Also, other hotels are filled with hallways and hallways of shops, but we were thankful that Halekulani was smaller and more elegant.
Compared to the Four Seasons Hualalai, my husband and I both found the workers to be much more friendly and personable.

Sorry this review is so long, but my husband and I will definitely go back  to Halekulani again. In a way, I felt that we had ""put Halekulani to the test"". Of course, every hotel has little glitches, but If the hotel successfully came through for us on every little detail during such a big occasion this time, they are sure to come through again.","Date of stay: November 2006","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

While the property itself is elegant and lovely, we found it to be somewhat cold and unwelcoming.  The lobby is very small, really only consisting of a few seating areas, and was jammed with people coming and going every time we passed by.   (Major construction on both sides - not their fault - but loud).

There is no bar in the entire hotel - no place to just sit and have a cocktail - unless you go into one of the restaurants and sit at a table.  And finally, the beach is LITERALLY 50 ft x 75 feet and almost unusable at high tide.

The check in service was gracious (they bring you up to your room for the process), the view was spectacular, but the rooms were average (dated looking) and lacked a coffee maker and iron/ironing board.

We chose to find another hotel shortly after checking in - and the manager was accommodating in letting us out of our reservation without penalty.

We expected ""Ritz-Carlton like"" service and quality at this renowned property...especially for the steep price...and we were very disappointed.  We moved to the Sheraton Moana Surfrider where we were welcomed with leis, cold face towels and glasses of guava juice upon check in - and the staff was outstanding.","Date of stay: November 2006","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

The service is the high point, with wonderful, friendly staff that goes out of their way to make your stay special.  The pace of the hotel and the tone is also special - despite ongoing major construction outside of the property, the pool is quiet and the property seems an oasis.  We started out trip at the Hilton Hawaiian Village - it's not even close to the Halekulani's class.

We stayed with our one year old.  If you can afford the bill (two rooms @ $400 a night) - it's heavenly.  The staff doted on our daughter, from the pool staff to the restaurant hostess (Erin is wonderful), to the waiters (Guy is fantastic).  We'd do it again in a heartbeat.

The hotel restaurants were quite nice - House Without a Key is the grill, hosting the wonderful breakfast buffet and good lunch/dinner despite a limited selection.  Stick with the fish of the day and you'll be happy.  Orchids is a great higher end restaurant (mostly fish), while we missed La Mer due to limited time (watching a one year old).  

There are a few negatives, but they are minor and there doesn't seem to be any better choice around.  The rooms are a bit outdated - the beds could be updated (though the linens are great).  The beach is limited - the hotel is seaside, but erosion has really taken a toll and more than half of the beachside is a seawall rather than beach.  The pool makes up for it, and you can drive to wonderful beaches on the island, but don't count on lots of beach time while at the property.","Date of stay: October 2006","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I decided to call a travel agent to ask her opinion about the Halekulani. I'm really glad I did! She said that the Halekulani was one of the finest hotels that she had ever gone to in the world. So we went.

The one thing that is hard to understand about this hotel (compared to all of the others in Waikiki), is how serene it is. You walk in to the lobby and it's suddenly peaceful. You go to the pool and there are plenty of chairs. Every area of the grounds has some of the best views and you never feel stressed that you will be too late to get a spot. The service is better than any place I have every been. As I was leaving my room quickly one day, the 3 maids were just coming in and they smiled and said ""have a nice day Mr.____"". The maids knew my name! That never happens.

Suffice to say, I love this hotel. My wife and I are really picky about interior design and location. The rooms were really nice. Even though the furniture did look a tad dated, the overall polish and design of the rooms were great. Premium bedding and attention to detail. Fantastic bathroom. The balcony was huge and a joy to just sit and relax on.

Also, being a surfer, it was great being right in front of Populars and Paradise surf breaks. You could see Canoes, the main one on Waikiki was always wedged with people but not so for the breaks in front of the Halekulani. Easy rentals by the hotel as well.

It's expensive but believe me, it is money well spent!","Date of stay: August 2006","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We were there for a convention and were told the Halekulani was the best there is in Waikiki.  We did not doubt that, since others at the meeting staying at other properties spoke of dirty rooms and roaches at their hotels.  The Halekulani is a very nice property, but nothing special if you are used to staying at 5 star hotels, which we always do, as we are both VERY picky.  Our room (ocean view) was small and we could barely turn around due to the fact that we had to have a roll-away in the room. My husband resorted to moving the furniture around and taking away the coffee table so we could have room to walk.  We were told they have no rooms with 2 double or queen beds, just a king or 2 twins.  The bathroom, while trying to appear updated, had the smallest shower I have ever seen at a hotel, with a faucet/exposed pipes that looked like something from the 1930's. The bath tub was dingy, and looked like all the shiny porcelain finish had been worn off.   The rooms are very stark, all white, no wallpaper, minimal decorations.  Maybe some find this ""understated"", but we found it to look like a low priced motel room.  

The restaurant service was fine. Ate at Orchids and the main restaurant daily with my son, as my husband was in meetings all day and there was really no where to go with a 6 yr. old besides the pool.   Ordered room service several times for our son for breakfast and dinner.  Good food, delivered promptly.

Staff was friendly and efficient.  Housekeeping was fine during the day. They even wipe off the lanai, but the lanai furniture was stained and dirty. Turndown service was hit or miss.  Didn't come until 9:30 p.m. on two occasions (when we had already returned for the night and our son was sleeping) and not at all one night.  The special ""gift"" each night was  a seashell, which we could have done without.  Just more junk for a child to want to lug around.

The pool was small by resort standards. It was also full of sand, as alot of people do not use the beach showers when returning from the beach.  Pool did not seem exceptionally clean either.   Lots of children congregated around the steps, making it hard to get in and out.  
The pool employees were excellent.  My husband went down with our sunscreen and pool gear before he left for his meetings everyday, tipped the pool guys $10 and got our chairs for the day in our chosen  spot.  My son and I then came out to the pool  after breakfast and left a few times during the day with no bother to our things.  They were very attentive with water, drinks, frozen washclothes and popsicles every afternoon.  There is virtually no beach, and what little there is has soaking waves all the way up to the public walkway by afternoon.  

As others have stated, there are quite a few security guards, dressed in hot black suits and  ties, all around.  I don't know if that much security is needed, but it gives you the illusion that it's a safe place.

All in all our stay was OK, and if we ever return to Honolulu (which I hope we don't), I would stay there again, as this seems to be the best of the choices.","Date of stay: August 2006","Trip type: Traveled on business","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

This hotel is an oasis of calm and elegance amidst the craziness of the Waikiki tourist maelstrom.  You need only walk the grounds of some of the adjacent hotels to understand why the Halekulani is tops among the hotels that Waikiki has to offer.  In contrast to its neighbors, the Halekulani is serene, and offers a peaceful getaway.

Granted, beyond the hotel's borders things can get noisy, with massive construction underway just across the street (thanks, Mr. Trump) and the public streaming by on the public walkway along the public beach (are you sensing a theme here?).  One can't possibly expect the Halekulani to be able to control these things, and to criticize based on negatives that are beyond the hotel's control seems horribly off base.

Our garden courtyard room afforded us the rest and relaxation we desired, and was equipped with every ammenity we could have hoped for.  It was incredibly peaceful, and the aforementioned construction did not intrude one bit.

The service was always excellent and cheerful, and the staff was incredibly attentive.  Dining and cocktail options were fantastic, particularly dinner at La Mer on our final night.

We spent a week there, and we were certainly sad to be leaving at week's end.  When we return to Oahu, there is absolutely no question in my mind that we will return to the Halekulani.

Yes the Halekulani could benefit from updating the interior of their rooms but the rest of the grounds, pool and lobby are gorgeous and the service was par excellence.

I stayed there for 5 days for a friend's birthday in June of this year. She and her two friends shared a Diamond Head Suite which was roomy, boasted three balconies and the most spectacular view of Diamond Head (please see attached pictures). Their suite's ample sitting area was furnished with two love seats and a chair, a wet bar and half-bath, entertainment center with CD player and TV. Of course I would have liked a 42"" plasma screen but we didn't go to Oahu to watch TV. Their bedroom was quite spacious and their bathroom was beautiful as was mine.

I had a Club Suite in their other building which had two balconies and almost as nice a view of Diamond Head. I too had a nice sitting area with the addition of a desk and chair right inside the door. The bathroom was spacious and everything was immaculately clean.

The hotel obviously caters to well-to-do Japanese tourists but I found the service to be gracious and spot-on with recommendations. In particular, Dee Dee at the concierge desk was exceptionally friendly, polite and most importantly, eminently knowledgeable about things to do and places to eat on Oahu.

Their lobby is gorgeous... Open and airy with oversized couches and chairs. Check in was done upstairs (which is always a classy move) and was effortless.

Yes there is a lot of construction going on but the noise never bothered any of us. Admittedly we were on the 'ocean side' of their property.

The one-way street leading to the hotel was often congested but we never waited longer than 2 or 3 minutes before we were waved through by one of the omnipresent traffic cops.

This was my first trip to Oahu (I have stayed on Maui the other 6-7 times I've been to Hawaii) and I knew what I was getting into. It is a big city. Cities have traffic and other inconveniences that one has to take as part of the package. 

I am leaving for Maui again the first week of September and am looking forward to being on an island where the most congested road is the two lane road from where we are staying in Wailea to Lahaina. Even then, you are driving along some of the most gorgeous coastline on the planet.

There is an ABC store a stone's throw from the lobby which was great for snacks and such.

All in all the Halekulani is indeed a world class hotel. Hopefully they will spruce up the decor in the rooms a bit but the rattan-esque furniture and neutral tones are appropriate for the island setting. The service is 5-star and breakfast at Orchids was one of the best meals we had during our stay. Didn't get to try La Mer but it comes very highly recommended.","Date of stay: June 2006","Trip type: Traveled with friends","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

However its important we touch on the pros. The rooms lovely, staff wonderful, indoor outdoor feel, fantastic with views of the ocean and Diamond Head ! We were at the Sheraton 1st with our kids. That was decent with the new rooms and very simple Sheraton standards. We did not like the same thing there as we are finding here. The beach area and surrounding us is  horrible! Construction everywhere. And at nite the streets right in front of our hotel, feel like ny alley ways at nite. What has happened to this place. It has a sense of danger, we saw someone in the water right out front screaming at a man on the beach going through his bag(homeless). Then a photographer from the Mai Tai who we found very aggressive and rude when we went for a sunset cruise, well now he was yelling at the poor guy who was the victim in the water!  So if you want a peaceful tranquil ocean, this is not for you , we found the beach people, surf instructors, mai tai , and alot of the people right outside this hotel to be very rude and hostile! I hope next year is better, we will not give up on the Halekulani, but I do think they need to clean up the surrounding areas, in means of crime, and comfort! There wasnt even room for us to sit on the tiny little beach due to all the surf boards and extremely rude surf instructor, he said he was Halekulani, we found out different , its a public beach and anyones allowed!

This was our second stay here and if you like under-stated but luxurious accommodations, then there is no place better in Hawaii than the Halekulani. The setting is like an oasis in the midst of the hustle and bustle of busy Waikiki.  Our requested ocean view room in the ""makai"" building afforded us a lovely view of the pool too - and what a pool it is! The rooms, like the rest of the property, are pristine, well appointed and extremely comfortable. The housekeeping services here are exemplary and they made certain that we had everything we needed, replenishing fresh ice, amenities, towels, robes, and sheets daily.  All of the food service outlets are superb as well. The breakfast buffet in House Without a Key was a feast each morning, meals at Orchids were terrific, room service was outstanding, and our celebratory dinner at La Mer was one we will never forget. 
The ambiance each and every day by the pool and small beach reminded us why we had come to Hawaii - to rest and relax without a care in the world. All of the poolside attendants work very hard to ensure that guests are happy and have everything they need. We were set up each morning in our desired location with towels, chaise covers, water, and magazines. Later, more water, drinks and food, cold hand towels, complimentary popsicles or ice cream, and fresh towels. 
When we return to Oahu in the future, we will of course stay at the Halekulani. Once you’ve stayed at one of the finest hotels in the world, why would you knowingly choose to stay anywhere else?","Date of stay: July 2006","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We told ourselves we would definitely stay here the next time we get a chance.  Our chance came last month and we booked to stay at Halekulani and as the hotel was full, the room rate was US$450 excluding taxes and breakfast per night.  Unfortunately when we checked in last month, we were escorted to a corner room to have the balcony facing the main road.  Construction works across the hotel was not only unsightly but extremely noisy, we had trouble getting sleep.  Moreover, a fight broke out from a nearby disco which resulted with 4 or 5 petrol cars closing in only at the end of the fight; it might have spilled onto the hotel lobby and even the lawn.  It would be disastrous if this had occurred, we thought how guests around the area would be taken care of.  It was at about 3 or 4 a.m. when this took place and many guests were at their hotel balconies checking out the commotion.  Fortunately, we only stayed 2 nights and moved to an apartment for the rest of our stay.  We definitely did not expect our good impression of the peace and tranquility to be so badly tarnished.

I just don't get the hype about this hotel. My husband and I chose to stay here last year based on rave reviews in travel magazines, and it was not our first trip to Hawaii. If it had been I doubt we would return. We are in our 40's and have stayed at some top-notch resorts, and as a senior executive he travels extensively. 

The hotel is in the midst of the hustle and bustle that is Honolulu/Waikiki. But my impression as we drove into the area is that it is NY with palm trees - traffic, noise, congestion.  Not at all what we expected. The hotel itself is peaceful, but the rooms and facilities are nothing special. Our room had a decent view but nothing compared to what we've had at other resorts in Hawaii. The pool area is OK, very little beach of its own, and the adjoining beaches/hotels are jam-packed. So when you're lying by the pool you get to listen to a constant parade of tourists  who make loud and often obnoxious comments as they walk by on the public beach walk right next to the pool area. You can't even see the ocean because of a row of hedges. Not at all what we had in mind. 

The service was very pleasant and efficient, but nothing better than we've had at less highly-rated hotels. 

I must honestly recommend that if you are considering a trip to Hawaii and are looking for its true natural beauty, serenity and culture, try the north coast of Kauai or Lanai. If you want action, people- watching and shopping on par with Rodeo Drive, then you'll love Waikiki.

Upon our arrival we found a lovely fruit platter, Halekulani chocolates and a complimentary, well-stocked refrigerator.

How does it get to be widely thought of as an upscale hotel? Is there some vast conspiracy going on here...? After reading all the enthusiastic reviews we expected something really special, along the lines of the Four Seasons or Mandarin Oriental, but the place is no better than your average 3 star Sheraton or Hilton - in fact I wish I'd stayed in one and saved my money. The famed service was nowhere in evidence, while both Orchids and House Without a Key were utterly ordinary. In fact the food at House Without a Key is truly second rate - clearly prepared in bulk and left on the side to be warmed up with heat lamps when something is ordered. My husband's steak was nearly stone cold. The whole place has an anonymous, colourless, dated feel about it, and a sense of conveyer belt too, with the constant procession of Japanese weddings and turnover of guests and diners. No one was actually nasty to us, don't get me wrong, but we might as well not have existed for all they cared. There is no sense of occasion or of feeling special, or like a valued guest here. Our partial ocean view room was also disappointing, and no way deserving of five star designation, with the wardrobe a cheap affair constructed of slats. The bathroom is beyond the wardrobe, and accessible through the wardrobe. It doesn't even have a proper door, just a rickety slatted screen that you pull across, and lock with difficulty. This means that you're not soundproof while in the bathroom, and that if you need the loo at night you can't put the light on, as it will disturb whoever is still in bed. It wasn't that much cheaper than the Four Seasons in Big Island, which was truly out of this world and truly deserving of the moniker of 'luxury hotel', living up to all our expectations.

We mentioned to the people at check-in that we were on our honeymoon, hoping that they'd give us a nice room.  We were placed on a first floor room right outside the swimming pool, not ideal for a honeymoon, as you would want a bit of privacy.  

We requested to be moved to another room.  We weren't impressed with the decor or the furnishings in the room either.  Everything is very outdated. This hotel needs to update and modernize all of it's decor, bathrooms, bedding, etc.  The public bathrooms in the hotel were in better condition than the rooms.

This is one expensive hotel, but is also simply the best.  The employees are all friendly and helpful and called us by name.   

For this trip we booked five nights in a Diamond Head Suite, which is roughly 1070 square feet in size, or two regular rooms put together.  The rate was $1450 plus tax (total around $1630).  Perhaps because we are repeat guests, the hotel gave us the best Diamond Head Suite in the place, room 1566, which is on the top floor and has a more private entrance, more private balcony and also extra ""sunset balcony"" on the side.  Short of staying in the $5,000-a-night Vera Wang or Royal Suites, this is the best room in the hotel.  The view of Diamond Head was spectacular.  All Diamond Head view rooms have similar views.

We had sent most of our luggage ahead of us to the hotel by FedEx and it was waiting for us in our room when we arrived.  The Halekulani had arrnaged to pick us up at the airport in a stretch limousine, and the car met us at the gate as we got off the plane.  Since we had no luggage to claim, we got into the car and were at the hotel quickly.  This was very nice. 

There is construction going on across the street from the hotel but it did not bother us.  The only things that bothered us were a few noisy kids around the pool (parents, control your kids please) and the woman in the room next to us who, early every morning, went out onto her balcony to make cell phone calls.  She spoke loudly and I'm sure bothered everyone within at least a 4-room radius with her loud cell phone voice.  We had to get up and close the door every morning when she started to talk/yell and could still hear her through the door.

Dining at LaMer and Orchids was wonderful (also very pricey). A massage at SpaHalekulani was great (and $$ at $250).

One of the chefs actually came out at the end of the meal and gave us dessert on the house for my parents' celebration.

It is one of the finest hotels in the US: If not the world. Service is the gold standard of a great hotel and this hotel is Fort Knox. 

First let me say that the Halekulani would be rated #1 if not for the disturbingly similar and scripted negative reviews dissing the Halekulani for noise, or a small beach or the decor then go on to say how the Kahala Oriental was better. I thibk there are some overzealous employees at the Kahala. 

Now, on to the Halekulani legendary service. On one visit I took the back of the house tour offered once a week. I discovered they control EVERY aspect of the operation, from the in house Swiss Chocolatier,  to Hotel printing, to the florists, to maintain total quality. Nothing is done outside of their oversight. I am still awed at the dedication  to total perfection.

One example:  Their turndown service is a two person operation that is as beautiful as ballet to watch. Two impeccably dressed and cheerfully polite housekeepers work together to completly refurbish every aspect of the room, everything restocked, cleaned and a different gift every night on the pillow. They do it quickly and seemingly effortlessly. Every employee seems so proud of his or her job and the Hotel they work for.  

The hotel rooms are understated, and subtly beautiful. Americans accustomed to the standard Hilton decor may feel cheated. They are also constantly being updated. On my last visit the A/V was updated and a new bedside control panel for all room functions had been added. Of course the best view in Waikiki is the correct focus of the room. 

Two of the best resturants in Oahu are here as well as the best Mai Tai and the best place to enjoy it are right downstairs. Once again the entertainment is authentic and wonderful. The hula is done right so don't expect any coconut bras.  Even if one does not stay here a Mai Tai and a sunset at the House Without a Key is as good as it gets. 

The grounds are impeccable, the pool is stunning, and the flower arrangements are the best this side of the Pacific. Guest security is a top priority as well. A gaggle of noisy punks was very quickly and efficiently dealt with on one visit. 

They do an amazing job of insulating guests from the Noise of Waikiki. Its like walking into a protected zone of serenity and peace. Even the elevators are super quick, and quiet. I never have to wait but a second or two. Its all these little things as well as the big ones that make this Hotel so fantastic. 

While it is expensive to stay they do not nickel and dime the guest, which I really appreciate. A Halekulani Key gets one into the Symphony, The Royal Palace Tour and other special cultural events for free. There are no: resort charges, valet parking charges, local phone charges or any other shenanigans. For 5 bucks they restockd the fridge with several drinks and snacks: The first are complimentary.  When the valet attendants saw us one morning with our snorkling equipment, towels, water, and sunblock were placed in the car without us even asking. God I love this place! 

If one has breakfast in the room a toaster arrives with room service and toast is seved piping hot. These people are fanatical about makeing the stay as perfect as possible. 

Take advantage of the packages always offered, they are a good deal. My favorite rooms are the Diamond Head view Club rooms.  They are very large corner rooms with two balconies, one facing Diamond Head and the pool, the other straight out to the ocean. There is another nice window seat as well. The bath is huge. However the standard rooms are excellent too. They are all the same except for their location (view) within the hotel. No one gets a bad room here. All have balconies. 

I could go on but I think I have made my point. This Hotel is truly unique and wonderful.","Date of stay: July 2005","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Service was beyond our expectations, all staff we encountered were friendly and went above and beyond to be helpful.  The hotel is beautiful and clean to perfection, and the security was like no other hotel/resort we've stayed at.  The hotel beach is extremely small, but connects to the public beach, so this was not an issue at all.  We will definitely stay again when we return to Oahu.  Our only negative comment would be the evening ""dress code"".  We were aware that all restaurants had a ""resort attire"" dress code (except for Le Mer which requires collared long sleeve shirt and jacket for men), but didn't realize that this meant long pants and closed toe shoes for men.  At every other hotel/resort we've stayed at, ""resort attire"" meant collared shirts and no jeans.  My husband didn't pack any long pants, just nice shorts and ""dress"" sandals, so we weren't able to dine at any of the hotel restaurants for dinner.  We had plenty of other options in the area, but would like to have known beforehand about the policy.

According to our waiter, it will continue until December 2006. I had almost booked this hotel and was glad I didn't.   My real review is regarding dinner.  While the service was 5 star, the dinner was less than I had anticipated.  We made a 30 minute drive just to eat there.  The appetizer course, salad and dessert were wonderful.

I enjoyed my time at the J.W. Marriot (formally the Ihillani Resort) much better. Rooms are very average, no cosmetic updates since we first went in 2000! My wife and I will only visit the Halekulani for Le Mer now when in Oahu. The best meal possible. We dropped over 200$ for dinner, but money never tasted sweeter. 5 diamond restaurant to a tee. The first time we ate there we actually learned alot about proper dining etiquette if 5 star restaurants. Little things like never use your napkin more than once or twice, turn you fork upside down on plate when finished so server knows your finished, expect a hot towel when returning from restroom, you'll get more than you order because they just kept bringing us samples of apps, entrees, and dessert, and I learned I don't like truffles no matter how much they cost! Overall save money by staying somewhere else, personally I think you should get away from Waikiki, and stay on more remote parts of the island, and stop in for a bite at Le Mer. You feel like royalty staying there because everyone knows how much it costs, but be the wiser and stay someplace less expensive and know you made the right decision.","Date of stay: August 2005","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

I was concerned about some of the reviews I read but soon found out that those people must have been staying somewhere else.  The Halekulani is just magnificent.  From the minute we walked in the staff was extremely attentive.  
  The in room check-in is great and we got a great tour of the property.  The staff could not have been any more helpful.  The concierge desk was most helpful in arranging transportation for us and getting reservations at good resturants.  
 We booked 2 rooms ( one for the kids ) and were hoping they would be connecting.  Soon found out they don't have connecting rooms, but what we had was better.  There was a seperate door from the hallway that you could close ( almost like a foyer ) and that allowed us to keep our room doors open.  It was very much like having a large suite. 
  We also found the rooms to be quite lovely.  All white and very elegant.  The bathrooms are perfect.  Very large.  A somewhat small shower but the great water pressure more than made up for the size.
   We loved the beautiful grounds and landscaping.  Also loved the pool.  Was plenty large enough for the ones who wanted to swim.  Pool side service was also very attentive.
  On the night before we had to leave, we had several wet items and I didn't want to pack them so I phoned the front desk to ask if there was a place I could dry my items.  They immediately sent someone from laundry services to collect my things.  Two hours later they returned my items dryed, folded, and packed neatly in boxes.  Needless to say I was impressed.
  Room service is also top notch.  We ate dinner in our rooms the last night and everything was delicious and served quite quickly. And all of the above was done with a smile.
   I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to be treated like royalty for just a little while.","Date of stay: April 2006","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

From the moment we stepped out of our limo we had the best service.  We had an awesome view of the ocean.  Room 1006, make sure you request it.  We were a little disappointed that the room wasn't a little more updated but it was very clean.  The other thing we didnt like was the area in which you actually went to the bathroom, it was very small.  My husband is a big guy and they just dont give you any room to move around.  The robes were great.  We had the breakfast buffet everyday at the house w/o a key and it was awesome.  We usually only ate a late breakfast and early dinner. I gotta say that the Cheesecake Factory is a must if you go to Honolulu.  It was really nice to be at a place where there wasn't a ton of people.  The beaches were packed so it was nice to be kind of secluded from all that at this property.  The beach isnt very big so if you're looking for that you will be disappointed.  The pool was awesome!! The water temp was perfect.  We experienced alot of rain during our stay here so that definitley put a damper on things.

Sadly, we found the experience to be lackluster and ordinary. Service here can't be beat--an A+ to the staff!However, the rooms and overall appearance of the resort are beginning to lose their luster, and this diamond needs to be buffed and shined, especially for what they are charging.The rooms are only average in appearance, and they look as thought they have not been updated since the resort opened.

We enjoyed it as much as the first time, despite pretty lousy weather (flooding on Oahu, just our luck). I'll just point out a few things not mentioned as much: One cool thing is, the security. You feel pretty well taken care of. They have discrete security personnel everywhere (they're the only people in Hawaii with black suits and ties on).
True the beach is non-existent. But if you've been to Waikiki, you know that trying to sit on the beach ANYWHERE is pretty miserable...too many people on the beach and too many people walking up and down the beach. So, I say, lie by the Halekulani's beautiful pool and take a dip in the ocean as you please.
The ""in room check in"" is a nice touch. In fact, the whole place runs like a well oiled machine.
Le Mer, the 5 star French restaurant on property, is great but really expensive. I'd go for a special occasion, but you don't want to eat the just 'cuz your hungry :).
Even if you don't stay, go to the nightly entertainment show and enjoy the sunset with a Mai Tai.

The service there was nothing short of amazing.   Quick, efficient and kind.  They upgraded the room to the ocean front suite, and did a great job of showing the room.  The valet service was even quick, and that is fairly rare in Hawaii.     

The room seemed a bit drab.  Great bathroom.  Nice pillows on the bed.  Everything else was just so so.  Standard hotel furniture, kitchenette, carpet, decorations etc etc.  Not bad at all, but not what I consider a 5 star suite.   No coffee machine kind of meant you were going to be gouged for their so-so breakfast.

Orchids restaurant was slightly better than a $6 L&L  plate lunch, which needless to say was overpriced for Hawaii.  The pool was small, the beach was non-existent and the fact that people were walking on a cement walkway above you really didn't make you feel like you were on the ocean.   You could go to a more public beach next door, but then why stay at this hotel?  Might as well pay $250 bucks less and stay at the Outrigger next door. 

So, I guess what I'm saying is I wouldn't stay here again.  Its a good hotel, the people are great, the rooms have their good points, but its not really worth the money.

Oh yeah, I'll repeat what has been said before.  If you have a chance to go to Leonard's bakery, DO IT!  We just stumbled on it since it was next to the L&L.  Just amazing.....","Date of stay: February 2006","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

When I arrived all my worries went away. The hotel was beautiful, and we were upgraded to huge 1600 sq ft ocean view suite. The spa was incredible and I would highly recommend the splurge on a massage. There definitely was some construction near the hotel but I was not bothered by it once. My favorite part was after a day in the sun, coming up to the room, opening all the doors and listening to the hawaiian band play music while the sun went down. 

The beach is very small in front of the hotel but if you walk another 20 ft you are in front of the main beach which provides chairs for rent. I would definitley still consider it a beach front hotel, it is just at the end of the beach.  

I had read a review complaining about a Dennys being directly across the street from the hotel. This was my first time in Oahu but I have to laugh now. IT IS A CITY! Or course there is going to be Dennys and McDonalds everywhere.

Perhaps this was not an ideal time to visit, given the construction happening for the beach walk project--very noisy, lots of dust, and a maze of traffic diversions, but we were not dazzled by the property. The hotel is nice, in a subdued sort of way, but not outstandling, and certainly not worth a special trip to visit. For us, it wasn't an ""experience"" event, as others have posted, but rather just an expensive hotel which trades on its name and location. We have had better stays at the Kahala Mandarin Oriental, Sheraton Royal Hawaiian (historic wing), even the Hilton Hawaiian Village (alii tower) and the Hyatt Regency Waikiki (regency club level). Granted, the rooms do have beautiful views, but they are also dated and worn,and very much in need of an update. My wife is an interior designer, and she found the decor to be dull and bland, rather than the haven of luxury that the guide books and publications would lead you to believe. The famous tiled orchid pool is beautiful, but far too small for the resort, and the few grains of sand that appear in front of the property at low tide, along the sea wall, don't really qualify as being called a beach. Also, the shrubs along the seawall do obscure the ocean view from the pool area. In all fairness, the real highpoint of the Halekulani is service, and this you can count on. They are not snooty and highbrow like some luxury resorts, and they're not in your face nickel and diming you at every turn. My bottom line is value for dollar. If you can get a discounted package at the Halekulani (and, they do exist), then by all means give it a try. But just be aware that there are equally fine alternatives available along the Waikiki strip.","Date of stay: January 2006","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

We first stayed at the Mandarin Oriental where we were treated to a very nice upgrade to a huge room! Then we flew to Maui and stayed at the Hyatt which was nice. Then on our way back home we stayed at the Halekulani since I had read so much about it and really wanted to try it out. 

Let me start by saying that the staff could not have been nicer. They walked us to our room and were very gracious. However, I was not that impressed with the rooms. They were just stark white rooms that were in ok condition. We were a bit spoiled by that time and were sad we did not get an upgrade(but we did and should not have expected it). We were just spoiled by the Mandarin Oriental! I was also sad when they would not extend our checkout even a little.

The interior of the hotel and lobby was very beautiful! We had breakfast at Orchids and I was not that impressed. Breakfast at the Mandarin was much better. 

Additionally, the Halekulani was about $100 more expensive for a room that did not compare to the Mandarin! All in all I was sad we wasted the almost $500 to stay in a non-oceanfront room that was not that impressive. 

I have stayed at many 5 star hotels and I think this was the least impressive of them all. If and when I go back I will defnitely stay at the Mandarin Oriental away from the hustle and Bustle of Waikiki!

One final tip. If you have a chance go to Leonard's bakery and have the malasadas!!! It is the best donut type dessert I have ever had. A very nice woman raised in Oahu told my husband and I about it. It was one of the highlights of my trip! They cook it to order.

The hotel is beautiful and we had a Diamond Head view room during our 9/29/05 to 10/4/05 stay.  Waking up to Diamond Head was truly a treat and our room also overlooked the pool/outside lounge area so most nights we enjoyed Hawaiian music from below.  I can't say enough wonderful things about the staff - starting from when I made our room reservation, to emailing them about a rental car and brunch reservations.  Make sure if you are celebrating a special occasion, let them know - the hotel manager treated us to a bottle of champagne in honor of our anniversary.  Other special touches are the treats in your room upon check-in, the free tickets we enjoyed to the Bishop Museum, and the beach towels, bottled water and umbrellas (yes, it rains in paradise) they made sure we had everytime we left the hotel for a drive/walk.  The only negative about this hotel is the nearby construction.  It made it difficult to get around the hotel (driving and walking) and the noise at times when we were sitting on our lanai was horrible.

We're here for about the 12th time (over the course of nearly 2 decades); this time for part business and part pleasure.

Service: just the best combination of professionalism and genuine hospitality. Swift, efficient but gracious service. Love the crisp white aprons on the friendly room staff! Everyone does their best even with the occasional inappropriately arrogant demanding guest.

Guests: majority are Asian though not just Japanese anymore - quite a few Mandarin, Cantonese and Korean speaking folks; plus North Americans, a few Western Europeans/Russians. This is not a tour group kind of place, so everyone (couples, families) is on their own or just in small groups. Security does a good, discreet job of keeping the grounds (beyond restaurants) ""guests only.""

Business: Complimentary wifi, superb business office staff support and prompt (immediate!) delivery of documents dropped off by associates at the front desk. I love the outdoor wall outlet on the terrace, so I can (and currently am) using my laptop outside in the tropical breeze with fab views.

Room: all rooms are the same size and layout with pricing according to view and placement; with suites of course being larger - the hotel's website lists s.f. for all suite types as well as placements; the guestrooms are all about 500 s.f. and very well planned. We're in a 9th floor Ocean Front room - with stunning head on ocean views from inside the room as well as from the terrace. For the price, I think the Diamond Head Ocean front and the Ocean view rooms are the ""best buys"" - the DHOF are the most expensive but the views are the best plus you are most distant from other rooms and their balconies. The OV rooms have terrific ocean views from balconies (not necessarily from inside the rooms). Rooms have small refrigs that are NOT filled with expensive minibar items - just a few complimentary soft drinks. Since there are numerous ABC stores just steps away, it's easy to fill it up with your own purchases, or ask the hotel to fill it with whatever you wish. Morning and evening maid service is efficient, with just the friendliest staff.

Pleasure: I find the oval pool sufficiently large - it's at least 20, maybe 25 yards in length and at least 10 yards wide, with temp around 85-87F (best guess) in December. Most people just take dips, kids are mostly well behaved, and yes there are lap swimmers but they are mostly present in the early mornings or late afternoons - they don't want to be bothered by waders just as much as the waders don't want to be bothered by lap swimmers! The ocean is perfect for ""laps"" parallel to the beach - just 25 yards out or so it's deep and clear enough of surfers and waders - saw a huge sea turtle swim under me yesterday! Yes the sandy portion of beach is tiny right in front of the hotel, but as Hawaiian beaches are all public property up to the high tide water line plus x more yards, there is plenty of room on sandy beach just about 5 yards towards Diamond Head. We hang out at the pool or early or late, so never a problem with prime loungers, but mid day most seem taken. So if it's really important to you to get a good spot for all day basting/roasting, get down there by 7:30 am or so - you won't be alone! And despite the ""no reservations"" policy, they will let you keep your stuff there if you're gone for reasonable amounts of time (like for lunch or whatever).

F&B: All venues are excellent and sometimes superb in terms of both service and food. Good range from the very casual to the formal (at least Hawaiian style formal - meaning long sleeves!). Last night I needed a quiet place to have a private conversation over a light dinner, and the waitstaff at the Lewers Lounge very happily provided us with a secluded table, and items off menu - so we got exactly what we wanted. Two days ago we needed an urgent last minute breakfast, and they came through perfectly. Room service is exemplary.

Noise: though there is a huge multi-block construction project happening just behind the hotel, we've not heard a single jackhammer or crash or anything at all from our room or terrace - though we are in the most ""protected"" part of the hotel - surrounding the pool.

Location: it's really a comparatively serene oasis in the middle of one of the densest, tourist areas in the US (Waikiki Beach). For shopaholics, all the glam international retailers (Cartier, Hermes, Prada, LV, Tiffany etc) have branches within a few blocks. For those who are not above public transportation, it's just about 200 yards to the bus stop, and a $2 air con bus ride (#8, 19 or 20) to Ala Moana (for those who want supermarket or food court relief from hotel dining, or just need even more retail therapy).

Overall: This is a fabulous place. Remember it is a city resort hotel, not an outer island country resort, so don't expect vast acreage of golf course, beaches and semiprivate villa accommodations. The massive concrete Sheraton is right next door, though if you don't look up you can pretend not to see it! It is worth every hundred or thousand dollar bill you spend here - of course it's expensive, but for comparative pricing for luxury accommodations in Hawaii, this is the place to be. (Just try a Marriott/Hilton/Sheraton in Honolulu and you'll see!) You really get what you pay for (for US pricing I mean - of course you would get more if you paid the same in Bali or Singapore). It's amazing that the hotel and staff are doing so well during this full house peak week of peak season! My only wish is that the bathrooms of the (regular) guest rooms had double sinks - I know, I know we could have paid more for a suite with more than one bathrooms.

About us: I think it's always important to know about the writer to assess reviews appropriately: Our favorites are Amanresorts, Peninsula Hotels (eg exec suite Chicago), MO BKK (dlx suite), the Meurice (jr suite) and Singita (anything!), middle aged cosmopolitan American professional couple (not travel industry but wish we had their discounts!), no kids, willing to splurge but love deals and efficient/ friendly service, hate waste and culturally inappropriate glitz (chandeliers and gilt are perfect for Paris palace hotels, not ok in the tropics).","Date of stay: December 2005","Trip type: Traveled on business","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I really just wanted to let people know what to expect, as my husband and I were surprised and disappointed when we showed up.

My husband and I had been to the Four Seasons Maui a number of times, and though we couldn't imagine anything better, the reviews here as well as the Conde Nast Traveler Gold List convinced us to try something different.  

If you have never been to Honolulu, know that it (unlike Wailea in Maui) is a very crowded, way overcommercialized big city.  I'm all about the big city experience in New York or San Francisco, but I fly the 8+ hours to Hawaii to relax! The traffic from the airport was horrendous.  When we finally got to the hotel, we were stunned to see that the hotel is in the middle of a chaotic scene of stores and restaurants, including a Denny's directly across the street from the main entrance.

I can't remember the specific room category, but it was a full ocean view room, and in that sense it did not disappoint.  The view of the ocean was simply beautiful, not only from the balcony but from almost anywhere in the room.  The room was reasonably sized and seemed to be pretty clean.  I wouldn't call it luxurious by any stretch, and it seemed like it could use a little updating.  The toiletries were nice - I think they were made just for the hotel so I don't know the brand but they had nice Hawaiian type scents (orchid, maybe?)

The pool was small and I don't understand why everyone goes nuts about the orchid in the pool. I didn't think it was all that interesting.  

Now on to the bad part.  The beach.  Oh wait, there is no beach!!! This is supposedly a five star hotel ON THE BEACH in Hawaii, and there is a tiny tiny sliver of public beach (I'm not kidding, it can't even be 50 ft.) that fronts the hotel property.  That means no food, beverage, chair or umbrella service at the beach (you'd be lucky if you could find somewhere to lay your towel), and you have to share it with everyone else on earth that also wants to enjoy Waikiki Beach . . . babies wearing only diapers, screaming kids, cheesy singles trying to find a hookup, etc.  Not my idea of relaxation.

Breakfast was just mediocre, not a very wide selection at the buffet and the service was pretty poor.  Everywhere you go by foot or by car near the hotel is clogged with people, cars, and long waits for everything.  After less than 24 hours there, we decided we couldn't bear to spend 7 days there, so we booked a flight to Maui for that afternoon.

I would say if you want to be in the middle of it all, and want the big city experience - great shopping, a large selection of restaurants - and don't mind big crowds (especially on the beach), this is probably a pretty good place to stay.  However, if your idea of vacation is relaxing under palm trees with a gentle breeze in relative quiet, with terrific food, golf, and high end shops, try the Four Seasons Maui at Wailea.  It's a little more expensive but worth every last penny.","Date of stay: March 2004","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

We woke each morning to views of Diamond Head and 100+ surfers in the ocean, plus the beautiful pool with the orchid design.  

The rooms are lovely, and the service is impeccable in every department from concierge, to reception, to dining, to poolside.

My husband and I enjoyed every amenity offered here but we would not recommend this hotel for families (we were very happy not to have our children with us . . . we would have been ""shushing"" them all week).

Why? Let me explain. 

We flew into Honolulu from the Big Island at 11:23a.m. Our return flight to the mainland wasn't until 10:45p.m. The airlines refused to check our luggage through since it was more than 6 hours. I called Halekulani, where I had booked dinner reservations at 6p.m. and asked if they could store our luggage for the day. Absolutely! When we arrived, our luggage was quickly dispatched to storage, our rental car was valet parked and we were cordially greeted and made to feel welcome.

We ended up having lunch at House Without a Key...wonderful. We had a chat with the Asst. Mgr. for Food and Beverage (a charming man named Paul) and he confirmed our reservation for 6p.m. and promised us a wonderful outdoor table to watch the sunset. 

We went shopping for a while and returned to House Without a Key to watch the Hawaiian trio that sang classical Hawaiian songs. They were wonderful and we found that our lemonades had been comped.

Our dinner at Orchids was wonderful. Our server greeted us by name, the night asst. mgr. came by to greet us and our meal was fabulous. They even comped our desserts! 

When we went to pick up our baggage and our car, we had three people scurrying about to make it all happen smoothly. 

Now where do you think that we'll stay in our next trip to Honolulu? Halekulani, of course!!! This is Aloha Spirit at its best. 5 Stars. No Question about it.","null","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We spent two days at a budgety hotel and then stayed 4 days at the Halekulani, where we also had our reception. All I can say is that it was fabulous.

No, there's not much in the way of beach, but the grounds are beautiful, the pool is amazing and the restaurants are wondreful. And the bathroom is probably the best hotel bathroom I've ever seen.

When we arrived we inquired about upgrading to a suite, but the hotel was fairly booked an the desk told us we'd end up paying more for something not much better, so we stayed with a standard room and it was great. Plenty of room for me to get into my dress--even with 5 people around. 

Our reception, which we had on the Hau Terrace, was beyond our expectations. Our guests couldn't stop exclaiming about the view, the wonderful drinks and the best wedding food they've ever had.

Yes, it's pricey. But for a once-in-a-lifetime event it was worth it.

Unfortunately, when it was time to leave and go to the Big Island, the hotel there was a huge let down. When I make it back to Waikiki I will definitely stay here again!","Date of stay: October 2005","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I just got back!","I expected more.  The hotel staff was excellent and catered to every need in a prompt manner.  The hotel grounds were immaculate.  But problems came about when I saw the pool.  I expected it to be bigger.  It was small for such a large hotel.  And why are people trying to do laps in a public leisure pool that is too small and crowded?  The drinks were overpriced (expect that from any resort/hotel in Hawaii).  But the drinks were VERY good and once the waiter noticed that we wanted them a bit stiff (we ARE on vacation) he accommodated with no extra charge.  Great tip for that guy!  KIDS!!  EVERYWHERE!!  They invaded the pool ten at a time and were loud and obnoxious.  No one from the staff asked them to be quiet.  I still think this is the job of the parents.  Five hundred bucks a night is a little too much to pay for listening to kids all day at the pool.  I would have gone to the beach, but it was so small that it wasn't worth it.  Besides, I wanted a waiter to bring me drinks all day, isn't that what I was paying for in such a resort/hotel?  The spa was great.  They were late for our couples massage.  But it was worth the wait!  Maybe a bit overpriced?  The room itself was lackluster.  It was nice with all the amenities.  I liked that the toilet had a door to separate it from the rest of the bathroom.  Couples will love this feature after sampling the hotel's restaurants.  House Without a Key is horrible.  Don't eat there unless it is for the excellent breakfast buffet.  The other two, La Mer, and Orchid, were excellent.  Go to Orchid's at 5:30 when it opens, order some champagne and watch the sunset before you eat a very nice meal.  Get the fish, you are on an island.  Don't stay in the hotel during the day, the kids will not make it a relaxing time.  Instead, go diving, fishing, go to the big island for a day trip (take a helicopter tour over the volcanos), go on a Circle Island Tour (ask for Johnny at Platinum Limousine, tell him that the girl from North Carolina sent you, he will take you on a truly memorable ride).  AAA Diving is a great dive company in Oahu, they operate a good dive boat (I have been diving all over the world, certified as Divemaster, so I know a good dive boat).  Alex, the head honcho at AAA knows his stuff, but he might be a little crazy (or is he just British?).  

Look, all in all, I could have stayed anywhere and had just as much fun because I was out experiencing the islands.  But I did pay for comfort and I expected more from Halekulani.  Especially for what they are charging.  I think I will stick with the Four Seasons next time.  They have been consistently good around the world.","null","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

We spent an utterly perfect 4 nights at the hotel and despite our high expectations, they were constantly surpassed during our stay.
Firstly, when we arrived, we were warmly greeted by the staff and escorted to our room to check in. We had an ocean view room on 15th floor and the view was just stunning. The room itself, we found to be very spacious, light, spotlessly clean and extremely well maintained. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was lovely, particularly the seperate shower and bathrobes which are essential in any luxury hotel. The complimentary mineral water, fruit and chocolates are exactly the kind of small joy welcomed after a long journey.
The turndown service was done with care and a lovely touch. It was always fun to come back to the room and find what little gift and message had been left on the bed.
Myself and my husband were celebrating our wedding anniversary whilst we were there and the hotel staff went out of their way to make it special. On our first night, we had gone out for a walk on the beach and returned to find a note congratulating us on our anniversary with a complimentary bottle of champagne. It was very unexpected and a real pleasure.
We ate at Orchids for both breakfast and dinner and both, were superb. In particular, dinner was sublime. We were greeted with a ""Congratulations"" as we were seated (on an ocean front table, as we'd requested) and someone came and took our photo. We thought nothing of it until front desk rang later to ask us to collect our photo. They had actually made it into an anniversary card with a personalised, hand-written design and message! We have never been to a hotel that would go out of their way like that, and very much doubt that many others exist. The meal itself was amazing. We started with scallops and crab cakes, both of which were wonderfully prepared and presented. We then followed with duck and lobster and I can honestly say that I've never tasted lobster like that in my life. We finished with the famed coconut cake and absolutely agree with everyone that raved about it!
We also ate at another of the hotel's restaurants, La Mer which I can only describe as out of this world. I know some people are put off by the fact the dress code is a little more formal but it didn't feel stuffy at all. Once again, we were congratulated on our anniversary as we were seated (again, at an ocean front table as requested) and offered complimentary flutes of champagne and hors d'oeuvres. The service was unparalleled. There is a high staff to customer ratio and although someone was always on hand should we have needed anything, we never felt like we were being watched all the time. The staff there were obviously very experienced and we were recommended a superb wine to accompany our meal. The food was absolutely exquisite. We started with foie gras and scallops, followed by Kobe-style fillet of beef and duck and ended with coconut souffle which were all faultless. The portions were not huge but seemed to be just right. After we had our souffle and complimentary handmade chocolates by the hotel's chocolatier, the waiter brought over a chocolate cake with a lit candle in it, to celebrate our anniversary! With the service shown by all of the staff at the hotel, it felt more like an anniversary weekend!
I took advantage of the hotel's spa for part of a day and enjoyed every self-indulgent minute. I had booked the Grand Voyage package which included a massage of my choice (chose Polynesian Nonu which is easily the best massage I've ever had), Just for You personalised facial (really sorted out my skin) and luxury manicure and pedicure which were fantastic. The spa staff were all extremely friendly but professional. Midway through the package, I was served a superb Ahi tuna salad and juice for lunch outside on a sun lounger and at that moment, I just felt that life couldn't get any better.

The location of the hotel we found to be excellent. It was our first visit to Honolulu/Waikiki and found most things that we wanted to do were in very easy reach. We only noticed the construction work when we set foot outside of the hotel. It literally never bothered us for a second when we were inside.

We had pre-booked a few excursions with the concierge at the hotel and all of the paperwork and conformations needed were all ready for us when we arrived. Everything went very smoothly with that.

The staff in general, were all fantastic. Every single one of them deserves a big pat on the back in our opinion. From the restaurant staff, to the front desk, to the spa staff and even the bellhops who always greeted us warmly when we arrived back at the hotel from a day out and asked if we'd had a nice day, each one of them made you feel like pleasing you was all that mattered and that is truly what service at a luxury hotel should be like.

Next time we return to Honolulu, we won't even be contemplating staying anywhere else but at Halekulani.","Date of stay: November 2005","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

I am glad we stayed here first before we stayed at the Four Seasons due to the difference in room size and bathroom size only.  This hotel is beautifully maintained.  The staff is top notch.  My only ""complaint"" would be the beach, but we were so busy with going to downtown Waikiki beach and walking to Diamond head, seeing Pearl Harbor, that we barely had time to go to the beach.  We used the lounge chairs just outside the beach on the days we hung out at the hotel for a little R&R.  It was wonderful.  The staff could not be more helpful and polite.  Our room faced the ocean directly on the 12th floor.  Every evening we could watch the hula dancer or entertainment from our balcony.  The first evening we were so tired from traveling that we had room service on the balcony and then headed straight to bed.  Room service out there is a delight.  The room is small, but laid out very well.  They have wonderful food at their restaurants. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet every day.  This hotel is highly recommended, since it is in the fun section of Waikiki beach, so you can walk to so many places.  We were not bothered by noise from the nearby construction at all.

These were my final thoughts as I left what I feel is now my ""home away from home"".  

I didn't initally feel quite like this....from my initial transport to the hotel, I noticed the construction that was going on down the street from the hotel and thought - oh no.  We checked in at the front desk to find only smiles...slowly I began to forget about the construction.  Then they told us we were going to be escorted to our room for a ""private in-room check-in""!  A young gentleman, Frank, escorted us to our room and gave us a private tour of the entire property.  He gave us a full history of the hotel and answered all of my husbands questions (which is difficult, trust me, I know).  

In the room we registered and recieved our breakfast vouchers; we booked the Sunrise package Diamond Head View.  Our room at first was on a lower floor (six) so I did mention that I wouldnt mind being higher.  Frank quickly made a phone call, and before I knew it we were being taken to the room of our dreams!  It was on the 15th floor!  Later I found out it was a young lady named Donna, who reassigned our room, no questions asked just marvolus service! So if you have any problems, these two are a great team! 

After check in, my husband and I went down by the pool for a swim.  The attendents were very nice and prompt with getting us pool chaise lounges.  You cannot order food by the poolside, but you can have refreshments. I recommend the mint-iced lemonade...its refreshing under the sun.  The pool is amazingly beautiful and very clean! 

I wanted some reading magazines so I went to the little shop in the hotel.  Usually these shops are overstocked with very pushy sales associates, but there I met wonderful lady who is just a peach! She helped me find everything I wanted!

For dinner, we dined at Orchids which was our favorite.  The crab cakes are to die for, as well as the coconut cake!  Those are a must!  We had the oppertunity to meet the chef, Daryl Fujimoto was his name...such a wonderful ""food magician"" as I called him.  

Our vacation was truley heavenly.  I learned that Halekulani means ""house befitting heaven"" and that is just what it is.

After returning from our stay at the Fairmont Kea Lani hotel in Maui, this hotel was a disappointment.  For a honeymooning couple, it was not everything I imagined, and paled in comparison to the Fairmont.

Hopefully I can add a few additional details based on my recent five-night stay with my wife and infant son, which for the sake of comparison included: a Diamond Head room (generously sized, great bathroom), daily breakfast (never tried Orchids, everything we wanted and more was at the excellent buffet), dinner at LaMer that the hotel graciously changed to Orchids (excellent food, but the only hint of mediocre service we received our entire stay from one particular server) and two spa treatments (excellent--again).  

To begin with, the Halekulani has over 400 rooms, which on the surface is quite a few, based on the fact that they market themselves as an oasis of tranquility, etc.  However, when you realize that all of the other major hotels in the area have 700+ rooms within two massive towers, the Halekulani seems small and quaint.  Amid the bustle of Waikiki it is the ONLY slice of tranquility.

To be honest, initially the room did not knock our socks off.  While everything was in excellent working order some items appeared to be dated, for example the room control console next to the bed.  However, after a day everything began to grow on us, even the control console turned out to be a very effective and appreciated room amenity. By the end the decor seemed to fit the property and we were very sad to leave both.

What set the Halekulani above and beyond in our opinion was the service, on par or better than all of the great resorts in the world we have had the privilege to visit.  While veryone we came in contact with may not have been the most polished all were warm and gracious, always looking to please.

Would highly recommend staying over a Wednesday night to take part in the Managers' Reception.  Great drinks and appetizers for an hour, waiters with Mai-Tais greeting you upon entry, but you can order anything within reason from the bar. 

We stayed at the Surfrider for a night and aside from the lei and mango-iced tea upon registration it was an average nice/OK stay, definitely not luxe though.  

If you do pay for a Diamond Head room I would highly recommend requesting a room on the tenth floor or higher, we were initially given a room on the sixth floor and the rooftop of LaMer occupied the entire foreground of our view while on the balcony.

The Halekulani, Royal Hawaiian, the three Sheraton properties (obviously including the Moana Surfrider) are all Japanese owned (as I am sure many other hotels in Waikiki are).  Therefore, if for some reason one has an aversion to tourists from Asia, I would not recommend coming to Honolulu or even Oahu period.   

The one and only reason we would ever return to Waikiki again is the Halekulani, we personally prefer quieter locales and therefore did not enjoy Honolulu at all.  That being said we will be back.

I have very high expectations when it comes to fine hotels such as the Halekulani.  They lived up to every one of them. 
Yes, there is construction on Lewers and BeachWalk (my biggest worry prior to my trip)but it didn't really bother me and it wasn't as offensive as I thought it would be.  Once you're in the Halekulani you aren't aware of it and you just forget about it.
Location of the Halekulani was great we were close to everything.   
The moment you arrive people greet you so warmly.  You are checked in at your room, which is beautiful.  I had a garden view on the first floor opening up onto the lawn area of the pool.  I loved it! The bed was so very comfortable and the amenities excellent. Great bedding!  Extremely quiet hotel if you are a light sleeper, we never even heard another guestroom's door closing.  
The pool was wonderful.  The pool service excellent- the gentlemen who work the pool set you up wherever you want to sit.  The beverage service was slow at times in reaching you to take your order- depending on where you sat. Once they received your order the service was prompt. 
The beach was small but I actually loved that.  
The security staff are very discreet, they really do look like secret service.  
We had breakfast included with our package and each time it was wonderful.  I do recommend having breakfast at Orchids. Food was wonderful and if you are on a special diet as my family members were they were better able to accomodate you there. Although I must admit House Without a Key's buffet breakfast came through with egg beater omelet for my husband.  They really do know how to make you feel pampered at both restaurants.  Orchids was off their game a bit on ourlast day, but they were so gracious when they acknowledged they were having difficulties that we just forgot about it. 
People with sweet tooths: I highly recommend the Halekulani coconut cake and the Chocolate Dreams Martini from Lewers Lounge. Spectacular!
Halekulani really has excellent service, most especilly the concierge staff.  I cannot say enough about all the wonderful staff members, they are what make you feel so well taken care of there.  They are truly extraordinary people!
House Without a Key is an oasis in the evenings.  The food was so good at the hotel I never wanted to go eat anywhere else- why bother, great food accompanied by wonderful soft happy peaceful music with hula dancing.  What more could you want!
Yes, there can be more than one celebrity sighting and you can suddenly find yourself sitting in a lounge chair next to one,as I did most of our time there.It was fun yet made me uncomfortable when I wanted to take pictures of the hotel or my family- I didn't want them thinking that I was snapping pictures of them while they were enjoying their private time there.  So I put the camara away when one appeared.  I felt it was the respectful thing to do.  
If you like to workout, I recommend the treadmills in the fitness center as they have a beautiful view of the pool and diamond head while you work out. 
All in all- it was spectacular!  So wonderful and special.  My family who joined me on this trip agreed.  It is an oasis in the middle of waikiki beach, you feel like you're somewhere different until you step outside of the hotel.  
I know this....... I will only stay at the Halekulani when I return to Oahu!","Date of stay: October 2005","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The $2,375.00 price tag was very well worth it.  That price was well below what you would normally pay for the package I won.  

First I'll describe my package:  (5) nights Diamond Head Ocean front Room (10 floor, 1061) awesome, awesome view. You could see Diamond Head & Waikiki Beach while taking a shower through the sliding closet doors, WOW!  Full Breakfast every morning at either the buffet (House without a key), or sitdown al la carte at (Orchids, my choice).  The breakfast includes everthing from steak and eggs, to japanese style (to healthy for me) breakfast.  All taxes & gratuities are included, the staff doesn't even give you a bill.  Dinner for two at La Mer: (Chef's Menu) which they were kind enough to substitute a couple of choices at no charge.  La Mer is top notch, gentlemen wear a jacket and be ready to romance your lady.
(2) 75 minute spa experiences, I choose the NONU treatment: UNBELIEVABLE!  Service at the spa is fantastic, it's cozy and the aroma's are fantastic! we also received refreshments before, and after treatment and a spa gift set.  Comp's to the Honolulu arts & cultural centers, Daily newspaper, free local calls, and complimentary wireless internet service. (the wireless service alone is usually $9.95 a day at other high line properties).

That's the package, now my other observations.  The property itself is immaculate, a block away from the main shopping strip, and right on the beach.  Yes, there's construction right down the block, but after a day or too your mind blocks it out.  Service is five star, check in is in your room.  There's live daily entertainment at House w/o key, nice spot to watch the sunset.  There's a path that runs between the property and the beach, where the unlucky ones get to admire you hanging out at the Halekulani, and believe me they will..lol.  Security is omnipresent, but very discreet & professional.  The food at every restaurant was very good, and fresh.  The drinks were reasonably priced.  The pool/beach area can get a little crowded, but the pool attendants are more than accommodating and drink service was quick (no food at the pool).

Our room was a ""partial ocean view"", and if there's one thing you can say about this hotel, they are honest about the view descriptions.  It was partial, as you could see it only from the balcony.  However, I had stayed at the Marriott Waikiki Beach Resort just days earlier in an ""ocean view deluxe"" room, which also had a view of the ocean only from the balcony.  We very much dislike hotels that do that.  
The room was gorgeous, as always, with fresh flowers, a fruit platter including two yummy papayas, and a box of handmade chocolates.  The refrigerator was stocked with 4 bottles of water and 2 bottles of juice, all complementary (and plenty for our one-night stay).
A previous post mentioned construction noise--I stayed during the week and didn't hear any--and the previous poster neglected to mention that it isn't the Halekulani that's engaged in the construction; rather it's the two hotels behind it.  Also, I'm baffled by his breakfast experience:  there are two options--the House Without a Key has a buffet, while Orchids has an a la carte menu.  He certainly had the choice of going to Orchids.  We did the breakfast package, or the ""Sunrise Package"", so we had the buffet included in our room price.
Admittedly, the room prices are not cheap, but I think it is worth the extra price for what you get--seclusion, relative quiet away from Waikiki, outstanding service--oh, I forgot to mention the hospitality suite where I enjoyed complementary beverages and snacks while waiting for my flight the next day, as well as doing online check in--wonderful dining, the best view of the sunset, and the always fine entertainment in House Without a Key (and these last three you don't have to stay at the hotel to enjoy).  
Yes, there were many Asians, but I didn't notice that the hotel reduced standard American food options to accommodate other guests.  No, there weren't bagels, but one could undoubtedly purchase one at any of the ubiquitous ABC stores nearby (and for a very cheap price).  
Yes, the beach is small, but there are plenty of wider beaches just to the side.  The pool is also smallish, but I admit I don't go to the hotel (or any hotel in Hawaii) for its pool (okay, unless it has a swim-up bar :-).  We far prefer to swim in the ocean.  It isn't a place where I think people would enjoy taking the kids because it does seem designed more for adults, and they do try to keep it very peaceful.

However....","We made the mistake of staying at Halekunali first before heading to Westin Maui.  That was a hugh stepdown.  Halekunali is first rated.  Yes, the location is not so nice.  The beach area is small.  But my friend, this is Waikiki.  If you want a quiet peaceful getaway in Oahu, this is it.  If you want a quiet peaceful gateaway, period, then go to Big Island or Maui or somewhere else.  This is afterall, a party town.

Halekunali is a very, very beautiful resort in a bad neighborhood.  Hopefully with the constructions, it'll improve.  The staff is extremely helpful, courteous.  We were upgraded to an ocean view room, with view of Diamond Head.  But we've to take 2 elevators to get there, which is kinda strange.  We were greeted with fruit plate and champagne (telling them we're on double anniversary).  Even the weekly Managers reception was great too.  Almost better food and drinks than most afternoon tea place.

Breakfast at the House without Keys is better than Orchid (IMHO).  I absolutely love the miso soup.  Seaweed is so fresh.  Yes, 80% of the clients are Japanese, but then so what.  Mai Tai is the best, shrimp grilled to perfection.  I love this hotel.

I have nothing bad to say about this resort.  You come here for the service, and the location.  You just don't come here for peace and quiet and big beach....etc.  Once you understand that, it's not that overpriced.","Date of stay: August 2005","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

A beautiful intimate hotel right in the middle of it all!!! Rate 10 for Oahu hotel. After driving around on the one way streets trying to get to the hotel which was at a dead end, we finally arrived at this elegant hotel. We had a beautiful ocean view and could look down on the House without Keys. We were greeted to our room with a wine/cheese/fruit plate and it hit the spot. It was 4 pm and we sat out on our nice size balcony and watched the people down on the beach and just chilled. Waikiki was very neat. It is a true swimming beach. People on floats everywhere and people out further on surfboards. It was much different than the beaches on the other islands but was beautiful in a different way. We enjoyed the view.

Later that evening we walked down the beach to Dukes and tried to get for dinner but there was an hour wait ? no thanks. So we headed for the street and made our way back to our little piece of paradise. Walking down the streets, I felt like I was in NYC. Traffic, crowds, high-end jewelry and fashion stores. The only thing that gave me a sensee that I was in Hawaii was the tourist shop squeezed somewhere in middle on each block. There are 1 Million people living on Oahu and 800,000 are in Honolulu ? add to that all the tourists and you?ve got a lot of people. 

We got a coupon upon check-in to take part in the High Tea at the Halekulani. It was very, very good. Nice yummy appetizers and desserts. 

We ate each morning at the House without Keys. They have a nice breakfast buffet.","Date of stay: September 2004","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

We first headed to Turtle Bay Resort on the North Shore of Oahu, Hawaii. That hotel was like heaven, peaceful, quiet, romantic.... then we arrived in Waikiki. Big Mistake!

We checked into the Halekulani, which is supposed to be the only 5 star hotel here in Oahu. Well, it was a pretty place...but in the middle of so much construction there were detours everywhere!! It was a pretty busy city with tall buildings covering each inch of land! They were famously known for their pool..it was alright..not large enough really, and they didn't serve any food poolside. 

I think everything about this place was overpriced, room was nice, but not for as much as we were paying..thats for sure! The food was overpriced...completely ridiculous! I had to pay $40pp for a buffet breakfast, when I only eat ate a measly 2 eggs and toast! ( no ala carte option)

Also, we felt like we were in  another country there...everyone staying at the hotel was from Japan, and the menus definetely favored to their likings!
(rice and miso soup for breakfast, but no bagels???)

There was a strip of good shops like Louis Vuitton, Gucci, YSL, Prada,etc..but the people working there seemed to be more attentive to the japanese. (I couldnt get a salesperson to help me in Louis...their loss!)

Oh and one more thing...there was practically no beach at all!!! No beach to walk on anywhere even..mostly what is there is manmade- sand trucked in. Terrible part of the island!

We would NOT recommend this place for anyone...overcrowed, obnoxious and overpriced...no beach, no beauty...nothing you would think Hawaii would be!","null","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

From the in-room check-in to the always prompt, friendly and exacting service, we did not have a single complaint.  As a frequent guest at various Four Seasons, Ritz-Carltons and Mandarin properties, the Halekulani has all of the little touches that make a visit special with the added bonus of being on the beach in Hawaii (for those who crave a more exclusive, private beach experience, however, Waikiki may not be for you).  Only suggestion is that they find a way to get a decent newspaper (NY Times/WSJ) to deliver in the morning, since the Honolulu papers are terrible.

I had a wonderful diner at La Mer at the Halekulani and understood it to be an exceptional hotel, of the level of the Mandarin.  Since I had business at Waikiki, I decided to give it a chance.  It is a great hotel with wonderful service but had so many problems that I wanted to warn potential guests.  When I arrived, the staff was wonderful.  They complete your check-in in your room however, had my rate wrong.  After a call everything was straightened out.  My friends arrived later that day with their two children.  They had requested two beds and when they arrived, there was two TWIN beds only.  A rollaway filled the whole room.  They were told there was nothing else available for two days.  After a lot of complaining, they were moved to a gorgeous one bedroom suite at no additional cost the next day.  The manager was very gracious. 
 
The pool is crowded, and there isn't much beach to speak of.  If you have never been to Waikiki beach, expect to be greatly disappointed.  Clientele at the hotel was largely Japanese.  

The rooms and bathrooms are really nice with all the amenities you expect.  However, if you stay at the end of the hotel near the street as opposed to the ocean (most rooms still have ocean views, even in the back) expect a lot of noise.  There is a big construction project right behind the hotel that starts early every morning.  Every night at appx. 3:00 am., there is a disco across the street that lets out a very rowdy crowd.  Every one of the nights I was there, at least 5 police cars were called in to disburse the crowd with sirens blaring (right below my window)  Not very restful.

The food in the restaurants is exceptional especially La Mer.  Great service too.

If I had the opporunity to go back there, I would only go if I could stay at the Mandarin Oriental.  We went there twice during this last stay and enjoyed their beach, restaurants and dolphin quest.  The Halekulani is a nice place but believe me, the Mandarin is a much better use of your money.  Makes you feel like you are in Hawaii instead of Miami.","null","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_20"

Upon arrival we were wisked to our room & registared there.  Included in the package were champagne & logo'd flutes, chocolate dipped strawberries, fresh fruit and their 'homemade' chocolates.  They were absolutely fabulous.  
We ate at Orchids the first night (it was in the package as well) and the food was fresh.  Every morning we had the breakfast buffet @ House w/o a Key and it was my favorite. The first day they had peanut butter pancakes that I wish they would have had again.  If you see those, GRAB PLENTY!  altho there are no coffee makers in the rooms, I enjoyed my daily walk to House w/o a Key for their complimentary coffee (starts at 6 a.m.)  
Our room was beautiful and had many nice touches. Fresh flowers, wonderful asst of bathroom amenities and the service IS perfect.
I highly recommend visiting this hotel for a romantic vacation w/o children.  The reason for the lack of an 'excellent' review is due to the cost of the room.

I decided to see for myself and over the course of eleven days, stayed at both.  I will write a separate review for each. 
I think the Halekulani is a beautiful hotel and the service was some of the best I've experienced.  I wanted to watch a Yankee game at a sports bar and three, count 'em three, concierges were on the phones, on the computers writing maps in seconds.  At breakfast, which was always great, you couldn't take two sips of your coffee or water without it being refilled.  Everyone knew your name after a couple of days and that was always nice.  That being said, the room...for the money I paid (over $500 a night) was nice.  I just think for that money, the room should be amazing.  It was nice... great view of diamond head, good view of the ocean, but I was overlooking the roof to the restaurant which was a little distracting.  The balcony was good too.  The pool area was good, someone always offering you water or cold towels.  I was bummed there were no hammocks (that should be a law, really), so I brought my own.  They told me they kind of ""frowned upon"" that, but referred me to a park next door, where they were certain it would be no problem.  If you're looking for a beach here, forget about it.  Non-existant, although you can walk a little and find one no problem. 

I went to Hawaii to de-stress and I really didn't relax at the Halekulani.  You can't hear the construction, at least not from the pool or my room, but it's there.  And there is a walkway around the hotel so there's always people milling about. The reason I went to Oahu is because I'm a single guy and wanted to experience Hawaii (and getting away from it all), and still enjoy some great nightlife, but the Halekulani, which is closer to the nightlife, is a little too close to everything. Truly the Halekulani looked like the best hotel in Wakiki, but not on the island.","Date of stay: May 2005","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Its quite a racket because you can't sleep more than 2 in a room--they only provide 1 King bed or 2 twins.  They say one child under 17 stays free in parents' room, but you actually have to pay $50.00 for a roll-away to accomodate that child.  Nevertheless, the hotel was absolutely gorgeous.  We had wonderful ocean views from the balconies.  Took advantage of the spa and was generally pleased with the service.  The pool attendants took care of drinks and cool towels, but forgot about my elderly mother lounging under a plumeria tree off the beaten path.  They failed to attend to her needs even after I requested they remember her.

The construction across the strees is horrendous.  Our hired car could not get close to the hotel because the street was closed.  My mother (who has trouble walking) had to schlep a long block in the heat to get to the hotel.  I understand the hotel has no control over this, and I certainly don't hold it against them, but if you are traveling there in the next 6-8 months with a similarly infirmed individual, you may want to reconsider.

I have never been to this island so I didn't know which hotel to stay at.  I simply looked for 5 star hotels and I found that Halekulani and Mandarin Oriental were the only two.  Some people were saying that the Mandarin was so old (and I hate old hotels) so I decided to book 2 nights at Halekulani.  The physical appearance of the hotel was fine.  The rooms were pretty nice and clean.  The front desk staff was friendly.  However when I got to the pool area, they were having contruction and there was no way to get on the beach or to get on their walkway.  they blocked about 3/4 perimeter of the pool so the only way to use to the pool is from the 1/4 side of the pool (which was from the deep end).  I had a 2 year old baby so I could not just jump in the pool with her.  When I asked how to get to the beach, they told me to walk out of the hotel, use the alley on either side of the hotel.  It was just so inconvinient!  I came back to the hotel and complained to the manager and his repsonse was simply ""i'm sorry"" and that was it.  He was saying that because I used Expedia to book my hotel, it was their responsibility to tell me that there were construction going on and that's why everyone got some discount.  Although I did book my room through Expedia, there was a technical difficulties because it wouldn't let me book 2 adults and 1 child.  So I just booked 2 adults and it worked.  So I called the hotel to let them know that I was bringing a child.  Then they made me email that information AGAIN because I just made the reservation and they said they wouldn't get it until tomorrow.  All this time, they never let me know that they were having a contruction.  Why am I paying all this money when I can't access the beach or enjoy the pool?  
The hotel manager had the worst attitude!  The only thing that he said to me was ""i'm sorry"" and that was it.  I asked there is anything he can do, and he said ""NO"".  I was so upset and disgusted by his attitude that I check out the next day.  The front desk never thanked me for staying with them nor asked me why I was checking out early.  
The next day I checked in at Mandarin Oriental and it was 1000% better.   I will never stay at Halekulani ever again.","Date of stay: April 2005","Trip type: Traveled on business","ui_bubble_rating bubble_10"

There are hotels with nicer rooms, more resort activities and a better overall appearance, but Halekulani really is king when it comes to service.  That being said, the rooms and ambience are great as well!  Room amenities are comprehensive and include three telephones, bathrooms with separate shower/bath, excellent selection of toiletries, large lanais, wonderful large SONY television and bedside electronic control panel.  The welcome chocolates were some of the best I ever had.

The restaurants are some of the best in Waikiki including the only 5 diamond restaurant on the island.  Service at La Mer was superb and the food, wine and ambience excellent as well.  Lewer's Lounge offers one of the most relaxing and intimate spots to grab a cocktail in Honolulu.  

I highly recommend the ""Back of House"" tour which takes place on Fridays.  Over a 2 hour period you are taken through all the back hallways and shown the ins and outs of the hotel.  Samples are liberally handed out, the best of which were in the pastry kitchen!  This tour truly exemplifies the feeling that you are treated like a cherished member of the family when staying at the Halekulani.","Date of stay: April 2005","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

It was a very nice four day stay and definitely our hotel of choice if we ever return to Hawaii. There are two items especially worth mentioning. The a la cart breakfasts on the outdoor terrace of the Orchids restaurant were excellent and served in a very pleasant setting with a view of the ocean. We did not try the buffet breakfasts in the outdoor House Without a Key restaurant but the choices appeared to be equally enticing. What really impressed us the most was our dinner at La Mer on our last night. It has to rank as one of our most memorable dinners ever. The ambience, service and food were all outstanding. It didn't hurt either that we were seated next to an open window looking down on the grounds of the House Without A key restaurant where we could see and hear a band playing Hawaiian songs against a backdrop of Diamond Head and the ocean.

Even though this hotel is not cheap, the rooms are not large or particularly modern. They are well appointed with muted walls and furnishings, and they are quite comfortable. What you get at this hotel is service. The staff, every member of the staff I encountered, bent over backwards to acommodate me.

If you want an oasis in the madness that is Waikiki, then the Halekulani is it. If you want the madness, pick another hotel.

A big note, however -- the day I left, April 4, 2005 --  they were beginnning the demolition of a number of old hotels on Lewers St which is the street directly perpendicular to the Halekulani (Lewers was an early owner of Halakulani). It will certainly be a mess for a while, so you might want to inquire about it. Also, the day I left the Halekulani was begining the refinishing their pool deck, and they said the pool was going to be closed until early May...you may want to confirm that the pool will be open before you book!","Date of stay: April 2005","Trip type: Traveled on business","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

He became ill on the flight over, and his condition worsened by our second night at the hotel.  Late that Sunday night, I called the desk, asking for advice.  Despite the late hour, and the weekend night, the concierge at the Halekulani had arranged for a doctor's visit and had transportation waiting by the time we made our way down to the lobby (ten minutes, tops).  I cannot say enough about the fine staff of this exquisite hotel.  For the ten days we stayed, we knew we were in the hands of caring people - which is a great comfort when you are far away from home dealing with illness.  We stayed on the hotel's property a lot because of his condition, but we didn't feel confined.  It was the most wonderful hotel we have ever experienced.  From the tea service to the restaurants to room service, we found the food and beverages to be simply outstanding, and served with genuine hospitality.  Both Orchids and La Mer restaurants are truly memorable.  The hotel staff (including the high level managers) inquired about my husband's health when we encountered them throughout the visit.   Honolulu Symphony tickets were complimentary for guests - what a nice touch.  The spa was a haven for me.  I had two massages and hair/nail treatments.  All services were delivered by highly-trained and gracious professionals in a relaxing environment.  We are going back this year because we just really loved it enough to want to enjoy it while fully healthy. As for location and surrounding neighborhood, we have been multiple times to Kauai, Maui, and the Big Island, as well as once to Lanai...and we are choosing to stay in busy Waikiki because of the outstanding Halekulani.  Besides, Oahu (and Waikiki) have a lot to offer and are great fun, especially if you can come ""home"" to the Halekulani when you want a respite.  Stay here.  You won't be sorry.  You will remember it forever...and if you amortize the cost over a lifetime of fond memories, it's worth every dime, and then some.","Date of stay: December 2004","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The Halekulani is located at the end of a dead-end street stringing several hotels along Waikiki Beach.  The area is bustling and packed with tourists, which have been coming to the area in hoards for around 60 years.  When you arrive at the entrance to the hotel, however, they do everything possible to make it feel as if you have entered a different area altogether.  The grounds are exquisite, with open Japanese-style architecture and garden areas, a lovely tea room, and probably the friendliest staff anywhere on the beach.

When we checked in, we arrived early (before noon), and were escorted to a separate waiting room, given beverages, and offers to freshen up while we waited for our room to be ready.  We were given orchid leis as well, which we discovered the hotel staff placed in the mini-refrigerator in our room after we took them off, to keep them fresh.  It didn't take long before we were escorted to our room, a large ""oceanview"" with a view of Diamond Head.  There are several room sizes, and ours had a lovely jr. suite type layout.  The balcony was not extremely large, but it wasn't small, either.  It was plenty for enjoying the morning air and the amazing sunsets, as well as the hula show from the restaurant along the beach.  We had a romantic dinner set up on the balcony one night that was amazing and there was plenty of space to enjoy the meal.The Halekulani is a U-shaped hotel, with most of the rooms circling the pool area, the restaurant, and with a view of the ocean, most of which are partial views.  The spa is nice, and is separated from the gym, which is nice for someone who wants a facial in a peaceful place rather than in a gym.  The spa was renovated in 2003, a new area was constructed near the hotel's entrance and near the grounds leading to the pool area.    

On arrival, our room had a welcoming basket of fresh fruit, chocolates, and nuts.  

The turn-down service is better than most hotels.  The hotel staff leaves tokens on your pillow, sometimes chocolate, an orchid, a seashell, a refrigerator magnet, or some other unexpected gift trinket.  It was kind of fun to open the little box to find out what was inside.  I still have the magnet on my refrigerator at home.

When we were there, there were several celebrities staying at the hotel.  Most felt comfortable enough to walk around the property, and were not harassed by the guests.  The hotel very politely asks that you respect their privacy, which was a kind gesture.

My only complaint was that the beach was too small, but I didn't intend to swim at Waikiki.  I visited several other beaches on the island that were pristine, with not a hotel in sight.

If you have to go to Honolulu, then stay at the Halekulani.  Don't expect the capital city to be postcard perfect.  A million or so people live there, and it is a city.  But don't blame the Halekulani and think less of this amazing diamond in the rough.","Date of stay: January 2005","Trip type: Traveled on business","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

My family (my husband, myself and our fifteen month old son) stayed at the Halekulani for four nights when we stopped in Honolulu en route to living in New Zealand for a year.  I was eight months pregnant and not too comfortable.  I cannot even begin to describe how helpful the staff were.  We arrived with ten HUGE suitcases and a ridiculous amount of baby ""stuff.""  We had even had a stroller shipped to the Hlaekulani in advance.  The staff happily stored 6 of the suitcases and never complained when we realized that we needed something out of one of these bags (and this happened a LOT).  

We were always greeted by name and everyone always had a smile for us and especially our little boy.We decided to spend a few nights on the North Shore.  The concierge recommended a place to stay and even told us which rooms to request.  They even kept our bags there while we traveled.

When we returned, our car (which we had rented through the concierge) had a flat tire and it was taken care of immediately at no cost or inconvenience to us.  

The rooms we stayed in were very nice.  Not the hugest or newest I have stayed in but nice.  I was not overly impressed by the bathrooms but I wasn't upset or dissapointed either.  

The pool was fabulous and the service at the pool so-so.  This was the only place in the hotel that I wouldn't rate service a five out of five stars.  Unfortunately there is not really much beach in front of this hotel.  However we drove to a few of the East and Western beaches for the day which was quite fun (especially since the Halekulani gave us a big cooler on wheels filled with ice and water at no charge for our daytrips).

All in all I would highly recommend the hotel, but if you have littlies who are dying to play in the sand you might want to go elsewhere.","Date of stay: January 2005","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The rooms are beautiful, the service outstanding and the gardens & pool area calm and relaxing - something that is rare in busy Waikiki! I gave only 4 points, however, because I also stayed at their 'cheaper' sister hotel 'Waikiki Parc' and found the value-ratio comparatively better at the Waikiki Parc, meaning you pay a lot less for similar equipment & service (without the oceanfront/pool). Also, though we got upgraded to an oceanview-room from partial oceanview, we could only see the ocean by standing outside on the balcony (the windows were facing the other side of the hotel).

In your room are complamentary homemade chocolates, water, and fruits. You also recieve an amazing complimentary breakfast each day in an open air restaurant on the water. There are 3 restaurants on the premises and are all outstanding. I loved ""House Without a Key"" the best. Oahu was also my favorite island and is gorgous. The North Shore is a MUST. A restaurant called ""Hallieva Joes"" was also great. It is located on the North Shore. The pool and Beach is also awesome. Get great specialty non-alcholic or alcholic drinks from the pool boy served to you right in your ever-so-soft lounge chairs. There is a great snokeling spot just about 50 feet from the beach with a sea turtle and tropical fish. ALL the employees were exceptionally professional and helpful.

After 9 nights of remote tranquility, we were ready for the action and excitement of Waikiki Beach. Due to many one-way streets in Honolulu, we had a bit of difficulty locating the hotel, but we eventually found it. Upon check in, we were disappointed that the staff was unable to upgrade our room, but that quickly faded away when we saw our room. The room itself was immaculate and stylishly furnished, but not remarkable. However, the large lanai with views of both the ocean and city was certainly impressive. As soon as we were alone, we cracked the complementary bottle of champagne and enjoyed a toast on the balcony. We were also treated to a nice plate of fresh fruit and the notorious Halekulani homemade chocolates. We can promise that they live up to their reputation! 

We then headed for a quick walk on the beach before the hotel manager's weekly cocktail reception. We savored a buffet of Asian and American delicacies and free Mai Tais and Champagne -- the perfect way to tide us over until our 9:00pm reservation at La Mer. During the reception, we met Patty Unterman, food critic for the San Francisco Examiner. She was in town as a judge for the annual Sake tasting and had literally tried hundres of Sakes that day. 

After the reception, we shopped in several of Honolulu's luxury boutiques (everything from Addias to Prada - I was in heaven!). We then returned to the hotel for our dinner at La Mer. The food there was absolutely outstanding - ranking up there as one of the best meals of our honeymoon - and we met a fabulous and informative sommelier. After the first evening, we didn't spend a whole lot of time at the hotel. We were too busy exploring Hanauma Bay, Diamond Head, and all that Honolulu had to offer. We did, however, find time to enjoy a sunrise breakfast on our balcony and a dip in the pool. We also relished in the hotel's strong Japanese culture. Halekulani truly did feel like an oasis, yet it was only steps away from all the charisma and action of Waikiki.

My sister and her 2 children stayed at the Kahala Mandarin which was lovely too, but different from the Halekulani in that it was further out of Waikiki and had more families. I would recommend Halekulani if you wanted an oasis amidst the busy rush of Honolulu. We found many of the guests were Japanese and there were few children, so it was a calm, quiet place. At the Kahala Mandarin the pool was noisier, with more kids. 

The restaurants in the Halekulani are great - they were the best places we ate at in Hawaii and we also stayed in Maui for 4 nts. If you want to shop, the Halekulani is a calm and beautiful place to return to after all the noise and heat. 

However, we did awake one Fri night about 4 am to hear lots of noise on the street - we figured we must have been near a nightclub that had shut for the night and we could hear the intoxicated guests on their way home (they were very loud!). Its great having 'all the action' on your doorstep, but this is one drawback. The other nights there were no problems. 

Service was friendly and profesional. Security was tight with guys dressed up like secret service agents (maybe they were!) often seen walking the grounds. 

They even let us use a spare room until 10 p.m. for no charge while we waited for our flight home, although they could have charged us.","null","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Halekulani translates as ""House Befitting Heaven"" and the translation says it all.  It was selected the number-one hotel on the island in 2003 by every top travel magazine and publication you can think of: Condé Nast Traveler, Travel and Leisure, Zagat's Top US Hotels, Resorts and spas, and so on.   We were absolutely blown away by this place!  We have both stayed at some very nice hotels before this one, but I have to say Halekulani stands apart, far apart.  Everything about this resort says each guest is treated like a VIP big shot.  Starting with a very private check-in where you are greeted by a receptionist who escorts you to your room for a private registration.   Then ending with the stretch limo service to the airport, which is at the cost of a regular cab ride for their guests.   This resort treats you like a VIP.  Complimentary Champagne, fresh chocolate covered strawberries and assorted fruits were prearranged on our coffee table with a personalized card congratulating us on our honeymoon.  Our room was very large and lavish for a partial ocean view room.  We had an incredible view of the pool, diamond head, and Waikiki beach from our private lanais.   We had a better view than some of the ocean view rooms did!  The service was A+, right from arrival to departure everyone addressed us as Mr. and Mrs. Heary.  Even the staff you don’t expect, like housekeeping, bell staff, wait staff, and pool attendants addressed us like visiting VIPs.  The pool at Halekulani was very nice with oversize pool towels.  Our only complaint was that it closed at 6pm every night.  It would have made a perfect moonlit swimming spot.  The resort is of course right on a great stretch of Waikiki beach with a stunning view of diamond head in the distance.   The beach was impeccably maintained. The central location of Halekulani made shopping, eating, and site seeing a breeze.  As for the restaurants, see the restaurants section above.  Overall this is the best hotel we have ever stayed at and recommend it even given its hefty price (it IS worth it).  We will never forget our experience at the “house befitting heaven”.

I happened to like the location.  You were in your own tranquil oasis at the Halekulani, but step out the front door and you were in the middle of all of the action - shopping centers, restaurants, small non-chain stores, Starbucks, etc.  (I didn't see any homeless people).  After we left the Halekulani, we went to Maui to Hyatt Regency at Kaanapali Beach.  Although our hotel was beautiful and the grounds were wonderful with the pools and waterfalls and birds - I felt it was a little remote.  You only had the stores in the hotel (not many).  If you wanted to go somewhere else to shop, the nearest hotel (Marriott) along the beach walk is still the equivalent of about 10 city blocks.  You really need to get into your car to go anywhere or be prepared for a long hike.  

Our room at the Halekulani was lovely, with a beautiful view and no musty smell (smelled like fresh linens all the time).  I had the crab salad one day for lunch - it was delicious - real crab meat which you don't always get anymore.  Our Sunday brunch at Orchids was a spread that literally had any type of food you wanted - breakfast, lunch, Japanese, desserts galore.  And dinner at La Mer was exquisite - good food, good service, good presentation and the slack band playing beneath us.  We had no trouble getting chairs or service by the pool and we were there on a weekend.  

We did have to wait about an hour to get into our room, but we arrived from Singapore very early (about 10:00 a.m.).  

It was a very relaxing weekend at this hotel.  We went to Pearl Harbor and a few other places, but always were glad to get back ""home"".  The view, the breeze, the room, the food, the pool, the service - loved it all.  

The only thing I didn't like was the beach.  The sand on Waikiki is kind of brownish and the beach is terribly eroded.  I am very partial to the New Jersey beaches and feel they're among the nicest in the world.  We have nice whitish sand, wide beaches, seagulls, and the salty air.

But, I hope to return to Hawaii, and would probably stay at the Halekulani again (if the price doesn't go up too much).","null","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The hotel is beautiful and the service is amazing. The restaurants were  fabulous as was the room service. Room service breakfast even came with your own toaster! My one complaint was the lack of shade and sufficient umbrellas at the pool. In order to get a chair with an umbrella, we literally had to be down at the pool by 6 am. This is not something I would expect to do on vacation. Even when I told the manager that I had had skin cancer and could not sit in the sun without an umbrella, nothing was done to accomodate me. With all the focus these days on how bad suntanning is for one's  health, you would think a hotel of this caliber would have been more understanding.","Date of stay: August 2004","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

We had a couple of minor glitches, but we love this hotel for it's service and the glitches didn't bother us too much.  We arrived early and were told to check back at the front desk at noon and our room would most likely be ready.  We checked back at noon, at 1:00, at 2:00 and again at 3:00.  They kept telling us to check back every hour.  This was agravating.  We finally got our room and didn't like being in the tower facing the Diamond Head view rooms.  They very graciously moved us over to the pool side and the room and view were perfect. We were always referred to by name and they were always asking if there was anything else we needed.  The room was very clean and felt very homey to us.

We really dislike the location of this hotel.  It is in a very seedy area by all the budget hotels.  We felt so peaceful and calm when we were within the Halekulani, but step out the front door and it's disgusting.  There are very run down hotels and restaurants right outside the front door.  We went for walks each day and one day we saw two homeless people under one of the beach pagoda's fighting and screaming.  We thought the man was going to hit the woman.  You see tons of homeless people trash picking and taking used ciggarettes out of the ashtrays.  It's really quite sad.  They sleep under the tree's in the park and make forts out of whatever they can find.  We have been going to Waikiki for years, but this year we found it to be going downhill.  The police presence is nowhere to be found at a time when the drug problems are rampant over there.  They are having a huge problem with crystal meth and all that goes along with it.  Things aren't so bad towards the Hilton end.  

The Halekulani is a wonderful hotel that is in a bad area.  I read that next year they are raising their prices $95.00 per night.  Wow! I want a butler for those prices.  It's already expensive.  We loved Orchids and house without a key.  It was wonderful sitting on our lanai and listening to the slack key at night.  The pool area is nice and quiet and the attendants came around frequently.  We are debating with the hotel raising their prices so high and the area that it's in, as whether to go back or not.  It really was quite a nice stay though.","null","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

I doubt that it is even one of the top four hotels in Hawaii. 

My wife and I just returned from two weeks in Hawaii.  Since the best flight for our air miles flew into Honolulu, based on its reputation we decided to stay a couple of nights at the Halekulani before moving on for 11 nights at the Four Seasons on the Big Island where we'd stayed last year. 

Location:  Smack in the middle of Waikiki.  Close to good shopping, apartment buildings with their laundry hanging out to dry on their balconies, and Denny's.  If you are looking for a real island getaway, this is not your place.   It may be the best Waikiki offers, but that's not saying much.

The view on the other hand, is stunning. 

Lobby/On Premises Shops:  Simple, small, subtle and not much in the way of amenities.  Decent gift shop and nice jewelry stores.  Not bad, but not nearly on the level of your typical Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons.

Room:  We had the in-room check in.  It's a nice touch as far as it goes, but at the Four Seasons, Hualalai we didn't even have to check in- we were simply taken to our room, shown around, and given our keys.   

We booked a junior ocean view suite at the rate of $770.00 including free breakfast and one free lunch during our stay.  The hallway to the room could have been from just about any Sheraton, Hilton or Marriot--if they'd been built in the 80's.  Unfortunately the room wasn't much bettter.  Some places like to advertise that they are ""old Hawaii"".  Could it be that they are simply just old?  

The first thing we noticed about the room was a strange smell somewhere between musty and moldy.  The second thing was the drop dead views of the ocean and Diamond Head.  The hotel does have incredible vistas from the higher floors.

The furnishings were 1980's Hawaii.  Tasteful '80's Hawaii, but dated nonetheless.  The bathroom had a single sink (inexcusable to me at that price), smallish shower and a not so inviting separate tub.  The small walk-in closet featured a room safe. The suite was considerably smaller than our less expensive regular room at the Four Seasons.

Pool/Beach:  Ok, so you aren't in Hawaii to stay in the room.  The pool in the ads looks great right?  Well...I don't know where that picture was taken but it sure didn't look like the pool at our hotel.  The concrete deck surface was stained and the number of chairs was so limited that we ended up literally overlooking a concrete wall and the pool attendant's stand.  The pool itself was small, warm and well maintained. Since we were a few feet from the attendants we thought we'd at least have good service...not quite.  We were there for over two hours and not once did someone come by with drink menus, water, or even a hello.  

The beach was a tiny strip of sand with incredible views and no service.  The chairs were all occupied every time we walked by.

Food:  Breakfast Buffet:  Average.  Not worth what it would have cost and definitely not what you would expect at a place like this.  Lunch:  I'm probably biased since I got food poisoning from the crab salad I had but the food at Orchids and House Without a Door (I think that's what it was called) was just not very good.  The review that said they got expired cheese didn't surpise me.  Dinner: La Mer was very good.  We had a nice meal and gracious service. 

Service:  Other than La Mer and the Concierge, the service was mediocre at best and awful (see pool) at other times.  I think part of the problem is that the place is 95% occupied by Asian tourists.  Please don't take this the wrong way, but tipping is not part of their culture the way it is here.  When waitstaff, bellmen, etc. are stiffed on tips time and time again, they aren't going to be at the top of their game.  I'm convinced by things like the tip calculator cards and automatic gratuity for the spa that this is a problem for the hotel and it shows in the service.  The concierge was very helpful, well organized, and gracious.

Spa:  This was the one highlight of our stay.  If you have to stay at the Halekulani don't miss trying a massage experience- especially if you are going as a couple.  From start to finish this was the best spa experience my wife and I have ever experienced, and I am in the business myself.  The private couples treatment room with the soaking tub for after the massage was not to be missed.

Summary:  If I ever had to go back to Waikiki there is no way I'd ever stay at the Halekulani, especially given the astronomical prices.  If you have never been there and can avoid Waikiki and go to another island instead, do it.  The Four Seasons, Hualalai and the Princeville on Kauai are both beautiful properties that are far better experiences.  If you have to stay there I'd suggest saving your money and trying any of the ""four star"" type places.  I really can not imagine that someone thought this hotel was one of the top four in the world.  If you are at all picky- and why would you be reading this if you weren't- you are not going to be happy there.","null","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_30"

1) No honeymoon upgrade
2) Great service otherwise... they created an itinerary for us based on our requests, made all our reservations for us around town and even got us great seats!  ... wonderful concierge
3) Food... good!!! Total luxury, great ambiance, wonderful service, good selection...
BEWARE: My husband's cheese (it was pre-wrapped) at breakfast was old... its expiry was several months prior... when I told the food manager, they took away the cheeses, but DID NOT APOLOGIZE or compensate my husband for his bad stomach later.  Watch to make sure the food is not expired.
4) View... if you are on a higher floor, it's great
5) Weather... weather in Hawaii in the winter is pretty unpredictable... we had rain nearly every day
6) There is not much to do at the hotel
7) The beach is tiny--- BUT... this doesn't matter since the entire Waikiki beach area is terrible.  If you want a good beach (white sand, turquoise water) rent a car and drive to the SOUTH EAST coast of the Island.. (it's about an hour away)... these beaches are spectacular.
8) The hotel is CLEAN, the rooms are nice, the bathroom is great, the soaps and things they provide are great... it's definitely first rate.
9) Location... really central to everything... definitely recommended.

We haven't stayed in a few years and noticed some changes which were not for the better. We recall completing check-in formalities in-room previously, and this time all formalities were completed downstairs like a standard hotel. Nothing wrong with that, only it seems that other people were still being checked in in-room so it felt a little odd. The new SpaHalekulani is a lovely space and the girls on the desk were very nice, but the manicurist was the surliest and most uncommunicative I have ever met and seemed annoyed that she had to be at work. The restaurant waitstaff were their usual delightful and helpful selves, but several of the duty and restaurant managers seemed rather gruff and brusque, something we had never encountered here before.  Room service staff also seemed very keen on ensuring that we gave them additional tips on top of the built-in gratuity (not the service/delivery charge but the gratuity amount added to the room service bill)  on the bill--basically they wouldn't leave the room until they have been tipped again. This felt very uncomfortable, as we had also recently stayed the Regent Beverly Wilshire in LA where the staff never asked for more than the 15% added to the room service bills (the service there was faultless I might add). The tipping issue was also raised again when one evening at dinner in one of the restaurants when we were presented with our check accompanied by a handy Halekulani tip calculator!  In case you are wondering, we normally tip around 20% when we dine out, so it wasn't like they had reason to educate us on tipping etiquette, but quite frankly we found it offensive to receive a mini laminated chart on how to work out 15% and 20% on varying check amounts when we hadn't asked for one. The Halekulani is still a glorious place to stay and we will no doubt stay again, but we won't have the same expectations that we used to have, as clearly the hotel won't be able to meet them.","null","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

We checked in at 4 p.m. on 5/29 after a long flight and found check-in to be quick and professional and relaxing...it was nice to dispense of the formalities in the comfort of our guest room.  The room was beautiful (Diamond Head Ocean View) but I don't think I'd pay $540 for the rack rate...we got a discounted rate at their website.  It's nice here, but not that nice.  We've stayed down on Waikiki several times before and always marveled at how nice and serene the pool area looked at the Halekulani and it was indeed wonderful!  The pool attendants were attentive and quick to hand out towels and set up our chairs and make sure we had everything we needed.  We had drinks one evening at House Without a Key (I remember it being a little more elegant and the restaurant actually enforcing the evening dress code last time, not so this visit so it was a little less than expected) and dinner at Orchids last night.  Orchids was good but not outstanding...we had a better meal and better service on our last trip at Bali By The Sea at the Hilton Hawaiian Village.  

The only thing about the visit that truly bothered me was that we weren't able to take advantage of the ""For You, Everything"" program because we happened to be staying here on days when the museums weren't open.  Halekulani guests get complimentary tickets to several Honolulu museums and cultural exhibits.  We wanted to see Iolani Palace but it was closed during the two days we were here.  The concierge wouldn't make reservations for us for later in the week (we're staying up at the North Shore for the next five days) because we wouldn't be Halekulani guests at that time.  That was a little frustrating, since I had been looking forward to the museum tickets since I made the reservation.  In retrospect I suppose I should have checked but oh well!  We're undecided as to whether or not we'd stay here again...I don't think I could justify the expense for more than a couple of days but that's just my experience.  The hotel is beautiful, the grounds immaculate and the staff is friendly and attentive, although hit-or-miss.  When our light bulb burned out, someone was up in five minutes to replace it but last night when we called to request turndown service, it took them 25 minutes to come up.  At the 15-minute mark we called downstairs to say ""Nevermind"" because we were tired but were told that they were almost at our room...and it was another 10 minutes before they arrived and it was very rushed...not nearly as refined of a turndown service as on our first night.  I do agree with the others...the coconut cake is pretty darn good too!","null","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

I could hardly believe I was in the middle of Waikiki! Once in our room, there was no city noise at all, but just the sound of the ocean waves outside. We went through check-in in our room. (If you don't smoke, make sure to ask for a non-smoking floor.) We bought the sunrise package and breakfast was included each morning. Don't miss the breakfast buffet at House without a Key! Oceanside breakfast with a bountiful buffet is the best way to start the day! They host casual dining throughout the day as well, and in the evening there is live music with a hula dancer. Our room was spacious and clean with a large bath area and closet accessible from two sides. CD player in the room, flat screen TV, robes and slippers, and a little surprise with nightly turndown. The service could not have been more gracious, warm and helpful. Take the short drive to Diamond Head for a hike to the crest; go early! For dinner, we had a great meal in Honolulu at a place called Indigo for Eurasian gourmet (recommended by our local connection!) We've made the mistake of staying at cheaper places downtown. Never again! This is the way to go!","null","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

Perfect! a real Hawaiian Paradise","I have visited the islands 3 times. Each time staying at the Halekulani. Each time it just kept getting better. It was a magical experience. A perfect ocean view and a magnificent view of Diamond Head. The sunsets were picture perfect! I enjoyed watching the whales swim by. I especially enjoyed drinking tropical drinks under the palm trees at night while watching the hula dancers. Also, a small 30 min. 
drive to Hanauma Bay set you up for a day of amazing snorkeling. Also, I visited Pearl Harbor to make the Perfect. The Halekulani is a definate ***** hotel and if you get the chance, you should definitely go.","null","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

The staff was extremely attentive and customer service was well above average. Had no problems with kids - the ones that were there were well mannered (and quite frankly, what resort isn't going to have kids). We were upgraded upon our arrival to an Oceanview Room (from a partial), which was a very nice surprise. We had absolutely no problems with noise - I'm a very light sleeper and would have heard the slighest bit of noise! The beach is quite small and the sand is not great, but if you walk 2 minutes down the beach you will be at the heart of Waikiki beach. We didn't want to be in the middle of all the action - that's one of the things I liked most about the hotel - it was so close to the action yet the hotel itself was very quite and subdued. I would highly recommend this property to anyone travelling to Waikiki - you will not be disappointed. We would definetly stay here again!","null","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

This was our 6th trip to the islands in 14 years, but our first to Oahu. The city noise (sirens!) and Honolulu traffic nightmare will prevent us from returning to the Halekulani or Waikiki. There is no real beach to speak of at the hotel. The pool area was nice, but rather small for a hotel with 400+ rooms. Also, there were way too many noisy kids with floats for us. Plus, you can't see the ocean when seated at the pool, due to the hedges. The Halekulani offered excellent food (the crabcake egg benedict at Orchid's was to die for). The service was above average, but not quite what we have experienced at Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton properities.","null","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_40"

We were pampered beyond measure. The hotel took the liberty of upgrading us to a full oceanfront room on the 4th floor, with an outside lanai with 2 chairs and a table and chaise lounge overlooking the pool and the ocean beach. Inside the sliding glass doors were another set of sliding louvered panels for privacy. When we checked in, an employee escorted us to the room for a tour and we took care of the ""paperwork"" in the room.The room included a huge main area, sofa, chairs, desk, King bed and entertainment center with stereo, CD and Video/DVD player. The lights, music, TV, message center, and phone were all controlled from a command center on the nightstand. The closet shared a wall with the bathroom, with sliding doors on each side, so you could access the hanging clothes from either the bathroom or the sleeping area, and the closet contained the safe, thermostat, and occupancy sensors to turn closet lights on when the room was occupied. (I suspect these were also used to let the hotel staff and housekeeping know when the room was occupied, so they never knocked when we were in the room.) The bathroom was huge, with a large deep tub and a huge separate glass-walled shower with thermostatically controlled water settings, sink, a lady's vanity with stool, and a complete assortment of every amenity for bathing and personal care you might imagine. The room included a wet bar with refrigerator and complimentary bottled water and juice. The hotel staff refreshed the ice in the 2 ice buckets 2-3 times each day. The room even had a doorbell in the hall!When we returned to from dinner the first night, there was a bottle of champagne on ice with 2 glasses, accompanied by hand-written note from the hotel manager, with congratulations and thanks for celebrating our anniversary with them. The bed was turned down, the bed cover had been removed and folded and placed under the bench at the foot of the bed, and there was another note from the staff wishing us ""good dreams"" and a wrapped seashell in a box on the pillow.We both felt spoiled and welcomed at the same time! The concierge staff took care of our every wish, arranging transporation, tours, and anything we needed, including several calls to our tour group Vacations to get answers to questions for us. The next few days were more of the same! Incredible courtesy, and a staff that lived by the hotel's motto:""For you, Everything...""The concierge staff also saved us a lot of time and allowed us to see more, since the tour group people insisted we attend the morning breakfast meeting, but wanted us to walk about 6 blocks to the breakfast location to arrive by 7 am and stay with them for most of the day for their free tours and sights. Had we done that, we would have been unable to book several tours which were selling out quickly. Instead, the concierge arranged for us to visit the Pearl Harbor & Arizona Memorial on Sunday morning, coordinating that tour driver to take us directly to a boat and submarine dive off Waikiki Beach, to return us for some shopping and leisure later that evening, and the Polynesian Cultural Center all day Monday, with a few hours more leisure on Tuesday before our flight to Maui. We plan to return soon!","null","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Halekulani is an oasis of tranquility in the middle of the busy Waikiki area. As you arrive, registration is done in your room, thus no long lines to check in. The staff escorts you and shows you around the room.

The interior and square footage of the rooms are all the same whether you book a Garden view or a prime ocean. The rooms are nice, all with big balconies, with an adjacent closet between the bathroom and the bedroom...as a result, you could easily get dressed in the bathroom without disturbing your spouse. The interior is wonderfully coordinated in white tones and impeccably clean with twice daily maid service.

The hotel is situated on the Waikiki beach which is a few steps away from the famous Halekulani pool. The pool is magnificent equipped with tanning chairs awaiting you. Pool service is equally good, as you choose your favorite location, a fitted cotton chair cover is provided along with a towel. As you first see the pool, one fully understand why it is so renowned.

The quality of service truly meets one's expectation of five stars. I have tried many others in this category and this, I had not yet encountered with.

No noises can be heard from your neighboring rooms and in the evening you can enjoy beautiful Hawaiian light music heard from House Without a Key.

The hotel hosts three restaurants: House Without a Key, Orchids and La Mer. All are highly recommendable and each features different menus and prices.","null","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"
