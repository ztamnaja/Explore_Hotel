862620851,50,Amazing place to stay!,"Amazing place to stay!! The views were amazing. The food and drinks great! The staff was very nice and accommodating. I wish I could spend forever there lol.

862560381,50,Great family holiday at the Prince,"Our family of 6 had a great time at the Prince. Looked at a lot of Honolulu options and are really glad we chose the Prince. We upgraded to the Club Lounge rooms, mainly thinking we’d use the lounge for breakfast instead of dragging kids to cafes. Instead, we ate most of our dinners at the lounge as well, the food was excellent and plentiful - steak one night, roast pork and crackling the next, seafood linguine. The breakfasts had a Japanese style to them, which was also really great - filling yet quite healthy. It was much better than any of the restaurants we went to, where due to staff shortages the wait to order and the wait to get food was pretty bad and kind of stressful (and expensive for a pretty average experience) - so just popping down to the lounge and eating quality food basically whenever you wanted with no delays was such a great option. The location is outside the main Waikiki strip, but it is opposite the Ala Moana centre for shopping, and is right next to the Hilton lagoon - the beach there is much nicer than Waikiki proper which was crowded, not clean and seriously stunk of marijuana being smoked. Right next door is Ala Moana park, which if you are into ocean swimming, offers a marked 1km swim route in clear flat waters protected by a reef which was awesome. The staff at the hotel were all really friendly and helpful (unlike the service at many local restaurants which was uncharacteristically poor for the USA).",Sep 2022,September 2022,Traveled with family,,"Melbourne, Australia"
862491780,50,Luxury meets practical,I stayed at the Prince for 5 nites to celebrate my 50th birthday and it was an amazing stay! The hotel is away from the hustle and bustle from mainstream Waikiki but close to parks and beaches! The Prince has some delicious restaurants and a Honolulu coffee bar that's open at 6am which is very convenient. Their Infiniti Pool has an amazing view and their overall accommodations are excellent! Highly recommend getting their ocean view room! It has an excellent view of the ocean which makes for a splendid stay in Honolulu! Aloha!,Sep 2022,September 2022,,We stayed on the 26th floor in the corner away from the elevator,

862381937,50,Lovely stay at the Prince Waikiki,"Just concluded a wonderful six night stay at the Prince Waikiki. We received a complimentary upgrade to a high floor - we had a truly phenomenal view of the marina, Ala Moana Park, and the ocean, which made even just hanging out in our room a delight. The pools were excellent, there were awesome specialty cocktails at the bar, and the staff were all extremely friendly -- housekeeping especially was always checking in to make sure we had everything we needed. Having Ala Moana mall a quick 10 minute walk away made lunch and dinner decisions a lot simpler -- there are so many food options there and you can save a lot of money crossing the bridge into the city proper vs only eating on the Waikiki strip. We would not hesitate to return to this special hotel.",Sep 2022,September 2022,,,

862320893,50,Perfect Hawaii experience,"Absolutely wonderful time at the Prince Waikiki! The staff, the pool, the drinks, the coffee shop downstairs- just FABULOUS! I went for my honeymoon and this felt like just the perfect hotel for the occasion. The hotel’s location is definitely something to consider because it is on the edge of Waikiki, so it’ll be a short walk to restaurants and stores. Most of the other Waikiki hotels have shopping as soon as you walk out the door. I personally loved that I wasn’t in the loudest and busiest part of Waikiki though.    I scored lower on value because I purchased my stay through Costco Travel where I received a significant discount from what the hotel page was offering. I didn’t eat at the 100 Sails restaurant because it seemed a bit overpriced for a hotel breakfast.    Overall though, I cannot WAIT to go back!",Sep 2022,September 2022,Traveled as a couple,,"Honolulu, Hawaii"
862215629,50,Amazing experience!,"Great price for the size of the room ocean and Ala Moana Park views. We stayed in the Ocean Front 1 bedroom suite with Club access and that was awesome. Great snacks, lunch, dinner, drinks. This last time we stayed in the Ocean View 1 bedroom suite and room was amazing as well. Rooms large and nicely furnished. Food from room service was so high end and delish!

862169632,50,So glad we stayed here!,"Everything went so smoothly from check-in to check-out. The hotel was clean and all the staff we encountered were very friendly. We loved or room and the floor to ceiling windows. We had such a great view of the ocean.    We had only planned to stay seven nights. So, we checked out after that seventh night. We went to get lunch and then head to the airport, but during lunch our our flight was double cancelled and rebooked, and now we had to find a place to stay for two more nights. After our airline was no help in extending our rental or getting us a hotel, I looked on the Prince Waikiki website to see if we could get back in, but the website indicated there were no rooms left. In our desperation, we called them just to double check if they really didn't have any room for us, especially since we liked it there so much. The lady I spoke to was beyond nice. She told me they were just about at capacity, but she said she would see what she could do. Between her and the manager, they were able to get us back in for those two nights. She indicated that she couldn't guarantee which room type we got (king or double queen) though, but we didn't care. We were just so grateful for them helping us out in our time of need. When we got back to the Prince Waikiki, we were surprised and so happy that not only did they get us back in, but we also got to go back to the very same room we had been staying in before. That made us all the more happy.    When we go back to Hawaii, we will for sure be staying here. I will give them all the business I can! I will recommend them to everyone I know.",Sep 2022,September 2022,,,
862079491,50,Perfect stay for our Oahu trip,"We looked at a lot of hotels before making our reservation and we’re so glad that we picked the Prince Waikiki.    Such friendly staff throughout the hotel made the trip extra special for us and our Ocean Premier Room on the 23rd floor had a great view of the Harbour and Ala Moana beach, particularly at sunset.    The hotel is placed ideally so that you’re close enough to the hustle and bustle of the waikiki beach area but also far enough away to enjoy a relaxing, peaceful stay.    Our room was great with a really comfortable bed and all the facilities you’d expect. The cleaning staff did a great job making our room look like new on a daily basis.    The pool area has plenty of sun beds and the infinity pool is a great way of cooling off in the sun. The pool bar area had a great selection of cocktails, drinks and snacks and we had a great view from the infinity pool terraceof the Friday night Fireworks at the Hilton Hawaiian Village.    The Ala Moana shopping centre was a short walk away from the hotel and the hotel included a Premier Pass providing additional discounts as part of it’s resort fee.    Overall a perfect location for our 1st trip to Hawaii and somewhere we’d definitely come back to in the future!",Sep 2022,September 2022,Traveled as a couple,,"Wigan, United Kingdom"
862050261,50,Felt like home away from home,"Highly recommend Prince hotel because I felt like “royalty” at this hotel. The amount of detail and hospitality that was offered at this hotel was amazing. The hotel staff were very friendly to from the parking valet guy ( I wish I got his name) to house keeping (Joan from the 20th floor was so sweet). I truly felt like Prince was my home away from home in Hawaii.    Prince is at a great spot and is away from the “5th ave strip” highly populated tourist area. Great scenery I loved seeing the view of the ocean when I woke up each morning.    I will definitely be back. I mean we will definitely be back.

The staff at Prince Waikiki were, by far, their strongest asset. Very helpful, always had an Aloha for you and everyone went out of their way to make sure our experience was personal and very relaxing. The location was perfect, in that it was not right in the middle of the busy downtown traffic and homeless problem Honolulu has. The room view was spectacular and provided us with the most amazing sunsets every single night. Housekeeping was excellent and very accommodating. On-site restaurants had extremely good food although they were pretty overpriced for us to go to most nights.

861765962,20,Mixed feelings about Prince Waikiki,"Pro: Mostly good service, room is cleaned, nice view  Con: it’s not really beach front, the elevator is loud. I got a room right in front of the elevator and it’s so loud. I had one pretty rude incidents from front desk. I got a late checkout and my room key was deactivated before my check out time. As a result, I wasn’t able to get some ice for my cooler and the front desk wouldn’t help me with that as according to her, I’ve already checked out.

861734404,50,Such a lovely place to stay.,"We had such a good time at the Prince Waikiki. The hotel is welcoming, clean, has great musicians who sing by the pool each evening, and very friendly staff. We had a lovely room on the 14 th floor overlooking the harbour, and the views were amazing. There was no noise from other rooms, despite the hotel being very busy and this part of Honolulu is far quieter than around Waikiki beach. We had sushi from the lovely Japanese restaurant on our first night, but mainly ate out. Thumbs up to the Goofy Cafe for breakfast nearby….the wait to get in is worth it. The hotel is easy walking distance to the largest mall on the island and good eateries, as well as Waikiki beach. On leaving the hotel, we found that we had left behind a present for someone, and the hotel posted it the following day. We can thoroughly recommend this hotel.",Sep 2022,September 2022,Traveled as a couple,"Breakfast isn’t cheap, so we opted to eat elsewhere. Fortunately there are many good options nearby.",
861681097,50,Exceptional Service,"The Prince stands head and shoulders above any of the 30 hotels I have stayed in over the last 12 months. The distinction is the level of hospitality and service. To a person, every staff member I encountered was kind, warm and helpful. Noelani, the concierge, and the lobby host were especially helpful. The rooms are immaculate with spectacular views.

I already miss the Japanese toilet. The other hotel accommodations were terrific. The only small inconvenience was that it was difficult to speak with the concierge desk.

The cleanliness and elegance of the room was great. Our room was very quiet. Usually you can hear other guests in other rooms, but the room we got was nice and quiet. Can't say anything bad about this hotel except that parking is expensive but that's normal for Oahu.",Sep 2022,September 2022,,Corner rooms are nice and quiet,
861304931,40,ENJOYABLE STAY,"The best compliment you can give to a hotel is if you would book to stay there again. We would certainly re-book without hesitation. Having said that, there is always room for improvement. We have never stayed at a hotel of this quality where there were no vanity kits ie shower caps, cotton buds, sewing kit etc in the bathrooms. If you book a Club Room, which we did, don't expect the same level of inclusions of food and drink that you would get in other high end hotels. It is very basic but still worth it and the Club Level staff were very obliging and kind. The rooms were very clean and we really loved the location because it was very quiet and an easy walk to the Ala Moana Centre. Having looked at the other hotels nearer the beach and around us, the Prince Waikiki stands out as more modern and stylish. Glad we chose to stay at The Prince.",Sep 2022,September 2022,,,Double Bay

860950958,50,Brilliant Stay,"Stayed 7 nights, Sep 11-18, and had a wonderful (first) stay. Most definitely met our expectations. All the staff we encountered were very friendly and willing to help.  Booked an Oceanfront Premier room and stayed in room 2803 on the 28th floor of the Diamond Head Tower. What a spectacular view - the marina down below, the Hilton Lagoon to the left, and Magic Island Park and beach to the right. And the ocean as far as you could see! Amazing sunsets. Great to have two windows that slide open. We were able to clearly see the Hilton's Friday night fireworks at the Hilton Lagoon.  We were able to check in early and took the first room offered. The room was opposite the elevators but it was not noisy. At times, just a very faint “swooshing” as the elevators passed the floor. The room was nice with a bath and separate walk-in shower. Included were 2 robes, a hair dryer, iron, and ironing board. The kettle was nice for hot tea and there was a small coffee maker too. We used the safe, which was nice to have. If there is future remodeling then we would suggest more drawer space and higher safe controls - a pain to bend down near the floor to open and close the safe, especially when you are over 6 feet tall. An immediate suggestion would be to add/replace the door strips to stop the light from the hallway getting in and reduce any noise. The King bed and pillows were very comfortable, although the bed squeaked on one side when sitting down or moving around.  Both the main and infinity pools were well maintained and a pleasure to use. The poolside bar was great and there was additional seating. Old reviews mentioned the “tired” pool loungers. They have been replaced and are new and comfortable!  We would definitely return to the hotel.",Sep 2022,September 2022,,,"San Tan Valley, Arizona"

The water closet had openings at the bottom and top of the door which was fine because I was along but had I been sharing that’s a little awkward. Coffee cafe in the lobby was tasty. Banana bread on point. Line was long by 8:00, but went quick. Everyone friendly and helpful. I enjoyed being able to request housekeeping when I knew I’d be out for several hours. My salmon from room service was delish. Pizza at the pool was yummy, but a bit pricey. Pool was beautiful, quiet, not too crowded. My stay was mostly during the week.

Beautiful Kahanamoku Beach and Fort DeRussy Beach 5-10 minute walk. Also super close walk to yummy restaurants like Goofys, Aloha Kitchen, and Cream Pot (to name only a few)    Value: 5/5  A bit expensive, but considering what you get for that money, very worth it!    Service: 5/5  EVERYONE was SO NICE!! From the moment we arrived we were greeted with smiles! The hotel provided us with a complimentary Prosecco for our honeymoon and the valet greeted us and remembered us whenever we left the and arrived back at the hotel.

The room is beautiful with harbor & ocean view and the floor to ceiling windows. It is ecstatic to wake up every morning with the view of ocean and surfers out there. We love the infinity pool with a beautiful harbor view. They had live music at the bar by the pool many nights during our stay. We had buffet dinner at 100 sail, it was fine.    There are many restaurants within walking distance. Walking to the beach is only 5 minutes. The hotel is very close to Alamo Ana shopping mall thus you have plenty to do around the area. The bus is only 1 or 2 blocks away. We use uber to downtown Waikiki and it is not expensive. I feel like a vacation at the Prince hotel because it is not too bustling like downtown Waikiki.    We played golf at Prince golf courses. The hotel provided free shuttle bus in the morning to the golf course which is 45 minutes away. Guests at the hotel get 20% off the green fee.    Overall it was a perfect 5 nights Hawaiian Holiday in Waikiki before our trip to Maui.

859542744,50,Lovely hotel,"We recently stayed in a Club room for 5 nights.    What we liked:    - the room and bathroom was lovely.  - the service at the hotel and in the club room was exceptional.  - loved the view from the room over Ala Moana beach and loved being able to open the windows to get fresh air  - luxurious towels and a well appointed bathroom  - club lounge was a nice feature which we used most days  - the shop downstairs has well priced drinks and snacks to take to your room    For some feedback and things to be aware of :-    - the location is a bit far from downtown Waikiki. It’s walkable (25 minutes in the heat) or a $10 Uber ride - not a deal breaker just to be aware of  - housekeeping was annoyingly late every single day. At about the time you might want to return to your room for a nap at 3pm. You really would expect a Club room would be serviced earlier than this.  - we didn’t really like the beer and wine at the club lounge. More options would be better. I probably wouldn’t return and pay for club access for this reason.  - Pools were full of screeching children. I had hoped for a more adults/luxurious experience. In fact 2 nights at the club lounge we had to endure tantrums from a young child who probably should have been removed by the parents and taken to their room.    All things considered, we enjoyed our stay, and may consider staying again - but not a done deal and would probably check out some other options.",Sep 2022,August 2022,Traveled as a couple,,"Port Macquarie, Australia"

However, the hotel decided to do water line repairs the last night we were staying there, and we could not sleep because it literally sounded like someone was drilling right above our room for several hours in the middle of the night. The hotel did not notify us in advance of this planned disruption; they informed us via a letter in our room 12 hours before the construction began and stated only that water would be unavailable from 11pm - 4am. They did NOT mention the massive amount of drilling that would be occurring in the middle of the night. We had to get up early the following day to catch a flight and ended up not getting any sleep because the drilling was so loud, especially between 12am and 3am.

To be clear, most of the staff that we interacted with continues to be friendly and helpful. It is unfortunate that Prince Waikiki does not appear to be training their staff to the standards of old. On a side note, their pools and amenities at the pools are in desperate need of a refresh.

857002485,50,Beautiful resort and great staff,"My husband and I stayed for a belated 10yr anniversary and we loved it. Everyone was so helpful, the facilities were immaculate, and our room was fabulous. I really loved the free water bottles every day. Such a small thing ended up being a huge help.    When we got there they had a bottle of Prosecco waiting for us. Our first night we had a Club Floor room and it was beautiful. The Club Lounge was great, but I didn't think it was worth the extra cost if you wanted it added onto a room other than the Club Floor rooms. The room was on the 31st floor and the views were spectacular. The room itself was pretty standard. Not overly huge, but didn't feel cramped at all.    We were originally supposed to be in that room the whole time, but very last minute changed it to spend the majority of our stay in a suite. I cannot recommend the suites enough. We were on the 11th floor for that and it was soooooo spacious. The views were still beautiful and it was so nice having that little bit of extra space if one of us wanted to have a nap while the other could do other stuff. The couch in the parlor does pull out, but the mattress was very very firm so we didn't use it. That's pretty standard for pull out beds though.    Their pool was AMAZING. I loved watching the sun set from the infinity edge and the pool staff was very attentive. They had live music many of the nights and you're able to see fireworks from the pool deck Fridays at 8. Drinks weren't too overpriced. Everything there had a bit of an upcharge, which is to be expected, but nothing outrageous. We unfortunately never had a chance to try one of the restaurants on site, but were told by several people outside of the hotel how good they are.    The only slight bummer was it wasn't quite as centrally located to a bunch of shopping as some places, but honestly it was kind of nice because it was a little quieter. Ala Moana shopping center is only a 10min walk away so it's by no means far from things.    Overall it was absolutely perfect for an anniversary celebration and I cannot recommend it enough.

854910145,40,Great service with a good view,"The good:  - The room was clean.  - The staff was extra friendly and helpful.  - The view was amazing - we got to wake up to the view of a beautiful shoreline every morning.  - The hotel is not too far from the bus station, and some chain/fast-food restaurants are nearby. It is very close to the beach, and we got to walk to see the Hilton fireworks on Friday evenings.  - The water pressure was great, and the bathroom was decently sized with a separate door for the toilet.    The mediocre:  - Wrote instructions and called ahead twice to ensure the toddler rails were set up before our late arrival, which was not done. We had to wait for someone to come to the room after checking in around 10 pm to set up the toddler rails. However, the hotel corrected this immediately and made sure to accommodate us for our troubles.  - The housekeeping service is at random times every day. Some days we would not have housekeeping come until 2 pm, and other days, they would leave a slip around 9 am saying that they can't service the room because we had DND on the door.  - The wifi can be unstable sometimes during peak hours, but I think that is common for all hotels.

We were planning on staying a sixth night and needed somewhere to stay. We had the privilege of stumbling upon this property on the first day of our vacation in Waikiki and enjoyed the most amazing Sunday brunch at their restaurant 100 Sails.... Immediately, we regretted staying where our marketing package had taken us. Nonetheless, we spent our last, final and most amazing day at the Prince property. These people are wonderful, property is beautiful beyond belief. Guest services is 2000%. We told him it was her daughter's birthday and we found a beautiful bottle of Prosecco in our room when we arrived. We were treated like royalty and we are not alone they treat everyone this way. If you have an opportunity, do not let this property slip buy... they may be a bit pricey but worth every single penny. Restaurants are amazing, rooms are immaculate, pool is gorgeous, poolside bar service and food service is amazing.

854473476,50,What a Wonderful Hotel!,"This was our second trip to Hawaii and first to Oahu and we were very glad we did all of our research and chose the Prince Waikiki. For starters they offer a complimentary fruit cut up service at their restaurant 100 Sales, and Margarethe at the restaurant was very welcoming with our daily fruit (Hawaiian pineapple is amazing). Additionally in the lobby of the hotel is a location of Honolulu Coffee and they are open 6:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. each day offering coffee and other drinks (side note, definitely worth checking out Honolulu Coffee’s Experience Center a short drive from the hotel). The hotel offers one room water per person every day but you can fill water bottles 24/7 at the fifth floor gym. There are a great set of pools on fifth floor too, please note it can get windy up there! The staff was excellent from front desk to housekeeping and everyone in between. It is so nice the hotel is situated away from the busyness of Waikiki Beach and Kalakaua Avenue, but you can walk there as needed as all the hot spots are within a 1.5 mile radius. Based on the location off the strip the hotel is closer to Ala Moana Center and a very nice Whole Foods too. Parking is easy as well as the lot is next door and self park is $30 per day versus valet which is $38 per day. We have another family member who stayed with the Prince family of hotels on the Big Island of Hawaii and they loved it too so looks like Prince Hotels works quite well in Hawaii!",Aug 2022,July 2022,,Choose an upper level floor looking out over the marina,"Victor, New York"

They offer a promo rate but use bait and switch and fuzzy math so the actual rate you pay is hundreds of dollars more.    My husband helped our family talk to staff who seemed clueless and just talked in circles. The manager ultimately gave them a $150 credit but our family still paid about $500 more than planned.

The lobby area, lounge, and recreational areas were very modern and spacious. The kids could swim in the big pool for hours, while we laid back on the lounge chairs. They also had foosball and ping pong tables. It would have been better if there were also, a couple of pool tables to play pool. The bar served the customers near the pool and had an outdoor seating area to order food and snacks. This hotel was by far the best in Waikiki, which was also a few minutes walk to the beach. We are definitely looking forward to going back next year to the Sheraton Princess Waikiki.

If you’re looking for a quick walk to the beach, this isn’t the hotel for you either. It’s about 10-15 mins walk to the nearest beach.    I wish the hotel would at least provide hourly shuttles to pick up/drop off guests at a couple of strategic locations in the city. They don’t even provide free bike rental.

I have 4 bites on my left leg and 1 bite on my right.    2. You pay 30 buck a day for parking but if you were to come back after 8, good luck with finding a spot. You end up doing valet parking and when you get your car, you have to tip the person. So you end up paying 5 bucks more per night. Happened to me twice when I stayed there.    3.

852487294,50,Excellent in everything that counts,"Fantastic property conveniently located. Here are some extremely minor points where they could improve. These are not deal breakers, but rectifying them would have made the Prince perfect.  1- in room free coffee was awful  2- the shower hose was stiff cheap rubber instead of more premium feeling steel hose  3- The 100 Sails restaurant food tasted great but the dinner buffet price was way overpriced at $85/person. A lower price would have had us eating there more than just to try it once.  4- I hate the lack of privacy with the sliding bathroom door, where every noise can be overheard.  5. And this is a little out of their control since I am told the sushi restaurant inside the hotel is not theirs; but that restaurant was small, had limited hours; and just seemed more trouble than it was worth to try to eat there.

852224698,40,Nice hotel at good location,"Prince Waikiki is located at a very convenient location and one can walk easily to nearby beaches, park, shopping center and restaurants. Ample public parking right across from the hotel if one doesn't want to pay for hotel parking. Room service was quick when I requested firmer pillows and they were delivered promptly.    The pool was very busy and we didn't get a chance to use it at all over 6 nights of stay. The gym was also very small and cramped. If these 2 amenities could be improved that would've made the stay very enjoyable.    I did have a bad experience with a concierge who tried to convince me to rent a car from a used car dealership (he gave me the card for the dealer) at a higher daily rate than what I can get from Expedia. The concierge was telling me how expensive Uber/Lyft would be compare to the daily rental rate which was not true. I don't know if the car dealership was associated with the hotel or just with the concierge. For those who don't need a car everyday or travel to far away places (I only need the car for one day to go to North Shore), I would suggest to use Uber/Lyft or rent a car for a day or two and park it across the street ($1/hour).",Aug 2022,August 2022,,,

852025128,50,Flawless Stay at the Prince,"Huge Tripadvisor junkie here. Whenever I travel, I always hit Tripadvisor to research where to stay, go, eat. It's an amazing resource and I've found some amazing places as a result.    The Prince Waikiki is the latest find. Rated as 3 or 4 on the whole island. This hit all the boxes. We stayed for a week. I struggled with booking something that was in the middle of the madness or on the fringe. So happy we chose being on the fringe. Besides trips to the north shore, hit the beach on the other side of HHV lagoon a couple times. Easy walk. Ala Moana mall was also an easy walk with all kinds of interesting dining options. We probably ventured into the middle of Waikiki twice and that was plenty.    Booked a club level room. I struggled on this for the longest time. We really aren't ""club lounge"" people. So glad we did. Puts you on the very top floors of the hotel with the best views. Check in was a great experience. Mark gave us a tour of the lobby and then walked us up to the club lounge to finish the check in. I enjoyed a local pineapple IPA while they checked us in. Elevators with the city/mtn views were awesome. And then walking into the room and taking it all in with the floor to ceiling windows. Room was super quiet and comfortable. Kids got a kick out of the heated toilet seat. Room was attended to everyday. The housekeeper did an amazing job.    I received a text message on the second day asking how our first night was. Pretty cool. They clearly care.    Read all the reviews on the club lounge and really didn't know what to expect as far as meals. Prince is an Japanese brand so it had big influence in the selections. Scrambled eggs, fried rice, miso soup, Portuguese sausage, cold salad bar, juices, etc. for breakfast. Lunch really was just a light snack. I seemed to recall a tofu snack that was offered twice a long with salad, chips, etc. Dinner typically has one protein (seafood, prime rib, etc) along with veggies, rice, potatoes, desert, salad. We had many meals here. Soda, beer, wine, coffee, teas, flavored waters were available all day. My kids tried new things and came away liking it. The soda stream machine was something else. I would bring my water container down and fill it with water. The machine has options like still/carbonated, many different fruit flavors, you could select strong flavor or light, cold water or tepid. It was pretty cool. The club lounge was right off the pool deck with views of the pool and harbor. We were able to keep an eye on the kids swimming while enjoying a beer, or two. The staff in the lounge were amazing. It was busy but they kept up with refreshing the food, clearing tables, etc. No need to wait in the long coffee line in the lobby. Strongly recommend the club lounge.    Pool deck was swesome. Pool was large. Infinity pool was amazing to just hang over the edge and watch the sunset. Hot tub was small for a hotel this size. They had a dj or live music several nights.

The bathroom has a separate toilet room which is great but that door has a super big gap! So there is no privacy  3.

849159493,50,Perfection at Prince,"I absolutely loved it here. It was perfect from the moment I checked in (they were able to get me an early check in, my room was ready when i arrived at 1pm) I had a room on the 30th floor in the corner right next to the elevator, tucked away from the other rooms, the views were unreal!! (Room 3001) The room is modern and gorgeous, updated media on the TV, they even had a little charger with all types of plugs attached to the phone which saved me from having to buy a micro usb cord when i misplaced mine. The bath products are a brand I've loved and used for a long time (Maile). Parking garage is easy and very close to the hotel, and they only charge $15 for kamaaina. I don't like those mega resorts and Prince is the perfect size. The pool is also perfect size, plenty of lounge chairs, beautiful views, and attentive wait staff. All the staff I encountered were so friendly and engaging, the location is super ideal for Ala Moana shopping and the boardwalk stroll to get to the main drag in Waikiki was easy and scenic. They even have my favorite coffee in the lobby at Honolulu Coffee co. (Lavender Cold Brew) I could go on and on about this place. I come over to Oahu a few times a year from the Big Island and I will never stay anywhere else when visiting Waikiki.",Jul 2022,July 2022,Traveled solo,,

The rooms are wonderful, the bathrooms, beautiful, comfy beds, great amenities, coffee, tea, shampoo, conditioner, body lotions and soap. Yes, the chairs at pool are a bit uncomfortable but I think I know why they have them. The winds can be fierce out there.    If you ever see a negative review for Prince, ignore it. Stay here, be treated like royality. Emma and Mark (?) greeter older Hawaiian/ Asian gentleman, you were the best. Wish I could have taken you two back to the mainland with me.

We were surprised by a knock on the door our first evening, and were greeted by a bottle of champagne, two glasses and a lovely anniversary card. NOT EXPECTED!!

We really enjoyed the spacious bedroom with the nice decor. Also all of the staff members were very friendly and kind.    Club lounge serves three hot dishes and cold salad bar for the breakfast and the dinner. Also their mini bar has a good selection of beer, wine and soft drinks.  We saved spending money on buying water bottles as we refilled the bottles with variety of water choices!  If you're using the club lounge, I wouldn't recommend the buffet dinner at 100 Sails as they have similar menu.    Teppe at the Activity Desk was very helpful planning our day trips to the north and west shore. Thank you!    I enjoyed chilling at the pool area in the morning and in the evening. You can watch the Hilton Hawaiian's fireworks here on fridays at 8pm!    Only disadvantage was that there is no direct access to the beach.    Other than that, we had a wonderful stay at the Prince Waikiki and would love to come back for the next trip!

848389431,50,Gorgeous hotel - about as close to perfect as you can get,"We stayed at the Prince as a family of four - parents and our late-teens sons, with two queen+queen rooms between us. The hotel was perfect for our needs: comfortable beds, a wonderful view from our rooms, a luxurious bathroom (bath and separate shower!), a lovely swimming pool with infinity pool and shaded poolside bar, a coffee shop on site with a good selection of food, on-site shops with a wide range of well-priced goods and a gym. We didn't use the spa or restaurant but would have done with a longer stay. The location is really good - right by the marina, a few minutes' walk from Waikiki beach. We arrived in the early hours of the morning and were very impressed by the friendliness of our welcome - just what was needed after a 5-hour flight delay. We checked out early in the morning for our flight home and received friendly and quick service yet again. This hotel had no hidden extras to pay on departure, which had been the case with other hotels we stayed at. Our stay was part of a 2-week California / Hawaii road & fly trip and this was the best of the hotels we stayed in. Very highly recommended.",Jul 2022,July 2022,,,"Leics, UK"

Being a Prince Preferred Club Member gets waived resort fees and a small credit for food / beverages.    We only tried the breakfast buffet on our last day before check-out, and the food choices were very good...especially for my wife who was born in Japan and my kids who enjoy both western and Japanese food. But, it's not cheap!    The room and view were beautiful. We enjoyed the pools and patio area almost every day of our stay. We had a rental car, and they charged us a daily parking fee, ut the garage was convenient.

Service is amazing and everyone so chill and happy here - the room was great and all the staff - I did not have a bad experience in this place. Everyone makes you feel so comfortable and relaxed. I wish the menu was bigger at the pool bar and for the room service (which was the same menu) but maybe it’s due to Covid !? Or staff shortage- even though I never ever felt that being there! Great musicians on Thursday Friday, Saturday and Sunday - if you can rent a cabana it’s worth it ! We did it on a Sunday with another couple and it was great, we had our own waiter and she was on it! Great DJ and amazing sunset views! We had a great experience, and would for sure go again, also if you don’t want to be in the noisy Waikiki downtown , this is perfect, the hotel is located close enough to walk (about 15 min walk) and quiet - but also a 2 min walk to the mall which has a lot of different restaurants as well! Downtown Waikiki is always loud and busy so it was nice to be in a quieter area especially when you take a dip in the infinity pool - another tip , if you go to the hotels website and become a member (which is free) they will wave some of your hotel fees. They also have specials at times and parking was free and included with your room! Mahalo Prince Waikiki!!",Jul 2022,July 2022,Traveled as a couple,,

The room was amazing, a panoramic view of the marina where we can see the infinity pool. Anytime you needed thing, they easily delivered to your room.    What impressed me most, was how accessible they were to those who had mobility issues. They even had a lift to bring someone into the pool and we saw them in action using the mobile lift transporting someone from the pool. These employees were trained and courteous to the disabled guest.    Our flight was delayed to midnight, and they held our bags, allowed us to hang out at the pool and allowed us to use the shower at the pool. They even had a singer at the pool bar.

847409568,50,Wonderful location for adults with no kids!,"It was our first time staying at the Waikiki Prince hotel and we were pleasantly surprised. I’ve stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village a few doors down and never cared for how long it takes to leave the hotel (walking, elevator, valet and navigating the crowds). I’ve also stayed a smaller boutique type hotels further down the Waikiki Beach, but the rooms do not compare with how beautiful the rooms are at the Prince. We spent a little more money, but it was totally worth it. It was just right for my husband and I. Now, if we were traveling with my daughters and their family’s (grandkids), I probably would opt for renting a house/condo. I really liked how easy it was to park and get our car each day and how nice and responsive the hotel staff were. The pool is nice for adults, but not super fun for kids. It got very windy at night up there, but the weather was a little “stormier” than what I’m used to.

846738723,50,Will never stay anywhere else on Waikiki - stay at the Prince!,"I grew up in Oahu but moved to the Mainland 25+ years ago. We love to travel and experience all the islands and this time wanted to show my teens The City. The Prince Waikiki was truly one of the best places we have stayed. We were super fortunate to have a one bedroom suite and then received an AMAZING upgrade. We also had another room for our teen and her friend. The views are spectacular!!!! Yes you are a walk away from main Waikiki beach but we loved getting our steps in every day and its totally do-able ie 15-20 minute walk. Besides - you can walk along the amazing beaches the whole time and see all the other hotels and busy beaches and scenes and be thankful you are a bit removed. It was beautiful seeing the boats leave the harbor and the surfers. Everyone who worked there from the front desk to the valet to the housekeeping were truly wonderful. The beds are super comfortable and the black out blinds DIVINE.    As I mentioned it is a walk to the Waikiki beach but you are still minutes from beaches to swim in. Also, being near the end of the strip another fantastic bonus -Ala Moana mall. It is so big, awesome, and tons of cheap eats for kids which is always a plus when we travel.    Do yourself a favor and trust the reviews - it is a great hotel for the Waikiki area. They also have a great pool which you can sit in the Infinity and watch the sunset. They also play a movie for kids on Tuesdays(?) in the pool which is great if you have littles.    I really want to thank them as we have been Prince members for over 20+ years in some shape or fashion and it was the first time we ever received an upgrade and whether or not it was because of that - it made our trip just purely wonderful. We love going to the Big Island for its quiet serenity but the whole family agreed the hotel and location and the rooms made this a fantastic stay and great way to experience the city!    I know people don't always trust reviews but trying to be transparent - it is the city so just know that. You are not at a removed tropical resort - but we loved this time to have access to cheap eats, drive to the North Shore or Lanikai, etc. The only other nitpicky things I can say is that they have a really nice restaurant there and we ordered chicken and ketchup (?). Just don't do it LOL. It was an odd item but I didn't want fish and it was kind of a waste of $40 - it was just odd and unedible to everyone in my family lol otherwise great stay!",Jul 2022,June 2022,,,"Seattle, Washington"

846235723,50,Prince Properties remain consistent and strong!!!,"It was an easy decision to choose the Prince Hotel. I’ve stayed at several of their properties throughout Japan and this one on more than one occasion. Eli consider myself brand loyal to Marriott and Hilton, however, I find myself going out of my way to stay at Prince properties whenever I am on Oahu or when abroad; it’s just a different experience.  The service is consistent and what you receive is a great value for the amount paid. The room was tastefully done, natural tones with electric curtains and blackout curtains and the view over the harbor and adjacent beach stunning.  This trip I stayed in a club level room. The lounge was small, but always able to maintain the flow of fresh food with demand. We were always met with a warm welcome and it truly added to the ambience.  The pool deck was a little chaotic. It could have been partially due in part to the warm weather but space was limited. They did have Bali beds available, the pricing wasn’t outrageous… so you have options if you want a reserved place that comes with a nice charcuterie board adjacent to a bar and very attentive staff.  The only slight drawback to the stay was the rate at which rooms were cleaned on a daily basis. We had early morning tours both days and were out of the room at 7am and back around 4pm only to find that the rooms had still not been cleaned. I understand that they are running at capacity but not having fresh towels after a day of exploring and sweating was a little frustrating. Always quick to respond to our requests, I found that if this was the only problem encountered then it really wasn’t an issue.  I’d highly recommend this property; it’s location adjacent to Waikiki beach but not in the center of everything made it both accessible but also a nice retreat to get away from the crowds.",Jul 2022,July 2022,Traveled as a couple,,"Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina"

844944058,30,Nicely appointed hotel - but nothing special,"The rooms are nice - comfortable beds, nice size room, bathrooms are very nice (even have a heated bidet seat), windows open wide, and very nice sun and blackout shades that cover the entire window.    The rest of the hotel was rather average. We tried the buffet at 100 sails and it was marginal at best and certainly NOT worth the $75/plate charged. We got better poke from Costco. Coffee bar downstairs was ok - but slow and often too long a line to bother with. Other guests said the sushi restaurant was very good - but we didn't try it.    Pool is nice but rather small. The lounge chairs are that stretched mesh over a metal frame, most are torn - and not very comfortable. The cabana's seemed nice - but are $200/day or more - just not worth it. Infinity edge pool is a cool attraction. Hot tub is super small and usually too crowded to get into.    We stayed in the Diamond Head tower - and elevator service was slow - sometimes as much as 5 mins to get a car that arrived and had enough room for 3 more people.    We paid for self park - but often the garage was full. The sign out front says to just take your car to valet - but the valet attendants just tell you to drive around the lot full sign and park in the reserved spots. Doing so gets you a nasty note on your windshield saying these spots are reserved and to use valet.    Lastly - this hotel is not on the water - you can see the ocean, but the hotel actually borders the marina which is pretty skanky water. If you want to get to the ocean it is about a 10-15 min walk - either direction - to get to beaches and swimming.    The Ala Moana park - to the left as you leave the hotel - is very nice and a ton of places to sit out. There is also a huge open air shopping mall across from the park.",Jun 2022,June 2022,,,

The moment you step into the lobby you immediately soak into that vacation mode of excitement!  We stayed in the ocean front suites on the Ala Moana tower side. It was breathtaking! We walked into our suite and we were blown away with how pristine our new-found home was and not to mention the impeccable view of the sunset and harbor. It automatically gives you that calm, serene and tranquil vibe. From the rich scent of my favorite organic Maile skin and body products to the radiant sunset views while sipping my Prosecco at the cabana.  Oh! That reminds me…our server Terry! She was excellent! All of the staff at Prince Waikiki made our experience so wonderful! The food and cocktail menu at the Hinana bar was perfect poolside! Get the Poke with the nori chips with their Instant Gratification signature cocktail! So good! My 6 yr old son loved the Margherita flatbread! The whole menu is great! The pool was perfect and the ambiance was amazing! We also had dinner at 100 sails, now that menu was DELICIOUS!! You have to get the SURF n TURF, Kauai shrimp scampi, short rib and grilled ahi during your stay.

843951468,50,First time going to the island of Oahu in Honolulu Hawaii,I chose to go with Prince Waikiki Hotel also because it was they had a good deal I purchased my bundle through Costco travel I got my three round trip flights the hotel and my car. From the pictures it looked beautiful and had great reviews I was obsessed with the ocean front view it was absolutely gorgeous. Everything was kept very clean and when we would come back to the room we will get restocked on complementary waters and also with toiletries And they were 100% organic with aloe vera and they were probably the best I’ve ever had in a hotel room. Wonderful first time experience in Hawai everything was very nearby in walking distance or short driving distance. I recommend for people that are going by themselves or as a couple or with friends or with family it’s a beautiful hotel,Jun 2022,June 2022,Traveled with family,,"Los Angeles, California"

Yes, the Ritz gives free leis but other than that it was no comparison. Half of our party stayed at the Ritz so I got to see what we were happy to pass up. The views and open windows at the Prince were spectacular. Very clean, great staff. We chose the 2 bedroom suite and fell in love! Not one complaint can be made!

843077777,40,Honeymoon luxury?,"The hotel staff are incredibly friendly. Laura at the front desk provided us with a lot of useful information. The room is incredibly comfortable. The open air is nice. It can get a little loud at night (especially with the harbor bar next door). We closed the windows one time because someone was vomiting on the street.    The hotel itself needs maintenance regarding the elevators- we had to use the service elevator for over 3 nights. Our room was right off the service door so we constantly heard people. One night we were in the main elevator with another couple and the elevator doors closed, the elevator bounced multiple times, and for a few moments we were stuck. Come to find out, a maintenance person and guest relations were “working on the elevator” trying to stop it- but no one had blocked the elevator from guests getting on.    The pool chairs are threadbare and there are not enough for the number of people staying at the resort or coming to the pool. There are also giant cockroaches that float in the overflow of the infinity pool which is a turnoff- we saw multiple.    We did eat at the hotel restaurant, but it’s nothing to write home about. The staff there were friendly but the food was just okay. Not worth the price",Jun 2022,June 2022,Traveled as a couple,,Maryland

842558935,40,Lovely place to stay,"I really like staying at the Prince. Great overall. I’ve stayed here before and was disappointed that they wouldn’t extend my stay at the same rate I’d booked when I forgot to add the last night on. So I felt rather poorly treated when I was told my options were to leave or pay the full rate for another night. I accept that I made a mistake in my booking, but after staying here several times in the past, and feeling “da aloha” here, that feeling is damaged.",Jun 2022,June 2022,Traveled on business,,
842469844,50,Insert title here,"The beach at Ala moana park is better than the ones at the Hilton because you can walk without being stabbed by 69,000 rocks. When I had concerns or questions, I just texted the front desk and they responded absurdly fast. They even gave us a microwave. That’s important, because our room didn’t have a kitchen. They’ve got a bidet for you with nice warm water. I hope you like seafood, because it’s pretty much all the food you can get at the hotel. Luckily for us, McDonald’s is a very short walk away. Don’t have a car? That’s only somewhat a problem. You can download the biki app and pay 30 dollars to rent a bike for 5 hours which you can use throughout the entire year. Not just one day or week or whatever. These biki stations full of bikes are almost on every street in Waikiki. You could also rent a scooter using a different app, but these scooters scare me and the value isn’t anywhere near as good. Back to the hotel, they have a nice outdoor pool which usually has a live entertainer or two in the evenings. Assuming kids aren’t being inconsiderate, it’s a very pleasant pool and hot tub. Honestly, you would probably have a great time at this resort, and I think it might be cheaper than the others.",Jun 2022,June 2022,Traveled as a couple,,

Loved the infinity pool. Only downside would be the breakfast at 100 Sails. For about $185 for 4 people, you would think they would provide variety of food and drinks. But instead, it was on par with free continental breakfasts offered at Holliday Inns or any other 2 star hotels. And you don't even get the view!

842214297,50,Pleasant stay,"It has been many years since my last visit to Oahu. Everything changed so much. We wanted to stay on the quieter side of Waikiki. So we chose Prince and it did not disappoint. We got the oceanfront room with great views of the harbor and ocean. Waking up to the ocean every morning was such a relaxing feeling. I love how our room windows were able to open so we could take in some fresh humid air once in a while. The staffs were helpful. However, the self parking lot gets full most of the time at night and we had to valet. Otherwise, the room amenities were good. Bed was okay but pillows were awful. I really like the split toilet and shower stall. We used the pool and infinity pool almost everyday. We will definitely return here for future visits.

At 6 am on a Sunday, we awoke to loud music being played at the volume typical of a party. It was the room directly above us. I had to call the front desk twice and it took them 45 minutes to finally go up there and ask the guests above us to stop blasting their music at 6 am on a Sunday morning.

Erin at 100 Sails restaurant took amazing care of us - give this ""breakfast angel"" a raise!! She went above and beyond. All food and drinks were amazing.    Cullen and Sean at pool bar a lot of fun.    Rented premium cabana at pool ... extras were nice (2 free drinks, tanning lotion, bottled water, and very nice charcuterie board). But was very surprised that a tip was expected on the price of the cabana (rental was $295 + tax) ... happy to tip on service and food/drink, but cabana? So tipped double on food/beverages but still left pool feeling guilty ... sorry to servers, Howard & Teri ... maybe we're not yet seasoned enough travellers to know the protocol.    Concierge very friendly but did not know the ins and outs of booking at Hawaii Prince Golf Course, affiliate of hotel ... we subsequently booked tee time ourselves online once back at room (found out they DO rent clubs, and 20% discount if you're staying at hotel - $159 for 18 holes and cart - and course beautiful and quiet).

837370127,30,10 nights,"We just stayed 10 nights at the Prince Waikiki. The best feature of this hotel was the pool it was never more than 80% capacity. They do have very old pool chairs and they are extremely uncomfortable. Now for the rooms... we had an ocean front room and we were on the 18th floor. This did allow for a nice sunset view of the marina side while standing in a certain spot in our room. It also came with the view of a dirt field. We were at the very edge of the tower. The rooms offer really NO storage space. They could have done better with this. It isn't fun living out of a suitcase for 10 days. The bed had springs and was extremely uncomfortable. We did not stay in a club room so no one ever text us or ever remembered our name as talked about in so many reviews. The room otherwise was spacious and the bidet was a nice touch. Our room was cleaned daily. I know everyone loves the coffee stand in this hotel, we disliked it and found the food mostly inedible. The hotel next store had a much nicer coffee house with yummy food options. The couple times we ate at the hotel were good but expensive. We didn't think the buffet had enough options to warrant the price even if the options they had were mostly good. We found the Chart House next door to be consistently good. The Harbor Pub around the corner had a great happy hour if you could stomach the filth of the place. The hotel location was very nice. We thought that overall the hotel was very clean.",May 2022,April 2022,,,

His professionalism, patience, accommodations, and customer service will be a reason I return to your hotel (besides enjoying the hotel alone).    It was a refreshing and simple process to check in and he answered all my questions. I had a hectic day that day and his aura was calming and full of hospitality with a warm welcome, it was peaceful - perfectly paired with the Hawaiian music in the background lol.    It is the Hotel's service that is so important.  I wanted your General Manager & Executives to recognize Andrew for his hard work, dedication, offering such a warm, hospitable presence where guests feel comfortable and delighted to stay at your hotel - and/also following up the next day when I went to the front desk, Andrew was nice to ask how my stay was and if there is anything he can assist if needed.    I have stayed at a lot of hotels in my lifetime and Andrew is one of the BEST front desk agent I have the honor to meet.

836573241,40,Just dont got to the Spa,"Overall, I did really like the hotel. Its away from the beach, which was fine as we ended up driving everywhere in Honolulu and Oahu in general, which is overall a very easily drive-able island. We had an ocean front room on the 22nd floor and the view was striking. The windows opening is also a nice touch for a high rise. The room was generally very nice, clean and updated, although there was some minor wear and tear.  The pool area was chic, but small, and very windy (which apparently is not rare, as the two buildings surrounding it create a wind tunnel effect). It was a bit strange that there were no umbrellas near the regular chairs, as this really should be standard for a pool scene. If you want shade, you have to pay 100-300 dollars for a shaded cabana type seat.  The spa really was terrible. I would give it 2 stars if I had to rank it alone. First of all, it is not a spa, it is a room next to the pool where they have two massage beds. My husband and I both got massages, which were hard to book because they never answer their phone. Once we did book them, it seems everyone was confused about what we wanted, even though we ordered straight from their online menu. My husband had a female therapist who was pretty decent, and I had a male therapist who was awful. Generally, its hard to get an awful massage, as most massages are usually pretty good, but this one was truly awful, almost to the point of being annoying. I dont know if this person was in training. After this experience, other people at the hotel told me of their bad massage experiences. The hotel should have higher standards on who they hire for these types of services.",Apr 2022,April 2022,,Ocean front room was nice.,"New York City, New York"
836547858,50,Wonderful stay!,"I stayed at the Prince Waikiki with my family this month and I cannot say enough great things about this hotel. From the moment we arrived, we were greeted outside and helped to the reception desk followed by a tour of the club lounge area and facilities. We stayed on the club floor which included access to the lounge with food and snacks and it was such a great decision- we visited daily for breakfast or snacks or a light lunch/dinner. Our room was perfect- very clean and comfortable and with an amazing view of the harbor area. The windows opened up which we loved. Every single staff member that we interacted with were so friendly and helpful- from the valet, to concierge to the lounge staff and gift shop. Concierge set the tone for a positive experience even before arriving- I interacted with them before our stay to make dining reservations and ask questions. They responded almost immediately and provided so much great information. They even helped get a bed guard for my kids and had it all set up in our room before we even checked in. As for the location- I felt it was really perfect. It was away from the crazy busy part of the strip and a close walk to the Ala Moana mall and Ala Moana park which we thoroughly enjoyed. We were able to travel around the island and found the hotel to be in a great location to get everywhere (we rented a car). If you make a trip to Honolulu I would highly recommend staying at Prince Waikiki.",Apr 2022,April 2022,Traveled with family,,"New York City, New York"

836411757,50,An Absolute Gem,"Look no further if you are looking for a hotel in the Waikiki area. This hotel checks all the boxes and exceeds expectations. It’s beautiful, modern, exceptionally clean, has a large & relaxing pool, comfortable & quiet rooms and views for days.  We thought the location couldn’t be better. It’s close enough to walk to Waikiki beach, shop and dine but also removed from the hustle & bustle. The large windows in the rooms open to let in the Hawaiian breeze which was an added bonus. It’s located near a mall and a beautiful park (which in our opinion had a better, more secluded beach than in the heart of Waikiki.)  The staff were friendly and attentive. I have two small criticisms : 1. The hotel lacked an authentic Hawaiian vibe and we did not receive leis upon arrival. 2. The pool chairs are wildly uncomfortable and are in need of replacement.

836174897,50,Super hotel,"Loved our stay. Had a club room which as well as having a high floor with a panoramic view of the ocean gave us club access. Breakfast, lunch, snacks, dinner and drinks including alcohol all included and well worth the money. Probably the best evening food we’ve had in any club lounge-the variety, portions and quality meant we never left the resort for dinner!    Rooms spacious and modern. Friendly staff both in the lounge but also around the hotel. Pool nice but maybe due to positioning (5th floor and between 2 buildings) always seemed to be quite gusty and windy. Good gym.    Used Charleys taxis for our airport transfers-flat rates, took credit cards, new vehicles and very professional drivers. Also used them for a tour of the north shore and east Oahu - knowledgeable driver/guide and great value at $65 per hour.    Waikiki beach is about a 15 min walk away. As others have said it’s pretty crowded and not as good as some of the others. Nice little lagoon next to the hotel where you can hire paddle boards, pedal cycles etc and further around (away from Waikiki) there’s a nice walk around Aloha park that takes you to the sea and another lagoon where you can watch the surfers and waves crash against the rocks.    Did a combined city tour with Pearl harbour with E-Noa tours which was well worth doing but if you want to do more than just the memorial and a few of the mainland exhibitions you need to be there on a longer tour.",Apr 2022,April 2022,Traveled with family,,"Cardiff, United Kingdom"

We booked through Costco travel and I mentioned in the reservation that we were celebrating our anniversary and my fiancés birthday, and the staff was kind enough to honor that and gave us a bottle of wine and cards. We had no complaints about the service, everyone was friendly and helpful. Thank you to all the staff! We loved having the option to order room service and the food was delicious.

My daughter and I stayed in a one bedroom, ocean view suite in the Ala Moana Tower and my relatives stayed in ocean view rooms in the other tower. All guests were pleased.    Pros:  -Great location in Waikiki, within walking distance of the beach and restaurants, and close to excursion pickups;  -Beautiful suites and rooms with floor to ceiling windows. I could roll over in my bed and look at the marina, the Pacific and just gaze at endless blue;  -Floor to ceiling windows in the living room giving a panoramic view;  -Pleasant accommodating staff;  -Nice pool area with a cool infinity pool and great alcoholic and kid-friendly drinks;    Cons:  -The room service options could be a lot better (Door Dash and Uber Eats were handy after a day of high energy excursions);  -Late checkout wasn’t available which is tough when you have an evening flight; and  -The shower water temperature only went to warm and not hot.    Tip: Try to get a room on the highest floor possible. If you’re too low, your view is more of the Marina than the ocean.",Apr 2022,April 2022,Traveled with family,,"Upper Marlboro, Maryland"

Thanks also to manager Claire for helping us find a good room.    There was some noise issue with a malfunctioning refrigerator, but they addressed the issue right away. We also heard some noise from one of the elevators (mechanical sounds) all night during the last night of the stay- a guest had gotten stuck in it for a minute the day before- not sure if it was related, but otherwise fast access. The architecture of the hotel with the scalloping ensures private views, and all rooms have great views.    The Japanese restaurant in the hotel is great. Room service was fanstastic.

One big perk with this place is the reasonable (for Waikiki) parking ($30.00 per day, come and go as you please). The pool area is very nice. One note about the pool area and the room. The pool closes at 10pm, and, when the windows were open, we could hear pretty much every conversation and the music down by the pool. This is Waikiki, so some noise is pretty much the norm. But, for new visitors to the area, it might be a surprise (bring earplugs if you want to turn in before 10pm). The Coffee and gift shops in the lobby are quite nice too.

My family and I stay here often usually about 4x’s a year, it’s usually booked under my auntys name because she was a prince preferred member until I recently became one. Most times I enjoy my stay here, this time it was quite embarrassing considering I have been recommending this place to everyone. My guest flew in from Atlanta and wanted that to experience the hype I have been telling them about this place. When It was time to make my reservations, I was quoted a totally different price over the phone when I had called earlier that day. I still decided to book because I know the service this staff usually gives having stayed here many times before so I wasn’t nearly as concerned asked for any possible upgrades was turned down. Asked for at least a late check out and not even that. Not even consideration for any alternatives just a constant disappointment. Even with that check in was slow because the machine to create key copies of wasn’t working at his desk so we had to wait for his colleague to become available.

This beautiful property on the harbor is well-maintained and definitely satisfied our dream of enjoying a warmer beach climate.    Appreciation goes out to the housekeeping person (sorry no name) who cleaned our room 3217 each day. He/she was so detailed and consistently good at their job, it was very noticeable when a substitute cleaned our room on that person's day off. Other most notable staff were concierge Noelani who was super knowledgeable and caring about helping two seniors find their way around Waikiki.    Our hotel package breakfast also brought us to the 100 Sails Restaurant every morning for amazing food and excellent service.

It was a short trip and I wasn’t sure how Covid might impact closures, so I wanted to stay somewhere beautiful and relaxing in case I wanted to stay in more. The minute I stepped into my room, I felt happy and at ease. The harbor/ocean view was gorgeous, and I loved that the windows could open up for a gentle breeze. There were times where I just laid down on my bed facing this view just to take it all in and relax. I also enjoyed the infinity pool and the view from there too. Room-wise, it felt spacious and the bathroom had everything I loved (warm Toto toilet seat 😆, nice pressure on the shower head, separate bath tub for a nice soak).  The staff was friendly, and the location was tops—you’re a 6 minute walk away from Goofy’s for breakfast and 13 min walk away from Ala Moana Beach (and the huge mall; be sure to stop by their Foodland for all the delicious poke!). I also tried the Go X electric scooter they had on location (be sure to get the flat rate and not the pay by minute rate).  I would totally stay here again!

830635611,50,Memorable hotel stay,"We decided to stay at The Prince hotel after looking for decently priced hotels in Waikiki. For the same nightly price as other hotels we were looking into, i really wanted to stay at The Prince, because I've heard many good things about the hotel. It was our wedding week, so The Prince hotel was perfect for us.    Immediately after booking, a staff member contacted me, asking if we were Kamaaina (a local), and I said I was. She told me that their Kamaaina rates would be a better deal, tha what I had originally booked. It was nice for them to give us a better deal. Communication with the hotel was really easy. They can just text back and forth if you ever needed anything.    Because it was our wedding week, I asked if they could do something special for our room. I had ordered Swan shaped towels with flower petals on our bed, a Charcuterie plate, and they were going to send us a bottle of champagne, but because my husband cannot drink alcohol, they were so nice, and gave us Sparkling Cider.    We stayed in a room that was perfect for my husband, who is in a wheelchair. Had a roll in shower with a seat, bidet toilet, and the room was so beautiful with the view of Waikiki Harbor and Ala Moana park. The sunsets were beautiful to see everyday from our room.    The hotel has 2 dining places (KatsuMidori - sushi, and 100 Sails (dine in with a view of the harbor. buffet on weekends) and there is Honolulu Coffee in the lobby. There is also 2 stores - one boutique and the other is like a convenience store). We ate at 100 Sails on our last night... they have the best buffet!    There is a pool too but we didn't check it out.    Every staff member we had dealt with, either in person or through messaging, was very wonderful. If you're going to spend your money on a great hotel, I highly recommend The Prince hotel!!!",Mar 2022,March 2022,Traveled as a couple,,"Honolulu, Hawaii"
830564899,50,A Trip to Remember,"After doing a ton of research on which of the many hotels in Honolulu to book, I ended up booking 2 club level rooms for 8 nights at the Prince Waikiki. As it's been 2 years since we've travelled, during which time my mom was diagnosed with stage 3 cancer, we especially wanted this to be a memorable trip for her. The Prince Waikiki is a gorgeous, luxury hotel located away from the busy streets of Waikiki but still close enough to drive a few minutes to all the restaurants. We checked in past midnight due to a flight delay. Our rooms of course were ready and waiting for us. We were pleasantly surprised that our rooms were connecting however a little worried that they were right in front of the elevators. Thankfully the elevators were surprisingly quiet. Thr connecting rooms made it so much fun for the kids to wander back and forth to grandma and grandpa's room and one of them always got to ""sleepover"". The view from the 33rd floor takes your breath away. It is stunning and truly so amazing to be able to watch the sunrise and sunset from our room every single day. It was also neat to watch the activity in the ocean, with the harbor right out front, seeing the little boats, cruise ships, cargo ships, and people attempting various water activities. The windows that open were also great although you have to be careful with the little ones. The room itself was spacious and comfortable with a sizable bathroom. The club lounge was well worth the added cost for our family of 5 and the grandparents. A filling breakfast, lunch, and dinner is provided every day along with wine, beer, juice, and snacks. I had made reservations for lunch and dinner for most of our 8 days in Hawaii, however ended up cancelling half of them and staying at the hotel to eat. The food was actually very good and it was nice after hanging out at the pool or after a long day of being out, to know that we had access to food through the lounge. As for parking, we joined the prince preferred program to have the resort and parking fees waived. Because our rental car was a beast, the hotel comped us valet parking which was a nice bonus! One thing that stands out to me is the staff at the Prince. Everyone was so kind, friendly, and helpful.  There are a few minor areas of improvement that I would like to mention:  • there is almost no storage space despite the large cabinet where the TV is. Of the 5 drawers, only 1 can really be used as the other drawers were dedicated to the coffee machine, ice bucket, safe, and mini-fridge. Since we were there for 8 nights and had young kids with us, we had a lot of stuff and no where to put it. Most of our clothes ended up staying in the luggage or in piles on the floor or on the table. It would have been nice to have more drawers to put our clothes in.  • club rooms with the included advertised personalized concierge services was a little confusing and was not explained upon check-in. I didn't see a concierge/club dedicated desk, maybe the signage was poor? It was a bit confusing about who concierge was. When you enter the lounge, there's a small desk with a laptop where the lounge staff greet you and take your temperature and verify your room number. Are they the concierge staff or are they lounge staff or both? Just all a little confusing.  • as previously mentioned, the food in the club lounge is actually really good. However, there really needs to be more variety when it comes to the sides. We got pretty tired of the mashed potatoes and steamed veggies.  • the hot tub is TINY. Could maybe fit 6 adults in there comfortably. The water is also not hot enough as other reviews have mentioned.  • this last feedback is the one thing that annoyed me the most. When we went down to grab a few drinks from the lounge (that is included in our club floor package) to bring out to enjoy poolside, we were told that we couldn't. We were told that lounge offerings weren't allowed to be brought out by the pool. After some hesitation, she told us that we could but we had to sit far away from the pool, out by the stage area. If this is truly the policy, it makes absolutely no sense. Why would club lounge food and drinks provided to us by the hotel itself be considered ""outside"" food and not allowed by the pool? What difference does it make if I eat or drink it near the pool area vs near the stage area?

830248012,50,Great cost-performance,"A great cost performance with a great service. Clean. Friendly staff. This place is wonderful for two reasons. 1. The parking is free if you do not use the valet. 2. If they have a room, you can extend your checkout time until 6 pm by spending 100 dollars. I have to say that this extended stay is the best! As you know, most flight back to the mainland is from 7 to 9 pm. So, 6 pm is truly great stuff. Do I have a complaint? Yes, the pool water can be increased. The two towers end up with a strong wind. So, the pool is chilly. Also, they can have a better chair. Also, it would be nice to have a more shaded area in the pool area.

Pros:  1) First off, we were celebrating birthdays and anniversary and the hotel provided a lovely note and chilled sparkling wine.  2) All of my pre-visit requests were honored including extra pillows and a higher floor.  3) My partial ocean view room could be seen if standing near the desk.  4) The in room local brand brewed coffee was high quality  5) The lotion/ soaps, etc are a local brand and very luxurious.  6) The room and king bed were very comfortable for two of us.  7) I went to morning yoga one day and the teacher was great!  8) Marina view from the pool at sunset was beautiful    Cons:  1) location- I didn’t get a car rental and intended to walk around Waikiki. I spent one day on the beach and the walk to sand/surf is about 15 minutes. The walk to most restaurants and shopping was 25-40 minutes and outings had to be planned since returning to the hotel for a brief rest or to pick up something wasn’t an option.  2) Last but not least, walking anywhere involved busy streets or the marina parking lot. The first night going out for dinner I took a few wrong turns. It seems the hotels really don’t want to connect via walkways because they probably don’t want more foot traffic. I finally found a beachfront pathway to get to main Waikiki area after a couple of days  3) In Marina parking lot and Hilton lagoon there were groups gathered in the evening with loud music and hanging out but I always felt safe and was never bothered by anyone.  4) I was surprised how much traffic noise carried up to my 20th floor hotel room with windows closed.  5) Some chairs near pool should be replaced; I spent one afternoon in hot tub and pool so wasn’t much of an issue    I didn’t eat at the hotel or use any spa treatments so can’t comment.",Feb 2022,January 2022,Traveled as a couple,Room on 20th floor surprisingly had a lot of noise from traffic.

Kornelia and Janae helped us with the task of finding a place for the PCR covid test required to return to Canada. This took a huge amount of stress away. Ward is the best beer pourer ever! They made us feel so welcomed everyday, they are awesome people. We visited the lounge daily as part of the club package, which I would highly recommend. Food is great along with wine, beer, soft drinks and water. Well worth it. We really don't like hunting for food in the morning so breakfast was easy, delicious and with a great view.    The concierge staff were also extremely helpful with printing of important documents and arranging for our airport taxi, Charlies Taxi which has a flat rate which is helpful especially when travelling during rush hour.

To say that Prince Waikiki exceeded our expectations is an understatement!!  Even before we arrived, we were texted to let us know that our room was ready and waiting for us and these intermittent communications continued throughout our stay (without being intrusive). We had a beautiful ocean view room with access to the club lounge which we’d highly recommend. We ate a delicious breakfast there each day before going off to explore and typically came back later in the day for snacks before visiting the luxurious pool. We took advantage of room service our first night and a poolside lunch on our day of checkout- both delicious and fresh. And we had free and easy parking nightly.

Easy fix turn up temperature to high and much warmer  The infinity pool was better views and temp but still can be increased due to the cool wind coming in between the two towers  The jacuzzi is where the problem is  Due to the frigid pools every heads to the 6 person hot tub!  So very Covid unsafe plus it has so much use it look like bath tub with a ring in it if skin and hair and lotion  Night time is impossible to fit in with two towers on people using it  They need to build a much much bigger jacuzzi somewhere like in the back where the music in the evening plays which is much under utilized area  The lounge chairs are so old that the sagging fabric makes u lay directly onto the metal bars  The pool deck is wood so combination of slippery but also ugly unvarnished areas  The service is nice but be prepared not even a outside can of water or food is permitted because they want u to buy from there bar only  Music is only Thur to Sun 5-7pm and in the dark and wind so sad to not appreciate the artists  Would be nice early in the day near towel bar area to appreciate and see and even get some hawaii music.

825131323,30,"Nicely appointed hotel with good employees, ruined by bad management","We booked out trip to Hawaii about 20 days before arrival for the busy Christmas/New Year's week. We selected the hotel for its location and ratings. The room was very clean and comfortable. The pool was small. I think we counted 27 chairs for BOTH towers of hotel rooms. They also had more premium seating by the pool that they wanted to charge and extra $120-$240 per day to use. I had a rental car and valet parked it. The valet attendants were very pleasant and helpful. When I called down however to have my car brought up, I was told ""they're busy, come down and give them your ticket yourself. I did, and there were two guys at the desk who didn't look all that preoccupied. It was the telephone operator who upon instructions from the manager, told us to deal with calling up the car ourselves.    On New Year's Eve, all of the restaurants and bars closed at 10:00 PM, effectively telling the guests to go elsewhere to celebrate. My adult family of four bought a six pack of High Noon's, and sat quietly outside at some hotel chairs socializing until the fireworks on the beach nearby. Hotel security approached us (we were not unruly or making any kind of a fuss), and asked us to take our beverages to our rooms. They said sitting there at 10:00 PM on NYE was a violation of Hawaii licensing rules. I asked them to consider the situation, with no bar open, no restaurant open, and the fact that we weren't bothering anyone.......and they responded by rallying 3 more staffers to stand around us and stare us down until we dispersed. Bad management, and certainly not hospitable.    I have also posted a photo of what their Concierge desk looked like. Now, this is arguably the busiest week of the year, and they couldn't rally one person to help two towers worth of guests with their needs??? Bad management.    I will say that the valet parking staff, and the restaurant and pool bar staff were very friendly and attentive, and the property was well maintained. It is just that the management were essentially unhospitable in the Hospitality business.",Jan 2022,December 2021,,Don't plan on doing much on property.

824922937,50,Excellent choice for Honolulu!,"I stayed at Prince Waikiki just before Christmas in 2021. My main concern was being a little far from Waikiki beach, but when I got there, I realized it wasn't an issue. Yes, it's pretty far to walk to Waikiki beach but Waikiki isn't the only beach you have in Oahu. So many choices. My family actually didn't swim as it was way too crowded but enjoyed our time in Kailua, Hanauma Bay, Ko'Olina beaches and lagoons. As it's a little far from the crowd, it's quite peaceful but at the same time, it's really close to Ala Moana mall, which is about 5 minutes walk from the hotel. The hotel is sparkling clean, esp. in guest rooms. We had one bedroom ocean front room, and it was quite spacious and had a great view of Ala Moana beach and harbor. The sunset from the room was amazing! The parking structure is smaller to the size of the hotel, but once the self-parking runs out, they park your car in valet parking free of charge. Every employee I met there was kind and welcoming. The other positive thing about the hotel is they waive resort fee and self parking fee once you sign up for their membership. Other hotels in Oahu charge $$$ for resort fee and parking. Highly recommend staying in Prince Waikiki.",Jan 2022,December 2021,,,Philly

They gave us a discount for a local florist to deliver flower petals that they spread in the shape of a heart on the bed. My wife was thrilled!    Everyday they have doormen who attend to your needs and concierge is very helpful with any requests you have. The shop on the lobby floor is great for quick snacks and drinks. We got drinks and a pastry from the Cafe each morning. The cappuccinos and almond croissants were delicious!    We had a car for some of the days and parking was a breeze.    The pool was fun and the servers out there always took care of us. We had takeout sushi at Katsumadori since we couldn't get a reservation (they book out weeks to months in advance) which was good. Had breakfast and lunch once at 100 sails. The service is EXCELLENT. Our waters never went empty and the food was delicious. A bit pricey but to be expected.

824763792,20,"Stayed in the two bdr waterfront suite, housekeeping entered into room to clean when I had DND sign up","I stayed in the 2 bdr waterfront suite for five days. The room itself was beautiful.    I knew from the start of my stay that I did not want house keeping to come and clean my room as I didn't want to have to put away my clothes, valuables and toiletries everytime before housekeeping came. So I had the ""Shhh do not disturb"" sign on the front of my door since Day 1. Day 4 I asked front desk to send up TP, body wash and bottles of water and I told them specifically to leave it outside my door as I did not want them to come in while I was out. When I came back to my room after being out for 3 hrs, I saw that not only did they enter my room without permission (DND sign was on the door), they cleaned my room and bathroom. They touched my bikini bottoms, underwears and clothes around, they moved my toiletries including my makeup brushes and beauty blender. However what is bizarre is that they moved all my stuff around but there was still hair on the bathroom sink, on the countertop table in my room, crumbs still on the dining table?!    I felt violated, they did not care for the sign on the door, they came in, moved my things around, touched my personal items, and ""cleaned"" but they didn't even do a thorough job cleaning?? They did this without my permission - the one rule at hotels is if the DND sign is up, you DO NOT enter. like come on    I immediately called front desk to complain about the situation, they told me to hold while they transferred me to housekeeping. I had to explain the whole situation again to the housekeeping who answered the call, only for her to transfer me AGAIN to housekeeping manager where I had to relay the whole situation AGAIN. That's 3 times. That's unacceptable. Front desk you are meant to deal with complaints, handle it behind the scenes and then come back to me with a resolution, NOT have me deal directly with housekeeping. There is no accountability here. For the price I paid for 5 nights for a 2 bdr suite, this is unacceptable.    Housekeeping manager told me that she'll consult with her team and call me back. She called me back saying sorry and that she understood - she explained that because it's a 2bdr suite, one door did not have a sign and one door did have a sign, that the housekeeper just assumed all rooms needed cleaning and that it's treated as one?!?! That makes absolutely no sense.  1) Why the blatant disregard for the sign that is hanging on the door?    2) If the suite is treated as ONE entity then how come I had to check in twice for both bedrooms on day 1? One room I checked in when I arrived in the morning, and then I had to check in again in the afternoon when the second room was ready. Make it make sense? 2 different key cards for 2 separate bedrooms with 2 different checkins and then housekeeping treated it as 1???    3) You can't undo what's been done. If the housekeeping was unsure whether to clean the room or not, I'd rather they NOT do anything then ask whether to clean the room when I've come back. Rather than operate on assumption, clean the room and move my things around WHEN THE DND SIGN IS ON THE DOOR! The latter cannot be undone and I felt violated and the trust is broken. I had all my valuables out as well. If I had known the housekeeping was coming I wouldve' put them in the safe. This incident did not make a safe and trustworthy environment for me.    They offered apologies but otherwise nothing else. Very upsetting part of the stay in what was otherwise a lovely trip to Hawaii.

We picked this place cause of the pool as we planned to spend time relaxing there as we weren't comfortable doing anything touristy around crowds during these times. We paid the premium price for the room and resort fee and have been to numerous other hotels in Hawaii in December where swimming wasn’t an issue.  - Pool menu didn’t have many snacks or appetizers and outside of the blackened ahi tacos the food and drinks weren’t good at all. We don’t mind paying high prices at a nicer hotel but to get subpar products is very frustrating.  - Way too strict at pool: infinity curve only 16 and up which can understand not wanting them young kid but a 10 year old with his father and no one else in it and getting shooed out plus no outside drink even a kid thermos for water or chips is too much for a place we’re paying a lot to be guests at.  - Pool chairs: were old and warn out and torn. Sagged so very uncomfortable with the metal beams poking through.  - Had a coupon as part of our booking. Didn’t get it at check in and then when we went back to the desk they told us it could be used every day but the people at the pool argued with us then checked and said we’re right.  - Sheets on the bed were scratchy — pillows were nice and soft though.  - Walk ways away (~30 minutes) to the main area of Waikiki shops and beach    Some pros and cons to weigh here if this is the right place for you.",Dec 2021,December 2021,Traveled with family,,"Sunnyvale, California"

I had to call the front desk and ask for it. With similar price, I would think I could get much better service with other hotels around.",Dec 2021,December 2021,,,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania"

Front desk and workers are friendly and very efficient in resolving any problems. If we come back to Oahu I think we would stay here again. Service in this hotel way better than those chain hotels such Hyatt, Hilton , Marriott n etc. Its a little bit of walking to many restaurants but we had a car so it wasn’t issue for us. If you want to see things you need a car in this island. They don’t have beach umbrellas and chairs but we didn’t stay in Waikiki all the time. There are so many beaches you want to visit in this island.",Dec 2021,April 2021,Traveled as a couple,,"Chicago, Illinois"

822412644,50,Gorgeous View,"I stayed on the 16th floor and man, what a view! The floor to ceiling windows make for a stunning sunrise and sunset view. The top half opened to let in a perfect breeze. I picked up a bath bomb and had the most relaxing soak in the full sized tub. Every detail of the bathroom is awesome. Gorgeous shower with pleasant soaps, the heated toilet seat/bidet, the makeup mirror with automatic light. There are plenty of outlets throughout the room, so anyone and everyone can charge their devices on the outlets that are also equipped with USB ports. I honestly didn't even turn on the tv, because the sound and ambiance with the window open is perfect for sleeping, getting ready, working, relaxing.    The staff is remarkable. Given the current pandemic climate, everyone somehow still manages to be incredibly helpful and friendly. The crew at Honolulu Coffee Company is wonderful.  They remembered my order after only taking it once. They have terrific food options and I’ve snagged a couple treats to take with me on my daily adventures.    Front desk has been super accommodating, helped me extend my stay (that’s how great this place is!), provided quick help with the gym key card, explained policies, and quickly helped with a maintenance issue.    The valet team was also very helpful. CT took the time to listen to my reason for being in town and provided exceptional advice and pro tips. He quickly got my car parked and brought my ridiculous number of suitcases up. He also provided a thorough walk through of my room, showed me how to use the remote for the blinds (SO COOL), and reiterated the places to check out in town.    The entire stay was better than words and I highly, highly recommend.",Dec 2021,December 2021,Traveled on business,,

822303374,50,Just spot on,"I really love this hotel. Stayed here again with club access and an ocean front room. Location was great for a 10k run my wife and her friend went on. A bit of a walk to Waikiki. Quite close to the big mall. This hotel is not on a beach.    Everything they offer is done well. Service is particularly amazing. Lots of little things, for example, am sitting outside at the club area and one of the hostesses comes out to let us know they are switching over from the lunch to dinner items, did we want anything from the lunch tray before they did? Seems like a little thing but this happened over and over.    Room wasn't big but loved the view and able to slide open the window to get fresh air. Finally, a hotel with smaller, comfortable pillows. Thank you! Electronic toilet seat not really my thing but some may like it ... perhaps for Asian guests, and perhaps their attention to detail and respectfulness with guests has that sensibility as well??? We did not eat at the restaurants there other than snacking at club floor and having a bottle of champagne we ordered and paid for from the bar brought over, which they willingly did, for us to consume there.    I would comment that this time of year a lot of restaurants get booked way way in advance.    They had a little Christmas bar popup outside which was nice.    One thing, please don't be like some of the tourists who insist our mask mandates shouldn't apply because in their home state it isn't practiced. Hawaii has had one of the lowest rates because of these measures. Please, we value you coming but some respect to local staff and guests. I couldn't believe one guest who in the club floor refused to wear a mask inside by the food bar and insisted on yelling to his wife outside while standing in front of food that would be consumed by other guests. Wow.",Dec 2021,December 2021,,,"Kohala Coast, Hawaii"
822217288,50,Great stay,"My husband and I chose this hotel because it was highly recommended by our son who had gone in July. We were very pleased with our choice. The view from our room was picture perfect and the unique ""lanai"" -allowed us a wonderful sunset every day from every vantage point. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom with separate tub, shower and toilet stall was pleasing and we liked the heated seat and bidet. The staff made us feel like family, welcomed and pampered. I think the staff are a big asset to the hotel and a big part of the hotel's success. The only inconvenience was that we had to keep calling housekeeping for replacement coffee and toiletries as the room was understandably cleaned every 3 days due to the pandemic. Because our room was in front of the elevator, there was a constant though muted whooshing sound in the night that seemed like a storm outside. The stay overall was wonderful and we would definitely return again.",Dec 2021,December 2021,,,"Cupertino, California"

The service continues to be very good but this time we noticed the food quality was down and prices up. Almost $30 for a hamburger on a soggy sweet roll poolside. Room service was good in the morning and appreciated the take out at Katsumidori.  The rooms are getting tired. Ours was super dusty - you could write your name in the dust on surfaces in the room. The carpets are worn and baseboards are pretty beat up. Even the hallways look tired.  We stayed in the DH Tower this time - I prefer the Ala Moana Tower.

821944600,50,Well-appointed & Situated Luxury Hotel with Excellent Service,"Entering the festively adorned lobby of Prince Waikiki I knew I was embarking on a nice staycation. I was allowed an early check-in and late check-out which was great because I didn't want to leave!    My room on the 16th floor offered a gorgeous view of the ocean Ala Wai harbor, and Ala Moana park. It was an ideal side of the building because it was still cool with the windows opened. Though there is no lanai/balcony there is a set of windows that open fully to savor the fresh air and stunning view. The automatic shutters are very convenient to provide shade from the sun or complete blackout for those mornings I wanted to sleep in.    The hotel is situated in a location convenient to shopping, entertainment and dining, and beaches with just a short walk. On the ewa (west) side of the property there is Ala Moana Beach Park, beach and shopping center. On the Diamond Head (east) side the iconic Waikiki awaits you including the Kahanamoku Lagoon, the perfect spot to relax in the sun. The Ala Wai boat harbor is on the makai (ocean) side.    There is self parking or valet parking at the hotel. The staff is very helpful and friendly and I liked that there was a texting platform to make requests. That was very convenient and preferred when I didn't feel like talking to anyone.    The room itself is very well appointed and comfortable from the king bed, 5 pillows, bolster, ample outlets for those electronics and laptops, a refrigerator, large screen TV with remote controllable from your phone, comfortable robes and slippers. The bathroom with marble floors was sizeable with separate and private toilet room, bath tub, separate shower, and single vanity, complete with Malie Hawaiian amenities such as moisturizing face and body soap, shampoo, conditioner, skin cream, dental kit and shaving kit. They even had a skin care set and bath salts (extra). I asked for a microwave oven throughout my stay which was provided at no extra cost.    The spa, pool, deck, and fitness center are all on the 5th floor. The pool and deck were especially impressive with rentable cabanas, a bar, hot tub, swimming pool and heated infinity pool which is absolute bliss while watching the sunset.    Restaurants onsite include 100 Sails with a bountiful Sunday brunch, and Katsu Dori Sushi (reservations highly recommended for the latter). I enjoyed in-room dining for breakfast, and the onsite Honolulu Coffee Company (6am-2pm daily) for my coffee fix.    As a Prince Preferred Member there are extra perks such as waived resort fee, discounts on parking, the spa, room service etc., and bottled water daily. An added bonus at this hotel is the Mahalo card which you can apply for and enjoy discounts on restaurants, parking and golf!    Prince Waikiki is one of the few hotels on Oahu that allows me to bring my pet ($250 one time cleaning fee). It was a wonderful stay and I look forward to returning soon!",Dec 2021,December 2021,Traveled solo,Sign up for Prince Preferred and the hotel's Mahalo Card for extra perks!,"Honolulu, Hawaii"

From start to finish, everything was first class, the staff was genuinely warm and welcoming, and we did not have one bad experience. During a 10 day stay, you have the opportunity to see everything - we did - and it was all wonderful. The Prince Waikiki is within easy walking distance to all of the attractions of Waikiki, but far enough away so that you will have a peaceful nights sleep.

821283346,40,Very nice hotel,"The hotel was very nice. The room was beautiful and very clean. My only complaint about this hotel is that its back patio (where it’s nice to have your morning coffee or a drink) is open to the many homeless people in Honolulu. After spending a pretty penny on the room and the resort fee, I was not expecting to have coffee every morning with homeless people. Additionally, though this isn’t the hotel’s fault, the water right next to the hotel is full of garbage, so it isn’t very pretty when walking around. On the other hand, the hotel’s location makes it an easy walk to the Ala Moana mall, which has many many great stores.

821215167,40,"Nice hotel, not luxury!","This is a beautiful hotel with mostly very gracious service, but I would not call it luxury by a long shot.  I added a full star for the fact that the windows open!  Hooray for ventilation and treating guests like competent adults! 👏👏👏  The views and grounds are gorgeous, especially the pool - but it closes early, and the bar and restaurant there closes ridiculously early. Also annoying that there was no shade there unless you rented a cabana for hundreds of dollars when you already rented a room for hundreds of dollars.  Sweltering in the day, closed in the night = unusable by green eyed me.  The sails restaurant was wonderful in every way, but room service shuts down early. I ordered a salad with prawns and it showed up looking, to my horror, that someone had taken a bite out of the thing with a shrimp decapitated and half missing.  They asked what they would they should do about it! Ive worked in hospitality. The answer is to replace the offending dish asap and also remove it from the bill, especially when the accumulating bill is getting into the tens of thousands! We ended up eating at the mediocre chart house downstairs many times.  The door men and valets stand out as exceptionally warm and helpful, as was the security guy who helped me with my safe (and warned me earnestly not to visit the nearby beach alone at night, and I confirmed this, so don't you either) but some employees seemed either clueless or aloof when we asked for things.  Summary - great place if you're expectations aren't high.    You will have to take care of yourself at kids bedtime, so I recommend stocking your fridge if you tend to be more of a night person. Believe me, you don't want to find yourself wandering Waikiki starving or searching for a salad at night when you've been drinking.",Dec 2021,December 2021,Traveled with friends,,

We had a 15th floor oceanfront room- trippy that you can open the windows all the way.

Also self parking spaces are very limited, however they offer free valet if the parking structure is full.

Just a couple examples of why we chose this hotel: 1) Parking is included if you are a Prince Member and if the lot is full you can Valet for free; and 2) Water was replenished daily. Keep up the excellent service! THAT'S WHY PRINCE IS THE #1 HOTEL ON TRIP ADVISOR.",Nov 2021,November 2021,,,"Escondido, California"

Everywhere else seemed very touristy, but Prince was an excellent alternative. The hotel is nicely designed, the staff is great, and the rooms are really nice. Our Oceanfront Premiere room on the 28th floor had a jaw-dropping view that really made the whole stay, for a price that seemed too good to be true, but wasn’t.

817493614,10,The worst club lounge I've ever encountered.,"There are so many bad things about this hotel.    I'm a seasoned traveler and have stayed in countless hotels. I like to splurge when I travel and love relaxing in a club lounge. I've stayed in many Prince hotels in Japan and they all offer excellent to great club lounges, so that's the main reason I chose the Prince Waikiki.    What's wrong with the lounge? Let me count the ways.    First of all, their furniture is far from luxurious. There are several outdoor patio tables and chairs, just standard patio furniture many people have in their backyard. In addition, they have several indoor seatings that look and feel like college dormitory furniture.    Their alcohol drink selection is unbelievably limited. Only two kinds of beer and house red and white wine! I knew that they only served beer and wine but I assumed that they have many kinds to offer. I was shocked that they offer only a house wine! Unacceptable.    The first night, we tried their ""dinner"". It was a small plate of green salad and fried pork belly with steamed vegetables and rice. Ok, so this fried pork belly was 90% fat and I could not stomach it after one bite. The kicker is that this was the only item that was served. Come on! In this day and age, what health-conscious people eat that garbage? The vegetables and rice were tasteless as they were just steamed. There were no appetizers we could have either.    The next morning, we thought we'd give them another chance and went for breakfast. Well, it was better than the previous night's dinner but the menu was just strange. We could choose scrambled eggs, fried rice, miso soup, fruits, pastries, cereal, and pastries. I chose scrambled eggs, fried rice, miso soup, and fruits. They were barely edible and served at room temperature, sigh. The pineapple was good, though. It's hard to mess up Hawaiian pineapple, lol.    So we stayed away from the lounge despite paying so much for lounge access until our last night to get a drink. We got wine and asked if they had any appetizers. The only thing they had to offer were bags of potato chips. At this point, we just laughed as this was beyond pathetic.    The room we stayed in, the Oceanfront Premier was not premiere at all. It was dated and musty. The bathroom had no vent so the whole room smelled. Thank God the window opened. The shower and bathtub were shockingly tiny with very low water pressure.    I wouldn't complain this much if I stayed in a cheap hotel and not paid much but our room was $600/night and I truly feel we got ripped off. So never ever again, Prince Waikiki!    I must say that the manager Ethan Fishbane wanted to make things right by giving us an upgrade for 2 nights in their suite. So I do thank Ethan for that. I'd like to recommend to him to visit club lounges of the hotels nearby and how they operate. And if you ever have a chance, go to the Prince Gallery Kioicho in Tokyo and go to their lounge.    I sincerely hope that this review will prevent some travelers to avoid this hotel at all costs.",Nov 2021,October 2021,,,Tokyo and California

815312329,50,We're definitely coming back!,"Two years ago, I took my wife to Hawaii for the first time and stayed here. After that stay, we knew we’d be back. During our stay, we met Howard. He was kind and attentive and provided all the local knowledge one can provide.    This time my wife and I and 5 other friends stayed at the Club Level.    Prince Waikiki ensured we had a trip and wedding of a lifetime. Here are some highlights of why:    Concierge - Emma did an amazing job of working with our friends to ensure finishing touches were complete for our wedding day as we got ready. She went above and beyond to ensure we had everything we needed to successfully make it out the door.    Hinina Bar- The reason we are back is Howard. 2 years later and a little memory jog and Howard remembered us. You would think after a pandemic and honestly, 1000s of customers coming thru that one wouldn’t remember. Howard was a joy to chat with about all the local knowledge. Terri and Maria made sure our drinks were never empty. Terri and Maria took care of all 7 of us the day after our wedding at the poolside cabanas. Drinks were always flowing and it was a day to remember with our wedding crew.    Club Lounge - Mari, Noleen, Janae, Cornelia did an amazing job taking care of all 7 of us the first week or our stay and 2nd week. They remembered our orders and just went above and beyond to make the trip special.    Bell/Valet Crew: George, Travis, Neal did a great job with helping us in and out to the next activity. George even helped us get all the things ready and loaded onto our Party Bus that took us to the wedding ceremony and back.    HouseKeeping: They did a wonderful job taking care of our room - especially after a few tornados going thru it with getting ready for the wedding. There was never a hesitation in making sure our room was ready during our 2-week stay.    Feedback:  We had one instance of one of our party guests who was a club guest having trouble accessing the club lounge due to an incorrect type of room key provided at check-in (it was a late evening check-in). Security came thru questioning her versus asking her what her room number is to verify she's at club level.",Oct 2021,October 2021,,,

So this time being our second time during 2021 coming to the prince we have definitely seen a big improvement! We had such a fantastic stay, though some of the remaining results have still affected some of the operations we were normally used to we were still very satisfied.

812474005,30,annoyed and disappointed,"I don't think I would stay here again. You guys can decide for yourselves. I am so tired of hotels advertising amazing restaurants and bars on their property only to find out that it is impossible to access them because they are solidly booked. The explanation is that they are separate entities and separate from the hotel. I think it's false advertising. This has now happened to me several times and it happened here with the Sushi restaurant. The concierge couldn't help us and what's more had trouble recommending other sushi restaurants in Honolulu. But this is minor and we found an amazing place in town called Wasabi Bistro and I would go there again in a heartbeat.    After going through the appropriate and required verification of vaccine status I was surprised that the hotel did not have their computer system configured so that we wouldn't have to repeatedly do that for absolutely everything. I usually don't take my ID to the pool but please remember to do that because even though you are outside, and even though you went through verification when you checked in and have your room key, you still will be asked for your ID and vaccine proof when you are in your wet bathing suit in order to get a coke.    I wanted to use the gym but the room key did not work. I went down to the front desk to ask why. They said, ""oh, you need a separate key for the gym."" I thought, OK, why didn't you tell me that when I checked in. Before they handed me the gym card though they asked "" are you vaccinated."" It kind of set me off.    They did mention that there would be no daily maid service due to safety precautions for the staff. I am all for that. But I do think they should replenish the keurig coffees daily, otherwise you are out of luck and can't take advantage of that .  We stayed in a club room. The room was very nice and is the main reason for the 3 star review. The staff were also very nice. The hotel has a lot of concrete and although they try to soften it up it still is a little brutal. We liked being off the main strip of Waikiki. It is one of the reasons we choose it and it was a delightful walk to Waikiki when you wanted to go there. The convenience of having meals at the club lounge was great. The pool area was not as nice as the pictures suggest but pretty good.

812470346,40,Would not purchase upgrade to club floor amenities again!,"Just checked in yesterday and we’ve been very impressed with all that the Prince has to offer. Check in was splendid, assisted by Pamie at the reception area. She very graciously greeted us when we walked in to see the property and helped us to choose a room and make a reservation for the same day, and patiently explained so much about the hotel! Our room is immaculate and very pretty. Several nice restaurants on and around the grounds. Pool area is really beautiful and kept very clean. Staff around the pool area area circulate frequently and are happy to help with any they can offer to make you more comfortable. The service there is fantastic! We upgraded to the club floor, though, and the service we have been receiving there has really been lacking. The servers almost seem put out by our presence. It seemed like a nice option at the time to be able to go to the club area (which is adjacent to the pool) for cold drinks or a snack but you are not able to take anything away, not even bottled water. If you are damp from the pool area you won’t want to go into the Club and will then have to pay the regular charge for anything you order by the pool. If you are in the Club, which can be rather hot at certain times of the day when the sun shoots straight in, you can’t enjoy the shade and breeze which can be found just a few steps outside the door with your (also very limited) snacks and beverages. Also, servers in the club area do not check on patrons often at all. Slow to greet, not eager to explain what options are available and we notice that empty cups and plates just seem to linger on the table the entire length of our stay as though they are waiting to clear everything in it’s entirety until we depart. It’s very poor service while you are watching the wait staff around the pool area give fantastic service to the patrons just outside the barrier. I would save the $100+ per day upgrade and just enjoy what you want in the area of the hotel you most prefer until they figure this out.

The Club Lounge allowed for private access to the facility and it was worth every dollar. This is a great location for the beach, park and high end shopping at the Ala Moana Shopping Center.

810954076,50,Prince Waikiki,"10 days at the Prince in September, 2021. The good. the bad, and the ugly.  The Good:  The hotel overall was excellent. From the lobby to the room, everything was first rate.The front desk and concierge were accommodating, courteous, and efficient. We had booked a harbour view room, but when we entered the room it was right above the pool, there was a palm tree in our view, and the blinds did not work correctly. We contacted management and they rectified this immediately by moving us to a higher floor which we felt was much improved. There is an ABC store across the street as well as a Macdonalds nearby. Several restaurants are within a minutes walk from the hotel. The pool area was lovely.  The BAD:  Nothing that bad. Just a few eyebrow moments. The elevators were, on occasion, very slow. Especially seeing that one of the elevators appeared not to be working for most of the time we were there. It was a minor issue, but surprising for the quality of the hotel. From our room we could hear the elevators moving up and down. It wasn't loud enough to be annoying, but it was audible. We knew ahead of time where the hotel was located, but be prepared for the a good 20 - 30 minute walk to get into Waikiki. We enjoy walking, so it wasn't an issue for us, but for some, it might be a concern. There are several beaches within a 10 minute walk from the hotel, so no issues about going to a beach from the hotel. The pool water could have been a tad warmer, but overall the water was fine.  The UGLY:  Nothing with regard to the hotel, but should you walk to the beach along the marina, you will see all the garbage in the water in the marina. It is a shame that they do not clean this up. We live in an area where there are many marinas, and yes there can be some garbage found in and around the boats, but nothing like what we saw at this marina. You would think that of all places, Hawaii, they would make sure that their waters are clean or at least cleaned.",Sep 2021,September 2021,,,"Vancouver, Canada"

810647419,50,Great location and wonderful club lounge service!,"We had a great time at the Prince! We were checked in by the very friendly Teppei who gave me a wonderful introduction to the hotel as well as a welcome bag as a gift. The best part of our stay was the Club lounge. Kornelia was phenomenal and well supported by Miki, Mari, Noeleen, Ward, and Shawn. They made each visit to the club lounge a treat and we felt like VIPs! For anyone trying to enjoy a resort-like experience, I highly recommend upgrading to a room on a club floor. Portion sizes are generous and the food is tasty!    The gym and pool area were fantastic! You didn’t ever feel like any area was too busy or crowded and during the pandemic this is a major plus!    The Prince is conveniently located just ten minutes walk from the Ala Moana Center which has many stores and a Target! This made us feel at ease because if we needed something small that we forgot at home, we could walk over to the mall and pick it up without spending a fortune.

The room/bathroom was good sized, clean, and had a nice view (unfortunately obstructed/restricted due to the architecture of the building) over the harbour/ocean.    Professional, friendly service, really felt like a hotel, even in covid-times.    We got a club room, and enjoyed the higher floor/better view, and specially the service in the club lounge. Though somewhat restricted due to covid (no buffet), it felt great having ""an outdoor club room with a view, and with great service"". From 7am to 8pm they serve bento-box-style breakfast, a small lunch, and a surprisingly very good dinner. It gave us an ""extra room to stay"", and we didn't have to go look for a restaurant.    Location: At the end of Waikiki, about 20 minutes walk from the ""high life"", felt safe and the room was rather quiet.

Although not directly on the beach, the beach is within walking distance. There are nice swimming areas protected from the waves in the neighboring Ala Moana Park, which is next to the hotel. The pool at Prince Waikiki is lovely and we enjoyed the infinity pool- it was not too crowded and there is ample seating, though not much shade. The pool restaurant and service were excellent. Other niceties: great coffee shop in the lobby- I recommend the açaí bowls. Heated toilet seats, similar to those that are common in Japan- we should all have this amenity!

806572724,50,Amazing hospitality,"Our family of 4 just came back from a week long vacation in Oahu celebrating my son's birthday. We stayed at the Prince Waikiki for 4 nights and had a fantastic time. Despite being a Hilton Diamond member, I wanted to try out a different hotel this time and boy am I glad I did!  The property is modern and clean with decent amenities and in a great location. We were greater by a card and apple cider upon entering our room with a stunning view of the harbor.    However, what stood out the most is the genuine hospitality from its staff.    To name a few, Claire, the concierge assistant manager, whom I had initially approached with a complaint, not only was compassionate while hearing about the mishap from a precious staff member, but went above and beyond to make sure the rest of our stay was perfect. She even sent a personal email prior to her days off to make sure my family and I were taken care of.    Pammy & Jayden who arranged and got us checked in early was friendly and started us with a great impression of the hotel.    The bellman were efficient and friendly too.    But the MVP of our stay were BEE & CARINA. (These two were worth the hassle of retrieving my lost tripadvisor password.) They were the two people we spoke with most over the phone. The phone never rang more than two rings before either of them picked up with the most polite and friendly voice. Carina was very mindful of us traveling with two kids and kept me posted on the situation when we brought to their attention about the loud music continuing through the wee hours of the night from another room. He called me on my cell phone to insure that my sleeping children wouldn't wake up. Every other request made through her was also promptly taken care of.  And BEE.. now he deserves a medal. He remembers every little detail whether it be us having to reschedule our room cleaning because my daughter fell asleep, or what time I had mentioned we wanted to check out days before. He made sure I was connected to the facilitate but not just transferring the phone but getting the other person on the line before doing so. His genuinely kind and courteous demeanor along with the impeccable attentention to detail truly elevated the hospitality experience every hotel establishment should have.

Location is at the front end of Waikiki beach, away from the hustle and bustle of the strip’s shops, restaurants, and beach activities.

803967974,40,Nice hotel but receptionist didn’t believe I stay there,"We just checked this evening for 5 nights stay, so far so good in our oceanfront premier room. I think the only difference with the harbour front room is it is on higher floor.    I wish the receptionist could be more sensitive and thoughtful. I dropped my wife to check in at the lobby and went to park my car with my 7-year-old daughter. My wife gave them my ID and COVID-19 test/vaccine proof. She got the keycard and texted me the room number. I didn’t know which tower room 2309 was so I asked the receptionist. He asked if I was delivering food (I was carrying two beach towel bags). I told him we are staying here and that my wife already checked us in. He then asked me twice why I didn’t check in together with my wife. He asked for my ID, then I had to explain it again and finally he settled with the proof of my Hawaii health form. I was with my 7-year-old at 10PM delivering food? It would have been easier if I just looked for the room myself instead of asking help!! I know he was doing his job, so I wasn’t too upset. I was upset that he doubted me twice even after I told him I was parking the car.    Nice:  - pretty quiet on this side of Waikiki. We left the window open and listened to ocean wave.  - room is spacious, clean, with simple and chill ambience.  - the tv has netflix app which is common these days but I like you can control the tv with your phone without touching the usual remote control  - I saw katsumidori sushi restaurant in this hotel! We visited this chain a lot back in Tokyo and going to try its affordable and fresh sushi again here. It’s been 2 years and we hope it is as good here.    Not as nice:  - looks like due to COVID-19, they don’t offer luggage transport service all the way to the room now?  - car park space is very limited. I got lucky enough to take one of the last two spots, but looks like using the valet would be safer.  - shower room is a bit outdated",Aug 2021,August 2021,Traveled with family,,"Sunnyvale, California"

The suite I stayed in was beautiful and modernized, especially the view from the suite was great to wake up to every morning. The pool deck has a great view as well. 10 out of 10 I will stay here again. The only con about my stay was the fact that the coffee cups in my room were dirty with left over coffee inside. I was disgusted because there was mold growing in the cup. Did not notice till the last day when I check out. overall I had a great experience.",Aug 2021,August 2021,,,

803448657,50,Wow - Terrific Hotel,"The Prince Waikiki certainly lived up to expectations - wow! I was almost talked out of staying here as someone claimed that it was too far out from the center of Waikiki. To the contrary, it is nicely located away from the noise and just a ten minute nice walk to the beaches. We stayed on the 25th floor and had a lovely view of the marina and ocean. The employees are very nice and always gave us a bottle of water at the reception when we asked. And we really liked the coffee shop in the lobby too. The kids really got a splash out of the Japanese toilet - no pun intended. Duck tip: join the Price Preferred club for free and enjoy free parking and no resort fee (hopefully that deal still exists). The only disappointment was the restaurant - 100 Sails. I ordered the crab roll and was dismayed to find it with a lot of mayo and not much crab. The waitress was very nice but rather busy with all of the tables so I did not send it back. Plus, the meal was free since we had a $100 dining credit with our stay. But no excuse for a lack of crab. Ok, back to business at hand - the hotel is fantastic, nice staff, great location, and a lot of good deals out there if you do your research. Any Hawaii tips - I am happy to help.

803256808,50,Wonderful Stay,"We stayed in a suite. It was spacious, clean, nicely decorated, with nice robes and slippers, and spectacular views (on one side is Waikiki beach to Diamond Head, on the other is Magic Island and Ala Moana Beach Park, and in the middle is the yacht club where you see all the different boats plus a mega-bonus of being able to spot sea turtles swimming next to the boats. The best part, however, was that all the windows opened to allow the lovely trade winds to gently and naturally cool the rooms—AMAZING!    The fire alarm in our room did go off one morning, so I called the front desk, who sent a security person to check. The security person was very nice, although I think he was there to make sure we weren’t smoking. Still, not a big deal because he was so nice and explained why the alarms will sometimes go off if the windows are open. Small price to pay for the sensual trade winds that will gently caress you.    Every staff person was lovely, friendly, and helpful. For instance, the room only had green tea, so I asked for black. They apologized and immediately delivered lots of Lipton tea bags (and apologized that Lipton was the only black tea available, Lipton is fine). I also asked for beach towels and they immediately brought 3 big towels (we only needed two). Then I asked a cleaning team if they only cleaned once for a two night stay and they both said yes, but they immediately said, do you need service and offered to clean our room there and then—wow! We didn’t need service, but nice to know that it’s there if needed.    The room service for breakfast both mornings was fast and the food tasty (with the exception of the side order of fried rice, which was bland, cold and dry—avoid this one item). Every other item was ono!    A very minor negative was at check-in where the receptionist spent about 5 minutes explaining the resort fee. I know some people are upset by this fee, but there are those of us (aka me) who would prefer to bypass the explanation. Also the on-site popular Japanese restaurant is not affiliated with the hotel, so no preferential treatment for reservations.    We would definitely stay here again. The minor negatives were so minor. The positives were extremely positive. I’d would also always splurge for the suite, now that I know the windows all open. Loved our stay! Thank you Prince!",Aug 2021,July 2021,Traveled as a couple,If you’re willing to splurge—get the suite.,
803171982,50,Great Experience Beginning to End!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Prince Waikiki! The staff was kind & helpful from the moment we arrived. The room was beautiful and the view is unbeatable. Our 5 year old loved the deck pool and it was especially fun to hang out there in the mornings when it wasn't busy at all.    We would have loved a bit of housekeeping, but since our stay was only 3 nights, that wasn't standard. And the restaurant food is ok, but not remarkable - like the rest of the hotel.

It included a lovely breakfast in their outdoor club area, light lunch (sandwiches and amazing soup), soft drinks, juices, coffee (and I believe wine but I don’t drink) and amazing high quality dinners (we had prime rib one night, pork pancit another, and crab rolls another night). It is actually a meal plan which helped a lot during covid times with long waits for food and no reservations. Would definitely come back to this hotel.    Could do a better job with enforcing mask wearing - many people in elevators and lobbies not doing so. But overall - felt safe and clean.

I'm only giving this hotel 4 stars because the room was very dusty in certain places upon check in and after cleaning services around the wooden/metal frames in the room such as the bed frame and lighting in the bathroom which was hard not to see.

800603991,50,"Full, but didn’t feel it. A lovely hotel.","I am struggling to find the words that will accurately communicate how much we enjoyed the Prince Waikiki. We stayed in one of the suites that had a large living space overlooking Ala Wai Harbor and a separate bedroom and large bathroom. Every time we walked into the room, we were greeted with a gorgeous view that took our breath away.  The room was very clean and well furnished with comfortable beds, sofas, loungers, and dining chairs. The A/C was a little loud in the living room, but the separate bedroom A/C was very quiet. The powered window shades and blackout screens were wonderful and very helpful.  We normally don’t use hotel pools when in Hawaii, but the Prince pools, deck, and its views are so nice, we had a hard time wanting to go to the beach.  We enjoyed the Honolulu Coffee counter in the lobby and ate dinners at 100 Sails and KatsuMidori. They were pricey, but we enjoyed them very much. We also enjoyed the McD’s across the street (fried apple pie!).  The distance from the rest of Waikiki beaches and hotels is a bummer, but the isolation when those areas are super busy is also very pleasant.

800582205,50,Best Experience at a Hotel in years!,"I researched hotels in Waikiki for weeks before deciding to book the Prince. Honestly, I didn't expect much after all that has happened in the travel industry over the past year, but we were blown away by this hotel! The hotel itself is immaculately clean, from the driveway, to the lobby, to the pool and the rooms. You will not find a speck of dirt or trash. I cannot remember the last time I could say that, and I spend about 100 nights a year in hotels all over the world for work!!    The views from the rooms are really nothing short of spectacular!! The windows actually OPEN, so you can let the Hawaiian breeze into the room, which is pretty rare (especially high up).    It was very quiet and relaxing here, well separated from the chaos of Waikiki beach, although, it's only a very short walk to all the beaches and craziness if that's your thing.    The pool area was really nice and not overrun with people. You could easily have a lounge chair without having to get down there at 7am to reserve it early.    The staff was really amazing as well!! From the check in staff, to the housekeepers, concierge, and bellmen, just incredibly friendly and helpful. We both commented how they were so friendly, but not in a fake way, but really sincerely nice people. It is so rare to find this and we were so impressed by their professionalism and good spirit.    I can't say enough good things about this property! There were so many other options in Waikiki, but I am SO HAPPY that I chose Prince. I would stay here again and again and again every time we end up on Oahu. You will not regret booking with them, I only wish it had been for another 5 days!!!    Thanks so much for an unforgettable vacation!",Jul 2021,July 2021,,"Higher floors are better, but every room has an ocean view here!","Portland, Oregon"
800574297,40,Solid 4-Star Hotel,"The Prince is billed on some websites at a five-star hotel. It is not a five star hotel. But it is a solid four-star hotel. The people at the front desk and guest services could not be nicer. They are all about service and that is probably five stars. However, housekeeping gets two stars. We were told in advance that they only came every three days due to Covid, which we were expecting. But when they come every three days it seems they are instructed to vacuum and clean the bathroom and change the bed linens and that’s it. We had one clean fork in a plastic wrap and one other item on a table where my son would eat. They did not move those two items to clean the table and the same crumbs were there after cleaning. It seems they are instructed not to clean any flat surfaces in the room. Also, garbage tends to collect in the room and people tend to dump their garbage by the elevator which can become quite unseemly. The rooms are nothing special except for two things. First there is a larger than normal bathroom with a Japanese toilet if that is something appealing to you. Second, the view over the harbor and into the ocean is really beautiful. But it doesn’t turn a standard hotel into five stars from the view only. Also, we originally were placed on the 11th floor over the pool on the fifth floor. The noise from street noise and the pool were so overwhelming we paid extra to move to a higher floor. On the higher floor 27, we could no longer hear the noise . The Prince does have room service right now which many hotels in Oahu do not. The food is quite good but the menu is limited. The Prince charges a daily resort fee but there is no resort. It is at the end of Waikiki with roads on all four sides. There is a pool on the fifth floor and apparently a spa in the building. But there is no resort or resort grounds. If we return to Oahu, we would definitely stay here again but we would expect to pay four-star hotel prices and need to be on a high floor.",Jul 2021,July 2021,Traveled with family,Stay in a high floor and pay 4-star hotel prices,

Room service entrees averaged 35 to $40 with service fees attached in addition. Even though we spent around 400 a night, we weren't given access to the VIP lounge.

797552634,40,It was ok. Not worth the money,"We booked this hotel because my husband had business in Hawaii and needed a hotel close to the airport. It’s a nice hotel, big, and does have a nice view of the marina. One of the nights we were there, we wanted to eat at the restaurant Katsumidori Sushi Tokyo that’s in the hotel. They were nice enough to seat us (2 of us) without a reservation, however we were told we needed to be out by a certain time. The coffee shop in the lobby has delicious coffee and some quick grab and go breakfast. It almost reminded me of Starbucks. The bar outside by the pool was convenient. There was no holding back on the alcohol … that’s for sure!!!! Yum! We sat by the infinity pool which made for nice pictures however, the water was filthy… things were floating in it which I didn’t even want to question. The carpet inside the hallways looked like they weren’t vacuumed in days, and to be honest our bathroom looked like the housekeeping just did a quick run through on everything. Sink was a bit dirty, and everything had spots on it (the chrome faucets, etc). The bed was comfortable. All in all, for the price of the room, it’s just an ok place.

796870682,50,We LOVED it Here!,"I debated for a LONG time where to stay on hour honeymoon/anniversary trip. I am so glad that I choose Prince Waikiki.From the moment we got there, everyone was so friendly! The room was nice and modern and very comfortable! We also loved the spectacular ocean view.    The hotel is generally quiet, which allowed us to really relax. The hotel is located near the Ala Moana Center. This center has TONS of shops and places to eat. The Beach Park has ample spots to lay out and is Way less crowded then the beaches further down in Waikiki. Each place is maybe a 10 minute walk from the hotel.    We rented a cabana and enjoyed a wonderful day at the pool. The pool staff was very helpful and attentive. Cabana tip: see if you can get cabana 3. It has a shade covering. Do you need a cabana? No, but it was really nice to have a reserved space to spread out. Prince has a jacuzzi, pool and infinity pool. All were awesome. There is room for you when ever you want to visit the pool. It is not over crowded. However, we did notice that more people came down to the pool between 4-5.    Prince does have some specials you can take advantage of for activities. Try to book and use these discounts before you come. If you are reading this you probably should be booking your activities right now. Many things are already booked a month out.    In regards to food- we had breakfast included in our stay at 100 sails. The staff here was friendly and the food came out quick. We were offered the American breakfast. It was traditional eggs, bread or hash browns and a meat of your choice (ham, bacon or sausage). We enjoyed it.    We ordered room service. The menu is limited but good. Many locals told us to eat at the Indulge buffet at 100 sails. I believe it's Thurs- Sunday. Book early. It was already booked up before we even visited the hotel.    If you are worried about being far away from the ""action"" don't be. You can take the trolley or walk down to the heart of Waikiki. This took us about 20-25 minutes. Not a bad walk at all.    Overall, I think you will enjoy your stay here. Especially if you want to relax and be away from the Vegas like atmosphere that is downtown Waikiki.",Jul 2021,July 2021,,,

My wife and I hadn’t traveled together since our pre-Covid wedding. Upon hearing this, the front desk staff had a bottle of wine and a lovely card sent to our room on the first night to help us celebrate.

There is an infinity pool that overlooks the ocean and is restricted to adults only as well as a family friendly pool a few steps away. The hot tub was often crowded with kids during our stay so we never got a chance to enjoy it. The best part about the pools, though?

She couldn’t rebook for us. But she said please ask manager. So we called manager and complained, she said sorry and we can rebook ocean front suite. She prepared that room as soon as for us. So we were relieved by her service quickly. Thank you.    Ocean front suite was good. I like that. But little small considering suite room. And it was disappointed what the electric curtain was broken that’s why we couldn’t see beautiful view from bedroom. (Added photos)    Cons:  Mistake our booking.  Electric curtain was broken.    Pros:  Manager is good and quickly service.  Ocean front suite room is little small but comfortable. Ocean view is beautiful.

794095064,50,My Stay at Hawaii Prince Hotel in Waikiki,"My stay began with the quick, friendly, professional and personal service by the valet and bellman. The front desk was courteous and politely answered all of my questions without trying to rush me through the check in procedure.  Housekeeping was every third day and that was okay accept I ended up emptying my own trash can everyday. Since housekeeping was not done daily, I didn't know if I could call them to come and empty my trash can. Every morning on my way to breakfast, I dropped off my trash can liner into the first floor trash receptacle by the elevators.  The staff at the hotel restaurant 100 Sails, really made my stay great. They worked as a team, smoothly, they were polite and always made me feel like a king.... All questions were answered with much details so I knew exactly what i was ordering. They frequently came by to check how I was doing.  Being able to txt the hotel front desk, was so very convenient. The swimming pool and jacuzzi was perfect. If there was a problem with the jacuzzi, the staff there were quick to resolve the matter. The wonderful staff around the pool, in the restaurant, as well as housekeeping were always the first to greet me as I neared.  Also, a special shoutout to the ones who did my laundry..

There needs to be some sort of soft or dimming system, particularly in the bathroom.All common areas were supe clean. Some people entered elevators not wearing face coverings, which irked me because the hotel boasts of following strict protocols.

The view from the room over the harbor was so relaxing.....but.....the people who work here have no hospitality. The front desk is particularly bad - a woman who has a name that is a month of the year( that's all I'll say) was super rube when we checked in , and through out our stay. We called down and asked to have our calls held, then 15 minutes later a man called to say he couldn't hold our calls - huh? We just wanted to get some sleep - but he kept talking wanting to explain about some papers we would have to sign to have out calls help. It was like an episode of Sienfield. We had a $100 credit to use st the restaurants, but when we wanted to use it at the sushi restaurant we were told it was excluded. Why? When we got sushi for take our, and went to the pool to watch sunset and eat the folks at the pool said we couldn't because the sushi restaurant is separate from them. It felt that at evey turn when we tried to relax and have a good time, somewhere was there to say ""No!"" The last day of we got back and had been shopping, so we asked the guys at the valet if someone could come grab our beach towels becuase our hands were full....he said ""we can take your bags to your room so you can return the towels"". Really? Wheres the hospitality? It just felt that they didn't work as a team and really didn't want us there. Jared the manager tried to help and listened and was shocked at what was happening, but he can only do so much. He cant be everywhere - and where he's not, they are just rude.

Also, we asked basic questions and were repeatedly given bad advice. For instance, we asked about getting a cab back after the Diamond Head hike.

793561630,50,Pleasant stay,"Hawaii hotels are often outdated, but Prince Waikiki was a nice balance of a more contemporary and minimalistic style, while still maintaining the classic upscale look and feel of what you’d expect from a 4-star hotel.    We enjoyed the large windows that overlooked the ocean and marina in the Diamond Tower. If you get a room in the center of the building, you get the best view as there’s no privacy wall.    We paid extra for the club lounge access, and enjoyed the Japanese bento box breakfasts, though the rest of the food/snack offerings weren’t anything special.    Hotel service was good, but no one stood out like Richard Park at the front desk concierge. Richard went above and beyond for us on several occasions, and his dedication to customer service satisfaction should be used as an example to the rest of the staff. When we left a clothing item behind in the room, we called to have it sent back to us, but a month and a half plus several back and forth phone calls later between management and housekeeping, our forgotten item had not even been mailed yet even though we were told it would get handled promptly. Finally, it only took one conversation with Richard to have our belongings packaged and shipped, free of charge, and merely an hour after speaking with him!! So thank you Richard! I was going to leave a negative review due to the frustration of this situation, but Richard rectified the incident and absolved any dissatisfaction. He offers 5-star level service.

792984864,50,Wonderful place to stay with kids,"We booked the ocean front two bedroom two bath suite for our stay. My husband and I brought 2 of our 3 kids (the oldest is an adult and was working). It was a great place to head back to after a long day of touring, snorkeling and other activities. We had breakfast daily in our room and it was nice to have this leisurely time together for a meal before we started our day. The bed was comfortable and as a Prince Preferred guest, we had discounted valet, that we used frequently, and also received water bottles every day. The bathrooms were nice and roomy, each equipped with a Toto washlet/bidet. The showers had good water pressure and the tub was separate from the shower. There's a convenient drying line in the bathroom as well, to help us dry our beach towels and bathing suits every day. There is a nice couch to watch TV in the family room, although it could be comfier (hard to compare to what we have at home, since we have a reclining leather sofa) but the views were amazing. It was mesmerizing to catch the sun set and watch the sailboats. There was a perfect little area for dining. The location is also very convenient to the Ala Moana mall where there were nice full service restaurants (about a 5-7 minute drive away), as well as walking distance (about a 13 minute walk, based on our 10 year old's pace) to Ala Moana beach park. Ala Moana Beach is nice because it's not crowded and the waters are calm. Very easy to set up a beach blanket and play with the family, unlike the crazy at Waikiki. The only downside is the sand is very rocky, so definitely would wear water shoes.    The only other suggestion for the hotel is probably more substantial (firm) pillows. I realize most people like soft pillows and my husband and I have a sleep number bed and pillows, so again, hard to compare at home. Both hubby and I have existing neck/shoulder problems so it was hard to get comfortable.    Otherwise though, this was a wonderful few days in Oahu and the stay here just completed our vacation.

I never saw such a bad setup before.  - Quite far from where the action is in Waikiki. If you want to be in Waikiki, you likely want to be closer in to the main beach and the restaurants /shopping. Otherwise, you likely want to be as far away as possible from Waikiki :) We worked around it with the Biki bikeshare.

Upon our arrival, we had a warm Aloha greeting from the kindly grandpa Prince of Waikiki, himself. The overall level of care and attention to our needs from the entire PW staff (seriously, too many names to mention) was consistently friendly courteous and efficient throughout our stay. The concierge, Richard, suggested and reserved an excellent Oahu island tour activity for us. (Selection and availability for activities seem to fill up quickly; so my rcommendation is to make your arrangements as soon possible, if not ahead of time)  We had a premium double bed ocean view room that overlooked the marina, which was both spacious and comfortable enough. I must admit, I was initially disappointed that the hotel does not have direct access to the beach. However, the beach and a park were only a short walk away. The hotel's proximity to the Ala Moana mall, restaurants, and shopping was a real BONUS!  We are already looking forward to our next visit.

The line at check-in was long, but it went quickly and the staff was attentive, letting us know what we would need in order to help check-in go smoothly. The woman at reception was very friendly and helpful as we had many questions. She even helped arrange reservations for us at the restaurant in the hotel which we appreciated.    When we got to our room, the bellhop showed us how to use some of the electronics and made sure we were squared away before leaving. The view was phenomenal and the room was nice and spacious, and most importantly, clean. It was modern and exceeded our expectations. We wanted to stay longer after realizing what a great hotel we were staying in but it was fully booked.    The hotel was in the perfect area for my family and me. It was a short walk to the Waikiki main area but still had a beautiful view of the bay and the ocean. So we were close enough to the action without being in a crowded, noisy area which we valued. The coffee shop in the lobby was appreciated as well. And the elevators were super fast, which sounds like a strange thing to mention but when your room is on the 29th floor, it is appreciated :) I cannot say enough about our wonderful experience. We will most definitely return for future visits!",Jun 2021,June 2021,,,"Tokyo, Japan"

Kay at the front desk area was superb in assisting us and all guests with great information and superior customer service. The hotel pool was wonderful and not crowded, which was very pleasant. The coffee area in the lobby was a lifesaver for the mornings when we needed a quick bite before our daily tours. Our room had a marina/ocean view which was heaven to wake up to each day.    We weren't prepared for the post-Covid shutdown effect on restaurants and the necessity of having reservations for all meals to avoid long waits or no restaurant availability.

The room was very clean but house keeping only comes once every 3 days to clean your room, take your garbage and give you towels, so people people put their garbage outside their rooms. I had to call them to pick up our neighbor's trash because it was outside their dooor for 2 days. The doormen were great.

Overlooking the marina and ocean, but a short walk away from the Waikiki beach hotels and crowds, it was the perfect choice for us. The hotel and rooms were elegant, the staff was super friendly and the restaurant and bar was superb! We never used the pools or fitness center, but they looked awesome and relaxing (zero tourist crowd vibes, and few families with small kids). The fact that it doesn't really cater to families with small kids (no beach) was also a big plus for us, and the rooms were quiet and comfortable. Close walking to Ala Moana Shopping Center and Waikiki beach, but far enough away to not be impacted by the hoards.

Our room was very spacious and we were pleasantly surprised that the large windows opened fully to let in fresh air (when the windows are open, your a/c will automatically turn off). The check in process was fast and the front desk even sent us some champagne for our anniversary. The hotel has exceptional pools and is within a 5 minute walk to the ala moana shopping center. The only small complaint we have is that on Friday and Saturday, the self parking lot was full and we had to use valet instead (but it was complementary).

788363010,40,A good experience - but little things not quite up to par,"Went down to the hotel after canceling the trip last year due to COVID - suffice to say, had very high expectations for a Prince property after hearing of their reputation in Japan. While the hotel was very nice and the staff were obviously supportive of reopening, the hotel stay did lack some polish on a lot of little things that when added up made for a less than ideal experience.    Drinks - far overpriced compared to some in the area - e.g. specialty well drinks at $15 each, when we visited bars at a couple of nearby properties well drinks were around $10 or less for similar recipes.    Shower - didn't drain very fast for the first half of the week, but once we realized it was getting worse and alerted maintenance it was fixed the same day (so that was excellent).    Room - only one full drawer for storing clothes (with the exception of the drawer which doubles as a room safe) makes for a bit of a challenge when you have 2 people unpacking. Maid service was only being done once every third day, which was fine for e.g. linens and towels, but the in-room coffee service and water bottles which were part of the amenity package were not refreshed daily, and for the former only one days' worth of cream/sugar were left. We had to ask for restocking once, and gave up after that.    Cabana - we did opt to rent a cabana for a day, and that was a good experience - albeit a bit expensive. It was very windy so we couldn't really pull the curtains, and the slatted roof on the cabana meant that we were moving a lot to keep our legs from taking on a griddle appearance in the sun. At the minimum a roof option or sunshade would be nice for those who burn a little easier even with sunscreen.    Coffee bar in lobby - expensive even for Hawaii, and only open limited hours (6am to 12pm). Line was frequently long and service slow. This was not run by the hotel, but contributed.    Restaurant - table service menu adapted from the normal buffet style was good, but limited in its offerings especially for breakfast. There were things on the tasting menu (e.g. loco moco, taro pancakes) that I would have loved to have tried full size on their own, but they weren't offered. For dinner, we found more options on the bar menu, which we had to ask for - dinner menu was quite limited for table service during the week.    All in all, would stay there again - but putting some extra shine on the finer details will make it a much better experience for the repeat visit.",May 2021,May 2021,,,
788306194,50,Wonderful!,"Prince Waikiki was amazing! The service was great. We did add the club access for the week and it’s definitely worth it, Janae and Kori (hopefully spelled correctly) were absolutely wonderful. Tip: add the club access when booking as it has limited availability, the couple we took was told they could add this feature on arrival and then was told at check in they were sold out due to limited availability, they were not very happy about that. The young bartender male on the 5th floor wasn’t very nice, we didn’t catch his name but everyone on the property was great. Thank you George for always opening the door for us on arrival and giving us tips around the island. Also use you concierge they are wonderful at assisting with bookings.

The views are breathtaking with a guaranteed ocean view (without having to pay extra as some hotels do). Besides being beautifully decorated, the rooms are spacious, inviting with super comfy bedding and the staff are both super friendly and very accommodating. I needed a late checkout since I was traveling with my 76 yr old mom and Loni made it happen which was a great relief to my mom who usually needs to rest & nap throughout the day and especially before getting on a long flight. We both were extremely grateful!    This is a beautiful gem of a hotel away from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki beach set along the harbor.

787989106,50,Best Hotel Ever,"Somewhere around 3am, we had returned to the hotel after just being married. We had a lot of things to take to our room and in the midst of it all, dropped cash in the lobby, almost $2000 to be exact. We didn't realize it was missing until late the next day. We tossed our room, called our friends, and no one knew where it was. My husband and I were very sad and told ourselves we would just have to take the loss. We were leaving the hotel to go to lunch and he decided we should try asking the front desk, just in case. We knew it was a long shot, but asked anyway. The front desk said she would check with the manager on duty if anyone may have turned in an envelope. The manager came out to say there was a notation in their log that an in-house bride dropped an envelope with cash. We verified the amount and he graciously returned it to us.    We are so appreciative of the honesty, warmth, and compassion the Prince has shown us for our wedding weekend / honeymoon. We couldn't have picked a better hotel to stay at.

787011868,50,Sweet Serenity by the Sea,"Choosing this beautiful hotel was the best choice for us, arriving in Hawaii in April 2021 for my birthday and to spend time with some local friends. The location was perfect for us, as it was on the marina and a view of the ocean, beach and lagoon. It wasn't as hectic as the main drag of Waikiki. We would prefer an Adult only resort, but lucky for us, there weren't too many children, but our preference is zero. There's a regular pool and an infinity pool and it seemed for the most part, the kids weren't in there when we were. We had a club level room on the 33rd floor ( of 33 ) on the end. The view was breathtaking and exciting, something to see at all times. The fitness center was ok, they request you to wear a mask while in there ) there was one elliptical, two treadmills ( one was out of order ) and a bike for cardio. several machines quite close together and a rack of weights, with a view of the pool and marina. Unfortunately, the club level wasn't at full amenity. You had to have your temperature checked every time you entered. You weren't permitted to get any of the food yourself, and they didn't have full selections. The staff was most kind about it all and it's not their fault. Just an upgrade that may not be worth it during these times. It seemed we were the only guests on our floor, so it was quiet which was nice. Our renovated rooms even had a bidet in the bathroom. The shower is pretty tight, we are 5'9"" and 6'3"" and the square shower doesn't have much room. There was only housekeeping every 3 days, but you could call for towels or anything else you may need. Since the hotel wasn't full, they were pretty quick. Prior to arriving in Hawaii, at this time, it's best to make dinner reservations in advance which for the most part, we did. There's a sushi restaurant inside the building ( not run by the hotel ) and we couldn't get a reservation our whole stay, yet the bellman raved about it... called ( Katsumidori sushi Tokyo ). Howard at the pool, was the best server ever, and extremely attentive. When you rent a cabana, try to be specific of the location of it, prior to renting it. It seems they need to get a better organizational grip on that. There's an ABC store, walking distance to the hotel from the 'back' entrance. Overall this was a very good location and stay for us with very friendly staff. Aloha!",Apr 2021,April 2021,,,"Scottsdale, Arizona"

The Toto toilet with bidet is a nice feature but being disabled the toilet was too low for me.

So my wife and I arrived at Prince Waikiki Resort on 3.18.2021 and wet met with smiles by the valet group, they proceeded to show us to the front receptionist. We were greeted by Mei and my wife proceeded to check us in. She asked for both of our ID’s and a credit card. (All ID’s and Credit Cards share the same last name). While checking us in Mei proceeded to tell us that the Airport called and informed them that I was to quarantine while staying on there property. We already knew this going into check in at the hotel because there was some system issues with my portal and test results that needed time to clear up! I was totally fine with that because I knew that was not the extent of our trip.    So Mei proceeds to go over the quarantine rules of Prince Waikiki with me and my wife. Check in is complete and she hands us our ID’s and credit cards back (All ID’s and Credit Cards share the same last name). She instructs us where to park and hands our room keys. We the leave the counter with the understanding that I can not leave the room while under quarantine but my wife can come and go as she please.

So I proceed back to the car to gather those belongings and get back to our room and our room key doesn’t work. So I proceed downstairs back to the lobby to the customer service rep Mei who helped us and begin to tell her that our key doesn’t work.    Mei rudely tells me that “your under quarantine and I will call the cops on you”    I’m trying to explain to her that we just checked in and our key doesn’t work.    Mei rudely responds “I told you and your girlfriend the rules”    Now at this point I’m visually upset because she insulted by wife and this is the same customer service rep who checked us in.    Here comes the Director of Operations because there is clearly a scene in his lobby. He approaches me and as I’m trying to explain the situation he is escorting me up to my room and just simply reassuring me that he will address the situation and that he would bring my wife a new room key shortly (which never happened).    Now at this point I’m livid in the room because of the level of disrespect I’ve just witnessed over a room key that one seemed to listen.    So overnight I clear quarantine and we go about our day of adventures! We get back to the hotel 4pm and can’t get into our room. So to not have a repeat of the day before my wife goes down to get a new key!    Come to find out, the Director of Operations locked us out of our room and called the cops because he believed I broke quarantine. He believed I broke quarantine because I was not available to answer the hotel phone in my room. So instead of calling me or my wife on our cellphone to figure this situation out he calls the cops instead.    So now we’re standing outside of our hotel room speaking with 4 Honolulu officers explaining the situation at hand! After an hour of explanation the officers let’s us back in our room because they deemed us of NO wrongdoings!    At this point the Director of Operations never apologized but was present in that same hallway the officers were in speaking with us listening to every word!    Thank you for the Manager by name of Claire for stepping up and exemplify what customer service is! Claire made sure from that moment in the hallway until check out we were good to go. She gave us additional resources to clear up the miscommunication between the Hawaii portal.    I’m a 6’3 black male, just hate that the cops had to be threatened to be called on me then turn around and actually call them on me when this could’ve been resolved internally!    Again Thank You Claire for the bottle of Champagne and the high floor was not seeking that but only seeking a change in culture!    5 Stars for Claire!",Mar 2021,March 2021,Traveled as a couple,,"Atlanta, Georgia"
785416948,50,Great location in Waikiki,"This is a good hotel located on the edge of Waikiki. It's good if you plan to drive around the island because it's easy to get in and out of and parking is included in the resort fees. It is also a short walk to the center of Waikiki and downtown Honolulu. The coffee shop downstairs is great for breakfast, however it is not open in the afternoon.  My only complaint is that the front desk staff wasn't able to answer by questions regarding activities on the island. Fortunately I was able to find everything online.",Mar 2021,March 2021,,,"Miami, Florida"
785220955,50,Perfect view always,I highly recommend! I’ve stayed at quite a few places and this is a winner. Always a peaceful view and great service. Very attentive staff! It will be nice when more shops and restaurants open up again (post COVID).,Mar 2021,March 2021,,,"Tracy, California"
785169980,50,Great Establishment,"First of all, this was my first trip to Oahu. I'm not sure what is standard for pricing and amenities. This is a very beautiful and maintained establishment. I'm not sure what changes were all made for COVID, but it did not really seem to impact my stay. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. The prices were high and a sticker shock, but I quickly realized it was because of the Waikiki area. The beds were extremely comfortable and the view from the ocean view room was nice. The view from the onsite restaurant was nice also, but would have been better without the build up of dirt and spots. The food was very good, but I would have liked to see a bit more variability and options.    The only complaint I had was that I had to call for a trash pick up outside of my room. They informed me at the beginning that due to COVID, housekeeping was only cleaning rooms every third day. However, I would assume (and hope) that the rest of the establishment was still being cleaned on a daily basis. I left my full trash cans outside of my room in hopes that it would be emptied during a daily cleaning of the establishment.    Otherwise, the pool was nice, the shower pressure excellent, and the added bidet feature was amusing. The room was well temperature controlled and the electric curtains and ability to open a window were a nice feature. Would definitely recommend this establishment.",Mar 2021,March 2021,,,"Sugar Land, Texas"
785158432,50,"Great room, great people, great location","First, I want to thank the Prince Waikiki for upgrading us to a suite. it was a wonderful surprise for my wife's birthday. Second, the staff was always friendly and attentive to our needs. Third, do yourself a favor and add the Club level access. I only expected a continental breakfast with beer and wine, but the full breakfast and dinner were well worth the price. Lunch was available also, but we were touring...  We are not beach people, so the location away from the sand was fine with us. I enjoyed watching the boat comes and go in the ""Gillian's Island Marina"". if the beach is your thing, it is a very short walk to the west end of Waikiki beach.    There is no doubt that if and when we return to Oahu, we will be staying at the Prince Waikiki",Mar 2021,March 2021,,,"Sacramento, California"
785055798,50,Awesome Spring Break Getaway,"We always love staying at the Prince Waikiki when we pop over from a neighbor island for a little city-life action. What was planned as a romantic weekend getaway for my husband and me turned into a family vacation after our teenage daughter joined the trip last minute. Upon arriving at the hotel and wanting to add a room, we learned that the hotel was sold out. Fortunately, Teppei at the Front Desk was so helpful and professional. He was able to offer us a few different options and showed us Matterports of those room options. We ended up staying in top floor suite with incredible ocean views! If you're looking for a place to stay in Waikiki, I can't recommend the Prince Waikiki enough. It's conveniently placed between Kalakaua Avenue (Waikiki's ""Main Street"") and Ala Moana Mall. Both are within a short walking distance either through parks or oceanfront strolls. You're close, but not in the middle of either, which is good, because the energy of both can be a lot and it's nice to dip out. Plus, the views from the Prince Waikiki are incredible! I LOVE looking horizon line past the sailing ship masts (very romantic) from the room, and enjoy looking outward up towards the mountains (center of the island) over Ala Wai Canal as we ride up the elevators. Great for solo-travel, couples, trips with girlfriends, or with the entire family, the Prince Waikiki is where we always enjoy staying .",Mar 2021,March 2021,,,

Reserved an ocean view room on a lower floor and found that it was much more convenient for this stay around. Room was clean, comfortable and spacious. Thank you to the reservations team for fulfilling all our requests upon arrival. I wanted to give an extra Mahalo to Geldey in the maintenance dept for going above and beyond and retrieving my sun hat that flew over the pool deck and over the railing. He was super exceptional!!! The pool attendants (2 ladies) that were usually working while we were at the pool were always attentive and friendly. Keep up the great service. Thanks for the hospitality. Will definitely stay again!",Mar 2021,March 2021,,,

784169852,50,A hotel fit for a prince and princess,"My wife and I had a marvelous nine days at the Prince Waikiki on the 31st floor, where our room overlooked the yacht harbor.  The room was clean, quiet, with a terrific view of tropical sunsets.  The bathroom was outstanding with a separate tub, an enclosed toilet and shower, with plenty of warm water.  Our closet came outfitted with two robes and an ironing board.  There were two pools, one an infinity pool which overlooked the ocean and the yachts while the larger pool lay between the sun bathing area and the bar.  Within a few minutes of our first arrival, the pool staff knew our names and greeted us by name from then on.  Parking in their expansive garage was easy, though it took us awhile to master the room key on the parking kiosk where the remote parking attendant shortly knew us by name as well.  All in all I recommend the Prince Waikiki without a pause.  The staff, from those at the front door, to reception, to the maids and gardner's are outgoing, friendly and attentive to your needs.  They made our experience, despite the strictures due to Covid, masks, and social distancing, a delight.  Feel down? Purchase gourmet cookies and a ceramic sea turtle at the lobby gift shop.  We weren't feeling blue, but we felt better after a visit to the shop.  So, going stir crazy and tired of tanning by the pool?  Walk ten minutes to the Ala Moana Center and find a plethora of shops from Le Sportsac to Macy's and restaurants galore.  Take in some music at The Blue Note, or visit Pearl Harbor.  Live a little, this is Prince Waikiki in Honolulu, one terrific place to stay with a superb sushi bar just off the lobby.  We'll be back, our lei's were carried inshore by the tide of good cheer we experienced.",Mar 2021,March 2021,,,
784036955,20,Great hotel but pool area is a scam,We stayed at the Prince Waikiki in March 2021 and had a lovely time for the most part. Staff were friendly and location was excellent. Only thing that put us off was the fact that you have to pay for any shade at the outdoor pool (apparently it’s too windy for umbrellas and the cabanas were $120+). Totally ridiculous for a high end hotel and will not be coming back for this reason.,Mar 2021,March 2021,Traveled as a couple,,"New York City, New York"
783976149,50,Absolutely Wonderful,"The hotel staff are very friendly. The room is clean, with 2 double beds and an ocean view. The bathroom is clean. I especially like that the toilet is in a separate little room with frosted glass for privacy and a bidet toilet with heated seats. The shower is also separate from the tub with frosted glass for privacy. They provide shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and bars of soap. The pool is clean and they provide towels and there is a bar for those who drink. The beds are comfortable and clean. The elevators are see through so we can see the scenery as we go up and down. There is a restaurant, 2 gift shops and a coffee cafe. We were given 2 bottles of water every day. Shopping is a walk away. There is a 24 hour safety gap before they rent the room to someone else. I think that covers everything.",Mar 2021,March 2021,,,
783973642,40,On the Water overlooking the Marina,"Our room was overlooking the Marina and river where they were doing dragonboat races. Rooms are all a great size and a Crib was available for our little one as well. The weather was not the best, but the hot tub and pool had insanely nice views as the rain and clouds broke. The only downside is you have a really long walk or short drive to get down to Waikiki Beach. We had a car rented and drove down repeatedly. Outside of the inconvenience of the short drive and parking, the hotel itself was quite good. If you want some place that is a little less chaotic than the main drag, but close enough to visit this place is definitely high end.",Mar 2021,April 2020,,,"Georgetown, Canada"

783679367,40,Great value prices from Costco Travel,"Found Costco deal for <$1500 a week on car rental + room at the newly-renovated Prince Waikiki (parking & water included). The room & facilities are nice but wish they got rid of the carpet flooring & add soft-close on the doors (it will slam loudly if you let it close on their own). I was definitely sold after looking at the gorgeous pictures of their infinity pool and I didn't mind on their further proximity to Waikiki because we like going to different places everyday so got car rental included in our costco package (cheapest ever). They're supposed to have free shuttle to take you to Waikiki Beach, Hawaii Prince Golf Club & Ala Moana Center, the World’s Largest Open-Air Shopping Mall (with daily 1pm free hula show). Unfortunately it's unavailable during the pandemic. But you can walk to the beach behind Hilton Hawaiian Village in just 5 minutes and the hotel actually provides you with all the beach necessity (chairs, mats, Kickboard, swim tube, umbrella, etc). Housekeeping is also done only every 4 days during pandemic (we check in on Wednesday so next cleaning is on Saturday). Housekeeping could have done slightly better job especially during covid. Found hair here and there (even pets hair on chairs padding), also lots of dusty surfaces. We bumped into housekeeper and it bothers me that she's not wearing gloves. Hope she would sanitize her hands between rooms. For extra protection, we used lysol spray again to sanitize everything. I would definitely not mind staying here again for our future trip but would stay away from room near elevator (xx14) because you can hear the mechanical of the elevator moving loudly & all day long.",Feb 2021,February 2021,Traveled with family,,"San Jose, California"

Before arriving, I had emailed to ask for a shuttle service from the airport and had casually mentioned that it was our honeymoon...to my surprise, they took note of our special occasion and we had a gift waiting for us. That was just a sneak peak of what was to come...we were at the receiving end of this thoughtful service the whole stay and even saw an episode of Hawaii 5-0 being filmed outside the front lobby. The 100 Sails restaurant at the hotel offers an unbelievable buffet with prime rib and crab legs that is unrivaled and the Honolulu cafe is great for early morning snacks before any excursions.

You can see Diamond Head, Ala Moana Beach, Waikiki Beach and the harbor right in front (they filmed the beginning of Gilligan's Island here) from the comfort of your room. Nothing beats an ocean view and the windows open if you want some fresh air. The staff here is very accommodating and they all are following social distancing protocols. We felt the hotel was very clean and safe. The restaurants were amazing with HH from 100 Sails and fresh sushi from Katsumidori.

783121349,50,NOW I understand all the 5 Star Ratings,"I stayed at the beginning of January to celebrate the New Year and my Birthday. I'm from Washington, DC and this was my very first trip to Hawaii. I purchased one of those detailed guide books from Amazon.com and it listed The Royal Hawaiian, The Four Seasons and The Kahala as the top 3 places to stay in Oahu. I just had to satisfy my curiosity and see what TripAdvisor had to say. So, I stumbled upon Prince Waikiki on this site and I see nothing but 5 star reviews. My curiosity (and FOMO) got the best of me and I booked 3 nights at Prince. Upon arrival, my king room was upgraded to a 1 bedroom, oceanview suite. Which worked out perfectly because I had a separate living area to telework. I was also given a birthday card and a sparkling wine from the hotel staff. The room was very modern, clean, and an amazing view of the boat harbor and downtown. With floor to ceiling windows I was in love every time I entered my room. I had club room access, which I was expecting continental breakfast and snacks throughout the day. No, I actually had 3 filling MEALS everyday-- breakfast, lunch, dinner and optional snacks if I wanted. This went above and beyond any club room experience I've ever had. And all of those things I mentioned above are awesome, but the staff members are what make this place so special. I legit thought I was staying at a Four Seasons resort because everyone knew my name without me telling them. The club lounge hostesses, the valet, the front desk, housekeeping...it was unreal. And I felt so good here, I extended my stay another 5 days. Housekeeping was on point. Having a coffee shop in the lobby was a plus for me during telework days. The valet crew were soo friendly and attentive (and the valet was cheap! only $15/night). One day, I was on my way out for sightseeing and I stopped at the coffee shop for caffeine. Well, I walked out to valet with my latte and the valet men saw me getting coffee and had already pulled my car around so that it would be ready when I came out. Classy as f*ck! I am planning to come back to HI in the next few weeks and I will definitely split my stay here. Thank you!",Feb 2021,January 2021,,,"Washington DC, District of Columbia"

We were celebrating our ""babymoon,"" as in our ""last hurrah"" before our first baby is born. I booked the room about a month in advance and eagerly looked forward to our stay. Upon checking in, we were upgraded to an oceanfront room on the 10th floor. We were so delighted! The room itself had stunning views of the Ala Wai boat harbor and endless ocean views. It was a little close to the pool, so with the windows open it got noisy. We had a king sized bed which was comfortable with pillows that were a little less comfortable. We had robes, slippers, coffee, bottled water, etc. The bathroom was luxurious with a bathtub and shower and toto toilet with temperature and water controls. The tongs for the ice bucket were dirty and caked with food, but we just used our hands to scoop our ice. The ice machine on the 9th floor was hard to find, but I used the house phone to call the front desk and find its exact location. Signage would be helpful. Staff were responsive, quick and professional to all requests. We had in-room dining and it arrived promptly! The food at the pool was incredibly delicious, especially the fish and chips - a must have! We adored the infinity pool and views from the sundeck. The hot tub was managed by a pool hand when it got very busy. I appreciated the pool hand very much who kept an eye out for open lounge chairs for us. The exercise room has lots of machines and is good for a workout. Overall, I would highly recommend staying here. The staff make it a truly incredible experience.

I like that they were able to accommodate a later checkout time. Room was clean, luxurious (as described) and updated, filled with need toiletries, house slippers and even robe. Nice touch.  On property restaurants 100 Sails and Katsumidori highly recommended.  We loved just hanging out at the adult only infinity pool. We rented a private cabana for a day that included 2 cocktails, 4 bottled and a gourmet pizza. Pizza was good and we highly recommend the Mango 5-0 and the Maitais for cocktails.  Loved our overall stay. Always did and no complaints whatsoever! We always recommend Prince Waikiki to visiting out of town family and friends.",Jan 2021,January 2021,,,

780999619,50,5 star service w/a smile,"We had a handful of hotels we were looking at and we ended up choosing this hotel due to it being one of the few hotels that could accommodate our oversized vehicle. We didn't mind paying the valet for it rather than hoping it would fit in any garage and wanted to make sure we could park it safely on property. There are many hotels who don't offer valet right now so we were happy to have this service. Since we hadn't stayed here before we only booked one day to make sure we really like it. Naomi in Reservations was super helpful in being patient with me.    Day of check in we arrived and the valet and bell guys were just so warm and friendly. They were quick to help and with a smile. I wish  I got all their names. I was only able to snatch Chad's name who was just so helpful and showed so much aloha to us.    We checked into our room and unfortunately our curtain wasn't retracting properly. Jerry from maintenance was quick to respond and was so courteous and helpful. He fixed it pretty quick and off he went.  Our view from our room was just breathe taking, the amenities we received were over the top, the room was so clean, beautifully decorated, comfortable(literally every chair in the room I could nap on and I did lol), must I go on?    I literally called the Front Desk for everything and every time whether it was Pammie, Ethan or Jin, they were all so warm, sincere and ready to serve me. I felt like royalty. Everything I needed they provided and didn't nickel and dime me. They really know how to provide great service and with a smile(you can literally see it just by the tone of their voices lol)!!    So, as you can imagine after our 1st night being over the top amazing we not only extended our stay but we upgraded our room to a 2 bedroom suite and let me tell you....this place was jaw dropping 5 star views, quality, value, you name it!!! We were so impressed and loved this place so much we are going back again next week lol    This is our favorite hotel now and it'll be hard for us to choose another hotel when in Waikiki. If you want quality, value, cleanliness, 5 star service, great location, etc. look no further this is your place. You literally do not have to go anywhere and our 6 kids were just fine w/the 3 pools they offered. They weren't begging to go to the beach.    The restaurants were top notch, 5 star even down to the cocktails you can order around sunset time at the pool. We enjoyed food from the pool bar as well as 100 Sails.",Jan 2021,December 2020,,,"Kahuku, Hawaii"

The hotel itself is very enjoyable with nice rooms with a great view, two restaurants in the hotel for lazy day, as well an infinity pool. The rooms are well decorated and spacious.

780372122,50,Excellent service and amenities!,"This is our first visit to Oahu and the Prince Waikiki and we didn’t know what to expect with COVID and all. I have to say that the hotel service was exceptional in every way. Restaurant service, front desk, room service, pool attendant and especially at the club lounge (we upgraded to a club floor lounge) - everyone was exceptionally friendly and responsive. It was impressive. No exceptions.    We were told that we would receive housekeeping services every third day and we did. The front desk was kind enough to arrange housekeeping both days during our visit to accommodate our schedule. We really appreciated the tea kettle, Keurig and mini-fridge in the room, as well as the powered blackout window shades. Hotel was quiet and clean. I encountered staff cleaning common areas multiple times, including the elevator. The pool seemed small but getting a chair wasn’t a problem as the hotel wasn’t full due to COVID. There is no way to reserve a chair unless you pay for the poolside cabanas.    Food at the club lounge was somewhat limited. It was good, not great. Club rooms are generously sized. The in-room safe was disappointing, but that’s a nit. The location served us well as we were within walking distance of shopping, restaurants, and a car rental agency. All in all, we were pleased with our stay at the Prince Waikiki.",Jan 2021,December 2020,,Club rooms have added amenities and are on the top floor with views of the harbor and ocean.,"Park City, UT"
780352402,50,BEST hotel in Honolulu,"Prince Waikiki was EXCELLENT!! Our family stayed a week and enjoyed everyday. All of the staff were very friendly, the rooms were clean, and the hotel was completed renovated in 2017 so everything looks new. The pool deck was very nice especially with the infinity pool overlooking the harbor & ocean. Just a 5 minute walk to two beaches and Ala Moana Mall. Can't say enough great things about this place. We had originally booked at the Hilton Hawaiian Village but left after the first night due to bedbugs & no A/C.",Jan 2021,December 2020,,,
780298158,30,Fell short of expectations,"Overall experience relative to cost was below expectations especially given the additional cost for club experience and amenities. Food quality/variety sub par, hotel cleanliness sub par, service ok.    Housekeeping only twice in a 9 day trip, trash left in hallways for days on a club floor, room service trays also left in hallways for days despite requests for pickups, menu selections in primary restaurants and in the guest club were very limited and never changed. Club menu for lunch was always the same finger sandwiches, tuna, egg, ham and cheese; beast, always the same, dinner...I could get the same at zippy’s and it would taste better. The Prince was always known for amazing food...definitely not now. Even during Covid you can pick a few things and do them well. Also, most concerning, flight crews share the elevator banks with guests. I had to wait for five elevators before getting one at a peak period and these crews are just coming off planes, no cleaning in between? That seems like a gap in the procedures. Lastly, some staff retraining is needed. A guest asked if she could work out in the open space, one of male pool bartenders said of course...then added he would be sure to sell tickets so everyone could ‘watch’. Not exactly appropriate...    Room cleaning left a lot to be desired, empty condom box and food wrappers behind the bed. I was on a club floor.    Club amenities were sparse. Never got the two bottles of water in our room a day. My husband did take advantage of the beer on tap but it never rotated so kinda boring. The wine was not a great selection so I skipped it and there was constantly air in the line, not a fan of bubbles in my Chardonnay. I already mentioned the free food selection was repetitive and not very tasty so just didn’t see the value. Lots to work on I think.",Dec 2020,December 2020,,,
780169277,40,Great Hotel But Social Distancing Can Be Improved,"We have been going to the Prince Waikiki every year for a staycation. This year we decided to take advantage of the good kamaaina rates and stay for four days. We love that the rooms are spacious and every room has a great view of the ocean. Having a separate toliet, shower and tub is also a plus. Customer service is always excellent. We were there with our kids 8 &11. When we wanted to go the pool we noticed that it was quite crowded and that social distancing was not being enforced. There should be a limit and reservation system for the use of the pool. One evening they were having a telescope event to see the Christmas star. We were shocked to see so many people in lines and not social distancing. There were way too many people on the pool deck to be considered safe.",Dec 2020,December 2020,,,
780045128,50,Great Stay during Holiday/Covid times,"Stayed at Prince Waikiki a few times before. This is the first time during COVID. Hotel does a great job in creating a safe/clean atmosphere for travelers. Rooms are very nice as usual and love how there are water views. Rooms are on the bigger side compared to other hotels in Waikiki. Bathrooms are probably one of the best. Love the Japanese toilets, reminds me of hotels in Japan.    I think what is different this time around is that we ended up doing alot of take out food. We ate in our rooms but then realized that Prince Waikiki has many areas where we can take our food and eat. Especially on the pool level behind the south tower. So this made eating take out much better.    We also stayed in another resort and they didn't have places where people could just bring outside food and eat in. We checked other hotels as well and not many have this option. So thinking back, what Prince Waikiki offers where guests can eat their take out on tables/chairs on hotel grounds is actually something that is valuable now.    With also the waived resort fee which includes parking... the value of Prince is even better now.  Looking at other hotels, I would have paid for resort fees and parking fees on top of the room rate.    Overall, another great stay, especially during these challenging times.",Dec 2020,December 2020,,,Seattle

779662556,20,Underwhelming birthday staycation,"I booked a 2 night ocean front premier room at the kamaaina rate with late checkout on Sunday which included free self parking and bento breakfast box.  I booked for my birthday weekend Upon arrival the valet was very nice and welcoming and directed us to self parking. The front desk staff wasn’t as personable just to the point. When we got to our room we unpacked and headed to the pool where weren’t greeted by the bartenders. We asked them if this where we order and they just looked at us and continued their work, we asked again and another worker said we needed to check in and then let us know we could order at the bar or poolside whichever we preferred. This was our first time at the pool so we didn’t know what to do or how to order.. Once we got back to the room I showered and noticed there was hairs in the shower I called front desk and they sent housekeeping and sounded a little annoyed and was quick to hang up. Once housekeeping came the cleaned the shower they asked me to inspect it I looked in the shower and there was still hair on the shower wall? I pointed it out and she cleaned and disinfected it again. Saturday morning while making the bed I found black hair on the mattress protector and I have blonde hair. As a 4 star hotel I would expect them to at least have a fully cleaned room and bathroom.I booked this as birthday treat to myself and hasn’t felt special very underwhelmed at this point. Unfortunately just a mediocre first impression after the rave reviews I read I was hoping for more. Sunday we went to get breakfast at 1015 and there was a few families waiting already so we were told the restaurant is full and we could only order food to go which is fine but then we waited over 45 minutes. Sunday we also booked a premium cabana for 280$ and we wanted the one the spa uses and I was told I couldn’t reserve it so I called the spa and they said they aren’t utilizing it right now and said we could use it. The day before another local family was it in the spa cabana so I’m not sure why they told us we couldn’t use it for 280$ we should be able to use any of the available cabanas.  We spent Friday, Saturday, and Sunday at the hotel and each time we went to the pool the bartenders never greeted us or asked if we needed something. A simple good morning or Aloha would of made it a better experience. We also never received the complimentary bottles of water after the first day.",Dec 2020,December 2020,Traveled as a couple,,

Our ocean front room had a breath taking view and my baby had so much fun that she didn’t want to go home. The hotel staffs were so friendly, professional, and helpful with true aloha spirit that they made our stay extra special.    Besides from the view, the room was fantastic. The fact there is a separate bath tub and a shower was so nice. Also, the TOTO washlet toilet was so comfy!

751562185,50,Prince Waikiki,"We rented two rooms at Prince Waikiki and they were kind enough to work with us to get us two adjoining rooms with a door in between the rooms.    What makes this hotel is the people there. From the doormen to the front desk to the housekeeping, everybody was great and respectful. The only downside I had was it took a long time for my wife to get a menu while at the pool, but even the waitress there was respectful.    The rooms themselves were good. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom were great. The washlets were new to me but I want to install one now at home because of the crazy TP shortage. The views from the wall to ceiling windows were breath taking. We had rooms directly across from the elevators and we didn’t notice any noise from the other guests at all. The carpets were a little worn however but that’s the only negative thing I saw with the room itself.    We rented a Nissan Armada (pretty tall vehicle) while we were there and the parking garage was too small to comfortably park it. We were told to stay on the ground floor of the parking garage and had difficulty maneuvering it down there so I had valet park the time we were there. Which was ok as the valet parking price was only $8 extra per night and was worth it.    Overall the people at the hotel made our experience there pleasurable.

Infinity pool was fabulous with another warm-water pool and a jacuzzi.  Late check-out was allowed.  No parking fee. I paid a daily fee of $30 at a nearby hotel before staying at Prince.  Emergency evacuation system worked perfectly assuring safety for guests. Only that the in-room alarm was activated before 0700 hours and we were on the 27th floor thereby having to walk down so many stairs with other guests.

751318602,40,Honey moon experience,"My husband and I stayed at the Prince Waikiki for 6 nights (end of January till beginning of February this year) for our Honeymoon and it was great.  We had a room on the 30th floor and had an amazing view of the harbor, the beach that's a little farther away and some buildings.  The staff was friendly and the room was nicely decorated and clean. The bathroom was relatively large and the water flow from the shower was excellent.  The pool and whirlpool are located on the 5th floor. They aren't big so if it's high season I wouldn't recommend going to the pool nor whirlpool. I estimate that only 5 people could be in the whirlpool comfortably. When we were there however it was very quiet at the poolside so it was perfect.  The service at the poolside is great, while the drinks and food up there are average. I would recommend the cabanas up at the front. They are big, private, and include a mini refrigerator. Just make sure you don't get the one that has no upper coverage, cause then you won't be able to hide from the sun.  You will be able to see the Friday fireworks clearly from the poolside. Don't expect too much though; it's only a 5 minutes show.  I also really liked the view inside the full glass elevator.  Finally I find the location of this hotel to be excellent. It's not on Waikiki Beach itself, so it;s not crowded when you step outside, but it's close enough to it and close to many good restaurants and other places. You can walk to the Ala Moana shopping mall from there and within 2 minutes you can find for example an IHOP or a Red Lobster. There are also bus stops close by.  All by all a great hotel that I would surely recommend.",Mar 2020,January 2020,,,Curaçao

745568423,30,Disappointing,"We booked this hotel as it was Number 1 on Tripadvisor and all the reviews were excellent. So you can imagine we had high expectations. Location was good- away from the crowds and business of Waikiki beach and a nice walk from the hotel to the action. We booked the Club Lounge room and access. The Club Lounge was disappointing- very limited choices of food for breakfast - we didn't expect a buffet or anything but there were three options- one was Miso soup which we didn't eat. There was a an egg option sometimes eg scrambled but was always cold. We stopped going there for breakfast after three days. Also only one choice of white wine, and beer. .For the price we were paying this was poor value. This is not a cheap hotel so we expected more. We hired a cabana at the pool for half a day and included was water bottles sunscreen and two cocktails and a pizza- this was good value and the service was excellent. The room was fabulous big and stunning view of the ocean, sunsets and fireworks. It was cleaned beautifully. One other small issue was on our last day, we left the ""Do not disturb"" sign on our door by mistake when we went out so the room wasn't cleaned and housekeeping left a note.asking us to call when we wanted our room cleaned which was nice.. So I called and asked them not to worry about cleaning the room as we were checking out early the next morning, but could they bring us clean towels and take away the rubbish and a few dirty plates we had there. When we returned, we had new towels but the rubbish and plates were still there. They didn't leave us any water either which is included daily. So we had a early pick up to the airport at 4 15am so I get up and turn on a tap on-no water. Check shower-no water. So I ring front desk and they tell me there is scheduled maintenance on their water supply and there would be no water between 4 15-5 am! We had an 11 hour flight coming up and we weren't able to shower and we had received no notification.Let's just say we weren't happy. AS we were leaving our room to check out and doing a final check I found a piece of paper on the bench telling us about the water disruption. Was it left under the door and housekeeping picked it up and put it on the bench? We don't know but surely there should be some reliable way of letting guests know this? we had a wake up call booked- perhaps they could have mentioned it then to us when we ""Oh by the way are you aware that there is a disruption to the water in the morning?",Feb 2020,February 2020,,,"Melbourne, Australia"

We wanted a quieter experience as a couple without lots of kids running around. This was perfect. Their attention to detail was impeccable. We received a personalized bottle of champagne in our room!

743964363,50,Very comfortable stay,We stayed here for 5 days and it was the best stay. The hotel lobby is a good size and clean and quiet. The check in staff are very welcoming and friendly. The rooms are very quiet and a good size and they come with the Japanese toilet which is a bonus. The hotel is situated in the harbour area so a bit away from the main strip but we liked being out of the hustle bustle of Waikiki. The swimming pool and infinity pool are a treat.    We will definitely stay here again. We really felt at home. And if you book through their website you get the best deal.,Feb 2020,February 2020,,,

Only small complaint was the lack of any shade at the pool.",Feb 2020,January 2020,,,"Kaunakakai, Hawaii"
743690938,40,Careful on holiday weekends,Terrific hotel I like its location. and room views are 100% fantastic.    A word to wise will apply to few people but is important. On holidays Honolulu has parades. The parades literally cut off the hotel driving to elsewhere including the airport. As such I missed my flight and it was a major inconvenience for my onward trip. Noticing the parade in the hotel newsletter I asked about it the night before and the desk clerk wrote out a “detour” which was wrong and useless. There is no detour. Why the hotel doesn’t have the common sense to slip a note under the door of those they know are planning to check out is dumbfounding. The note should say “you will not be able to drive cars from the hotel between 9 and 11AM” or whatever so please plan accordingly.    The hotel did make right by me which is why I’m not rating lower but they should really know better how to help guests manage the situation since it surely happens all the time. Signs in elevators. In the parking garage. Under room doors. Fully trained desk clerks.,Feb 2020,February 2020,,,"Cleveland, Ohio"

743056809,50,Worth It!,"Listen, I love and I've stayed in nice hotels/resorts, my expectations are typically high! I decided not to get overly excited because some top notch hotels or resorts don't give you the top notch vibes but Prince Waikiki came all the way through! I had a rough night earlier but the moment I walked into the lobby, I quickly forgot about my previous accommodation sorrows. First I was able to get an extra early check-in plus an upgrade for no extra charge. Listen, I was so close to hugging the nice and sweet lady who checked me in. Free welcome beverages too and for two! The room was clean, friendly staff, pool amazing! The hotel is surrounded with views of everything. The harbor, diamond head etc. There is also a supermarket in the lobby as well as a cafe and restaurant on the second floor. There are also nearby beaches and restaurants all within a walking distance. The view of the Sunset from the pool, omg! My room also had a fantastic view of the harbor. The breakfast buffet was everything, I'm not even a breakfast person but I was very impressed. I was torn between the Alohiani Hotel and Prince Waikiki but I'm glad I went my choice because I ended up going to Alohiani with a friend earlier that week, the difference is crystal clear. I know people say don't believe the hype but this hype is an exception because I'm not easily impressed. Highly Recommend! I'll always stay here anytime I'm back in Waikiki.",Feb 2020,January 2020,,,

The rooms are very nice. And if you are interested in shopping, you are very close to Ala Moana Shopping center. You are close to the beaches and overlook the boat harbor. Great ocean views. The only negative I have is related to the upscale restaurant in the hotel- Katsu Midori Tokyo. This restaurant definitely caters to Asians, and, in fact, the hostess barely spoke English. The menu is expansive and we had to go through it many times before ordering on the tablet (only way to order). The server wasn't very helpful. But, worst of all, we were asked to leave after 90 minutes as that was all the time we were allowed-- and the next customer for our table was waiting! When we asked if we could do a room charge, we were told they would have to call the hotel (which they were in) and verify our cc was still accepting charges???? The sushi was very good, though.",Feb 2020,January 2020,,,connecticut
742529599,40,Best value for your $,We loved our stay at the Prince Waikiki. The rooms were spacious and clean with Maile amenities. All of the staff were friendly and courteous.    The only downside was that I left some baby food out on the counter overnight and there were small ants on it in the morning. Also that you can hear the noise from the pool downstairs in the room. The pool is open 24 hours and we heard people having a blast at 4am.    I would still recommend staying here over other hotels in Waikiki unless you are willing to pay over $500/night. It is definitely the best bang for your buck.,Feb 2020,January 2020,,,

The windows open wide and large as if its a balcony but not. I was able to tan on my bed in my room. Do get the club level room and pass, as its nice to get on tap wine, beer and snacks all day!

Another example was the bathroom was lacking toothbrushes/razor as I forgot mine. I called and this was corrected.  I was disapointed in the 100 Sails dinner buffet, it used to be a premier dining experience, but now it is very average due to selections/quality.

740558737,50,Perfect for Honolulu,"We stayed here for 1 night before a cruise. We arrived late in Honolulu and the Hotel is a 15 minute drive from the airport. It is located by a marina and separated by a small road. The check in experience was seamless and the staff were very friendly. We were given a high floor room. The room itself was fairly large and comfortable. It had all the mod cons you would expect. We had a sea view room that also overlooked the pool area below.    The Hotel has a pool, gym and a couple of restaurants. There is also a coffee shop located in the reception area as well as a small shop that sells snacks and drinks as well as souvenirs.    Location wise it sits between Honolulu center and Waikiki beach. Waikiki is a 10 minute walk by the coast and Honolulu center is about 15 mins away. There is a large shopping mall about 10 minutes away.    If you like the quieter side of Waikiki then this is the ideal place.

740555505,50,Heaven in Hawaii with the best hotel staff ever,"Have just spent 8 nights at the Prince Waikiki and the staff from those on the front desk, to the Prince Club Concierge’s, to the housekeepers, bell staff, shuttle drivers and the bar staff at 100 Sails. All were absolutely exceptional. The best staff in the world. They’re a credit to the hotel. We were a family of three travelling with a 12 year old. We were all in one room which was tight but the bathroom was huge and fabulous and the product was gorgeous. The cupboard and storage was generous too. We had access to the Club which was fantastic. We could always grab a bite and a drink whenever we wanted. Happy Hour at 100 Sails was awesome (do the wings!!) and cheap and the location is FAB. A five minute walk to Ala Moana (you’ll spend 3 of these minutes waiting for the crossing lights) and we didn’t realise but you can scoot around the marina through the Hilton Hawaiian to the beach or walk along the beachfront from there to Waikiki which is far nicer than walking along the street.  A special shout out to the very kind lady (concierge) in the Prince Club at 6.45am on January 21 who arranged us a taxi van to the airport. We had heaps of bags and an Uber XL was going to be $110. She organised a taxi van for $29 flat rate (plus $1 per bag). The van driver was superb too. The location of this hotel is awesome. Within 5 minutes walk of Ala Moana, a beach in front of the Hilton Hawaiian and some fab eating spots. Whoever does the hiring at this hotel deserves a medal. A tip- if you miss the hotel shuttle - grab a Lyft. We found them far cheaper than an Uber. Also worth hiring a car for a day or two. We did and it’s SO easy to park at The Prince and a bargain (free) if it’s in your room deal. Thank you Prince staff.

Because we had a baby with us, we booked a Club Level to have easy access to breakfast and snacks throughout the day and planned to use the hotel a lot more than we normally would on these trips. The resort fell short of our expectations and we left disappointed.    The check-in process was not smooth, which was a bad first impression. Our room key didn't work, our garage parking key didn't work multiple times, then our access to Club Lounge didn't work. That finally got sorted out two days. We had loud neighbors for two nights, where it was so bad, we could smell smoke in our rooms as well as loud music and what sounded like a huge party. The second night, I called to complain multiple times at 10pm, 11:30pm and then 1:30pm. We have a toddler, so this was not fun for us and we spent the next day in a foggy haze because of the lack of sleep for two nights in a row. I called to speak to management and all he did was apologize. Upon check-out, I asked for compensation, as to me, I felt like I lost one night because of the noise and their lack of attention to it, Just got a $50 credit off my bill. The hotel itself is nice and clean and we loved the pools, but they really need to listen to their customers more. We are returning in March solely for the location and accessibility to Ala Moana mall, the beach, and Waikiki.

The hotel is an updated one. Staff and valet are polite and nice. It has floor to ceiling windows to makeup for the balcony.

What an incredible hotel and staff at Prince!! We could not have been happier. The customer service excelled throughout our stay, from upgrading our room unprovoked when it was deemed our original room was not well suited for our stay to quickly calling and paying for a cab to take us to the shopping district because the shuttle was running a bit behind. My only negative would be that their fitness facility is much too small for the caliber of the rest of the hotel but that is really digging for an area of improvement to be honest.    Guy who was one of the bellmen at the concierge desk was beyond helpful and when I attempted to give him an additional $50 tip for his going above and beyond for us after only receiving a $10 tip for bringing our bags up, he kindly refused the second tip. I was dumbfounded and tried to urge him to accept the tip as it was well earned. Guy simply smiled kindly and told me the initial tip was appreciated and all he needed.

It is also an easy walk from the Ala Moana shops, and a pleasant half an hour stroll along the ocean walk to Waikiki. The biggest plus for us was the fact that we could get excellent coffee at the Honolulu Coffee Company cafe located right in the lobby! On the negative side was the lack of balconies in the rooms.

The evening we dined here it was also quite noisy with children, and if you’re interested in quiet dining, this is probably not the place for you, particularly at the supper hour.

The teens enjoyed the pool area, mocktails and the fact that the hotel is ""not full of"" small kids running around! We had 2 daily breakfasts included in our room and the hotel allowed us to credit days not used to be used other days for all 4 of us - kind, friendly service. Self parking was easy, shuttle service to Waikiki, if needed and perfect location to get in and out of the area to explore other parts of the island. We would recommend this hotel highly for a family with older kids or couples travelling without children.",Jan 2020,December 2019,,,"Seattle, Washington"
739275823,50,Wonderful! Everything superb!,"We went to Hawaii for our anniversary...my husband planned the trip, and picked this hotel. He picked a winner. Everything about our stay was awesome. Turn down service every night, with chocolates, bottled water,and anything else you wanted. This place is in the perfect location with beautiful views. Get a high floor in middle,and you get the perfect panoramic view of the ocean,and beach. The entire staff was superb,and helpful in everyway. Free hotel shuttle to various places, and so many things close enough to walk to.

739235922,50,Why did we choose Prince Waikiki?,"We based our choice of hotel on Tripadvisor reviews as we have not been to Honolulu before and we must say that we were impressed.  If you want to be right on Waikiki Beach this is not your hotel but there is a shuttle to the beach if that is where you want to be or you can walk it which is what we did twice.  We have stayed in many Executive Club rooms over the years and the fact that it was a very high level we did enjoy the views over the marina and ocean. Sunsets were fantastic!!  The Prince Club is very small but adequate as there do not seem to be many people using it. The fact that you could have a breakfast, lunch and evening meal and all day wine and beer was extraordinary.  This was a Christmas trip and the staff did get into the spirit as did the hotel.  We did also take advantage of the happy hours at the restaurant bar and having a coffee bar in the foyer was great.  I think that we would totally recommend this hotel to the discerning traveller.",Jan 2020,December 2019,,,"Sydney, Australia"
739014172,40,Good,"Actually really enjoyed stay. Love hotel location and is within walking distance to the beach. Would definitely recommend getting the club lounge access if you plan on spending a good amount of time at the hotel, can easily save on breakfast/lunch/dinner.    Service was excellent up until last night (Jan 13th). Pool bar supposed to close at 7pm, husband arrived to bar at 6:40 to grab a quick drink and was told it was closing (due to weather). Was not raining or anything, why lie about closing 20 min earlier than your supposed to? Then bartendet continued to linger around in the bar until 7pm anyways. Out of line on the bartenders part. Luckily all other staff showed integrity and professionalism during our stay.    Very strange that the door to the toilet was open at the top, bottom and side, no privacy when using the restroom.    Unfortunately had to dock a point for the indiscrepensies.",Jan 2020,January 2020,Traveled as a couple,,

738716548,50,The ONLY place to call home in Waikiki,"From the moment you walk in the door and get greeted by Mark you know you are 'home'.    In a city that is full of dated and daggy hotels, Prince Waikiki is a refreshing change from the usual suspects on the strip. Having undergone a complete renovation you can be assured that the rooms are up to date, roomy, luxurious and the service is friendly and attentive.    One thing to note is that the hotel is very much geared to the Japanese market. There are so many benefits to this - gorgeous full Japanese bathrooms and toilets, beautiful attention to detail throughout the hotel, food catered towards a Japanese diet and the pool area tends to be very calm and relaxing.    We highly recommend taking out a room with Club Room access. The selections are extensive and generous and the staff are very helpful and knowledgable.    If you don't want to invest in this there are so many dining options for all budgets - from express breakfasts (so cost effective) through to lavish buffets.    The location is perfect. Far away enough from the carry on of Waikiki but close enough to enjoy the fun of either the main areas or Ala Moana. There is complimentary shuttles that takes you to the main areas leaving regularly enough and the walk is pleasant if you prefer.    I can't recommend this hotel enough, for either the travelling family or solo adventurer it really is lovely.",Jan 2020,January 2020,,All rooms have a great view but splurge and get one with Club Room Access.,"Melbourne, Australia"
738519856,50,The reviews don’t lie: Read this for a comparison of different Waikiki/Oahu hotel experiences,"We had only two nights on Oahu before heading out to the Big Island. We were traveling with friends who wanted to stay in the Waikiki area so we opted to try TripAdvisor’s #1 rated hotel and were not disappointed. Details below.    We had stayed in various hotels in the Waikiki area so we know the lay of the land pretty well. The resorts right on the beach can be nice but most of them have very little beach area. We’re from Los Angeles so we are used to very wide, expansive beaches. Waikiki beach is often very, very narrow and with tons of hotel guests, not much sand space available to relax. Plus, there is a strong tourist-trap vibe to many of the establishments along the waterfront and it can be noisy and crowded.    Once we stayed at a hotel tower a couple of blocks from the beach and got a sliver of an ocean view between other hotel towers. Cheaper than waterfront but with the limited view, could have been at any other hotel tower. We also stayed once at the New Otani at the (south?) end of Waikiki toward Diamond Head. That hotel has very small rooms but a great beach and a bit less hectic than hotels in the center of Waikiki.    We have stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village and enjoyed an amazing suite with Diamond Head views. HHV is not for everyone—tons of families and activities, but it does have the broadest beach on Waikiki and you never have to leave the property if you don’t want to explore the island.    On other trips, we have stayed at the Kahala Resort beyond Diamond Head and nearer to Hanauma Bay. That’s one of my favorite resorts of all (see separate review) and is not too far from the action at Waikiki. We also had a very nice stays at Turtle Bay Resort in the North Shore and Marriott Ko-Olina (see separate reviews). Each has its charms but locations offer a very different experience than staying in Waikiki, which offers a lot more restaurant and shopping options.    So, now to Prince Waikiki: if I wanted to stay close into Waikiki, I would definitely consider this hotel. It offers probably one of the best values in Waikiki hotels, with large rooms and available ocean views that are really terrific, with huge floor to ceiling windows that actually open so you can smell the ocean air. It does NOT have lanai’s (balconies). But it is a genuine ocean view (overlooking the marina and depending on room, a view of the beach at the Hilton or the beach park looking toward Honolulu). See my photo for an example of the view at sunset.    While the hotel is perhaps two blocks to the beach, it is an easy, picturesque walk. The hotel is also situated so that you can drive a rental car in and out without constantly fighting mid-Waikiki traffic. There is also a hotel shuttle that is helpful. The pool is not huge but does offer a beautiful view of the ocean. We booked a cabana that includes a lot of stuff for $50 (drinks, pizza, sunscreen) but it was too windy the day we reserved so we cancelled, no hassle.    The hotel staff is fantastic, friendly and laid back. We did not eat in the restaurants but the friends we traveled with ate at the sushi place in the hotel and reported that it was delish. There is a good coffee bar and market/gift shop that is convenient.    The location of the hotel offers easy walking access to many restaurants and shops, whether at the Ala Moana shopping center, HHV or Waikiki.    Another note: because this is a Prince property, the hotel caters to a lot of tourists from Japan. Best consequence of this: the toilets have Toto bidet-style seats. If you’ve never tried this, worth considering the hotel for that reason alone.    Booking tip: booking directly at the hotel’s website and joining the Prince loyalty program gets you the best rates and the possibility of having the resort fee waived—important because that gets you free self-parking (!) and Internet access. Also, spring for an ocean view room—totally worth it.",Jan 2020,January 2020,Traveled with friends,,"Culver City, California"

The Prince was much better than the village! It’s newer, cleaner and not crawling with people like the village. So much better! Be careful with your kids though at the infinity pool. It’s too narrow for children swimming and playing, but of course they want to try anyway. If you allow your kids to swim in this pool, we suggest you stay very close and watch them every moment. We were so terrified our daughter might fall over the edge. It’s at least a little unnerving, and even more so after one of the hotel employees told us that 3 children had died this past year from injuries sustained after falling over the edge!",Jan 2020,December 2019,Traveled with family,,"Sugar Land, Texas"

Couldn’t sleep from all the street noise outside at ALL hours of the night.    Pool not heated so everyone was trying to cram into the hot tub. Including the 1,000 screaming splashing children that overrun the very small pool area.    Pool area menu was extremely limited.    Shocked at the “authentic” sushi at their sushi restaurant. Every single roll came slathered in some kind of gross mayo/cream sauce and the pieces were too big to take down in one bite. That ain’t authentic.    Rooms were clean yes, but having clean rooms is literally the least any hotel could do. The combination toilet/bidet was nice. Staff was friendly.

Beautiful property, great views, pool, food but most of all the staff is just sensational.

Second visit to the pool and I was greeted w/ ""Would you like another (whatever I had to drink the day before)?"" (Fine: it was vodka. Don't judge.) Self-parking in Waikiki is unheard of, but the Prince has it and if you're in-and-out a lot, as we were, it's a great perq.

732714795,50,Heaven on Earth!,"I spent 7 days with my daughter at the Prince Waikiki in a one bedroom ocean view suite. It was amazing.    Pros:  -The suite is spacious, the beds are comfortable and the bathroom has a separate shower (which is a must for me);  -The living room view and the view from the bedroom is spectacular! The floor to ceiling windows allow for a tremendous view of the ocean, the marina and the city skyline;  -The pool area is spacious, the pool staff is attentive and when we were there, it wasn’t crowded;  -The hotel staff in general was very pleasant and welcoming;  -The hotel is located near a stop that is a pickup for a number of excursions—it’s just a 2 or 3 minute walk which was convenient.    Cons:    My cons are minimal.  -I was originally traveling over the Thanksgiving holiday. Due to a sudden death in the family, I had to reschedule. The hotel charged the increased rates for the new dates. I thought that there would be some latitude given the reason for the change but no such luck.    -Housekeeping was solid but not spectacular (i.e. I had to repeatedly ask for toiletries, extra towels).    With that being said, I did not want to leave! This was my third trip to Oahu. When I do return, it will be to the Prince Waikiki.",Dec 2019,December 2019,Traveled with family,,"Upper Marlboro, Maryland"

It was great seeing the runners all over town in the following days, with their bright orange “finisher” t-shirts.  The staff here is very helpful and friendly. I loved the Malie facial and hair care products that were in the room. The weather was great, which always helps when vacationing.

The check-in was easy, the room was beautiful and very clean but the amazing open windows to the marina and open ocean sealed it for me. Incredible. I’ve never been so thrilled to see windows in my life. What an amazing feature. It truly set this hotel apart from any I have ever stayed in. The pool and facilities were beautiful, as well. If you have the opportunity to stay here, I promise that you will not be disappointed. We certainly were not. Thank you for a wonderful stay. We were terrifyingly caught at the Pearl Harbor Memorial during the active shooter tragedy and it sadly changed how we approached the remainder of our stay in Waikiki but we are grateful to so many wonderful people for being so kind. Although we are still shaken, we are not deterred and will absolutely return to complete our original plans. Thank you, again for the kindness and compassion.

730459546,40,Fun in Honolulu,"I had Club Lounge privileges during my stay, and I'm thinking this made some difference in my overall enjoyment of the Prince Waikiki. (My traveling companion did not, so I was able to observe variable levels of customer service/amenities.) The service and food and drink options in the Club Lounge were excellent!    Beyond the Lounge, special mention goes to the staff of the Hinana Bar, adjacent to the infinity pool on the 5th floor, and to the several helpful people at the Concierge desk. On the other hand, the bell/valet service was useless. Three or four men would be standing outside gabbing with one another while hotel visitors lugged their own bags in and out of non-electric doors. Upon departure, I carried my own bags down from my room on the 31st floor because I had no confidence they would be fetched in time for me to leave for the airport. (I have no idea how long it took for them to be placed in my room when I arrived because, after waiting 15 minutes, I left for dinner.)    The fitness room is sufficient (if overheated) but offers no floor space for mat exercises that doesn't interfere with other patrons' gym activities. I appreciated that 24/7 access is allowed.

727187143,50,Elegant Stay away from the Hustle and Bustle,"For our first trip to Oahu, we decided to stay at the Prince Waikiki based on the high tripadvisor reviews and given that we did not need to have a beachfront location.    Pros:  - large comfortable room, including the bathroom, which had a Japanese style toilet  - nice view of the harbour and remote blackout blinds  - self parking included in the resort fee  - inexpensive express breakfast offered at the hotel  - service was polite and attentive (nice little touches like turndown service, complimentary fruit one night)  - quiet location  - easy car access to the main road  - complimentary shuttle service to Ala Moana shopping Center and the main Waikiki shopping area    Cons:  - shuttle does not run early or very late  - less dining options nearby (the Hilton Hawaiian is a couple of blocks away and has several dining options or you can take the shuttle to Ala Moana Center for dining options)    Overall, if you are looking for a hotel that offers a lot of beachfront activities, this is not the hotel for you. However, if you are looking for an elegant, relaxing, low-key stay and plan to do a lot of exploring by car, this hotel is ideal.",Nov 2019,November 2019,,,

I could not get over the view of the sunset every night. When the windows are open it really brings the environment inside.  2. The staff are fantastic. They are friendly, helpful and attentive. I felt so at home.  3. The rooms have great amenities including luxury Malie toiletries, a bidet, and very comfy beds.  4. Buffet breakfast at 100 Sails was fantastic. I loved the food, especially the omelets, curry, fruit, poi malasadas and coffee. Great selection! The staff including Lelani were friendly and provided exceptional service.  5. The coffee shop and gift shop onsite are so convenient and have a great selection of snacks and gifts.  I already miss the hotel and plan to go back and stay there again next year. I cannot imagine staying anywhere else.",Nov 2019,November 2019,,,

725841825,50,Amazing and thoughtful,"I always enjoy staying at the Prince Waikiki because of the cleanliness of the rooms and the amazing service. We booked a couple of nights for a staycation to celebrate our anniversary. When we checked in, our room was upgraded and we received coupons for free drinks (coffee/tea/beer/wine) and mimosas at the restaurant. In our room, there was champaign, chocolate covered strawberries, and a nice note from the general manager. It was such a thoughtful touch that really made the night. We enjoyed the strawberries and champaign while watching the Friday night fireworks that we could see from our window.  The room was spacious and clean. It had a very comfortable king sized bed and small sitting area with a couch. The bathroom was also spacious with both a bathtub and shower.  We also booked a pool cabana for half a day (11-3pm) for $50. It was completely worth it because we had our own space and it came with 4 bottles of water, 2 cocktails, sunscreen, and a pizza. I would highly suggest reserving a cabana if you want to spend time at the pool.  Lastly, the food at the 100 Sails restaurant is delicious. We tried the dinner and breakfast buffet. The dinner buffet included crab and made to order sushi rolls. The breakfast buffet included an omelette station and many savory and sweet options. Both had delicious food but my favorite was the breakfast buffet.    Our stay at the Prince was memorable and very enjoyable. I will be coming back for staycations and recommending it to others. The general manager and the staff provided wonderful service. It was all the small touches that really made a difference.",Nov 2019,November 2019,Traveled as a couple,,

We had a one bedroom suite, which had a queen size sofa bed in the lounge for the kids. Luckily we had two bathrooms as the design of the master shower is terrible. As it is a shower over the bath, the water pools around the edge of the bath and also it took forever for the water to go down the drain. While showering, you are also bathing! We just used the other shower which was a fully tiled box shower. They were also having issues with the sprinkler system on our floor. There had been a major leak and the carpet was saturated outside our room. It also smelt really bad. For the length of our stay there was a large trash bin to collect the water. We couldn't smell anything in our room so it didn't affect our stay. Front house staff and housekeeping were outstanding. We had the express breakfast at the restaurant every day. At $5.99 it was outstanding value.",Nov 2019,November 2019,Traveled with family,,"Auckland Central, New Zealand"

The pools and cabanas were more than expected and the lobby and shops within it were top notch. We opted for the ""club"" experience and were not disappointed.

The consingere were helpful in making arrangements, giving advice on what we should go see and what was not worth the trouble. The room was nice and clean, bed comfortable and the view of the marina and pool was lovely. The beach was about a five minute walk in both direction. The pool was never overly crowded it was quite and love that it was open 24 hours. The only draw back was there was not any entertainment at the hotel, but we walked to other hotels for nightly entertainment. Breakfast was included with our stay and it was way then enough options.

724713999,40,Very Good Choice for a Quieter Waikiki Stay,"I come through Honolulu regularly (once every couple of years) either heading for the Big Island or coming back. I like to stay in Honolulu for the food and for shopping. For the last couple of stays, the Modern Hotel a block away was my usual choice. Actually, back in the day, the Kahala when it was a Mandarin was great. The Modern was a more understated choice. It appears the Prince is now top of the pile because it was recently renovated, and it turned out to be a good choice.    I reserved very last minute, so I got a 1-bedroom suite at a steep discount, about USD 700 per day. The views from the suite were amazing. The room itself - very few complaints. One minor episode was the radio. After the room is cleaned or after turn down, it appears the staff intentionally leave the radio on at low volume. Mine happened to be tuned to a talk radio station. When I returned to my room at night, it sounded as if I could hear the conversation in the next room. Turned out my radio was on. Took me about an hour to figure that out.    The furnishings of the room are good. Again, this was a suite, so plenty of storage. No issues with the coffee machine, Wifi, TVs (with Netflix), refrigerator (please consider including creamers for coffee in fridge). Bathroom was huge, amenities were in-house brand (just OK - I used my own shampoo, etc.).    Breakfast at the lobby restaurant was nice, waitress was very actively filling my coffee cup.    The gym was well furnished.    The gym is next to a deck area which has the pool and bar. I didn't find the vibe of the bar area that welcoming - decided to take sunset photos from my room instead.    The staff at the hotel are cheerful. My impression is they won't go out of their way as you would see at a top resort, but for being at a large hotel as part of the Waikiki market, they seemed on top of things and helpful.    The main driver for selecting this hotel was the proximity to the Ala Moana Mall. However, seeing that the offerings of the mall have gone down a bit, I might consider a stay at another place. If your main driver is the mall, then this is the best choice.",Nov 2019,October 2019,,,"Seoul, South Korea"

Every staff member and departments have been so warm, attentive and helpful. At HHV, staff is overwhelmed and it is chaos. The hotel is super clean and it is so easy to find your way around. I love being so close to Ala Moana Mall, only about a 7 min walk, one of the top malls in the US.  I have approached management a few times with requests or to ask a question, I found them very approachable and attentive.

It is at the end of the ""strip"" but it's about a 10 minute walk to the centre of Waikiki's tourist district. The hotel does provide shuttle bus service (which I didn't use because we had a car and we like walking).    It's not a beach front hotel so that's good and bad but not being beach front means that there's less foot traffic (which we like).

They leave the door open to where the food is kept and birds fly in. We were grabbing dinner our second night when we found bird drippings in the silverware. We told the lady working and she simply cleaned off the dropping and put it back. We decided against eating there again. The room had a fantastic view and everyone was super friendly to us. We ordered room service and it came very quick, and it was wonderful. I thought I was having allergies to the area because it's tropical and all. Turns out they have down bedding and I am very allergic. I figured that out the last night we were staying unfortunately. I told the front desk and they replaced my pillows so I at least could breath when flying out the next day! They were very apologetic. I wish our stay was longer.

Book through Costco Travel if you can. I got 40% off golf and a ton of free drink coupons.    2. The 100 Sails restaurant food was just OK. If you're OK just eating a burger or something simple, it's for you. If you're looking for a solid steak or something higher-end, go elsewhere.    3. Skip the spa/massage. Overpriced and the quality was mediocre.    4. The pool area is incredibly windy. It's like a wind tunnel between the buildings and the pool.

718918740,50,Our stay was EXCELLENT!,"My wife and I stayed here in October 2019 for 5 nights. She found a great deal from Costco, and this hotel did not disappoint. The Costco promo included major benefits to us, such as a room discount, breakfast every morning at 100 Sails, as well as self-parking being included in our price and was not an extra. These benefits were the main reasons we stayed at Prince Waikiki, but there are several other reasons why this hotel was a great find!    Firstly, I cannot say enough about the hotel staff. They were amazing, very courteous, knowledgeable, and accommodating to us. As this was our first trip to Hawaii, we were excited, but also not sure what to expect. Upon checking in, we were regularly greeted by our last name, and the staff of 100 Sails went above and beyond in our opinion to ensure our stay was the best. I have had good service at previous hotels in other cities, but Prince takes the title of the best service I have ever experienced.    The next best thing about this hotel is the location. It is only a short walk to Waikiki Beach, which we did twice. There is also a shuttle service, but we did not take it, so I cannot comment on that part. The location next to the harbor is peaceful, quiet, and not as crowded (cars and people) as other areas closer to Waikiki Beach. As this hotel was not at Waikiki Beach this meant we did not have as much trouble with the often congested Honolulu traffic. We were also within a short walk to Ala Moana Center, which was great for shopping and quick / cheap places to eat.    If you don't need to walk out of your hotel right on to a beach, but still want quick access this hotel is for you. If you want to be able to get out of the downtown area quickly so you can spend more time exploring the natural beauty of Oahu, this hotel is for you.    We would definitely stay at this hotel again!",Oct 2019,October 2019,Traveled as a couple,,

718639595,50,Great place to stay in Waikiki,"I did a lot of research before booking this room and what sealed the deal, no hidden costs! The price online is what you pay. There are no daily resort fees or parking fees added on to the price of the room. And going through their website, the 4th night was free. Once you arrive at the hotel for check in, they greet you with a warm hand towel. Our room wasn't ready, but we were early and they gave us 2 free drink tickets to use at the poolside bar or coffee shop while we waited. The rooms are clean and spacious with a gorgeous view of the harbor. Easy walking distance to shops and the beach, but they also have a free shuttle to take you further down the road. The refrigerator is restocked with 2 free water bottles every day and at night they deliver a small treat. Since we were celebrating a birthday, they had a birthday cake waiting for us in the room. And another perk, Toto toilets! The staff go out of their way to make sure you are enjoying your stay at the Prince Waikiki.",Oct 2019,October 2019,,,

I love the fact that there is a separate shower not over a bath tub. And it's roomy too. The beds are so comfortable. The view is wonderful, there always something to watch, boats, planes, people. It's fun. Service? It's second to none. 5 star? At least! My husband and I celebrated our anniversary and The Prince made this a very special celebration for us. From the moment you are greeted at the front door you are made to feel welcome. They try to accommodate every need, in our case we were hoping for a high floor and they gave us it to us. And always with a smile. The restaurant has great food and an amazing seafood buffet! And a great breakfast! In all honesty, we would not stay anywhere else, this hotel caters for it all.

The design of the hotel from the lobby to the rooms is modern and luxurious. Everything was spotlessly clean and the beds are really comfortable. And the views!!We had a room on the 29th floor and had the most amazing views of the harbour and ocean through the floor to ceiling windows. The pool area is clean and lovely place to relax. The hotel is situated close enough to the centre of Waikiki that it is easy to walk but also far enough out that you get a quiet and calm atmosphere compared with the hustle and bustle of the centre. Check in was a smooth and quick process dealt with by friendly and accommodating staff who were also always on hand to help with any questions during our stay. We ordered a packed lunch to go one day which we took with us when we did a road trip around the island. This was ready promptly for us at the time we requested and was really good quality.

715504398,50,Absolutely loved it! Perfect stay!,"We stayed at Prince Waikiki for a week and we absolutely loved it from the moment we got there.  It was one of the highlights of our trip and our stay at Prince Waikiki confirmed why it was so highly rated on TripAdvisor.     The Room: The room had floor to ceiling windows and we had a beautiful view of the marina. Rooms were clean, spacious and nicely decorated. Beds and pillows were very comfortable. Room was equipped with everything we needed (fridge, slippers, clothes line,  ""to go"" coffee cups, flashlight). There was even a kettle,  which we appreciated,  since most hotels tend to only have a coffee maker (in which case your tea inevitably always tastes like coffee). We were even able to get a microwave for the room for no additional charge. As we were celebrating our anniversary, a complimentary bottle of wine was sent to our room,  which was a nice surprise.     The Hotel Grounds: Well-kept pool area and gym. We enjoyed the infinity pool over looking the marina. Lobby was grand and beautifully decorated, with relaxing Hawaiian music playing in the background.  Fruit infused water was available in the lobby. A few dining options were available on site.  We only tried the breakfast buffet at 100 Sails, which was a great buffet with many options including an omelette bar.     Service: The hotel staff was absolutely wonderful.  There was a kind gentleman at the valet, who warmly welcomed us upon our arrival.  We also interacted with the front desk staff,  restaurant staff, the shuttle bus driver and the concierge. All were pleasant, warm, genuine and helpful and tried to make your stay the best it could be.     Location: Hotel is located minutes from the Ala Moana Center, which was great since we went there a few times for meals and to buy some groceries from Foodland.  We liked that the hotel was in Waikiki but not in the center, so it wasn't as loud / crowded but yet close enough to the excitement.  Hotel is close to the Hilton, which means you could see the Friday night fireworks from an oceanfront room or from the pool deck.    Hotel Amenities: While you do have to pay a resort fee, you do get a lot as part of it.  In addition to access to the pool and the gym, we saw that there were activities like hula lessons that you could participate in if you like.  Through your resort fee, you also get a couple bottles of water each day, use of the phone in your room, self-parking, wifi and an environmental bag (which was pretty good quality and came in pretty handy) among other things.  There is also a shuttle service that runs between the Ala Moana Centre and Waikiki Beach, which was also helpful since parking in Waikiki could be difficult.

I had an Ocean Front room at the Ala Moana Tower on the 23rd floor. The view of the ocean from the bedroom is simply breathtaking! The room was very clean and big and contained pretty much all the amenities needed. Little treats like chocolate were provided every day during turndown service. If you’re missing something in the room just call and it will be taken care of in no time. When we entered our room we found a complimentary bottle of Prosecco with a card from the hotel wishing us happy anniversary. We enjoyed room service twice, we had one buffet breakfast and one a la carte breakfast at 100 Sails Restaurant and all were excellent! We also took had a cabana rental facing the ocean reserved for half a day that included 2 cocktail drinks, 2 bottle of water and a whole pizza. Totally worth it! Ala Moana Center was just 5 minutes walking for shopping.

The hotel staff is extremely service oriented, the resort is beautiful and the two restaurants on site are fantastic. We enjoyed daily an excellent breakfast buffet; we also had the dinner buffet one evening.  We loved the pool area and enjoyed having cocktails while enjoying the most amazing sunset views.  Although, the shopping centers and the Waikiki Beach are not within walking distance, the resort offers a shuttle service that runs every half hour so for us that was perfect.

709497120,50,Best of Both Worlds,"We had a wonderful stay at the Prince Waikiki and it was a combination of factors.    The location was perfect for us as we wanted to access Waikiki Beach which is a short walk away and if you wanted to go further towards Diamond Head there is always the free hotel shuttle bus. Then there is the very large Ala Moana mall with shops galore and restaurants too, which is just a few minutes walk inland or once again the free hotel shuttle bus goes there!!  Also we found this hotel to be a quiet haven. We went to a few of the other larger hotel chains along Waikiki Beach and it was crowded and noisy and we just got lost in the mass of humanity.    The staff was friendly without being familiar and we had great service from everyone. Called reception, concierge and housekeeping from our room and each time we had very positive responses. And what mattered most was the calls were answered with politeness and you can detect a 'smile' in their voices.  The room was spacious, well maintained and clean. Housekeeping did a perfect job each time and we did not have to request for anything. Tour desk was a great help in our bookings as we did all our excursions there. Concierge guys were great and most 'welcoming'.    Views from the room were fantastic and the sunsets were brilliant. A different spectacle each evening we were there. Also from our room we watched the fireworks display put on by the Hilton Hawaiian Village on Friday night.  We booked a club room as there was a good package deal that we got and this added to the wonderful experience we had. The club lounge was located just by the main pool and was a good place to relax coupled with friendly and helpful staff.  The hotel shuttle bus and the obliging drivers was a real added bonus to the stay.    All in all we loved the Prince Waikiki and would gladly recommend it to anyone.",Sep 2019,August 2019,,Get a room on a high floor on the north side of the hotel.,"Auckland,NZ"
709490154,50,Excellent Hotel,"Wow! What a hotel. Top notch service and quality. We walked towards the front desk and were immediately greeted with a smile and ""aloha"". We were quickly checked in, pleasurable small talk, and the freak desk clerk even played a fun little game with us, having us guess the sent inside the cool cloths that were provided. Great first impression.    I booked this hotel solely due to its beautiful views. Floor to ceiling windows are one of my most favorite things in life and not many hotels provide this. Prince Waikiki delivered with its views. The room was small. But my husband and I were so busy exploring the island that we didn't spend much time in the room anyway. We did LOVE the baday in the bathroom! Neither of us ever experienced one before and it was life changing.    We also appreciated the daily complimentary waters. We did a LOT of hiking while on Oahu so the waters really came in handy. We also appreciated that we could go to the front desk at anytime and ask for another water before we headed out for the day. Great service!    The hotel was very clean. I did not come across a single bug during our stay here.    Ive were on our honeymoon trip and I had let Price Waikiki know when I made the booking. Upon our arrival the cutest bottle of Champagne was in our fridge along with a congratulations note. It was the most adorable and welcoming present we received. It even had our names on the bottle! I wish I could have kept it as a keepsake.    We used the gym a few times while we were here and it really had everything you could need for a good, quick workout. The pool was beautiful and clean as well. There weren't many children here either, which for me was a major plus.    All if all if your looking for a great romantic get away this hotel is it. I could have easily spent the entire day just lounging around in the room with the giant windows open and then getting one drinks at the infinity pool. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone without kids.",Sep 2019,September 2019,Traveled as a couple,,"Renton, Washington"

707968237,50,Royalty experience at the Prince Waikiki,Family trip to Waikiki and what a great choice to stay at the Prince. Yes it is expensive but comparatively it is decent value. We had a club room on the 31st floor (Diamond Head Tower) and the view was breathtaking. We arrived late at the property for check-in around 1030pm and the service at check-in was great. Our luggage was brought up to our room and then the staff member spent time explaining the functions of the room. Also came back and brought extra slippers and water bottles.    The pool is on the 5th Floor and that is where we spent the majority of our time. The Mai Tai's were great to have by the pool. The Club Lounge is awesome and is super handy with kids as they are always hungry and they have a good option to grab a snack from the lounge. The staff at the lounge were amazing. Regardless of the time they were hospitable and made our stay memorable.    The 100 Sails restaurant is fantastic and the happy hour menu is great along with the drink specials.    We rented a vehicle and got some good recommendations from the concierge and front desk of where to eat on the North Shore and the different beaches.    Stay here and you won't be disappointed. Truly a royal experience.,Sep 2019,August 2019,,,"Vancouver, Canada"
707910797,30,Just average,"For a hotel that labels itself as ""luxury"", it fails to measure up, in my opinion. Having stayed at luxury resorts and luxury hotels in Hawaii, Prince Waikiki falls short.  An ocean front room, while it comes with a nice view, did not feel like a luxury room at all. All rooms at this hotel come with a view of the harbor, so the price for an upgraded room doesn't feel worth it.  Storage - Storage in the room is an absolute joke. There was ONE DRAWER available for storage. ONE. The dresser under the TV was constructed to hide a safe, a fridge, and a small bar set, leaving you with literally one drawer for storage. As someone who hates to live out of a suitcase while on a week-long vacation, I found the lack of storage space completely annoying. There is a closet with a few hangers, and a high shelf to put a few things, but storage is a definite problem  Bathroom - nice. However, the toilet is merely closed off by a glass door that does not touch the ceiling or the floor, so you can very much hear another person using the bathroom while in the shower, tub, or using the sink, and even in the bedroom. The shelf in the shower for toiletries is tiny and can fit maybe 3-4 mini toiletry bottles. The toilet is a fancy electric heated/bidet combo that my 6'1"" partner felt was too low to the ground for him to sit and get up from comfortably.  The ocean view room we got had a large banquet we felt was a waste of space. The near half of the room used for the banquet and a table area could have been used for an additional dresser to use for storage.  Service - housekeeping did a nice job and was always very fast. The front desk, however, seemed to be understaffed at all times. Upon check in at 4 PM, there were two people working the desk, one doing something at the computer besides checking customers from the increasing line. Walking through the lobby at all times of the day, I saw a line always formed for desk services. Check out at 12 PM had the same problem of two people working the desk with a long line. One or two other people at the desk would help.  Parking - we had parking included in our room package price, however the parking lot is a mess. Good luck finding parking if you park later than midday. Twice, we took the last available spot in the entire lot, and three times, the lot was full with no sign to alert drivers coming in.

A cold towel to cleanse ones self with is a welcome respite from the heat and the Hawaiian language book provided to our two children on arrival a welcoming and inclusive touch. This little bonus provided much entertainment for the proceeding half hour. Our immediate impression when we entered the room was ‘wow’, look at that view! Instantly you are flooded with images of the ocean, dancing sailboats and shimmering waters. It is simply breathtaking. The room itself is light and airy and provides adequate space for a family of four. My criticisms of the room were trivial but the difference bw an elite hotel and one who wishes to be. The tea selection is limited to green tea only, there is no milk in the refrigerator and the pillow selection is soft, soft or soft. In addition I will never understand why high end hotels provide the cheapest and most dangerous shavers 😏 The pool area of this hotel is lovely and provides another vantage point to watch a stunning sunset. The fact that the bar closes at 7pm is surprising and doesn’t really allow one time to sit and thoroughly enjoy the view whilst having food or beverage.

My view was not good and everyone on the deck could see into my room. This room had zero privacy and was loud. I didn't complain because I didn't have the time.

Friendly and efficient staff at every turn, comfy rooms with heaps of USB ports, great bath rooms, reliable wifi no balcony but openable windows. Nice pool area and GREAT Little gym for a hotel.  So if you are happy to be away from the noise of central Waikiki ( there’s a shuttle bus that can take you the 5 minutes back up the road) then this is the place for you.",Aug 2019,August 2019,Traveled as a couple,,"Melbourne, Australia"

701846324,40,Solid Choice - Location was not quite prime,"I would say this place is really 4 - 4.5 stars  The rooms are beautiful  The pool is beautiful  The location was fine for us, but it is on the outer edge of what I would consider the heart of Waikiki  The staff was - ehhhh / nothing special - I expected a little friendlier group since they tout themselves as the #1 hotel in Honolulu  Make sure to add the breakfast buffet to your reservation and be prepared to eat and eat - Very good  They have all elements to be excellent, but to truly be a 5 star hotel, you have to add those little human touches.  Again, I’m judging them against the claim of being #1 - not quite there in my book - STILL a good value",Aug 2019,August 2019,Traveled with family,,"Winnetka, Illinois"

Comparing this Aug 15-17, 2019 visit to our previous, definitely a few items was not to guest satisfaction - need to be reminded that ""the little things, attentive service that makes a visit memorable!""  Disatisfaction: 1) upon check-in, FO agent could not find our member account, 2) before guest arrival, housekeeping should do a final inspection of the room, Aug 15th visit, no in room dining menu (called Rm Svc to have a menu delivered), bed deco pillow was found on end table, soap bar from previous guest was found on the floor/foot of bed. 3) No turndown service was provided on 8/16th, in room coffee amenities (cups, condiments) was not replenished.

We were blown away with the view of the sea and the park. The rooms are spacious and the bathroom is fantastic. A separate shower and bath and a heated toilet seat - wow! Everything was just fantastic. Daily water, towels, even a birthday surprise delivered to our room. The pool area is great but a little small for the amount of people staying at the hotel. I would like it if there were some rules for the pool area. Such as people not eating at the infinity pool or guests not jumping into the pool with their clothes on. We ate pool side and the club sandwiches were fantastic. I would highly recommend the Prince. It is away from the crowds in Waikiki which we liked. It is a short walk to Ala Moana mall.

698580221,50,This Hotel Lives up to its High Standards,"I can see why this hotel is rated # 1 on Trip Advisor. From the time that you arrive to the time that you depart, the staff makes you feel welcomed. They remember your name and preferences for example I go to the gym every day and there is always a large bottle of water in my room along with the newspaper at my front door. They always bring ice to my room along with little treats at the nightly turn down service. The Concierge staff is amazing and very helpful with planning activities and structuring your week. They gave me a chart to use so that I can write down my activities. The club room has different selections of food daily and changes the menu for breakfast, lunch and dinner. This is a great way to save money instead of eating out all of the time. Of course, it is always best to visit a Hawaiian restaurant to experience the culture and food on the island. The rooms are clean with floor to ceiling windows and privacy blinds as well as shades that are automatic. Although there is 1 drawer for clothing, it was adequate for me and I also made use of the bottom drawer near the night stand. The closet was great for hanging up clothes plus they give you complimentary slippers and a robe. I recommend staying on the higher floors for a great view.",Aug 2019,August 2019,,The higher floors are best.,

We had booked a Pearl Harbor tour through the concierge months ago and they didn't have the right amount of people on the tour, so we had to go on a different tour. The only positive was that the hotel compensated us for the additional cost. Another issue with the concierge was that we tried to book surfing lessons and they were clueless and gave us incorrect information about the times available. I ended up calling the company directly and booking it. We did like that the hotel is a bit away from the hustle of the main area but still close enough to walk to restaurants and stores.",Aug 2019,June 2019,,,River vale
697978005,50,Guests from Germany,"Excellent and unique in that area:  - Shuttle Service (also to Waikiki Beach, Malls, etc.)  - Very friendly stuff (check in, concierge, room service, house keeping, etc)  - Infinity Pool with view on Harbour side and beaches  - Ocean Front rooms has a really pleasant view  - Perfect quality of food and drinks in the restaurant with good prices  - Live bands in restaurant / bar weekends  - Very good location: Big Mall 10min. Walk, Next beach 3min walk (Stoney beach), more soft beach ca 10 min walk. Bus stations near by    Not so good:  - Bars/Restaurant close 10pm, for sure there is a room service with some choices of food and drinks still available but if you want to have some late night drinks and foods you have to go outside.  - There is a concierge for supporting of activity planning, but with only one provider per activity. Would be great to have more choices for one activity to have better impression of the activity: examples: 3h activity end up with 7h only due to long waiting times. Bus tour had only stops with an entire during of 1 hour to see the plantations and make some photos, but the whole tour was about 8h, so 7h driving, 1h activity at the stops. So more choices I guess would bring more and better decisions for activities specially for people who don’t want to lose time on this great island.

The resort fee and self parking were included in the room night charge. Because we had a rental car, and were out every day, we thoroughly appreciated the self parking option, and it worked well. The hotel location, on the western edge of Waikiki, but just 10 minutes walk to Ala Moana Park and Ala Moana shopping center, was perfect for us, especially for getting away for day trips. Some very minor negatives - an apparent disconnect between our reservation and the front desk upon check in; and the internet is slow to connect, and slow from time to time.",Aug 2019,August 2019,,,"Guam, Mariana Islands"

The beds were queen sized and very inviting. The bathroom was awesome with a separate bath tub, shower and toilet stalls. Oh, and the toilet was a warm seat and it was also a bidet.

The pool area is fantastic and while we were there it was not overly busy so as we were using this as a base for some serious R & R it suited us just fine    The hotel as a wonderful courtesy bus that runs you to many locations around Waikiki    The thing we did do as an additional extra was pay for the club lounge facility on the 5th floor (by the pool) this was $110 per day per room but is open exclusively 0600-2100 & you are entitled to breakfast lunch & dinner snacks. Plus free soft drinks & a small selection of alcohol    Whilst we used the club lounge we were attended to by a couple of fantastic young staff by the names of Janae & Korneillia These girls were friendly kind & ultra professional.

Comfortable beds with great sheets. Robe and slippers included. It was my son's birthday so they brought him a piece of cake with a card. Free water all day. You could take the pool towels to the beach. Handy business center. Free WIFI with great connection. Everything was wonderful from start to finish. They don't have grounds as they are not beachfront but the beach is just a stroll away and I guess that is what makes this hotel so peaceful. We walked by all the other beachfront hotels in Waikiki and their pools and grounds were so so crowded. Very close to the Ala Moana Shopping and to all kind of restaurants and high-end shopping in Ala Moana Boulevard.

Having paid extra for a “club” room we expected something special. Don’t bother with the club. Average service and unless you like sushi with spam, the food isn’t worth it!

We stayed on 8th floor and feel like you'd get better views on higher floors but our view was still fine (overlooking the marina). The room is very very clean, I loved the decor, and the bathroom has a bidet and a clothes line (removable) so you can dry swimsuits. Of note, the toiletries they use are amazing and smell wonderful (I believe they're the Malie brand). The only downside to the room is lack of storage space, so you pretty much have to keep your stuff in suitcases unless you hang it up in the closet.    The location is very convenient. Walking distance to everything in Waikiki and on the beach. Walking distance to the Ala Moana (one of the most incredible malls and the largest outdoor mall in the world) where you have access to a lot of restaurants and even a dedicated Japanese Village for Japanese food fanatics like us.

It is pricey and I'm not sure based on the rooms themselves it is as luxurious or worth the price per se. I would expect a little more in terms of luxury. The shower is separate but a little small and the bathtub is just a standard bathtub. I had a view of the harbor and ocean, which is spectacular. There is a window that opens up and there are no screens so you get a better view of everything. I did find a small cockroach on ceiling the 1st night. Thank goodness for my tall nephew so he could kill it. But after the huge 4 inch spiders on Kona I sucked it up. We didn't find anymore. We had 7 rooms and no one else had any other issues. The rooms were quiet. I didn't hear my kids at all in the next room. We only stayed for 4 nights, but I wish we could have stayed longer. There is a gym, but not that big. The pool is only 3 feet and not that big, but no complaints. They have Happy Hours as well for breakfast and drinks. All in all it was a great stay and I would do it again, price & all.

They lived up to all my expectations and more!. All the pictures posted are very accurate. This is a beautiful hotel with friendly attentive staff. The rooms are bright, spacious, clean and comfortable. The bathroom allows more than enough space with the bathtub, shower and toilet all separated in one large bathroom. The best part is the bidet! There's nothing like feeling fresh and clean after each bathroom break. The rooms are kept clean daily with evening turn down service and they provide 2 bottles of waters, ice and chocolate treats every evening! Don't miss out on the pool. The infinity pool is very small but enjoyable especially in the evening as the sun is setting. They also have a regular pool which is a decent size for the whole family to enjoy with poolside bar service!

691776017,40,Lovely but a stretch to even be 4 star,"As a traveler who has been to dozens of 5 star hotels I can tell you that The Prince falls short of 4 star.  There is no AC in the hallways. Some of the elevators are hot enough to keep buffet food hot. The club lounge has a lovely view but the food choices are meager and mediocre. There are only 2 to 3 choices for breakfast. In fact it is 90 percent less plentiful than even a marriot residence inn.  The bathrooms have one hook. Only one light switch for toilet, vanity, tub shower. So u cannot leave a light on at night.  There is no storage shelf.just a tiny cubby.  In the main room there is only one dresser drawer and an unsafe safe .it is a drawer with a latch. This could be opened with a screw driver.  There is a disorganized check inn process for club level.  Noone explained where to eat breakfast.  How to use wifi since the first wifi option did not work.  No welcome letter. No confirmation of dinner reservation.  The pool is inadequate for the size of the property so in the afternoons everything is full to the max.  There is only one shower for several hundred people with no soap.  There is no sign for club door entry from 5th floor hallway.  The staff are friendly. The hotel is clean and a bit away from the crush of people and tourists and yet accessible.  This is a nice place but the sales pitch and marketing lead one to believe that this is world class. It is no where close.it is a branding of a dated but renovated property with some fancy shower products and some technology.  And yet the morning view of the harbor and sea are lovely.  The reason they wave the resort fee is that it would be outrageous to charge a fee for an over crowded pool with no place to sit.

However, they market the hotel as a “luxury hotel” but are a little lenient with children running wild. They were all over the hot tub, jumping into the pool and splashing everyone.

As a stickler for cleanliness, the hotel met my expectations nicely. It offers many amenities of a high-end hotel. It's not right on Waikiki beach, which turned out to be just fine for us. It was cleaner, not crazy busy and yet exciting, with plenty of action around. Views from the room and 5th floor pool are breathtaking. Service was impeccable all around. Ten minute walk to Ala Moana shopping center is a huge plus. Prices aren't inexpensive, but not ridiculous either, considering this is Honolulu. We did not feel like we were paying for anything thru the roof. Appreciated that there were no additional parking charges. Room size for a family of four with two beds was fine, bathroom super clean, providing privacy with separate doors for shower and the toilet.

The hotel concierge was very helpful in scheduling events/tours that we were interested in. I used the fitness center most mornings, and visited the pool almost every day.

690084184,50,"Out of all the hotels I’ve stayed at on O’ahu, this is THE BEST","There are good reasons why this hotel is consistently chosen as the best place on Trip Advisor to stay at on O’ahu. For me, the location of it being at the edge of Waikiki, more near the Ala Moana side, was why I had chosen it. Definitely didn’t want anything in the heart of Waikiki, as it’s just too congested there, especially when they have those street festivals and traffic is horrendous.    I had the once in a lifetime opportunity of staying here for 7nights during Nov. 2018 with my boyfriend, and we both agreed that it was like a dream staying here and loved this place so much. There was honestly nothing negative we could say about staying here and nothing bad that we had experienced while we were staying here. We were both sad on that last day when we had to say good-bye to our room and we didn’t want our time there to end. This is a feeling that I’m sure is understandably shared by many who had stayed at the Prince Waikiki - you just don’t want to leave.    Everything from the warm and helpful service we received from staff upon check-in, the complimentary bottle of champagne and fresh pineapple plus chocolates that we received, the fruit-infused water at the lobby area to quench your thirst, to the incredibly comfortable bed inside the bright and spacious room, large bathroom with Japanese bidet toilet, and the breathtaking views from the room, were all simply unforgettable. Even the food served at their on-site restaurant is amazing, especially their “Kakuni Pork Benedict” that’s available on their menu for breakfast - you will not regret ordering this!    If you are able to stay here, then by all means, definitely do, it’ll be something to remember positively for a lifetime. I’m originally from HI, had lived there for 20yrs and can attest to the fact that out of all the hotels on the island of O’ahu that I’ve stayed at, this is without any doubts whatsoever, THE BEST one.",Jul 2019,November 2018,Traveled as a couple,,"Mountain View, California"

689589751,40,Almost perfect,"I worked at 3 different hotels in Waikiki (including Hyatt and two Starwood properties) and lived here before for 7 years before moving to mainland. I would say this is among the top 5 of all Hawaii hotels and likely our choice next time, with Kahala being a close competition.    This hotel has very beautiful ocean view rooms, is close to Ala Moana shopping center, and has a great coffee shop on site and a generally attentive staff. The only noticeable drawback was it is not on ocean front, so it's harder than other hotel to access the beach (requires 5-10 minute walk).    But the only reason I am not giving it 5 out of 5 is that during our 8 nights here in first week of June 2019, we had a false fire alarm in the middle of the night that required me to hug my 2 year old down 26 floors of stairs. The front desk staff was very junior and doesn't do much to calm us. Next morning, the staff was still catching up what had happened and offered casual apologies. I didn't complain at checkout as it is not the hotel's fault as there was likely some burning stuff in some floor that wasn't major. But I think the management should definitely acknowledge it and offered some formal apology for the inconvenience (e.g, a letter with a cookie might be enough) or at least the staff should mentioned it at check out.

684828480,50,Absolutely Beautiful And Amazing!!,"This hotel is absolutely amazing. The hospitality was remarkable. We chose this hotel for our 20th Wedding Anniversary and I would definitely stay again. The hotel sent up a complimentary bottle of wine with a custom label (our names, Happy 20th Anniversary) and a card. Everyone was extremely nice from the time you enter the hotel. The view from our room were breathtaking.We only ate at the restaurant during happy hour because they stayed busy. If you go try the salt and Vinegar wings if you are as fan of wings. The pool was amazing and the drinks are very good. This hotel is located one block from the Ala Moana center (mall), with too many stores to count! The hotel does have a shuttle that goes to Ala Moana, Waikiki Beach and a few other stops. Some other places within walking distance are, ABC store for all the things forgotten at home, souvenirs, snacks and many other things! There is a longs drug store at Ala Moana that has cheaper prices. You can also fine Outback, Red Lobster, McDonalds, Buffalo Wild Wings, and Subway are some of the few known food chains we seen within walking distance of the hotel. One of our favorite breakfast spots located near the hotel was Cinnamons...it’s a must if you stay at Prince Waikiki! It’s located within walking distance of the hotel as well. Overall this hotel is amazing and I would definitely stay again.

Popular among Japanese nationals, particularly during the Honolulu Triathlon.    Rooms are spacious with a large TV facing the bed. I love the style - it's a clean, contemporary beach-style with great lighting and I especially love the bathrooms - separate shower, toilet, and bathtub with good lighting. I've stayed at the Prince Waikiki two years running now and have always been impressed with the friendly staff. I think they may have done away with the turndown service :-( Not a full-service resort with endless things to do on-site and the restaurants / food options within the hotel are a little lackluster but the mall is nearby anyways.",Jun 2019,May 2019,Traveled on business,I always stay in the rooms facing the pier / ocean.,"Tokyo Prefecture, Japan"

The views are fantastic and, unlike most other hotel restaurants, Four Sails is very reasonably priced with a bonus amazing view. The rooms are modern and nice but not museum-like (where you're worried about touching anything). The pool is insane though I suppose it'd be nice to have the infinity pool adults only.

She would like to replace the kettle for me but I told her I would like to see the GM before I give it to her. She called GM and waited for her out of my room, later on Assistant hotel manager came to my room, she already knew what happened, and she asked the HSK “Is it our hotel’s Ketle?” WTF! There were two kettles on the desk, a new one just received from the HSK staff, and the disgusting one I had been used for two days! What was the answer she expected from the HSK supervisor? Her face also showed her impatience. She said she will need to investigate and would give me a response in 24 hours, I said I need to get an update before the next afternoon as I will check out and fly to the big island. There was no response until I called her on the following day, she said the only thing she can do was to waive my resort charge.

Wifi in the bedroom is very good and there is a turn-down service in the evening.  The furniture around the pool area is very good with lots to choose from. There are free towels and water to help yourself from, and the area is kept tidy. There is not enough shaded areas around the pool itself so sometimes we sat in the 'club' area. Service around the pool could be improved, as apart from keeping tidy, nothing else is done. We have stayed in hotels whereby towels are laid out for you, and cold waters are brought around. Disappointingly, there is no wifi around the pool area.  The Club area is nice with very good service. There is a small but adequate range of food and drinks.

The on-site sushi restaurant, the only offshoot of a well regarded Tokyo sushi restaurant provides the discerning diner with a fantastic menu, expertly prepared. Really some of the best sushi I’ve had outside of Japan. The main restaurant is known throughout Oahu for its extensive buffet offerings, especially focused on seafood and various Japanese foods. The ala cartel menu, while small, is of sufficient variety to offer options for most dietary needs. The hotel is Japanese owned and so caters not only to various business meetings but to Japanese group tours as well. It’s pool area was pleasant, but those inexperienced with weather on Oahu should know that as the day goes on, the winds out of the east-northeast get stronger and so it can be a little breezy in mid-to-late afternoon.

We’ve stayed here many times and still are amazed at the beautiful view.    It was the first time using the Prince shuttle to and from the Alamoana Shopping center. The valet staff were helpful and courteous as always and the shuttle was easy and gave us ample time at the mall. Pick up and drop off was easy on both ends.    The Prince was quite crowded this weekend with many gatherings at both the restaurants and ballrooms, this the parking lot was full and we had a difficult time finding parking. We drove around for almost an hour trying to find parking as we had dinner reservations that we almost missed.    The staff at the 100 Sails Restaurant were amazing, attentive, quick, and greatly hospitable. From our hostess to our servers...service was wonderful. The only thing that was disturbing was we had an 8:45pm dinner reservation due to the many guests at the hotel the same weekend, we had wished for a earlier reservation, but took it as we were meeting friends for dinner. By 9:30pm the food at the buffet was already being cleared and we felt rushed to eat. We did not realize that the $70/person buffet would be closing so soon after our reservation at 8:45pm. With such a lofty price tag, we had hoped for at least an hour to enjoy the buffet. By 9:45pm most of the hot food was gone, no prime rib, and half of the desserts were gone. We were a party of 5 adults trying to visit with each other as we were on island and have good food, but felt rushed in trying to get to the food before it got taken away. Bummer!    Check out was crowded and trying to figure out where a line was due to the many guest trying to do the same. I don’t mind a wait...but it was difficult to find some kind of line to wait in...the couple behind me also asked me if “this was the line to check out” I stood there kind of floating in space in front of the desks hoping to decipher who could or would help me and others check out. A young man finally did approach me after helping two other groups behind me and asked if I was checking out. He was helpful and apologetic for the wait.

678177235,30,"Expectations were High. Reality, it was okay.","This review is for a leisure trip. I travel a lot for business, so to have a stay for pleasure is such a treat, that I decided to do the ""#1 hotel on Tripadvisor"" in Honolulu. My initial greeting was not the best; I was struggling with 3 bags and no doorman was there to open the door. I looked back and there was one who was slowly walking, but by the time I got into the door, he still wasn't there to open the door.  The front desk was weird too. I stood there for a solid 2-3 minutes before I received any eye contact. One told me to go to the other person, but then other person answered the phone, so then I had to go back to the original person who told me to go to her colleague..  I eventually got checked in and the front desk warmed up and greeted me Happy Birthday. I don't know if they upgraded me, but I did get an Ocean Front Harbor view. Absolutely stunning views! Definitely the one of the two Pros of this hotel- the other was the room was really spacious.  Again, I travel A LOT for work, so I always do a bed check. Shocked to see they didn't invest in a bed bug mattress cover. For being top rated hotel, you think this would be a standard. So sure enough, I saw blood stains on the sheets (see photos). House keeping was made aware and they changed the sheet immediately, but the lady was really unpleasant, the man was very understanding and cheerful.  As for the ""spa"".. they should really advertise it as a room, not a spa. This has nothing to do with the workers, as the workers greeted me so nicely and the masseuse was very good and professional. But for a 4 star hotel, you can't invest on an actual spa? For those thinking of doing a spa treatment, just be aware it's literally in a sleeping room, with a small table outside the door that says it's the ""spa"".

677727748,50,Paradise and 5 star hotel in Oahu,"The Prince Waikiki is an absolutely fantastic Hotel. It’s 5 stars for everything including all the staff, the location, the pool, the rooms, the food and the amazing sunsets. Its a 5 to 10 minute walk to the hustle and bustle of the main part of town but that really suited us as it means the hotel is really peaceful. We upgraded to the club room which we really enjoyed. Many thanks to all the staff in the club room who are all always so helpful especially Ryoko who was always smiling.

677254612,30,Convenient location,"The location was awesome! It close to the airport, pearl harbor, and Ala Moana Center. The room was cozy and clean. I deduct two stars because of the slow check-in process. I booked a total of seven rooms for my families. We checked in on May 19 around 2 pm. The front desk person asked us to write down each person's name and contact information who stay in each room. It's a long wait for doing that. I believe that could be a better way for a large group of people. I booked only one room at a higher level that adds an extra bed, and I still have been asked which room should add a bed. Not sure if the information was not in the system or the front desk person didn't notice that. The bed supposed to be added before we arrived. Besides, two rooms have been checked in before other people arrived. The front desk person provided me the wrong information, saying they only got one room with three people. I corrected her after contacting my cousins and knowing the situation.

The first time we opened the door to our room, I was blown away by the view. The window was floor to ceiling with an electric window shade so that you could get a completely unobstructed view. From the room we could watch surfing, parasailing, boating and swimming. The quality is obvious with marble floors in the bathrooms and floor to ceiling glass in the shower and potty rooms. The toilets have a bidet built in, which is a very nice amenity. The pool deck is awesome with both a standard pool and an infinity pool as well as a bar and a hot tub. Elevators are glass looking street side and were very quick when called for the most part. The restaurant has gorgeous views and frequent live entertainment.

676869822,40,The Infinity Pool is my favorite part,"First, a disclaimer- resort hotels are not really my style. We stayed here as my partner had a conference to attend in this hotel, so it was the easy button.    The hotel caters to Japanese tourists, and even has a very good (I'm told, we didn't eat there) sushi restaurant on site.    We had booked a room with a king bed, but were told they didn't have any left when we checked in and were instead offered a room with 2 queens on a higher floor, ""with a better view"" instead. Ok, fine- but maybe offer me a higher tier room or a dining credit or something if you booked out what we reserved instead of just moving us to a ""higher floor"".    That said, the service at the hotel was impeccable. I spent my mornings and early afternoons out and about, but came back to the hotel around 4pm each day worn out from hiking, diving, etc, showered, and retired to the pool to relax until my partner freed up from ""work"" at the conference and we went back out for the evening.    At the pool, Howard took great care of me (and all the pool guests). Somehow that guy manages to remember the names, room numbers, and favorite drink of everyone he meets. There's nothing like a cold drink brought to you while lounging in the hot tub or the infinity pool after a hard day of sight-seeing :) Thanks Howard!    I was also somewhat surprised that the prices for food/drink at the hotel were not unreasonably jacked up. O'ahu is an expensive place to start with, but I didn't pay that much more for things at the Prince than what I did out and about. That was a nice surprise.    Lastly, the hotel is nicely situated for views over the bay and watching the sunsets.",May 2019,May 2019,Traveled as a couple,,"Falls Church, Virginia"

Rates are reasonable and ever room has a view of the water. The pool area is quite enjoyable. Staff is warm and outgoing as they are always helpful and competent. It is close to everything, yet not in the center of the most frenetic parts of the Waikiki scene. I would recommend it for families and couples alike. Because we often end up on the red-eye flights out of Hawaii we usually ask for late checkouts which have never been denied to us.",May 2019,May 2019,Traveled with family,I always request higher rooms which have outstanding views.,
676556046,40,Relaxing birthday surprise,Prince Waikiki hotel was the best. This hotel has beautiful views from each room as well the lobby is very grand with a coffee shop and gift store. They have a rooftop infinity pool that has great views but would say they need to play the music louder as you can barely hear it. We also had the breakfast buffet which was ok but we suggested that they keep the food warmer as a lot of it was still cold after being cooked.

I cannot fault the way the Hotel Manager Claire approached me in genuinely wanting to correct an error made with my room. It is not often that a business holds themselves with the esteem I was witness to today - well done Prince Waikiki for employing these wonderful people.  The other guests are delightful also (a hint for those wanting to share a resort with a quieter type of traveller). Airline staff use this hotel as their preferred lay over hotel - that to me is a clue that I was on to a good thing when booking at the Prince.  It's not a far walk into the crazy part of Waikiki, I am rather pleased that the hotel isn't in the thick of the hustle and bustle.

674126285,40,Great stay!,"We stayed here in May for a combined conference/ holiday for 9 nights. Our room was on the 26th floor facing the Ala Moana and the view was beautiful, overlooking the marina and the sunsets were truly spectacular. A bit noisy overnight, but well blocked if you close the window. I loved the fact that we could open the windows which we did constantly. A word of warning..... you cannot turn the air conditioning on when the windows are open, even a small amount. I didn’t realise my window was open when I called housekeeping to help me out, and they explained this fact. Our bed was remarkably comfortable and large++!  The choice of TV channels was poor. Had ongoing problems with wifi dropping out on my devices constantly, but otherwise fairly good connection. One teabag per day quota stingy.  The swimming pool and surrounding area was terrific and I was able to do a few laps in the infinity pool each day. I would not, however, like to have my room overlooking the pool. It was accessible at all hours, and could be quite busy at night. People can be rather inconsiderate!  Overall, we had a great stay. It was convenient to the Convention centre along the canal and the Ala Moana, and although a decent walk to the main hub of Waikiki, it was a pleasant stroll during the balmy evenings. We certainly walked a lot over our stay. If you don’t want to walk, there is a terrific shuttle bus service from the hotel to the Ala Moana and Waikiki shops so the distance doesn’t have to be an impediment.  I would recommend the hotel to anyone who asks.

Had to search for spa information. Didn’t know about happy hour, drink packages, etc...Went to the front desk SEVERAL times asking questions and when my husband asked about the drink package that someone on the pool deck had mentioned not a single person working the lobby had any idea what he was talking about and had to pull up the information in their website!

672899313,50,Excellent experience,"We just got back from Oahu Island and stayed at Prince Waikiki for 4 nights. I had a fairly high expectation of Prince Waikiki after reading other reviews and having done my research, the hotel not only met my expectation but in fact exceeded it.    The hotel is modern and warm, above all else it's the service that has left the strongest impression with me and my family. The staff were very friendly and helpful.    Prince Waikiki is in a slightly exclusive corner of Waikiki and I like the quiet neighbourhood. 5-7 minutes' walk away is the Hilton, which is a large resort and the main Waikiki beach. Hilton is probably a good fit for many travellers as there're lots of ongoing activities and restaurants. We enjoy walking through it as we head to the beach but it's not for us, I'd much prefer a less crowded and quiet hotel.    I chose to stay at another hotel for 2 nights after Prince Waikiki just to experience a different set up. Prince Waikiki was better.

672895579,50,Excellent Choice for Staying Near Waikiki,"My wife and I wanted something near Waikiki, but our primary reason for being in Honolulu was to see the Pearl Harbor memorial and related things. The Prince Waikiki turned out to be a great choice. The room had a view of the ocean, the parking garage is not huge but allowed us to avoid any delays from a valet service, and the staff were friendly. (The fellow at the concierge desk deserves a special thumbs up for his suggestions, especially the Vietnamese restaurant.)

It’s great if you want to shop and dine out and party but I can travel much closer and for far less money to great cities to get that. I love cities but when I think Hawaii, I think beach. I’ve been to Waikiki twice before and frankly couldn’t wait to leave. After staying at the PW, I can’t wait to go back!!!    After looking at pictures online I was looking forward to seeing the infinity pool and checking out the boats in the bay but what I was not expecting was the room and view. I was blown away by the floor to ceiling windows. The view was incredible and the windows even opened!! PICTURES DO NOT DO IT JUSTICE. Watching the sun rise and then set from bed with a cup of coffee was a special treat. The room, though on the smaller side had high ceilings and a really open feeling. It was elegant but not stuffy and left me thinking, “this is really all the space you need!” The pool was beautiful as shown on the website and when I went, was not packed. Finding a chair was easy. There are restaurants on site and many in walking distance so no worries there. The beach is also just a short walk away. There are two beach options. The closer of the two is in front of the Hilton Hawaiian Village. It’s fairly crowded but great for people watching and enjoying the ocean.

670981536,50,The best in Waikiki!!,"Not even sure where to begin....  My family of 4 stayed here during our spring break for 6 nights. I purchased a vacation thru Costco and let me tell you, it was definitely worth it!  I paid extra to be upgraded to the Oceanfront Premier Room, which meant a higher floor. Our package included the daily buffet breakfast, day use of a pool cabana (which included a 12 in pizza, 4 bottled waters, sunscreen and 2 cocktail-sooo worth it!) and a 20% discount when dining at 100 Sails Restaurant for breakfast, lunch and dinner. (We took advantage of it when we dined during the seafood buffet dinner.)    We were on the 30th floor and the views were soooooo breathtaking! Our room had 2 queens. At first it seemed on the small side, but was fine as the days went on. We were only there to sleep and take a break from the beach/pool. The ONLY hiccup we had during our stay was that we had to change rooms after the first night. It was probably my fault as I should have mentioned I was a light sleeper and didn't want to be near the elevator. Well, when the elevator doors opened, our room was right in front of it! I thought it wouldn't have been an issue but at 3:30 in the morning I could hear the elevator. We managed to switch rooms the next morning to a room on the same floor. Easy peasy! (I didn't unpack just in case.)    The bathroom was large with a seperate shower, tub and toilet. The toilet ""room"" even had a bidet!!! I never knew how much I would miss it until I went home. hahaha. Housekeeping did an awesome job cleaning our room during our stay. We had all the comforts of home and I loved that we were away from the business of Waikiki. We were able to take advantage of the shuttle but one of the days it wasn't running because of SpamJam, which had the main streets of Waikiki closed so traffic was horrendous-our Lyft driver didn't even pick us up because of traffic.    We took advantage of the daily buffet breakfast at least 4 of the days we were there. It was so helpful especially on the days when we had an early morning start before the beach or a hike.    The pool was lovely!!I loved the infinity pool, which made for great photos. It was never really loud or had too many kids. It was definitely a place for us to relax.    We had a car rental for 3 days and liked the fact that parking was already included in the hotel stay. The only thing not included was a $31.41 daily resort fee, which is fine since most hotels are charging that now.    Everyone we came into contact with at the hotel was always welcoming/helpful and always had a smile. I can see why this hotel is rated #1.

Our stay from start to finish was flawless, effortless and entirely enjoyable, what a great hotel! The staff we experienced throughout the entire hotel were wonderful, lovely and so very helpful, they were a pleasure to deal with on a daily basis. We spent plenty of time by the pools and in the club. I chose to book the club as it includes free food and drinks pretty much all day, i think it was 6am until 9pm, so you can have a light meal there, a snack or a drink and it doesn't cost you anything additional. The club is also right by the pool so you can watch the kids in the pool whilst you relax. The room was lovely, modern, lovely bathroom with seperate toilet, seperate shower and bath and plenty of space. The opening windows for fresh air were spot on and the ocean and sunset views were a pleasure to wake up to and enjoy every day. Beds were very comfortable, turn down service a lovely touch. It was a short distance from the main drag of waikiki however it was only a 15 minute walk or a $7 cab ride and this was no bother for us.

When we first arrived, the host was really cordial and wished us congratulations since we mentioned in our booking that it was a honeymoon trip and also for my wife’s birthday. When we got to to the room, we were elated to find a bottle of Prosecco in the fridge with a customized label saying congratulations to my wife and me. On top of that, they gave a slice of birthday cake for my wife (see picture). So much Aloha!    The views from the room were amazing too, so if we were too lazy to get out, we could still see a beautiful sunset (see picture).    Overall, this was the best service we’d had a hotel, from the hosts, to the complimentary breakfast (tons of variety and worth eating everyday of our stay) and the highly attentive waiters/waitresses, to the pool staff who brought our pizza and mixed drinks right to our seats next to the infinity pool, and to the room service staff who were very courteous as we passed them in the hallways. Even the maintenance staff was really friendly, leaving a nice note in our room after fixing a small leak.    Definitely recommend this place for future stays.

The service is incredible, the rooms are amazingly clean, the pool is unbelievable (with a bar right next to it serving you drinks while in it!), and overall the hotel is just the definition of what I want when I want to stay in a great hotel in a great place.    The service is always with a smile! I am a local, and I really appreciate the entire staff's positive attitude and their passion for what they do. You are always their top priority no matter what, and it really shows in the quality of their service to you.    The rooms are impeccably clean. The bathrooms have amazingly deep tubs, great showers, the views are amazing, and they are always spotless. The rooms have large wall-sized windows that you can open up to let the island breeze pour into the room. Overall, the rooms are always top-notch!    The pool is my favorite part of this hotel. There is a hot tub, a normal pool, and then an infiniti pool. All of this is on the fifth floor of the hotel, so you are overlooking the nearby Ala Wai harbor and its million-dollar yachts and sailboats going in and out. You can see up and down the O'ahu coast, an amazing skyline, and amazing sunsets right from the pool. To add to that, there is a bar right next to the pool that will bring you drinks so that you never have to get out of the water once for anything!

Prince hotel is a hotel where we checked out and said wow, wish we could have stayed here earlier! The hospitality is top notch - very Japanese.    The hotel was renovated recently so everything is very clean and modern. I didn’t know this prior to booking but one of the front men advised us!    There is a little store in the lobby to buy small drinks. We were checked in by a lady named pammie - She was so lovely, so detailed and hospitable! They gave us an earlier check in as we had a baby.  The rooms are very spacious! And housekeeping even address you by your surname. Amazing. Very personable!    What I love about this hotel is all the toiletries is brought up to u without having to ask which was a hit and miss in Hawaii!  The 100 sails restaurant was great!!! The hotel had made us a reservation on late notice and they still accomodated us to a table w fire works view!!!!    Pool was awesome. Beautiful view of the 1000 sails - literally!    There is a shuttle bus to ala Moana and a few other stops but it’s not really in walking distance to the main strip!!!!

663722159,50,Nice hotel in good location,"We arrived after midnight following a marathon 26 hour journey from Scotland - check in was quick and efficient, and we were soon in our room settling in for our 2 week stay.    Room (3216) was very nice with large windows looking out over the marina. Bed very comfortable and ample storage space in room. Bathroom also well equipped with shower and separate tub, and good quality toiletries.    We had opted for the Club set up (rooms are on the top 3 floors) - breakfast was OK, however, we preferred eating out, so only had the breakfast a few of the mornings. We found the Club Lounge a nice place to relax occasionally during the day, particularly if the pool area was too busy. We also enjoyed the free wine in the evenings - quality was acceptable, and the staff in the Club Lounge were very friendly (especially Marley). Snacks were OK, but unlike in other Club Lounges we have used, you couldn't really use these as your evening meal.    Only real complaint was that housekeeping was a bit hit and miss - we had to phone down a few times as our room seemed to have been missed - this was a bit puzzling as some of the days we were missed we actually saw the cleaner in the room next door. Wasn't a huge problem as usually got there in the end - just a bit of a minor irritant.    We had stayed across the road at the Equus on a previous visit to Honolulu (7 years ago), so quite like this area. 10 minutes walk along to the Ala Moana Shopping Centre, where there are many shops as well as bars / restaurants.    In the opposite direction, it took us around half an hour to walk along to Waikiki Beach, either along the beach itself or following the road.

663625092,30,Hit and Miss,"Hubs brought me to the Prince to celebrate my birthday this week, and while I want to love it (sentimentality), honest compels me to say it’s hit and miss.    Pros: good location for walking around Waikiki - easy walk to restaurants, the mall, and obviously the harbor. The infinity pool on the 5th floor is beautiful and there are many fewer young kids running around than when we stayed at a larger, resort-style hotel on the big island. The deal they are running now, we got the 7th night free plus free parking. The people are very friendly and want to help. The affiliated golf course is a lot of fun (hubby played 27 holes). The massages that we got from Naio Bliss (Lomi lomi) we’re extremely relaxing. There’s a convenient shop downstairs with resort reasonable prices (deodorant, which hubs forgot, was only $4) and there’s a Honolulu Coffee which makes a darn good americano. There is nightly turndown, during which you get a tasty chocolate plus two free bottles of water. They also have free WiFi.    Cons: Restaurant (100 Seas) is just meh. They advertise a golf course, but it’s 35+ minutes off site, not at the hotel. The shuttle to said golf course only runs twice a day. While its waterfront, it is not beachfront - you either have to walk to the Hilton or to the public beach - both about a quarter of a mile give or take. The infinity pool, while beautiful, is tiny. There is no spa onsite (they offer massages but that’s basically it, and you do it either near the pool in a cabana or in a vacant hotel room).    Perhaps most annoying, our lock just stopped working on our third night here. We were on our way home from a dive, desperately wanting a shower, and we had to wait about 30 minutes for them to bring up engineering and troubleshoot our door. They were very apologetic about it... but that’s basically it. No offers to make it right otherwise, nothing.",Apr 2019,April 2019,Traveled as a couple,,"Oakland, California"
663544057,10,Worse Hawai’i hotel we ever stayed at,"How did they earn five stars on TripAdvisor? This is our first and last time staying on this end of Waikiki. We only stayed here because of Costco special. “Free” airport transfer meant being herded into a cattle car so every seat was filled. We thankfully were first drop off out of six stops. But we still had to follow the one family who needed to go to baggage claim to get luggage. Check in was okay, but nothing completely explained which you don’t realize until you are in the moment..like where the restaurant for free breakfast buffet included in our package is. Food not great. Omelette station good and the Japanese style breakfast okay. She told us third floor but did not mention you cannot get to the third floor by the hotel elevator. You have to go back down to lobby, then you have to take an escalator from the lobby to the restaurant or up one level to a different set of elevators. Our welcome package including free bottles of water were not in our room. After second day of still not receiving, we called housekeeping who then delivered, but they realized they forgot to deliver to all guests and were suddenly knocking on doors to deliver bags. We ended up with two. 😜 Hotel needs to work on customer service which is hit or miss here. Housekeeping clearly needs a lot of help learning how to properly clean rooms. They need to realize people pay a lot of money to stay here and should be more understanding and apologetic when the guest finds out she is allergic to all their toiletries and has to go out hunting for these things in the dark after traveling all day with bad directions of how to get to the store by housekeeping and the front desk...with no apology. The only friendly service was the guys at the front door. Service at Front desk, restaurant, shuttle inconsistent. Housekeeping of room, on phone and encounters in hallway all bad..because they only have ice on floors 9, 19, and 28. Don’t imply I’m there for ill-intent when I’m holding a room card and an ice bucket and your cart is blocking the door to the ice machine.

661251457,30,Underwhelmed and don't believe this hotel lived up to expectations,"We stayed at The Prince, Waikiki for 3 nights, and were really disappointed with a number of aspects of this hotel, notwithstanding most all the staff were very friendly and courteous. The hotel is relatively new, ideally located with well appointed rooms, great ocean & marina views, and has the potential to be much better. Our issues with this hotel relate to (a) we booked an ocean view room with a king bed, but were allocated a room with 2 x queen beds; (b) their internet service; and (c) our dining experience. We did not have internet access on day 1 of our stay, and after that we continued to experience intermittent issues/delays (which made it difficult communicating with family & business in Australia), and then on our last night, the television system failed. As for our dining experience, on our first night we arrived at the in-house restaurant at ~6:00pm, and was told no tables would be available until 8:30pm, so we decided to dine casually at the bar (where the service was very good). However, we noticed >15 tables (x4) were empty/vacant, and even when we finished up at 8:15pm, there was still ~12 tables (x4) empty/vacant, so we don't understand why we couldn't have dined in the restaurant, because, after all, it was a buffet (USD$65 per head), and didn't require wait staff. Additionally, we do prefer to eat healthy, and when we went to breakfast in the morning, we always have cereal and fruit, but the only cereal on offer was Fruit Loops and Frosted Flakes, and when we asked if there was any other more healthy options (eg. granola) we were informed that there was no other cereal on offer. As aforementioned, most all the staff were very friendly, but this hotel just didn't measure up to expectations.",Mar 2019,March 2019,Traveled as a couple,Ocean/Marina Views are excellent.,"Sydney, Australia"

Upon arrival, the hotel provided a delicious pineapple (the first night) and water bottles for each day.

660555927,50,Great location and delicious restaurant,"10 minute walk to beach, 15 minute walk to the Ala Moana mall (biggest mall), great view of Waikiki beach I recommend upgrading to “ocean view room” because it’s so worth seeing the yachts along with looking out to Waikiki beach and the city from a high point of view, I trust you won’t regret it. The bathroom stuff provided such as the shampoo, conditioner, soap, etc are very nice and doesn’t feel “cheap” like other hotels. They don’t make my skin or hair feeling dry. The bathroom is also clean and I like how the toilet and shower have their own litttle room and not together, good idea. The pool is beautiful! You’ll get a fantastic view while chilling in the pool. Overall, I love this hotel I even like their cute, little gift shop filled with eye-catching souvenirs like the pineapple section.

Location on the perimeter of town was ideal and you could still walk to beaches. We probably stopped at the concierge desk once a day and always received helpful tips.

A little higher would have been better. All rooms except the lanai suite have no balcony but windows open wide for a nice ocean breeze. The only reason I did not give four stars was our coffee maker had no carafe, cups or coffee included in our room fee for morning coffee. Also, because the furniture is built in and cannot be easily replaced, ours was stained and dingy. The white bed cover was also not completely clean.

It has a great pool area and a convenient Honolulu Coffee company in the lobby that opens at 5:30am for early birds. The staff is exceptional. All front desk personnel were caring and helpful. In the past I've stayed at The Modern in Waikiki and in the last year find they are not as good. The Modern Hotel front desk doesn't even check the computer if you ask for a reasonable late check out. It's automatically denied. At the Prince, they were gracious and gave me two extra hours because they could accommodate it. The Modern also didn't get my Hawaiian Air points in despite having them on file and then wouldn't do it when it didn't appear on my Hawaiian Air statement.

655704736,40,Very nice hotel; restaurant/bar unacceptable,"We had a good two night stay at the Prince Waikiki, an oceanfront (but not beachfront) hotel at the edge of Waikiki Beach. Rooms were spacious, spotless and nicely decorated, with comfortable beds and good linens. There are no balconies, but a wall of windows overlooked the yacht harbor, so our room had lovely views. Bathroom was fine.  We liked the location, just at the edge of Waikiki: an easy (10-20 minute) walk to Waikiki beach and all the big hotels, but in a quiet, tranquil location. The pool area was very attractive.    There is, however, a big negative to this hotel. For a large hotel, the food options are surprisingly limited and very much below par. There is a coffee bar in the huge lobby; a small sushi restaurant on the lobby level that seemed popular; and 100 Sails, the main option, located up several levels from the lobby, on the events floor. 100 Sails is a sprawling space with no real decor or ambiance and terrible lighting, resembling a hastily repurposed events hall. The night we were there, it featured an all-you-can-eat buffet, with the only other option being a limited and unappealing menu. The items we ordered were pretty bad, including a tasteless Caesar Salad (a hard dish to ruin). There are few good dining options within a block or two of the Prince, so having a decent place to eat is even more important.  We were surprised that the only bar was the one in the middle of 100 Sails-- a brightly lit, unpleasant space. During the day, there is a bar outside in the pool area, but that closed early.  Also, given the lack of balconies in the rooms, having a relaxing outdoor restaurant would be a great addition.

Initially, we were placed in a room that overlooked the harbour and Ala Moana Blvd. I had booked an “Ocean Premier” to ensure we didn’t have a room like this so I called down to the front desk and they were very understanding, and immediately found us a room with a clear ocean view. It was outstanding to have the windows open 24/7 and open our eyes each morning to brilliant sunrises through the floor to ceiling, wall to wall windows. Hearing the ocean was a relaxing way to fall asleep after a busy day.    Everyone at the hotel was fabulous and friendly. Housekeeping came by every day at the same time and did a great job as well. Bell desk always very helpful and had a lot of info about dining and things to to do.    We had a vehicle so took advantage of the free parking with the resort fee. Finding a spot was almost never an issue, except the weekend.    The location is right next to the HHV lagoon so it’s at a quiet end of Waikiki that allows access to the beaches (plus 2 lagoons and plenty of water sports). Also had a spectacular, uncrowded view of the fireworks on Friday on the pool deck with a drink in hand while listening to a local artist play at the poolside lounge. Amazing evening!    Within walking distance of Ala Moana Mall for tons of shopping and eating options. Many other food options in the area (Goofy’s was our favourite breakfast spot). I ordered pizza from room service one night-it had to have been a frozen pizza warmed up because the middle was cool and the cheese barely melted. Very disappointed as could have ordered take out through the meal delivery service in Waikiki but wanted to make it easy. Will know for next time.    We walked and never felt unsafe, although there are a few tents, the people keep to themselves. There was one morning around 3 am that I was awake, and heard people below (we had the window open the entire stay). I looked out to see two guys going vehicle to vehicle testing door handles. Keep doors locked and nothing in them to avoid being a victim of theft.    This hotel truly made us feel like we were on a holiday from the moment we pulled up until the moment we drove away. When we return to Waikiki, we’ll be sure to stay with them again!",Feb 2019,February 2019,Traveled with family,,saskatoon
655279169,50,Best Waikiki Hotel,"This was our first time staying that the Prince Waikiki and we have stayed at many. Waikiki has become crowded and heavy with traffic in the past decade with parking being a huge challenge as well. We tried the Price this time around and it was so easy to get into and out of. There was not a huge influx of people as you se in the other nearby hotels and every single employee that we came across was extremely friendly. We never felt rushed to leave, like we are at other hotels (by housekeeping) and it felt like a true Hawaiian vacation; laid back and slow-paced.

654834662,50,Anniversary Fun Night,"I surprised my wife of 17 with an overnight stay at The Prince Hawaii Hotel in Waikiki. We've eaten at the buffet restaurant but never stayed there. Must be too expensive and lots of Japanese visitors there from what we knew. I wanted a nice hotel room with a great view of the sunset. She was definitely surprised, and the surprise was even better with so many little ""extras"". Parking was self park and payment came with the room.... awesome. Check-in was very fast and the desk person was do friendly. She explained the room type we got. The view was incredible seeing the full Oceanside from Diamond Head to Ewa. Even the harbor below was gorgeous. King size bed was great and the bathroom blew my wife away. Shower big enough for both of us was an unexpected surprise as was the very nice welcome and thank you card from the GM. Included in the stay was also a small discount for the buffet lunch just before check-out...NICE! We were also given 2 coupons for free coffees at the coffee Cafe in the lobby. That was the icing on the cake. It had to one of the best anniversary surprises I've done. The hotel was so beautiful as expected, clean as expected, service was also 5 Star as expected. I especially like that it isn't located deep into Waikiki where traffic is a hassle. All in all great stay.

654675982,50,"Newer, Cleaner, Tidier, Bigger: Only-Ocean-View-Only-Rooms Hotel","How do you write a review about the best hotel near Alamoana Center and the entrance to Waikiki when it is all been said in a variety of tones; full of gratitude.    This was my third stay at Prince Waikiki (Hawaii Prince Hotel) and I continue to stay here on my annual January trip to the 50th State.    For starters, you can stay closer to Alamoana Center for a similar rate but your room will not be as new, cleaner, tidier, bigger. And to top it off you won’t get an ocean view because Prince Waikiki is an “only-ocean-view” hotel.    I feel really welcomed here as soon as I arrive. I don’t feel like I’m being hustled or smothered with good service for a tip by the doormen. I feel like that at other hotels in Honolulu in the past.    Because they could not build it in the middle of Alamoana Center, this is the ideal location to walk off your meal back to Prince Waikiki to rest and you can always walk back for more shopping and eats so that you do not cramp it all in one day.    The block Prince Waikiki is in has affordable franchise eateries as well as popular island restaurants that you will like to include in your list of places to dine. However, you do not have to go far in the hotel to enjoy 100 Sails Restaurant and Bar. I loved that you can have a quick cheap bite at the bar or take your time to the excellent island cuisine in the restaurant. I love Japanese food, too. I always have at least one meal at Katsumidori on the lobby floor.    In sharing why I enjoy Prince Waikiki, I want say that it allows me to take my time to walk anything off and, more importantly, it makes it possible to spend time in the sun; longer than the usual carpark to mall front entrance that I am used to. I refused to rely on a car while in Honolulu. I am not in a hurry. I enjoy catching the bus when needed for only $2.50 per trip. This is the reason I am on vacation; to break the monotony of what I have been doing the past 12 months.    I love Prince Waikiki. I swim and go to the gym twice a day the whole week I am there. I enjoy the nice walk into the rest of Waikiki to people-watch near the crowds of Kalakaua Boulevard hotels and drop-in for a bite or beverage.    But, my enjoyment of Prince Waikiki truly includes the nice, take-my-time walk to go past Alamoana Center to Walmart, Sam’s Club, Don Quixote and my catholic church (yes, I include Mass during my vacation).    Prince Waikiki is for me and you will agree when you stay there. I always put a few dollars on my pillow to say thank you to the housekeeper for taking care of my room daily. Yes, it is their job; but in Hawaii, ohana means family. Family means no one gets left behind. Just ask Lilo and Stitch. They’re from Alohaland.",Feb 2019,January 2019,Traveled solo,Lower numbers on your floor is closer to the elevator,"Apia, Samoa"

Regardless every room has an ocean view. The staff is friendly and courteous. You can easily walk to Kahanamoku Beach and all the way to Waikiki Beach or go in the opposite direction and hit up Ala Moana Beach. Get out of the sun for a while getting lost in Ala Moana Shopping Center and take back goodies from the poke bar at Foodland to put in your fridge for a quick snack. The two in-house restaurants are both excellent, although the last time I had the buffet in 2018 I felt the food quality had gone downhill slightly.

The hotel sparkles. It is clean, service is excellent and friendly at all levels. It has all of the comforts one would expect. The rooms are spacious and it seems that all have views of either the beach or Ala Moana harbor. The room had a fridge (empty, and no mini bar), drinking glasses (but only one paper coffee cup that was never replaced), coffee maker and hot pot. Amenities included soaps, shampoos, lotions by Malie, which had a nice soft tropical smell. Beds were comfortable and light fixtures and AC worked well (no calls to the front desk were needed!). Toilets are those Japanese toilets with built in bidets. The pools are on the 5th floor and overlook the beach and makes for nice sunset viewing. There is an adjacent bar. There are two restaurants--100 Sails, which is apparently a popular buffet for local and a Japanese sushi restaurant. There also a casual coffee shop and gift shops on the first floor. The location is convenient to the convention center and Ala Moana shopping center, although pedestrian access to both places is strange with the way the traffic lights and crosswalks are set up. Ala Moana beach and harbor are just a few yards away. Ala Moana beach is less crowded than Waikiki and great for families. Down sides are that the pool is located away from any beach (minor) and aside from the shopping center, the shops in the area are generally uninspiring (McD's, ABC store, Crazy Shirt and a few steak and chain restaurants).",Feb 2019,February 2019,Traveled on business,better views on the higher floors but all rooms seem to have a view of the ocean or harbor,"San Francisco, California"

The restaurant doesn't feel like it has been updated in the same way the rooms, pool and overall property have been. It seems like more of a cafeteria with no open air environment. It felt out of place in such a nice property.",Jan 2019,January 2019,Traveled as a couple,,"Kailua-Kona, Hawaii"

648158972,50,Beautiful Waikiki Destination,"I read the reviews and thought about location and comparison to others in this price point and took the plunge on the Prince. Boy am I glad I did. Ideal location at the edge of Waikiki with self-parking and no issues finding a spot. Amazing views from Ocean Front rooms of the Waikiki Yacht Club and the edge of Waikiki beach. Walking distance to Ala Moana Beach park and the mall. Easy in and out of Waikiki. They also have a shuttle which we did not use because we rented a car.The rooms are a very nice size, with soft, calming appointments. Beds are terrific. Service is great, including nightly turn downs with chocolate on your pillow.The 5th Floor infinity pool is to die for.Great rec center with clean equipment.Nice coffee spot in the lobby for decent morning joe and a snack.We also took advantage of the Prince Express breakfast in the dining room ($8 omelets). The breakfast buffet was deluxe, with eggs, fruit, Japanese breakfast items, fish, etc.All in all, a great spot, especially for adults or families with older children. The beach is not right outside but that makes for a much quieter location.We did not choose the Prince Club but I checked out the amenities. They have food all day, with quite decent breakfast and lunch options.

It does not have a beach view per se - at least from our vantage point, but all rooms face the ocean which is nice. We walked to the West to the beaches opposite Ala Moana which were far less busy (on weekdays), with beautiful sand and a nice reef.  We were not particularly impressed with the food at the pool, or the pool service, but the pool itself, with its infinity edge on the 5th floor is pretty awesome. That said, it was almost always breezy on the pool deck, which seemed to be a function of the building design that funneled any breath of wind across the deck.

646443635,50,The Best Hotel in Waikiki,"I have stayed at Prince Waikiki every single time I come to Oahu, and trust me, this hotel never disappoints. I feel comfortable and welcomed by all of the staff members at this resort. When you step out of your car, the workers happily smile and welcome you, already starting off your vacation on the right foot. If you really want to experience Oahu in the best possible way, you should stay at Prince Waikiki.    This was my first time going to Oahu in December, and I could not have picked a better month because the weather was absolutely perfect! Not too hot and not too cold, which is just the way I like it. On top of perfect weather, I could not have picked a better resort to stay at during this time. They had beautiful Christmas decorations at this time of year, with an outstanding Christmas tree right in front of the entrance.    The rooms at Prince Waikiki are perfectly nice and cozy. If you want luxury at a reasonable price, this is the hotel to stay at. The beautiful ocean view rooms give you a wide window that you can open to see a one of a kind view. Peaceful and blissful, those are the two perfect words to describe the view and experience. On top of that, Prince Waikiki is set at a great location; walking distance to the Alo Moana center.    Prince Waikiki also has a well known restaurant right inside of the hotel: 100 Sails. So technically saying breakfast, lunch, and dinner are available within steps of where you're staying. On weekends, they offer a delicious brunch and buffet menu. On the first floor, they also have an outstanding sushi restaurant named, Katsumidori, with some of the best tuna I've ever had. You can also find a coffee and acai bar, as long with a convenience store right on the first floor.    My favorite part about Prince Waikiki, has got to be the pool area. They have an epic infinity pool, that looks even better during sunset. Cabanas are available for reservations and you can even enjoy your lunch or dinner in the pool section as well. The pool area is sheek and comfortable.    In conclusion, if you are looking for luxury, peacefulness and convenience at a reasonable price, Prince Waikiki is the perfect hotel to stay at. Trust me, you will not be disappointed with your choice and will leave Prince Waikiki wishing that you never left. When I think of Oahu, I think of Prince Waikiki and how I can't wait to stay at the resort again.",Jan 2019,December 2018,Traveled with friends,Ocean view rooms are amazing,"San Diego, California"

Really pretty and large size rooms plus a lot of extra touches (turned down service, welcome drinks, New Years treat). It's about a 20 minute walk to the main downtown of Waikiki and about 10 minutes from the Ala Moana. It's nice to be a bit removed from the craziness of downtown Waikiki. Great views as well from the hotel and we didn't miss being right on the beach especially with the wonderful pool.

We purchased the executive lounge option and it didn't disappoint. My 20-something kids loved the beer and wine on tap all day! Food was delicious--loved the fresh fruit and salad throughout the day.

The building itself is quiet and we seldom if ever can here the people or TV in the adjacent room. The heated infinity pool is warm and relaxing, even in January. The bathrooms are huge and include a toilet with a heated seat and bidet. The free shuttle bus make 10 trips daily to the Ala Moana Mall, the Duke Kahanamoku statue on Waikiki Beach and two other locations. We enjoyed the Breakfast Express at 100 Sails and the Honolulu Coffee shop in the lobby. There are also several restaurants near by. You won’t be disappointed with this hotel.

We paid the extra to be able to access the concierge club on the 5th floor by the pool and it was definitely worth it. The staff there was amazing, the food was lovely and the lounge and outdoor area were elegant. They had beer and wine on tap, and plenty of other beverages and waters to choose from.  We loved being a little tiny bit off the beaten path but close to everything. The hotel is quiet and calm and the pool never got crazy.

Our flight from Tokyo arrived at 8 am and they graciously let us check in before 10 am that day. On the day of departure our flight was at 5:25 pm and they were nice enough to give us a late check out of 3 pm. I have no loyalty status with this property and so this generosity was even more gracious!    Located at the western end of Waikiki its also very easy to get in and out of this hotel. The attached parking garage is very convenient with easy in and out. The Prince has one of the best pool areas in Waikiki as well with a secondary small infinity pool. May be the pool at the Sheraton Waikiki is nicer and bigger but the service at the Prince more than makes up for it.    The rooms are all refurbished, modern and tastefully decorated with floor to ceiling windows. Finally the wifi is also quite fast.

643175163,50,Phenomenal hotel stay -- one of the best!,"This hotel stay was one of the top stays I have ever encountered, and I travel approximately 100 days / 365 each year. From check-in onwards, the service was friendly, sincere, and flawless -- and this surprised me given that I was there at peak season, when hotel are at capacity and the likelihood of errors increases. Staff were always willing to help with a friendly Aloha and offer their expertise and advice.    The room was spotless, updated, and had a perfect view of the marina. It was also bigger than expected, which was a nice surprise. The bathroom also had lots of space and modern features. My favourite -- and another super surprise -- was the Japanese toilet! This genuinely improved my well-being. If you've ever experienced a Japanese toilet, you will understand! :D    The location is slightly off ""the strip"" but this can be viewed as a either a bonus or a detriment, depending on your perspective. Being a bit further away from the main drag (ie. where the Moana Surfrider or Duke's statue is) means it's quieter, and also easier to get into the CBD if you are into art galleries, museums, and trendy restaurants like I am. However, it could also mean you're feeling a bit of FOMO if you're into the stereotypical Waikiki activity vibe, as once you hit the strip, you realize it is pretty crazy busy down there. Personally, maybe if i was visiting at a less busy time of year, I would prefer to be on the strip, but at peak holiday season, being a bit farther out was a benefit for me. It's a 25-30 min walk to that main drag, but the hotel's shuttle also is convenient (though I do wish it ran more often and later -- I ended up relying on Uber several times to get back).    Overall, I have a hard time saying anything negative about this hotel. I struggle to think about staying anywhere else if I return to Waikiki! I'd like to suggest the designers put one more hanging hook in the bathroom -- given that you're likely to spend a lot of time at the beach and pool (which is also thumbs up btw) -- it would be great to have more space to hang damp towels and swimmers. On a related note, I'd like to suggest that the hot tub and infinity pool be adults-only... I was not happy about the splashing 5 year olds in both spaces. :(    Other than those small things, I don't hesitate to highly recommend this hotel.

The price is appropriate for the quality of the service.The only negative point is the noise we could hear during the night (from the street outside and also from the neighboring room). Maybe we just had bad luck with our room and the very noisy neighbors.

The staff from Door Man to Check-in to Concierge to Club hostesses are all friendly, smiling and helpful. We stayed at the Club room and it was quiet, roomy and well appointed. The best is the ocean front view with the most amazing sunset view. My wife really loves the blackout shade and the comfortable bed so she really enjoy a good night sleep every night. Bathroom was huge and full of nice amenities, particularly the heated toilet seat which my wife loves. As for the Club Lounge, the food quality is excellent and the drinks, including wine and beer, are plentiful. We found the lounge very relaxing as food and drinks are available from morning to late evening which really fit our mode of relaxed vacation. We tried the 100 Sails restaurant and food was also very good. We didn't tried the Japanese restaurant but it must be good as there are always lines waiting for dinner every night. The other good thing is the shuttle to Ala Moana Shopping Center and Waikiki which is helpful after a long walk in the sun. Overall we have a wonderful experience in the hotel.

But I am thrilled we stayed here. This is the only hotel I have ever stayed in that truly made me feel like a guest. The entire staff was courteous and attentive. The renovations were beautiful and the room was pristine and comfortable. The breakfast buffet was excellent and the in and out parking was super easy. For $35 a day we received the breakfast for two, parking, and other amenities. When we checked in and got to our room after a full day of travel we were too exhausted to move and so hungry. Within an hour of check in were were surprised with a knock on the door and complementary banana bread and fruit juice. Several days in we received a fruit basket in our room.

You can also walk along the beach or the road to the more central areas of Waikiki, there is a hotel shuttle bus as well, and a nearby stop for the Pink Link Waikiki Trolley service which also loops round between Ala Moana and the other end of Waikiki Beach.

It's easily accessible by rental cars, easy walking distance to Ala Moana Shopping Center and Ala Moana Beach Park. Despite being popular for functions, self parking has always been available. Front desk staff are amongst the best in the state - always friendly and greets me by my name. When I get picked up for the game, valet staff know I'm headed to Aloha Stadium and chat about the game. Staff at 100 Sails (bar) and Hinana Bar are very friendly and always ask my opinion of the game. For this update, my one problem was the TV in front of the treadmills in the Exercise Room. At the start of the football season, I had problems with the remote. It was a recurring problem that was ""fixed"" all but one time.

634297904,50,Customer Service!,Upon check-in my husband and I were given a room in the diamond head tower right above the pool. I was disappointed as we stay at this property often and coincidentally always stay in the ala moana tower. While the rooms are all the same I suppose I’m a creature of habit and not to mention this particular room (610) was very noisy from the activity below. When signing into the WiFi I was prompted to take a survey which asked how satisfied we were thus far. I gave a marginal star rating which resulted in the survey asking how my experience could be improved. Not thinking much of it I simply said a room in the ala moana tower was my preference. To our surprise not 5 minutes after submitting the survey we received a call from the front desk saying they had another room for us if we’d like to move! We did and were much happier with the new room.

634217780,50,Excellent hotel a bit removed from Waikiki madness,"After a few wonderfully relaxing, lazy days at the Kahala Hotel, I moved to this hotel to attend a convention. I chose this hotel for its proximity to the Convention Centre and its high TripAdvisor rating. I was also considering the Modern and Equus hotels nearby, but after taking peeks at those hotels, was very glad I chose the Prince. It was an excellent hotel close to but a bit removed from the chaos of central Waikiki, and also close to the Ala Moana Shopping Centre.    Service from the outset was universally friendly and accommodating. Check-in comes with a cool damp towel and a schedule for the hotel's shuttle, which can take you to the mall or to 2 drop-off points in Waikiki.  The hotel has 2 almost identical 33-story towers (Ala Moana and Diamond Head). It seems all rooms have some sort of ocean view, with the quality of this view determining the room category and cost.  I had either an Ocean Front Harbour or Ocean Front room on the 22nd floor of the Ala Moana (west) Tower. There were only 11 rooms on this floor. The floor-to-ceiling window overlooked the Ala Moana Yacht Harbour with the Pacific beyond. Looking straight down was the hotel's 5th floor rooftop pool area. To the left (east) was the Hilton Hawaiian Village Resort's lagoon and beach. To the right (west) was Magic Island and the Ala Moana Regional Beach Park. I had a great view of fireworks from the Hilton lagoon one night. None of the rooms have lanais, but a portion of the window did completely open. Window shades (block-out or sun-reducing) were electronically controlled. There was Naio flower art painted on the walls. Outlets and USP ports were well placed. There was a convenient minifridge and bottled water replenished daily. The safe was actually a large drawer that had a lock. Wifi was free, included in the daily resort fee, which also included some things that were above normal, such as free self-parking, 2 welcome drinks, 20% off the buffet and golf (offsite).  The bathroom was large, with an enclosed WC (Japanese Toto toilet that had bidet washing features but no drying feature), separate tub and stall shower. An oral hygiene and shaving kit are included with the resort fee.    The hotel has Club Level rooms on its highest floors, but the Club Lounge is actually located poolside. Also on the pool deck is the Hinana Bar (also serves light meals), the Muliwai Deck (outdoor space for private events) and the indoor fitness centre. There are 2 pools, one salt water, the other infinity-edged, plus a jacuzzi and cabanas.    I did not try either of the hotel's restaurants. 100 Sails has buffet and a la carte menus. Katsumidori Sushi Tokyo's first location outside of Japan was here. There's also a coffee spot in the lobby. The lobby gift shop has a well-curated selection of items, plus sundries and snacks. There's an ABC across the street.    Overall an excellent choice for Waikiki lodging.",Nov 2018,October 2018,Traveled on business,,"Pasadena, California"

Having just gotten off the cruise ship, we were looking for a simple, relaxing weekend in Honolulu. Due to the disembarkation schedule, we arrive at the hotel around 9am and thought we'd talk to the Front Desk. They couldn't have been nicer; they let me know that even though we were very early, they thought they could have a room ready by ~1000. They were happy to check our bags while we waited. In the meantime, we spoke to the concierge desk to arrange a tour for the day in the meantime, and they too were very accommodating. The room itself was fantastic, with automatic blinds that raise and lower at the touch of a button. There is also a fantastic pool/bar area on the 5th floor, and the pool area even includes a perimeter ""infinity pool"" overlooking the ocean. The turn-down service was spot-on (chocolates included!), and the bed was very comfortable.

Magic Island is at the right forefront and Hilton Hawaiian Village lagoon to the left. As you enter the lobby, the interior space takes you away. Open, airy, with lots of light. I booked a club room on the higher level for my cousin, teenage niece and I to stay one night. We needed a late checkout, since my flight left at 10pm the next day. At check in, they immediately granted this request with a 6pm checkout. Then, we were escorted to the club lounge, where they had hosts greet us to give a tour of this amenity. In the club lounge, they serve hot and cold items, snacks, desserts, beverages, including beer and wine on tap. Good beer and wine too! There’s board games you can take to your room. There’s indoor and outdoor seating overlooking the sunset and harbor. The lounge connects you to the pools, bar, cabanas and loungers. The wow factor at the infinity pool is on high level at this point. It’s also a treat on Friday nights, you can see the fireworks from the pool area!    We finally head to our room on the 31st floor. Wow factor just shot to infinity. You are greeted by floor to ceiling glass, overlooking the ocean and harbor below, and the windows open to let the trade wind breeze come in.

Lastly, I’d like to take the moment to rave about the hospitality we received from the Club room hosts, especially Marley. She was so sweet, and if she didn’t know the answer, she’d get it for you. This all ties back to my review title. They’ve all made me and my guests (local residents) feel welcomed.

Even from our first dealing with the staff at the hotel, I knew they will treat their guest(s) well. I spent over 15 minutes on the phone with Shannon at reservation and provided very insightful knowledge of the island and the current events in HNL. Checking in was a breeze but it was somewhat a minor nuisance that we have to check in on the 5th floor instead of the front desk in the lobby. I'm all for efficiency so whichever will get me into the room first is the way to go. Everyone at the hotel are friendly and very helpful. Also the hotel is nicely renovated. It looks very modern but very tasteful. Our family stayed at other 5 stars hotels in Honolulu before and this hotel is certainly way up there! Both of our rooms were on the highest floor in the Diamond Head wing so the views were stellar. Would be a big bonus if there is a balcony.

Definately reccommend to see a different side of Waikiki down by the Harbour and across from Ala Moana. Would definatley return and reccommend.

An issue emerged in our room during the course of night one but, when we reported it to reception on the next morning, they did not hesitate to move us to a different room without any question and full of apologies. It turned out that the issue was not resolved in subsequent rooms but they persisted and, within a few hours, we ended up with a magnificent room. Later that day - thinking we were jinxed, we encountered a mechcnical noise in the ceiling above our room and the maintenance staff replaced a pump in less than 30 minutes. And they were so apologetic - but it was amazing service in our view.    The location of this hotel is very close to Ala Moana shopping centre; it is a good distance from the craziness of Waikiki but is really only a 10-15 minute walk when you do head there, It has great staff and was very comfortable.

The staff is very friendly and helpful. The room decor is clean and modern (I'm all about the gram, so I'm super picky about that!)    My boyfriend and I preordered room service for breakfast the prior night via the door hanger menu, and there were some issues in this morning with receiving our order. We called the room service extension, but no one was answering, so we called concierge to see if they could help. Noelani was extremely helpful, she made sure we got our breakfast right away and even went ABOVE AND BEYOND to personally come to our room and make sure the order was received. We also had a cabana rental that day and she graciously provided us a later check out time so we could freshen up after spending time at the pool.    Speaking of the pool, the pool itself is very instagenic and the poolside service is top notch. I got to spend time lounging at the cabana while my boyfriend made a few friends watching football at the pool bar. How typical.    Before we checked out, concierge helped us get a reservation at Katsu Midori. Nom nom.    Everything from start to finish was an amazing experience, and on the drive home we were already planning our next staycation at the Prince.

631039129,50,Great Hotel!!!! So happy I chose to stay here.,"This is the first time I have stayed at this hotel. I chose the Prince Wailkiki as I could see it would be a 5-10min stroll to the Ala Moana shopping centre and I was only there for 1 day/night. The hotel was modern, very clean and the staff were lovely. The swimming pool has a beautiful outlook and provides pool side service. After experiencing a crazy, busy, overcrowded resort in Maui, this hotel provided the relaxation and quality service I needed. I stayed with my two daughters 12 and 9. I would highly recommend staying in the club rooms as it gives you access to the club lounge which provides complimentary breakfast from 6am, snacks during the day, early evening, coffee, wine, beer. Having the ability to grab a quick breakfast and coffee for myself and my children before our early flight just made out departure that much easier.

631007879,40,Great stay,"I booked three nights here because of TripAdvisor reviews. My expectations were very high. The front desk staff were nice and accommodating but they didn’t go out of their way to make me feel any special. For example, I did expect the front desk person to walk me to the elevator as I noticed that other staff did that with families and couples. I wondered if there was a bias against solo travelers. My room was fabulous and clean but the walls could be thin. I was lucky to get a corner room and only had to deal with late-night noise from one side. The floor-to-ceiling Ocean Front Room is great but you would wish there was a balcony. I liked the modern fixtures and furnitures of the room. When I asked for housekeeping service the next morning and came back in the afternoon, they didn’t take away my room service dishes from the previous night and didn’t provide the two daily complimentary bottles of water in the fridge. I enjoyed the pool but it’s not heated so mornings are quite cold in the pool. The sliver of infinity pool was nice but it wasn’t clean. The water was very cloudy. I liked the self-parking lot which connected to the hotel lobby and mezzanine. I also liked the convenience store with Japanese and local products and Honolulu Coffee Company in the lobby. My best experience here was in the new spa. I opted for the Hawaiian LomiLomi massage which was nice and worthwhile after a long day of outdoor activities. Overall, it’s all in the details for me and I hope that the service improves as the hotel tries to maintain its top status.

I loved the frequency of the tidying of the rooms mid day, and the turn down service in the evening.  The toilet/bidet is something that should be in every household!!  Infinity pool overlooking the harbor is wonderful as well.  Our only hiccup with our stay is we still have a $1,000+ hold on our credit card two weeks later, even though our stay was paid in full upon checkout, and has cleared with the credit card immediately.

While not inexpensive, our money was well spent, with this hotel providing the highest quality benchmark for our remaining accommodation to meet during our three week holiday. This hotel is truly worth it - from wonderful staff through to thoughtful amenities (do try the ice cold fruit infused water in the lobby). An amazing start to an amazing trip.

We stayed next door at the Modern a few months ago and there is no comparison. The Modern is very beat up and although you have a nice view, a lanai, and a very, very spacious room, there is attention lost in the details. They need a thorough overhaul for that price point and I would gladly spend a little more for a room at the Prince that is perfect.

We are not fan's of the dinner menu or the $25 per night self parking fee, but those are minor off sets by everything else. Forgot to mention the rooms are larger than typical and include couches and both upgraded showers and a separate full bath. We feel the price is a better value compared to other similar hotels.",Oct 2018,October 2018,Traveled as a couple,"We prefer rooms on the 12th floor or above.

626204572,50,Impeccable Hotel with equally incredible staff,"We had an incredible stay at Prince Waikiki, there is nothing that could be done to better the experience. The banana bread on arrival and the chocolates in the evenings are little extra's that set this hotel apart. We had an incredible 4 night stay with Prince Waikiki and wished that we could have stayed longer. The heated toilets seats were an absolute bonus and went down very well with our kids. My husband left his bag in the room and only realised once we arrived at the airport. Lani at the front desk was incredible and went up to the room, found it and put it in a cab for him, all the time keeping him informed about what was happening. He rang him back (on an international number) to give him the cab registration number and details. First class service all the way and i can't thank the staff enough for making the end of our holiday a special one. The rooms are big with lots of storage room and the bathrooms are beautifully decorated whilst being very practical.

The property was extremely clean and tidy, and outlook over the marina was just lovely.

However, upon arrival we found out there was a “mandatory” $30 fee in exchange for WiFi, parking (we didn’t have a car), an eco bag, and two toothbrushes. Having packed my own toothbrush for the trip, I was disappointed to hear about this surprise fee. However, one major redeeming quality was their on site rental cars with a fixed price. We decided at the last minute to rent a car and visit the north shore of Oahu and when we asked for guidance at the concierge, we realized that they had their own supply of cars significantly cheaper than going directly to enterprise.

I have traveled quite a bit and stayed in some exclusive hotels--the Prince Waikki exceeds them. The design and layout of the hotel is gorgeous as well as the many sitting areas. The buffet is delicious and well prepared. But what is most striking is the friendliness of the staff and the degree of service. A tip by one waitstaff person saved us hundreds of dollars.

While we stayed at the hotel a hurricane passed by and the club lounge was closed for 3 days but to make up for it the hotel gave us passes to the 100 sails restaurant for all three meals a day. I call that a great deal. In addition the room was great on the 31st floor with great ocean views and very clean. The workers at each level appear happy and efficient.

Even better was the coffee voucher the lady at reception gave us when we were so exhausted from the travel.

The only things that I can think of that need improving are 1. different coffee service such as Keurig, 2. a second sink in the bathroom instead of a tub. The wall of windows made it feel as if we were outside. Loved the infinity pool. We experienced a more quiet vibe at the pool than you would get at the larger resorts in Waikiki. We had breakfast each morning at the 100 Sails bar. If you sat in the bar, there was an express breakfast instead of the buffet. $5 got you 2 eggs, anyway you wished, plus 2 slices of toast. $8 for a ham and cheese omelet, plus toast. Coffee was $4. Can't beat those prices. They also had items to go. Two bottles of water in the room, complimentary and with the heat and humidity during our stay, was very much welcomed. Happy hour had 1/2 price food items. Buffet, not sure if I would say expensive since I don't care for buffets so I have no comparisons. My husband had the dinner buffet and much enjoyed it (they have a seniors discount). I ordered off the menu in place of the buffet. The menu is very limited. The food was all very good.

The pool is on the 5th floor and open 24 hours! They have bar service until 7pm daily and on Friday night they had live music as well. Beach towels were provided at the front desk whenever needed. Shuttle service was not necessary to Ala Moana center because it is literally down the street from the hotel. We used the lobby store and coffee shop almost every day which was super convenient but I wish they had given us some kind of voucher for free coffee since we were there for 9 nights.

And of course, the pool deck with infinity pool is just stunning. The view you have from both the room with floor-ceiling windows and the infinity pool never gets boring. Looking out at the harbor is, especially during sunset, so mesmerizing. If you have the time and don’t mind getting up early, you should definitely try one of the complimentary cultural activities the hotel offers. We did the hula dancing and Tai chi and that was so much fun! It was too bad we didn’t have time to join the morning health walk trough the parks and along the beaches. Besides that, there is a lot of entertainment in the hotel. Several times a week there a live bands playing at the Hinana bar at the pool deck and at the 100 Sails restaurant.

The bathroom was trendy with lovely amenities. The staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful. The Sails restaurant was light and bright and the food looked delicious. We had drinks but did not eat. Very popular with guests. Hotel is on the fringe of the Waikiki hotels and very close to the Ala Moana shopping mall, you can walk there in less than 10 mins.

Overtime, nothing really struck me with the prince but within the last month, I was able to stay at the NEWLY RENOVATED Prince Waikiki.    I couldn't recognize anything from 10 years ago apart from the massive building. Enough fluff, let's cut to the good stuff:    *Only a 15 minute walk to, at one point, the largest open air mall in the US - Ala Moana!  *Lieterally, a 10 minute walk to the nearest surf spot (Bowls, Kaisers, Rock Piles)  *10 minute walk to the nearest beach  *Breakfast at 100 Sails was phenomenal! (Recommend the Acai bowl!)  *Friendly staff and services  *Infinity pool with bar service!  *Gorgeous views of the sunset!!!    Our time at the Prince was a speedy weekend but it was thoroughly enjoyed by my family of 3. We spent most of our time exploring and lounging around the pool area. The view overlooks Ala Wai Harbor and hosts magnificent sunsets every night while we were there!  At the entrance of Waikiki, The Prince Luxury Hotel welcomes visitors to a Hotel rooted in Hawaiian History as a previous estuary - previously and alluded to in their new redesign, that was once alive with fish ancient Hawaiians sustained in order to thrive!

617097545,50,"Finally, a hotel in Waikiki that doesn't take advantage of you!","My partner and i were extremely happy with everything about this hotel. We stayed here during what was going to be Hurricane Lane, and the staff were very supportive of all guests through all the uncertainty. The big point i wish to mention, which says a lot about the ethics of a hotel in what is typically a tourist rip off location, is that the hotel never once took advantage of guests during the hurricane. In comparison we had fiends staying at the Hawaiian Hilton village who were charged a ridiculous $49US p/p breakfast for the 2 days that guests were asked to stay inside the hotel. They had no choice but to pay as every cafe was closed outside the hotel due to the pending hurricane arrive. The Price Waikiki however, took the absolute opposite approach which i totally respect. They offered guests a $12.50 breakfast that almost mirrored the ridiculous Hilton offering. Well done Prince Waikiki, that is how you win customers for life. For readers tossing up between the Hilton and Prince Waikiki, like we were, go the Prince all the way. You can walk 8 mins down the road and use all the overcrowded Hilton facilities if you choose anyway..",Sep 2018,August 2018,Traveled with family,,"Sydney, Australia"

The bell staff, reception desk staff and housekeeping staff were all top-notch. The rooms were Very comfortable, something you would expect for the top rated hotel in Waikiki. They even have modern bidets on the toilets which is a underappreciated luxury that all hotels should provide.    The main complaint I had with the visit was the unprofessional attitude of the bartender at the pool. He was rude, condescending and had several guests commenting on what a butt head he was. The two female servers we’re having to make excuses for him saying that he had to work extra shifts. Not our problem buddy.    Overall, we had a great time. The hotels proximity to the Ala Moana shopping center was ideal to help pass the time when you were needing a break from the sun.

616501955,40,Modern hotel close to Waiki beach,"We stayed in Prince Waikiki for a couple of nights in September.    The hotel is conveniently located at the far end of Waikiki beach, in front of a beautiful marina and around the corner from Ala Moana shopping centre which is full of great shops and restaurants.    Check in was relatively quick but impersonal but our room was available earlier than the advertised check in time, which was great.    The room itself was very modern with beautiful views of marina, it had a comfortable double bed. Amenities in the bathroom were provided but basic.    We had breakfast included in our room rate and it was a highlight of our stay; hot station with eggs cooked to order, lovely fresh fruit and juices, selection of Hawaiian sweets and a few Asian dishes. Service in the restaurant was fantastic and the restaurant was never too crowded or noisy. I would highly recommend using the restaurant for breakfast. It was a great start to each day.    Hotel offers shuttle to other parts of Waikiki beach, we never used it as were happy to walk everywhere (the hotel is next door to Hilton complex and no more than 10 mins walk to the centre ofWaikiki beach) but it’s great for those who are in a hurry to get somewhere.    The swimming pool was always crowded. There were a lot of families staying at the hotel and the kids made it very noisy, it was probably my least favourite part of the hotel. There were also no umbrellas to hide from the direct sun.    Let me be clear, this is not a luxury hotel ( we stayed in Mandarin Oriental and Andaz during the rest of our trip) but neither is the price so the hotel is perfect if you are looking for a middle price hotel close to all the action. Overall we had a good stay but not entirely sure if we would stay here again.

The rooms are well appointed and spacious and our room had a great view of the marina and the harbor. High tech touches such as motorized window shades and a Japanese bidet/toilet seat provided no end of amusement. The staff was always available, helpful and friendly without being intrusive. Although the hotel does not front on the beach, the beach is not far and the amazing Ala Moana shopping center is easy walking distance. There is a complementary shuttle to take guests to various shopping venues but I can't imagine not finding what you want at Ala Moana as it is huge. Everything about Prince Waikiki was first rate: the amenities, the infinity pool, the service...I can't think of anything to complain about. One note, however is that the hotel is probably more suitable for adults rather than families with young children.

615287604,40,Good hotel overall but got works to do,"We stayed in room 3011 and 3013 for 5 days.  Good: hotel room is newly renovated and it has great view of the marina. There are a lot of other details that make this hotel stand out. To give a few examples， the toilet seat is heated and fully automatic; our room offers both coffee machine and tea kettle; the blinds are also fully automated and has a few different privacy and blackout modes to choose from; room service was great.    Things to improve: 1. Hotel shuttle was poorly organized. We arrived at the lobby first (around 310pm for the 325pm shuttle) but multiple groups of tourists jumped lined and got on the shuttle so we had to wait and eventually had to take a taxi. Although hotel pays for it but we had to wait for some time and people were still jumping lines for taxis. The doorman is not doing anything to prevent this from happening. 2 room 3013 is one room away from the elevator on the opposite side of it. It has significant amount of noise from the elevator room when the elevator is running. the noise is annoying and very loud in the middle of the night when someone is going to or calling for the elevator above our floor. It felt like someone was playing marble balls upstairs . As a result our sleeping schedule was reduced to 1am - 6am ish everyday. Please have someone come to the room and hear it. It is not something you would expect from a $400+ and best rated hotel on triparvisor. 3. Hotel had no beach and pool and fitness room is small. It only has one elliptical machine and at busy times I had to switch to treadmill for exercise.    Overall if you are looking for a resort that has a beach and nice pool, we would pick rainbow tower (Hilton) that we stayed in four years ago. But if you want a nicer room and good service, I would recommend Prince Waikiki if they can improve their services.",Sep 2018,September 2018,Traveled with family,,"Redmond, Washington"

I also love the location of this hotel, it’s not crazy busy so you get to relax, it’s not loud and it is so easy to get in and out of this hotel if you are driving, unlike other parts of downtown Waikiki where it is traffic due to people crossing/ walking and getting in and out hotels.

610573061,30,All in all excellent hotel with poor front of house staff,"This would have been the perfect Waikiki hotel for me if the start and end experience matched the rest of hotel. Upon arrival I exited shuttle bus and opened my own hotel door to gain access with no offer of assistance. Check in was no better with reception confirming name, taking card and giving me a welcome message in envelope before sending me on my way to room, in all of less than 10 words.  The Ocean Front room itself was excellent with modern conveniences and floor to ceiling windows looking out over harbour. The delivery of a welcome fruit basket a few moments later was a pleasant surprise and almost made up for the arrival but it was just that, a welcome basket, as next day it was removed with still half its content left.  Hotel for me was in a good location for the conference centre. It is only 5 minutes from being able to put feet in sand but does sit at top end of Waikiki. Main city area is a good 15 minute walk or shuttle/trolley ride.  I did try to make use of concierge services but they seemed a little lacking in knowledge given I was after information on Neal S. Blaisdell Center, a major event location, but they didn't seem to know best way to get there and resorted to showing me Google map path.  One of the saving features of the hotel is the onsite Honolulu Coffee Company, great for early morning pick me up and run by a very friendly team.  My check out experience was no better with reception communicating even less, didn't even enquire as to my stay. Then I had to interrupt the door staff laughing between themselves to get help with bags.  All in all an excellent hotel with poor front of house staff.

Arrival- Simply wonderful from the moment we arrived. Cases to our rooms instantly and a friendly welcome.  The Room - wow!!! Simply stunning - just look at the pictures and let the view do the talking. Modern, elegant and perfect.  The gym - never to busy and just what we wanted.  The pool - lovely views of the harbour and the infirmity pool and the hot tub are bonus. The pool bar is great except if not a little expensive if you are not used to prices. How great would it be if they did a little happy hour for the sunset? The waitering staff were good but I would suggest that you get around to everyone (I know it’s hard) because some people felt left out.  Restaurant - good. We ate breakfast through the express and formally and both were great. Pool bars food was good.  Staff - kind, caring and always willing to go that extra mile. Sent us a few desserts to the room because we got engaged on Magic Island.  Coffee house - brilliant place for a coffee, breakfast and chill in the Honolulu Coffee Company at reception.  Location- a short stroll to the heart beat (or business) of Waikiki. Beaches to the left and beaches to the right. So quiet though - in the best possible way. You do feel like your out of the hustle and bustle of Waikiki. It’s simple wonderful. Don’t worry about not having the hotel on the beach - it literally doesn’t matter.

Hotel offers free shuttle to Ala Moana Center and walk to Waikiki beach is about 10 minutes. ABC stores are also just steps away from the hotel.    We tried Katsumidori Sushi for dinner. It is best to secure reservation as they are normally booked up. We were there at 5:30 and waited about 45 mins but again the food and service was well worth it.",Aug 2018,August 2018,Traveled with friends,,"Toronto, Canada"

We also appreciated being able to open the windows, upon which AC went off automatically, a cool idea to save energy. All service was prompt, courteous, and satisfying. Room service, laundry service, valet parking—these were all terrific. Gift shop had fresh snacks and good selection of wines and beer. Fitness room tidy and all in good repair.

607209545,50,Quiet And Comfortable,"The Prince is located on the western edge of Waikiki, away from all the noise and congestion of the beach crowds. Every room has a beautiful view of the marina and Ala Moana park. The Prince is a great place to stay if you don’t want to fight the beach crowds, but a ten minute walk gets you on the beach. Customer service is outstanding with everyone friendly and providing personalized service.  I would stress that the Prince IS NOT a traditional Hawaiian beach mega resort. It is not an opulent design, doesn’t have heavily landscaped courtyards and multiple restaurants like other chain hotels on Waikiki. It is quiet,comfortable, provides great service and offers a better value to those who aren’t looking for the mega resort amenities.  My wife and I just celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary staying at the Prince and it worked perfectly for us.

605379919,30,Pool noise,"First off, Prince Waikiki is a beautiful, modern, and clean hotel just like the photos depict but there was one thing about our stay that really bothered me. I booked our stay as part of a package on Travelocity and in the notes/comments section, I requested a quiet room with a King bed. The lady checking us in the hotel asked me if a queen bed would be ok. (This room was on the 6th floor). I told her I would prefer a room with a King bed. She then put us in a room on the 8th floor of the Ala Moana tower. When we got into the room, we immediately noticed that there was a constant noice and chatter coming from the pool area below on the 5th floor even though our windows were closed. I thought back that the lady had originally wanted to put us on the 6th floor which would even be closer to the pool area and the noise from the pool area would possibly be greater. My frustration stems from the front desk checkin personnel not reading or accommodating us on our request for a quiet room. She was not cognizant that a room on a lower floor closer to the pool area would have noise coming from the pool area. Not every hotel guest staying at the hotel will be bothered by noise so if a guest specifically requests a quiet room, I think the checkin personnel should accommodate that. That would be providing excellent service.",Aug 2018,August 2018,Traveled with family,,
605155304,40,Gorgeous property,"As first time visitors to Hawaii, we’re glad we ended our stay at Prince Waikiki. We’re frequent travelers and this hotel is one of the best we ever stayed in. Pool area is beautiful and there’s always enough lounge chairs to go around. We booked a club floor room on the 32nd floor and the view was stunning. However, we do feel that front desk staff needs more training. They never explained that we could check out at the lounge to avoid a line instead of at the front desk. This is supposed to be one of the perks of booking their club room. We approached one of the ladies at the lounge and asked her to check us out. The whole checkout process took 20 minutes and there was no line! They tacked on fees that weren’t supposed to be there and the lady had to confer with the front desk to sort it out. Few other niggles: no cold towels and no amenity package (Prince Waikiki bag with amenities) upon arrival, inconsistent turn down service, food in the lounge gets repetitive after a few days.

From the check in staff to the staff on the pool deck, everyone was amazing. I spent the majority of my time during my stay at one of their ocean front cabanas. These can be rented for the day and are so worth every penny. Jenny, the pool deck bartender, was efficient and very tentative to my needs. She offered several specialty cocktails as well as lunch dishes. I tried the mushroom flatbread, taro chips, ahi poke, and sushi roll and each entree was to-die-for. Later that night, my parter and I enjoyed a private dinner overlooking the Honolulu docking area. I didn't get our server's name, but once again, we experienced the definition of luxury meeting 5 star service.    I cannot rave enough about this place. Waikiki can feel hectic at times, but if you are looking to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city for a couple days, this hotel has a convenient location, yet feels much more ""secluded"" than any other Waikiki hotel I've stayed at in the way that it feels much more quiet and laid-back from your typical tourist destination. 5 stars for Prince- I will definitely be back!",Aug 2018,July 2018,Traveled with friends,,

Only stayed here 2 nights/1 full day at the end of our trip and we spent the day shopping so didn’t enjoy the full hotel experience, however what we did experience was great. The front desk helped my husband post a package and they sent up some packing tape straight away to help us box up our purchases. Had a great value and quick breakfast at 100 Sails bar before we headed out for the day. Enjoyed the pool late that evening with its lovely view across the marina and infinity pool and spa.

Located at the edge of the busy section of Waikiki (8 minute walk) but within minutes of Ala Moana Shopping mall this hotel is fabulous. Clean, modern, well maintained spacious rooms. These rooms are very spacious - but with plenty of seats / sofa's / desk area. We were on the 11th floor in a room with king size bed and our children had a room with 2 x Queen size beds. We particularly like the bathroom layout of seperate full bath, seperate shower and seperate toilet. Plenty of room and privacy and always immaculately cleaned. Every room faces the view over the ocean / marina.  Buffet breakfast at the Sails restaurant was very good. The buffet is smaller than some hotels - but well stocked with a great variety and excellent service (we had just come from a Hilton on Hawaii Island where all the breakfast flatware and cutlery was dirty and chipped).  We used the pool area which has, as well as a standard pool and spa, a fabulous infinity pool with views of the Marina and ocean. There were plenty of pool side chairs.  We had excellent service all round and of particular note from Joanne and Ken at the front desk - who were very helpful to us with our arrangements. There is a shuttle that runs hourly to Ala Moana and down to the heart of Waikiki - we used this several times.  As regular visitors to Hawaii, we have stayed at many Waikiki hotel (Sheraton, Outrigger, Hyatt, Hilton, Modern - to name a few) - the Prince is now our 'go-to' hotel.

Small things -- only person on floor who didn't receive a newspaper every morning, had to call for my room to be cleaned when I returned at 4:00 PM one day, WIFi failed my last night when I needed it the most (2 complaints, including a visit to the front desk didn't seem to make a difference), no record of my Prince Preferred account in the hotel computer, my key card would open the gym -- but not what I expect from a pricey hotel.

My wife called to tell me that she tripped over the sidewalk in the Harbor area. Upon tripping she skinned up both knees, both hands, and scuffed up her chin, lip, nose and forehead. She returned to the Prince where she was promptly attended to by Mark of the Bell Staff, and JoAnn at the front desk. They were over the top attentive with cold, moist towels to soak up the blood as well as tending to wounds. The staff was beyond the call of duty responsive. JoAnn called Doctors on Call, they came to the Prince to tend to my wife, took her to their office, treated her wounds and returned her to the property. JoAnn had stated that she would pay for a Taxi from Doctors on Call if they could not deliver my wife back. Today everything is good, my wife is healing, life is settling back into a normal pace. It was amazing that a day or two later Mark was still checking on the well being of my bride. Upon check out I was able to personally thank these two all stars.

591711116,10,Never Again,"So I wanted to like this place and was looking forward to it based in the good reviews. But it turns out that this is one of the worst hotels that I've ever stayed in and trust me, I've stayed in many.    I started by booking the Ocean View room, which I was told would have a good view of the ocean. I requested a very high floor and a complementary upgrade to a larger room (I'm a rewards member) since in addition to being here for business for almost three weeks, I also brought my family along for Father's day and a birthday and wanted to make sure this super long stay in this hotel was a great memory. Unfortunately, it has not been that at all.    When we checked in we were told that we did in fact get an upgrade to an ocean front room on the 6th floor, which if you've stayed here you know that is NOT a high floor. It's almost right over the lobby based on how the hotel is built. I asked for a higher floor and the lady told me none were available but that I had received a huge upgrade. So I said OK thanks and go to the room.    We arrived to the room and to my surprise the room is right over the pool, almost on the same level. I could see people and they could see right into my room. I could also hear them very well. Additionally, the room was tel he exact same size as pre-upgraded ocean view room that we were originally booked for. In addition to the pool, the view also included the harbor filled with boats, and not the ocean. The room was also on sort of a weird a corner so you couldn't see anything to the right but a cement wall.    So I called the front desk to confirm that this was in fact an upgraded bigger ocean front room and the guy said it was a harbor view and the same size as what I had originally booked. So I asked him to explain the difference between the upgrade and what I had originally and also why I had not been put on a higher floor. Especially because I was not originally supposed to have a harbor view, which is actually a downgrade. He couldn't explain the difference. So I think they overbooked this hotel and gave me what was left over and tried to make me believe I was getting a better deal, when in reality it was worse.    I ended up being moved to the 10th floor, which is still not high when you take in consideration that the hotel goes up to about 33 floors! We actually went up to the 30th floor to see the difference of the view and it was night and day from what we have. It was a true ocean view. So I feel like they are doing some false advertising. Also we told them we needed a high floor not only for the view but also because we needed a quiet room since we have a baby.    The room we have now that we were moved to on the 10th floor is exactly the same as the one on the 6th floor, they just moved us. We still see the boats and very little of the broader ocean and we still see the wall.    Additionally, I've noticed that there has been random long strands hair that is not ours EVERYWHERE in this room and it's so gross! In the bed and all over the bathroom.    The room also is not cleaned well. When you look in the mirror at the rim of the sink you see black gunk, so gross. And dirty mildew/mold in the shower and bathtub. The doors to the bathroom and shower are glass that is not cleaned often. And because they are glass, you definitely notice. Bottom line is the rooms need a serious deep clenaing.    It is also super noisy. You can hear everything, especially because we are right by the elevators. It sounds like they are working on something or doing construction.    They also had a false fire alarm yesterday and had people in a panic for no reason.    The hotel is nothing special and the food is SUPER expensive even though is not that great. I got one small mushroom breakfast sandwich and it was $8!    Avoid this place like the plague. We have tried everything to find another hotel but everything was sold out for our long stay or super expensive. We usually stay at the Marriott Ko Olina. Much nicer and they have lagoons.    We can't wait to get out of here. This has ruined this long trip to Hawaii. Smh!",Jun 2018,June 2018,Traveled on business,,

This was our first experience at a luxury hotel and they did not disappoint. We were able to check in around 8:30 in the morning which was greatly appreciated since we had parasailing at 10 a.m. We had booked the club floor room that gives you access to a lounge with fantastic amenities! We also paid for included breakfast with the room Upon our arrival, we were escorted to the 5th floor where our check-in would take place. We were greeted by professional men that took care of our luggage. I'm not very good with names, but I would like to thank the lady who did our check-in as she allowed us to have breakfast in the lounge while she was organizing everything for our stay in their system. She explained how we could get in the lounge with ease, also where the pool was (just outside the lounge), the gym (more on that later) and we were then guided to the elevator on our way to our room. A handwritten letter from the general manager was also given to us which is a lovely touch to the beginning of our stay. After opening the door to our room on the 32nd floor, our breath was taken away by the amazing view over the harbour and the ocean! The bell boy who brought our luggage explained everything there was to know about the room. That was greatly appreciated as we didn’t have to figure out anything on our own later. The VIP lounge located on the 5th floor next to the pool was phenomenal! They served a solid breakfast and we could enjoy it outside with a nice view over the harbour and the ocean. They served eggs, potatoes/hash browns, fruits, yoghurt and a variety of bread. The lounge was very quiet and relaxing. We loved spending some time by the pool! The lounge also served soup and hors-d’oeuvre throughout the day. Their pastries are awesome! The one thing we couldn't believe was when we left for 15minutes, came back and to our surprise... housekeeping had cleaned our room!!! Plus, they gave us a couple local chocolates (they did that both days we were there!!!). The entire hotel is so quiet, we slept like babies and found our stay to be very relaxing and perfect just before heading home.

Adjacent to the beautiful pool, the Club provides a hot breakfast, mid-day snacks that make a great light lunch, evening pupus and a nice assortment of beverages including craft draft beer and wine. You enjoy these treats in a private covered lanai overlooking the harbor or in an air-conditioned alcove. We didn't use them, but the Club is staffed with a personal concierge if you need dining reservations or tour bookings. If you're planning to spend most of your time in the hotel relaxing by the pool this is a great amenity.    The spacious and luxurious room had an unobstructed panoramic view of the ocean and Ala Moana Beach Park. Lots of nice room amenities including a mini refrigerator, large safe, robes and slippers, Keurig coffeemaker and hot water pot. The five-star bathroom features a Toto washlet, one of Japan's greatest contributions to the world.    The property is on the west end of Waikiki within easy walking distance of the Ala Moana shopping center, the convention center and Ala Moana Beach Park. While not on the beach it's a five minute walk to the Duke Kahanamoku Lagoon (basically a huge saltwater pool) and the beach fronting the Hilton Hawaiian Hotel. It's a pleasant 20 to 30 minute walk along the beach to central Waikiki or you can catch the free hotel shuttle that runs throughout the day. The location is great for kama'aina that want to meet with family or friends as they won't have to drive into the heart of Waikiki.    We had a delicious dinner at Katsumidori Sushi Tokyo. They use top quality fish and have unique presentations that we haven't had at other US sushi restaurants. While service was attentive they also feature tablet ordering at your table so that you can easily add something to your order when your server's not around. We found it to be a great value for the quality of ingredients and generous portions.

It's a very easy walk (along the beach path) to get to the center of Waikiki, if you need to go there. The hotel also offers a free and convenient shuttle that we used several times.

590022843,50,"Lovely Hotel, Great Views!","Stayed at this lovely hotel from 6/10/18 - 6/12/18 and wished we could have stayed longer. I chose to stay at this location mainly because it was a little further away from the main Waikiki area. The hotel's immediate surroundings were nice and calm, and not packed with tourists like myself, haha. When we drove into the main Waikiki area, it was super crowded and not relaxing at all!    The lobby is super gorgeous, and the staff at reception were so friendly and welcoming. We were given cold hand towels to freshen up and also received a hand-written note from the hotel manager, which I thought was a nice touch.    We received a complimentary upgrade to a room on the 31st floor with an awesome ocean view. The room was clean, fresh and spacious, and the bathroom was quite large. We booked direct on their site, so we didn't have to pay the daily resort charge and also got free parking!    There's a Honolulu Coffee Company right in their lobby, which was so convenient! We didn't receive drink vouchers like some other reviewers have mentioned though (maybe I missed them?). There was a Keurig machine in our room, with coffee cups, coffee pods and tea bags. There's also a mini-fridge, which came with 2 free bottles of Aloha water.    The only slight hiccup we experienced was with parking - neither of our room keys worked when going in and out of the structure due to some issue they were experiencing with their system. But we were able to get a validated ticket to use and re-use, so it really wasn't a big deal. Parking spots were also easy to find.

Also you get free coffee everyday but they don’t provide milk so you have to ring down and ask for some. In the end we bought our own and stored it in the fridge.    We went in the restaurant for breakfast and brunch. They have a huge selection of food and it tastes great, however we regret the brunch because it was so expensive.    The pool was good, there was always free loungers so it wasn’t too busy. Sometimes the bartenders took a long time to serve us and we had to visit the bar ourselves to get drinks.

589070279,50,The entrance hotel to Waikiki delivers!,"I have vacationed in Honolulu at least 15 times over the years. My two favorite hotels are the Hawaiian Hilton Village and the Prince Waikiki. This year I stayed at the Prince for 10 glorious days.    There are many advantages at this fine hotel. First the views from every floor overlooks the ocean. I stayed on the 11th floor but we were happy. The staff is extremely helpful and professional. The rooms are very clean and I love the remodel. Bathroom is nice with separate tub and shower. Even the toilet seats are warmed which I admit is nice.    The hotel is the first turn in after heading west from the Ala Moana shopping center so you literally miss all the Waikiki traffic (a big plus). Freeway access is easy going virtually anywhere. They offer some great restaurants on-site with happy hour treats.    The hotel is set up for business stay and have USB ports right by your bed so you can charge multiple devices while using them. It looks to be a favorite for airline pilots and stewardesses as well. Never a wait for the elevators which is a big plus (one of the things I disliked about the Hawaiian Hilton Village).    Several things I missed was a microwave. Perhaps thats how they keep the rooms so clean? I enjoyed going out and eating anyways. Also they have limited drawer availability. In our room only one drawer was available (the others are the safe, bar, and coffee maker).    Small price to pay. I will make this my hotel of stay in the future now that we are retired and not in a family with kids vacation mode.

Dining is good, with live music Friday - Sunday nights. Infinity pool has a beautiful view of the marina, as does the rooms. Superb outlook. Beds are so comfortable and the shower is the best!

586271013,50,Modern hotel in quiet setting,"My wife and I were travelling on our honeymoon in Hawaii and this was our first stop. The service upon check-in was fantastic and, even though we had arrived quite a bit early, they were able to find an open room. They were even kind enough to give us an upgraded, ocean-view room and they also had complimentary champagne and banana bread delivered to us for our honeymoon. Overall, we very much enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay here again when visiting Honolulu. Here are a few things we enjoyed about the hotel and we hope people find helpful:    - The hotel itself is situated in a great location, with easy walking to restaurants, Waikiki beach, shops, etc. (they also have a complimentary shuttle, but we did not use this). We found the location, since it is not right on the beach, to be a bit quieter and relaxing.  - There were fewer kids than we expected and from what we saw at other properties, which gave the hotel a more adult and tranquil vibe.  - The pool area was great and we never found it too crowded. We opted to rent a private cabana for half a day, which we would definitely recommend. The cabana includes two drinks, two bottles of water, sunscreen, and a pizza that was big enough for two. We thought the price was actually a bit of a steal given that the cost of the individual items by themselves was just about the cost of the half day rental. Also, special thanks to Howard that helped us that day at the pool. He was incredibly friendly and provided great recommendations of places to eat and sites to see  - The rooms were very clean and modern and had a very good sized bathroom with shower and tub. Our room did not have a balcony but the windows do open up enough to get a good breeze and hear the ocean  - From a food situation, there are decent options on site such as: a convenient store that was not terribly overpriced and a coffee and snack bar that had a great acai smoothie / bowl. We would not recommend the onsite restaurant as we thought, for the price, there are better options around the city.",Jun 2018,May 2018,Traveled as a couple,,"Camarillo, California"
586251603,50,Good value for such a nice hotel near the beach,"I stayed at the Prince for 3 nights and had a great stay. The great reviews and decent price point for what looked like such a nice hotel near Waikiki beach is what initially attracted me. The hotel sits near the top of Waikiki beach across from the docks . All the rooms have an ocean view out over the docks with spectacular views of the sunset (see pictures). The room was spacious and the bed and linens were very comfortable. The window opened up onto the docks so you could catch the ocean breeze in your room when you wanted. I would open it up when I woke up in the morning in particular and that was a nice feature. The room was pretty technologically advanced. There were remote operated shade and blackout curtains that kept the room pretty dark when you wanted it to be. The TV had Google Chromecast which was a feature I had not seen at a hotel before. With that, I was able to stream anything from my phone to the tv (Netflix, HBOGO, Hulu etc), which was a really nice option to have for before bed. But the most technologically advanced feature was the toilette seat. I’m not kidding. A lot of people may have been on one of these remote controlled toilette seats before but this was a first for me. It was heated, and had all sorts of different water jet cleaning settings, it was pretty crazy. The bathroom was in general pretty huge, which was also nice.    Outside the nice room, the lobby was big and spacious. The hotel sits on the corner of marina so there isn’t much traffic getting in and out. Valet was very convenient and only $8 more a night than self park which is included in the resort fee. The resort fee also includes the WiFi and you get a couple of drink vouchers and a beach tote that actually came in handy for me. The lobby also had a Hawaiian Coffee shop that had great pour over options so you could try several of the great local coffee options. You could also grab an açaí bowl there in the morning for breakfast. I would steer clear of the sushi restaurant in the hotel though unless you are a really serious sushi eater. I was one of the only English speaking people in the restaurant, and thought I was going to be amazed. It was just very, very raw. I’m usually a big sushi fan and do fine with the omikase option at most places but I couldn’t even eat a lot of what was put in front of me.    Back to the subject of the hotel, in terms of beach access it wasn’t a bad walk at all across the marina to Waikiki beach. The hotel runs shuttles but it isn’t worth waiting for I would say. Just walk! It is also not a bad walk over to the mall from the hotel. I would stay here again or The Modern if I was going to spend a little more.",Jun 2018,May 2018,Traveled on business,,"Charlotte, North Carolina"

We found ourselves walking towards Hilton everyday anyways which is just a 10min walk. Hilton has everything downstairs though.    View was good (pic shown). I thought I would get a view of the beach since I picked Ocean Front Premier. I did get the ocean view but the docks were right in front of us, but no sand.    Rooms were updated, bathroom was nicer than Hilton Resort (friend stayed there), no balcony but windows open all the way.

586088793,50,Great stay,"Stayed here for 8 nights. Awesome hotel, really great and helpful staff. Beautiful pools and pool area. Lovely view from our room. We arrived at 630am and fortunately were able to check in early! Such a huge relief after a really long flight with a 1 year old.    We had expected to be closer to Waikiki, and it did take 10-15mins to walk into the shopping area, waikiki beach was closer. However, we enjoy walking and the hotel did offer a free shuttle to a fair few different places, although we didn’t ever use it. Very close to the lagoon outside the Hilton which was an awesome place for our toddler to swim. He also LOVED the hotel pool.    It is a quiet area where the hotel is, however, we were on level 12 (despite asking to be on a higher floor and quiet room), and it wasn’t noisy as such but if something loud happened on the streets - sirens, loud cars etc you could hear it.    We had a few issues with room service, but the hotel dealt with these issues really well. Couldn’t be happier with the service we received. However it’s not an extensive room service menu - esp if you’re pregnant like me, and it wasn’t up to date. The hotel restaurant also doesn’t have many options aside from buffet. However, on our last day we ordered from the pool menu and it was awesome! No idea why the stuff on the pool menu isn’t on the room service but it really should be! So many better options on the pool menu and had we have realized we would’ve just gone and sat by the pool to order food. The menu to us was an issue because there isn’t anywhere really close by to go and get takeaway from. But as I said the hotel dealt with these complaints really well and we couldn’t be happier with our stay.",Jun 2018,June 2018,Traveled with family,,"Newcastle, Australia"

It had a view overlooking the harbor and the Waikiki skyline- divine to wake up to each morning. Plus, there were huge windows that actually opened, maybe not a huge deal to other people, but I LOVED having the fresh ocean air flood the suite every day.    2.

Everyone we came into contact with was great, but they really went the extra mile to make sure my family and I were taken care of.    3. LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION: The location was ideal. A plethora of restaurants, shops, bars and the beach were all within walking distance. There's also live music everywhere, which I loved.    4. POOL DECK: I think my favorite part of the hotel was their outdoor pool area, the Hinana Bar. The cocktails were SUPERB, the infinity pool is gorgeous, and they keep it all so clean. We were out there almost every day even if it was overcast just to have a Mai Tai and take in the view. AND there's a jacuzzi.    My sister, dad and I stayed for a week and honestly couldn't imagine staying anywhere else. Oh! One last thing, you have to eat at their sushi restaurant Katsumidori. The fish was so fresh, it was our favorite meal of the trip.    My family and I hold so many fond memories from Oahu and a great majority of them were with The Prince and their staff.

584827730,50,Just Surreal,"A totally unexpected, surreal experience. This beautiful hotel stay was the result of our aircraft failure en route from Vancouver to Auckland, New Zealand. Our airline booked half (lucky us) the passengers for one and a half days, complete with food and beverage voucher.    Unfortunately, due to the volume of incoming guests, our check in was quite lengthy, but the hotel staff walked through the throng with trays of banana and pineapple breads and cups of lime/lemon flavoured water. Once checked in, we were directed to our 32nd floor room. Entry to the room - WOW - what a beautiful suite and the VIEW - stunning - overlooking the marina and right down the beach and bays. You could count the surfers in the breakwater.    The room was 6 star - so tastefully decorated and two of the picture windows (a wall of glass0 opened to give you an amazing vista. The two queen beds had gorgeous pillows and linen, and the room was so spacious and equipped with plenty of storage for clothing, full floor to ceiling wardrobes, desk and reclining chair and table. WiFi access was complimentary. The bathroom, was huge and to die for - marble everywhere, plenty of space for his/her toiletries, and it also had separate toilet and shower room which ran off the bathroom with opaque glass doors.    This hotel has everything - restaurants, buffet, shops, dual access, and two gorgeous swimming pools (one infinity overlooking the marina/hotel entrance). Towels are provided and can also be taken one block away to the beach.    Being at the Marina end of the boulevard meant we were one block away from the famous shopping centre (stroll of 10 minutes), trolleys were accessible and taxis plentiful.    We slept like babies, dined like kings/queens, and breakfast was more than adequate.    Please, treat yourself, if only one/two nights, to an a surreal experience in this hotel. We totally loved our stay and the staff were just fantastic Thank you Prince in Waikiki for a unique experience and the icing on the cake to end our holiday on such a high (note).",Jun 2018,June 2018,Traveled as a couple,Marina side ONLY,"Taupo, New Zealand"

The rooms are beautiful and pristine...all of them have the harbor view and love the Japanese washlet toilets and separate shower/tub. The HH at the bar is also insane for Waikiki- my husband and I had drinks and bites to watch the Warriors game and it was only $26! The pool is small but perfect to chill by-it’s open 24 hours so if you like night swimming like me, it’s perfect. Free shuttles to and from nearby Waikiki spots, which we utilized to go out to dinners and shopping.

During the check in process Laura gave us an extra drink coupon because she realized we had a room with three people and a room with two people. A thoughtful gesture which costs the hotel virtually nothing.    The infinity pool had such inviting vibes, all five of us had to go down for a dip. The pool had poolside bar service and I spotted a few private cabanas.    After the pool the five of us enjoyed the Saturday night seafood buffet at the hotel. The buffet was good and accurately priced for the Honolulu upscale restaurant scene. After dinner a few of us strolled down to the Hilton Hawaiian Village. It’s still very much like a ski resort at the beach.    The hotel felt very much like the Peninsula in Chicago. The room included robes and slippers, upscale toiletries and fabulous lighting.

We live on island, in fact I was born here when the place was the old Kaiser Hospital, so I chose this hotel with that sense of nostalgia -- what an excellent choice for a 4d/3n staycation. Joanne at the lobby was so attentive and friendly, with great suggestions for dining choices. I was a bit put out to have to come back to the lobby because our card couldn't work to get into the parking garage, but Malaea took care of everything and was so welcoming. We wanted a room with a king bed because we were celebrating an anniversary, but unfortunately due to the holiday weekend, no room was available. But that didn't stop both Malaea and Joanne from making our weekend special. They set it up so when we got back from dinner, a bottle of Prosecco was on ice wand two glass flutes on the side were waiting for us in our room. What customer service! In fact, Malaea called the next day to say that a room opened up with a king bed and asked us if we would like to move into it! TOO GOOD! Did I mention the view? Our room had a view that spanned from Hilton Hawaiian Hotel to Magic Island--stunning! So much dining options to choose from -- 100 Sails Buffet in the hotel was scrumptious (see my review). Red Lobster, Outback Steakhouse are right next door, and down the street was McDonalds, Subway, and the best Indian restaurant on the island, Bombay Palace. We even walked a little way and came across a Chinese B/L/D buffet called Wok Kiki -- get it? Waikiki/Wok Kiki. And the hotel is so close to Ala Moana Shopping Center. You get the visitors and local experience in a very convenient and gorgeous location. The views, OMG the views! We will most definitely return here for our next staycation. If you're local, sign up to Prince Preferred so you can get emails of specials and promotions.

583399369,50,Just wow,"This was me and my wife’s first visit to The Prince. We booked a beautiful ocean view room looking over the marina. Cracking that big double door window open every morning; smelling and seeing the ocean was worth it in itself. The staff is the very definition of hospitality. They would even switch up the way they serviced our room. Sometimes they left an assortment of fruit in the fridge as a nice surprise or the complimentary custom molded chocolates would consist of a different Hawaiian creauture with a card explaining its significance to the islands. Just little details that made The Prince stand out from others. The resort also has a beautiful key hole pool aside an infinity pool that looks over the ocean. Poolside bar service is on point and the drinks are delicious. Consuming Mai Tai’s in that pool while watching the sun set will never get old. Parking was never an issue for us. During our week stay, there was only one time the lot was full and the vallet simply waived us down and offered a VIP slot for our vehicle. Again, the very definition of hospitality.

580259491,50,Prince Waikiki,"The Prince is two towers located at the very end of the hotel strip and people - read the reviews ! Do not be surprised by the fact that The Prince is not on the beach. There is a marina in front of the hotel, if you want beach your choices are to walk left to the Hilton lagoon area (fake beach or very rocky beach) or go right to Ala Moana public beach, which I consider a very nice, huge and typically uncrowded area with Magic Island protected swimming lagoon as well. If you want to see colorful and diverse folks this is the place. Must be safe because you see a lot of young beautiful gals our sunning by themselves, not that I would notice such things. So ! The Prince rooms are all ""view"" which to say the least is a wonderful view, the higher the better. You can watch the comings and goings of the boats and take in the vista. The very center rooms have unobstructed views, the ones left and right will have a restricted view but it doesn't really matter, the view is ""the view"". We had an end room by design as they tend to be the quiet rooms. Now the rooms, NO BALCONIES ! Unless you go the extra bucks for the suites, some of those rooms do have balconies. This area is expensive enough so we opted for a standard room, which do come equipped with large easy to open windows that allow for airflow and a sense of openness. Now would we rather have had a balcony to enjoy the evening, yes indeed but we spent most evenings in the pool area. Little tip the pool bar shuts down at 8:30 pm and you can ease into one of the cabanas which are quite lovely. The pool; one medium size one small infinity that boasts an impressive view. The pool can be completely overrun with screaming kids at times but what are you going to do, it's Hawaii. You want privacy you are going to have to go find it on a beach. The island is literally covered with amazing beaches so you will have to get out of the city. On the infinity pool, we noted it was pretty dirty one day with flotsam and jetsam circulating in the water...kinda gross but the main pool was spotless and then there is a shared hot tub. We personally don't do those, but other folks seemed to enjoy. Shade can be hard to come by if you need that, arrive early to grab the few places in the shade or shell out like $200 for a cabana :) The bar has good service, have to shout out Jenny who goes 1,000 miles an hour waiting on the whole busy area herself. She was always right there and super cheerful. Food is a limited menu but again arrived quickly in neat little boxes to keep it out of the sun. If you want to eat and drink out there, get out your checkbook, but again it's Hawaii people - and if you want cheaper then you will have to leave the hotel. On the staff each and every employee we interacted with was full of the Aloha spirit and I simply have nothing but positive interactions to take away from our visit. I was struck how maids would stop if you walked by, make eye contact and greet you warmly and sincerely. The hotel was recently renovated so it's still shiny. Rooms spacious, bathrooms as well. Parking is kind of funky you have to exit and enter on the 3rd floor go up or down stairs then an escalator to the lobby then over to your elevator. Not a huge deal but might be an issue for less mobile folks. In closing read the reviews folks and know what you are getting. The Prince is a top notch property but not in the center of town, so if you want out of the hustle and to be close to the big mall and public beaches (by the way ALL beaches on Oahu are public) then this is your hotel.

580202000,40,First time visitor to Oahu,"Great location however the website description of ocean front rooms should be changed to ocean view! There is nothing ocean front with this hotel, not even a beach area! We arrived st 4pm and there was no one to check us in! I walked to the concierge and one lady could not check us in while the lady next to her had no issues!  The rooms are well appointed and for a resort fee of $31.41 gets you free self parking and two bottles of water daily! As everything else in Waikiki meals are very expensive and if you can get a concierge level at a good rate do it, it will include the Prince club and covers your breakfast by the pool and other amenities! God forbid you walk in and you are not on the concierge level, the weekend ladies were protecting the treasures of the earth😉they would not part with even a glass of water 😜  With so many options at the price we paid and the room we got, I would strongly suggest a hotel with private beach and better service!",May 2018,May 2018,Traveled as a couple,,"Potomac, Maryland"

The only negative for me was the walking location being a bit busier due to it being on a busy street.

We would like to particularly thank Jo at the Front Desk who was incredibly kind and warm to my kids -- putting a flower in their hair every morning and giving them a lovely gift bag with candies and books at the end of our stay.

A buffet lunch under the guidance of Jerome was just what we needed then. These guys are so open and genuinely friendly.

576241304,40,"Excellent hotel, with two warnings...","I chose this because of the excellent reviews. Any time a hotel is ranked #1 on TripAdvisor, how could you go wrong?    In most respects, Prince Waikiki lives up to its reputation. It's nice and quiet - a bit far from the maddening crowds of the rest of Waikiki, but within walking distance of all the beautiful beaches. And it has excellent views overlooking the marina. The rooms are very nice and comfortable.    There are two warnings:    1) The breakfast was mediocre and overpriced, especially if you like to eat healthy and/or are vegetarian. I had the buffet, because I was really hungry, and there was almost nothing for a vegetarian to eat. (Mind you, I can eat eggs; I'm not vegan.) There's miso soup, and maybe a bit of tasteless fruit, as well as an omelette. But the quality is pretty awful for everything. And it costs nearly $40 for this!    If you are going to stay at the Prince Waikiki (which I would recommend for the rooms), go have breakfast at the Modern Hotel next door. Their breakfast is outstanding!    2) You will pay far more than you expected - They charge outrageous resort fees each day, which includes ""amenities"" like self-parking - even if you don't have a car! It's ridiculous. I know that many places in Hawaii charge resort fees, but this is especially bad, when they are already charging a ton of money for rooms.

I wanted something special as it was our first trip to Hawaii and such a special occasion. The hotel certainly lived up to our expectations. We had a free bottle of prosecco sent to our room with a personalised label and note from the Hotel Manager congratulating us, such a great touch.    We had a club room on the 31st floor with amazing views of the harbour. Room was large, comfy beds, great amenities and a good cleaning service, little things like lining all our shoes up everyday that we’d just left dotted around the room. They also do turn down service every night with chocolates and ice if needed.    We paid for access to the club lounge which is situated next to the pool. We had breakfast there every day, always plenty of choice. Cereal, pastries, fruit, meats, cheese yoghurts, toast. Then a variety of hot choices that changed daily, scrambled eggs, omelette, mini quiches etc. Was always kept topped up and fresh. They also provide snacks throughout the day plus a large variety of soft drinks, tea, coffee and wine and beer. We definitely made the most of it.    Pool area was always well maintained, it was never really very busy so never had any trouble getting a sun lounger. You can also rent the cabanas, in with the rental price you get a pizza and 2 cocktails water and also a mini bottle of sunscreen! The pool was open 24 hours but they do clean it on a daily basis later in the evening. But you can use the hot tub and pool late on into the night if you wish. It’s lovely overlooking the harbour.    We didn’t eat in the restaurant in the hotel as we were always out and about but people we spoke to who had gave it good reviews.    We liked the location, about 20 mins walk from the main buzz of Waikiki but they offer a daily free shuttle service which we used to get into Waikiki in the evening and then we’d walk back. Plenty on offer around the hotel, 10 mins to the shopping mall, a few chain restaurants 5 mins walk away. So plenty to do if you don’t want to go very far.    Staff were all really friendly and very helpful. Door / bell staff never let you open a door yourself, got you a taxi quickly and great valet service. Reception and concierge team very helpful, booked us a hire car, confirmed trip details, gave us maps and tips and info on where to go around the island. You can tell they genuinely want to help you have the best time. As mentioned already cleaning staff are great, as were the staff around the pool.

573814599,50,Deserved its reputation,"Great service, incredible view of the marina, and a very comfortable room. If I had to think of complaints I would say there's not a whole lot of drawer space so heavy packers or people staying longer than a week might need more. The hotel couldn't guarantee two beds when we reserved, and well, some people who travel together don't want to share a bed, so that was not the best. I hope they can fix that policy though they did make a note of our preference on our booking - and it did work out. Their restaurant, 100 Sails, is very good for breakfast but still overpriced. You can get something similar (authentic Hawaiian French toast or Hawaiian eggs Benedict for example) down the street for less at a place called Goofy's. What makes the hotel earn 5 stars was the concierge, especially Queenie, who helped us plan a birthday dinner. We wanted something we wouldn't find at home, and she suggested a phenomenal sushi restaurant, Katsumidori. Another staff member helped us plan a trip to the North Shore and made sure we went to Matsumoto for shave ice in Haleiwa.

573065159,50,"Perfect hotel in Waikiki, Honolulu!","We love love loved our stay at the Prince Waikiki! The hotel itself fit our needs perfectly, and the service was exceptional. About the hotel: tall high rise with beautiful views of the harbor, beach, and sunsets. It is out of the hussle and bustle of the main drag of Waikiki, but only a 15-20 minute walk there, and a 10 minute walk to the Ala Moana shopping center or the park/beach. There is a shuttle, but we found that we enjoyed the walk. Also, I appreciated the free internet, parking, and bottled water – these amenities made it feel like I wasn’t being nickle and dimed to death. Room was very clean and well serviced by housekeeping. Infinity pool was nice and never overly crowded. We used the concierge services to book a couple of tours and a car rental, and these were just charged to the room. Very convenient and helpful.    All this was great, but it was the service that would keep us coming back to this hotel. Akina, Jessica, and Robert took great care of us at the hotel restaurant, the 100 Sails. (Which, by the way, has an “Express Breakfast” option and Happy Hour which we took advantage of often – less expensive but delicious food.) Laura was very helpful at the front desk and recommended and booked a lovely dinner for us. But it was Wen at front desk, and Bernadette in the restaurant who really went above and beyond. Both made us feel as if we were invited guests in their own home. Wen gave us a beautiful room on the 29th floor, and always greeted us with a smile and asked about our daily adventures. And Bernadette wrote down a list of helpful suggestions that we followed (like buy lunch from Foodland before heading to Hanauma Bay), and she even delivered a plate of delicious chocolate-covered strawberries to our room for our anniversary!

571781989,30,"Good service overall, average stay","We stayed at Prince Waikiki for 6 nights.    If we could give ""half"" a score, I would have given it 3 1/2. The hotel location is very handy, within walking distance to Waikiki Beach (15-20mins) and Ala Moana Mall (5-10 mins).    The rooms are what we consider on par with hotels of this calibre. It is clean and tidy. The carpet was a little worn.    The check-in service was ok, and the porter (George) that brought our luggage up to the room was top notched. He got us transferred to another room to have better ocean view. He was very friendly and had great sense of humour.    The pool area is pleasant, although the pools are a little small. The service around the pool was good.    Although I get that it is common to charge a resort fee in Waikiki, I really don't understand what we are getting for this fee. The hotel explains that we get free wi-fi, tooth brush and shaving kit, a carry bag, 2 bottles of water each day, and parking for the resort fee, I thought for a hotel of this calibre most of them should be included in the nightly rate.    As for the parking, there are not enough spaces. Out of the 3 nights we hired a car, only once we could find a park. We ended up parking at the Electric vehicle park one night because there were no other parks (by the way, there was a Tesla parked at a ""normal"" carpark) and had a sign on our windscreen next day saying that we were not authorised to park at this spot (out of 5 spots reserved for EV, there were no EV parked there). The following night we still could not find a park, so ended up paying to park on the street across the road.    Reception told us we could park at another building 5 mins walk away, but we were leaving and did not want to have to carry our luggage down the road to another building.    On our last night, the room below us was obviously having a party and was quite loud beyond midnight. The hotel staff did get this sorted quickly for us.    Overall I think the hotel is good, and was a comfortable stay, but there is nothing to make us want to come back and stay here again.",Apr 2018,March 2018,Traveled as a couple,,"Hamilton, New Zealand"

570220430,40,Very pleasant stay,"Reading the reviews, people threw in the word luxury often. Concierge service doesn’t constitute luxury. However, this hotel makes up for the lack of waterfalls and foliage in its customer service and location. Bellmen, front desk staff, concierge, and waitstaff were all genuinely nice people. Rooms very clean with spectacular views.    100 Sails restaurant suited a purpose for a late meal and “included” daily breakfast. Would we pay 32.00 for the breakfast buffet had it not been included? No. Recommend ordering from the a la cart menu for all meals. Dinner we opted for seafood buffet but opted for the a la cart meal several days later. Buffet while varied was standard fare that was pretty in presentation but lacked true flavor?    Location was a huge selling point. If you want to be away from the chaos, it can be achieved here. Main views and proximity to Ala Moana beach and park was shear perfection! Evening walks to the populated areas were then rewarded by the peaceful respite of the Prince. Sleeping with the windows open allowed us to hear the ocean waves without the bar scenes.    Suggestions to management. 1)While there is not an adult only pool and there is no life guard on duty, and we found it quite disconcerting that parents would allow small children to wear water wings in the infinity pool where they would gleefully propel themselves from the immersed step to the edge of the pool giggling as the water wave spilled will force over the edge. Several times I gasped thinking the small child would potentially wash over the edge. And no the parent was not in the pool but on the deck. 2)While the pool staff was pleasant, none rounded for drinks but more importantly to clear chairs of used towels. Apparently people don’t know to clear their towels as a courtesy to the next guest but furthermore if no staff rounds, the options for seating is reduced.",Apr 2018,April 2018,Traveled as a couple,,"Aptos, California"

They had fresh fruit and of course was always sweet and delicious. Two types of cereal only but I didn’t try for it as there was other hot food to eat. But breakfast food was typically the same daily and after a few days we were kinda sick of it. They do have express breakfast with 2 eggs and toast for $5.

What a fun time - the parade was over 2 hours and watching the impressive fireworks show from Waikiki Beach was unforgettable. We stayed on the 12th floor and had a super view of the water and boat slips. The room windows slide open and we enjoyed the fresh air and breezes. **we didn't realize that when the windows are open, the A/C shuts off - makes sense but a bit confusing**    Even though the weather was fairly cool and windy, we enjoyed being down at the pool, especially the look of the infinity pool. The water was quite low in the hot tub which was a bit disappointing. Prince Waikiki is within walking distance of so much - shopping, restaurants etc...

The water-facing rooms are generous in size and provide a terrific view of the marina and ocean beyond. Especially liked the sliding windows allowing for plenty of fresh ocean breezes as an alternative to the air conditioning. The location of the hotel is perfect for those who desire separation from the bustle of the immediate Waikiki beach hotel and shopping areas. Yet, it's an easy walk to all the action, if you choose. The beautiful lobby and relaxing vibes at the pool make for a great home base from which all of the Oahu activities can be accessed. The best aspect of this hotel, however, is the staff. Can't say enough about how consistently welcoming and friendly the hotel staff are from the front door to the back room. The attitudes of the staff never felt forced or contrived. It felt genuine and is a reflection of a well-managed team, in my opinion.

565890222,40,Solid Waikiki Option - Resort fee is obnoxious,"Location: 4/5  If you're worried about this being out of the way, don't be. My 7 mos pregnant wife and I had no problem walking to shops and restaurants in Waikiki. Also, Ala Moana Park and Beach is an even shorter walk and it is not to be missed. It's one of the nicest parks I've ever visited. We never took their shuttle but there's also that option.    Staff: 5/5  Check-in staff, pool staff, etc were all excellent.    Amenities: 5/5  Room was modern and comfortable. The view of the marina and ocean was killer. The pool(s) jacuzzi and bar are all very nice. The lobby is really comfortable, has a nice shop, coffee shop, and a couple of good restaurants. Katsu Midori sushi is a must-visit. It's super authentic, excellent japanese for less than some of the tourist traps in the area.    Price: 3/5  The price is reasonable and competitive with other hotels in Waikiki. However, I was really annoyed that a $30/night resort fee is added to the bill only when you arrive. I booked my stay with points and there was a sting to have to owe an additional $60+ dollars for my two nights. It's a dirty trick and the management should immediately stop doing this. Just raise your rates. It's ridiculous to say the fee includes things like a tooth brush and a tote bag. With such a great hotel, there's no reason to be deceptive.",Mar 2018,March 2018,Traveled as a couple,"Higher floors facing the marina have a great view of ocean, beaches, marina, and sunsets.","Los Angeles, California"
565824262,50,I’m legitimately in awe.,"Prince Waikiki is perhaps my very favorite hotel of all time. This needs to be prefaced by saying that I am not easily impressed. Honolulu is by no means my dream destination, it is loud, crowded, and urban. I was not prepared for how wonderful an experience this property would provide.    We did a one night stay, pre-cruise, and asked for both early check-in and late departure. The front desk staff in a huge, beautiful lobby were gracious and friendly, helping tremendously with our moods after a red-eye from Vegas. They shuffled things a bit and told us they could have a room ready to go in a couple of hours - exceptional work with their volume of visitors. We used our time to enjoy the buffet breakfast in the third floor restaurant and wander a bit.    We got our room and we were supremely happy with view, the giant opening windows, and the layout. Then, you begin to notice the details. A great deal of thought has gone in to how best to make guests comfortable and predict then fulfill their needs. From charging ports to make-up mirrors, the room was well conceived and beautifully executed.    We spent a few hours at the pool in a cabana (half a days rent included two cocktails and a large frozen pizza - the only thing I would suggest improvement upon). The pool staff were excellent! They are friendly, and very efficient at providing excellent service.    Overall impression:  This hotel strikes the perfect balance. It is elegant without gaudy, service is given with smiles that are genuine not mandatory, rooms are spacious but not wastefully, and the entire facility is both immaculate and in perfect condition.  I would love to stay with them again, even though they are located at a destination that is not my personal favorite. If Waikiki is already your thing, this place can only improve upon your experience.",Mar 2018,March 2018,Traveled as a couple,,"Carrollton, Ohio"
565694639,50,It Will Change Your Idea of Waikiki,"Honolulu is not our favorite spot on the islands. Crowds. Traffic. Noise. Crowded beaches. However, staying at the Prince has made Honolulu actually pleasant. We stumbled upon this hotel taking a walk around the marina where we were staying at another nearby hotel that was crawling with people and tourists. We made the switch.    The Prince is a bit of peace and tranquility smack dab in the middle of Waikiki. I'm almost hesitant to write this review as the selfish part of me wants to keep this gem a secret. It's great to go to the lobby and get great coffee without lines a mile long. It's wonderful to go to 100 Sails restaurant to get a great cooked to order egg breakfast for $5 with a view of the ocean (no lines nor wait). It's a treat to not have to race to the pool at sunrise to secure a chair at the pool. No waiting forever for the elevators, either.    The only downside to this hotel is that it is not directly on the beach as it is on the marina -- and that's assuming you're a beach person. However, it's fun to watch the boats. If you want the beach there is a park within a 5 minute or so walk toward the Ala Moana center. The beach there is calm, clean, and not nearly as crowded as the other Waikiki beaches.    The staff got to know us on a first-name basis and made us feel very welcome. The 100 Sails Restaurant located within the hotel has the best happy hour ever with very affordable drinks and pupus that will not disappoint. They also have an encore happy hour later in the evening with live music on the weekends.    Our basic room was spacious and comfortable with a smart layout. The pillows were perfect (always an indicator of sleep quality). There was never noise from other guests that we heard - very quiet.    My only complaint, and I have to think really think about it, was the fitness center. For cardio there was only one treadmill and one stationary bicycle. It would be nice to have an eliptical and/or at least one more treadmill.    We are definately coming back.",Mar 2018,March 2018,Traveled with family,,"Petaluma, California"

Hotel also provided slippers, dental kit, shaving kit and bottled water which usually only provided in Asian hotels ( but the hotel staff mentioned they are covered by the resort fee). Parking is also covered in the resort fee so that’s convenient.

The rooms are modern and clean, the sea views are breathtaking, pool is nice, pity the weather was too windy many days for us to fully enjoy it. We had club access for 6 days, and while it was great for a few days we soon got sick of the similar meals displayed each day. Also we felt like we had to eat there for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Read somewhere that you have you book the club lounge for the entire stay but we were able to cancel it for the last few days no problem. Just another point of service - always going over and above. On check in we received a hand written card and banana bread. A few days later macaroons (yum!), and they also do a turn down service every night. It really is the small things that add value.

I checked in about 9:00 PM. The woman I checked in with and the two valet/luggage guys that helped me were friendly and helpful.

Although it was a long ride to the 24th floor, my room was very nice with a gorgeous view of the marina. The bathroom was huge—separate water closet, shower, bath, and vanity area.    I needed to be in Kaka'ako every day of my trip, so the location was ideal, just a ten minute drive away. The parking garage was incredibly easy to use and very convenient.

564125057,50,Everything Turned Out Great,"During many business trips to Honolulu, my wife and I have stayed at this hotel many times over the past 10 years. We have witnessed many physical changes at this hotel, but one thing that remained constant was the friendly, familiar faces and great attitudes of many of the staff. We recently had to make a last minute trip. My wife called to book our room and was told that she couldn’t make a reservation after 6:00PM local time. Weird policy, but just so you know. We ended up booking a room the day we arrived in Honolulu. That is perhaps when the issues began. We wanted a room with a king size bed. We were told they only had kings available in their “Premiere” or “Club” level, an upgrade in price. No problem. We figured the premiere level was adequate and agreed to the upgrade. When we arrived after a long work day, we pulled up to the front of the hotel. Oddly, there were no valets present. Not a big deal, but unusual. I parked my vehicle, got our bags out myself, checked in, and then returned to the vehicle. A cheerful valet greeted me and we worked everything out. Once we arrived at our room, we walked into a very nicely appointed room. Except, something seemed “off”. The room seemed oddly small. In the main room, there was only a king bed, the normal cabinets, desk, TV, and two chairs. But, there was no couch and table. The room just felt cramped. If you sign on to use the free Wi-Fi, they ask you to rate your check-in and experience thus far with the hotel. Unbeknownst to each other, both my wife and I gave honest – disappointing – reviews. Soon, I received a message on our room phone from someone assuring me that the room was indeed a Premiere room and that we just may not be familiar with the latest remodel. My wife ended up speaking with the manager and he was friendly, helpful, and surprised when my wife told him how small the room was. They suddenly realized that they had placed us in a “satellite” room next to a suite that could be used as an extra space for a larger family or for someone that just wanted to stretch out. To make up for the mistake, they moved us to a Club floor, a normal sized room with a king bed, and did all of that for us while we were at work. (We just had to pack up again and leave our bags.) When we arrived back at the hotel, we were greeted by a newly-remodeled room that was super clean, cheerful, and nicely appointed, including locally sourced soap, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and lotions. The beds were very comfortable and we finally had a nice sitting area in which we could stretch out. The floor to ceiling windows had electric sheers and shades. But more importantly, the view allowed us to look out at the marina below. We could watch surfers, sailboats, kayaks, fishermen, and yachts as they maneuvered the canal, the waves, and the ocean. We took advantage of the Club floor access – located on the 5th floor near the swimming pool. Again, the people there were super friendly. You can choose from great snacks/charcuterie/soup/fruit/chips/crackers, etc. You can help yourself to coffee, sodas, and water, and a host/hostess will pour you a decent wine or beer if you like. One of the nicest surprises for us was the discovery of a fabulous, authentic, Japanese sushi bar/restaurant located just down the hall from the front desk. We had worked late and, around 9PM dropped in. We were seated immediately at the sushi bar. The chefs were super friendly (a theme at this property), knowledgeable, talented, offered us suggestions, made whatever we asked for, and made our dining experience simply delightful. In fact, we were so pleased, we went there a second time on the night before we were scheduled to go home. Same great chefs, same great sushi, same great experience. Sorry for this long essay, but the bottom line is, this hotel is a wonderful, luxury hotel. It’s away from the crowds of Waikiki, yet within walking distance of the Ala Moana mall in one direction and the beaches of Waikiki in the other. Do not hesitate to book a room here, and the Club floor upgrade is worth it.",Mar 2018,February 2018,Traveled on business,"The higher the room, the quieter.

564035063,50,Be Treated Like Royalty at the Prince Waikiki,"The Prince Waikiki has been one of our favorite hotels in Honolulu for years. However it was showing its age. The Prince underwent a major renovation last year which included feedback and participation by its long time staff and employees. We've always said the true reflection of a hotel is not only the loyalty of its return customers, but the heart is pumped by the loyalty of its staff.    We've seen this demonstrated by the smiles of familiar faces from the bellmen and car attendants to the staff front desk and even the folks who answer the phone and work at the shops within the hotel.    I experienced the benefits of the restoration on a visit in November, and was excited to share it with my wife on this February trip. The lobby is open and magnificent. Some of the art pieces were created by the staff. The rooms are magnificent with incredible ocean views. The color palette is updated and relaxing with double power blinds to allow a view even with the bright sunsets or total blockage. We noticed some subtle but welcome touches such as the deluxe Japanese heated toilet, and my wife loved the makeup mirror that lights automatically when approached at a certain distance.    Gone is the Hakone restaurant, but in its place is the incredible Katsu Midori Sushi restaurant out of Tokyo which imports its fish, serving large generous portions at a surprisingly good price. It is located on the lobby level and replaced the smelly hair salon. The main dining room has been nicely updated with many tasty items for breakfast ala cart or on their buffet. Again it was so comforting to see many of the same staff who gave us a warm greeting.    The pool and deck have received a welcome and refreshing facelift as well. The cute little bar is gone, and the quick breakfast snack shop has been changed, but we miss the croissant sandwiches.

562604023,40,Splurge hotel,"We booked early and received a good rate. Our room was pretty high up, on the boat view side of the building. Daily, each morning we were woken by trucks backing up, the beeping carries up the building, even with the windows shut.    Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. The artwork is beautiful. The bathroom products were a great touch, as well as the 2 complimentary bottles of water, each day of our stay.    The room was beautifully arranged, king size bed, couch sectional in the corner, tv/dresser with a desk at the end. With ceiling to floor windows, screen and light blocking shade.    The light switch by the door controls 2 lamps in the room. The bathroom was interesting, heated toilet seat, nice shower and a bathtub.    What was missing was additional hangers and a place to unpack and put our clothes away. We ended up using the ironing board in the closet, to layout clean clothes.    The hotel caters to out non-US visitors, which are polite, but never say thank you when you hold the door for them.    With the price of the room, one would expect discounted rates at the 100 Sails restaurant, however the breakfast buffet was $34/person, the food was good, but the price was extremely high...for breakfast.    On the evening we arrived we had a late dinner there too, waitstaff were friendly and kept pushing the buffet, which we skipped, for actual plated items.    The coffee bar on the first floor, has yummy smoothies, cookies, coffee and breakfast bowls (acia bowl with oats).    The gift shop sells food too, bottled drinks, candy, snacks and souvenirs. Easy place to pick up a cold beverage.    The room was nice, however being in property management, you can tell they cut corners on the hotel. During a very heavy rainfall, the elevators leaked water on ever floor it opened to, the wallpaper wasn't set correctly in the bathrooms...a few little things to improve on.    Checking out was slow, three desks and only 2 people helping. Valet were friendly, polite and helpful.

This is a Japanese-run hotel and many Japanese folks stay here. It’s rare to hear anyone talking in the hallways and I’ve never heard another human voice through the walls. I’m a very light sleeper and I always dread sleeping in a hotel room and being surrounded by loud talkers. The new lobby is artsy, spacious with a great gift shop and café. Pool area is gorgeous and never crowded. There are now two great restaurants: sushi and fine dining. I highly recommend the seafood buffet at 100 Sails: $58 for unlimited sashimi and sushi, crab legs and prime rib plus a good selection of Asian sides, soups and desserts.    If you’re looking for a quiet, peaceful oasis you should consider this excellent hotel that’s located on the Ala Moana side of Waikiki beach.

It is really, really schmick! They’ve paid great attention to detail. Paint, fittings, fixtures, it’s all great.    Room: Stayed on 31st floor (there’s 33) due to opting in to the Prince Waikiki Club (more on this later). Rooms don’t have balconies/terraces, but don’t need them. Floor to ceiling widows with a huge double window that slides fully open more than makes up for it. The electric blinds are a nice luxury touch, too. Day bed built into the corner of room is also great. Bed super comfy & pillows are very nice. Bathroom is well done. Marble tiles/countertop dominate, with frosted glass cubicle doors for shower & toilet.  Club: The space is great, with indoor & outdoor seating, overlooking the marina. Food & beverage range is good, although wine & beer are on-tap only & choice is limited here. Oddly, we were asked to return our dirty dishes & glasses to the servery, so that the staff could then clear them away. Would’ve thought with the extra price tag to use the Lounge that the staff might clear away my plates and glasses.  Pool area is good, and lounges are available on a first come basis. There’s no shade available unless you rent one of the lanai’s - having to pay for shade is a bit cheeky.  If you don’t have the need to be right in the thick of it at Waikiki (it’s a decent 20 minutes walk to central Waikiki) you could do a whole heap worse than stay at this great hotel.",Feb 2018,February 2018,Traveled as a couple,,"Melbourne, Australia"

558839688,50,Prince Waikiki... we chose well!,"On short notice we decided to visit Oahu. We had flights, rental car and now needed a hotel. We booked at several places, each one had a flaw revealed during further investigation that caused us to move on. We finally looked closely at the Prince Waikiki. The reservation agent was great and pointed out several reasons to upgrade to the club level. This gave us access to a lounge where wine, beer and food was available all day long.  Check in was easy and we were taken to one of the highest floors in the hotel. When the door opened there was incredible sunlight in the room. Luckily there was a wonderful shade system to control the glare and darken the room at night to sleep. It was late afternoon and we had just finished an 11 hour flight. We went down to the club room and enjoyed wine and beer and some food. We decided to crash for the night. Around 8:00 we were awakened by fireworks. Our view was perfect for the Friday night spectacle.  The next night we attended an event at the hotel where local restaurants served small plates and there was live music. We upgraded to VIP to be guaranteed a seat and an early admission. While some of the food was tasty, there was no way this was worth the price. We left early.  The entire stay was just perfect. Imagine returning to the hotel and have the valet parking people greet you by name and ask how your trip to .... was. They remembered!  The pool is very nice, on the 5th floor. There is a main pool and an infinity pool overlooking the marina. There is a bar and the waitstaff were excellent. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants in the hotel, but they were all busy.

Close to all the buzz and life of Waikiki but yet an island sanctuary, where you feel in your own little world.    The place unlike other places I've stayed in Waikiki gives you an authentic rejuvenating Hawaiian experience. Prince Waikiki felt non-touristy and I loved how I could sleep with the windows open to hear the ocean. Other beachfront places I've stayed in Waikiki, I've had to sleep with windows and doors closed due to beach and bar noise pollution. I loved how the staff were always there when you needed them but not in your face. Helped me to finally relax into my Hawaiian holiday.    On our first night we enjoyed a sunset dinner in a private cabana on the pool deck. Not only was the scenery and ambience incredible but the food and service exceptional. We ate fresh healthy mouth watering food under the stars, with outstanding non-intrusive service. The meal started with a fish taco appetiser. Beetroot salad followed as an entree. For the main I had beautiful fresh fish while my partner had steak and lobster. The meal finished in Hawaiian class with a decadent strawberry shaved ice dessert. We finished the night with a spa and swim under a full moon. It really doesn't get better then that.    The resort goes above and beyond. At the end of each day we would come back to our room cleaned to perfection and every night we were given a gift. They don't take any shortcuts. Robes, slippers, linen, beds, pillows everything is of the highest quality.    If you're wanting an authentic hawaiian experience in luxury close to everything but far enough to be able to relax, rejuvenate do it. Go. Visit this magical gem in the heart of hawaii.

We were able to walk to the Hilton next door and wanted around their property as well. Loved that the windows opened to give you the balcony feel without the balcony. The room was very modern and the sunset view was incredible.    Some things I wish were different that took a star from my rating: the shower never got hot enough. The hot water from the sink was hotter. There wasn’t a lot of storage space so I never got to really unpack and get comfortable. The service at the pool was a bit lacking. Several times the waiter would walk by and not even ask if we wanted anything and the water was a bit cold.    Pluses: location, loved the toiletries, the view, the pool was cool (2 pools, one was an infinity pool looking out to the ocean), the coffee shop in the lobby was great ( try the Hawaiian latte), the staff we met were all very friendly!

We really liked the location - I wanted to do some shopping and being so close to Ala Moana was great. We also went to the Ward Centre to see some movies there but that is a longer walk.  Wifi is very good as well.  The coffee shop in the lobby downstairs is excellent - made the best coffee we had in Hawaii.  My only complaint is the resort fee added to your bill. This is not optional and in effect lets the hotel charge you a higher rate for your room, rather than the advertised rate. It is said to include such things as wifi and the gym, shuttle bus and free parking. Most hotels in the US provide wifi, gym and a shuttle on a complimentary basis. We did not have a car so the only really valuable extra was not something we could use.

The room service was reasonably priced and very friendly, even our pool server Sam was lovely!    I have stayed in many hotels in Waikiki from the Hilton Hawaiian Village, the Hilton to the Aston's but hands down the new Prince Waikiki is the best. The service is top-notch. The restaurants are delicious. The decor is beautiful and the rooms are modern with Gorgeous views. To top it all off the price is just right, if not a bargain!

And as you leave, don't forget to ask the staff for beach towels and chairs! They will happily provide you with some for your daily activities.    Inside their hotel and up the escalators hides an amazing restaurant, 100 Sails. Their menu selection is unique and gives you a taste of Hawaii. From their tropical drink menu to their seafood and salad selections.    You can hangout by the pool, and order yourself some drinks by the bar. My favorite was the 'Prince Charming' cocktail, it is fruity with a kick. The pool deck had not one but two pools! One inner pool and one infinity pool facing the ocean. Book yourself a cabana and enjoy a full day on deck watching the sunset.    To be honest, it was a little hard to leave the room because they had the best sunsets! You are directly in front of the ocean. Slide those windows open and smell that fresh ocean air! No wonder it was so hard to leave.    Book your next stay here and you won'tn regret it!

556175276,50,My Favorite Resort in Waikiki,"I'm finally back again at my favorite hotel in Oahu and I'm so glad I got to celebrate my late birthday here with great friends and company. I always feel so welcomed when I enter this hotel, the staff are so friendly and always ready to help you when you need assistance. The second I step into this hotel, I instantly feel relaxed and at ease. The spacious lobby with high ceilings and outstanding pieces of art and design gives me feelings of comfort and luxury at the same time. When checking in, the concierge handed us welcome towels to cool down our faces and hands.    Another reason I love this hotel are the beautiful rooms. I stayed in the stunning Ocean Front Suite which had a living room as long with a master bedroom and another ocean front room which connected from the other side. The view from this room is spectacular and once you open the wide windows, you can see the view of the dock and the beach as well. This suite is truly luxurious and I was really able to enjoy my vacation staying in this suite. On top of that, the bed was one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on. I fell asleep in an instant.    The hotel pool area is also one of the highlights of this hotel. My favorite is watching the sunset from the pool area, it is definitely a sight to see. The sky turns into cotton candy skies. I also love the design of the pool area. There are beautiful white cabanas surrounding the pool that you can reserve. We had the pleasure of enjoying lunch from 100 Sails in one of the cabanas and also enjoyed dinner at the pool deck as well. Another feature of the pool area is a stunning infinity pool along the side of the hotel. I love just hanging out in the infinity pool because you get an incredible view, just like the one I can see from my suite.    As mentioned before, I had the pleasure of enjoying both lunch and dinner from 100 Sails (the hotel's main restaurant and bar) at the pool area and let me just say, I am never disappointed eating here. It was just as good as the last time eating here.    For lunch we had poke (my fave!), octopus tacos, truffle fries, mushroom flatbread, and a baked brie. For dinner we had 5 courses. For our first course we had a seafood platter with Kona lobster, ahi, Kau'l shrimp, poached kona lobster, grilled tako legs with pesto. Everything on this plate was so delicious! I wanted more! For our second course we had beet salad. For our third course we had wagyu beef and black truffle ravioli. It was nothing like I've ever had before, but it was so tasty. For our fourth course we enjoyed a sous vide Colorado lamb with yukon gold puree, and glass potato chips. This dish was perfect. The chips had a nice crunch to it and went so well with the lamb. The fifth course was a chocolate raspberry mousse chocolate cake topped with raspberry meringue, raspberry coulis, chocolate sheet, chocolate twist, and freeze dried strawberry crumb. It was one of the best desserts I've ever had in my life.",Jan 2018,January 2018,Traveled with friends,The suites are large and sunny with a great view,"San Diego, California"

555972642,40,Beware of “Ocean Front”,"Our stay was excellent. BUT, I was told on the phone when I booked that if I paid more for the ""Ocean Front"" room that we would be able to watch the sunsets. Unfortunately, that was not the case as the sliver of ocean viewable from our suite didn't offer a spec of sunset, and when the windows were open all we could hear were traffic sounds and sirens. (I'll try and attach a photo.) The front desk said that it's still technically ocean front and anything more is an upgrade. While disappointing, it didn't harm our stay. Otherwise, a wonderful time at a top-notch hotel that's far enough away from the hustle of Waikiki beach but close enough that you could walk to it if you wanted.

555719791,50,The kind of experience I save my 5 star reviews for,"Family members treated us to a room here for our annual(-ish) Hawai'i vacation. We were graciously welcomed and given a room on the 23rd floor in the Diamond Head tower. All rooms have a remarkable view of the marina and ocean, and spectacular sunsets. The room was incredibly comfortable, with excellent A/C (something we have had 'challenges' with in many other Oahu hotels) as well as a huge window which opens up to let the fresh air in. ) The large bathroom has a big comfortable soaking tub, and separate shower with an adjustable shower head and great water pressure. The bath supplies are by Maile, a luxury local brand. Tea kettle, glasses and coffee supplies as well as mini fridge are discreetly tucked in the bureau cabinets. Our king-bed room also had a sizable corner sofa and plenty of closet space complete with generously sized robes and terry slippers. The bed was comfortable and there was an extra pillow in the closet. Turn down service was nice to return to after dinner- a nice card with local nature facts and chocolates left on the bed, as well as a full ice bucket, and freshening up of the room. The decor is modern and up to date, in tasteful Hawaiian decor with neutral colors and subtle textures. I didn't try the coffee packets as the Honolulu Coffee Roaster co. has a cafe in the lobby where they sell outstanding coffee drinks. We didn't try the Japanese restaurant but it seemed to be popular. We had the dinner buffet (twice), at the 100 Sails restaurant which featured crab legs, prime rib, sashimi and many other delicious entrees. The service was great, and the food was amazing. Check in and check out both went smoothly and quickly, not too long of a wait. The lobby was spotless and gleaming, and had a really nice ambience with local art installations and plenty of light and space. The gym had some decent cardio machines and a lanai to relax on to enjoy fresh air after exercising. The swimming pools were pristine and gently heated, perfect for an early morning swim. Easy walk to Ala Moana beach park, and Ala Moana mall for shopping if thats your thing- we went for cheap lunches and quick meals when we weren't doing things in other areas of the island. There are shuttles available as well. This is a beautiful newly renovated hotel with amazing staff, I can't say enough positive things about what a great experience we had staying here.

I could actually feel the coldness when I got there so different as it wasn't that way pre-renovation. We stayed a suite which is costly since no Kamaina deals, I took my family to dinner at the 100 sails which is on property , I was told when I made the reservation after holding for 10 minutes that I would get the senior prices on the seniors that were in my party, when it came time to pay the bill I was told because of the holiday they weren't honoring the prices. the saving grace was from the housekeeping staff, who came to fix the plugged up sink , and the housekeeper who was the only constant thing that saved them.

But the room is clean and comfortable. The layout for a one bedroom suite is great for a young family - two bathrooms with a separating wall allowing for kids not to be disrupted by adults sleeping a bit later. The view is great as we are on the high floors. The staff - from everyone - is always warm, courteous and welcoming (sure, there is one that doesn't smile whenever he comes in to help bring us stuff every other night, but no complaint...).

554668121,40,Down a Star,"I stayed at the Prince Waikiki last January, on tail end of its renovation, and thought it had what it takes to be a 4 star hotel. So I happily booked the Prince again to see if it had lived up to the potential. Sadly, it didn't.    The Good :  The Prince is a lovely hotel that has some of the best views in Waikiki and coziest beds. The turn-down service is thoughtful, with chocolates accompanied by a note about the Hawaiian culture swapped out every pm (the one that talked about petroleum was a bit odd tho). The room decor is ls soothing, with modern furnishings, hand-painted wallpaper and multifunction Toto toilet/bidets.    The Bad :  The standard of morning housekeeping is bare minimum. I had hairs & sand leftover in my shower from the previous occupant when I checked-in. As an experiment, I didn't move or clean them and they remained for almost the entirety of my stay. One day I got back to my room at 3:00 to find it hadn't been touched; I called housekeeping and was accused(?!!) of having the Do Not Disturb sign out (it hadn't been). They then sent someone to quickly straighten up but really? I had out of the room since 8am...    The concierges are among the least experienced I've ever encountered. When asked about new or different places, they were totally uninformed and was directed to the old standards. Heck, they still recommend cabs, not Lyft, Uber or even the very dependable TheBus. Luckily I know how/where to go so if you've been to Oahu before, don't depend on them.    The Multi-Cultural :  The Prince is booked by large Japanese tour groups, with the dominant guest population that. For me, no biggie but might be for others...    Synopsis :  Would I stay at the Prince again? Probably not.  It didn't feel special, like it had on my last visit, and there was an air of resignation among the staff. The one exception would be Alicia, a housekeeper who had been on my floor previously; I was greeted with a warm ""welcome back"" by her and wish she had been assigned to my floor again.

Weeks ahead of the special day, my wife and daughter selected several different hotels offering Kama'aina (local) rates with ocean views to check out. The Prince Waikiki was the only one that went above and beyond in showing them one of the rooms and the hotel property, so we made a reservation.    On the big day, we pulled up to the hotel and were warmly and promptly greeted by one of the hotel staff at the curb. I was given a ticket for valet parking, but when I said I was going to do self-parking there was no change whatsoever in the employee's demeanor as I had expected. He continued to help unloading our luggage and give me great instructions on getting to the garage and where to park.    Upon check-in the desk, our reservation was in order and everything about the hotel's amenities including free shuttle service to nearby shopping and the beach were fully explained. We headed up to our room and were told our bags would follow shortly. About 15 minutes later, the bellman arrived with our luggage and the great service continued as he offered to show us how to operate the electric blinds and other features about the room.    Our room had a great view of the Ala Wai Boat Harbor, Magic Island and the ocean. The windows even opened up to enjoy the fresh air. The room was well-stocked with personal amenities including bath robes. It had a separate bathtub and shower, refrigerator, large flat screen TV, and the bottom drawer of the dresser had a combination push-button lock that served as a safe at no charge.    We did not make use of the hotel's onsite dining, but did frequent the pool and make use of the free shuttle service. Aside from a noisy guest in the adjacent room our first night, we had a great weekend stay. The hotel staff were very courteous and professional and the hotel room and common areas were exceptional. We'll definitely return.",Jan 2018,November 2017,Traveled with family,,"Aiea, Hawaii"

Five star quality rooms, and facilities, and exceptional staff!","I have stayed at at least five other hotel properties in Waikiki over the years; anywhere from $$-$$$, and I must say that Prince Waikiki was absolutely the best value thus far.    The last stay, 5 nights and 6 days, was truly ideal:  It was easy to book through hotel's reservation system, special requests were met without any hassles, professional and smooth check-in, and great bell/valet service. Given that we were travelling near NYE & NYD, hotel restaurant reservation was easily accessible and reasonable unlike other places. Food service is superb- coming from NYC, we are hard to impress, but excellent in value and quality.  Poolside cabanas are also reasonably priced which we took advantage of a couple of days, and three pools are all very nice.  THE ROOMS!!! are exceptional- I was a bit hesitant when I saw pictures, but unfortunately, the pictures do not do JUSTICE! They are newly renovated, furnished, and updated.

My mom made good use of the complimentary shuttle service, and concierge promptly responds to questions via email and go above and beyond.

This hotel is very family friendly and seems to cater to Japanese weddings! Two minor quibbles 1) the pool area is pleasant and relaxed but on the small side -- during our stay, it quickly filled up with kids/families (to be expected during the ""high season"" - but worth keeping in mind if your traveling as a couple; and 2) it would be nice to have more outdoor dining options on the premises - food service at the pool bar is limited and the bar closes at 7 pm.",Jan 2018,December 2017,Traveled as a couple,All rooms have an ocean view but high floors are exceptionally scenic,"Portland, OR"

This is the first hotel you will pass by if you are going downtown or towards the famous Waikiki beach. It faces a marina with lots of boats being anchored and all the hotel rooms face the sea. The features worth a mention are electric shades for windows, Japanese toilets for the ablutions and outstanding service by the staff everywhere. We reached at 8.30am and were assigned a room promptly. It's location is perfect - quiet from the hustle bustle of the Waikiki beach, diagonally across from Alana Moana Shopping centre, close to go catching a shuttle to Waikele shopping complex and public transport to visit Pearl Harbour ( make it a point to visit full of recent history). Another noteworthy point is when paying gratuities staff is happy with what one gives.

On Friday nights there is a firework show that happens five mins- walking distance to the beach and it was a close view of the fireworks for New Years and Friday Night fireworks.

It's not right in the main stretch of Waikiki which I believe is a good thing to be away from the throngs of tourists (walking distance and free shuttles available). The pool deck is great (main pool and infinity pool), with one negative -- the (smallish) hot tub was CONSTANTLY filled with kids, in my experience hotels don't allow that. We went for a high floor and club access, worth it in my opinion for breakfast, drinks and snacks all day, and a private deck right next to the pool.",Dec 2017,January 2018,Traveled as a couple,,"NYC, NY"

Main Honolulu shopping streets are located maybe 15-20 min walking distance  * Very nice (if small) infinity pool, overlooking the marina  * Decent size main pool and hot tub    A few drawbacks:  * No air conditioning in the corridors (available in the rooms, lifts and lobby), so they can get hot  * Breakfast buffet is expensive  * Wifi seems to be chargeable, but we got it for free  * Despite asking when booking to get 2 separate beds, the first room assigned had a single bed, forcing us to go back down to reception (after a very long journey)  * They made a mistake on the final bill (charged more than the agreed rate), and it took several emails to get a reply and get it corrected    Conclusion: we would absolutely stay again at the Prince Waikiki, but we would double check the bill before leaving.",Dec 2017,October 2017,Traveled as a couple,,"London, United Kingdom"

We loved the free shuttle to Ala Moana mall (and to Waikiki) and used it when we had shopped so long that our feet needed a break.

549868946,30,Nice view .. everything else ok,"Clean lobby, friendly staff but for the price the value is not great. I stayed in the hotel for 6 nights. Initially my room was on the diamond head tower and the view was just of harbor and some ocean. I was not impressed and shared the feedback. Immediately Claire from the lobby staff responded and offered me the room on the 21 floor of the ala Moana tower with much better view. She was kind enough to give the keys and told us to take time to move our things. They also offered a champagne as my wife and I were celebrating our wedding anniversary during our stay. The rooms are clean. The bathrooms are big and luxury. Everything else is okay. There is a resort fee of $30 plus dollars for each day of your stay which includes self car parking and couple of water bottles/ day. If you don’t have a car you still have to pay the resort fee. Be prepared to pay $5 delivery fee and 17% surcharge for every inroom service. I really hope the staff gets the majority if not all of the 17% surcharge. For a bowl of rice be prepared to pay close to $10. I have stayed in many luxury resorts before but none have charged me for every small service.

548292076,50,Prince Waikiki - Updated and Fresh,"I was a long-time patron of the Hawaii Prince, so I had mixed feelings when I heard they were renovating because I thought it was still a great, modern place to stay. Needless to say, I am happy with the changes. They kept a lot of what was great (the friendly service, the fast glass door elevators with a view, the floor to ceiling glass walls that give you an unbelievable ocean view, and the separate shower/tub bathroom, bathrobes and comfy slippers) and updated the décor, the furnishings and a HD flatscreen TV. I was bewildered by the new toilet, having never used a bidet-style toilet before which I believe are prevalent in Japan. Once I figured out how to use it, I think I want one for myself! And the POOL . . . they added a little infinity pool section for an awesome view overlooking the harbor. Loved the automatic window shades and the corner sofa sectional. Electrical outlets with USB ports. All in all, I enjoyed my stay at the Prince Waikiki and it will remain my first option of hotels to book when traveling to Honolulu for business or pleasure.",Dec 2017,December 2017,Traveled as a couple,,"Maui, Hawaii"

Check in was quick in the open and airy lobby. Upon reaching my 14th floor room, I found a nicely decorated, good sized room with 2 double beds as I requested. The bathroom was really nice with separate tub and stand up shower and the toilet in a separate room. The view over the harbor was breath taking and offered constantly changing views provided by Mother Nature.    Over the weekend, this property provided excellent, friendly and helpful service.

We rode the complimentary shuttle back, which was really convenient. This time we were on the 10th floor and noticed that it was somewhat noisy during the night, so a higher floor would probably take care of that.

It’s a bit far from the center of Waikiki which was good for us, because we prefer staying in quiet areas. They offer a free shuttle service to the main Waikiki strip, but we used an Uber. It was inexpensive, easy & fast. Plus, we got a lot of useful tips and information from the local drivers.    The views from the room, glass elevator, and pool area were fantastic. I saw double rainbows from the elevator once! We watched the Hilton fireworks from our room.    One of the best parts of our Hawaii trip was Prince Waikiki. We really enjoyed our stay.

Pros:  - Close to everything (Ala Moana Center, Waikiki, International Market, Iolani Palace, etc.)  - Honolulu Coffee Company in the lobby  - Bathroom was spacious with separate shower from bathtub  - Great service  - Wifi was fast and easy to use  - Onsite parking (both valet and self)    Cons:  - Water pressure in shower was good not great  - Self parking was often full so you had to pay for valet ($8 extra)  - Very little cabinet space/drawers",Dec 2017,December 2017,Traveled as a couple,,"Menlo Park, California"

546287062,50,Hidden Gem,"This hotel isn’t on the main Waikiki strip so isn’t ‘right in the action’ however it is about a 15 minute walk there, or only a 5 minute walk to Ala Moana shopping centre. The hotel has a shuttle bus that takes you down to Waikiki as well as Ala Moana (so you can walk there and catch it back with all your shopping!) so everything is still accessible. There are still eating options around, but not as many as right on the Waikiki strip, and two ABC stores close by.    I moved from the Hyatt Regency due to noisy rooms there and no sleep – the rooms at the Prince are nice and new, and clean, and so much quieter – and all have a beautiful view of the marina. The pool area was great and not overcrowded, although I am not sure if the advertised ‘happy hour’ existed as I was charged full price for my cocktail in the time period.    Was comparatively priced to the Hyatt (for the dates I was travelling – this may not always be the case so check) once you added in the Hyatt’s daily resort fee to their room rate. The Prince does not charge this and has a few added extras such as complimentary water and bed turn down with chocolates.

545349396,50,Our new go-to hotel while visiting Oahu,"On our previous numerous trips to Oahu, we've stayed predominantly at the Ala Moana Hotel. This time, we decided to stay at the Prince because of a great kama`aina special and the larger renovated rooms (since we would be staying for 11 nights, we wanted to feel more comfortable). We're so glad we made the switch to the Prince. From being greeted at the door, easy check-in, beautiful renovated rooms with awesome views of Ala Moana Beach and Magic Island, friendly staff, etc., we had a great time. The rooms are much more spacious than what we would have gotten at the Ala Moana Hotel. The bathroom includes a separated toilet, shower, and tub, which is great for getting ready in the morning and not having to wait while your spouse is in the bathroom. The room includes a nice comfy king size bed, a smaller L-shaped couch, small desk, and nice sized flat-screen (with Chromecast - I was able to stream Netflix and YouTube from my phone). There are also automatic shades, one a lighter shade, and the other a black-out shade. Our special rate included free self-parking and at times the lot was completely full, but we were able to park in the first floor valet section. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants in the hotel but heard that they're pretty good. There are nearby restaurants including McDonald's, Red Lobster, and Outback Steakhouse. We also caught the Pink Line Waikiki Trolley into Waikiki ($2.00 per person one way) from in front of the Ilikai. It's a great deal as parking can be expensive in Waikiki. It's also an easy ten minute walk to Ala Moana Shopping Center.

544673148,50,"Excellent Accommodations, Service, and Meals","The view from my oceanside room was outstanding. I couldn't believe how breathtaking it was to look out over the marina at the sunset each evening, or to see the fireworks display over the water at night. The hotel's interior was clean, modern, and elegant. As soon as you walk into the lobby, you know this hotel is plush as the carpeted area is clearly cushioned by what must be memory foam padding. Your feet sink into the floor as though they've rested upon a cloud after a long day.    The room was sparklingly clean, the bed was comfortable, and all of the room amenities you could need were at your fingertips. In lieu of a mini-bar, there is a mini-fridge which is more welcome to me as I can use it to store my preferred food and beverages.    I had a problem using my TV, but within a few minutes of calling housekeeping to have someone assist me with it, a hotel maintenance worker arrived to reset the system and I was able to catch up on the latest episode of my favorite show.    The front desk clerks were efficient, and able to answer every question I had, including how long it would take to arrive at the airport from the hotel so I could gauge my checkout time.    The best part of my stay at Prince Waikiki was the service provided to me by the excellent chefs of 100 Sails. I have Celiac Disease which means I absolutely cannot eat gluten. Even slight cross contamination can make me sick. I spoke with a chef at the beginning of each meal, and they were able to adjust items on the menu, or create their own dishes tailored to my needs. I cannot being to tell them how grateful I am for their generosity with their time, and the care with which they fed me. I know a kitchen is a busy place as I have spent time in them myself, so their willingness to make something just for me was truly a gift.

The hotel staff members, both the front desk, gift shop and concierge, were especially helpful orienting me to Honolulu and Waikiki.    The room was spacious, clean and just luxurious! Great view. A relaxing place to return at the end of the day.    Beautiful rooftop (5th floor) infinity pool!    There is a Honolulu Coffee Company in the lobby with great coffee and baked goods and the best staff! (My favorite location.)    Lobby gift shop and convenience store is complete and really nice! Have a POG juice for me!    The hotel also includes free parking!    There is a daily resort fee but there is a resort fee pretty much everywhere these days. Not a big deal and, again, parking is included!    Nearby Tips:    Goofy Cafe nearby is excellent and a short walk from the hotel!    The Shirokiya Japan Village Walk, a market style food court at the end of the nearby Ala Moana Mall (you can cut through the mall to get there) is a do not miss experience!

We booked a two bedroom suite on the Club floor. Cheaper to book directly than through Costco! The Club was a private VIP lounge with breakfast, lunch and afternoon snacks. The assigned concierge attended to our every need, including checkout. Everyday we had a peaceful breakfast with ocean view and an occasional rainbow. This included wine and beer. We also overlooked the pool.  Nearly every room in the hotel enjoys what would have been an upgraded view at any other hotel. The pool is lovely and quiet, and the guests are all very polite.

The bed was comfortable and I loved that we had a separate sitting area. I would have wanted another chair to eat alongside my hubby but we made it work. We bought water for our room but they provide 2 free bottles per day, which is so thoughtful!    I had to ship some belongings and they provided us with a box and shipping slip.

541794166,30,Disappointed in the Prince brand,"This trip was the first time I had ever stayed at any Prince hotels. Before arriving in Hawaii I had stayed at their Tokyo hotel and was equally disappointed.    The Prince Hawaii was an okay hotel. Aside from the views, there was very little that had the hotel stand out. I paid for one of the highest level suites at the hotel and no one even took me up to the room and explained the features of the room such as the automated blinds. I spent 15 minutes one night just trying to figure out where the controls were.    The pool area was not as nice as other hotels that I have stayed at in Hawaii and the hotel did not offer things on site such as snorkeling or paddle boarding, yet they still charged a $30+ per day resort fee, which didn't make sense.    I was also frustrated because I was misquoted the cost of a private driver to pick me up from the airport. First they said that it would be $80, then the concierge called me back numerous times quoting different prices and the price I was finally charged was almost double the initial price and was not what was quoted.    The driver who did wind up picking me up didn't even have water in the car.    The floor to ceiling windows were nice in the room and did offer a wonderful view. I found some of the hotel staff to be warm and helpful, but unfortunately that was not the case with all of the staff.    One highlight was that the hotel a few blocks away (the Hilton Village) offered free fireworks on Friday night, which were pretty great. There was also a cool club next door at the Modern.    For the price I paid though and the type of hotel I thought I was staying at, I felt that the experience fell short of my expectations.",Nov 2017,November 2017,Traveled solo,,"Los Angeles, California"

What can I say -No words can describe the personalized service and awesome hospitality we both received from every staff member at the hotel, and at it’s restaurant 100 sails, where we had a fantastic buffet breakfast each morning. Prior to the Prince stay, we were bitterly disappointed with a hotel in the middle of the Waikiki strip we stayed at for the 7 days prior.    The location is great away from the hustle and bustle of the main Waikiki Beach drag, but still only a 10 minute walk to Waikiki Beach. The pool area is pristine and with its new infinity pool, is in my opinion, the perfect combination, along with having a cocktail or beer, and seeing in anticipation, the most spectacular and world renowned sunsets of Honolulu.

Pool is much quieter than reports of other resort pools. Sushi restaurant was great, but make reservations to avoid a wait. 100 Sails was delicious, but this was also reflected in the price (though still recommend eating there - well worth it!).    Overall, I would highly recommend this for anyone looking for a quieter stay at Waikiki.

All the problems are still there: Rattling doors, caused by winds coming from the elevator shaft, keep you awake at night. The service level is still low. The reception clerk made his job, no smile, no aloha, no welcome, and so did the pool staff and housekeeping. The room was never made before 3 pm, the toiletries included not even cotton swabs or pads, no opportunity to prepare a coffee in the room and so on. Somewhat disturbing is the fact that the elevators can be used by anyone at any time, even if the hotel states the room key is needed. The pool area is very clean and could be a nice place, but unfortunately there is no shade, apart from the rental cabanas. The icing on the cake was an increased room rate for 3 nights by check out.

Besides the king bed with chic beige linen bedskirt, there’s plenty of room for a large desk/eating area and a cool modular seating area.  The room is done in peaceful sand colored neutrals with splashes of blue. Beach!  The bathroom is a dream. A large modern vanity area allows two persons to get ready at same time. Separate showers and tub. Private Japanese-style toilet with bidet features behind a frosted glass door.  The hotel seems committed to eco values with the usual “don’t change my linens” card “plus separate recycling/trash box, and single cup of coffee without the plastic Keurigs.

We paid for club level and the private lounge overlooking the harbor was luxurious and swanky.

I enjoyed ocean view from 17th floor, spacious room, ability to open window wide, and clean and neat housekeeping. Hospitality at front desk and throughout the lobby was good.    If you don't want to be disturbed, be sure to put out the DND sign. After a long day of travel, I went to bed around 8:00 p.m. A few minutes later, housekeeping knocked to turn down bed and ask if I needed anything, nice but I was almost asleep. I yelled from my bed ""no thanks"" and back to sleep. 30 minutes later hospitality knocked, I yelled again ""no thanks."" The person knocked again, so I got up, put bathrobe on, and looked through peep hole to see person holding a tray with small plate of sliced cake/bread. I opened door, said thanks, and then put out DND sign. For the next 2 nights I made sure to put the DND sign.

Queenie also shared some of her personal favorite places including one for sushi, the Big Island cookies and shaved ice. She went above and beyond to make our trip extraordinary.

Check-in: Check-in and check-out were both quick and smooth. No one offered to help take our bags when we checked in, but this was actually perfectly fine for us!    The room (Ocean Harbour Room) was quite nice, with a large king sized bed and a decent sized bathroom (with separate shower and bath). The bed was so comfortable!!! Had a great sleep here! We were given a room on Floor 7, so we didn't have the great views some other reviewers spoke about. We were also overlooking the pool area, so you can hear kids laughing in the morning. Otherwise the room was nice and quiet.    There's daily housekeeping (topping up your free 2 bottles of water) and evening turn-down services (offering chocolates, shaver, toothbrushes and a fabric bag). The pool is on Level 5 and overlooks the harbour (and a car park, so it's not breathtaking).    Location-wise, it's not the best, about a 20 minute walk from the main Waikiki strip. It's close to the Ala Moana shopping centre though, about a 5 minute walk. But there is a Honolulu Coffee shop in the lobby and a small gift shop/convenience store which is handy. There's also an ABC Superette across the road.    We booked direct on the Prince Waikiki website to save on the resort fee and have access to free parking in the adjoining multi-storey car park (not sure if you get that with other booking sites too, but that was one of the supposed selling points on booking direct). Free wi-fi is included as well.

We have been to Oahu at least 8 previously times over several decades and this visit was stop over to another destination. Anyhow, the room we had was a ""run of the ocean"" and had a great view of Ala Moana beach. The room size was generous for this location. Although this hotel does not have direct beach access, there is a shuttle to Waikiki Beach and also to Ala Moana both are a 10 min walk away. Ala Moana is a much more pleasant beach to swim in, less tourist and more family oriented. The was water also much more calm due to the breakwater. We ate once at the hotel breakfast buffet which was excellent, with lots of fresh tropical fruit, egg dishes and also Asian style breakfast with congee and noodles.

Personally I like this area (at the ""edge of Waikiki"") much more than being smack dab in the middle of it all. It's easy enough to walk into Waikiki proper, yet far enough that you feel like you're getting away from the crowds. Also quite easy to walk to Ala Moana beach, Ala Moana Mall, and the Hilton lagoon area.    Probably the highlight was hanging out at the infinity pool and watching the sunset. Also got up the next morning and used the main pool and the infinity pool again.

532814403,50,Don't Waste Your Time Considering Anywhere Else,"Plenty of hotels in Waikiki are competing for your business. None can be better than Prince Waikiki--take it from someone who has traveled around the world and stayed in more than her share of hotels across the globe.    Overall, here is what I loved about Prince: it not only offered what many other accommodations lack, it gives you far and away the best of that item. For example, let's talk about applying cosmetics or shaving. Many hotels don't give you a special mirror for this task. You have to lean over the sink in insufficient lighting and do your best. Prince not only has a wall-mounted makeup/shaving mirror, it has a light. Not only does it have a light, it's motion sensitive, so it turns on when the sensor registers that you've leaned into the mirror.    Here's another: Prince smells good. The entire hotel is subtly fragrant in a way that surrounds you with and immerses you in the Hawaiian experience.    One more: one entire wall of my room was windows overlooking the marina. Rather than pull-down shades, my capacious room had a mechanized, opaque linen-like shade that lowered and raised at the touch of a button.    The breakfast buffet was ridiculously good. The coffee cup was never empty. In fact, the server appeared every time I took two swallows, to warm it up. I loaded my plate with fresh fruit and a made-to-order omelette, and then my server appeared with a plate of three taro pancakes I had not ordered. They were a delicious bonus for every diner.    What can I say about the staff? Never have I done business with a group that was friendlier or more efficient. They went the extra mile in ways that evidenced true commitment to my having a flawless experience in their hotel and in Waikiki.

The couch in the room we stayed in (30th floor) was a really comfortable touch, and the pool area upgrades of wooden deck and infinity pool to sit in and watch the sunset was perfect. Also the improved poolside menu and extended poolside bar hours was great and utilized by us -- great pizza, fruit spears, cucumber cooler drinks. The staff every where was super pleasant; the breakfast wait staff particularly attentive and cheerful. The only disappointment was the evening small bite menu (and same goes for the in-room menu) that there were no fruit / cheese plate choices -- would have been so good with a glass of wine later at night!. The only veggie like healthy small bite menu item was a brie item which was delicious but more like a pastry than a cheese dish. We will continue to make the Prince our go to get away place -- the view, the accessibility to Ala Moana beach park, the freedom from the craziness of congested mid-Waikiki, and of course the staff, all make it wonderful.",Oct 2017,October 2017,Traveled as a couple,I don't know if all the rooms have couches but it is really nice to have one.,"Kaneohe, Hawaii"
532279647,50,Happy in Hawaii,"The Prince Waikiki was a lovely hotel and definitely one I would return to.  Initially I had made up my mind that I wanted a hotel with an infinity pool and was torn between the Sheraton and Prince Waikiki, I went with the latter and ended up so happy with my choice. On taking a walk down to the Sheraton I saw that their pool (although beautiful) was flooded with so many people, whereas at Prince Waikiki there were times that I even managed to get the pool all to myself.  The hotel is situated in a great location as it is walking distance from Ala Mona mall and Waikiki beach but yet is still away from all the noise, hustle and bustle.  This hotel is perfect for those wanting to chill out and relax however for those with young children who want to be entertained and surrounded by loads of other children it may not be best suited to you. Staff were always very friendly, welcoming and helpful at the hotel and coming from London it was fantastic to get 1hrs worth of free international calls a day, to be able to call home when needed.

The room and bathroom were sparkling clean and both were quite large. Shower pressure was excellent. Bed and pillows were very comfy.  We thought the hotel location was a good choice for us. It is located at the west end of Wakikii away from from the major crowds and noise yet close enough to be lively. We could walk to several restaurants and a ABC store and McDonalds were a quick walk across the street for late night snacks. We used the hotels free shuttle bus to take us to the mall(actually close enough to walk) and also to downtown Wakikii to drop us at the Dukes statue to shop and eat at Dukes restaurant which is a must(reservations recommended), about a five minute walk from the shuttle drop off point.  Restaurants at the Prince hotel cater to the Asian clientele so we ate elsewhere.  Fireworks every Friday night set off by the Hilton Hawaiian village hotel can be easily seen from the harbor dock. We were told you can also see them from the hotels pool deck but we opted to walk out to the harbor and had a great viewing spot.  Be aware that the Prince has no beach and the pool is located on the fifth floor. The infinity pool and pool area is very nice with a pool bar located nearby.  We would definitely stay again.

531197918,50,Understated Elegance on Waikiki,"We were living in a house on Anini Beach (Kauai) like locals for weeks when we decided to visit friends on Oahu for a special one night visit. The Prince Waikiki is a great find among tourist-filled Waikiki Beach in Honolulu. We found a special rate that made this double room a relative bargain at just over 300. From the moment we entered the hotel we ran right into the Aloha Spirit. We were greeted by a welcoming ""Uncle"" who guided us to the check-in desk. The lobby (which I'm usually disinterested in) is gorgeous. Open, airy, with art that makes you smile and want to sit down just to look. Like our room on the 29th floor it is a statement in understated elegance. We'd considered a room on the 5th floor to be next to the ""rooftop"" infinity pool and spa tub. That would have been a poor decision. The best way to go is as high as possible. The views are truly breathtaking and we weren't even facing Diamond Head. Our room was simply beautiful; understated; with every convenience one might wish for. Beds superbly comfortable. Shower perfect for my 5' tall wife and my 6'2"" frame. We had a view of the marina off to the west with the mountains in the distance offered a breathtaking spectacle. Our two large windows open (yes, actually open easily) to the Honolulu air making it feel like we had a window to the gods (which we did). Electric black out drop curtain left us with an opaque view that was really nice. Coffee maker; safe; lovely furniture; bathroom with plenty of room and a Japanese style toilet (warm water spray; heated toilet seat....don't laugh...you'll want one installed at home immediately upon your return. Japanese engineers should be complemented on their genius...one size fits all!).  Amenities of the finest quality shampoo, conditioner; and things only my wife understands. Our double room had a comfortable L-shaped couch facing the ocean windows. All very comfortable. My only negative is that the pool encounters strong winds much of the day that make it a bit uncomfortable to spend much time sitting at the pool although the pool itself was lovely. The room safe isn't the easiest to use. But the attention to detail and usability was superb. Nevertheless, the Aloha welcome attitude permeates the entire hotel and staff making it a lovely home away from home. That spirit as well as the incredibly comfortable room; away from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki; a 10 minute walk to Ala Moana Shopping Center, made it a perfect hotel for us.

Go on runs in the morning along the marina and walk to the man-made cove. Enjoy fireworks every Friday and delight in their new lobby and infinity pool. The lobby has a Honolulu Coffee Company, which is the first hotel we stayed at that served Hawai’i coffee! There are two towers and make sure you ask which tower you’re in before you pretend to know where you’re going. The elevator ride up to your room is a treat itself. Revel in views of the city. A short Uber ride to the up and coming Kaka’Ako and the second oldest Chinatown in the U.S.    Room: Newly renovated rooms are sleek coastal with incomparable views of the marina. There isn’t a balcony BUT they have two windows that open up that are more than sufficient. How much time are you spending in your room anyway?    Food/Dining: We dined at 100 Sails for Brunch. Professional service with high-quality food. Espresso drinks available. Don’t leave without trying the Taro rolls.    Tip: Don’t miss the fireworks on Friday.

They started the renovation after that trip. We just stayed there again on our last trip back to Honolulu and I give the hotel kudos for a renovation well done. They updated the rooms and the common areas -- the lobby and restaurants and pool area and did a fantastic job. We had a wonderful stay here. One reason we like it so much is that it never feels like there are a million people in the hotel. The infinity pool that was added is also a great addition to the hotel. The service is always exemplary and so friendly. After the first night the turn down service remembered that we liked to have ice and left ice for us each of the subsequent nights of our stay.

The room and view was to die for. Breathing taking waking up each morning over looking the Pacific Ocean and Marina. Meals from within were first rates and plenty of it if you wanted more. Restaurant staff very helpful, pleasant nothing was to much trouble, I find this throughout were ever i decided to eat, of which there are many choices local cuisine, to international. For those who wish to shop their the equivalent to New York's 5th Avenue on Kalakua Ave. As for excursions plan carefully there is so much to do volcano's visits, cultural, historic buildings of Honolulu, Chinatown what i will say not what you expect.

528763219,40,Almost perfect... almost,"First time staying in Oahu and picked the Prince Waikiki for my eight night stay.    This must be the best smelling hotel I ever stayed in.    The room was as pictured on the website with a view of the sea and boat moorings. No hotel beach access so you need to do a little walking to the beaches either side, which are not huge and very popular at weekends but never totally crowded.    Situated near the bus lanes which will take you to all points of interest on the island; along with shopping options.    Hotel appears geared towards the Asian market so on site dining is limited but more western options are available outside.    The room was a great size not too hot and the bathroom has a separate bath and shower and a toilet with a control panel that would not look out of place on Kirk's Captains chair.    A fridge is supplied so you can keep your essential bottles of water cooler, ice machines are located only on specific levels.    No noise from other rooms either above or at each side.    My stay was almost perfect, things can go wrong but the judgement comes when how these problems are dealt with. A few days into my stay the TV started not showing a few channels which I thought might be an atmospheric problem but then they all went blank I reported it to the front desk who said it would be fixed in a couple of hours; but it wasn't.    The hotel corridors are hot and it hits you as soon as you step out of your room.    I would still recommend staying here",Oct 2017,September 2017,Traveled solo,,"England, United Kingdom"

Our room was in Ala Moana Tower which is the West tower and had amazing views of the marina, beach, Magic Island and Ala Moana Park from the club room on the 31st floor. The room has a specious bathroom and high quality amenities. This hotel is not exactly on the beach but 2 beautiful beaches (Kahanamoku and Ala Moana Beach) are within 5-10 minutes walk from here and the hotel has free shuttle to Waikiki Beach. The pool is one of the best rooftop pools I've ever been to. Beautiful views of the marina and the ocean from the infinity pool. Note to the hotel...please consider providing pool umbrellas. It does get sunny and the pool has no shade except for cabanas which you will have to pay extra for. The service was exceptional. From the housekeeping, maintenance, the restaurants staff and the ladies at the club lounge we experienced nothing but superb customer service. I highly recommend Honolulu Coffee Shop in the lobby for fantastic coffee and the friendliest baristas ever! We loved the location of this hotel, 5-minute walk from Ala Moana Shopping Center (don't miss Japanese food court there), very close to Waikiki Beach but without the craziness of it and, proximity of highways, in case you rent a car.

527399601,50,Best Birthday Vacation,"I have been coming to the Prince for years. I stayed with my family mid-September 2017 to celebrate my brother's birthday. We stayed for a weekend and spent majority of our time at the pool deck and enjoying a variety of food and drinks from the Prince's new restaurant 100 Sails (the old Prince Court) and the Hinana Bar on the pool deck. I was so amazed at the renovations done throughout the entire hotel, especially to the pool deck. There is an infinity pool, a regular pool, and a Jacuzzi that are available for the whole family. There are also private cabanas available for purchase to have your own area for your family to sit and relax. My family and I stayed in a cabana for the entire weekend and we ordered tons of food. Everyone enjoyed all of the food, the pools, and the ambiance of the pool deck.    At the Prince's new restaurant, 100 Sails, we had delicious food and the cocktails were the best that I have had in a long time. The buffet was also really good and I ate all the sushi that I could handle. If anyone is worried about the selection at the buffet, there are selections for everyone. For example, my mom dislikes seafood, but she was happy all of their salads, vegetables, and other selections. The bartenders at 100 Sails recommended drinks for me and I enjoyed them all, especially the Sail Away. My family was excited about the desserts and we also ordered shave ice for everyone to share.    We had the same bartender and waitress at Hinana Bar during our stay and their service was always great! I cannot express how perfect my stay was and I hope that the workers at 100 Sails and Hinana Bar are praised for their excellent service.

Also, the bar has been moved to the restaurant on the 3rd floor, so finally there is a good place to have a drink and a meal.

526858735,50,Aloha. This was my first stay at this hotel.,"I was looking for a place to stay within my per diem when a friend recommended I talk to Dennis Pearson about the rate. I booked with him and continued to pelt him with questions that he answered with a smile and much patience.    The hotel faces the water and two windows open up in the room for the trade wind experience. Not directly in the middle of Waikiki and all the foot traffic, made for easy walking or taking the shuttle. The Ala Moana shopping center was an easy walk and there is a park/ water fun across the street. The walk to the beach is an easy walk along the marina, and a little closed inlet perfect for small children or just using a float to soak in the sun. I cannot remember the tower I stayed in, but it wasn't the Ala Moana one. I think I had the better view in my tower (the side where the meeting rooms are) Sorry Prince I forgot the name. That tower view had the marina and a better view of the ocean.The room was very nice, recently renovated. The safe was actually a drawer and provided ample room to secure larger items. The water pressure was excellent and lots of hot water (I bring this up because many rooms we've stayed in the water barely tricked out). If you want bath tub, make sure to request it at the time of booking, not all rooms have one. The shower is separate from the tub, and the toilet has it's own area with a door.

525199810,50,A Waikiki Secret...,"I am a champagne-tastes-on-a-beer-budget type of person (down to design, service, decor, etc) and it's hard for me to overlook details, happy to say we were impressed by our stay at the Prince Waikiki.    As residents of Oahu having stayed in many of the Waikiki hotels - we didn't feel the need to be in the center of everything and chose the Prince after hearing about its recent renovations and reputation for oceanview rooms from every room. For the nightly rates offered at the Prince, the views alone were already a value. Oceanview rooms are typically a pretty penny in Waikiki.    They live true to their promise - the views from the rooms (highlighted by floor to ceiling windows that can open) were amazing, where we watched sunsets every evening from the comfort of our rooms. The rooms themselves were decorated VERY nicely and the layout well done. The overall design touches and details of the hotel was carried through to each room — an expectation that is not always met where some hotels have impressive lobbies but disappointing room decor. Bathrooms were grand (in decor) with fancy Japanese-style toto-washlet toilets, separate showers and handwash/sink areas.    Service was luxury-level — warm and friendly; very attentive but professional, we had noted that we were celebrating a birthday and upon our arrival, were surprised with beautifully plated desserts and refreshments, and a little totebag of useful everyday items. When we had inquired about a late-checkout, we were offered one as late as 6pm for no charge!    Although the property is not beachfront, the design of the pool area makes it feel as if you are on the water. The deck design is reminiscent of being on a boat deck especially since it is situated overlooking the Ala Wai boat harbor. The layout is expansive, taking up the area between both hotel towers with plenty of lounge seating areas, a regular pool and a smaller infinity lap pool.    When we were there, the hotel seemed calm and peaceful. We saw families, couples and some business travelers in the public areas. The public areas had plentiful seating that allowed for relaxing, reading and working so we saw several people working on their laptops.    The actual location of the hotel was, in my opinion, convenient if you wanted a little bit of everything. It is next to the Ilikai hotel, at the edge of Waikiki. It was a 10-15 min walk to Fort deRussy Beach or into Waikiki center. Parking is included in the room rate and getting in and out of the hotel was easier than if you were in the middle of Waikiki bc of traffic. They also offer a shuttle service into Waikiki, their golf course and the Ala Moana shopping center. Ala Moana shopping center, however, is only a 5-10 minute walk from the hotel so a shuttle is not necessary.    For people who do not care to be in the middle of Waikiki or to deal with the Waikiki crowds, I would recommend this hotel thoroughly. It more than makes up for its location in a variety of ways and is a tremendous value. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.",Sep 2017,September 2017,,,"Kailua, Hawaii"

523295807,50,Amazing hotel and staff,"My wife and I stayed here this past week from Mon to Saturday. It was for our honeymoon and they greeted us with a nice card and received 2 small bottles of champagne which was a nice touch.    Our room was on the 27th floor and had an ocean view. The room was very clean and spacious for a 1 bed and bathroom. My wife really liked the decor and it looked very elegant. The bathroom was also very spacious with a tub and separate shower and the toilet was sectioned off with its own door.    The staff is very friendly. Multiple times as a bell boy would come out of the elevator and even though we were still far away from the elevator, they would hold it for us. The staff was very accommodating. We had a late flight out of Honolulu at 10pm and was given a late check out of 6pm. That was really nice of them, as normal check out times i believe is 12pm.    The pool area is amazing. There is an infinity pool, separate pool for people who actually want to swim laps and a hot tub. My only wish is that the hot tub was larger. If there are more than 4 people in the hot tub it can seem a bit crammed. The view from the pool area are spectacular.    The hotel has a daily resort fee of $30 which includes 2 bottles of water daily, coffee and tea in your room and if you are renting a car, there are lots of parking spots in their lot.    We only have a few minor critiques with our stay which include soft pillows and the smell in the hotel lobby area is an acquired scent. Honestly it smelled like a mix of flowers and poop to put it mildly.    The location was great. We were far away from the madness of Waikiki beach with all the hordes of tourist but close enough if you wanted to walk. The hotel provides free shuttle service to different spots close by. You are also a 5-10 min walk to Ala Moana Centre and 10 min walk to Magic Island beach.    We didn't eat at the hotel, so I can't comment on the food. I will say that Charts down the street was not very good and would recommend going.    Overall we absolutely loved our stay here and will definitely be coming back. Thank you Prince Waikiki for an amazing stay. I highly recommend staying at this hotel if you want to stay at a nice hotel with great service and amazing views.",Sep 2017,September 2017,Traveled as a couple,,"Vancouver, Canada"
523286911,50,Rooms are beautiful,"We stayed at the Prince Waikiki for 5 nights. The rooms and bathroom are beautiful. So clean and bright with the massive windows to see the views of the boat Harbour. You can see surfing for the room. The lobby area is lovely and staff are helpful and courteous. The pool is beautiful BUT the ambiance is not so good. I felt the pool area had no character. No trees or plants and absolutely no shade around the whatsoever. No umbrellas around to sit under so you are completely exposed to the harsh sun and the sun is very harsh over there. We went to get a cocktail at the pool on our first night of arrival and the man behind the bar was very rude and pushy. He was arrogant and not very courteous at all. After having that experience with this man I didn't like going to the pool cause he was there every day. We all tipped him lots but one afternoon I decided I didn't want to  Tip him, so the next time we went there he ignored us. He didn't make us feel welcome at all. This kinda spoiled the pool time for us ladies. The restaurant 100 sails was very expensive, the all you can eat cost $58 plus tax plus tips. I ordered the chicken which was $22 US and it was awful. So a bit disappointed there. The coffee shop in lobby was nice with nice staff. The location of the Prince is ok but if I ever go back to Hawaii (I won't) I will stay somewhere else.",Sep 2017,September 2017,Traveled with friends,,"Bourke, Australia"
523082931,40,Oahu Aug-Sept 17,"We chose this hotel due to the great reviews. I also liked that it was not right in the hustle and bustle of Waikiki Beach but still within walking distance. Easy to find and lovely greeting at the drive when handing our car over for valet parking. Check in was friendly smooth and fast and luggage came up with us. We were located on the 5th floor in room 513 which is on the same level as the gym and the pool area. Our room had a balcony that overlooked the pool deck and infinity pool area but with the double glazing there was very little noise heard. My initial thoughts was it was very closed in and small, the low ceilings made it feel boxy and I was surprised the rooms were smaller than they appear on the website. However we had just come from a very big Resort Suite in Maui so I figured this was why this felt small. The room was clean and comfortable. I found it difficult to sleep the first night as you can hear the lifts in the foyer and because of our room location there was slamming of the doors from the passage to the pool area where people were still coming and going after the area was closed. I found it a noisy room for our entire stay but as we were out all day every day and often not returning until 10pm each night, I did not ask to be moved. The staff both at reception, Honolulu Coffee Cafe located in the foyer (Fabulous coffee and snacks), and the valet staff were exceptional and so very helpful and caring. I could not fault their customer service and friendly conversation. I loved that it was a short walk to Ala Moana shopping centre and that it overlooked the Marina and was quieter in its location. I would recommend this if you don't want to be in the thick of it on Waikiki Beach. We would stay again and I would recommend but not be situated so close to the swimming pool area. My only complaint was on our last night we were woken at 1 to a loud industrial sound, and after a half an hour of this I got up and went to pool area and the night staff were cleaning the cement area with a large industrial cleaner. I informed that this was very disruptive to sleeping. I spoke to reception and they had the cleaning stopped immediately with apology.

522995788,40,"Lovely hotel, skip the club lounge","Hotel is lovely! Although there is very little closet space, the room is otherwise quite comfortable (bed, bathroom, lighting, air conditioning, ect.. all very nice). Service is great. The pool is very nice! Sushi restaurant in the hotel is reasonably priced. 100 Sails restaurant has a very good crab legs buffet dinner, which you will need reservations for. I would not recommend paying anything extra to use the club lounge. We paid $100/night to use it, and didn't think it was worth that at all. We had imagined it being a larger space, where our child could play a bit, and where we could get nice food & drinks. Well although the staff in there are absolutely charming, the food in there no bueno. In typical Japanese fashion, the staff spent a great deal of time arranging the foods to present them nicely, but that doesn't change the quality of the food itself. You'll find better food in an airport lounge. There were a couple of beers on tap. and a small refrigerator with a few beverages. Small seating areas indoors and outdoors.

The staff was very friendly, and we enjoyed the special treats like the slices of banana bread left by housekeeping on our first night and chocolates on the last. The bathroom was spa-like, with a very fancy toilet and overall the room felt brand new and was decorated in great taste.

Lots of positives, including a friendly and accommodating staff, a very convenient location, and a renovation that definitely updates the look and feel of the rooms and the overall hotel (example: iPad tablet stations in the lobby). A few relatively minor things were detractors. Air conditioning was off during the entire three days in the interior hallways, making it hot and stuffy. The parking garage was downright stinky, especially on certain levels. And lastly, the bathrooms in the rooms are very small, although well stocked with amenities (including a Toto toilet/bidet).

We had arrived in Waikiki and were originally booked at another hotel - after one night at the other hotel we were not happy and decided to move.    We had noticed the Prince Waikiki (almost next door to the other hotel) and walked over to see if the Prince had any vacancies. There is a large and airy lobby area with pleasant places to sit and access from both the marina side and the street side. I explained our problem to reception/reservations staff and they were very helpful. They confirmed we could get connecting rooms for the next three nights and that one of the rooms was available immediately and we could inspect it (it was 9.30am) before deciding. We looked at the room (23rd floor) and were very happy with it. It was adjacent to the lifts but we never heard any noise at all. The rooms had been renovated recently and they were modern, clean and comfortable. The rooms were facing the ocean and we had a fantastic view. They had a very nice bathroom setup with separate toilet, shower and baths. Plenty of towels and toiletries. Generous wardrobes.    There is a Honolulu coffee shop in the lobby area which services great coffee, pastries and fast break fast items.    Located within a 5 minute walk to Ala Moana - this is an ideal hotel if you want to spend some time shopping. There is also a hotel shuttle down into central Waikiki.

The Prince(our first time) was absolutely delightful and the price so reasonable for what we received in return. Our room was on the 33rd floor with a beautiful view of the marina and ocean beyond. We signed up for the Club Room which gave us access to a variety of foods(included in the cost of the room) from 6:00 a.m. until 10:00 p.m. at night changing the variety 3 times a day. The food was varied and delicious and also they offered white and red wine.My husband commented on the peacefulness of the Club Room patio and we felt like we could stay there just for that. We had lunch twice at 100 Sails Restaurant buffet which was also outstanding with an extraordinary variety of foods for the most discerning palette. Our favorites were the Ahi Poke, tomatoes with mozzarella, handmade Sushi California roll, Clam Chowder, Shrimp and vegetable tempura, crispy garlic soy chicken, the noodle station plus so much more. The desserts we had each time we ate there(twice) was the bread pudding with vanilla sauce, the chocolate macadamia nut pie and the leche flan. KatsuMidori Sushi which is original Japanese cuisine harmonizes the flavors of Japan's four seasons with local Hawaiian ingredients to create an ultimate sushi experience. My favorite dish was Katsu Gozen which was reasonably priced at $19 plus the outstanding dessert, Anmitsu Ice Cream. A violinist played so beautifully in the lobby on our first night which added to our pleasure. All of the help in the hotel could not do enough for us and were there whenever we needed them.

Hotels in Waikiki are not cheap and we are not fans of the resort fees which seem to be charged in this type of hotel. However, the hotel is bright and has been tastefully refurbished to a high standard.  Central areas are spacious and reflect the marina theme really tastefully.  Service was outstanding from the moment we arrived, smiling and helpful staff in all areas of the hotel. We requested a late checkout, which was immediately given. As we arrived on a late flight, all restaurants etc were closed but we were directed to the nearby bar.  The room was really spacious and the beds truly comfortable. The star of the show was the huge windows, the ever changing bustling marina outside was fascinating.  Breakfast was included in our package and was of a really good standard. The serving team were delightful.  We used the pool almost daily and were pleased that there were always sun loungers available, whatever time we went. The infinity pool is a great place to cool off and has super views.  Finally, the location for us was perfect. We were concerned that we would be too far out of Waikiki but actually it was between the stunning Ala Moana beach park and Waikiki, the best of both worlds. The lagoon at the Hilton is also 2 minutes away.  Thank you Prince Waikiki for a wonderful stay.",Aug 2017,August 2017,Traveled as a couple,,"Leeds, United Kingdom"
515722674,50,Awesome!,Our weekend stay was outstanding. Amenities are terrific and staff is superb. Love the floor to ceiling ocean view from the room. Renovations to the entire hotel are beautiful. Can't wait to stay here again.,Aug 2017,August 2017,Traveled as a couple,,"Honolulu, Hawaii"
515070811,50,A weekend to remember!,"I surprised my gf and booked a staycation with the Prince Hotel Waikiki for our 6th year anniversary. We stayed at room 2803. The first thing we noticed was how spacious and clean the room was. The view looking towards the boat harbor and ocean was the best. The staff was excellent and very accommodating for our 6th year anniversary, my gf was surprised at how great the service we got. Also it was our first time swimming in an Infinity pool. I highly recommend eating at the Katsumidori restaurant or 100 sails restaurant and bar downstairs the food was perfect! Even though our stay was just for a couple days we would definitely stay here again.    To the staff of the Prince Hotel. Thank you very much.

515058638,40,Good,The hotel was very good. We loved the location away from the main drag. The service from George and Mark at the door was exceptional. The conceierge desk was very helpful.

514032891,50,Perfect location - walking distance to Waikiki but peaceful too,"We can't fault this hotel :)  We tossed up between this hotel and one in the heart of Waikiki but after visiting we are so glad we chose the Prince! Waikiki is very busy and crowded so being a 10-15 minute walk away was like a haven. There is a beautiful beach only a 5 minute walk away, but the infinity pool on level 5 is beautiful. The pool was never crowded and you could always get a deck chair even though we stayed during peak season. Cold water and towels are provided at the pool too.  It is very modern, clean and new. We had the basic room but even that was more than enough. Floor to ceiling windows, big lounge and spacious bathroom. Great magnification/light mirror in the bathroom too. Free toiletries were plentiful, and the housekeeper gave us a fabric 'Prince' bag we used at the beach. Water bottles were topped up daily too.  We arrived at 7am from the airport and even though check-in isn't until later they still accommodated us and we got a room straight away.  Queenie at the tour desk was extremely helpful in recommending sights to see, and was able to book our rental car at a much better price than we found ourselves online (almost half)!  The coffee shop in the lobby is great, especially as we are from Melbourne, they know what a flat white is!  If you are trying to justify the cost of the hotel take our word for it - worth every penny! We went on a 7 night cruise straight from our stay here and we missed our nice hotel haha",Aug 2017,August 2017,Traveled as a couple,,

511973925,50,Prince Waikiki is now my GO-TO hotel in Oahu,"Excellent, excellent service! I go to Hawaii every year since I have family here, and I usually alternate between the Hilton and the Hyatt - but now that I discovered the Prince Waikiki I'll stay at this hotel from now on. I stayed here for 7 nights earlier this month for a funeral, and I was pleasantly surprised. I booked an ""oceanfront"" room, which is on a higher floor than an ""oceanfront harbor"" room. I loved the view even though there wasn't a beach - but since my kids are grownup, being on the beach is no longer importanat. The room was clean and the cleaning ladies were very very nice. The concierge was excellent - she booked a helicopter tour for me for the same day I booked it. All the staff I encountered always greeted me with ""Good morning"" or ""Good afternoon"" and always asked if they could be of service.    The Prince had much bigger and better bathrooms than either the Hilton or the Hyatt, and my shower was separate from the toilet and tub. Since the hotel was newly-renovated everything in the room was new. There were many electrical outlets in the room - enough for 3 people - which was convenient since I had my teenage daughter and spouse with me with all their electronic gadgets.    Parking was also better and it was easier getting in and out of the parking structure. This was what surprised me the most since the hotel was right beside the very busy Ala Moana Blvd. Parking is included in the ""resort fee"" unlike other hotels where it is separate. IT WASN'T CROWDED HERE - which made for a more relaxing stay - and this was in the middle of the high season.    This hotel is an easy walk to the Ala Moana shopping center. It's also an easy walk to the Hilton shops (just go around the Hilton fence on street level - don't go up the ramp to the Ilikai) if you want to buy cookies from the Honolulu Cookie company shop or coffee from the Kona Mountain Coffee shop. This hotel is right beside the Outback and Charthouse restaurants and also close to the Red Lobster - but I didn't eat there since I wanted authentic Hawaiian food.    The gym was adequate and had new equipment. The business center had two computers and a printer - very convenient for printing vouchers or boarding passes. I didn't try the pools (one of them was under renovation) - but I never use pools that aren't mine anyway. We hosted a lunch at 100 Sails restaurant, which had a good lunch buffet, and service at the restaurant was excellent, just like everywhere else in this hotel.    I really appreciated that the hotel gave me a late check-out at no extra charge, since I had a red-eye flight back to the mainland.    I'm coming back in September for a vacation and I will definitely stay here again. I highly recommend this hotel.",Aug 2017,August 2017,Traveled with family,All rooms are ocean view but at higher floors you'll see less of the harbor,"Agoura Hills, California"

509858316,50,"Lovely hotel, lovely staff","I stayed at Prince Wakiki for a few days last week. Even though we weren't on one of the high, high, floors, the view of the marina was lovely. Amenities like beverage service and coffee maker were tucked away so there were mostly clear surfaces. The separate toilet (WC) with cleansing, shower, and bathtub were luxe touches. Controls for the toilet and the automated blinds and windows were easy enough to figure out, although a card re: the windows and blinds would have been welcome. There were ample outlets for USB and regular plugs.    Very nice robes and slippers, and the toiletries were pleasant and neutral, as opposed to the over-woodsy items some chains are using. The soaps were unusually nice, scrubby and moisturizing. Bedding was super-comfy and plenty of pillows on hand.    There is a very comprehensive shop in the lobby that has snacks, drinks, OTC medicines, gifts...One of the nicest hotel shops I've seen. No need to make a CVS run!    I wish I'd explored the coffee shop earlier...lots of great coffee offerings plus quiche, macaroons, all kinds of baked goods and healthy offerings. If I go back I'd eat a breakfast or two there.    Everyone was friendly and helpful from the front desk to housekeeping. The restaurants I tried were tasty and I did like that there were a lot of set-off ""zones"" in the public areas if you needed to wait for others.    The only quibble was the ac changing to a warmer-than-comfortable setting in the middle of the night (as so many places do). One phone call, though, got a nice oscillating fan brought to our room.    All in all, a lovely setting, keeping us and other members of our party comfortable and happy. And when I needed to call a few days later about getting a receipt (not their fault at all) they gave great customer service and I had an emailed receipt within minutes. I would stay here for vacation with no hesitation at all.",Aug 2017,July 2017,Traveled on business,,"Raleigh, North Carolina"

The dinner buffet ( with Alaskan King Crab legs and different kinds of sashimi) the breakfast buffet with made to order egg dishes was similarly delicious.

Prince Waikiki is by far the best of the best in all of the same price range. The service was excellent. The room was kept clean everyday. It is worthy to mention that the front manager Michael was always very helpful and cheerful during our stay. The restaurant staff provided outstanding service. The seafood buffet was so delicious that we went for twice in 8 days. It may be a small item to mention. There were enough power outlets (all placed logically with easy access in mind) for our laptop, cells and iPads. Unlike many other hotels, we had to find outlets under the dressers, behind the night tables, or even in the washroom. The washroom was very spacious and clean. Overall, this hotel was designed for perfection and not for minimizing cost. Most importantly, it is staffed with outstanding people.

506345143,50,Very nice hotel in very nice location,"The Prince Waikiki exceeded my expectations in almost every possible dimension. The room was spotless upon arrival. It was well-appointed with everything I needed. The staff was super helpful. Everything went smoothly.    Here are some of the highlights of my visit.    I was coming into town for a conference. I arrived late at night. There was absolutely no line when I checked in. Two minutes later, I was in my room. Other attendees reported waiting in 30-45 minute lines to get checked in. Thank goodness that was not me.    When I got to the room, I didn't see a coffee maker (actually wanted to make tea). The front desk was really helpful and agreed to send someone up right away. A couple minutes later, I found the tea-making device in a cabinet I had not checked. But they brought me a cup and some tea bags anyway, which was helpful.    The room layout was pretty standard. Probably the best thing is the curtains, which are automated. There are two levels of darkness, so you can have some privacy or achieve complete blackout.    The view from my room was fantastic. It looks out onto the harbor with lots of fancy boats, and a beautiful park, which I think is called Magic Island. It is definitely worth it to get the ocean view. If you wake up early (e.g., due to jet lag), you can see a beautiful sunrise over the boats, and at night, you can see the sunset over the park.    The location was very convenient. It is about 10 minutes on foot to the convention center. It is about 10 minutes the other direction to the main restaurant area and downtown shopping.    If you are thinking about a beach vacation, however, this might not be the best place for you, since you will need to walk down a ways to the beach by the Hilton (or possibly the other direction, though I did not go that way on the shore).    Aside from the lack of beach, the only downside I noticed is a lack of storage space in the room. Although there is a big bureau in the room, all but one drawer is used by (fridge, safe, water glasses, coffee pot). If anyone from the hotel is reading this, I suggest consolidating the water and coffee into a single cabinet to give more space for clothes. Since I was alone, it was not a big deal, but a family of four would have a tough time finding a place for all their stuff.",Jul 2017,July 2017,Traveled on business,,"San Francisco, California"
506278784,50,Beautifully done renovations to my favorite hotel on O`ahu,"This is a followup to a previous review that I did earlier in the year. I believe all the hotel renovations are done and it looks great. More casual, open lobby; really different from any other hotel that I've stayed. I commented on the rooms earlier but to reiterate, well done but still a bit lacking in dresser space if you travel with lots of luggage/clothes that do not need to be in a closet - I travel light so what they have available is more than adequate. Have gotten use to the single cup coffee maker which is simple to use. Bottle water in the fridge is a plus as I use their new exercise room and always take one with me. 100 Sails Restaurant and Bar is a great place to spend the evening (I've only stayed in the bar area) and chat with their friendly staff although my last two visits, I only went to the Hinana Bar next to the exercise room for an early dinner and a couple of drinks. Know Tammy well since her Reef Lounge days and she's always great to chat with. Now I know that Howard is very knowledgeable about college football so I look forward to more conversations with him as the UH football season approaches. As a frequent visitor, being greeted by the staff on check-in and check-out makes you feel special, thanks Melodie and Pamie! Getting a welcome back card from the hotel manager is a nice touch as well as a complimentary banana bread that I received in my room. One of the main reasons I stay at the Prince Waikiki is for the self parking - only once in 12 years have I not found parking. But the main reason I stay at the Prince is the staff; they've have got to be amongst the best in the State of Hawai`i.

505816674,50,Club Room is worth the extra money!,"My fiance was here for a work conference and we stayed almost a week. We had a club room on the 32nd floor, which was a little noisy at first since the Chapel was right above us. We considered moving (which they were happy to accommodate), but decided to stay for the superior view and barely heard noise after that.    Loved the bidet toilet seat - my fiance had a chance to finally try one and now he is sold on adding one in our home. The bathroom is nice, with short but deep soaker tub. The bed was comfy, and it was a nice change to have operable windows in a high-rise hotel! The service at this hotel is impeccable. The housekeepers are like ninjas! Seriously, we left the room once and came right back since we forgot an item, and they had already serviced out room, complete with chocolates next to the bed. Every toiletry was replaced religiously.    The Club Room next to the pool is a great added value. Free snacks all day, hot breakfast and dinner, and free sodas, wine and beer all day. It feels like a private oasis, and the ladies that work there always remembered us and were so friendly. The infinity pool is really nice with a view of the harbor and ocean, while the main pool is lovely as well. We even opted to rent a cabana for a half day and worked from the cabana with the included 2 drinks and food credit. It was kinda pricey, but a nice treat.    Close to the best hotel we've stayed at for quality, service and price, despite being in the busy Ala Moana area.

All staff, from the bellmen to the restaurant servers have bent over backwards to be of assistance. I had my wifi down for a couple of hours and they sent people immediately to fix it. It turned out that the issue needed the expert IT person, who did not arrive until 8 am, but they worked out a temporary fix through the tv until then.

Someone opened my car door (sometimes at valet service they wait until the driver opens their door - at least in my experience), there was another person that greeted us again and opened the door to the hotel, and once in there as we headed towards the front desk we were greeted by the GM, Randi Fernandez and a staff of her managers. I haven't had that type of welcome at any hotel. This was the weekend of Hokule'a Homecoming, June 2017 so we were expecting a very busy and lengthy check-in, but it took less than 5 minutes. Pammy at the front desk provided excellent customer service and we were in our room in no time.    Our room was amazing and perfect for viewing Hokule'a and the other wa'a that accompanied her during the homecoming. The room was very spacious and comfortable as were those soft beds. I really like how there was a separate shower and tub, works perfect for families that need to get ready at the same time! I also liked the automatic blinds - two different ones - but I especially liked the black out one when I needed to sleep in one morning!    The infinity pool was fantastic with ample pool seating and available cabanas if you wanted to rent one for 1/2 day or a full day. The pool staff was very nice and had a great way of making sure all of the children were safe while still having lots of fun! You are in Waikiki but we didn't really feel like it, which was perfect.

496076863,50,Brand New Hotel!,"We stayed at the brand new Prince Waikiki for a long weekend and were amazed at the transformation the property has recently gone through! From the moment we walked in and were greeted by their warm staff we knew we had made the right decision when choosing a hotel to stay at in Waikiki.    ROOMS  Beautifully appointed, we have seen some nice renovations in our travels but these rooms are so spacious and comfortable. We had more than enough space for our family of four. The bathrooms are large with separate soaking tub and shower which was great when we had to get our little family moving! Rooms included robes and slippers which were a nice touch. The mini fridge was perfect to keep our kids water and milk cold and snacks to keep them happy throughout our stay. The coffee set up was a special treat, definitely an upgraded presentation than your normal in room coffee amenity. The view from our room was spectacular but when we needed to get some rest, the automatic blinds, both a semi and full black out options were great.    RESTAURANTS  We had the dinner buffet at 100 Sails the first night and couldn't have been more pleased. The selection was outstanding, you can tell the buffet lines had been recently redone and provided a great way to showcase all of the delectable offerings. In fact the entire restaurant looked brand new, with an upscale nautical theme to match the unbelievable views of the boat harbor and Pacific Ocean below. Our favorites were the sushi chef hand rolling sushi, fresh island fish and the prime rib and crab. There were also some very nice vegetarian options and beautiful fresh fruit and local salads.    Breakfast was at the Honolulu Coffee Company in the lobby where they made our children hot cocoa (even though it wasn't on the menu) and lovely pineapple scones and yogurt parfait, a great way to start the morning. Not to mention, probably the best cup of coffee I have had in a while.    We had lunch one day at the new sushi restaurant on property, Katsu Midori, which we heard was the hottest new Japanese restaurant on the island. For lunch, they had a very reasonable lunch special ($18.50) and a kids menu that made our kids want to come back the next day. We were staying in the tower where this restaurant was, and could tell it was extremely popular, there were lines of people waiting to get in, make a reservation before you get there to make sure you can get in!    POOL  Their brand new pool area was relaxing and has to have some of the best views! There are more enough chairs for everyone, as well as these great cabanas you can rent and enjoy your day poolside. The staff from the bar are constantly checking on you, even tried some fun cocktails from their recommendations. There is an infinity pool that runs along the edge of the building that is the perfect depth (about 3 feet) to enjoy a soak and watch the sunset (and fireworks on a Friday night).    LOCATION  Couldn't ask for a better location! We were within walking distance to Ala Moana Shopping Center (largest mall) and the Hawaii Convention Center but also so convenient to all of the dining options in Waikiki.    STAFF  The staff could not do enough for you. There was always a friendly face saying ""Aloha"" and asking if we needed anything. I always judge a hotel staff on how friendly the valets and room attendants are and everyone from the minute you walk in the property to each staff member you see walking around has a friendly demeanor.    In all, it was great stay, we can't wait to come back and visit the Prince Waikiki!",Jun 2017,June 2017,Traveled with family,,"Pearl City, Hawaii"

We ate at 100 Sails restaurant, had drinks at the MUCH improved pool area and enjoyed room service. All of the food and drinks were outstanding.

The bathrooms are spacious and gorgeous with each room having a separate soaking tub and stand up shower. Your view of the ocean is just breathtaking with ceiling to floor full glass windows. The pool deck is updated with a beautiful modern vibe with a hot tub, swimming pool, and a spacious wading infinity pool. The bar servers are excellent and are right there ready to fulfill your orders. They are very friendly and attentive to your every need. Pool towels are provided along with unlimited refreshing ice water. The Prince Waikiki is a must stay if you're looking for a vacation either if you golf and site see all day and return to enjoy the pool deck to wind down, or even just using the pool deck all day and enjoying a few cocktails.

494658457,50,Formerly the Hawaii Prince Hotel,"It's been a couple of years since my wife and I have stayed here. It is now called the Prince Waikiki. Formerly it was called the Hawaii Prince Hotel. We've stayed here on several occasions over the past several years and it has gone through a few 'renovations'. Our anniversary is in early June which is when we usually book it.    It is at the beginning / edge of Waikiki, within a five minute walk to Ala Moana Shopping Center, the world's largest open air shopping center. The hotel is virtually adjacent to Ala Moana Beach Park, a nice park with a great beach and lagoon.    The hotel also has a FREE shuttle that will drop you at Ala Moana Center and then makes two more stops in Waikiki. It used run till 10:30 pm. but now it runs from noon till around 7:30 pm. If you like walking it is a nice walk to the heart of Waikiki with many things to see and many photo ops.    The hotel has again been recently renovated and this time, for the best. We've stayed after the previous renovation but it didn't look like much of a renovation ~ new carpet and flat screen tv. This renovation is a lot better.    • Automatic, floor to ceiling block out and filtered blinds  • HUGE flat screen tv with DVD, smart phone to tv capability  • FREE wi-fi that actually works and is fast  • New modern furniture  • Two free bottles of water daily  • In room Coffee and tea  • A decent FREE amenity bag with shaving kit, toothbrush/toothpaste, etc.  • Upgraded bath supplies  • Nightly turndown service with a momento  As well the standard in-room safe, house slippers, bath robes, etc.    The reception staff is great, too. Laura helped us check in and explained the new changes from the employee created artwork in the lobby to the new room packet. Being the 'first-face' of the hotel, Laura and Natsuki created a relaxed atmosphere form the get go.    Being that is was out anniversary, after being out all day, it was a pleasant surprise to find Tuxedo Strawberries, bottles of wine and a bottle of champagne, upon our return to our air conditioned room. BTW, each room overlooks the ocean and the yacht harbor where the opening scene of Gilligan's Island was shot.    The hotel has a coffee shop in the lobby, a bar, a poolside snackbar but only two restaurants. We had dinner at the Japanese restaurant, Katsumidori. I am an experienced Japanese foodie and this restaurant has excellent Japanese food. I highly recommend it.    Although there are families that stay, the hotel doesn't really have any family activities with the exception of the pool/infinity pool.    Lastly, the fitness center has been upgraded with great equipment, has been expanded in square footage but still a little cramped.    Looking forward to our next stay ~ which will be sooner than next June. :-)",Jun 2017,June 2017,Traveled as a couple,"Every room has floor to ceiling windows a good view of the ocean, the yacht harbor, the surfers...","Honolulu, Hawaii"

492620253,40,very nice stay,"I recently stayed here for a conference, and was very pleased with the organizer's decision (it was elsewhere in Honolulu previously, this was a great upgrade). All of the staff were helpful and polite. On a few occasions the front desk staff were unable to answer simple questions (for example the timing of the parade that would close Holomoana St that same day), but this seemed due to the individual's inexperience. These moments were not too inconvenient, and everyone has to learn. The rooms were very comfortable- we slept great, the couch in our room was great for catching our breath. Housekeeping was excellent, and the view (and remote controlled blinds) were very nice. There are pools on the 5th floor with bar & snack service. Pools are lovely with a view of the marina and Ala Moana Beach park, the wait service was a little to very slow, so be warned. It is an easy walk to Ala Moana, the Army museum, Waikiki (a comfortable 30 min or so to get to the heart of the action)- all in all a great location. I liked the easy access with a quieter location. Self parking was a breeze, and the coffee shop opens at 5:30 AM- perfect for an early trip to the airport or jet-lagged mainlanders. I would absolutely consider staying here again.",Jun 2017,June 2017,Traveled on business,,New York

The marina is right in front, then open oceans, also near calm beaches (a shuttle can take you to the beach). Not really beachfront, but very close.

492563239,50,A top notch hotel,"I can't say enough good things about this hotel. The staff was lovely, the views magnificent, the room was comfortable and quiet, the concierge helpful and the free shuttle very useful. We had the dinner buffet at the 100 Sails restaurant one evening and the food was great. They changed the happy hour by offering half price on selective small plate items instead of free bites with your wine or beer but still a good value. The bartenders, especially Chad, felt like we've known them forever. One very simple thing stood out for me. After going to a Luau one night, my husband and I placed our kukui nut leis on an end table. When we returned to our room the next day, housekeeping placed them into two hearts and layed them on the dresser. Who does that? A small but great touch. I also appreciated the ice cold towels you can get at the reception desk after wandering on a humid day.

Wonderful hotel with a good pool & an infinity pool, you can look out of over the bay & out to sea. Cabanas are expensive when you can have a sun bed for nothing. Good facilities & very helpful, knowledgeable staff who will give you lots of local tips & advice on where to go, what to do, where to eat & the best way to get there. If you're there on a weekend go to the flea market at the Aloha stadium. Go by bus for a hassle free local adventure. Good range of things to buy & you can haggle but there is some rubbish for sale.

It was just newly renovated and let me tell you, it is a sight to see.    First off, the location of this hotel was spectacular. I had a beautiful view of the Ala Wai Harbor and woke up to the view everyday. I was even able to open the windows and breathe the fresh air. Although it is not located at downtown Waikiki, this location was much better because it was so peaceful I was able to enjoy the vacation like I wanted to and relax. To add, the hotel is walking distance to Ala Moana Shopping Center and many amazing restaurants. If you did want to go to downtown Waikiki, it is less than a 10 min. drive.    Second, the hotel staff were so friendly and nice, it made my experience a million times better. Everyone had a smile on the face and never said no when I needed assistance.    Third, the newly renovated hotel rooms and pool area really made this hotel a jewel. The cabanas were luxurious and there was even an Infiniti pool! The bedrooms had class and style and I woke up feeling amazing everyday!    Lastly, I went to the restaurant at the hotel 100 Sails for brunch and the food was spectacular! I tried a taro bun wagyu burger which completely blew my mind! It was so good! Also, I tried the Korean style cauliflower (KFC) which I couldn't believe it was cauliflower because the flavors exploded in my mouth. I ate four of them! I would definitely recommend eating at 100 Sails restaurant during your stay. Brunch also included a full buffet, which offered a wide variety of foods and each dish was flavorful and made to its full potential!

I am a photographer, so I thoroughly enjoyed how modern and clean the design of the hotel is with much of the culture still shown throughout the hotel.

I love how I could also walk to Ala Moana Shopping Center, an ABC Superette, my favorite musubi place (Cafe Musubi Iyasume), and several restaurants / dessert places just a few blocks away!    I also love the pool and cabana areas! I heard the hotel just went through new renovations, I could totally see why everything is so fresh and modern.

In Honolulu, we stayed at the Prince Waikiki, which ended our trip on a five star note.    THE ROOM  The Prince only has south-facing rooms with floor to ceiling windows to ensure that each room has a fantastic ocean and harbour view.    The room is clean, tasteful, and has many neat gadgets including automatic blackout rollershades and a TOTO bidet. We stayed in a standard room with two queen-sized beds covered by silky bamboo sheets. The wallpaper has a romantic Japanese-style texture and print. There is a large flat screen TV, AC, and modern safe.    We particularly loved the renovated marble and tiled bathrooms. The shower and the toilet are enclosed behind two separate frosted glass doors. My wife was fond of the SimpleHuman makeup mirror.    THE STAFF  What makes the Prince stand out the most is their professional, friendly staff. They were always available to provide first class service. They can be reached through phone, internet, or in person and are always quick to respond. We received a personalized anniversary note and gift from the Prince management and the maid always leaves Hawaii themed chocolates after the turndown service.    The management at the Prince is professional and accommodating. We had a late night flight on our last day and they were able to accommodate extended hours for us in the room.    THE CLUB  We opted to have access to the more exclusive poolside club lounge. The club is a quiet hidden gem where you can have beer on tap and watch the sunset. There, you can also find a hot breakfast, appetizers, and hot entree for dinner.    THE LOCATION  The Prince is located on the West side of Waikiki, in the coveted beachfront neighborhood of Honolulu close to the beach and the shopping district.    THE AMENITIES  Two pools are on the 5th floor: a large swimming pool and an infinity pool. There is also a hot tub.    A 24-hour gym is available on the 5th floor.

I would recommend this hotel to anyone who would like a calm and inviting environment on Waikiki. The one thing I would advise is that the hotel is located at the very beginning of Waikiki, so it is about a .8 mile walk to the heart of Waikiki.

Caters a lot to Japanese tourism and the decor is warm with lots of wood, interesting features and a fab pool and bar. Airline crews also stay here. Restaurant is good but pricey. Lots of great restaurants in Waikiki to explore first. Work out area a great for a resort hotel. The views from the rooms are great ocean side and those overlook a marina allow beautiful sunsets but hopefully you'll enjoy the sunset from the beach. Bed is really comfy, plus robes, slippers, coffee maker, fridge, 2 bottles water daily, premium shampoo and soaps. Coffee shop in lobby. Quick mart across the street. I stay here every trip as it so nice and new and on the quieter side. If you want urban hustle stay further down the beach. The rooms are exactly what you see in the web site.

They have renovated the place and it is great!  finally, there are plenty of outdoor spaces to sit and relax either by the lobby, or on the new pool deck. The pool deck was a drab concrete space - now plenty of lounges, daybeds and updated bar and food service. Beautiful infinity pool overlooking the marina.  The buffet restaurant is also remodeled and the food is so much better - my mom couldn't stop eating the sashimi, crab legs and nigiri!  I usually stay at the Modern but decided to give the Prince a try after giving up on it years ago. I'm glad I did. The best part is the valet guys - so friendly and filled with the aloha spirit (especially compared to the snots that work at the Modern).

Loved the room, the bed was so comfy, we pulled the covers off the pillows to find out the brand so we can buy them for our house. The tv cable works!! And it had our favorite channel when we visit Hawaii - NHK.    Easy walk to the beach, or take a complimentary shuttle. Service is impeccable, from the moment you walk in, to the moment you leave. Everyone greets you with a smile, you really feel the ""aloha spirit"" from the staff. I got and gave a few hugs.    Infinity pool is gorgeous. The club room is fantastic, lovely and delicious treats and refreshments throughout the day.    Honestly, this hotel is a gem amongst all the hotels in Honolulu.

The view from the room is awesome, overlooking to marina with a sunset view and the shades are great, having both a lite and black-out shade is great, allowed us to cut the afternoon sun but still have light, yet sleep in with complete dark.  Wifi in the room was fine, not speed or connection issues.  Bottom line, you get what you pay for.

The sprawling lobby is modern and inviting and there is a Honolulu Coffee Company!!! They have the best coffee on the island, possibly the state. What a treat! The room was gorgeous, but tasteful, and since this is an older property, they are larger than some of the newer hotels. Best surprise: Malie brand toiletries! Divine! Worst surprise: Brunch buffet is $60 per person! We were hungover and hungry and stumbled downstairs for sustenance and in our stupor, didn't check on the price.

This is just one of the things that makes this hotel great, though. The strip of hotels in nearby Waikiki is busy - this is a quieter gem. The rooms have understated modern decor, and windows open if you like fresh air. There is no immediate beach access for this hotel, but it has a beautiful curved infinity pool on the 5th floor.

481031186,50,"Beautiful remodel, spectacular views, outstanding service!","Spent 2 nights recently with my wife and 7-year old daughter and had a lovely ""staycation"" (my daughter is *still* talking about this, 2 weeks later). My wife and I had stayed here over 15 years ago when it was the Hawaii Prince Hotel Waikiki. What an amazing transformation.    Arriving on Friday night after work, parking was easy and we were treated to an unexpected welcome surprise of the front row fireworks display right above the harbor (Hilton Lagoon on Fridays). When we checked in, the staff told us about the cool new sculpture installation overhead. Our beautifully designed suite on the 30th floor was very tastefully furnished with a living room area, dining area and humungous bathroom. The room was prepared with a few amenities which we had requested when we made reservations. And because it was dark when we arrived, we didn't fully appreciate the floor-to-ceiling ocean view until we woke the next morning. My stunned daughter simply said ""whoa."" (Bonus points for the motorized window shades in every room, her favorite feature.)    We met friends for dinner at the newly renovated 100 Sails Restaurant (formerly the Prince Court) and we chose the buffet: light years ahead of what I remember from the previous restaurant's offering. Prime rib station, sushi station, plenty of fresh seafood and excellent desserts. Go for it.    We also had the upgraded Club Lounge access during our stay - most definitely worth it, especially traveling with family. Key card access to a private indoor/outdoor area overlooking the pool / harbor gives you unlimited access to hot and cold food items during breakfast hours, and additional food and snack offerings after 4pm. All this with coffee/tea, bottled cold beverages plus beer + wine on tap at all times? I'm positive I spent more waking hours at the lounge than I did in our room.    The newly renovated pool and jacuzzi area were great but my daughter could not get enough of the new infinity pool. While it's not huge, it's pretty dramatic, curving and overlooking the harbor and ocean view.    We were also there for an event in Waikiki and this location proved to be ideal - close to everything but quiet and ultra convenient to the shops at Ala Moana and Ward.    On our last day while hanging out at the Club Lounge, a staff member overheard us talking about a late check out, and he offered to make it happen. He was able to take our room cards and re-key them right there in the lounge, and gave us WAY more time than we had asked for. No need to rush back to the room early to shower and change, we got to relax and extend our staycation a little longer.    Highly recommend this place, and especially the Club Lounge access!",May 2017,April 2017,Traveled with family,"All rooms have an ocean view, so ask for the highest floor you can get!","Kailua, Hawaii"

A nice addition to the lobby is Honolulu Coffee Company, which provides delicious baked treats, smoothies and of course, Hawaii-grown coffee. We loved all of the little touches such as the Malie toiletries and super comfy beds. The pool deck renovation is fantastic... the infinity pool overlooking the harbor can't be beat. 100 Sails offers an amazing buffet for seafood lovers. I've never been to a buffet with such high quality sushi and sashimi... fantastic! The staff went out of their way to make our stay extra special and we greatly appreciate it.

This hotel is in a great location right on the Honolulu marina and within walking distance to the conference center and to Waikiki restaurants. The hotel was recently renovated. I had a room on a high floor with great ocean views. The bed was super comfortable and the room was squeaky clean. I asked for a late check-out and was offered this for free until 6 pm on the day of departure. Kudos to the hotel for this!  However, there were a few minor annoyances: 1) it is not possible to charge food and drinks from the coffee place in the lobby to the room; 2) the gym is rather small; 3) the elevators can take a long time to arrive.

479547691,50,Renovated Waikiki Gem!,"Wonderful weekend getaway with my wife and daughter at the Prince Waikiki. The Prince is perfectly located at the edge of Waikiki so it's much quieter than the hotels on Kalakaua Ave and it's super close to Ala Moana Mall.    Top notch service from the staff was appreciated. Rooms were very modern and simple, but in an elegant way. Nice finishes and tasteful details. One of my favorites was that you can fully open your windows, no screen, nothing...just fresh Hawaiian air. Hard to imagine without actually being in the room but to be 26 floors up with a stunning view through open window was phenomenal.    Having a 4-year old daughter, we spent lots of time at the pool. While the pool isn't deep (only about 4 feet max) it was more than enough to fully immerse yourself and I honestly didn't feel like I needed deeper. The infinity pool overlooking the marina is a nice touch as well. We upgraded to access the private lounge near the pool with drinks and light foods served all day long. For kids, this is perfect...easy snacks to keep them in a good mood. Totally worth the extra fee as beer and wine are on tap.    Overall, this was the first time at the Prince and I will definitely return and recommend it to visiting family.",Apr 2017,April 2017,Traveled with family,All rooms directly face the ocean so they're all good...higher in the tower give better and...,"Kailua, Hawaii"

478254137,50,Wonderful Christmas stay!,"My family and I stayed here for two weeks in December. The hotel was going through renovations and construction, but I am not going to take away any ratings due to that and related noise. The pool was closed (bummer!) BUT the beach is nearby and my son and I loved going there everyday. The front desk always had clean beach towels available, and gave my son a little beach bucket with sand toys. The gym is small but kept clean and has the basic essentials (weight bench with weights, treadmills, elliptical, leg machines). Gym bonus: two patios with sliding glass doors which made it easy for me to keep an eye on my son as he played with his gadgets, while I was working out. The shuttles to various places in Honolulu (Ala Moana center, and downtown areas) made getting around easy! Many, grateful thanks to Michi, the shuttle driver, who made our trips enjoyable. He truly is a gem and I hope the hotel management recognizes him - he went out of his way one night to make sure my son and I got on the shuttle when the Ala Moana stop had been closed off to traffic. Everyone we encountered was incredibly nice, even the construction workers. The doormen were polite and easy to talk to, the housekeepers reminded me of old friends. One problem we had was the lack of a laundry room within the hotel, so we had to make trips to the local laundromat which cut into fun time. The view from our room was beautiful with the exception of the tons of trash in the boat harbor. I hope the hotel can coordinate with the owner of this boat harbor to have it cleaned often (maybe once a week they can hire needy workers to keep this clean? Just a thought). Many thanks for the fresh coffee in the mornings, and flavored water in the afternoon. We never took advantage of the restaurant in the hotel (we looked into Christmas dinner but it was already full). Tips for those travelling with kids: Magic Lagoon is nearby, less than 10 minute walk, and has a very low key beach which made us feel very safe. There is also a running/walking path, shaded in many parts, which my son loved running on. Also, if you do plan on walking to/from the downtown area, its about half an hour with a little one in tow. We saw a magic show and by the time it was over, the hotel shuttles were done for the day, so we walked back to the hotel.

Nice that you can have multiple getting ready at once in the bathroom.    Be sure to check out the 100 Sails restaurant. We were fortunate enough to do both the dinner buffet which included multiple types of crab and the breakfast buffet which was just as bountiful. Both were on the expensive side so be forewarned.
