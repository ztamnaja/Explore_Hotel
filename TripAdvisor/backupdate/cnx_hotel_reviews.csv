We stayed at two bedroom villa with the pool as we traveled with my two teenage boys. There are two separate villas on each side of the pool. The rooms are beautiful, in historic Thai villa’s, the decor of the resort is stunning. The lunch was fantastic, the private dinner the best Thai food we had during our travels. The breakfast you have to order the day before and it was ok. This resort is in town, So you do have traffic noise at night and it’s under a flight path, so you do hear airplanes over head at night.","Date of stay: August 2022","Trip type: Traveled with family","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Originally traditional Thai style homes converted into beautiful private villas in a compound cut off from the rest of the world, we were able to completely unwind during our short but sweet stay at Mahabhirom. It’s also a great place to enjoy the art pieces on display by Chamniam Thongma, who apparently also helped design the hotel. If you find his art enjoyable, his studio is about 30 min driving north from the hotel as well, where you’ll find more of his renown pieces and can enjoy additional chill time at the riverside studio cafe.
The hotel compound is also thriving with lush vegetation, providing fresh cool air and lots of flowers to enjoy, something that was especially welcoming for us coming from Bangkok.
The staff are super attentive at the hotel, bringing us lime and ice water while we were swimming in the pool, allowing us to late checkout till 4pm as our flight was at 6:30pm, helping with bookings, etc. 
We thought perhaps the noise of jets taking off/landing at the nearby airport could be considered the only negative by some, but we got used to it quickly and the positives of the hotel outdoes this so much. It’s also conveniently located relatively closely to Wat Umong, the Baan Kang Wat area and the numerous cafes & restaurants that surround it. 
While we felt the hotel restaurant being Vietnamese was a bit curious, their breakfast was really tasty and a great alternative to the typical “breakfast buffets” you get at many hotels in SE Asia. There are only three choices of breakfast dishes but they are regional (Thai/Vietnamese) and well prepared with a side of fresh fruits. I sometimes feel that some hotel breakfast buffets (not all, some are superb btw) are a result of the chef not giving a damn about breakfast, so Mahabhirom’s breakfast, while few in options, was a much appreciated and refreshing alternative.
Its well worth the price, we certainly felt this way as by the second day, we decided to spend most of the day at or near the hotel. Cozy, secluded, comfortable and simply relaxing.
Obviously I recommend this hotel completely for anyones visit to Chiangmai and I look forward to when we come back.","Date of stay: January 2021","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

There were supposedly 12 guests staying on property - we hardly ever saw other guests. 
We are foodie people from Portland and we were blown away by the Thai cuisine we had on property. Come to breakfast hungry - the American breakfast consists of 3 courses (fruit platter, homemade yogurt/granola, bread basket (warmed croissants), and main entree of eggs, bacon/sausage and potatoes/squash. We also enjoyed the Khao Soi for breakfast - chicken braised in a warm curry sauce with homemade noodles. Everything we ate and drank here was amazing and way better than restaurants in town.

From start to finish every member of staff ensured that this was a perfect stay.  The staff are always on hand and ready to assist you, without in any way being intrusive.
Everyone is knowledgeable about the city, sites and available activities and are proactive in arranging things to make your city visits simple and enjoyable.  They have a range of companies they have information on for each activity, which gives you a nice choice.

Although the hotel is further out from the old city than most, this allows you more space than other places in beautiful grounds, with a lovely swimming pool and spa/massage services.  The rooms themselves (individual villas really) are gorgeous, with showers as well as standalone baths, air con and are all services several times each day-a lovely touch when you come back from a city trip.

The hotel offer free shuttles at any time of day to take you into the old city (airport collection and dropoff are also available for a small fee-1200 THB).  For other trips they can call you a private car.  If you want to save some money, you can take a private car out to sites like the temples and then get a public taxi for the return trip-might save you £20-£30 a day.
Taxis from the old city to the hotel cost between 150for a red car (communal taxi) or approximately 200-250THB for a private tuk tuk, neither of which are expensive.

I can't express again how incredibly friendly, competent and helpful every member of staff is, with the management team and senior figures being visible presences and incredibly helpful as well.  A really wonderful place to stay.","Date of stay: September 2019","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

My friend and I agree that Villa Mahabhirom is the best hotel we have ever visited. They treated us like royalty from the moment we arrived. Everything about the service was impeccable. Lovely that we visited during low season and got the entire hotel to ourselves for the first part of our stay. We wanted to do some activities such as visiting an elephant sanctuary, Thai cooking class, temples, and the spa. The concierge arranged everything for us, including transportation. The villas are so clean & beautifully decorated, with plenty of space. The personal touch given by each and every staff member made us feel like we were guests at a home, rather than at a large hotel. The general manager, Holman, was a friendly face every day who made sure we had everything we needed. He always made sure everything ran smoothly. His entire team of waitstaff, front desk/concierge, housekeeping, and drivers also ensured we were always taken care of.

The exterior belies the exotic and unique setting inside where the small lobby opens into the expansive pool area that is flanked by these lovely wooden villas on stilts.

They are situated in lushly landscaped property with nice modern touches and a blend of antique furniture.  The villas themselves are lovely and well appointed while still retaining the character of these ilder Thai houses.  Most importantly the staff are warm, friendly and genuine and absolutely reflective of lovely Thai hospitality.

We had a private pool and an amazing outdoor living room for lounging. The bathroom had the most amazing shampoos, body wash that if we had the room in our luggage, we would have brought some home.

Villa Mahabhirom is beautiful. Lovely Thai houses put together adorned with beautiful antiques and stylish decorations. Food is lovely and best of all is the service! All the staff are helpful and friendly. P’Or (I hope I’ve spelt her name correctly), the lovely team leader here, is very caring and she also makes fabulous suggestions of places to go. Without her, we wouldn’t have experienced the amazing lantern festival at the famous Haribhoonchai Stupa in Lumpoon.

To those who are afraid of geckos and dislike insects, we didn’t experience any while we were there! A very pleasant surprise!

True to its name, Villa Mahabhirom is a place of great enjoyment. We’ve enjoyed every minute of our stay and will certainly be back!","Date of stay: November 2018","Trip type: Traveled with friends","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Also the villa is very beautifully made with small little details which you can’t find much of in Thailand! 

But what really stood out were the staff, they helped me with bookings, and planned out my whole itinerary when I was in Chiang Mai! Making my stay easy and relaxing without me stressing out what to plan next! Also all the staff were very helpful and friendly almost like family!

The owners however have also instilled a serene almost ZEN atmosphere and at the same time give you a feeling of being at home .... (or at a friend's home).

The property painstakingly refurbished and prepared over 7 years is amazing and allows a glimpse into another century lifestyle without forgetting the modernity of the hot shower or the cable TV.....

The villas are over 100 years old teak houses which were bought in different parts of Thailand, renovated and reassembled at its current location in Chiang Mai.  The interior as well as the exterior design is very curated with art pieces from Europe and the Mekong area, creating an outdoor museum itself. It is a place of tranquillity and beauty where relaxation reaches new levels.  Below you will find our top ten highlights of the villas:

• Design: Beautiful teak houses which provide an historically authentic way of staying with modern amenities. The villas are very cosy and stylish. 
• Art: Amazing collection of art items within the old houses and in the greenery around them, the hotel is a museum itself. 
• Service: Very friendly and accommodating staff giving you the feeling of being home in Thailand. They are very attentive and charming, giving you your own space.
• Privacy: Private parts of the property with total intimacy for up to 6 people.
• Intimacy: There are only 14 villas, therefore the hotel never feels crowded. In the gardens or around the teak houses, there are many secret spots where you can find total tranquillity and peace such as the library or the tea house.
• Breakfast: Very delicious breakfast served in the beautiful bar area (try the fruit granola yoghurt bowl).
• Cocktails: Delicious, fruity and original cocktails accompanied with creative snacks.
• Cleanness: The rooms are very clean and the whole garden area is very well maintained
• Swimming pool: The pool with its black tiles allows the reflection of the buildings as well as the greenery and provides a perfectly designed relaxation area.
• Location: Convenient location nearby the airport and some shops like 7-eleven. Moreover, it is located within 5 min walking distance from Wat Umong temple.","Date of stay: August 2018","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Serene Destination. Great Staff.","This chic boutique resort has transported antique traditional Thai villas to their property, situating them in a tranquil, art and nature-filled environment.

It has clearly been a passion project of owner to create a sanctuary of first class accommodation here. I like that the hotel is locally owned but managed by a world-class team with top tier resort experience. Aor (formerly of Aman group) and her team are truly second to none. I came to know several by name even though it was just a three day, two night visit. Thank you Jay, Mameow, Biggie and all for your generous hospitality. 

The reception was wonderful. I travel the world on a folding bicycle and arrive without reservation at some of the finest hotels in the world. It is always interesting to see how a dusty traveler is greeted. Here, there was a lovely warmth; They were happy to make me feel right at home - in a beautiful, sophisticated home none-the-less. 

The two story villa was delighful. The traditional Thai structure with open ceilings revealed the underside of the scalloped pattern terra cotta tiles. The villa had a certain cozy grandeur. I was told each of the buildings were scaled to suit the size of the original owner. Mine, it was conveyed, was likely inhabited by an older smaller lady. But it suited me just fine. :)

The bathroom was excellent: A fabulous tub, generous generous shower and a Japanese automatic toilet, no less. 

I enjoyed my little balcony overlooking the saltwater pool in the main courtyard.

I spent the better part of an entire day in tranquility soaking up unobstructed sun poolside. The pool was generous enough to do some laps in so I could convince myself I wasn't completely being lazy. 

Food was great, focusing on excellent Thai cuisine. I enjoyed breakfasts, a lunch and a dinner while there. (The signature sticky fried rice was delish.)

I enjoyed a spa treatment. Beautiful environment once again in a lovely pavilion for a good Thai massage. 

The art collection sprinkled throughout the property added charm and whimsy, and the library with its collection of books and the tea room were unique spaces making the resort feel more like a private estate than a resort hotel.  

All good things must come to pass unfortunately, but my departure was also very memorable. The reception team gathered for a photo to wish me adieu as I set out by bike again for my next destination...","Date of stay: October 2017","Trip type: Traveled solo","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Am sitting by the pool with no one else in sight. Being an adults-only hotel, you can have a quiet time without having kids running around. I managed to read my book while my Husband swam yesterday afternoon. 

Staff is very attentive. The resident manager brought over some towels when she saw us settling in the deck chairs. Just had coffee and server came over to ask if we needed a top up of coffee when we were almost done with our first. The same server just got us some ice water as we sat by the pool now! 

The room (102) is spacious. Bathroom is modern. The villas are moved here from central Thailand (Ayutthaya). It's amazing how they can last for so Long. The rooms get a lot of sunlight in and I really like that. 

Ninmman area has a lot going on and worth exploring. This part is more vibrant and Creative than the old city. 

The management of the establishment took the effort to meet and greet us. A nice gesture. A pity that there are so few reviews here. Couples who want to getaway from the hustle and bustle for a few days should consider this place. 

The hotel is beautiful decorated with the many pieces of art. There are also lots of instagram-able pictures to be taken.

The property was newly opened in late 2016, but we were told that the owners had spent years building and decorating the place with many art pieces and antiques. 

It is a very tranquil place. We booked the 2 villas at the back with a shared pool. However, having seen the other villas, all are quite similar inside. The century old Thai/Lanna teakwood villas were bought by the owner and moved to this location. Each villa is split into 2 levels, upstairs is the bedroom and bathroom, and downstairs is the living room. However, the downstairs is an open area (not enclosed, no doors/windows) facing the inner courtyard so not quite enticing for us to sit and lounge there. 

The food is very good.  I particularly love the local dish (see photo), the bowl with chicken leg and crunchy noodle on top called “Khao Soi”.

The property has eclectic, some hunting lodge decor (I am not that into their fine examples of taxidermy though), generous supplies of Panpuri toiletries, the house has lights coming in from all side, surrounded by lush vegetation, trees with bright orange peacock flowers, birds chirping away by day and geckos by night.  The room also has a beautiful antique looking chandelier.   

Both the GM Manfred (ex GM 137 Pillars) and the lovely lady resident manager (Hataipatra Sriudom) introduced themselves when I first arrived.  Service was good throughout fhe stay, I liked for example how they cleaned up my room even on my departure date.   

I went to David's kitchen for dinner but stayed here for lunches as this fab place was so serene, I found it hard to peel myself away.   The peace was occasionally broken by the sound of an airplane (and by a nearby nightclub blasting away on Saturday night).  Even in the public spaces, you feel like you are home alone (in a good way).   

I have been to both 137 Pillars and the divine Dhara Dhevi before, Dhara Dhevi's stay was in their converted ""rice barn"" which was more luxurious vs here but you are out of town (both good and bad) and paying 50% more.  ( Here I enjoyed hopping over to Wat Umong at 6 ish in the morning, there is also a boxing studio next door which I intend to check out next time, I had a 2 hour deep tissue massage instead with an ex therapist from Amanpuri-- pure bliss).   

In sum, if you crave comfort, privacy & service, this is it.","Date of stay: May 2017","null","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

Am sitting by the pool with no one else in sight. Being an adults-only hotel, you can have a quiet time without having kids running around. I managed to read my book while my Husband swam yesterday afternoon. 

Staff is very attentive. The resident manager brought over some towels when she saw us settling in the deck chairs. Just had coffee and server came over to ask if we needed a top up of coffee when we were almost done with our first. The same server just got us some ice water as we sat by the pool now! 

The room (102) is spacious. Bathroom is modern. The villas are moved here from central Thailand (Ayutthaya). It's amazing how they can last for so Long. The rooms get a lot of sunlight in and I really like that. 

Ninmman area has a lot going on and worth exploring. This part is more vibrant and Creative than the old city. 

The management of the establishment took the effort to meet and greet us. A nice gesture. A pity that there are so few reviews here. Couples who want to getaway from the hustle and bustle for a few days should consider this place. 

The hotel is beautiful decorated with the many pieces of art. There are also lots of instagram-able pictures to be taken. 

As it is near the airport, the only major drawback would be the noise from the planes. 

Picture is the view I'm enjoying now.","Date of stay: September 2017","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

You can hear the wind touch the leaves and birds singing. Villas are renovated from old houses from central Thailand. I love this concept as I like historical things. In Villa Mahabhirom, I can stay in a historical building with modern touch and modern facilities. Its cool, awesome and romantic.
Staff very nice and professional! They always take care of your need. But they won't always wander around you. That give you more space and make you feel like you own the whole space. 
Design is cool and eye catching everywhere in the resort. I like the reflection of the swimming pool, the statue with lively facial expression, the vintage chandeliers in the library and rooms.

Located in Mae Tang district, Bad Boy Valley is the remarkable result of love and passion. The owners, who fell in love with the art and craftsmanship, share the very determined resolution about giving back to the society, with a plan to create a magnificent set of private art and craft pieces in order to create a superb livable museum.

A hidden gem!","Love our stay here last December! Friends joined us in Chiang Mai after staying at Aman in Phuket and didn’t like the crowd there, but absolutely love this place. 

The property was newly opened in late 2016, but we were told that the owners had spent years building and decorating the place with many art pieces and antiques. 

It is a very tranquil place. We booked the 2 villas at the back with a shared pool. However, having seen the other villas, all are quite similar inside. The century old Thai/Lanna teakwood villas were bought by the owner and moved to this location. Each villa is split into 2 levels, upstairs is the bedroom and bathroom, and downstairs is the living room. However, the downstairs is an open area (not enclosed, no doors/windows) facing the inner courtyard so not quite enticing for us to sit and lounge there. 

The food is very good.  I particularly love the local dish (see photo), the bowl with chicken leg and crunchy noodle on top called “Khao Soi”. 

The staff are all extremely friendly and helpful and gave us many insider tips on where to go in Chiang Mai (non-touristy stuff).

Definitely the place to stay for understated luxury, discreet service and privacy!","Date of stay: December 2016","Trip type: Traveled as a couple","ui_bubble_rating bubble_50"

If a hotel qualifies as boutique because it has no lift, no hot water..and we mean none, actually asked at reception and was told that no sinks have hot water...the shower did get to tepid...and no plug in sink anyway....rooms were also damp, but that may have been natural humidity. The hotel was reasonably clean but definitely showed lots of general wear. Overall we would say it was a good place for a young couple doing a backpack trip to the area, who wanted the next step up from a dorm. Guess we just have a different meaning for the word boutique.
