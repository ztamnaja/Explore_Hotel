I definitely recommend skipping the over priced hotels and staying here instead. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone coming to Waikiki.  Yes there was some small things but they are remodeling to make the hotel even better so it was understandable and in no way affected my experience.

Just as we thought the experience couldn‚Äôt be better, we were also invited to the ‚ÄúManager‚Äôs Hour‚Äù at the Monkey Pod.  Here we met we believe his name was Craig, the manager. He made us some drinks and gave us lots of recommendations. We also love his character and energy!    Couldn‚Äôt thank them enough!    As far as the vicinity itself, it exceeds our expectations.

861729366,30,Lots of little things can be improved,"Hotel itself was fine but it was the little things that made for big annoyances. The room had no side tables next to the bed on either side. Very annoying. There was only one thin blanket in the room so I had to ask for another one. Only two towels in the bathroom. They only have valet parking ($40 a day) so you have to wait for that whenever coming or going. Even if it‚Äôs just 15 minutes each time, not exactly what you want to do a few times a day. Just little things that make for big inconveniences.    There was also construction noise in the room directly next to ours with no apologies or anything from the hotel.    Wasn‚Äôt the worst experience, bed was soft, nice views from the balcony.",Sep 2022,September 2022,Traveled as a couple,,

861466387,50,The Detailed Review,"Checked into Hotel La Croix on September 15th and checked out on September 21st.  Check in was at 3pm while check out is at 11am.    Valet is priced at $41.83 a day. Unfortunately there is not self parking option. If you want to park at the hotel you MUST valet. It is what it is‚Ä¶ Room cleaning is not done daily, you must request it from the front desk 24 hour in advance.    WARNING  During my stay the hotel is completing renovations. The do tell you that there will be heavy noise between 9am - 5pm. Never stayed in the room during these times so it wasn‚Äôt a problem for me. I did stay in one day and there would be constant loud pounding sound. Just be warn if you are trying to sleep in.    THE ROOM  I reserved the Gold Ocean View Room with Queen beds. Room was nice and specious. The room had a desk, mini fridge, ironing equipment, flat screen and a safe.  The room had hardwood floors (personally not a fan, of hardwood floors in a hotel).    THE RESTROOM  Restroom had a waterfall shower head, no tub. Restroom has black granite floors. Restroom had lotion, conditioner, shampoo, body wash and two soap bars. The shower head leaked from where the head connects to the pipe, screwing it in stops the leaking. The door from the restroom to the bedroom did not want to close. Was not a problem but if you need privacy from everyone else, I would make sure it works.    THE CLOSET  The closet is kinda small, hangers felt kinda old. It did it‚Äôs job. No complaints.    THE LOUNGE  Fortunately with my reservation I was granted access to Monkeypod Lounge. The lounge is open form 7:30 am to 8:00 pm. The lounge is a cute little room that has a fridge, microwave and a touchscreen coffee machine.    From 7:30 - 11 they have mini muffins, butter cookies, bananas and apples  From 11 onward they remove everything except the bananas and apples but add chips.    The following drinks were provided Coke, Diet Coke, Water, Hawaiian Branded drinks, and apple/orange juice.    THE POOL  Pool seemed kinda small, didn‚Äôt really spend time in the pool area. There‚Äôs a bar next to the pool with a limited selection of drinks. Sauna is also next to the pool, did not end up using the sauna.    THE STAFF  The staff was amazing, I have no complaints.  The check-in employees were funny and courteous. They answered any questions I had about the hotel and about Hawaii.  The cleaning employee (Mhila) was great, during my stay I requested the room to be cleaned once (did not spend much time at the hotel). All the old towels were replaced with new towels and trash emptied. I did run into Mhila after the room cleaning and she asked if I needed anything else.  There were many valet drivers, but I interacted the most with Miles. Nice friendly guy always attentive to my needs, had good conversations with him.    RANDOM  The restroom has a window around waste high that opens into the closet. The closet then faces out to the balcony. You can see outside into he plaza from your restroom. I asked the night people at the front desk and I was told it was so you can enjoy your view while showering. I think that would be great for a bath tub, not with a standing shower. Kinda weird if you‚Äôre into that kinda thing.    ABC store is located on the grown level. Very convenient for quit bites and supplies.    CONCLUSION  I enjoyed my stay. I would stay here again.",Sep 2022,September 2022,Traveled solo,,
861394985,50,Great staff and location,"Shirin and Anna really went the extra mile to make sure that our stay was comfortable and enjoyable, The Gold corner had amazing ocean and city views and was much quieter. The lounge access was a great addition giving us a place to grab drinks and eat meals as a family outside our room. The Valet parking while pricey(all parking is expensive in waikiki anyways) was hassle free and had our car for us in 5 min or less, nice to not worry about parking on our holiday. Sauna was A+ and pool was great to cool off in. Some renovations are happening but for us it wasn't a problem.    We really liked that the hotel was close enough to walk to the restaurants and shops in waikiki but was far enough away that it was quiet and had little foot traffic. Beach park gave us easy access to the beach and kept the view to the ocean open.",Sep 2022,September 2022,,Corner and higher floor rooms are best,

I found the Hotel La Croix on Airbnb and the reviews were good so I made a booking, without receiving confirmation I went straight to the hotel and was received by a very welcoming team at reception.

The hotel is a little outdated especially in the rooms/bathrooms, but the staff here are absolutely wonderful. Manager Douglas was super accommodating when I learned my room did not have a microwave. I initially asked if my room was supposed to come with one since my reservations showed it did and I paid for it. Douglas stated it was an error on Pricelines side and that they haven't updated their inclusions/ exclusions. But after that, Douglas went above and beyond and gave us access to the VIP lounge/terrace which had a microwave and other amenities. He didn't have to do that since it was Priceline who posted an outdated picture, but he was super nice about the whole situation. So far our stay here has been comfortable and relaxing.

The elevator was interesting though! The labels and the floors didn't match. I stayed on the 6th floor but it said 8 when the doors opened. I believe the button was a different number still but they had paper attached to reassign the number. You also have to request housekeeping so my room was only cleaned once before I checked out.

855846791,50,"Amazing service, reasonably priced and central!","H√¥tel LaCroix was my choice of Hotel during my recent visits to Honolulu.    Firstly, they have an amazing texting system with the front desk, meaning you can literally ask for anything (Towels, shampoo, etc) or have your questions answered through this system. In addition, the front desk employees are the most kind hotel employees I‚Äôve ever talked to. Douglas was the one who greeted me and was kind enough to go the extra mile and ask questions about where I‚Äôm from and what I enjoyed as hobbies while checking me in. He even made suggestions of nearby restaurants and things to do.    The rooms are pretty standard. This isn‚Äôt your totally upscale resort, but if you‚Äôre looking for a decent hotel for say a family or couple, this would be a decent choice.    Another added benefit is that right across from the street is a cheaper parking alternative where you pay $24 to leave the car overnight. This is a cheaper option than Hotel LaCroix at around $40/night, but the fact that this place was suggested to me from a Hotel LaCroix employee (during my first phone call to confirm my check in) when I asked him for cheaper parking alternatives, really goes to show the type of culture this company has.    - Eldinn",Aug 2022,August 2022,Traveled as a couple,,

Vince made sure we very little reason to get out of the pool and Shiri and Zach were not only very helpful but greeted us and asked questions about where we were going or where we had been.    I was less than thrilled with management however. The hotel is undergoing renovations and work was scheduled in the rooms next to our and started two days before we were to leave. Managements solution should have been to schedule the work in areas where guests were not staying or simply not where construction would be going on. Instead they said we could move rooms.

This is a solid choice if you looking for something less expensive within walking distance of the beach and shopping in Waikiki. The only criticism I have is of the bathroom. Who designed this?

853553716,40,My experience at this hotel.,"The only reason why I am giving such a great review is because one of the employees Zachary had given excellent customer service the second time around. I had stayed here a few weeks ago for the first time and I had a horrible experience. First off check in is at 3:00PM which is okay, I called and asked for early check in and they had said that wasn‚Äôt possible for that day due to high volume so my room would be ready by 3:00 which I was okay with. I got to the hotel an hour early to kill time at the pool before check in and went down at around 3:30 to check in and they had told me my room wasn‚Äôt ready yet‚Ä¶On top of that I booked through agoda and not directly through the website so I wasn‚Äôt even able to get the kamaaina rate for parking. Parking is $40 and $25 for residents of oahu. I think it‚Äôs kind of ridiculous that just because i booked through agoda I can‚Äôt get a residency discount on parking. Late checkout also is never an option here even though I wasn‚Äôt even able to check in at the time promised. I stayed here again to give it another try last night and my experience was much better. Zachary was very kind and explained everything so well a lot of the other staff just told me ‚ÄúSorry unfortunately‚Ä¶‚Äù repetitively. He helped me check into the hotel smoothly and made sure my stay was better than my first experience.

853175748,10,Try another hotel,"Wow, where do I start?  We arrived at about midday and were told our room wasn‚Äôt ready and check in was 3pm however she would expedite the cleaning to get us in.  Great, when should we come back we asked? 3pm. üòë ok that was good expediting. This was slightly annoying since we had come off a long flight and just wanted to refresh for a little bit but were sent out into the heat to wander for 3 hours.    We returned at 3pm only to be told there was a  situation and the room we had booked was no  longer available and that we would be offered a  lower value room but a small voucher to  compensate us. We declined the voucher as we  weren't returning to Hawaii and requested our  original booked room. After what felt like an hour,  they miraculously found a room for us that we had  booked.  We were told to request housekeeping at the front  desk as they didn't clean the rooms otherwise.  Well even after requesting it several times the  room was not cleaned.  The bed covers are paper thin. I know it's Hawaii  but if you had the air con on you were freezing, if  you had the air con off it was boiling. A blanket  would've made for a nice sleep.  The balcony was falling apart and the exterior is  in massive need of a repaint.  Rooms have floorboards and we had a child  above us who ran across the floor all night  keeping us awake. You literally could hear it like  an elephant stomping across the ceiling.  Check your bills because what was quoted and  what was charged was very different. They say it's  ""hold"" but it was far in excess of what we had  booked (and the $200 incidentals hold) so really  don't understand the additional $$. And staff just  kept saying it was the conversion. I don't think an  additional $700 is the conversion between USD  and AUS.  Don't expect any luxury for a 4 star hotel,  cupboards are misaligned, curtains broken and  some fellow guests told us that no manager works  on a weekend. Seems bizarre to me.  If you're looking to stay in Hawaii, there are a  million other options, go with one of them.

We stayed in one of the Gold Kitchenette rooms which was good to have if you want to cook yourself something. If you want housekeeping you need to book that with the front desk 24 hours in advance. We were able to ask for fresh towels. When we did request housekeeping they only made the beds and added fresh towels.

Almost no furniture. Fridge and freezer good, though.    Pool very nice, if crowded with kids.    No coffee in room. Had to get coffee in lobby, which did not open till 6 (11 am Central). Jet-lagging Americans coming to Hawaii from mainland, be warned.    Parking a problem. Either $42 valet (which we gained access to only by sending a text) in same building with in/out privileges or $24/day across the street without. But the elevator there was closed pending redo of building. So we hauled our own bags up the garage ramp.    Location good.    Booking.com says ‚ÄúHotel La Croix offers unobstructed views of the ocean.‚Äù From our 12th floor balcony, if we arched our necks, we could see a sliver of the beach 8 blocks away from between 2 high-rises.    Had they not wrongly raised expectations, we would have otherwise liked the view.    No one answers a phone. Texting required. So we could not call the desk for any help.    ‚ÄúRoom service‚Äù pizza required setting up an account (including credit card info) with a third party, placing order, ignoring where it says you will pick it up yourself, and paying $18 for rubbery worse-than-frozen food.

843620342,10,Would not recommend,"I dont usually write reviews online but i had to because this hotel did not lived up to any of my expectations (which is not even high) and had to caution anyone who is thinking to book. I decided to book this hotel after looking at the reviews here on Tripadvisor and was looking forward to my stay. Arrived early but was only told that our rooms can be ready after 3pm and we asked if we can do an early check in to wash up but the receptionist said she was working alone and she does not know what to do. (Red Flag #1).    Checked into our rooms (standard king and double queen) and realised the floor of both rooms was so sticky that it made our feet so black while walking around, toilet flush was not working (fixed after texting (Red Flag #2) the front desk and going down to check with them). The bathroom knob is so old and hard to manipulate, everything is just very old and not maintained.    One of my night, I requested for a kettle of hot water over the front desk and it only came after 45 mins and multiple reminders. I find it so difficult to communicate with the front desk whenever we have problems because they would only do it over texting. The room had nothing (red flag #3), no coffee maker (at least we could use this to boil some water), no complimentary water whatsoever.    Also you cannot see any ocean view if you are staying here as the door to the balcony is locked and sealed.    Overall, my family did not enjoy this stay at all and was disappointed by the whole experience despite looking forward to our first time to Waikiki.

For a small increase I got the Ocean View Skyline Penthouse with kitchenette (comes with Monkeypod Room access).  Employees are very friendly and accommodations, changes, food order are done via website and they text! I was updated with food ordering, specials (happy hour at the pool bar). They have a salt water infinity pool, sauna and a small excessive room.  Conveniently located riggt off Kuhio and Kalakaua. Across from Ft DeRussy so the ocean views were great.  Access to the Monkeypod Room provides small refreshments and pastries. Really nice because we could stock a few things for overnight.

If you have no other option for a hotel and want to find really cheap place, this is the place. Also, you have to pay for resort fee that you don't even use.

840119533,20,Misleading pictures and mouldy bathroom. Old hotel,"The purpose of this review is to warn travellers. I don't ever write bad reviews - I'm someone who always grins and bears with bad stays/food/service but I feel that this is necessary in order to warn people and not let this hotel ruin their beautiful holiday in Hawaii.    Like many others, i felt that the pictures for this hotel looked like it would be a decent and comfortable stay. However be warned that the pictures are only for the very few more expensive and higher quality/renovated rooms. My actual experience was a small room (even for Oahu or Tokyo standards), shoddy furniture and finishings and mouldy bathroom with zero ventilation (no fan, no windows) and the actual room looked nothing like their marketing pictures.    My advice: you're already going to Hawaii and chances are you've spent quite a bit of money on air tickets and even more time planning the trip. just pay a little more for a nicer, more established hotel. There are lots in the same area    The only ventilation for the bathroom was the door, which means that all smells from the bathroom would go into the bedroom (only place for the smells to go).. not pleasant.    My bf and I found ourselves dreading to go back to our room every day which in retrospect actually forced us to stay out and explore more, but the prospect of going back to a dirty/mouldy room definitely put a dampener on our trip.    If I'd been prepared and wasn't misled by the pictures, l would not be writing this review as it would've been on me if I knowingly booked a shoddy room. However this was not the case at all.    I suspect that the high reviews are from people who got upgraded to the penthouses or better rooms.    Also there are glowing reviews on the staff but that honestly wasn't my experience. The front desk staff on duty in the day seem crabby for no reason (I promise I was very pleasant to them for the whole stay despite everything) but we did seem to have better interactions with the front desk staff who were on duty at night.    I read a review from someone else who'd said that there was a front desk girl who was ""snarky"" and I now know what she meant.    On our last night there, we encountered a couple on the elevator who looked honestly as defeated and sad as us and overheard the guy saying that they were checking out early because they were unhappy with their room.    The manager Craig did reach out to us on our last day but it was too late at that point. We'd repeatedly provided feedback (via text) to the front desk staff from the first day that we checked in, only to be told by them via text that there was nothing they could do.    We did appreciate Craig letting us check out early so that we could move to another hotel. Things were so much better after we moved.    Summary of our stay  -Moldy shower curtain, moldy faucet, moldy showerhead (pics attached)  -Stained bathtub  -Very stale and mouldy smell throughout  -No ventilation in bathroom  -All bathroom smells would travel to bedroom due to no ventilation  -Cramped room that did not feel like it was the size as advertised  -No housekeeping unless you request for it. To me the purpose of choosing a hotel over a rental is to not have to worry about housekeeping at all and a hotel perk is to leave your room and have it clean when you come back, without having to ask for it  -Creaky bed  -Thin walls and patio door. Be prepared to hear traffic at all hours  -Musty and stained carpet  -Bathrook sink is not marble as per the marketing pictures  -Front desk staff keeps saying there's nothing they can do  -Only one working elevator - although they did say that they are repairing the rest. We did have to wait 15-20 mins on our first day as only one elevator was working and it stopped on every floor  -Safe is weirdly located in the bathroom and didn't work - we had to get maintenance to come up twice to fix it    Pictures attached.",May 2022,May 2022,Traveled as a couple,,

The hotel is also in the middle of renovations, and from what I saw they are improving and will soon compete with the luxury hotels on the strip. We stayed here from May 2, 2022 to May 9, 2022.    The best part about our stay, was the hotel staff. Everyone was kind, helpful, and truly made us feel like we were at home.    - Mhila, our cleaning lady, quickly attended to our room and was so kind. She even set up a beautiful swan fashioned from towels to wish my partner and I a Happy Anniversary.  - Bea and Craig, the front desk receptionists, were always happy to give us recommendations on where to eat, where to visit and would follow up on our adventures when we returned to the hotel. They were keen to hear about our activities and greeted us enthusiastically whenever we left or returned to the hotel.  - Dave, Nelson, and Rodel were also extremely helpful and kind in our interactions whether it was at the bar, at valet parking, or even in passing in the hallways.  - Vince, the pool bar attendant, absolutely did everything he could to make us feel at home. A beautiful soul, and a hilarious conversationalist. My partner and I would regularly visit the pool just to see Vince and hear his recommendations, and to sip on great cocktails (we loved the Ube Colada!).  - All the gentlemen who worked as the valets, were happy to help us with the car we had rented and always asked us how our day was and to enjoy our travels. Their services were quick, and our car was well taken care of during our stay.    Although I did not catch the names of every person we crossed paths with, I can honestly say that the people who work here are kind, genuine people that make you feel like you've known them for years.    Ever since we got home, we've been recommending this hotel to our friends and family and we will be coming back!

837879830,20,Pass on staying in Wikiki,Booked a room here for our last family vacation (May 2022). We were disappointed. The room was clean! But....  1) rooms were much smaller than what the picture lets on  2) they wouldn't allow us to get a rollaway  3) showers were warm..never hot and only gave us 3 bath towels  4)had to pay additional to park here- that was a fun surprise at $39.95 a night  5) had to pay a resort fee for ever night ($29.95) even tho they only will clean your room upon request  6) if you do end up staying here make sure you have ear plugs- VERY noisy outside.

One instance we had made a little mess, and Rolly was able to let us use his mop and broom to clean up. We were on the 4th floor so right by the pool, and had a beautiful view of the city with palm trees. Extra bonus that our room had two balconies!!

While the staff are friendly, the place is clean and the location is good, the ongoing renovation and construction are an inconvenience. Imagine taking a nap after a sunrise hike of Diamond Head, only to wake up to a drill going into a concrete wall on the other side of your headboard. I would have absolutely not booked this hotel, had I known.    Also, beware, not all of their rooms are renovated. Based on the confusion at check-in, most folks seem to be tricked by the pictures on their site of the already renovated rooms, that meet the 4-star criteria. The rooms that are yet to be renovated give a lipstick-on-a-pig vibe of a 2-star motel. The gal at checkin was snarky when I said I wasn‚Äôt sure which type of room I booked, telling me that I should‚Äôve checked if it‚Äôs a renovated category or not. My gosh, I just want a vacation, not to be an expert on the status of your reno.    Pool is small, pool deck crowded.    Text messages with happy hour invites and other nonsense were an inconvenience that I don‚Äôt remember agreeing to at check-in.    Anyways, it was fine, I won‚Äôt stay here again.

But once I mentioned it was my birthday to pool bartender Vincent Royo, he and the staff made me feel so safe and loved! They even set up a beautiful flower towel arrangement and delicious chocolate-covered macadamia nuts while I was out by the pool! I will NEVER forget that!    The hotel is in the heart of Waikiki. It's walking distance from beautiful shores, great food options (with a wide price range if you're on a budget), and shopping stores. It's also an easy pick-up spot for excursions and pretty close to Diamond Head in case you want to hike up an extinct volcano :).    This place will be seeing me again.

We used the Costco Travel website and discovered the Hotel La Croix. Based on the price and reviews, we booked our stay.    When we arrived at the hotel, we were helped by Emily. She was not only polite and personable, she was very efficient. Our room wasn‚Äôt ready, so she checked our bags and asked us to return about 3:00 PM.    When we arrived back at the hotel, Bea was working at the front desk. She too was amazing. Personable and attentive.    After checking in, we went to our room, which was on the 15th floor. The room was basic, but immaculately clean and maintained.    We are on day 2 of a 7 day stay. Each and every time we walk by the front desk we are warmly greeted by a member of staff.    All aspects of Waikiki, from dining to shopping, are a short walk from the hotel.    This is not the Ritz Carlton, however the staff makes you feel like you are staying there.

835664708,30,"Excellent staff, but not comfortable stay","I have to say that the staff was excellent. They were very friendly, accommodating, quick to respond to texts for service requests, and professional.    Pros:  - Great staff  - The room was clean  - Location, if you want to be in the Waikiki area but not quite in the thick of it, this is a good place to stay, it's at the end of the main strip.    Cons:  - Even with the windows closed, the street noise was really loud at night.    The hotel has gone through recent renovations:  - What seemed to be already done, was done so poorly. For example: everything was mounted crooked, light switches, shower fixture, sink fixtures, were all obviously crooked. The door was painted, but not the door jambs. There was a missing rail on one of the balconies, and the center divider on the 2nd balcony was zip-tied in place. The shower wasn't tiled properly, no matter how careful you were about positioning the shower head away from the outside, it would leave a big puddle of water on the floor, we were constantly wiping the floor with towels. The furniture was very random and not comfortable. There is a desk but no desk chair, only one end table for a king size bed in the center of the room. A single chair with ottoman, but no side table. Wall scones that were mismatched. It felt like they ran out of furniture and placed random pieces in the room.    If I were the owner, I would not find the construction or design acceptable; they are easy fixes and unfortunately really lower the value of the property.",Apr 2022,April 2022,,,"Los Angeles, California"

It seems like a vast majority of them are from privileged guests that stayed on the 15th floor in Platinum or Penthouse rooms and had MonkeyPod access. These reviews are not representative of the lower floors.    My room on the 8th floor (new elevator signage incorrectly said 10th floor) faced north overlooking 5 lanes of traffic! The intersection between Kalakaua and K≈´hi≈ç avenues is extremely busy. Not a minute went by without hearing a car horn or a motorcycle rev it‚Äôs engine. The single pane windows and glass doors did not block out any of the noise. I felt like I was in a New York City hotel. There are many other options in Waikiki that are on quieter streets that would provide a more tranquil vacation experience.    To add insult to injury, the room just next to mine was being renovated and the frequent sound of power tools made my stay even more unpleasant.    Unfortunately the pool was disappointing as well. Twice I had to shorten my time there due to the noise of construction from a room just above the pool deck. One afternoon the staff arrived an hour late to hand out towels!

I had not paid enough attention and booked a room without a balcony so was thrilled when they let us switch to a room with a balcony at no cost when one came available.

She booked my week long stay with a special professional flair that made me lock in with Hotel La Croix by allowing me to see the room ahead of time and following up with me to secure the hold of the reservation. My sisters and I loved the feel of the room, no cookie-cutter atmosphere at this hotel! We were on the fourth floor, which happens to be on the same floor as the infinity pool, and there was zero noise due to the placement of the pool and closed glass doors--which has a great view by the way and poolside service. The sauna was a huge bonus for me; reservations required, but available. Valet was convenient.

My room had a balcony, but the door was bolted shut. I could not use it but I paid for it. Granted they are doing some renovations to improve the hotel, and we just happened to visit at that time, but also there was constant construction noise and we traveled with an 11 month old baby. The hotel itself tried to be accommodating to our needs, but Trip Advisor did a terrible job of including current information regarding the state of the hotel so that we could make an informed decision on where we‚Äôd like to stay based upon our needs.

831456891,40,Our wonderful stay at Hotel La Croix Waikiki‚Ä¶,"We stayed at Hotel La Croix for six nights and it was a wonderful stay. Staff is very friendly and helpful and always greeted us as we entered or left the building. Special call outs to Christopher, Precious and Annie from reservations! The rooms are clean and modern. The bathroom is huge. We did have a Platinum Terrace Oceanview Room so our terrace was a lovely extended space to the hotel room especially for a family of four. Valet was prompt. Usually needing no more than 10 mins to get our vehicle which is more than fair when texting from the room. The pool is a bit small but it was clean and empty for most of the day until around 4pm when beach goers would come back. Wifi was great we were able to stream Netflix etc with no issues. They have microwaves in the lobby and in the club lounge for gold and platinum guests. As well as free hot brewed coffee in the lobby as well. The only reason we did not give 5/5 stars:  1). The elevators are slow but it is mostly due to only 2/3 working as they are upgrading their elevators. We didn‚Äôt mind too much because we are on holiday but you should factor this if you have time commitments and include an additional 5 minutes if you have to go somewhere. They are also loud. Our room is directly in front of the elevators and I can hear the chiming and the motor of the elevator going up and down. I don‚Äôt mean people going in and out loud, but the actual mechanics. I wear ear plugs at night when I travel so it was no issue.. it didn‚Äôt wake me up but for people who are light sleepers, this could be an issue.  2). For a fam of four the room itself has plenty of space with two queens and the extra large terrace and bathroom is great. But there is no storage. There are not dressers or closets. Only hangers in the bathroom. So for most of the week we lived out of our suitcases (which during covid is what we do anyway) but there was limited room to place 4 carryons so we wind up using the ironing board to help as well as on a chair. We also propped on on the luggage rack. I‚Äôm not a fan of putting my suitcase directly on the floor opened.  3). Our room included the Monkey Pod lounge which was lovely and we always grabbed waters from there to use the next day. However the hours of 9am to 7pm made it difficult to truly enjoy as we are from the east coast and often are gone by 7-8am to enjoy the island and so we weren‚Äôt able to really get any real benefit from the lounge. My kids would grab a quick snack when we returned in the late afternoon but it would have been nice to enjoy the fancy coffee machines first thing in the morning.    But other than that, our 6 days were very enjoyable and I would definitely consider staying here again if we picked the same room.

831315890,50,Exceptional customer service - great location,"My husband & I decided to stay here for our first trip to Hawaii and we were not disappointed. The hotel is located in a great location - not too close to all the tourists going on about their day, but not too far to join them too. We were about a 7-10 minute drive (25 min walk) to Waikiki Beach which was convenient.    Check-in was painless, we arrived exhausted from a long trip, and we were quickly checked in and settled into a cute little room. The room was clean & bright. The bathroom was nice as well - but be warned, the door to the bathroom is a wooden sliding door, which has a BIG gap - if you‚Äôre not comfortable with the person(s) you‚Äôre staying with‚Ä¶have fun lol. I‚Äôve read reviews about being on the 15th floor and being bothered by the noise on the street (????????) I literally have no idea what they‚Äôre talking about because we didn‚Äôt experience any of that (we were also on the 15th floor).    The pool was nice and there‚Äôs a sauna and gym available too. We didn‚Äôt spend much time using those facilities but they‚Äôre definitely clean and available.    The staff is AMAZING - front desk was super helpful & pleasant. The cleaning staff was always so friendly when we came across them. I do really want to point out Smiles Miles who worked the valet during the week we were there. He was always so pleasant when we had seen him and managed to have the most interesting conversations in such a short time! He gave us many places to visit & we‚Äôre so grateful for the recommendations. The other valet gentlemen were exceptional as well! We were told we were allowed to use some of the swimming stuff located in the parking lot (SO HELPFUL!!!) & my husband had left his phone in the car multiple times - I think they got so used to him leaving it behind that they almost started looking for it once we exited the car lol.    Overall our first trip to Hawaii is one to remember, and we‚Äôre honestly thankful & grateful for having stayed at Hotel La Croix. We will for sure be back again!

831285247,40,Good value,"My husband and I have just spent 2 weeks at La Croix hotel Waikiki.  Overall we found it to be good value for money, clean and in a good location.  Renovations are going on throughout the hotel, we did not have a newly renovated room, however, it was in a reasonable condition.  Our room was a very good size, although the bathroom was very small.  Shower over bath which I‚Äôm not a fan of.  There were drawers in bathroom for storage which was good.  Bed was a king size, small square pillows and bedding was nice and comfortable.  Funky green generous sized refrigerator/freezer and coffee machine provided, we requested and received a kettle for use during our stay.  There were 4 USB charging points in our room and a large power pack for charging electronic devices.  1 balcony faced a small park and the city, the other over other buildings.  Air con worked ok for the size of the room however it was not extremely hot while we were there.  A small ABC store is downstairs which was handy for basic meals, snacks, drinks and any forgotten travel items.  In the lobby, the hotel provides a microwave, toaster and water/ice machine.  Tea and coffee facilities are set up morning and night.  In the basement there is a large ice machine and washer/dryers for guest use. These take cards and cost $3.50 per use.  For those that know Waikiki, La Croix is on Kalakaua Ave and Olohana St, opposite Ambassador hotel, Ala Moana end of town.  It is a short walk to the main shopping/dining/ beach area. Trolley and bus stops right outside.  Eggs and things, Hard Rock Cafe and a great little bar/restaurant called Arnold‚Äôs are just across the road.  Housekeeping was done every 3rd day during our visit, reduced service due to Covid.  Although clean, housekeeping was very inconsistent with replacing used items such as soap, face cloths, coffee items etc, requiring many repeated requests.  Rooms do not have phones so you have to go to front desk to make any requests.  Waikiki can be noisy at night, emergency services sirens seem to be continuous so maybe bring ear plugs if a light sleeper!  The pool was small, which is sadly common in Waikiki.  A few lounge chairs available.  The pool is a nice temperature, clean and a modern area with a pool bar just opened. They serve a limited range of cocktails and drinks at reasonable prices, plus a small food menu which you can also have delivered to your room.  We found most of the staff to be very warm, welcoming and friendly.  We had an issue over a couple of days where renovations caused a damaged pipe, and our bathroom got very wet.  Staff were very apologetic and quick to fix the issue and made sure our bathroom was clean and replenished promptly.  Although inconvenient, these things happen and we tried to not let it spoil our stay.  There are 3 elevators which are being upgraded so only 2 working but this did not cause too many delays.  I would return to La Croix, post renovations, if the price remains good value.

829882164,20,"Good service, bad room","I stayed in a ""Silver King"" room for three nights in February. While there are pros, namely the service, it was a poor experience overall due to: noise, cockroaches, furnishings, and pool hours.    First, I'll start with the service. It was attentive and high quality. The staff shine and clearly care about guests and their work. The cleaning service was thorough.    Unfortunately, the room was bad. It faced a busy highway and there was no sound insulation. Every honk, ambulance sound, and party noise was loudly audible despite being 15 floors up. To be clear, we're young travellers with experiences in hostels and loud hotels in developing countries. This was the loudest hotel I've stayed in. After the first night, we complained to the front desk, and were told ""there's no quieter room"" to be moved to.    I understand that cockroaches are common in Hawaii, however, a brief consult with online resources shows that hotels universally have pest management programs that prevent guests from coming into contact. After the first night, we spoke with the front desk about the cockroach infestation and were told it would be dealt with. However, the problem came back, and we had to ask for our room to be treated a second time. We asked to change rooms, and were told that cockroaches were common in Hawaii. No offer to accommodate or apology.    Finally, there are functional oddities with the property. For instance, at our king bed, there was a side table for the left side but not the right. Not having a side table for one guest means putting water, phone, glasses, etc on the floor. Further, the pool was lovely, but for some reason it closed at 7PM; other properties we stayed in closed their pools at 10PM. This meant limited enjoyment of the amenity.    I really want to like this property. The staff are good, the pool is nice, and the design modern. But untreated cockroach infestation, noise that made sleep impossible, and poor room furnishing made for an unpleasant experience. We even complained repeatedly early in our stay, without resolution.    To dramatically improve, the hotel should consider: (1) installing double pane windows on rooms facing noisy streets; (2) aggressively treat cockroaches; (3) add tables to both sides of beds; and (4) extend pool hours to at least 10PM.",Mar 2022,February 2022,,,Ottawa

We like the text messaging inquiry. No long phone waiting.  Pet policy was reasonable after getting the online booking discount. They adore animals so bring yours here.  Atmosphere was nature inspired and relaxing. Beds were firm.    Unfortunately, if you want quiet time, you may need to wait until they finish renovation because there was intense drilling in the day time. But if you'll be out anyway during the day, it shouldn't be an issue.    Also, if you bring your pet, only certain rooms accommodates them, so just make sure you ask about the room you get assigned to.    So glad they have salt water pool. It's so much better than fully chlorinated for the body. And the sauna is big and gets you sweating good.    If you want your own little cool hideaway with snacks water coffee hot cocoa and even espresso, the Monkey pod room was worth it. Only thing is it opens late at 9 am. So hours wete not for the business traveler.    Little note on the bathroom. Please be careful because the tub was very slippery. Maybe the hotel can look into putting slip guards in the tub for more safety.

826216490,50,Last minute bday gift,"My daughter was turning 9 years old and wanted to do a lot of activities in the Waikiki area. Since it would require a lot of time we decided last minute to stay the night instead of cut our day short to leave to go home through traffic. I‚Äôve stayed at this hotel before and honestly it was the first place that came to mind. I love it for its super convenient location and its cute beachy themed decor. I was amazed at how easy it was to get a room same day and was even able to check-in early. We were already off to a good start. What made our stay exceptional was the kind and wonderful staff who went out of their way to wish my Princess a happy birthday and even surprised her with a little treat in our room upon arrival. Check-in was smooth and quick, lots of street parking within walking distance (or there is hotel parking for a fee), and the amenities made our stay extremely comfortable. Our beds felt like sleeping in the clouds. We had two balconies that overlooked the pool and the park. We also chose a room with a kitchenette (not all rooms have kitchenettes) which made being away from home easier. Being able to text the concierge for answers to general questions was super cool. Reserving a time to use the gym (due to covid restrictions) wasn‚Äôt a problem. We had so much fun and will surely be back again.",Jan 2022,January 2022,Traveled with family,,
826152198,30,Hotel La Croix was not as advertised,"Hotel La Croix is listed as a 4/5 Star hotel rating. The majority of the staff there are 5/5 - very helpful and pleasant - but IMHO the hotel room itself is closer to 2 to 3/5 Stars. The hotel‚Äôs promo images show things like spacious bathrooms with glass enclosed showers - I stayed in three different rooms there including one in the penthouse and all had plastic shower curtains. (Their Pool Area had a nice bath with glass shower and might have been the spot used for advertising photos.) Many rooms and public areas had old, worn carpets that reminded me of high-traffic airport carpeting. The Penthouse wood floor had some dangerously raised planks to catch your feet, and a toilet that required several minutes between double - tap flushes to work effectively. Ceilings are low, with some exposed fire-suppression sprinkler heads & pipes. The two (of three) elevators that worked were slow to serve 18 floors and noisy - (think: the sound of a car alternately accelerating and braking in stop-start city traffic) - unnervingly loud at night particularly in the penthouse level and rooms near the elevators. Views from upper levels were nice, but the lanai / balconies were tiny. Many room furnishings were ‚Äúeclectic‚Äù to the point of seemingly being garage sale finds. For positive points: the staff (overall) was helpful, the hotel‚Äôs physical location is convenient, and the bed was comfortable. The pool is attractive and looks towards the sunset, but access hours are 10-7, and more than a few occupants or rowdy guests keep it from being a place to relax. Outdoor spa is closed for repairs. Other amenities like gym and sauna are limited because they are by ‚Äúsign-up‚Äù only. The hotel management says the hotel is currently being renovated (new elevator lifts and room repairs are underway), but prospective guests would do well to preview their room first rather than assume the rooms shown in the promotional video in the lobby or online will be what they get.",Jan 2022,January 2022,Traveled as a couple,,

826007021,40,Overall great stay and successful family trip in Waikiki,"*****UPDATED REVIEW    My family stayed at this hotel for 4 nights and booked 2 separate rooms, with each room having 2 queen-sized beds.    Pros:  - Hotel location  - Nice pool  - Friendly staff  - ABC store located in the same building    Cons:  - No phones in the room for room service (found out after our stay that we had to request for room services via text message)  - No microwave‚Äîone microwave downstairs in the lobby area (found out in the middle of our stay that microwaves and Keurigs are only available in the Kitchenette room), no iron/iron board (probably by request only)  - Parking garage maximum height clearance 6 feet  - Limited food menu options  - Walls are thin    My family had a respectable stay at Hotel LaCroix. We experienced some delay checking in at normal check-in time. The walls are thin, and renovation was happening next door to one of the rooms. We could not park at the hotel parking garage since our car rental was taller than the height clearance (6 feet). It would be useful to have that information/details on the website. Luckily, there is a parking garage (King Kalakaua Plaza) across the street with a maximum height clearance of 8 feet where we parked our car rental.    My favorite accommodations about this hotel were the friendly staff, hotel location, free rentals of beach towels, beach gear, and the infinity pool. Service could use some improvement, but overall the staff was very pleasant during our stay. This hotel also accommodated my friends who made last-minute reservations for one night.    After speaking to Craig, he was open to hearing my feedback and suggestions on improved accommodation. We had a great conversation, and I provided my input on what could make our stay become an excellent one next time.

Having said that I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs much the same elsewhere unless you‚Äôre 20-25 floors up. The 5-7 minute walk across the park to the beach was lovely. Great amenities like pool and sauna. Beds were extremely comfortable. That if anything is very important to us. We like a good nights sleep!    We wanted somewhere where we didn‚Äôt have to go out for breakfast every morning so we chose a room with a kitchenette. It was a little disappointing that a room for up to 4 people didn‚Äôt have little table to sit around and have breakfast. After having asked front desk for a table they promptly sent one up. That leads me inevitably in to how well they looked after us. Great service and Bea was always smiling behind her face mask. ;)  All in all I have no hesitation in recommending La Croix to any likeminded people out there.

They are still renovating the hotel. The existing elevators are very old and need to be replaced badly which they are doing now. They are loud and we had to play white noise to drown out the elevator noise which on the penthouse floor is extremely loud, probably on the other floors too.

Lobby is small, it is a small hotel, where do you hang out on all these rainy days? Only upside is when you complain, they respond asap. But they can only do so much with what they have. Hotel is not modern, fixtures and paint job is so sloppy I can spot it a mile away. I am not writing this review because I am mad, merely to give you a useful tip I wish I had because I did not enjoy the trip partially because of this hotel. Go stay in a chain hotel and you‚Äôll thank me. I was scratching my head on how I wound up here and I looked online and don‚Äôt see enough bad reviews. Just like house shopping, look at pictures of the bathroom and kitchens and you‚Äôll know how well the house is. Scrutinize the bathrooms. Truth lies there. I keep my sandals on In the room cuz I didn‚Äôt trust the carpeting to be clean. I am not those types that complain all the time but because of this hotel I must. The staff is indeed attentive and nice. Valet was efficient and I tipped them every single time. It‚Äôs not their fault.",Jan 2022,January 2022,Traveled as a couple,,

823217477,30,Property appears to be undergoing renovation (Dec 2021),"Nice hotel in a decent location a few blocks from the beach that is in the process of being rehabbed- would've been great if this info was shared by the property via their website, social media, or even an email. Hopefully the older sliding glass doors are replaced as part of this process, ours let in a little bit more noise than expected- we could clearly hear the rooster across the street every morning. Pool is a bit small (can only lounge, no room to swim or play), hot tub was never open during our visit. Sauna was great once it completely warmed up which is about a 90min process.    Staff was very friendly and went out of their way to help us with a couple of issues, the company was very fair compensating us after the fact. Was told by a hotel rep that that new operating procedures are being written for staff and they'll consider providing real-time property condition updates on their website so guests aren't surprised upon arrival.

821716248,50,Yessir!,"Booked a room last minute due to our neighbors house unfortunately catching on fire, and I was paranoid of the amount of carbon monoxide my baby was inhaling, as our house was filled with smoke.    The whole experience was great, from the valet, to checking in & out. We arrived a bit late around 10pm (yes that‚Äôs late for us lol our new bed time as parents is 8pm) & the valet was friendly and knowledgeable. They asked for our names and then took our car to park it. We‚Äôre locals but we‚Äôre from the west side and I got sketched out thinking about leaving our car in town. However, the parking facility looked safe & secure. I had no worries about our car.    Walking up to the desk to get checked in, we were greeted by a man who helped us. He was amazing! Extremely friendly & so helpful. He really helped us ease up a bit and lighten our mood as we were just tired & stressed out. He got us checked in promptly and informed us about the hotel and room we were staying in. He made us feel like we were in good hands here, and expressed his sympathy for our situation. My husband & I appreciate his kindness so so so much. He really made our night & stay honestly. I wish I could remember his name!! When we come back here I hope he‚Äôs still here so I can tell him thank you.    We got the bronze room, which is one of the cheaper rooms as we were only going to be staying for one night, but it didn‚Äôt look cheap at all. The room was also not freezing cold & at a warm temp which I really liked, it‚Äôs something small but something I noticed. Super welcoming & comfortable. We went to shower to wash off the smoke smell & they have bomb shampoo and conditioner LOL. Literally I‚Äôm going to ask them if they sell it in bulk because this is the only shampoo and conditioner that has worked for my curly hair. Who woulda thought hotel toiletries would be so good!    Ordered Uber eats, so I had to go to the front outside the hotel and forgot that after 10pm the doors lock so you need your key card to open it (I had my key card just forgot so I was trying to open the automatic doors just by standing by it) and the man from the desk started to walk to come help me til I realized I just need to scan my card. So I do think they watch the cameras around the hotel, just reassuring me it was safe & secure.    We really enjoyed our stay here. It was a nice & relaxing environment to be in after what had happened. The room was comfortable and relaxing, no problems with noise at all. My baby enjoyed the street view a lot and watching the cars pass by. Street view might not be the view some people want, but we liked it. There‚Äôs a lot of food places within walking distance as well, we walked to a restaurant in the morning to get some air & made it back within 5-10 minutes.    Mahalo you guys for the amazing stay!

Kudos to the teams including maintenance as there were some renovations happening.    Big big shout outs to Emily, Noah, Kris, Craig, and Bea at front desk and to Mhila and Romelia as housekeeping.  Emily helped us from before our actual visit - a phone call re booking that sealed the deal for us. Emily is fantastic - cheerful, answered Qs, gave us info, ensured we were able to book the room we wanted, and checked in with us after we arrived and sent us updates. Knew our names. Always greeted with a smile (even though masked due to pandemic!). And even a card when we left.  Bea was awesome at check in and was excited for our stay. And always cheerful and pleasant. Bea and Emily told us some great local Hawaiian spots to eat at.  Noah gave us some tips and shared some stories. quick to answer texts and had packages sent up to us when we were in and they arrived from Amazon.  Kris was always helpful and efficient. Able to help us send some mail and even find a stamp! Borrowed his wine bottle opener a few times - saved the day!  Craig shared some stories of Oahu and some of his favourite Japanese places to eat.    Mhila and Romelia kept our room clean and fresh. Housekeeping during pandemic is once every 3 days but can get service as needed and we had evening turn down service with water and chocolates. Fresh changes of towels. Very sweet ladies.    Hotel La Croix has a texting service since there are no phones in the rooms. This is. Awesome service. Use it to ask Qs. Connect with front staff. Book use of the gym (max 2 people at a time and Covid safe). Fast responses.    We booked penthouse terrace number 3 ‚Äòekolu. We had read online that these rooms in the corners on 16th floor were awesome. Best room in our opinion. Clean room and bathroom recently renovated. Great lanai with expansive views, good size room, air con works well. The lanai is set up with loungers and normal seats. Great for sunrise and lazy days.  Some noise from street below and elevators but not loud.    The monkeypod lounge on the 16th floor just launched at Hotel La Croix for Gold room and Platinum rooms (15th and 16th and 17th floors I think). A great space to chill and get some refreshments/snack/Nescaf√© coffees. Microwave and ice. Cold drinks. It‚Äôs like a cute club lounge.    Location is great. Close to a lot of eating. Beach. Transit if needed. Shops.    Anyhow, I could go on but will leave it at that. Would definitely go back. If you‚Äôre looking for a stay at a fun hotel, good location, good prices, and really awesome staff - stay here. And if you can, book PH terrace 3! And get to know the staff.

I checked their website and was impressed. I booked the hotel stay, a silver room, to celebrate my wife and I's 7th wedding anniversary. During booking, everyone was extremely helpful and, more importantly, very patient with me. On the day of, my wife and I were ready to get started. They allowed us to check-in early for a $50 fee, but they offered us a complementary upgrade to a gold corner room. Thank you!    I dropped my wife off while I went to park the car on the street. They checked us in and we were good to go. The room was a great size. The A/C was really good and strong. The TV selections were great. We enjoyed the fridge and matching Keurig. There was great water pressure. The pool area was small but when we went there were only 3 other people there so it worked out great and comfortable.    Highlights & Complements:  - The staff was very kind, helpful, patient, and generous.  - They have a number to text where you can communicate with the staff for any necessities you need.  - They offered us access to the Monkeypod Room since we were celebrating our wedding anniversary.

It sits on its own block with no hotels stuck next to it. We have stayed here 5 or 6 times and have never had a room we didn't like. The beach at Fort Derusy is great for swimming and surfing. It's usually less crowded than Waikiki as well. We find everything is within walking distance to eat and shop and rarely take our car from valet. You should definitely try this place.

MIhla made sure we had all we needed and made sure that our rooms remained with fresh towels, water, and everything else!    We were beyond grateful for the valet staff as they were all SO helpful and kind.

And a special shoutout to all the house keeping staff, especially aunty Vangie, Jeff, Rodel, Rene, and Rhea! You guys are an absolute gems!!!    Now as for the hotel itself...    Room: Platinum city view terrace with two beds    Pro: The room was beautiful with lots of room and a big balcony. The AC was very cold and clean. The bathroom was huge! And the beds were very comfortable!    Con: Our room was right in front of the elevator, so its very loud whenever someone was using it.    Feedback: maybe a soundproof door, to block out the noise.    Balcony:    Pro: The balcony view was very beautiful with lots of space!    Con: There was only one chair on the balcony    Feedback: Would love to have more chairs and maybe a little table so more people could hangout and watch the view together    Bathroom:    Pro: Bathroom was very spacious    Con: there was not enough table or bench area to put stuff on for a family of three. The bathroom door cannot be fully close and the some of the window was very clear that people could see through. Some people might not feel comfortable with that especially when they are travel with their friends/family.    Feedback: maybe tint more windows to give the people more privacy in the bathroom. And adjust the bathroom door so that it will close fully.    Overall, the staff is 100/10, but the room definitely need a few adjustment. So a 3/5 for me.

We stayed in the Gold Corner studio, 15th floor, which was spacious and brightly lit. It was also quiet as we never heard the neighbours and only gets somewhat noisy if you leave the patio door open.  Pros  - The mini fridge was fairly large and came in handy  - Workout room was small but had what I needed  - Pool was on the smaller size, but still a nice option for those not headed to the beach  - TV fairly new and worked well  - Bed was comfortable  - Staff was amazing, always friendly and helpful.  - Coffee in the morning was a nice touch  - Location was good. Great restaurants were only a few blocks away, same with the beach.    Cons  - bit of a musty smell to the room on arrival. I recommend bringing a little bottle of air freshener and/or airing out the place by opening the patio door for a while  - comforter was super thin, but we asked for a new one and they had someone bring up a replacement asap    Overall, this a straight forward hotel with some nice touches and, above all else, really great staff members who were always super friendly and helpful.",Oct 2021,October 2021,,,"Edmonton, Canada"

814802748,50,Staff Kind But Loud Hotel,"Room: We stayed at the 17th floor (penthouse) of Hotel LaCroix.    Pros: Penthouse is a very nice size and the view is very cool at night. We had a city view. It gets hot because of the glass and elevation but the curtains made it cool. The bed is comfortable and the staff is very very kind and accommodating. Our cleaner Mhila also did a great job with cleaning and we really appreciated the turndown service (waters and chocolates).    Cons: It gets very loud at night. We heard the elevators whenever they were running and there are crazy chickens that are screaming every morning. In addition we initially had the silver king room and it was small. The AC would also blow out air that was smelly.    location:    Location is pretty good. It is on more of the outskirt side but it's a short walk to the busy streets of Waikiki. Closest restaurants include Ramen Nakamura, Tommy Bahamas, and Hard Rock Cafe.    amenities:    Pros:  There is free coffee in the lobby in the morning and there is a microwave and water dispenser.    Cons:  Swimming pool in the pictures is a little deceptive. The pool probably can accommodate only 2-3 people at once. It's a small pool.    Overall I give this hotel a 5/5 because the staff is so kind and helpful and the reasonable price point*    helpful feedback for hotel:  It seems like certain staff knows certain things while others don't know. For example I asked for a shower cap and staff said that they weren't available on the property and to purchase it at the ABC store. But then magically there was shower caps in the bathroom one day. Balconies don't have a small coffee table I think the rooms would benefit from small tables a lot.",Oct 2021,October 2021,,Go for Penthouse if you have the money.

There is plenty of free street parking within a few blocks. However, read the reviews as I did. Our bathroom had a huge window with an ocean view but no window covering for privacy. This was not an issue for us but may be uncomfortable for some. Also, the hotel provided so many free amenities from coffee to beach chairs, snorkeling gear, beach umbrellas, towels, boogie boards and floaties.

Note also that although otherwise amazing, the penthouse rooms right across from the elevators will pick up the sounds of the elevator motors. each time they are in use. I think the machine room is above the penthouse.    Other than that; perfect! Be sure to check out Hotel Lacroix!",Oct 2021,October 2021,Traveled as a couple,,

He was moving in a huge pallet of supplies but still stopped and took the time to help me find my way (its either a bit confusing to find the lobby, or, I am easily confused). Super friendly. Next was the front desk gal, happy and bubbly. Next was Craig, one of the managers, I think, took time to point me in the right directions.

Staff was nice and friendly and the check-in, check-out, Vallet services were smooth and simple. It also helped that we could just text their dedicated number to avoid calling (no phones in rooms because of the pandemic).  Unfortunately, we were on the 4th floor and it was just so loud as this is the pool level and there were too many people for such a small pool, with wireless speakers. We could basically not stay in if that was the point of the trip.  The walls are extra thin, and despite the fact that the policy is for the swimming pool to close at 7pm, the hotel didn't enforce it.

Expect to pay resort fees for every night you are booked here and the valet parking is nice, but over $40 a night. Resort fees & parking fees cost more than the actual room. I liked it that we could get a roku for our stay and provide towels for the beach. The pool is tiny but well kept. The hot tub isn‚Äôt working and closed for the year. Sauna is nice, but bring your own water for the coals. Normally I stay at Outriggers since I live here they will waive the resort and parking fees, but not La Croix which I found extremely disappointing. When I got here I had a headache from the smell in the hallway and my room.

807579435,20,DO yourself a favor and DO NOT stay here,"This hotel was a major disappointment. While the staff was very friendly, the hotel itself is tired and dated. We paid extra for an ocean view which was a joke. You could not see the ocean while you were sitting in your room. You only saw it when you walked in the door to the room. Or sat out on the noisy balcony. The bathroom was a mixed bag. The vanity looked newer but the bathtub fixtures were old and the towel holders were coming out of the wall. The only plus was good water pressure in the shower.  The valet parking area in the basement smelled awful.  We will definitely not be returning to the Hotel LaCroix.

Hiroko from the hotel took my call and booked us on the 16th floor so we could have a view of the skyline and ocean. We did not spend a lot of time in the room, but, when we did, my kids loved to be out on the balcony and feel the breeze and view the ocean. We were so lucky to be at a location near popular dining spots and shopping. This helped us save costs on transportation. The best thing about our stay is the way that the hotel staff treated us. From the waitstaff to Noah, the manager, we felt the mantra of the hotel of Love & Aloha. Two very special people for us were Miles and Emily. Emily is a kindhearted, generous, smart, lovely young woman who will do everything to make your stay pleasant and comfortable. She adds an elegant personal touch to her actions and words. One morning I remember she showed up after I texted hospitality for extra towels -- she was knocking at our door with towels in hand, smiling, saying, ""I just didn't want you to have to wait for the waitstaff to get here."" She embodies love and aloha. Miles has an infectious smile and personality. He wants you to feel most welcome and will help you any way he can. He helped us through a challenging time when we got stuck at the Maui airport, making sure we were received back at the hotel in our same room and offering my husband a cup of tea to help through the headache (it was close to midnight!). We are very grateful to the wonderful people of Hotel LaCroix for making things as easy as possible for us during our stay.

791659593,40,"Convenient location, helpful staff but average room and a bit pricey for what you get","We stayed there the entire time of our stay. We picked this hotel after another hotel didn't work out. We were looking for a vacation rental as we wanted a kitchen but ended up choosing this hotel for a room with kitchenette. Room was decent sized at around 400 sq ft with 2 queen beds that was comfortable for our family of 4. There was a decent sized balcony with a street view. Not as much noise but not sure if it was due to reduced crowd or other reasons. We weren't disturbed.    Hotel staff were very friendly. Due to COVID restrictions, no regular housekeeping services unless you request it. Seems like that is common at present, so no complaints. When we needed the room cleaned or new towels, housekeeping was quick to respond.    Parking was the $35/night and in the same range as most other hotels.    An ABC store was there on the first floor so for quick supplies, snacks, etc. didn't have to go out of the hotel.    Some things that we took for granted at other hotels were missing - a full sized mirror outside the bathroom, phone in the room and ironing board (supposedly available on request). But reception was responsive to the desk number called from our mobile, and also had a number we could text to request any house keeping services. The only thing we really missed was a full size mirror outside the bathroom that would have helped a family of four to get ready quickly. :)    Was a short walk to the Waikiki beach and other facilities near by. Overall, it was a decent location but not sure if it was worth the price or not as we haven't stayed at any other hotels in the area to compare.",Jun 2021,May 2021,,,"Madison, Wisconsin"

HOWEVER...    Problem #1: This hotel was booked for hour honeymoon, which unfortunately we had to reschedule a year later because of Covid. The hotel was very understanding and gracefully never changed us more or less for rescheduling. NOTE: WE HAD BOOKED THIS HOTEL BECAUSE IT WAS ONE OF THE FEW THAT INCOUDED $25 per person BREAKFAST.

WE PAID AN ADDITIONAL $350 FOR BREAKFAST THAT WAS *NEVER* SERVED.    Problem #2: remember, this hotel may be more affordable than most in Waikiki, but it is older and crappier.

789819582,50,Great Stay for a Budget,"Although this review is long overdue, I think I should definitely give this place a good review based on my stay and experience last month. It was my first time visiting Hawaii and I compared all the hotels around Waikiki for the price and the amenities. Ultimately, I ended up choosing LaCroix and it was a great experience for a cheaper price compared to many other hotels in the area. We got there early in the morning and was able to leave our luggage at the hotel to check out the area. The room was decent sized with a view of the city. You can text the front desk to request room service and they would respond immediately. We were also able to borrow goggles and boogie boards when we head to the beach. They also had free coffee at night and in the morning. Our entire stay was under $700 and we were able to do a lot of other things with the money we saved on hotel. It takes about 15-20 mins walk to get to Waikiki and there is also another beach within 5 mins of walking. We couldn't park our rental car because parking was already full, but there was a parking garage in the next block and it was $15 to park from overnight, which was much cheaper than parking at any hotel around the area. I would definitely recommend this place for people who want to do many activities and want to save money but still stay at a nice place.",May 2021,April 2021,,,"Palo Alto, California"

Check-in and out was very easy and they also printed our Covid testing documents for us as we were going to another island after our stay. Coffee to go was an added bonus. We had no problem with parking. The spaces were tight - but I would say it's your standard city parking garage. The car was protected and we never had any issues or worried about the safety of the vehicle. The location is perfect. It's a quick walk to the beach or an easy drive to some of the restaurants in the area. With many hotels in the area of the same quality or less charging much more for parking and the resort fee - this was great value for the price. If you know you don't want to spend your entire day by the hotel pool this is a great option for lodging.

The hotel runs out of beach chair rentals which are included in said resort fee by 8am each morning.  We booked a silver room which was barely cleaned and the bathroom had random hairs and dirt in the tub. The tub also collected about 6 inches of water anytime the shower was used. The beds are incredibly uncomfortable with old coil mattresses and the sheets are so scratchy we wore long sleeve shirts and pants to bed. The remote for the AC unit was inoperable due to rusted batteries and the batteries in the safe fell out while it was locked and we had to call the front desk to unlock it for us.  The location is great and the staff are very friendly and moved us from our initial room that was right across from the elevators (the walls are paper thin and the dinging was nonstop) but unfortunately that doesn‚Äôt make up for the terrible quality that is the LaCroix hotel. We heard other occupants at all hours and felt very deceived by the pictures we saw online.

I asked Hailie if there was a bath tub because washing the babies in a shower would be difficult and she was so sweet and said I think so but if not let them know and she‚Äôd change it. She even followed up when I went down that night to grab utensils if the room had a bath tub or not. The rooms were spacious and so clean and we all slept so well, thank God. Mark was so friendly answering any questions that I had because honestly I tend to ask a lot of questions ha ha, and he also was kind to let us check out just a little later since we were getting around late with the kiddos. Karissa was so incredibly welcoming and I remembered her name because she was so sweet to change my reservation for me when I called and told her that my baby first birthday was this week. She even let me borrow an awesome float that was so nice to use and my son loved it. To top it off, the best part besides the unbelievable customer service was the infinity salt water pool.

Our initial room had a water leakage, and we thought about moving hotels. However, the staff was quick to find us another room so we could continue enjoying our stay.

Good location but parking was tricky and we were unaware of parking fees for their garage until we checked in.

783367029,50,Wonderful anniversary stay,The staff is absolutely amazing! The front desk answered all our questions and even upgraded our room and decorated it for our anniversary! Definitely went above and beyond. Parking is a bit of a headache due to the renovations. It‚Äôs a tight squeeze and hard to find. Personally don‚Äôt think it was worth the $35/night but it having a car did make our experience better on the island and other places do charge more.,Feb 2021,February 2021,Traveled as a couple,,
783348114,50,Jin is a gem!,"I arrived at Hotel LaCroix to celebrate my birthday on the 02/20/21 and prior to my arrival Jin kept in contact with me and even made some adjustments with my rescheduling and stay. The staff was amazing up til the maintenance, I can‚Äôt think of his name but he was very helpful in the request for my mirror placement. Thank you Hotel LaCroix staff for creating an inviting, warm atmosphere, if I could prolong my stay I would have-no doubt! Marissa was a sweetheart and would always acknowledge me when I would leave or come in. You are all appreciated and I loved my stay with you all.

783196153,50,Highly recommend!,"We were thrilled with the value we got for this hotel! Very nice and clean, perfect for our preferences! We wanted a nice, safe place to stay close to the action but without the price you pay for all the bells and whistles since we booked activities every day and knew we wouldn‚Äôt be taking advantage of any amenities at our hotel. We didn‚Äôt even need a place that serves breakfast because we knew we‚Äôd be trying the local restaurants every chance we got. Hotel LaCroix was ideal! (We switched from this hotel to a full-amenities resort for the last 2 nights of our stay but didn‚Äôt use them at all.) We also didn‚Äôt have to worry about any risk of Covid exposure from people being in our room because we opted not to have Housekeeping during our stay. As for customer service, you couldn‚Äôt ask for better!! Just text from wherever you are and let them know what you need and what time you‚Äôll be back. We highly recommend!",Feb 2021,February 2021,Traveled as a couple,,"Garland, Texas"

From Jin and Sophia at the front desk, who were always only a text message away, and sorted us out with anything we needed, to the housekeeping staff and room service folks: Lisa, Rene, Danny, Rodel and Nhila.

782940201,50,Exceeded my expectations,"Wow I‚Äôm so glad I stayed here! My boyfriend and I wanted to take a little staycation for Valentine‚Äôs Day, and not break the bank. We chose hotel La Croix and they really went above and beyond with their service. Even though the hotel is going through some renovations in small places (probably due to covid tourist drought), they went above and beyond to make our stay truly amazing! We simply asked for 2 champagne flutes to be brought to our room before check-in and we walked into the cutest set up with a huge heart shaped balloon, swan shaped towels, and a rose! It was very romantic and we were not expecting it. Sophia and Carissa were very attentive during our stay and answered any questions we had immediately. I will DEFS be coming back. Also their pool is sooo cute! Thanks for the great staycation :)",Feb 2021,February 2021,Traveled as a couple,,

782594785,50,Great hotel during unpecedented times,"My husband and I really enjoyed staying at La Croix. The location was pretty central, prices were very reasonable. Our room upon arrival was clean and had everything we needed. Unfortunately we noticed a day later, that our room was on the humid side. We decided to just deal with it since we are not the complaining type. However, Carissa sent us a text asking if there was anything she can do to enhance our stay. When I mentioned the humidity problem in our room, she informed us she would be able to change our room. We were so thankful for that gesture! Our new room was one of the newly renovated ones, on the 3rd floor. We were very happy with the new room. Plus, she continued to check in on us every few days during our stay! Excellent service. We would gladly stay here again!!",Feb 2021,February 2021,,,"New York City, New York"
782560022,50,Great where it matters,"We were very happy with our 4 night stay. My only gripe was the WiFi ...basically slower than dial up. If you‚Äôre a business person that requires connectivity, this may present a big problem. It was fine with us since we were on vacation and would rather be disconnected. Other than that the room had a nice view, the bed was quite comfortable, and everything was very clean which is super important to any guest. Front desk staff is welcoming, friendly, and genuine. Portraying this through a mask makes it that much more impressive. We stayed in room 1210 feb 4-8th. Woman who checked us in was great, sorry I forgot her name, Sophia and Philip also just exude great vibes. Thank you all!",Feb 2021,February 2021,,,
782461060,50,Family friendly hotel,"We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights with two small kids. Check in and check out were fast. I think it is awesome for what we paid for. I always feel welcome here. We were out for most of the day from 7 am to 6pm everyday. Before we left the hotel for our day trip, we borrowed beach towers and beach chairs and return them at the end of day. The hotel has cold/ice/hot water, tea and coffee, and microwave at lobby. Pool is kiddie pool. Parking lot is small and difficult to navigate if you have a big car (minivan) like us. We parked at King plaza next block for the rest two nights, it is cheaper and bigger but no in and out.  The location is perfect for us. We love walking through the park in front of the hotel. It is 10 mins walk to the beach. But it is a pleasant walk where you can find a lot of awesome trees/birds in the park. Or you can walk/drive your car to the lot next to Hilton Hawaiian Village (Ala Wai boat harbor) with 6 hour free parking and stay there for the beach (one man made lagoon and the other side is regular beach which has awesome sun set view). Another option is you walk/drive to Ala moana beach park, free parking and the beach is very calm, no wave, but it gets very crowded during weekends. A lot of food options within walking distance of the hotel. The hotel is also closed to Chinatown (10 mins drive) where you can buy fresh tropical fruits and asian foods.  All in all, we loved our stay at hotel Lacroix. We recommend it for budget travelers.",Feb 2021,February 2021,Traveled with family,,"Malden, Massachusetts"

And this is not only the front desk but every staff we cross path with. Because of the pandemic it is expected that we cannot get cleaning service everyday, however it is not a big issue. Staff are always ready to service my family with minor problems in the room whether it‚Äôs the shower, leakage, or needing of extra misc. things.    Parking is not hard but if you‚Äôre lucky then you‚Äôll find a spot. Also, if you get lucky you may find that the odor can be disturbing.    Over all our stay was very good!

781895732,30,"Ultimately, a 3 star hotel","Stayed here during the Honolulu leg of our recent Oahu/Maui vacay. On the plus side, it was fairly reasonable for Hawaii. On the downside, it should be, since it‚Äôs a pretty basic hotel that still dings you for the full ‚Äúresort fee‚Äù even though most of it‚Äôs facilities are closed. Sauna, closed. ‚ÄúFree breakfast‚Äù, nope. One of our balconies was closed for repair. Parking? $35 a day.    I knew it wasn‚Äôt on the beach, but I had imaginings that we might still go to sleep with the balcony door open and hear the distant surf. If you do this, what you‚Äôll hear is only the traffic and motorcycles all night from the main drag it‚Äôs on.    Pool was okay, although small. Location fairly convenient. A little less than 10 minutes walk to the beach. Staff was great and helpful. And as I said, it was inexpensive. But I wouldn‚Äôt rate it as highly as others appear to have. Ultimately it‚Äôs a three star and offers little more than a (semi-)cheap place to stay.",Jan 2021,January 2021,,,"Metro Minneapolis-Saint Paul, Minnesota"

At check in we were met with Carissa who was so friendly and got us checked in with ease, we had tons of questions and she answered them with so much knowledge and recommended a few sightseeing places for us to go to. Even though it was only for 4 nights it was a wonderful stay, when we checked out Carissa even offered to assist us with our luggage as there is a ramp so we appreciated that so much.

This type of ongoing communication made us feel looked after during our stay and provided a high level of convenience. The Room was spacious, modern, elevated, and luxurious. The bathroom was equipped with a jacuzzi tub setting that blew us away. I can't believe that I grew up here and never stayed at La Croix Waikiki until now, it's located at the beginning of Waikiki and coined the gathering place for good reason - everything was close enough, yet far enough providing a true oasis in Waikiki.

There was also a large bathroom + large tub and a small kitchen area for cooking. I always appreciate anything more than a microwave. :)    The bed was comfortable and had fresh clean sheets. I loved the wood feature wall and accents in the room.    Hotel LaCroix also has a gym room, swimming pool and sauna for the quests to use. Due to covid, the jacuzzi was closed.

780619140,50,5 Star Hotel with the Best Staff in Waikiki!,"I have traveled all of my adult life around the world and typically stay at 5 star resorts exclusively. Being in the hospitality industry means I have very high standards and I was blown away at Hotel La Croix. I've stayed everywhere in Waikiki including the Ritz and the Aston Beach Tower Residences and found myself most comfortable here at Hotel La Croix in one of their Terrace Rooms. Not only is the hotel beautifully and recently renovated, but the staff provides the best service I've experienced anywhere.    May in operations was gracious enough to tour the hotel with me and show me the different room types so that I could feel comfortable prior to booking a two week stay. Kaipo and Shaun are two of the friendliest 'fixers' around the hotel property and are willing to help with anything with a smile. Even Mhila in housekeeping who always says hello and checks in to see how you're doing. The staff make this hotel.    The hotel rooms are all different and each have their own charm, but little things like being able to stream netflix on the TVs, having a fridge in every room with a tea kettle down to the beautiful lanais with gorgeous views to enjoy the scenery. To the gorgeous pool and sauna. This hotel is my choice from now on when visiting Oahu.    Definitely more of a 5 star hotel especially when you factor in the gracious staff. Thank you team for a wonderful stay - I look forward to many more!",Jan 2021,January 2021,,,

We did have a few minor complaints at the beginning of our stay though, with Philp and the amazing maintenance manager Sean, both professionally made sure that we were comfortable and had the best first time in Hawaii! A few other employees that made our stay unforgettable were the outstanding front desk workers who greeted us with Aloha every time you exit, enter, or anytime you bump into them around your stay. Carissa, May, and Fernando all took care of our needs and made sure that we were all happy and that our first visit to Hawaii was one to die for.

779930560,50,5 STAR AMAZING!!,"The fact that we extended our stay to spend Christmas with them says it all - Hotel LaCroix in Waikiki is the best home away from home in Hawaii!    Amenities:  Completely dog friendly! We got a text from Philip from the front desk just saying hello to our puppy! Beach chairs, towels, boogie boards, great WiFi and the pool is awesome! The only co-ed sauna in Waikiki right next to the pool deck (make a reservation during COVID) and best part - KAUAI COFFEE twice a day... not just in the mornings.    Room:  We actually switched rooms but not because the first wasn‚Äôt great. Our first was Gold King with two balconies - super spacious and breathtaking views. We switched so we could cook - originally just wanted to move to a kitchenette but the only one available had two queen beds. When we expressed we were looking for a king bed, the staff helped us find a mini kitchenette on the penthouse floor, sold! Both rooms had bathrooms perfectly clean and the toiletries were great quality - the beds were super comfortable and I loved the fact they were feather pillows.    Location:  This is the first hotel in the Waikiki strip split with ocean and mountain views. It‚Äôs less than a 5 mile walk to (in my opinion) the cleanest beach in Waikiki. Longs which is a CVS is a couple blocks away. Don‚Äôt get stuck in the middle of Waikiki and swept up by the shopping of it all - the point is to experience Hawaii with all its beauty and Hotel LaCroix and all the staff provide everything for that.    I could go on and on but basically - BOOK HOTEL LACROIX! Any room and you will be in paradise. Parking is convenient at the hotel and again, all the staff were the best we‚Äôve experienced.

We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the accommodation as it was definitely on the high end of budget pricing for Honolulu (under $150/ night). We stayed in their smallest king room but it was clean, nicely decorated, and had a lanai that was pleasant to sit on, with a view of a downtown walkway. The location is very close to Luxury Row in the city, where you will find the uber-high end shops. Staff was excellent-- really warm, helpful, and welcoming; Philip at the front desk was especially great!  The only thing that was so-so about the room was that the bathtub had trouble draining when I took a shower; I took out the old-fashioned metal plug but could not get it to go in again. There were also some small wet spots with crumbs on our comforter, as if the cleaning staff were eating cookies or something while doing our room. No big deal, just noticeable.

Property is in the process of being refurbished with some areas yet to be done. Exterior does not do the hotel justice quite yet with evidence of an old ABC store and fish market still visible. I am certain that once business picks back up, those items are on the list. Underground parking is available and will test your parking skills. Bar/breakfast area is closed due to pandemic, which is understandable.    Our room was newly done and was small, yet very well done. Bathroom utilizes space very effectively and is well done. Could use an exhaust fan and a dimmer for the lights as they are bright. The window in the bathroom shines on the bed, so if someone is sleeping, they could be woken up by it. Bed was good and TV was oversized and new. Best part of the room was the lanai. It was huge and had direct views of the ocean which was awesome.    Service at the property was excellent. Nice, caring people from every area we interfaced with. From front desk associates (several) to the two guys which helped us with hot water adjustment and other minor asks were wonderful!

776771223,50,Stellar Service and Great Location,"After sifting through all the Waikiki Hotels and their resort fees we settled at Hotel LaCroix. Most of the beach front properties were 50-75% more expensive. Just don‚Äôt forget like all of Hawaii this hotel also has a resort fee of 33$ per night just like the rest. Any who, I checked the hotel on a map before I booked and you are a 3 min walk from the nearest beach and a 1 min walk from the start of the main drag of Waikiki (Designer Shopping, Restaurants,etc. More of a 9-11 min walk to get to the heart of the Waikiki Drag where Dukes Restaurant is and the main beach area. Very easy walk we did it about 6 times a day. It‚Äôs such a great walk on Kalakaua Ave all fancy stores to window shop, Dior, HERMES, Balenciaga all a half a block to the left of the hotel starting your walk to the main drag. The area around the hotel is deemed to be quite safe. We saw lots of friendly security guards at all times. You will find no shortage of food at all price ranges and cuisine styles in all directions from the hotel.    To the hotel -$22 UBER from HNL airport- a quick 15 min ride. Hotel does have daily parking with a fee for your car. The staff at the hotel were all marvelous. Each one went beyond the call of duty in friendliness and customer service. The restaurant inside the hotel is currently closed but they do offer great coffee in the lobby in the mornings and afternoons. There is a fitness center and a swimming pool at the hotel. If you are looking for a hotel to spend your days at the pool this is not the place. The swimming pool is worthy of a Facebook photo as it‚Äôs pretty but that‚Äôs about it. It‚Äôs extremely tiny more of quick little soak and that‚Äôs about it. There are a few chairs you also a small hot tub you make a reservation for to prevent more than 1 party inside at a time. The resort does provide you with a towel card for pool towels you can use for the beach! Which was great since it saved me some room in my luggage. Inside the room we had shampoo, conditioner, body wash and a hair dryer for in room toiletries. There is also a decent sized mini fridge in the room to store some drinks and small snacks. There are ABC stores Hawaii‚Äôs take on a convenience store at every turn. I won‚Äôt mention where they are as you will turn your neck in every direction and see them your entire trip. We went there to stalk up on some water and beach snacks.    Across the street is a very beautiful green park and right behind it is a super great beach. It‚Äôs perfect for a day at the beach or a quick sunset if you don‚Äôt want to trek the 10 min walk to Waikiki. It was far less crowded and in strange times like this we definitely preferred it over Waikiki.    We truly had a great time staying here. To save a few dollars in exchange for a 5-10 min walk to the heart of Waikiki is definitely worth it. There is no shortage of things to do we rented a private sail boat at Honolulu Sailing Company for 2 hours for $350 to watch the sunset. Truly unforgettable sunset and can bring all your drinks and snacks and that price includes up to 6 people. It was just myself and my husband and we enjoyed every minute. We rented a surfing lesson, Ubered $20 to Pearl Harbor, rented a car for the day and drove around the whole island (RECOMMENDED THIS MORE THAN ANYTHING!!!).

We are so fortunate that we got the coroner penthouse with a huge terrace, which I used for morning exercise and yoga while my daughter used for pretending play. The view from the terrace is amazing both during the day and the night that we saw a huge rainbow with a moon on the 2nd morning after little rain.    As we are locals, we wanted to stay away from Waikiki craziness so for those of you who want close proximity to what Waikiki has to offer, but not located directly in the center of Waikiki, this a perfect pot.

At night from parking had to walk around the whole building from parking garage to get in because they close down an elevator from there at night, making it very unsafe. 157 dollars plus a 100 deposit for their cheapest room.

766451179,50,Lovely Stay During a Pandemic,"Decided to stay in Waikiki during the pandemic. I was so glad I decided to pick this hotel. I booked a penthouse suite that overlooks the ghost town 17 floors before. As soon as I walked in, I was greeted with an warm ""Aloha!"" and was help immediately. Fernando checked me in and made me feel home despite the eerie feel of Waikiki. He made sure I was settled in and answered any questions I had with care and professionalism.  Immediately meeting him he brightened up the whole city.    The room was so cozy. Penthouse was 17 floors up and over looked Waikiki. I had both a city and ocean view which was lovely especially at night. The whole room was cleaned and at no time did I feel uneasy about Covid-19. The bed was cozy and there was plenty of space to enjoy the day with some quality ""me time""    At night I had the pleasure to meet Darwin who was just equality as caring as Fernando. I felt like I booked a 5 star resort. The whole staff was friendly and readily available for all my needs.    This is such a rare find these days for people who actually care about their guests, especially in times like these.

750751805,50,Wonderful!!!,"This was my second time staying at Hotel Lacroix. My first visit was with a friend and we had such great customer service I decided to come back with the family, and it was even better! We live on Kauai so we visit Honolulu a lot. Let me just tell you- the sense of ‚ÄòOhana at Hotel Lacroix is unmatched compared to any other hotel I‚Äôve stayed at. First, we had a slight snafu with our original room, and it was taken care of immediately and with flying colors. The sweet security gentleman even gave my kids a (big!!) bag of snacks. The parking gentleman (I forget his name, a tall man) is so nice, he gave us the best service! Make sure to tip this man! Everyone at the front desk was so friendly, helpful, and the best part, so personable. You really do get the sense of family here. They even serve a free hot breakfast buffet, which they call ‚Äúcontinental breakfast‚Äù, but it includes everything one could want: hot pancakes, scrambled eggs, fresh mixed greens salad, tons of fruit, cereal, hot oatmeal, tons of pastries, bagels and cream cheese, the works. They just don‚Äôt serve any breakfast meats but ummm, it‚Äôs free so that‚Äôs understandable! Even the buffet staff is so friendly. The pool is great, not huge but there‚Äôs room for adults, as well as two small pools on the side for younger kids to swim, and it‚Äôs a gorgeous setting with palm trees all around, beautiful at sunset especially! And there is a jacuzzi which isn‚Äôt very common at Waikiki hotels. Impeccable customer service all around. I highly recommend Hotel Lacroix, especially if you‚Äôre looking for a nice relaxing vacation. It‚Äôs not a huge resort type setting. Just a cute, clean, comfortable and enjoyable hotel.

749296636,40,Staff makes an effort,"Stayed for 3 nights in early March. Selected the hotel in part due to good reviews on Trip Advisor. Unfortunately we were underwhelmed . The staff here is great, friendly and really try hard to make you feel appreciated. The location is great with a short walk to the beach and lots of restaurants in the area. The use of pool/beach towels is a plus. Unfortunately it‚Äôs hard to hide that this is an old building. The bathroom was tiny and did not have vent fan. The tub was old with lots of caulking issues. They would be better off taking out the tubs and putting in showers ( more room ). The shower curtain fell down when we hung a towel on it to dry. The breakfast buffet was nothing special. Lots of fruit and pastries but the only protein was microwaved eggs. We went out on our second morning to enjoy a much better breakfast for just a little more money than the hotel wanted to charge. The happy hour is a nice touch but the drinks were cheaply made. We did enjoy having a balcony but it seemed every bus in town stopped on the street below us making it very noisy. Also our upstairs neighbors decided to move their lanai chairs around for an hour in the middle of the night, waking us up. Overall our stay was just ok. I would look elsewhere for our next Honolulu stay.",Mar 2020,March 2020,Traveled as a couple,,"Plymouth, Minnesota"
748925366,20,Way over-priced for a very mediocre hotel,"I have no idea how this place has such great reviews. The location and breakfast are good but the place is really run down. The toilet wouldn't stop running without jiggling it and the pool is tiny and not well kept. The jacuzzi was dirty and small. There is no view from anywhere and the pics are deceiving. There was only one tiny trash can in the entire room/bathroom. There was a party going on in the room above us at midnight the first night and we called the front desk but nothing was done. The beds are pretty comfortable and we got some rest thanks to earplugs. I travel a lot and this is a low 3 star or high 2.5 star hotel. Also, after all the fees were added in, I was charged $175/night by Cancelon. I was surprised to find out upon arrival that the hotel was charging me anything $86 for resort fees. Hidden fees are a real pet peeve of mine. I called Cancelon and they said it's in the fine print that this can happen and not their responsibility.

If it is nice out and you are late to the pool, the seats were always all taken. Our room faced the city, and apart from a very loud rooster in the mornings, was generally quiet.    It is a short walk to the beach and to the downtown area of Honolulu, and the staff are incredibly helpful with tips about where to explore.

746180165,40,Great location,"Stayed 4 nights. We were on the top floor with great views but only a small balcony. I think the property is undergoing renovations and hadn't got to the top floor yet. When the lift was stopping at other floors the hallways were white and bright. Top floor had lots of browns and was quite dark. I'm assuming the renovations hadn't got up there yet.  The room itself was 'interesting'. Lots of natural light and as previously mentioned great views but the d√©cor and the finishings in the bathroom etc. were a little off. Continental breakfast was served each morning downstairs. Scrambled eggs, pancakes, fruit, breads and pastries. The spread was quite good but the room it was served in might be mid renovation also and felt a little dirty. Floor was sticky and tables were mismatched. For me it bought the experience down a little. The pool was small but we never saw too many people in there.  The staff we encountered were all great. The location is close to the centre of Waikiki. Close enough to get there easily (8 minute walk) but far enough to not be right in the hustle and noise. A good hotel overall.",Feb 2020,February 2020,,,Vic

We always looked forward to the breakfast during our stay because they serve fresh fruit and salad everyday. Min/Tiffany was very friendly and welcoming during every breakfast service during our 9 day stay. Her positivity was infectious and she was always eager to help guests. Kudos to Min!

Location is good and there is a paid valet parking.  Our room was a corner one, spacious, had 2 balconies but bathroom was on the small side. The tap in tub was leaking the whole time and the fridge in the room was noisy also (especially at night time). After the first room service, room's floor did not seem very clean. It was fixed the next day though after we let reception know. There is washing machine and dryer in the hotel basement and reception has laundry powder for sale. Was quite handy instead of waiting at the laundromat.  Breakfast was included in the price and was really yummy and good.  Hotel also has snorkelling gear, chairs, beach towels etc. however make sure you check the gear before leaving the hotel. One of our snorkel was broken (seal was missing which stops water coming in) and the other one seemed ok but once we were in the water, water came in to the eyes. We had to rent the snorkelling gear at the beach.  We did not use the swimming pool so cannot comment on it.  Hotel staff was friendly.

Cost us about $1800 AUD for 4 nights for our family of 7. While cc‚Äôing wasn‚Äôt the cheapest we had buffet breakfast included so thought at the time it was a good deal. Check in was fairly easy but only 1 room was ready so we all piled into one room & dropped of our luggage. The rooms were bright & clean & we were located on the 14th floor. Lanai had a great view of the city & partial view of the beach so that was nice. The young gentleman who checked us in was pleasant but didn‚Äôt explain too much about the hotel amenities. There were a few other guest waiting for other requirements so think he just wanted to check us in & move on quickly. There were only 2 people at reservation check in & about 8 guest waiting.  There had been some power issue at the hotel so the 3 lifts were not operating very well. One lift was only working & it was terribly slow. They‚Äôre were signs around to notify the guest so that helped. The lift would stop on every floor which was somewhat annoying but by the end of our stay all 3 were functioning. I must say the housekeeping staff on Level 14 were fabulous. Jim was awesome & kept our room beautifully spotless. Little touches like my daughters blanket & soft toys were often presented out on the bed with flowers laid out on them. The beds were made immaculately & I would have to say the beds were the best we had in Hawaii & were the Most comfortable to sleep in. AC was cold & quite often we would have to turn it off as the room was cool most of the day without it on. Shower was great & bathroom clean.    There was a young lady on reception who‚Äôs customers service was outstanding. Young lady with short curly hair maybe of mixed heritage. I forget her name but she was fabulous & I commented to her that I would mention her. She was amazing & I do hope the manager will pass on my feedback.    The breakfast however I would probably have to mention was the worst I‚Äôve ever tasted in all my years of travelling. The seating was terrible & overcrowded, food was cold & tasteless & the staff were probably the rudest I‚Äôve ever seen. There was one particular lady who seemed to completely despise her job but thought it would be still polite to show her respect. I‚Äôm sure it couldn‚Äôt be easiest job & she seemed to be the only one working.    Location was towards the south end of KalƒÅkaua Ave.    Would I stay here again, maybe 1 or 2 nights but not any longer. Give the breakfast a miss too.

When we realized we needed a few extra days of cleaning and packing before relocating to Waikiki, we called the hotel, and the reservation staff graciously moved our check-in date forward and found us a room with no extra charge for the date change.    Upon check-in we found ourselves moved to the Penthouse level. Room 1703. At first, we were missing the corner king studio we had booked with a lanai, but there was a low window that opened in our room, and it did the trick to bring in fresh air. Upon waking, the view from the PH level is gorgeous, with the sun rising in the East and the ocean picking up the light on the West. As the sun rises it does get warm quickly in the bedroom, and especially the bathroom where there is a fan but no A/C.    We give special thanks for the guest services representative Jody. She was so kind and accommodating at check-in and took great care of us on our last night when we returned to the hotel, completely exhausted.

However, the next morning, was crazy. We waited for about an hour to get our car. We felt bad because there was only one employee to manage everything and we realized it was the same guy that was working at the bar the night before. So, for that price, we thought they had to hire a third-party, but no. We decided to park our car in a nearby parking garage for next days.

Au Contraire to other hotels, La Croix is one of the few that offered a second Queen size bed. From the moment we arrived until the last second spent in Oahu, I have nothing but glowing things to say about La Croix and their crew. Front desk, kitchen, Valet, room keeping staff, they are all top notch.  Hotel is clean, well kept, the rooms are spacious and comfortable. We stayed in one of the corner units with two lanai, one facing the water the other facing West. Awesome view.  Breakfast is to die for and included, and boogey boards, snorkeling equipment, beach towels are free to use if you decide to explore what the islands have to offer (plenty).  Front desk staff was very courteous and smiley; they will always tell you what was going on in town so you do not miss a thing.

Permission for 12 Noon checkout, yes. Good price, yes. Location at the entrance to Waikiki, yes. But waiting a couple of minutes for the only elevator in operation was frustrating. Then when the doors open, 12 occupants fill it, no room for me and my wife. Next time, you never know if the staff laundry cart will take the place of 5 passengers in a 10 passenger elevator. Couple times we decided to take the stairs, all the way from the 10th floor. Noticed other younger guests sometimes did the same. No indication that there is any urgency to get the other broken elevators fixed. Grrrr! Our room, although on a corner with two lanais, had only one slider that worked because of unrepaired concrete spalling on the edge of the lanai. It looked like more concrete would drop on the passersby below, hence no going out there for you. Ask for the Ocean View rooms, it's more costly but worth it, in my opinion. Beautiful views across the green belt that is Fort DeRussy at the entrance to Waikiki. Despite this busy street and intersection, the room was relatively quiet.

The hotel offered beach umbrellas, towels and snorkeling gear free of charge, as well as mini-fridge, coffee maker and microwave oven in the room. Personnel were all extremely friendly and helpful. There is an ABC Store in the ground floor, which I found very convenient. In spite of the busy location, our room was quiet. Room temperature was perfect and the AC was quiet.

731460672,50,Amazing Stay! Thank you Hotel La Croix!,"This is my 7th trip to Hawaii, but only the first at the Hotel La Croix. I wish I had discovered this gem of a hotel earlier. From the minute I checked in, Jody, Aude and the front desk staff made me feel so welcome. All the staff members make it their job to make sure you are having a great time. I know I will forget to mention all the great staffers that made this such a welcoming stay, but I have to mention Mhila, Rosalina and Catfina who left our room beautiful each day, the concierge/managers Miles and Darwin, team members, especially Keola, Manuelito. All you have to do is ask and you will get great advice for shopping, dinner, attractions, and anything else you might want to know about making a great VayKay. There is a fresh, hot breakfast every morning, happy hour several times a week (Fab Mai Tai‚Äôs by Miles!!!), the pool is small but a great place to chill out. My room was spacious and clean, with 2 small balconies with great views.I walked every morning to Waikiki Beach through the beautiful parks in front of the hotel. The grounds are well kept, safe and clean. Having laundry on site was great. The price is totally reasonable.

Rooms were spacious and nicely decorated, however bath and shower were old and difficult to adjust the bath/shower tap and poor drainage in the bath. Note the hotel does charge a daily amenity fee even if you book directly through their website. Make sure to book a high floor as the street noise is very loud on the lower floors.

The room was spacious and while it did not already have a lot of extras (coffee maker, refrigerator, etc.), we were told when we checked in that if it was not already in the room, just to let the front desk know and they'd send one to us. The breakfast was decent and the included happy hour on certain days was a nice touch. Our bartender even came by and brought over some Hawaiian chips.

729691072,30,Should be higher,"We stayed here for two nights, having spent a week in quiet Maui. It has a lot of great things about it, but the main con (noise) was a major issue for us.    Pros:  *price compared to other places  * if you book through their site, they waive the amenity fee (the fee is common at many hotels)  * you can check out towels, beach chairs, and snorkel equipment for free  * rooms are spacious  * views are fine (but no need to pay extra for a nice view as any view contains a busy road.  * free breakfast and the occasional happy hour  * super friendly staff who had helpful suggestions  * luggage storage post-check out    Cons:  * they keep their brochures for activities behind the desk so you can‚Äôt just peruse the options on your own. They should either have those out or have a compiled list of suggested activities if they want the payback by booking themselves  * no airport transportation  * noise. Now, I‚Äôm not a stranger to traffic noise - I live behind a highway. On our first night, our room had a busy road on two sides. Busses, trucks, and motorcycles zoomed by constantly. It shook the doors and the rumbling kept us up all night. It lessened at about 2am and started again at about 5am. Needless to say, it was not the relaxing or refreshing Hawaiian sleep we hoped for. Early the next morning, we asked if they had quieter rooms and they were kind enough to move us. The new room only had one busy road and it was quieter, but still quite noisy. I read other reviews about loud air conditioners and I kind of poo-pooed them, but the a/c‚Äôs were actually loud. It sounded like a bus idling right by our room. In the lobby, everyone had to talk loudly to hear each other and they played somewhat loud music. It was just a cacophony. In the rooms, some of the noise issue could be helped by replacing the aluminum sliding doors or adding exterior wall insulation if there isn‚Äôt some already.    So even though the rooms were great and the staff friendly, the noise issue ensures that I wouldn‚Äôt stay here again.",Nov 2019,November 2019,Traveled as a couple,,"Dallas, Texas"

728820077,30,No bargain,"Stayed 3 nights. Cater to Japanese (probably Japanese owned). Rooms are tiny (as I experienced in Tokyo) so room for a bed and a small table - that was it! No place for luggage or to even walk around the room. The TV was huge, much too big for the closet-sized room. It was a longer walk to Waikiki beach then I expected (20min minimum). The other huge drawback besides the tiny room was the $35/day for parking, which is robbery since the vehicles are parked by a hotel worker and they are crammed in to a small space, so usually another car had to be moved for the guy to get to my car.  public parking is on the same block for $24/day if you are not going in & out, but rather just parking it for the night.

There were small stains on the carpet, curtains, and ceiling. Paint was peeling and wood frames were warping and chipped. I saw a few insects crawling in the bathroom on occasion. The mattress was way past it's prime and droopy. The bathtub is kid-sized. No one over 5 feet tall could relax in that. The hotel pool is small as well.  I also found the check-in process to be sloppy and overall customer service to be poor. Simple, basic hotel requests were a challenge for the hotel staff to perform.  The continental breakfast provided was acceptable.

728225379,20,No idea why so highly rated...2 or 2.5 star hotel at best,"I wanted a nice but better value stay in Oahu. This site and others had off the chart reviews of this hotel so, I booked it. I was NOT impressed at all. The hotel is run down and has little to offer unless you are desperate and on an Extreme budget. Here were the misses:  --Room was not clean. Used coffee cups and pillows that looked like someone just slept there.  --Hardwood floors that were dirty  --Halls of each floor have floral smell of some sort and is not natural  --Popcorn ceiling with stains and tiny bathroom  --Pool is a total Joke. I've seen bigger blow up pools. I kid you not the pool is a few feet wide in a square shape  --TV in room had big stripe going down the middle. Dead pixels.  --Mattress is mega thin. Little more than a foam think with thin sheet and no spread.  --Breakfast area is barely that. Old walls/lights. Place feels Mega Dated!    I'll list a few positives too:  --Nice view from the corner room of city  --Can get beach towels/chairs for free  --""Miles"" was nice and friendly. Not his fault the hotel needs a total refurb.  --Didn't see any bugs    So, in conclusion I cannot recommend this hotel. It was nothing like the pictures and there are plenty of other places nearby. If budget is the main concern and you get this on a great deal, then, o.k. if you are just looking for a place to sleep. If your expectations are this hotel is a 3.5 star, you will be very unhappy.

Seems like it has been recently renovated, the room was bright and very clean. I did not get a chance to see the pool area as we were just there for one night.

727988191,40,Perfect for our needs,"On a recent trip to Hawaii to catch a cruise, we spent a night at the La Croix hotel on Kalakaua Avenue in Honolulu. I had picked it primarily for the lower price as compared to other hotels in the area with the thought that, ‚ÄúWe are only staying one night in order to be close to the cruise dock, how bad can it be?‚Äù We were pleasantly surprised at the overall quality of the hotel and the level of service provided.  We were afforded a complimentary happy hour in the dining area complete with appetizers beer and wine. They staff even continued to serve us for a while after the designated end time had passed.  There is an ABC convenience store just outside the lobby which has the standard array of sodas, snacks, souvenirs, t-shirts and macadamia nuts. The hotel is in close proximity to restaurants and there is a free shuttle that can get you to the mall, shopping district as well as Waikiki Beach that stops right outside the door.  After our checkout we had a few hours before we had to leave for our ship so Yan the helpful young lady at the reception desk took out luggage into storage for us to hold until we were ready to leave.

Our room was spotless and you could tell it had recently been revamped. We loved the pool area, there were smaller sections of it which meant you could usually get some privacy there and we loved having a dip in the jacuzzi each evening. The value you get for the resort fee was much better than other hotels in the area as the fitness center, breakfast and beach gear rental (snorkels etc) are all included.

I could easily find another hotel for less, but i continue to stay at Hotel La Croix because I know I will be given VIP service and respect, which more than makes up for any savings I could get from another Waikiki property. From the moment you check in you experience first hand from the front desk what I mean, from the outstanding level of service and genuine attitudes of people who just want your island experience to be the best possible, and are willing to help achieve it! People like Keola, who literally goes out of his way to make you feel special.

Disappointed on last day to find there wasn't a room we could use to shower as we had a late flight and being very hot and humid would have liked to freshen up.

Since my last visit, the hotel has definitely done a great job with renovations, especially at the pool. Although small, the pool is lovely. It has two smaller lounge pools on the side which is great to just chill. Our little one loved it because it was like his own little play area and he could stand on the seat/step inside. The whole pool deck is not complete yet but it looks great so far. The bathroom is clean and has a shower inside. I believe once it's done, they will have a bar and lounge so I'm excited to return when that's done.

720541302,40,Nice 3 star hotel close to Waikiki,"We've stayed here twice, both this year and last. Was Waikiki Gateway hotel last year. New owners now who renovated rooms. Reasonable price compared to the chain high rises. Close to everything. Or take city bus.  The Good: Staff is very nice, friendly, helpful people. They even mailed me back an article I had left in room (charged my credit card). AC works well. Queen beds are comfy. Nice breakfast that includes made to order omelets, fruit, sausage, rice, weird pancakes, scrambled eggs, coffee, juice. Safe for valuables in room.  Not so Good: Not a resort by any stretch of imagination, but they charge a resort fee daily just to use some beach towels. No choice. It just raises price of hotel by $25 per day. Also went up from $25 to $35 for valet parking. They used to give 2 free breakfasts with room but now only give 1. Charge $20 for extra person. Nice, smallish rooms but very skinny bathroom doors, not regular size. Bathrooms small, cramped. No exhaust fan. Towel hooks falling out of drywall from people hanging on, trying to get out of shower I guess. No drawers in room to put clothes. Had to remind maids to give toilet paper, Kleenex, & clean dry towels when serviced rooms. Towels do not have enough air to dry daily for re-use.  Bottom line: I would stay here again but add $25-35 per day to initial cost + valet if have car. Disappointed that new owners raised all prices for a maybe 3 star hotel.

When we did arrive it was 8am (much too early for check in which I totally expected) Lilly at the front counter took our bags and let me start the check in process, when we got back at about 2pm our room was ready. After arriving in our room Lilly phoned to make sure everything was ok and then proceeded to bring us up a welcome gift.

They were not only professional, but they truly connected with my family on a very personal level. My daughters (ages 4 and 7) cried when they got home when they realized that by the time we return to Oahu they may never see Darwin and Nikita again. They took very good care of our family during our stay.    The amenities of the Hotel were nice, but I was compelled to give this Hotel 5 stars because in the years I have travelled I have never come across such exceptional staff and exceptional human beings.

We know whats the standard and we are no picky people!!!    Let's start at the beginning. We booked a ""Corner Studio"" because of the beautiful images and the size of the room. At the first evening, we got a complete wrong room without a balcony. The lady at the counter ask us why thats a problem because that would be an even better room we have now with a kitch.... After a little discussion, we got our Corner Studio a day later. So we had to change the room the first time. When we moved into our Corner Studio we immediately recognized that the room gets promoted with the wrong pictures. The balcony that you see on the photos of the ""Corner Studio"" is actually the balcony of the penthouse but they just put it into the room of the ""Corner Studio""... So you are being cheated here!!! Keep your eyes open! The rooms look on the first view clean but in reality, they don't! We had black feed after 5 minutes in this room. When we whipped the floor with a towl it went complete black (see attached photos) (that happened in all 3 rooms we had, yes we had to change the room again!!!). The staff was 90% stressed and you always felt like you do something wrong when you just say hello. Just the guy who helped us with our bags was super nice! The cleaning staff told us every time we saw them that we should make a good rating on TripAdvisor with their name in it. 3 days before we had to leave we had to change our room the second time because of some construction... So we had 3 rooms in total! All in all, it was one of our worst experiences in a hotel this price range.

Valet was easy to find (on Kuhio) and check in was quick and easy. They helped us bring all our bags up to our room and were extremely friendly.    I‚Äôm bad at remembering names, but everyone we made contact with definitely had the Aloha spirit you expect when visiting Hawaii, or in my case, escaping from the busy work week and life of living in Hawaii.    If I could give more stars or a higher rating, I would! The room was breathtaking. We had a wrap around lanai with a huge open view of the ocean and a lot of room to lay around and be outside to enjoy the warm rays and cool breeze. The hotel and room were very clean. Don‚Äôt let the outside fool you. Like people say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt judge a book by its cover‚Äù this hotel has gone over major renovation and it really shows. The vibe of the room is a little old school/vintage (the fridge) meets Hawaii modern.    The pool, although it‚Äôs a little smaller, it was definitely a nice view and a nice little place to hang out.    All in all, this hotel is awesome! I can‚Äôt wait to see what else they have in store for the hotel. Maybe a restaurant or bar in the lobby will set it up to the next level (?) we shall see what else comes of the hotel.",Sep 2019,September 2019,Traveled as a couple,,"Honolulu, Hawaii"
712432474,40,Great Value for Honolulu,"For a three star hotel, this little gem is very good value. We did have some issues when checking in. Our room was not ready as it was morning, but repeated promises that it was an hour wait..then .a two hour wait...then ten minutes..then a few more minutes then a few more hours meant that it was 2.45 pm before we checked. The room we had booked was being used by someone else but we could have it three days later. We opted for a room without a sea view as we were extremely tired. The room was bright and clean with a large balcony , fridge that worked well, very comfortable beds and lots of soft pillows. We were apologised to and given a bag of goodies for the mix up so all in all, we were happy for the week we stayed. Breakfast was ok but a bit chaotic at times but we never expect good breakfasts anyway. The small pool was never busy and was a nice place to relax. In spite of our initial disappointment we would recommend the La Croix.

We were very pleased with our 11th floor room that had a balcony facing the ocean and a second balcony providing a city view. The room was large, had everything we needed and the king size bed was extremely comfortable. The staff was superb: Aude, NIcki at the front desk, Thomas at the complimentary happy hour, and Katerina who cleaned our room all went above and beyond to make our stay one of the best vacations we have ever taken!! The location is perfect with a bus stop literally outside the door and the beach a short walk across a park area. Our rate included free hot breakfast which we thoroughly enjoyed; the food was delicious with lots of options that varied from day to day. There is an ABC store right in the hotel that was super convenient. The pool was recently renovated and there were beach chairs and umbrellas available to take to the beach. We highly recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a thoroughly enjoyable, economical Honolulu experience!!!",Sep 2019,August 2019,,,
710761731,40,"Great price, location, service, and rooms","Really enjoyed our stay here at Hotel La Croix. Price is very reasonable, rooms were clean and comfortable. Staff was EXCELLENT: so nice and accommodating for everything we needed. There were some unruly guests on our floor (hey, it's Waikiki, things gets wild and that‚Äôs not the hotel‚Äôs fault) and security was very responsive to our call. Great kamaaina (half off parking, great room rate, and free breakfast). Location is perfect, far away from noise but close enough to drug store, restaurants, and shopping. We didn't use these but they had a lot of amenities like boogie boards, beach chairs, umbrellas, etc. Pool is modern but small but good for lounging and the restroom was so nice. When they have everything all completed on the pool deck (still a little construction happening while pool was open), it'll be really nice.    My one complaint was the breakfast and dining area was fine but not sure if I'd pay for it. Glad it was included in the price. The restaurant is hot and very strangely designed in terms of space and flow. Also not sure if the omelette bar is up to code in terms of how they store and prepare the food. Things looked quite unorganized there e.g. bag of bacon bits in the sink. The food was ok (2.5/3 stars) but nothing extraordinary. The hotel can really increase their revenue with some modern touches to the dining area as well as offering some fresher buffet items and maybe even having an all day restaurant with room service. We did Uber eats a lot since we stayed in due to recovering from medical procedure in Honolulu. Again, grateful to have a convenient and hot breakfast but can definitely be improved. But who stays at a hotel for the breakfast anyway? Lol    Bottom line: Don't hesitate to stay here, you won't regret it.",Sep 2019,September 2019,,,
710370928,30,"Ok hotel, but definitely NOT worth paying extra surcharges","(Formally known as Gateway) Stayed here for a week over September. Here are the good bits.    - Location is good. Nearby to downtown Waikiki strip and also beach (about 10 minutes walk)  - Rooms are clean, tidy, recently updated and refurbished.  - Service ok.  - Room service good (although one of the days they didn't bother to make up our room - change sheets, tidy room etc)  - Good array of breakfast items    Here are the not so good bits.    - Reception don't seem to care much. She asked me for what occasion had I come to Hawaii, I mentioned my 10 year wedding anniversary and the renewing of our vows. This was met with indifference. You would normally expect a congratulations at very least. Some hotels do even upgrade you.    - Arrived feeling jet lagged and exhausted after the 9 hour flights from Sydney. Paid for the early check in but upon arrival, receptions advised room wouldn't be available for another 3-4 hours. This was a really disappointing start to my stay.    - Paid the additional fee/cost of the water sports - e.g. surfboard, snorkel gear etc - found out it wasn't in the room as I thought, you had to front up to reception and it was first come first served (so there was a limited number of items available) never ended up evening using it. It's absolutely not worth paying extra for    - Better security. Lifts could do with security swipe or pass. Anyone can come in off the street and go up to rooms, This didn't leave me feeling particularly safe.    - You can hear the rooms nearby and can get noisy! - There were a couple in the room above us arguing and fighting on one of the nights,    - Happy hour empty and very few choice of drinks (I think only 2 or 3)    Overall ok stay, but some things definitely ruined it.",Sep 2019,September 2019,,,"Brisbane, Australia"

My husband was sooo surprised. Absolutely loved it.  As a hotel professional myself I do want to mention that we were thinking about extending a few more nights however had to change our minds because rate matching was not honored and we were asked to pay $100 more per night then what we would've been able to book it online for. The ladies and gents were a bit short, I get that we had an upgraded room, wouldn't have needed to stay in the same room type and change rooms, however no solution or none of that was offered.

Day or night the rest of the staff seem to hate their job and it shows. I left for Maui and inquired about obtaining my same room again. The front desk staff member quoted me over $946. I said clearly you have something wrong. I just paid half that for the same exact room. She said nope thats the price. I informed her I cannot believe she was sending me to the internet to book the room cheaper... which I did. The extra fees here are ridiculous too. What amenity do you offer that I should be the fee? I didn't use a thing except towel service and had to wait 20 minutes each time to get or return them while the staff checks in our out guests. I upgraded to the penthouse which was no upgrade. It does not even have a balcony and the balcony below the room protrudes out 10 ft passed the PH! The noise below carries right through the windows and they can look right up into your room! The breakfast is blah and even with 1 free breakfast it still costs $25 for the 2nd breakfast...its breakfast with nothing special. We passed most days. The location to the beach was very acceptable.

Our cleaning lady was so sweet, I wish I new her name to add to this review. I can honestly say that the customer service from everyone made our experience at the hotel great! So convenient to have coffee, tea and water always readily available in the hall during the day. Only negative thing I can say, was that the rooms can be noisy from the traffic below. Kinda depends where you are located. We changed our room and it was better. Really appreciate the great customer service! Mahalo",Aug 2019,August 2019,Traveled with family,,

700143706,50,"location, location, location!","Location: The hotel sits at the end of luxury row, easy to access all of the Waikiki shopping/restaurants/beach. Very reasonably priced for the surrounding hotels in the area. If you want the proximity of Waikiki but don't want to pay for a Hilton or Sheraton, this is a great choice. On the downside it is right next to Kalakaua Ave, which is quite a busy street, and a couple of times during our 10-day stay I woke up from ambulance sirens. All parking is by valet, pretty normal for the area and there's an additional charge for it.    Breakfast: was included with our hotel deal, and I was expecting a modest continental-type set up of a few sugary pastries and tired-looking fruit. I was pleasantly surprised to discover quite the opposite: a buffet of cook-to-order eggs/omelettes, waffles, pancakes, 2-3 daily rotating breakfast meats and potatoes, breads, bagels, muffins, oatmeal, fruit, cold cereal, coffee, juice plus a daily small salad bar. Most mornings included steamed rice and miso soup options as well. The breakfast area was large enough to find a seat no matter what time in the morning you went. (6:30-9:30am)    Staff: front desk always polite and professional, housekeeping staff eager to please, our housekeeper gave us her card and hours, which was nice for planning purposes. The maintenance staff really excelled in my opinion, some of the friendliest and most prompt service I've ever encountered in a hotel setting. We needed to call them twice for a couple of room issues, and literally within minutes they were knocking at the door. They were on our floor doing touch up painting most of the time during our stay, and went out of their way to hold elevators for us and give us a smile and hello.    Room: If staying in a plush, brand-new room is your thing, then it might be better to continue looking down the street. The room itself (while obviously updated) has signs of being a slightly older hotel.There were popcorn ceilings and the bathroom had a slight mildew smell after a few days. Beds were plenty comfortable though, never had an issue there, and the pillows had varying degrees of fluffiness for your desired preference.    Gym: Gym facilities are important to me in a choosing a hotel, and this one was rather small and disappointing-2 treadmills, 2 elipticals, 1 bike and small free weights area with 1 bench and abd machine. However we were so active with activities it wasn't too big of a deal.    Overall: good price, great breakfast, great location, comfortable beds. Would 100% stay again",Aug 2019,August 2019,,,

699009292,50,Clean and well located,"Booked 3 nights at La Croix, a few nights at the Sheraton Waikiki and then traveled to the North Shore just to get a little variety. Initially assigned a 4th floor street facing room. Construction was happening in the hallway. Between the street noise and construction, it was too loud to stay. Asked to get a new room. Ended up on the 12th floor. The glass sliders were not dual paned so short of changing hotels there was no way to get away from the street noise. Despite this I give this hotel 5 stars because the staff was accommodating, the rooms were clean, the beds comfortable, the hotel is centrally llocated just off the main drag, and super affordable. The hotel will let you check out boogie boards, towels and chairs for the beach :)). Even though parking is valet only, I found it super convenient to valet - never a long line or wait. We managed to get plenty of rest and thought the stay at La Croix was more comfortable than the Sheraton Waikiki. Our 3 nights stay equaled the cost of 1 night at the Sheraton! Really can‚Äôt beat that. Besides the Sheraton felt stuffy and inconvenient, the beds too soft (did a number on my back) and the grounds/beach only so so - way too touristy. We plan to go back to La Croix next year.",Aug 2019,August 2019,Traveled with family,,"Seattle, Washington"

She checked on us to make sure we have everything we needed and made sure our toiletries were stocked and fresh towels was replenished daily. An added extra touch in our room was the cookies, bunny towel and flowers on our bed that Mhila left for us daily. We did not use the pool or try breakfast as we would walk to the beach in the morning and grabbed breakfast on the way. They run out of beach towels on our 2nd day & it was only 8:15am.

My wife and I decided to take a quick vacation inside America, I want her to experience a salt-air place along with a fascinating view of the fine line between the sea and the seashore, we chose Hawaii. As we went on the trip, of course we also had to budget our money and we found Hotel La Croix which is perfect - staff were definitely hospitable and very accommodating when it comes to handling guests. I remembered Mhila, one of the room attendant who helped us discover places we could go to and we could never discover the pool if she did not offer it to us.

Needs improvement: The rooms were fairly clean and bright, but you can tell some need a little TLC. The tub in our room wouldn't drain and we had some issues with it leaking. The batteries were dead in the fan and TV remote and this took a bit longer than expected to have rectified. The kitchenette in our room was really small/dumpy and not really worth the extra price. Valet parking is not ideal as you don't have access to your vehicle and sometimes have to wait awhile for it to be retrieved (most hotels in Oahu have valet parking as the only option).

I understand there may be an issue having an umbrella on the balcony but when I asked I was told that they were not at the pool because someone had complained previously but I think it was an oversight to remove them it makes it quite uncomfortable to be at the pool in the hottest hours of the day and sit on the pool chairs for any extended period of time. If there was an issue with the cushions perhaps the chairs could be replaced by the ones on the balconys. Overall we throughly enjoyed our stay here and I would recommend to my friends and family. Good location, good views, accommodating and helpful staff, good rooms and nice pool. Thank you for making our time there so nice!",Jun 2019,June 2019,Traveled as a couple,penthouse terraces worth the extra money,"Fort Collins, Colorado"
682236092,50,WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND,"After an extensive search on Trip Advisor, we decided on staying at Hotel La Croix for our trip to Honolulu because it was economical and had a lot of positive reviews. We would totally recommend this lovely little boutique hotel located at the end of Waikiki. We booked directly through the hotel's website, and our hotel stay included a bull breakfast buffet for 2 every morning and two refreshing cocktails at the hotel bar for 2 every evening. The renovated pool opened just as we arrived and, although small, it was very lovely and refreshing. Our rooms were clean and comfortable, had a fridge (which was important because my husband is diabetic and has to have his insulin kept refrigerated) and a small balcony. The entire hotel staff (including front desk, room service, bartenders, baggage handlers, etc.) were very kind and helpful. It was a much more personal, friendly and intimate environment as opposed to a large boisterous hotel. It was a short 10-minute walk to Waikiki beach and to many shopping and eating establishments. Also, there was a trolley stop directly in front of the hotel and bus stop locations very near, and we saved a lot of money using the trolley and bus to get around the island.",Jun 2019,June 2019,Traveled as a couple,,"Pearland, Texas"

We received an upgrade to the penthouse level which was a corner room with an amazing balcony! We also enjoyed the breakfast with many selections. There was an awesome coconut syrup that paired well with my waffles topped with macadamia nuts, coconut flakes, chocolate chips and whipped cream.

The view of Waikiki from the room is breath taking, and the most incredible thing to wake up to! I also cannot forget about the delicious breakfast the hotel offers. I cannot wait to see what the hotel will look like when all the renovations are complete! I will definitely be back!

679612638,50,Good location and excellent value,"I chose Lacroix because it was reasonably priced and in a convenient location. I was not disappointed.    The building itself is showing its age. While the hotel has been given a spruce-up, it's certainly not fancy. But nothing to complain about with the room itself or the amenities.    My room rate included free buffet breakfast, which was a good start to the day. A good selection of American, European and Asian breakfast favourites - and pineapple.    The hotel is a short walk to Waikiki beach and a slightly longer walk to the central Waikiki shopping district. It's a slightly longer walk to Ala Moana mall - but I found it too hot to do this. Fortunately, the hotel is very close to major bus routes, so it's a good place to be based if you haven't got a car.    There's a small but well-stocked ABC convenience store in the hotel lobby, which is very useful for picking up things like sunscreen, snacks, beverages, sandwiches, etc.    The only downside: the balcony doors are single glazed and aren't the best at keeping out traffic noise. The park side of the hotel faces two main roads, which seem to attract exuberant motorists on weekends. I sleep with earplugs so it wasn't really a problem, but it might be an issue for light sleepers.    All up, Hotel Lacroix is in a good location and represents good value for those looking for basic hotel accommodation in Waikiki.

The hotel has been recently re-painted on many levels and as ours had it was nicely refreshed. The staff are a compliment to the management of the hotel in being professional as well as friendly to the guests at the hotel.

674633595,40,Staff & Extras,"Here's a case in which an ordinary building, a high-rise concrete hotel with small mediocre rooms, is made extraordinarily good because of the staff members and the extras. As a result, we would stay here in future, since, for Waikiki, this place is good value.    Very friendly, helpful staff people make this a welcome atmosphere. Thank you to Olivia, Aude and especially Russell during our 6 days.    Extras include free drinks at the bar from 12-5, a fairly decent buffet breakfast, and beach amenities.    If you are looking for a place that's fancy with wonderfully appointed rooms, try another accommodation. If you want something quiet, try the other end of Waikiki near Diamond Head.

Easy to get buses. We stayed only 1 night in the ocean view penthouse, which was fully renovated and had a lovely beach style decor, very comfortable king bed, quality linens and toiletries etc. terrace was huge, sea views amazing and very quiet. On return from our cruise we stayed at the very dreadful Hilton Hawaiian Village at twice the cost, we wish we had returned to the La Croix! The breakfast buffet, which negates the resort fee (only $20) is superb, choice is excellent and was not crowded and no wait.

Breakfast buffet is pretty good, nice variety and an omelet station which I used every day as I hate the frozen eggs hotels put together. PS even if you aren‚Äôt taking their breakfast there are coffee machines and water jugs outside  The best part of the hotel-great staff who make sure they take care of anything you need, from front desk staff to maintenance to breakfast staff and valet guys. Special mention to Russell.  They also have happy hour drinks specials everyday.  While we were there the pool was under repairs which was a bummer but the staff definitely covered that by providing additional perks.  One thing they could improve on is that the property is slightly dated so repairs and Reno‚Äôs should be on the agenda, looking at the pool I would say they are working on it.

We loved the location (walking distance to Waikiki Beach, restaurants, shopping, Fort DeRussy Park and Beach, the Army museum and public transportation. The buffet breakfast, which was included in the price of our stay, was delicious. Aude, at the front desk, was so helpful! We asked her many questions throughout our stay and she was always informative with a smile on her face. The other hotel employees were also friendly and helpful, but we don't know all of their names...Miles was one of them, though. After we cheking out, we wanted to do some more sightseeing before boarding the ship, so we were able to leave our luggage at the hotel--safe and sound until we returned five hours later!

671974876,40,The best staff in town!,"The staff at this hotel were simply awesome. We were greeted upon check in by Alissa who made us feel very welcome and was kind enough to check us in early as we had arrived at 8am. This was very much appreciated as we had travelled all night for up to 12 hours to get to Hawaii. The staff during the rest of our stay were equally awesome. A special shoutout to Miles, Kiola, Hee from the cafe, and to Jody. They all made our stay very comfortable.    Facilities wise this hotel isn't the best, but the comfort of the room and the staff made up for it. I also thought the $20 resort tax was nothing but a superflous tax. You do get $20 credited back if you have breakfast but out of our 8 days we only had breakfast 2 or 3 times as it gets super busy and the restaurant staff, as lovely as they are, struggle to cope with the traffic and volume. As a result omelettes take up to 25 minutes. The swimming pool during our stay was also closed.    Location wise, it is great. A couple of minutes walk to downtown Waikiki, and also 10 minutes walk to the beach.    They do free drinks for hotel staff everyday, but the opening times of this service are unreliable and inconsistent. It's good if you are lucky to make it, but as I said some days they did not even open the bar. When we did make it however, Miles kept us entertained and whipped up great cocktails.

669993268,50,Very nice stay,"I stayed at Hotel La Croix for 6 nights and had a great stay. The room was large. I stayed in an ocean view room. I loved having 2 lanais. One faced right out to the ocean, the other was on the side of the room. Not as nice of a view, but was great to hide from the mid afternoon sun. The room was large and clean. The bed was comfortable. There were plenty of towels, lots of hot water in the shower and good water pressure. The breakfast was also good. Lots of different choices and well stocked. All the staff I encountered at the hotel were very friendly and helpful. The mid afternoon drinks were a nice added bonus. The pool was unfortunately closed for renovations, but they did make this clear when I was booking the room, so it wasn't a surprise to me. The location of the hotel was great, with quick walking access to the beaches, shops and restaurants, and it was easy to catch transit with many stops near by. Some right out the front of the hotel, other routes only a block or two away. There is a small ABC store on the main floor, and a whole bunch of larger ABC stores near by.

669903980,40,A ‚ÄúGem‚Äù in a concrete jungle! Loved itüëçüëç,"I bkd using online site (booking.com)well in advance to secure one of the few penthouse terrace rms! Perfectly matched the description given on web- always a plus. You want to pay for what you chose in advance so no disappointment on arrival.  We messaged resort a few times prior to our arrival with some questions and requests. All promptly responded to and answered efficiently and with extra info to assist on our late night arrival, such as transfer info, restaurant recommendations, daily activities provided and in area. This is so helpful when you have not been to a destination- feels like someone else is as invested in your stay as you are.  As we were also celebrating our milestone anniversary along with a milestone birthday, the staff arranged a lovely welcome with local flower petals and pretty towel display on bed- after a long flight it‚Äôs so nice to have such a lovely greeting and acknowledgement.    We booked a Penthouse terrace with oversized which had an amazing oversized L-shape balcony overlooking parkland, with a beautiful ocean view. Part of balcony semi obstructed but non issue. We could easily see the stunning views afforded to this top floor room option. Our outdoor terrace/balcony provided 2 loungers along with locally inspired deck chair. The balcony is partially clad by artificial grass around edges to add a backyard feeling which we loved. Inside the room had soft, beach decor with huge flatscreen smart TV, queen size bed which was very comfortable.  This is pet peeve of mine‚ÄîA great night sleep must be as high on the hotel‚Äôs list of standards as it is for the guests. It can make a great hotel review turn sour if not. Loved the in rm Keurig coffee maker, coffee pod options with local flavours(yum- love my coffee) along with mini fridge that had both fridge and freezer sections. Great for you store snack, drinks ,baby food exec or the wine we brought for sipping on balcony during our stay! Wine glasses available- just ask the extremely professional and courteous staff at front desk and they will assist in anyway they can to help provide these little extras to make your stay as enjoyable as possible.    Drawin checked us in and was extremely helpful and quick to advise hotel info, like breakfast (our included) times and options, gym, on site convenience store, atm, beach chair provisions, distance to attractions and sites etc. No questions were too tedious or repetitive for him. Darwin was efficient and his kind demeanour and courteous attitude prevailed over our constant interruptions to his knowledgeable dialogue. A true gift of patience and a warm welcome for sure!    This is an older resort going through final phase of refurbishment and the attention to detail did not go ‚Äúun-missed‚Äù by us. Beautiful and fresh. The pool was on last days of overhaul and opens early May. The rooms have been renovated and refreshed and bathrooms, although still looking dated were spotless and well equipped with local toiletries/amenities provided. 3 elevators ( another plus) for 16 floors is great too.  Just a note to guess‚Äî luggage and wheelchair ramp provided into hotel and I assume handicap accessible rooms are available. Message in advance of booking and they will advise best rm option to accommodate your travel needs prior to your arrival. I travel with my 83 yr young parent at times and accessibility and comfort for these type of guests definitely require the attention to detail that must be met during their hotel stay.    Location is ‚Äúkey‚Äù here as hotel , although in quiet area is literally about 2-3 short blocks walking distance to the core of Waikiki tourist area. T Galleries with high end stores along with local shops provide all style of ware for the ‚Äúvacation shoppers ‚Äú and restaurants everywhere. Right out front hotel you can take one of the 4 main trolley options if you purchase tickets taking you to all points of interest from iconic Pearl Harbour, China town and historic Hawaiian Palace and Veterans Cemetery ( must see spots) onto Waikiki beach area then onwards to and up past Diamond head into Sandy Beach area - a 2 day all line s pass is $45.00 USD pp and worth it. Lower priced options available too or single use tickets.    Buffet breakfast self service and loads of options catering to many types of guests needs and dietary requirements. Lounge area also provides complimentary coffee and teas all day.  As of December the lounge offers complimentary alcoholic/ non alcoholic drinks from 12-5 Mon-Fri and 12-7 Sat and Sun! Wow- you don‚Äôt get that type of extra service amenities in most hotels anywhere!!  Non smoking rooms was a huge part of our choice of hotel, and when an issue of our room neighbours that opted ( maybe they forgot) to smoke on their balcony were quickly ( with a front desk call from me) and very politely asked to cease immediately. They were also advised a fee would be charged for smoking. I appreciate this attention to detail as many guests have this a a non negotiable standard in hotel choice. Non smoking and great wifi are top 5 ‚Äú must have‚Äùs‚Äù for me and my clients too. I don‚Äôt want to smell like smoke because of someone else‚Äôs neglect to the rule Just say...    This has become a top contender for myself and my clients when choosing a altogether fantastic hotel in the Waikiki/Honolulu area for sure.  Aloha and Mahalo to the amazing staff at La Croix.

However it is a clean hotel and for a couple of nights was fine for our stop over.  The hotel is a nice quick and convenient walk to the beach. There are lots of little shops very close by.  Breakfast was included in the rate. The restaurant was very chaotic and we didn't get the omelets that we ordered. They let too many people in at a time and many folks were left standing in the middle of the restaurant waiting for a table to become available - very awkward. To be honest, the food was not very good.If I had paid for breakfast I would have been quite perturbed.  So for a quick cheap stopover the hotel is ok.

665385206,30,Looked better in the picture,"The lobby was kept clean and the dining area was nice.... and that's where it stops. My bathroom was not clean at all, there were so many hairs in the tub, on the bathroom counter- I should have changed rooms then! Sunday I wake up and notice two bite marks right across my wrists and my ankles were very itchy. I googled what it could be because it did not have noticeable puncture marks.... turns out to be bedbugs. I called them immediately and was able to change rooms- and to my amazement, the new room's bathroom is just as debatable as my last. I asked for three blankets, just so I could lay on top of the blankets and pray to not be bitten again.    I contact the front desk asking for a manager and was connected with a Olvia. When they transferred my room they said they would have Pest Control come the next day and confirm if it was bed bugs. I literally had to beg them to provide me ointment or reimb for my itching and swelling. I practically had to slightly raise my voice, before one of the staff members gave me $20 in a change to wash all my clothes (had to ask for that too;then i had to ask for soap as if she thought i was going to use air) When changing rooms, they provided me with trash bags to put my clothes in, but the laundry room was already closed for the night)    Without providing all examples of their poor service. I will leave it like this. You can get bed bugs at any 5-star hotel. My issue is the poor service and the way they handled the situation that wasted 2 days of my business trip limping due to the pain and unable to enjoy any activities I had planned. After multiple phone calls to see if the report showed bed bugs, they say it did not but the report only showed that he was in the room for 7 mins (not sure if i should be impressed or if this was shady) I contacted Orkin myself and they explained it would take a minimum of 30 mins to clean the room and stated they would have someone come back out. I notified Olvia that they were coming back, and THAT is when she proceeded to tell me something was wrong with the tech's tablet and could not record the time (then why did'nt you say that when you gave me the report??!! aka SHADY). Then an Anne tries to call me stating she is from accounts and is off-site (not sure the purpose of this call or her position), but loved how she randomly appeared onsite to hand me the final inspection form. At the end of the day, I could not wait to leave the next day. In my previous counter conversations with Olivia, and me stating I was going to the doctor she asked if the doctor confirmed if it was bed bugs (are you now wanting to confess your lies??!!). I guess I was lucky enough to not have as many bites as the other feb post    The food was average but it least it was there. I will NEVER return to a hotel that does not respect me as a customer or my business.",Apr 2019,February 2019,Traveled on business,,
664772175,50,Great Place to Stay at Waikiki,"We were looking for a place to stay for 3 days in Waikiki before our NCL Cruise and we stumbled on this gem using TripAdvisor. Because of the low price, I was apprehensive, but once we checked in, we were so glad we booked it. Hotel La Croix was one of the nicest, friendliest and convenient hotels we have stayed at. The hotel used to be the Waikiki Gateway Hotel and the new owners have spared no expense in refurbishing and upgrading the rooms and lobby. The rooms were clean, neat and quiet. The entire staff seemed to be working extra hard to make your stay enjoyable.    It was just a short (5 min.) walk across a beautiful park to Waikiki Beach. The Hotel had beach chairs, surf boards, boogie boards and snorkel gear available free to the guests. Each morning there was a cooked-to-order breakfast buffet available and each evening they had a happy hour in the breakfast room. There was a convenient ABC Store (look them up) just off the lobby to purchase beverages, snacks, souvenirs, clothing, etc.  I would highly recommend Hotel La Croix.

649359515,50,Hidden Gem in Honolulu,"When we travel we often look for smaller boutique hotels as they often surpass the big chains and we were delighted with our 7 night stay at Hotel La Croix. The hotel is older but it is obvious it has been updated including large flatscreen televisions and wood flooring in the rooms except right next to the beds. A couple of suggestions about the rooms would be a dresser as we prefer to not live out of our suitcases and while the repurposed entertainment unit was great for table top space there wasn't space to unpack and a towel bar would allow for towels to be reused, the hooks did not allow them to dry properly and a ring for the hand towel would be nice give the small vanity. These things are minor though and did not detract from our stay. Let me be honest in saying that this is a busy area of Honolulu which makes it easy to get around, but that also means there is a lot of traffic and thusly traffic noise including sirens which was pretty much an everyday occurrence, however you will find this in any hotel in the downtown area. Pluses to this hotel we had a lightbulb out which was replaced when we asked. Because it is an older hotel, there are not many plugs so my husband moved out the credenza and plugged in a small 3 plug power strip so we could keep our electronics charged, we came in the next day and housekeeping or maintenance had put in one in its spot with 6 plugs and 3 USB chargers which was very attentive to our needs without us asking. Housekeeping by the way was awesome. The hotel has a breakfast buffet daily, normal cost is $16.50 a person but with the amenities fee you get a $20 credit towards breakfast so it was like $12 a day for the two of us. A wide variety of foods were offered daily and it changed a bit from day to day so you didn't get tired if the same old things each day. While the fried rice was a bit different for a breakfast offering, it soon became our favorite. Where this hotel really shines is in the staff, the front desk staff was amazing and each day as we got our towels from them and ordered our chairs and umbrella they were happy to assist. Roland the morning parking valet was always helpful and in fact each of the valets went out of their way to load our chairs and umbrella in the car before bringing it to us, a very nice touch. Miles the security guard was friendly and courteous. The shining star however was Yasmin, the bartender for the COMPLIMENTARY cocktail time this hotel offers. She was sweet, sassy, and fun to talk with. In addition to the free drinks there were also light snacks which was nice to enjoy before heading out to dinner on the town or for the fireworks on the beach. I know people complain about the amenities fee, but for $20 a day it helped cut the cost of our breakfast down to $12 for two people and we never had to rent chairs and an umbrella at the many beaches we visited (which by the way was $36 for 2 chairs and and umbrella daily). We also prepaid our parking when we made our reservation which gave us a discount on that as well. There is an ABC store (convenience store) attached to the hotel that offers a wide range of food, drinks, beach apparel, souvenirs, and even alcohol. We loved our stay here and plan to stay again the next time we are in Oahu. P.S. the hotel also has a guest laundry and while the pool was under renovation, we didn't miss it. There are way too many beaches to enjoy to sit at a pool. Picture taken from one of our two balconies.",Jan 2019,January 2019,Traveled as a couple,,"Arlington, Texas"

647257206,50,Fantastic start to our honeymoon <3,"We planned to stay here on the first night of our honeymoon trip. We decided to book another night, and Erica was very helpful with that! Our room was NOT what we expected...it was WAY better! It was on the top floor with two walls of sliding glass doors looking out to the ocean/Waikiki on one side and the skyline of Honolulu on the other. The bed was done up in a romantic way (don't want to ruin the surprise for other honeymooners). We loved the lanai, wish we had more time for it. The TV was the biggest TV either of us has ever seen and I was personally a huge fan of how many pillows were on the bed. The shower was great, too. There was a Keurig in the room. After the first night, housekeeping came in and cleaned everything and gave us more coffee and towels and made our bed. The location was perfect, the workers were beyond nice and the breakfast buffet was great. There is always coffee/tea/juice/water in the lobby. The pool was being renovated, but they did say we could go to the neighbor hotel, The Ambassador, to swim in their pool.

He spoke very highly of his staff and ensured us that we were in good hands and we definitely were. The staff was very accommodating to our group and we enjoyed our stay. We were sad to leave the property and Hawaii but definitely would recommend this hotel. No pool at this hotel but we didn't travel to Hawaii to swim in a pool.

We were recommended Hotel Lacroix by a friend and I am happy to say that we made the right decision. I'm also not the type of person not to go out of his way to write a review but our experience went so well I had to write one. I wanted to share how great the hotel staff is, everyone is enthusiastic, happy, and doing the little things such as saying ""hello"" and holding doors for you. More specifically, I wanted to share my experience with Hee, the breakfast supervisor/manager, of how accommodating, polite, and sincere he was. Even though it probably wasn't in his job description, he went above and beyond to recommend all that there is to do in Hawaii and provided the best service for our breakfast (he also makes the best waffles!). The hotel room that we got was very clean and simple. We were fortunate enough to have a corner room which included a very pleasant city view. The hotel is also conveniently walking distance to a lot of great places to eat and the beach.

643932596,40,"Friendly & responsive staff, economical cost/quality/convenience balance.","We found the staff here to be supremely responsive and accommodating at every level. A malfunctioning TV remote, to give just one example, was replaced within minutes by a maintenance employee who came to our room after we notified the desk.    The hotel itself is located directly in the center of Waikiki, but tucked a few blocks further back from the beach. Most rooms have either a city view or an obstructed ocean view, but this is to be expected of a three-star resort with such reasonable pricing. A plenitude of high-end shopping and mid-range restaurants are within a few blocks in any direction. It is recommended that you explore more economical parking options than what the hotel offers, including a convenient one just across the street.    The hotel currently runs a discounted breakfast buffet; an impressive variety of prepared food for 12 bucks a person ‚Äî we enjoyed the atmosphere and the energy brought by the other guests along with the great food.    The room is the only reason we can‚Äôt give this experience five stars. We requested a room with one queen bed, under the mistaken assumption that the absence of a second bed would mean more space to move around. This strategy backfired, and it turns out that a room with one queen bed is half the size of a room with two queen beds, even though both are listed at comparable prices. Our room was so small that there wasn‚Äôt even sufficient space to put bedside stands. This means: nowhere to set your phone, nowhere to hit a light switch within reach of lying down, place the TV/AC remote, etc. In addition, our bed may have been a full-size bed, not a queen as was advertised. Our room didn‚Äôt come with a microwave, but one was promptly brought upon request. We were grateful for the quality and versatility of the air-conditioner, which also helped rid the room of a slight mildew smell. (The hallway, at least on the 10th floor, smelled really funky.) And as for the bed itself, what can I say? It was squishy as you would expect many regular mattresses to be. Neither of us slept very well during our five-night stay, but in comparison to sleeping on our Tempur-pedic at home, perhaps this is to be expected.    To be fair, if we had brought our bed concerns to the attention of the staff after the first night, they probably would have moved heaven and earth to get us a firmer and higher-quality mattress, or even switch us to a bigger room. But given how miraculously they accommodated us with a last-minute Holiday reservation, we were simply grateful to be there and considered it out of place to make further demands.",Jan 2019,January 2019,Traveled as a couple,,"San Francisco, California"

Standard charge for everything, wifi is free, but not as high speed as I wanted to be, enough for checking emails.  Breakfast buffet is $16 per person, but each hotel room comes with a $20 credit and kids eat for free as long as they are accompanied by adults. The breakfast is good, with all the standard items, also has a good omelette station.  They give you beach towel card to exchange for the towel, as long as you return the towel, no charge will be added.  The most expensive part is the parking, $29/night for unlimited in & out access, it only comes with valet parking, no self-serves, and since this is the first time I am in Hawaii, I did not bother looking for anything else, but for sure I will do that for next time.    Experience:  1. Finding the valet parking was a bit difficult since the entrance to valet parking is not on the same side as the front door, plus the hotel name not the same and the one way street around the block, it wasn't that great experience to start off with.  2. Parking, once you get to the parking lot, the staff was very helpful. He helped with the luggage as well calling another staffs to move all the luggage to our room  3. Checking-in, it was simple and easy, given our reservation has multiple rooms and people are coming in at different time, the front desk staff was very nice to explain everything (actually to the point with every details), but I was so hungry at that time and did not pay too much attention.  4. Hotel room, typical size hotel room, I didn't expect too much for the amenities given with the great location and it's price. But it does need some basic upgrades, such as missing coffee machine, more stable wifi, and the most important of all, there is no vent in the washroom, which is quite a disappointment. (Also, it was raining in Waikiki on Saturday, and my friend's room has water dripping from the ceiling)  5. Daily activities, they actually provide a lot of items for free, from umbrellas to water equipment such as surf board, and also doing a good providing activities information in Waikiki and around Oahu island.  6. Cleanliness, I recommend bringing your own towel for drying after shower and flip flops. Not that I see any problems, but my ankles has small bite mark after I walked around barefoot for the first 2 nights. I cannot confirm if the bites are from the hotel or outside, so I am not going to penalize them for it.  7. Checking out, simple transaction, front desk provided all the explanation of the charged items, but this is where I think the hotels earned a lot of points.    Good Experience:  So after I checked out, they called a staff member to help with the luggage from the room back to the car. The staff name is Lucy. A, and she literally helped with everything without my help. Then my wife was having concern if the luggage is over weight, and I said we have no way to tell until we get to the airport. Lucy then when downstairs and bring a scale back to weight our luggage, and one of them was indeed over weight. So, we know we will need to transfer some items from one to the other, she then offered help but given with so much private items, we declined her request and she left. We then went back inside the room to re-organize, and as we are about to finish and call the front desk again, Lucy came back to the door and ask if everything is done. We were amazed that she took her time to come back and check on us to make sure everything is ok. She then moved everything downstairs to parking and onto the car, initially I was afraid that it won't fit because with the extra items we got in Hawaii, but then she magically fitted everything inside the car. I am pretty amazed with her ability, but more importantly, her willingness to go above and beyond for making sure all the guests in the hotel have a pleasant time.    Thank you very much for offering such a service, and I will recommend this hotel to my family & friends in the future given with the wonderful service and excellent location, but I would really recommend they can do minor upgrades to their amenities.",Dec 2018,December 2018,Traveled with friends,Try to request rooms that are not close to the elevator,"Toronto, Canada"

At the restaurant, they had an omelette station and a waffle station...amazing! The food was great and way better than expected. However, I think what made it over the top was the service. Our server, Mel, was so nice and warm. He made us feel so welcomed. And on top of that, was Johnny on the spot with everything we needed.

Its not a big full service resort. Its smaller and intimate. The staff is friendly and attentive and do their best to welcome and take care of you. In particular, Liz went above and beyond. Our room faced the park and had a distant ocean view. The sunsets from our 2 lanais were beautiful. The room was spacious and modern. The staff had decorated our room with flowers and signs for our anniversary and included a hand written note wishing us well.    The hotel has a restaurant that has a great breakfast. The beach chairs, beach towels, boogie boards, etc are all complimentary. On our last day we also received a hand written note thanking us for our stay.

The hotel is inexpensive, in a convenient location, and looked good in reviews and pictures on TripAdvisor. Perfect for someone traveling alone.    The room was clean and everything was in good working order. The bed was more comfortable than expected (my expectations for hotel beds are extremely low). The location is walking distance from the beach, shopping, and some primo Japanese foodüòã. The pool is currently closed for renovations, but who goes to Hawaii for the hotel pools? Unfortunately, that came with some needle gun noise, but not a big deal.    There was a happy hour on Friday (free drinksüçª) which I really, really took advantage ofüòÜ. Super fun time! Have to say that the best part of my stay was the hotel staff. Everyone was very helpful and friendly, especially Liz at the front desk, absolute sweetheart!

634153968,30,Not fantastic!,"We booked this hotel as a last minute thing, when we decided to stay on longer in waikiki after our wedding. We were staying at the outrigger reef, but decided it was too expensive to stay any longer.    We knew this hotel was being renovated but the reviews had said that it was good and staff were nice. As the price was reasonable and in a good location to still be able to get to the beach quickly we went with it! Roughly ¬£100 a night including taxes.    We were on the 7th floor and the room looked clean and fresh, but on closer inspection we had several issues with the room. Worst of which was the single  Glazing patio door which when closed there was still a large gap and this let in a-lot of traffic noise from the busy Kalakaua avenue. The curtains didn‚Äôt meet properly and the hook when i pulled the curtains to close came off in my hand.    The laundry room had 2 washing machines and 2 dryers not enough for the size of the hotel and there was no change machine or ability to buy washing powder. We had to go to the front desk for quarters and luckily had soap powder already.    The staff were lovely especially the bell hop on the first day we arrived! (Im sorry i have forgotten his name, believe began with a K).    The ability to have beach towels and beach equipment for free was a big plus and i made use of these, including taking the snorkelling gear to Hanauma Bay saving me $12 on hiring equipment there!    The hotel is in a great location has an ABC downstairs and is a 5minute walk to the main shops and bars.  However this hotel is in need of a-lot of renovation.

618051412,50,Excellent Customer Service!,Upon my arrival to this hotel I was hesitant being that I had read so much negative reviews about the Waikiki gateway hotel (now La Croix hotel).    I arrived at about 8:15 in the morning not knowing that check in wasn't until 3:00 p.m.    The girl at the front desk was very professional and she related that my room was not ready however she placed me into a different room. I do believe that the housekeeper had not gotten to the room I was now checking into being that it was so early in the morning and the previous person might have just checked out.    I let the housekeeper know.... I eventually got my things settled and got ready for my day and left    I am not one to make a scene with management if I am unhappy however the management had heard of the situation and had contacted me via phone.    I am so grateful for the manager Pearl who took it upon herself to address a situation that she did not need to. She contacted me personally and apologized on behalf of the hotel.

604007564,50,Good tourist class hotel at a reasonable price,I stayed for five nights in early August and had a positive experience.    The hotel is approaching the end of some upgrades and I guess I had one of the new look rooms which was absolutely fine. It was small(ish) but had everything I needed and was clean with a comfortable bed.    Breakfast was great every day with no problems finding a table and lots of choice of food. Having the ABC convenience store in the lobby was very handy for picking up a few things when I needed them.    Having read some of the previous reviews I was a bit concerned before I came but this was unfounded. With the Gateway / La Croix you get what you pay for. Waikiki isn‚Äôt a cheap place to stay and its completely unfair to compare this hotel to luxury hotels further into the centre of Waikiki that cost three of four times more a night. You pay your money and you take your choice.    It‚Äôs a bit of a stroll to restaurants etc. but no more than 5 or 10 minutes. Handy for the convention centre in the other direction though if that‚Äôs why you are coming to Waikiki.    Some street noise but it never bothered my sleep.    My only concern was a break in at a low level room that happened whilst I was staying. Someone apparently climbed up a ladder and came in through the balcony and grabbed some valuables that weren‚Äôt in the safe. The good news was the staff managed to confront the intruder and he fled leaving everything behind. Higher level rooms might be best as is the case in any hotel where you have a choice.,Aug 2018,August 2018,Traveled solo,,

Phone call made and all stopped. Next night same thing happened. Another phone call stopped all. Third and final night enough was enough. Called front desk and Wayne came to our rescue. He sent security and security made it so that never heard a peep again. Now, I know that most hotels take a proactive approach, but Wayne made sure our last night was quiet. Wayne was our savior and I can not thank him enough.    Hotel is very boutique in nature, close to the beach, right in the center of downtown and was a great stay besides what happen.

599613826,10,Good for One night if you have to,"When we arrived to the hotel, we realized the entire place (including the pool) was under construction. So, first impression was not good. They have valet parking, but when we went to use it, they told us there was no room for the car. They told us we could park across the street if we wanted. Really?? Granted, we had a large SUV, but if you advertise valet parking, you better have it. After numerous conversations with the parking attendent and the front desk, they suddenly found a spot for the car. The rooms were not good. We had 2 separate rooms; One with 2 queen size beds and only 2 towels; no tissues; cracks in the walls and showers. The other was the 4 twin beds-which as my son stated the beds were like bean bags. They advertise beach towels, but they ran out. Front desk staff were nice, but nice doesn't cut it when everything else was poor. They also put a $100 hold on my credit card for any incidentals - which they said could be a pending item for about a month. Not too thrilled with that either. When we were ready to leave, we asked the front desk to get car-that took 3 tries to get it. We waited 25 minutes for them to get their act together and get the car-first they forgot to ask-2nd they either couldn't find it or forgot-3rd again couldn't find it or forgot.

Renovations are still occurring to modernise the hotel and I understand this. But these should not be happening around the clock. They were painting non-stop and these fumes were prevalent through the floor. They were even painting at 10o‚Äôclcok on a Sunday night.  My wife and I were allocated a shoe box (room 1508) and we could not even get around the bed at the same time. Apparently this room has been renovated but the workmanship is very poor all round. Power points have been painted over, painting is poor, tiles have been painted over, fridge was dented and is already flaking and mould is already forming above the bathtub.  There was no suitable storage as there were no bedside tables (they would not fit anyway) and the only closet was in the bathroom. The bathroom had no ventilation at all and therefore our clothes became damp whenever you showered.

597931661,20,Would not stay here again,"There are a few good things about this hotel: the location is good, the staff are extremely polite and helpful as other reviewers have mentioned, and there is an ABC store right in the lobby to buy your flipflops, sunscreen, sunglasses or whatever else you forgot.    Two really bad things will prevent us from going back or recommending it, however:    1) We found the prices/benefits quite misleading and annoying. When we booked we were told we would get a $20 credit for the breakfast buffet each morning. I barely eat breakfast so we figured this would be fine. What they don't tell you is that each person's visit to the breakfast buffet costs $15.95, so really, you aren't getting anything - you will have to pay. The credit is *per room*, so unless you are staying alone, you are not getting breakfast included here, and there is no way to stay below $20, even if one of you only wants tea. Our final bill also had a $20/night ""NEW amenity fee!"" in addition to the usual resort fee, and when we asked what it included, they listed items that are completely standard even at the Motel 6, like the fridge, TV, and room safe.    2) Our room may have been cleaned but it was musty and old. Our lampshade had mildew all over it and the bathroom was gross - the shower floor was so dirty that I wanted to wear my socks while showering. Also the ""lanai"" is just a very, very skinny patio with rickety chairs and no shade and much of the space taken up by the air conditioner backing.

595923479,50,Great location,"This is a fantastic hotel. Note though that one person gets a free breakfast, anyone else in the room has an additional charge ($15-$20, I don't exactly recall the actual number). But! Location is perfect for the shopper and beach goer alike.  It was a nice leisure walk through Ainahau Triangle and Fort Derussy Beach Park to reach the beach. If you happen to wake up early enough I recommend a walk to the beach to catch the beach prior to the crowds. The sunrise behind you will make Diamond Head to the left look spectacular and you get to see the city slowly wake up.  For the shopper, it is a short walk to the Kalakaua Ave shopping area. It took us less than 10min to get to the Waikiki Shopping Plaza. If i recall they have a show in tue evening there as well. Granted this particular info is from almost 10 years ago.

The hotel is in a great location, with only a 10min walk to the beach and close to many nice restaurants and shopping. The excitement ends there. The rooms leave a lot to be desired. First, there was a musty damp odor. The furniture looked old and used. The bathroom shower looked really bad. It had marked up tiles and grout that looked so awful that I kept my eyes closed while showering. We made sure to stay busy, so we did not have to stay in the room long. We had two rooms. The other room was only slightly better than ours. Luckily, we only had to stay there 2 days before moving to a different hotel.

The not-so-good: currently undergoing ""refreshing"" with some floors in unfinished state, and pool area closed for the summer (though they do give access to the pool at a neighboring hotel.)

587743000,40,Good- but not great,"The good bits; location, staff, breakfast, view  The not so good- we were unfortunate to arrive when we did for three reasons; the pool was closed for renovation (will be for the whole summer) the room next door was being done up so there was an overwhelming smell of paint and there was a letter posted thru the door saying there would be some 'minor noise' due to ongoing works. I can assure you that unless you work in a coal mine or resurfacing roads- this was not minor. The drilling started at 0900 and went on all day. I appreciate that the hotel is trying to better itself (also including a confusing name change) but the noise was awful- happily however the room was for sleeping and the pool was simply a bonus as the beach is not far away.

586834395,40,Good for the price and close to local buses,"This hotel is quite comfortable and close to where you need to catch the local bus. It‚Äôs about a 10 minute walk to the centre of Waikiki. I found the beds quite comfortable and noise level pretty good whilst nodding off to sleep. Stayed somewhere else the first time I was in Waikiki and had the noise of bins being emptied at 5am, thank goodness not here!    I‚Äôll agree with other reviews that the bathroom is quite small. The bath could do with some tlc as it was a bit grubby.    The hotel does need to invest in some more PowerPoints in the room (found the one in the bathroom didn‚Äôt work) and some better lighting.    Also the balconies weren‚Äôt inviting to sit on at all. A little bit of the railing has come off and the air conditioning unit was dripping down onto the balcony.    All in all for the price it‚Äôs good value. We did use the $20 credit towards breakfast a few times. The food wasn‚Äôt too bad either and a good deal as Waikiki food I found is generally not cheap.    If you‚Äôre after value and don‚Äôt mind a walk to the beach then don‚Äôt hesitate to book here.

585909523,30,"It is a gateway, not the centre","As the name suggests, the hotel is situated at the entrance to Waikiki, so it is not really the centre of attractions and activities. You'll need to walk a fair way (about 25 minutes) or take a bus to get to the city centre. There are a few restaurants and shops nearby but not much choice.  The room itself was reasonably clean and quiet, but the taps and bathroom tiles were a bit run down. Space was sufficient. The buffet breakfast offered a limited choice of food, and the food quality was average, except for the pineapples which were juicy and sweet. The toaster is designed in such a way that thicker bread or roll cannot fit in. While we were there, someone pushed a piece of bread through. The bread got stuck and over-heated and burnt, and the toaster caught a small fire. After putting out the fire, the staff did not put any warning sign on it and left the toaster to be used, as if nothing had happened.  The front desk staff were friendly and helpful. Not a bad place to stay if you are on budget, but be prepared for walking in the heat and for the inconveniences of living away from the centre (unless you are driving).",Jun 2018,May 2018,,,"Hong Kong, China"

582345566,30,"Good location, but hotel is tired and the ""remodel"" isn't enough","This hotel is in a good area - it's right at the start of all the great shopping and eating on Kalakaua Ave, the staff are friendly, and the foyer gives a good first impression. It is reasonably priced compared to many of its neighbours, but those thinking they've found an outright bargain should beware that the photos of the ""remodelled"" rooms build expectations that aren't quite met.    This is (I would estimate) a 1950's building that is in need of serious attention, not just cosmetic. Everything from the crumbling popcorn ceilings to the wiring to the glazing is old and tired. And while the rooms are redecorated in nice colours and decent furniture, they haven't really addressed these deeper issues. There are many visible signs of deterioration, particularly on the balconies and railings. In the pool area, rather than repair / replace the corroded railings they've just put painted ply / chip-board in front of them to give the illusion of new. The balcony immediately above the swimming pool is scarily bowing in the middle, and doesn't look at all safe to me. I wouldn't sit on it. Speaking of the swimming pool, it is very small and the goes from 3ft to 7ft in just a few steps. Wouldn't really be suitable for inexperienced swimmers or young kids.    Our room seemed clean enough when we first checked-in, but by the end of our five-night stay the sheets hadn't been changed, the bathroom was being cleaned on the sink only and amenities refreshed while the toilet/bath/floor/walls hadn't been cleaned once. The mouldy ceiling and dirty grouting around the bathroom tiles made it feel even grubbier. Its location means there is a LOT of traffic and the noise of this goes on nearly all night, so if you're a light sleeper you may struggle. On the plus side, we heard no noise from other occupants and the rooms are spacious with pleasant furniture and with nice views.    If you really want to be in this area and can't justify the cost of many of the alternatives, this hotel is ok as long as you don't expect the quality that the hotel is trying to convey via its marketing. If you're ok with just ok, then it's just ok.",May 2018,May 2018,Traveled with family,,

580089633,50,Kitchenette rooms spacious and perfect for infants!,"My wife, bubba and I enjoyed our stay in Waikiki Gateway hotel. The rooms were definitely more spacious then other similar hotels. The hotel is old but is currently undergoing transformation into a boutique hote. Rooms were recently refreshed and furnishings were new (except the shower/bathware). The hotel was nice enough to provide us a cot for the baby on request. We really loved the location of the hotel. It was close to the shops in Waikiki but also remained within walking distance to the Hawaiian convention centre and Ala Moana Centre. There was a convenience store just downstairs where we could find most essential stuff. The beach was not too far away, though our only gripe was the $20 amenity fee for a hotel not directly in front of the beach. They made up for this with $20 breakfast credit (cost $16pp) but they don't allow accumulating credit. We ended up paying a $12 top up for two people. The hotel was also directly across from a park which leads to the historical Battery Randolph/Army museum - def worth a visit (free entry). If you are not renting a car, most tours offer pick up from this hotel as there is a tour bus waiting bay downstairs. This might be an issue if you are a light sleeper as the sound insulation from the balcony is poor. Also the wifi provided by the hotel was horrible and kept dropping out. We had best signals in the bathroom.. but it wasn't a deal-breaker as we had a tourist sim card. Overall, it was the excellent cleanliness, housekeeping, comfort and amenities that won us over.

We decided to return to pick them up and they made it easy for us to retrieve them from their lost and found Department. They offer a large breakfast for guests for an additional nominal fee which made it very convenient for our family. We will surely return and recommend them to others. Objectively, the only thing they weren‚Äôt too great about was their vallet parking. The attendants there were not very organized or attentive to detail because they mixed up all our luggage and sent them to the wrong rooms. Also, the common bathroom next to the lobby didn‚Äôt have soap for our entire stay. When we brought it to their attention, they didnt make it a priority to fix.

It was decent, but with all of the choices in the area we only ate there twice. The hotel staff was incredible and so accommodating. They give you two (or how many are in your room) key cards for beach towels so you don‚Äôt have to buy and deal with the sand all in your room. The valet guys were so awesome and gave us wonderful suggestions to go try. Easiest thing to do is do your day trips around the island in your personal car and Uber at night time. The location is perfect. Walking distance to everything, 5 minutes to the beach, just across the park. Everything is close especially H1 East and West which will put you close to any beach on the island.

Now the bad: The room was tiny and uncomfortable, the bed hard, there was no chair, there was only one light in the room, a table lamp (the staff did supply us with a second table lamp when I asked for one), while the lights in the bathroom were overwhelmingly bright. There was no desk for my computer (nor room for one). There was no place to charge phones. The room was clean and neat, but spartan -- it reminded me of European budget hotels. There was a $20/night ""resort"" fee we did not expect in spite of the hotel being blocks from the beach.",Mar 2018,March 2018,Traveled as a couple,,"Boston, Massachusetts"

Arriving on a friday night, I was the last reservation to check in. Darwin (at the front desk) suprised me with an upgrade to a Penthouse Terrace room. #3. He said he thought I would like this room. He wasn't kidding. Top of the building with an amazing view of Waikiki. My room was a corner room so I had 2 sliders and a large ""L"" shaped balcony. The rooms were clean and nicely decorated. The Breakfast Buffet, which Darwin also included, was great, and very convieniant. I've been to Waikiki quite a few times. Always looking for good deals on rooms.

566620736,50,Another EXCELLENT stay!!,"My family of 5 stayed at the Waikiki Gateway Hotel (aka La Croix) for 3 nights and 4 days. Mr. Darwin S. assisted us with our reservations once again. He arranged that we had a very comfortable spacious room to accommodate our big family. The room he got us was a newly renovated room on the 8th floor in the corner end and it had 2 big beds and 2 balconies. The high-speed wifi worked this time around. We were very satisfied with our stay again I must say. Darwin is a very personable guy and always caring of your needs. He is truly such an assest to the hotel. Like I‚Äôve said in my past review, I stay at many 3-5 star hotels weekly for work but this hotel stands out and it keeps me and my family coming back.    Typical Waikiki Gateway Hotel fashion, during our stay there, we were recieved with friendly greetings in the morning by the lovely ladies in the front desk. Then, we would walk straight to breakfast area and be greeted daily with a smile by the sweetest breakfast staff Haley and Grace. Breakfast buffet is so tasty my kids look forward to it every morning. That‚Äôs all they remembered when we stayed there last time was the breakfast. For me, I liked the fried rice, scrambled eggs, crispy bacon, miso soup, and the iced passion fruit-orange juice. After breakfast, Miles who is head security who‚Äôs a big dude would greet my kids with a smile and talk to them. Warren who‚Äôs is valet would greet us and chat with us when getting our van in the basement garage. When we would sometimes hit the Waikiki beach 5 minutes walk away, we‚Äôd loan beach chairs from the front desk ladies.    Importantly, what makes us come back to this hotel first and foremost is the personable-friendly-accomodating staff. Without them, we would not stay here for real. It makes a world of a difference. Second, is the location. It‚Äôs at the beginning of Waikiki, so the hustle and bustle of tourists is not found here making it quiter than further down the street. Convenience is all around the hotel such as the ABC store in the hotel itself, tons of restaurants nearby, retail stores down the street, a park across the street, and bus stop in front which we took to/from the airport (The Bus #19, #20 for $2.75 o/w or $5 for aday pass). There is really no need for a car rental unless you plan to drive around the island which did. But if you plan to stay at the Waikiki area only, then the Waikiki Gateway is the perfect location for that.    But great job again Waikiki Gateway hotel.

Check-in was smooth and quick, and the front desk staff was very friendly.  The room - The price difference between the deluxe room and the Studio/balcony corner was small on my dates, so I went for the studio. The room was on the 11th floor, spacious and clean, but perhaps a bit outdated, even with the ongoing renovations. The view was great. Moderate street noise which I personally had no problems with (earplugs if you're a very light sleeper).  Location - Very convenient. 7min walk from the Royal Hawaiian Center, 25min walk to Ala Moana Mall. There's a bunch of shops and restaurants around too. Pink and Green Trolley lines stops here as well.    The price and convenience are a plus. Some may complain about the outdated facilities but most hotels in Hawaii are.

Constructive criticisms: Have some glasses in the room as opposed to paper cups. Also need a kettle (shouldn't have to ask). This all-too-prevelant 'resort charge' is a rip off. It was $20 per head per night for what I would expect to be included in the price. For example, if a hotel has a pool and a gym I don't expect to be charged over and above the advertised price. Put an ice tray in the freezer. Put a light on the balcony. Put some connections in the room for iPhones etc.    Beware of the extra charges when you book, be aware of some minor improvements that they should make and it's still not a bad hotel.",Mar 2018,March 2018,Traveled as a couple,Ask for an upgrade to the 16th floor.

This year was the start of our 30th Wedding Anniversary Tour so we decide to start in Hawaii. The room was spacious and clean and well equipped for a 2 week stay, a microwave, Keurig, with of course Kona coffee and fridge. A small safe of valuables also came in handy.    The house keeping staff was very responsive to requests, especially ""Mhila"" she was like having a favorite sister or aunt taking care of you. Mahalo Mhila for all the help.    The location was just a short walk to the beach and was central to nearly every activity we planned and did. We rented scooters for 1 week and toured the southern part of the island and had a ball. Parking at the hotel was convenient, but pricey in my opinion, but space is a premium of an island.    Breakfast was served each morning and pretty much the same each day, I would recommend adding more variety to the menu.

I made the reservation fairly last minute and just wanted something cheap. The staff at this hotel were SO incredible - we got to the hotel around 10:30 and begged for an early check in, so our young children could get settled and take naps. The staff had us in a room by 11 am. CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH how appreciated that was.    The rooms themselves are pretty basic, but then again, the price is good. The coffee maker in our unit was malfunctioning a bit, and we noticed basic cosmetic things that could be fixed/repaired. But the air conditioner worked and the room was clean - that's all we really cared about. They already had a crib in the room as requested for my daughter.    Breakfast buffet was $6 in the morning and was an interesting mix of traditional Asian breakfast and American breakfast. Good coffee and sure, I'll take a plate of half fried rice, half eggs! Parking was $29 and the only option was valet, but the valet staff was really nice. In fact I have to extend that to every employee we interacted with. All extremely friendly, caring people. In particular: Kaola, Mallory, Roland and Leia. Sorry if I am totally messing up the spelling!

558928169,30,Good Choice for Waikiki,"This hotel is in the process of being rebranded to ""Hotel La Croix"" (which created some confusion for guests we watched step out of a taxi and think they were in the wrong place as the new signs were up).    We found the staff to be very friendly and helpful.    The rooms were simple, basic, modernish in d√©cor, with pleasant light blue walls and some artwork. There was hardwood laminate flooring, along with carpet around the beds, which were comfortable. The room had a nice HD TV, and decent selection of channels. The dresser and night stand were basic/older (maybe to be replaced as part of renovations?). The fridge came in handy. The bathroom had a nice-sized vanity. The tub was old, but the shower had good shower pressure. Would have been nice to have a few more cloths. Hot water was limited at times.    There was some sound transfer from adjacent rooms.    The balcony was spacious enough - there were a couple worn out patio chairs (maybe to be replaced also?).    The pool area was tidy. It was not very modern. The pool was very small, as was the pool area, but it was not crowded as many guests would enjoy the sun from their balconies or go to the beach. There was a nice view from the pool deck, onto Kalakaua Avenue, Fort DeRussy Park, in the direction of the ocean.    We did not partake in the breakfast buffet, nor did we use the laundry room.    We did make use of the beach chairs and umbrella (included as hotel amenities), which we took to the beach. This was a nice feature.    The location of the hotel is great; only a few blocks away from the busier part of Waikiki with its restaurants and shops, but far enough away from that same commotion. The beach is a nice walk away (about 10 to 15 minutes), through Fort DeRussy Park. There is a small ABC on the main floor, and a Dean & Deluca just 1 block away, at the Ritz-Carlton.    A turn-off during our stay - there was a sewer smell throughout the property, and it was very noticeable in our room each time we entered, for the first few minutes until our noses adjusted to it. The City was apparently having problems with the sewer lines during our stay which may have lead to some gas unfortunately backing up into the hotel room.    Generally speaking, this property still looks and smells old in places, but you can tell there is renovation work ongoing, and they are working hard to freshen up the place, likely as part of the rebranding.

We really liked the location ‚Äì a short walk to the beach, a short walk to Ala Moana mall, and plenty of good restaurants around. We also liked the fact that there are a couple of Biki bike-share stands just outside the hotel, so very easy to get around. The hotel seems to have been fairly newly renovated, so generally modern and up to date. Our room was a bit on the small side which was disappointing, as we felt a bit cramped at times. There was not really any good place to store clothes, bags, and other things (no closet). Views are decent out the window, obviously better the higher you go up ‚Äì we could just catch a glimpse of the ocean from our balcony. The room was clean and comfortable with good AC and a TV with full range of cable channels. Also, the free high-speed internet was a great bonus. All windows/doors were just single-pane so we had to contend with a lot of road noise which was annoying. There is a small gym on the first floor with lots of new equipment. All of the cardio gear is new and high quality, but the weights equipment is very limited. The room itself is tiny with no space to do any floor work, and effectively only about 1-2 people can lift weights at any one time. Also, the AC wasn‚Äôt working, and there was no remote control, so our workout turned into a serious sweat-fest!

If I had to criticize anything at the hotel - (1) the egg preparations at breakfast could possibly be better and more varied (from day to day) and there could, maybe, be more breakfast meat options (instead of just the alternating bacon-and-sausage option) and (2) the shower/tub in our room was a bit dated (although it worked OK, and was never a real problem).",Dec 2017,December 2017,Traveled as a couple,"Noise from traffic is a bit of an issue, even at the higher floors... but the ""ocean...","St. John's, Canada"

I was made to feel at home during the time there. The view over downtown Honolulu was beautiful..The walk to the beachfront strip for shopping is a few minutes away.

542219600,40,Exceeded expectations!,"My husband and I stayed here as part of our honeymoon. We were in Waikiki beach for 3 nights. We thought that compared to other hotels in the area, the Gateway was reasonably priced.    The quality of the hotel was great. We had a room with 2 balconies! Our room was clean and spacious. It had a fridge and small kitchenette (sink, dishes, microwave, etc). The kitchen was stocked with some silverware, plates, and glasses. There is no corkscrew, but the front desk will happily open your wine for you. The service at this hotel is something that all of the other reviews mention and we would absolutely agree with this. The staff were helpful and friendly to us the entire time we were there.    The A/C works well and keeps the room quite cool. The hotel was quiet enough that sleep was not disrupted, but there is some street noise. It didn't bother us at all, but if you sleep with the windows open I guess it could. It seemed to me that street noise started quite early in Hawaii. They seem to be early risers!    What we didn't know about this hotel before we booked was that it also offers a very good breakfast buffet for a subsidized price ($5.95/day for hotel guests). I don't think you could find a breakfast of that quality for that price anywhere else in the area. We ate there daily for breakfast and really appreciated this.    We felt the location of this hotel was very convenient. Waikiki beach is full of tourist attractions - restaurants, shops, etc. This hotel was definitely not far from anything (including bus stops). The beach was also quite a short walk.    The one thing that we were not quite as impressed with was the ""hotel service/amenity fee"" charged to us at check-out. The hotel added $80 on to our bill at check-out stating that we had agreed to it when checking in to our room (although they could not show us where in the agreement we had signed up for this). We ended up working this out in the end, but just be aware that this could happen and pay attention to the final charges.

537037725,20,Dated facilities,"This hotel was built in 1971 and although it has had a few face lifts it remains a pretty dated hotel. Beware of the room size on the lower levels. We barely had room to swing a cat but were moved when we asked due to the dripping taps and the noisy fridge.  The facilities are pretty poor with only one washing machine to service the entire 17 floors. There were two driers however. The gym wasn't of much use to the more sporty people so they went to another facility nearby. The pool was very small and cloudy. It didn't get many visitors in the two weeks I was there. There were five old sun loungers that were sore on the back as the steel protruded. The most annoying thing I suppose is the general amenities tax you are charged as you check out. While most hotels charge this fee I would hope that the ""amenities"" were better elsewhere.  A major plus for this hotel was the staff. They were all very friendly and helpful. The housekeeping staff were in particular very nice and made our room look like it was on the first day everyday.

The hotel has great service, almost all the staff were genuinely happy to see the guests and helpful, fast, professional and polite. In Hawai'i friendliness seems to be in the water and, being a somewhat reserved Brit, I wondered if it would grate, but it didn't because for the vast majority of my stay, all smiles seemed to come from the heart. One of the best examples of that was my housekeeper, Mhila Talledo; I only saw her once, at the end of my stay by accident in the corridor but she was so lovely and sweet. She kept my room spotlessly clean and well made up. Thank you, Mhila :-) The rooms are fine, with great views out towards Honolulu (on my side of the building), but definitely not all sea views, just so you know (it's over a kilometre to the water I think. The rooms are looking a bit tired, but they are very clean. The hotel lobby is newly renovated but the breakfast room really needs a make-over. Breakfast were pretty good with a large selection. Sausages were awesome :-) There is an amenities charge (optional) which, if you only ever take advantage of the breakfast part probably isn't worth it; do the maths before you agree to it.

The room was dated, small and very hot, the AC was to small to even cool down the room, it was a corner room with 2 balconies that didn‚Äôt help prevent the heat from coming in. The bathroom was dirty, floor had lint‚Äôs and hair, it needed a good scrub down. Carpet needed vacuuming. On the fifth floor so it was noisy with the traffic. Needless to say I was at the front desk letting them know.  So the staff were very apologetic and offered the get us another room except it was smaller and no kitchenette and the same size AC this did not cut it for me, it‚Äôs not what I booked for.  So they offer to thoroughly clean the room and give the AC a chance to cool the room. While we went out for lunch. On our return the room was a little cleaner and a little cooler.

Bahrain, Tunisia, Greece, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Guatemala, Paris, Amsterdam and so many more - this would've been 4 stars instead of 5 for sure! The people are great that work here for the most part, Miles is another huge asset to this establishment, but there are a few that need to communicate things a bit better in order for things to go a bit smoother during your stay. All in all a great value for what you pay considering other choices, but the daily parking fee is quite the rip off given the fact that I can go to Walmart, The Mall etc and not even spend the value of one nights stay yet park for free there so I should certainly park for free when I'm staying at this hotel. Especially for a lengthy stay. Once the entire place is updated it will be even better but if you're looking for a budget friendly location that has great customer service with the absolute friendliest staff on the planet (pretty good breakfast as well, although it would be nice if they would offer more warm choices as well as change it up a bit for those of us staying extendedly) pretty close to the beach, public transportation and lots of restaurants and shops the give this place a try for sure!!!!

Like many other mentioned the breakfast is the big plus in the hotel, plenty of food and a nice start of the day that you don't have to go somewhere else.

It is convenient to shopping in a very exclusive area and buses pick up right outside the door.  The rooms were clean, airy and light. The beds were comfortable. It is on a major street so there is some street noise but nothing out of the ordinary.  The bathroom was not too convenient in that it lacks shelf space but it was large enough. Everything is in one room, however..the tub/shower and the sink.  The free breakfast was the best! It is a buffet with everything one could want, hot food, cold food, great coffee, lots of fruit...excellent.  Parking in the hotel basement is expensive, but hotel guests get a discount.

513988433,40,Perfect Location ! Awesome Passion - Orange -/ Guava Fruit Juice !,"5 Reasons Why you have to stay here :    5. The location is perfect, it is located right in the heart of the city. You do not need to drive a car or take a taxi to move around. Everything is walking distance, close proximity to the beach, bus / trolley stops, restaurants, bars, convenience stores, post office, parks, souvenir shops, laundromat and many more. When you take the bus, an automated announcement will let you know that it is the stop for the hotel. Isn't that great .    4. The WiFi signal is booming ! I was already at the bus stop and still was able to get a signal from the hotel lobby. Although Wifi from Holiday Inn Express across the street and Hawaiian Telecom were good options too    3. We stayed at the 14th floor with the ocean view. The room that we stayed in was clean. The linen, the pillows, the towels in the bathroom and the bathroom itself looked sparklingly clean. The air conditioner was a work horse. it was a searing 95 degree Fahrenheit outside but perfectly cool inside my room. The Television is full packed with on demand cable channels. The shower pressure was okay and switching water temperature from cold to warm was an instant. .    2. The Buffet Breakfast is laden with freshly sliced fruits, salads, juices ( passion / orange / guava fruit juice was awesome ), Hawaiian coffee, breads and hard boiled eggs. They also have this do-it-yourself waffle.    1. And my number 1 reason why you have to stay in this hotel is because of their employees . Specially QILI who always has this great smile when you pass by the lobby in the morning . She was very helpful and very informative to us since it was our first time in the city. We saved a lot of dollars in transportation alone due to her numerous suggestions. She deserve a far more better position in what she's doing . right now. She is smart and always has this warm smile on her face. it was really a pleasure doing business with her.  I also want to mention DARWIN, another fine young fellow. Always polite and was patient in dealing with an irate customer. i wasn't the irate customer but i saw how he handled the matter . Also, very informative and gave us valuable suggestions on how to enjoy the city. A wholesome person in many ways. He works the midnight shift and all works well when he is in charge.  I also want to add CAMMY, the manager who did some magic in moving us from the 9th floor to the 14th floor. Although I made this booking five months in advance. The sales representative assured me that my room is reserved with the ocean view on the 15th floor.  And I wont forget ALTON, the maintenance guy who assisted me when i was fixing some of my stuff .    Reasons why you should skip this hotel and go elsewhere.    1. Sorry, I cannot provide any reason . I will stay in this hotel again for sure. And will spread the news to my friends , to the friends of my friends and to the friends of their friends.    Some minor letdowns :    a) Made this reservation 5 months in advance with a certain Ms Lumantas , hotel sales rep. The deal was, we're supposed to have a room on the 15th floor with a view of the Pacific Ocean, the city, equipped with a kitchenette and breakfast included. On the day of our check-in. They assigned us at the 9th floor where you can hardly see the ocean. Although the city view was fine. Of course I brought this to their attention. Cammy did some adjustments and we were moved to the 14th floor the following dav . This time we had a better view of the ocean and the city view was awesome. The room has no kitchenette , but it is okay since, who cares about the kitchenette when you are there to enjoy the Hawaiian foods outside.    b) The cabinet where the HDTV stands has dust build up. It was very evident !  I think the last time they cleaned this cabinet was when Nixon was still the president of the USA. Shared the matter to the front desk and they fixed the problem.    c) Once, I stayed at the balcony / terrace and i can smell a cigarette smoke. Perhaps somebody is smoking at the other room. I hope they can make this a complete  smoke - free building someday.    Some suggestions:    The security guy who works in the grave yard shift is like a robot, I think his name is hiram. never greet any hotel guests . Never smile , never friendly. Serious type of person. I guess it coincides with the nature of his job. But just to give him a refresher, the hotel guests provide the business, they are the main reason why you have this thing called paycheck. It won't take a lot of effort just to say hello to them.    Laundry room should be open 'til, at least, 10 pm .    At lease once a week , they should include an omelette , bacon, hot dogs and corned beef in their breakfast menu.    This is my honest review , check my photos, i hope Trip Advisor won't delete any of them .

We stayed here for eight days and had a corner room with two Lanai (balcony's). Breakfast was included in the rate and it included hot and cold dishes. Although a good sized dining room, you still needed to be there at the suggested times so as not to have to wait for a table. The hotel is older but is being re-modeled.

I have a tendency to note what is not that good, so you are warned :)    Room:  Pros:  - The room has a good size for 2 people (had a 2 queen beds room)  - The room is clean  - The room is quiet enough to be able to sleep and not always hear your neighbor. You do hear the AC but is an OK background white noise.  - Bed is comfortable, although the pillow could be a little bit more comfy.    Bads:  - The room and the balcony would need a little renovation since part of the balcony were chipping of. The bathroom could also receive a beauty touch up.  - The air conditioning would need a clean up or a to be replaced, since it's shootingcold-ish air but was not really removing humidity. The room was at an ok temperature but could have been colder if humidity was less present.  - They're not many electric plugs in the room (found only 3 that were available)    Staff:  - Everyone was super friendly. You need something, they are all happy to help you with a smile! Big ++  - Front desk almost always have at least 2 persons. You don't wait long for service there.  - I had an issue with my safe not working. I had both the security guy named Miles Smiles and the repair guy named Ramon (I think, I'm not 100% sure) coming the the room and trying to fix it a few minute after raising the problem. Both were super friendly and social!  - I also had a housekeeper named Mhila Talledo. Super friendly and kind. Was taking a few seconds almost each morning to say good morning to everyone on the floor when they would go out. Even though I didn't needed housekeeping, she was always asking me if I needed anything and would give me any supplies I was missing.  - There was also a super nice and beautiful women at the breakfast that was doing the placement of the people. Super friendly and funny in some rush moment.    Services:  - The breakfast buffet is small and have little variety. It greatly miss any kind of meat. Also, the open hours were not big, so if your a late sleeper, you will probably miss it.    Watch out, like some hotels in the US, the are extra fees that are not always shown on reservation site. The were around 20$/night which was for the wifi, breakfast and other stuff.    Overall, I had a really good experience with the staff and the hotel was good quality.

The door getting into the room had a gap of around 2 inches at the bottom that I wasn't impressed about. My biggest gripe was that they had WIFI and I had to go down to the reception every night to get descent coverage.

498053155,30,Not the best,"After a fourteen night stay I have plenty to say about this hotel. The position is ideal as it's a ten minute stroll from the heart of Waikiki. This was my fourth trip to Hawaii & I over it there.    Extra costs    Surprise! Be aware that your the advertised cost of your room is only the beginning. There is also USD $20 Guest Amenity fee charged on a daily basis.    Not only that, you have to pay 4.712 % Sales Tax daily plus Transient Accommodations Tax 9.25% every single day. Beware! This bumps up the price of your accomodation significantly.    Lobby    The lobby area is modern & there are three lifts which make getting up to your room fairly easy. The water dispensers in the lobby are a nice touch.    The room    The beds were comfortable & the air conditioning worked well. The furniture was functional but worn.    The safe did not work at all & despite reporting it to the front desk, nothing was done. Yes, they offered for us to keep our things in the hotel safe but this wasn't exactly convenient. Our room safe should have been repaired that day. Not good enough when you are spending hundreds of dollars per night.    The hotel was built in 1970 & I don't think the bathroom in room 713 has been renovated since. In a nutshell, very basic, tired & worn out.    Pool    The pool was tiny but clean. Not very inviting to sit around with limited room & one area completely sealed off as it's needing repair.    Breakfast    It was back to the 70's with the decor in the breakfast area. The food was fresh & there was plenty of variety. The queues to be seated were often 10-15 minutes long which was very annoying. The worst part was the music they played in the buffet area. It was the same CD every single day and it's really not difficult to mix it up.    Housekeeping    Housekeeping came every day very late in the afternoon around 5pm. They were always polite & friendly but didn't clean things without being explicitly told to do so. I found this staggering- surely you don't need to ask for the bins to be emptied, towels to be replaced & beds to be made? This should be standard! We didn't use the bathtub as it was so filthy because it was rarely cleaned. Our sheets weren't changed after one week of use until we called the front desk twice. Definitely the worst aspect of our stay.    Front Desk    The front desk staff were generally very polite & friendly. Princess is a delight & well suited to her role.    The hotel offers a minibus & driver to different destinations on Oahu 6 days a week. This is a great service & well worth the $10.    We only experienced one problem. My daughter went to the front desk to book a $10 airport shuttle a few days before departure. However, apparently shuttles don't pick up from Waikiki until 8:30am. One would think the person she spoke to at the front desk would have told her that but no. Instead a taxi arrived, at a much more expensive $29 flat rate (excluding state tax). My daughter wasn't told that this fixed rate is only for cash fares so she had to change taxis & pay far more as she needed to pay with a credit card. This drama all happened simply because she wasn't given the correct information! So frustrating.    Overall, we did have an enjoyable stay but the lack of housekeeping & hidden taxes definitely put a dampener on things.    For the money, I think I would try another hotel next time.    - [ ]",Jul 2017,July 2017,Traveled with family,,"Sydney, Australia"

He assisted us with which Tolley to take and the best way to get around.    Now, the room was clean but could use some updating. We did have to call to get the windows and mirrors clean. Christopher came up and was so pleasant and cheerful. He was great. The furniture is very cheaper and worn. The entrance to the bathroom door is small. You will have to turn sideways to get in the door. The bathroom needs upgrading! The sink is very cheaper and the wall of the tub are pilling and cheap. However, the bed slept well! We had two nice baloncy.    The location is perfect! You are 2 minutes away from premium shopping and eating places. It is very active at night and police are everywhere to make you feel safe! The Tolley stops right in from of the hotel, which very convenient.

The bedsheets, the pillows, the furniture and the carpets are worn. The one thing you must watch out for is that they add a $20/night ""amenity"" charge for the privilege of using the room safe and the wifi! It's a nasty surprise and they're being gimmicky with their clients since it's not like they're going to take the safe out of your room (it's bolted down, of course) and the wifi doesn't require a password to get on it.

492632188,20,Very Disappointing,"Before I left I read all the reviews and thought to myself it might not be the best but at least it looks like they are trying and looks like they are taking steps to fix things that aren't great and this is exactly what I found....they are making it look like they are doing things but there is no attention to detail at all.    Firstly they say the rooms have been remodelled but this was done without doing a whole job (or at least in the room I was in). Literally it looks like the room was painted but no preparation done at all under the new paint, the furniture is falling a part, the bottom was falling out of the drawers in the dresser, everything was old and worn out and there was no comfy chair in the room. Also I think this is the only hotel in the world that doesn't have any glassware in it which I guess is ok because the chair on the lanai is not one you'd want to sit on to have a drink in the afternoon anyway.    The biggest joke has to be the amenities fee pretty sure this is a practical joke or the biggest example of a lack of attention to detail. Among other things this fee is supposed to cover, hi speed wifi, bottled water in the room, the coffee for the coffee machine and breakfast. The reason I have mentioned these is because these are where the most attention to detail is lacking. Starting with the wifi, high speed maybe compared to dial up and the fact that it drops in and out because of lack of signal strength makes you so happy to have to pay extra for it. Water to the room great but it is not replenished at all during your stay the coffee on the other hand is although again attention to detail- there are two types and I prefer a dark roast so used this one but it was replaced with the mild roast....great job. Now breakfast it would be ok if there was attention to detail... they tend to just let anyone in and there is not enough chairs and tables, I love having my coffee standing up while waiting for a table or being literally pushed out of the way. The food was passable but really not worth the struggle. All this is fantastic in light of an extra amenities fee that is actually compulsory and added to everyone on arrival.    I have more examples of the poor attention to detail I encountered but All in all to be 100% honest you can do so much better for the money which is very disappointing because underneath there is some promise.    For now my tip look elsewhere.",Jun 2017,June 2017,Traveled on business,,"Mackay, Australia"

491834104,50,"Overall the BEST hotel I've stayed at. Service was impeccable, staff was very accommodating, rooms were clean and HUGE.","My family and I booked a 4-night stay and arrived at the hotel at 10pm at night from a long flight from the east coast. We were all tired but welcomed by the hotel front desk staff Darwin when we checked in. He was very personable, genuine, and patient to me and my family. He explained all the amenities the hotel had to offer. I was very impressed with room. It was clean, very comfortable, and spacious with double- queen beds. We loved the vintage-style appearance of the hotel. It has some history about it too hanging on a plaque inside the lobby. What was cool about the room we had, is that it had a kitchen and a balcony. The balcony was nice to relax and kick back at watching the coconut trees sway in the wind and watching the sunrises and sunsets. The A/C was a split unit therefore it was so quiet, you couldn't hear it. The breakfast buffet was phenomenal. The tasty eggs were real and not powdered, bacon crispy, passion fruit orange juice chilled, and they even had miso soup which was authentic Japanese-tasting. The breakfast staff was quite helpful in getting our family settled at a table which fills up quick. I think it's because the breakfast buffet was quite tasty and affordable. Our breakfast buffet was included with our stay. The hotel was in a perfect location. Stores, restaurants, and the beach were steps away but it was nestled in a quieter part of Kalakaua Avenue away from the hustle and bustle. There are bus stop in front and also close proximity from the hotel. You can catch the pink-line double decker bus in the front. It does a loop around Waikiki and the end stop is at the Ala Moana Center. So, that was very convenient. There was a nice park across the street. It was nice to cut across the quiet, tree-shaded park with the smell of plumeria in the air and walk 5 minutes to Waikiki Beach. What was awesome is that the hotel would loan you Bahama Beach chairs and beach towels. As for parking, Erik was the valet that helped us the most. He was very friendly, down-to-earth guy, and professional. The valet rates is the best-priced parking in all of Waikiki area. The only thing that needs improvement in the hotel was internet wifi. It couldn't connect. As for the bathroom, that needed updating. Oh her than that, all was gravy. During our last day there, Darwin the front desk staff helped checked us out. He is such a nice gentleman, he gave Hawaiian Host chocolates to each of my 3 children. He truly went above and beyond to make our family feel welcomed and comfortable during our stay there. I stay at a variety of chain hotels for work every week and I was truly impressed with the Waikiki Gateway and others cannot compare when it comes to such a personable-accommodating staff.

488851220,30,Very basic hotel with poor wifi connection,"We booked Waikiki Gateway Hotel a few days prior to our arrival. The prices seemed to be comparable to the rest of the hotels in the area. In addition, we fell for Breakfast Included deal hoping to save a bit on breakfast (which was not the greatest plus the same menu every single day) as Hawaii eateries tend to be pricey.    We arrived late at night and got our room assigned. When we went upstairs and opened the door, we found ourselves walking in on other guests sleeping tight in what we initially believed was our room. Well, that was awkward, creepy and quite comical - something that you would think happens only in movies and sitcoms. Basically, we were assigned a wrong room number (1101 instead of 1011), which we received apologies and a free day of parking for.    Speaking of parking and other hotel amenities, valet parking was quite pricey at USD $29/night and resort fee was USD $20/night. So, when you book a hotel room here, make sure to add these costs into your total cost per night.    Our actual room was very basic, but clean. Although, as another person mentioned before me, the corridor that leads from the elevator to the rooms is quite smelly (moldy smell on both 11th and 10th floors) and our room had a strong Clorox smell when we walked in. Even though the hotel claims that the rooms have been recently renovated, they still teleport you to 1980s once you walk in. The AC was working well and was very quiet, we didn't have any issues with it. However, what we had a huge inconvenience with is WiFi.    The hotel claims to have high speed wifi, which was practically non-existent in our room. We could barely connect to it and whenever we succeeded, it was 1998 speed, only without the fancy modem sound. We asked the front desk to reset it a few times, but that did not help. The only place where we were able to get a decent connection and speedy wifi was the business centre on the third floor. It was very inconvenient for us not to be able to connect to wifi, as we had to do some work and respond to e-mails in the morning before heading out for the day. We were told that they are working on replacing/improving WiFi connection. However, if you book this hotel around the date this review is posted, do not expect having good WiFi in your room.    That said, hotel staff provided exceptional service. Everyone was extremely welcoming, nice and helpful. We requested an iron and ironing board to be brought to our room and they sent it within a few minutes. The front desk was very responsive and would call back to check in whether we received the requested items and whether our wifi started working better after they reset it. They were kind enough to lend us a couple of beach towels in our last day after we checked out (which we returned at the end of the day). It seems like the staff is trying to do their very best with what they have.    To be fair there were a few other positive sides to the room and the hotel. The bed mattress was very comfy and we slept like babies through the night. The shower head in the bathtub was my favourite feature of the hotel room, cause it provided strong water pressure, with a wide diameter of water flow (yes, I pay attention to that lol). The bathroom was clean, but had a strong Clorox smell for the first day or so. I'd suggest replacing whatever smelly cleaning supplies the hotel is using with something more hypoallergenic and with no scent. Unpleasant smell can be a huge buzz kill, especially when you are on vacation.    Another positive feature of the hotel is the central location. It's situated close to the international shopping centre and other trendy shops and eateries (if you are into that). It's also located within a pleasant 15-minute walk to the Waikiki beach. I'm sure there are more places to see and things to do around that area, but we focused more on exploring other corners of the island.    In sum, if you are looking for a basic, comparable in price, centrally located hotel, where you are not planning to spent to much time during the day, this is not a bad option to go for. Hopefully, my review was helpful :) Have a great time in Oahu!",May 2017,May 2017,Traveled as a couple,,

Another big shout out to Rouhanne from Reservations. She was patient with our questions... and to Kat from Housekeeping and from Micronesia, very courteous and our room was always neat and clean once we came from our trips.

We did kinda have a big issue but, their great service made us comfortable, we booked a taxi that was supposed to be a $29 flat rate, some how there was a miscommunication and they ended up booking us a reg. taxi, but the taxi man was so amazing, he had us only pay the $29 and he squared the rest away with the hotel.

484861315,40,Lovely stay,"It was our first visit in Oahu, and we could not be happier with our choice of hotel .  My husband and I stayed here for three nights and was very delighted with out time here.  We are light sleepers and honeymooners who were flying in from the other side of the world. So we were very glad that the staff and management went over and beyond to accommodate our request for a quiet room. Since we arrived on a weekday on the latter part of spring (not peak season), they were able to upgrade us to a suite with a wraparound balcony and great view of the ocean and the city. They also greeted us with a box of chocolates.  But even if they did not upgrade our room, we were happy with this hotel. Hawaii is an expensive city to visit, and Waikiki Gateway is reasonably priced. It's a few minutes walk from the busy waikiki beach, but is located along a convenient road.  The bed was comfortable, bathroom is a bit small but very clean. There's coffeemaker in the room too.  Also, I will never forget my first step into the room -- it smelled like sweet pineapples! what a great detail that is fittingly hawaiian.    The only letdown was the breakfast buffet. Selection was not impressive and they make you use disposable plates and cutlery. Though it is still good enough to fill your tummy.    Overall, we still liked our stay and would recommend it to others next time.",May 2017,April 2017,Traveled as a couple,,

484165810,20,Not worth it,"This was probably the worst hotel experience. Stayed here for a night with four friends just until we could book our flight the next day. We're from abroad so none of us had SIM card which means no internet access. The hotel amenities included ""high speed internet connection"" but the big problem was it was not working inside our room. So we had to go all the way to the lobby just so we can book a flight and check emails. Asked the staff about it and they said ""they are working on it"" but it still wasn't working the next day. I know we could easily go to the lounge, but they listed that there would be internet inside the room so it should be available. If we knew this beforehand, we would have booked with a different hotel. In addition, washroom was dirty. They only provided two towels even though they were aware there would be 4 of us (and we had to go down to the lobby ourselves just to get it). This hotel seemed pretentious to me. Only stayed one night and I can't imagine staying longer than that.",May 2017,May 2017,Traveled with friends,,"Brampton, Canada"

The hotel was located conveniently and the room was clean and huge with nice views. Quite a value for the money. The next morning we were quite stressed over a lost item on the airplane we had to replace when the Apple Store opened the next morning and we so blessed with a late checkout. Then Princess at the front desk went way above the call of duty to help me tag our bags for the cruise. And checked us out so graciously as well as gave us tips on the ports we will be seeing.

The bathroom was even worse and we didn't dare use the shower. The pluses of the hotel? The room's a/c worked very well, the breakfast buffet was ample and the staff were eager to assist.

Keurig coffee machine available with 2 pods. Breakfast can be a crowded but there was enough variety in food.    We checked out early, at 10 pm and there seemed to be some confusion over the billing. However, they sorted it out in time for us to catch our taxi to the airport. Other reviews were right in saying that the walls are thin. You can hear the tap or shower of the adjacent room.

Since we weren't going to spend all day inside the hotel I was looking for a clean economical place. Waikiki Gateway had wonderful reviews and everyone mentioned how the staff was warm and friendly. The room was bright and clean. Beds and pillows were very comfortable. I have stayed in numerous midrange priced hotels and these beds were top notch. Little things also like the shower head and water pressure were just right. The AC actually had a remote control. That was a first.    Now the people. As soon as we arrived we were welcomed with smiles and Alohas! In fact every time we walked into the lobby someone behind the counter was saying Aloha!    I really looked forward to coming downstairs and seeing Princess or Cammy behind the counter. They were so nice. I even got a hug from Princess before I left. The porter Miles was outstanding. Made sure we were comfortable in our room. He even gave us a tour guide and recommended a place to eat. My daughter was especially impressed with his service. One more notable individual was Erik the valet. Always a smile and welcome back. We did have a running joke about where the car keys were. He had to run me down a couple times. Darn keyless start!    One more thing. The hotel is at the northern end of Waikiki. It is in between two of the main streets so it is away from all the heavy traffic.

Some of the reviews we had read about the breakfast were poor, so you can imagine how surprised I was to realize I am not a hotel snob, I loved the breakfast buffet included in our price, every morning we had choices of scrambled eggs, sausage or bacon, cereal, yogurts,bagels, bread,cakes, fresh fruit, coffee,juice,misu soup, rice,hash browns etc. All fresh and all very tasty and the staff were so very pleasant, one man was always singing to himself and very helpful and friendly.  The hotel room was remodelled recently and was nicely done, spacious, large tv ,clean with a very enjoyable view , the hotel is built on a junction where the road splits in 2 and we loved our view of the city lights and people tooing and froing to the beach, I never went to the swimming pool, my wife did and said it wasnt very big, but who needs a pool with that amazing beach about 5 minutes walk through a nice park.  Has its own ABC store on ground level, towels for the beach included,and the receptionists were excellent nothing was a bother to them,but especially Cammy ( I think her real name is Ivy) she was so friendly helpful and showed an interest in our family which she probably does to everyone ,but we did feel special, there is also a really nice guy that helps with bags, elevator,towels looks like he Could be from a fast and furious movie a gentle Giant .

We asked to be moved and got a great balcony with proper padded lounge chairs, so evenings relaxing on the balcony were awesome. The staff are great, lovely people. The breakfast is not quite your ""buffet of hot food"" most days its scrambled eggs and some skinless sausage like things, but its fine. Once day we were there, there was bacon - yay! There is a convenience store right on the corner which is great. The tourist buses stop right outside and you are really handy for all the high end shops and great restaurants nearby.

I requested the room be sprayed and asked for bug spray (the hotel can not give out big spray and I had to fend off the bugs myself. I recommend BYO bug spray). These requests were not acted on. Finally I emailed a complaint with pictures to the hotel. An exterminator was brought in the day before my check out while I inhabited the room. The morning of check out I had the awful experience (after my shower) of feeling the crunch underfoot of treading on one of the many cockroaches that were dead in the floor.

Immediately upon my arrival we were greeted with warmth, love and aloha from the front desk staff and security. We upgraded to a Sky Penthouse for great price and it was beautiful! The beds were comfy. Definitely one of the best nights of sleep I've had in a long time. The room was clean and spotless.    Every time we passed an employee, we were greeted, and it felt genuine. Everyone is friendly, professional, and personable (I love this the most. It made me feel important and like they truly cared about me).

Bathroom needs remodeling. Wifi weak and cuts out. Noise comes through but not much. Just the sound of sirens otherwise not local traffic. Great location being at the entrance of the waikiki strip.

464535748,40,Great workers,"Staying with Waikiki Gateway Hotel was such a great experience that it made me realize that what I thought before about employees just working to make a living nowadays , never taking anymore into account the comfort of their guests/ customers no longer exists. I was by far so wrong, with this hotel all of the staff was so accommodating that the experience over all made me want to stay here again on my next visit to Ohau Island. From the front desk workers, Kai, Princess and Brian to the valet attendant Erik and housekeeping staff that everyday of the 8 days we stayed accommodated our requests. Thanks most specially to Princess and Erik who deserves every credits/praise for the friendly and caring atmosphere they create with all the guests.

We went out to get some food and Kai cheerfully pointed us in the right direction. The location is really fantastic. It was just a short walk to all types of shopping and restaurants.

460929016,50,Great stay great staff,"I can't say enough about how great the staff was before and during our stay. We needed to change the days we had originally planned to stay... I contacted trip advisor to make this modification to our plans and for them to make the change they had to cancel out the whole reservation and start over. That's all well and good but I had booked it quite some time ago and had a great rate. With trip advisor cancelling and rebooking they were giving me the current rate which was $20 plus more a night which was obviously not ok! I tried to work with them to remedy the problem and it was impossible for them to be helpful. I called the hotel direct and they were more than happy to reserve the room at the rate that I originally had for the days that I needed. They were so helpful and accommodating. Then upon arrival all staff was very kind and helpful to any need we had. Our room was very clean and had been recently remodeled. The hotel is a very short walk from the beach and has anything you need there or close by. We stayed 2 nights then checked out and came back for our last night in Hawaii. When we returned the staff was even better and they were already great. As a returning guest they had upgraded everything for us.... our room had a better view, they left us Hawaiian chocolates on the bed. Upgraded shampoos... etc. We will definitely stay at this hotel again.",Feb 2017,February 2017,Traveled with family,,
460723279,30,Amazing Friendly Staff,"My family and I stayed a week at the Waikiki Gateway Hotel recently. The three of us could not fault the staff in any way. Friendly, helpful, happy, nothing was too much of a bother from ordering a taxi for us, to setting up two wake-up calls in the morning. Breakfast was okay, but not much of a variety if you are staying a few days.Same fruit every day. Whilst we were having breakfast there were a couple of brooms in the setting-up area in the room. I don't think these brooms should have been there - not a good look whilst you are eating. We were placed on the four in an apparent ""deluxe room"". Judging by other photographs of deluxe rooms on the web, I think we were not given a room that was deluxe. We were all totally disappointed, when we compared with other photographs of previous guests. We were placed in a corner room, which isn't too bad, we had two verandahs to sit on and admire the views. The room needs to be insulated, as being on Floor 4, we heard all of the traffic from early in the morning until about midnight, when either the traffic died down, or we fell asleep. When we first arrived we exited the lift on Floor 4 and all we could smell was paint, as they were renovating. A few of the lights didn't work in the room, along with the kettle (hot pot). Also the shower curtain rod fell down whilst we were there in the bathroom. Overall, it is a fantastic position. Walking distance to the beach, and the main strip of Waikiki, but far enough away so there wasn't any hustle and bustle from foot traffic. The Pink Line bus pulls our right at the front, and it costs $2.00 for a day pass. Well worth it.. The Gateway supplies bottles of water in the room, but only on the first day. They do have a water supply on hand, near the main foyer, if you wish to top your water bottle up each day. Over all, I would call our stay in the Gateway Hotel average. The room was clean, the staff the best I've encountered, but the other negatives that happened whilst we were there to do with the room, I think I would pay a few extra $'s and stay elsewhere if I returned.",Feb 2017,February 2017,Traveled with family,"Maybe ask for a room on a high floor, and ask for a photograph of the room they are actually...","Townsville, Australia"

Not eco friendly, you will have to switch off every usage of electricity manually when you leave the room. Swimming pool was closed due to some repaire work. Couldn't find the gym. The shower tap was leaking water resulting in a wet floor after every shower.    But ...  Stayed here in total 2+5 nights of our 19 days during Hawaii trip. Slept on the 14th floor with 2 balconies. One facing the ocean and other facing the busy main street of Waikiki. The views were amazing and by day it will give much natural light in the room.

458216659,50,Amazing Guest Experience,"I haven never been to Hawaii and my first experience I had was at the Waikiki Gateway Hotel. As soon as we got to the hotel we were greeted with excitement and warmth. We were checked into the Waikiki Gateway by a little Miss Princess K. Tabernero. Princess and her fellow staff members were very accommodating. We were given a map as well as a list of things to do that were recommended by the staff there at the Waikiki Gateway Hotel. If you have never been to the island before and would like to learn how to pronounce a few words go ahead and have the front desk folks help you out, it definitely makes for a good laugh. I was even given a birthday card and some amazing candies...I'm telling you, no joke, this was an amazing experience. The Room was newly renovated, the AC worked great when needed, and we even had a little balcony to ourselves. Whenever we realized we forgot anything, whether it be snacks or beverages, there was a little ABC store connected to the hotel. We were within a few blocks of everything we wanted, Beach, Restaurants, Bars, Shopping, and much more. I really cannot say enough about this place and the next time I stay in the Waikiki Area I will definitely be staying here. I wish I could remember all of the staff members names to thank them all but, I would like to once again say thank you to Princess K. Tabernero and Roger!
