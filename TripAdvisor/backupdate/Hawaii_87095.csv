862242080,50,"Clean, chic, safe","Originally was in a room that shared a wall with the elevator shaft (1014). They were able to move me in the middle of my 5 night stay to a different room that was amazing (1811). Clean rooms, comfortable beds, helpful staff, fun/chic lobby area, and one block from the beach! Pool area and restaurant overlook Diamond Head, which is awesome, however I was very disappointed that the (free) yoga classes that are typically done out by the pool (overlooking Diamond Head) were moved to the fitness room while I was there. They said it was for an event, however I never saw an event going on? I was disappointed about the yoga but they waived my resort fee to compensate and I ended up doing my own yoga on my balcony.    They also offer complementary hula classes and lei making classes. They have a station in the lobby to refill water bottles, a coffee shop, and a couple other shops. I would stay here again/recommend to others.",Sep 2022,September 2022,,Room 1811 was awesome! Amazing view of Diamond Head and partial ocean view. Balcony.,
861558025,30,Would be 5 stars if…,"If it wasn’t for my check in experience I would give this hotel five stars. Weeks before the trip I booked a mountain/beach side view for about $380. The only reason I picked this room over a city view room (which was much cheaper, over 100$ less) was because I wanted the view. When I checked in they said they were out of the specific room with the view I paid for weeks before. I’m typically not one to complain but I booked weeks in advance and specifically paid extra for the view. They did attempt to upgrade me to a penthouse with Cityview but I don’t care about the penthouse I just wanted the specific view I paid for. I did not feel it was appropriate to not have the room available that I paid for weeks ago. This was unacceptable. After I told her at check in that that was the only reason that I got the room and that I did not want a city view she suddenly had a penthouse with a mountain/beach view available. I was really glad that they upgraded me to a penthouse with a mountain/beach view. This made everything okay for us. The penthouse was beautiful and clean and in a perfect location for walking around Honolulu and shopping and going to the beach. The view was amazing with windows on both sides of the room. The pool is not as good in person with cheap grass but looks good in photos. I really love the decor that they have around the motel it looks very cool. So like I said I would definitely give this hotel five stars if it had not been for the issue at check-in. I probably won’t stay there again for fear that this would happen again, but if it does not happen to you it would be a great place to stay.",Sep 2022,September 2022,Traveled as a couple,They may sell out of the room you paid for weeks in advance.,"Pineville, Kentucky"
861442518,50,A Queen’s Delight,"This visit to Oahu was for a dear friend’s son’s wedding. Having not been to Oahu in 50 years (seriously, it was my high school grad gift!) and now returning for a very special occasion I wanted to have a good experience. The groom and bride selected this hotel and it was the perfect location for the many nearby scheduled events for the bridal party’s  guests. Itzia in Sales/Mktg.  did an excellent job helping me with my resy and making sure I got the view of Diamond Head I wanted. The room was shared with a family member and we both were very comfortable with its size and design. And the beds & pillows were perfect.  Couldn’t have had a more lovely experience.

861428988,50,This couldn’t wait until we arrived …..,"Aloha!    I will start by saying this trip was not the trip we wanted to make given our friend and family has experienced a death -which will bring us all out in support.    That said, there were a couple hiccups upon booking. I frantically made these errors, in what was for sure anxiety and haste.    While my initial call with someone in reservations ( we’ll leave unnamed) I was insensitively alarmed by the lack of service or regard. It was swiftly turned around by Jolynn!    I can see why she was given the title of Manager!    She was understanding and accommodating. Though, the errors were not made by her team, she understood the dilemma. She compassionately listened and made the amends she was able to make within her means, while keeping in mind the narrative around the trip.    We’ll arrive in October, she’s made sure to provide us with the best experience possible!    Her team member, Jessica has mirrored that ethos! She’s as sweet as Hawaiian cake!    We have three families who will be staying and while this wasn’t my choice in hotel upon booking ( my cousin selected) it will surely be one of my go to spots! I plan on recommending the property to many as these details are what make traveling pleasant and memorable.    We look forward to arriving and having an amazing time, again!

861132932,50,Amazing,"Well we loved our 2 days here, for some unknown but fortuitous reason we got upgraded to an ocean view room, we had a corner room and it was just the most fantastic view I think I've ever had from a hotel (stayed in a lot!). Right over the beautiful beach as well as the city from the second aspect. Really cool hotel with excellent location a block from the beach. Staff are all brill. They offer beach chairs with no cost but you have to pay to store luggage on check out which is odd and was my only negative point. Right at end of beach so not in thick of it but still plenty within walking distance. Pool is fairly small but lovely area surrounding and the size doesn't matter with the beach right there. Tip- do pool in morning as sun goes off late pm.",Sep 2022,September 2022,Traveled as a couple,Pool is better in morning if you like the sun.

860478143,50,Group Stay for Wedding,We set up a room block for our wedding and Queen Kapiolani ended up being the best hotel for our guests. It was a terrific experience working with the staff - very friendly and prompt responses to any and all questions.

859620111,50,Amazing along-Term Stay! (PCS),"Our stay at Queen Kapiolani has been amazing! We have been staying at the hotel since August 1, and will be ""moving out"" next Friday, the 16 of September. It’s a very long time to be at a hotel, but they have been so accommodating. While it’s not home, they recognize us and treat us like family in every department.    Room: We are staying in a city view room with two beds. I would say the room is average size. I knew what it was going to look like based on other reviews, and wanted to be extra organized due to the length of our stay. So, I packed collapsible baskets, a couple plastic drawers, and bags to keep our clothes in while they are in the closet shelves. Our totes stack nicely in the closet area and we are able to use it as a shelf for our swimsuits and extra stuff. The bathroom has a nice open area under the sink where I put more baskets for all our toiletry items. We pushed one of the beds against the wall to help prevent our youngest from falling off and it was easy to move and made extra walking space between the beds. My favorite part is the balcony with view of the city at night.    Housekeeping: All the employees that we have been in contact with, and there have been a lot, have been so helpful and attentive. We have housekeeping clean our room a few times a week (it can be done daily, but we don't need it cleaned that often), and they do a great job. Our room is always ready for us when we get back to the hotel. If you have pets, I believe you have to call in advance to schedule a cleaning.    Valet: The guys at valet are our favorite! They are always so nice and greet us and our kids with a smile every time we see them. Before coming we weren't sure how it was going to work having valet service every time we need our car, but it has been really great not having to worry about finding a parking spot and dealing with tight parking garage spaces. We tip a few bucks each time we arrive and leave, and they seem very grateful for it. It can get backed up in the mornings when soldiers and their families are leaving, but we plan ahead and go downstairs a little before we have to leave in case it takes a little while.    Food/Drinks: The restaurant at the hotel, Deck, is very good! They have daily mixed drink specials and happy hour. The pool is right by the restaurant, so if you don't want to eat there, you can eat at the pool or get it delivered to your room. You can also enjoy a nice dinner while your kids swim, provided they are good swimmers. There are no lifeguards on duty. The coffee shop downstairs has really good coffee. It can be pricey, but they have a monthly membership that includes one cup of coffee/day. It pays itself off in a little over a week, which was worth it because I drink coffee like water. If you get it often enough, they might even remember your coffee order and have it ready for you like they do mine. :) The hotel room comes with a small refrigerator and a microwave on request. We got a microwave the day we got there and it has been really nice to heat up leftovers or make easy meals.    Location: One last plus is the location. I believe it's a block from the beach, and that has been really great for us because we have two kids that love the water. The zoo is across the street and the aquarium is within walking distance as well.    We have really enjoyed our stay at the hotel and it has made us feel like we have been on vacation since we have moved here! I definitely recommend QK for your next vacation, or if you’re heading to Hawaii for your next Duty Station!",Sep 2022,August 2022,Traveled with family,,"Honolulu, Hawaii"

859116114,20,Family trip cost MUCH more than expected once we got there. Pool tiny and room amenities slim.,"Negatives: We booked our trip through a travel agent after seeing the Summer Deals on the website. Half off valet, 4th night free and half off resort fees. Booked the 5-day stay and there was no info about resort fees (as they typically do) and it states the valet was $45. The only discount they gave us was the 4th night free. Got there...resort fees were $230 per room ( booked 2 rooms) AND the valet was $50 PLUS tax. Website says 24 hours/per valet charge. We stayed less than 100 hours and were charged for 120 hours...so the website should say ""Per Day"", not per 24 hours. This visit cost us an additional $700+ for 2 rooms/1 car for 4.5 days, over and above the room cost. The front desk stood firm and said we have to get the resort fees from the agent (ugh!) I even have AAA, wouldn't give the discount. BTW: NO COFFEE MAKER, NO MICROWAVE, No dresser, and barely enough room to get past the beds to the bathroom. There isn't even a closet, just 4 shelves and a half of a bar to hang clothes (see attached picture). The Pool is TINY and only about 6 lounge chairs were there. Positives: 3 blocks from beach, across the street from zoo and friendly housekeeping staff and valet staff. Borrowed beach chairs (see picture) and towels and were able to take all over the island.",Sep 2022,September 2022,Traveled with family,,

There are no amenities in this hotel like coffee in your room. The restaurant in the hotel Decks always turned us away because we had no reservations. Restaurant was always empty so made no sense.

We had to meet friends and gave ourselves 30mins for a 20min walk. However the elevator took, 17mins, and I was only able to get on when someone who was already on was willing to get off and take the stairs.    Besides being a safely issue we had to alter our transportation plans for that evening.

852027676,40,Great View!,"We had a mountain view junior suite on the 17th floor which is surrounded by windows. Although we had a great view of Diamond Head, the zoo, and Kapiolani Park, you can also see the ocean as well.  Facing Diamond Head, you also have a great city/suburb view as well to the left. The beds were comfortable, and there were no issues with the room. The only issue was that there was one elevator out of the three that was not working which caused a longer wait during peak periods.

851953398,40,Close to the Beach,"Since we went to Hawaii to attend a wedding, we didn't choose this hotel ourselves. What my husband and I loved about the hotel was the perfect location to the beach and our unobstructed view of the ocean from our balcony. We were not impressed with the lack of parking. We had to pay to park across the street, and annoyingly we kept having to update the time on the meter. We were surprised that we didn't have a coffee maker in the room, and the hotel didn't offer free coffee in the lobby. Instead, we had to pay $12.00 for two coffees at the lobby story. Our room was adjacent to the elevators, so my sleep was disrupted by the loud rumblings of the elevators. The Deck Restaurant and the pool are nice features. Overall, we had a comfortable clean room with a refrigerator but without other frills. Knowing how expensive Hawaii is, we probably couldn't get much better elsewhere.for the same price.",Aug 2022,July 2022,,,"Hicksville, New York"
851191093,30,Not for families.,"If you are looking to come to Waikiki with family and rent a car, this hotel is not for you. They have extremely limited valet spots for guests, no waitlist to get a spot and give very poor instructions on where and how to park. The instructions they do give to park are also always full. You are basically on your own. Expect to park a mile or more away.    We were never able to get a spot at the hotel valet because they expect you to be at their desks in a certain time frame in the morning. Maybe show some care for your customers by doing some basic hospitality management and create a wait list.    The restaurant on the 3rd floor was not a place we wanted to have a dinner. Within 5 minutes of waiting up there both my wife and I had headaches from the searing volume of the live music.    It seems to me this hotel relies solely on location and does the bare minimum to maintain the hotel rather than think about how they could improve guest experiences.",Jul 2022,August 2022,Traveled with family,Parking is non existent for all intents and purposes.,

850914187,40,Great hotel near Waikiki Beach,"My family recently stayed at the Queen Kapiolani Hotel (twice!) while visiting Hawaii. Both stays were great, and I highly recommend staying at the Queen Kapiolani if you're looking for a hotel in the Waikiki area.  The hotel is located near the east end of Waikiki, near Queen's Beach. The location is perfect, because it's only a one-block walk to the beach, but the area is still a bit quieter than the middle of the craziness of Waikiki. We really enjoyed the purified water dispenser in the lobby, as well as the free lei-making class that the hotel offers.  The best thing about the hotel, however, is the staff. Everyone that we encountered at the hotel was friendly and helpful. When we arrived at the hotel a bit early after a long flight from Australia, the woman that worked at reception was kind enough to give us a room about 1.5 hours before the official check-in time of 3 PM.  The only complaints that I have would be related to the parking and the elevators. There were no parking spots available at the hotel while we were there, so we had to park across the street in the zoo parking lot. The zoo parking is really close to the hotel (maybe more convenient than the hotel's valet parking) and a bit cheaper than the hotel parking, but you have to use your cell phone to pay for additional time after 4 hours, and it isn't always fun to stay up waiting for the text when you've just gotten off of a long flight. Perhaps the hotel could allow people making reservations to reserve a parking spot in advance. Also, there are only 3 elevators in the lobby, which means that you'll wait a bit for an elevator during busy times (there are about 20 floors, with around 15 to 20 rooms on each floor). To be fair, there's not much that management can do about either of these issues at this point, and the inconveniences were minor compared to what we've experienced at many other hotels.  All in all, the Queen Kapiolani Hotel is a perfect place to stay near Waikiki, and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.",Jul 2022,July 2022,,,Texas

848460394,40,Great location and friendly staff,"My family of 3 booked this hotel based on a recommendation from my wife's aunt. The location is fabulous if you want to be in Waikiki with walking distance to the beach - which was our main premise. Check in was easy and we received a complimentary update to a penthouse room with 270 deg views of Diamondhead and Waikiki beach - simply awesome!  The staff was always friendly, the bell desk was super helpful - you can get towels and beach chairs there and we even could borrow a floaty for some beach fun that someone else left behind.  Parking at the hotel valet was not a possibility for us, they had no space on any of the three days that we were there. We did get to park across the street in the parking lot that's adjacent to the Honolulu zoo; it's convenient enough except that you need to pay for at least 1 hour and max is 4 hours. If you leave your cell phone number at the meter, they text you with options for extensions (up to 900 mins) - when you get home at 11 at night and want to go to bed, it's not as fun to stay up for at least 45 mins to renew your parking. Our kid did not enjoy the pull-out bed the first night, the other 2 nights he slept on the sofa (without pull-out) and that worked well. The shower in the master had relatively low water pressure. The swimming pool area is fabulous and great for kids with turf around the sides of the pool so running and jumping is safer (and adults can relax poolside - they let you get beverages from the bar from The Deck - the restaurant that's right next to the pool on that level).  If you plan to shop extensively, this hotel is on the wrong end of Waikiki.",Jul 2022,July 2022,,,"Portland, Oregon"

847735351,40,Terrific location and quality food and vendors,"We stayed a few days at the tail end of our trip and what a pleasant surprise! The hotel feels like it was recently renovated...and clearly they did a really nice job. The room that we had, while not overly large, did have a terrific balcony with a view of Diamondhead, high above the pool area. The design of the room was cool, they made a little alcove near the front door with some shelves and the hangars, so it feels like you have a section for all your travel stuff away from where you want to hang out. A small touch, but a good design, taking advantage of what is usually a dead space.    The restaurant was good--and their cocktail program was on point, a welcome departure from the samey drinks you find in the area. While I didn't get a chance to get coffee there, the cafe section was nice and the gallery store is well curated and had some great pieces by local artists, well worth your time.    The staff was super friendly throughout, and they lend you towels and chairs for free to take with you to the beach, which is really just a few blocks away.    We spent most of our day time at the beach but the pool area looked nice enough--the turf looks cool and is hopefully cool on the feet. I did not see that many umbrellas and it certainly looked like they could have used them. Like many of the pools in the area, this one seemed to be mostly for families and their kids, the social scene was really at the bar, which also had great views.    The gym area is pretty nice--high ceilings, which is not the norm for hotel gyms!--and they had a really great purified water dispenser you could use to fill your complimentary water bottles, which was a nice touch.    All in all, we had a great time at the hotel. It is a nice building and the area makes it easy to explore Waikiki beach on one side and a quick ride to Kaimana Beach down the road.    I think 2-3 nights would be the perfect amount of time here.",Jul 2022,June 2022,,,"Los Angeles, California"

The room was so small we barely had enough room to unpack. We reported the issues with the cracks, loose plumbing, and mold. The front desk said they would pass the information along so it could be fixed. They said they would switch us to a comparable room, but we had to spend three nights in the tiny room. We had to pack all of our belongings up, chech out, have them store our belongings, and be without a room from 11 a.m. until 3 :55 p.m. They said they would call us as soon as the room was ready, after waiting until after 3:30 we had to call them and sure enough the was ready and they forgot to call us. We had to check in again, and the comparable room had a king size bed and full size tub. They said they would charge us for the tiny room at the rate for the room with a king size bed. We also wanted to verify that the issues with the tiny room were reported, and the front desk asked why we didn't reported, we told her that we did. She said that the Queen Kapiolani was an old hotel and that was the reason for the bathroom and mold issues. This hotel has remolded in the last few years. Unfortunately, we prepaid for our hotel stay, and had 11 more nights reserved or we would have gone somewhere else.",Jul 2022,July 2022,Traveled as a couple,,Washington
847421965,50,"Cute hotel, friendly staff","We stayed here on the last night of our Hawaiian vacation (we did the Hilton Hawaiian Village at the beginning, then went to the Big Island, then returned to Oahu for one more night). It is a cute, boutique-feel hotel. The decor is fun and there are lots of places to sit and relax (lobby, second floor open area with seating clusters and charging tables, third floor restaurant/pool/lounge). Staff were great.    Our room was okay. We just choose a 2 queen city view room. It is a little older of a place, but the decor was fresh and modern.    After check-out, we checked our luggage with the bell hop for $2/piece and came back later. Lots of people do this and it was convenient for a late flight.    The Deck restaurant was great and I’ll do a separate review for that.    My only suggestion for improvement comes from the fact that the main lobby restrooms require a room key. We turned ours in at checkout, so had to go to the restrooms by the pool when we were back hanging out after lunch and before our flight. I wish they had told me to hang on to the room key for the day for this reason (assuming it would still work).",Jul 2022,July 2022,Traveled with family,,"Chambersburg, Pennsylvania"

846714208,50,Attentive Care and Support,"We had a wonderful experience working with the Queen Kapiolani staff on our wedding hotel blocks, event reservations at the Deck, and during our stay with them during our wedding week. When we were looking into room blocks at different hotels, Queen Kapiolani stood out to us because of its convenient location (right by the beach, Honolulu Zoo, gorgeous view of Diamond Head, walking distance towards malls/shops), amenities (inside hotel and beach equipment provided), dining options (cafe/restaurant/bar), and reasonable pricing. The hotel has been recently remodeled – the gym was heavily equipped and spacious, and its restaurant (The Deck) has sweeping beach and Diamond Head views making it a great location for group dinners/reservations. My husband liked it so much we ended up doing some coordinated happy hour events with friends and he did his Groomsmen luncheon there on our wedding Day. Julia and Itzia (who we worked closely with on room-blocks) were incredibly responsive and attentive to the care of our guests. They swiftly helped modify any reservations and were communicative with us throughout the entire process. Upon arriving at our hotel room, we were greeted with a Welcome bag filled with local island treats and a small bottle of champagne with a sweet card congratulating us on our upcoming nuptials. We were given a breathtakingly beautiful view of the beach and Diamond Head. The staff at Queen Kapiolani was incredibly friendly, helpful, and kind to us and our guests.

846451221,40,Hawaiian paradise,"Aloha we stayed in room 1807 with a city view with balcony, the balcony was large enough for small table and two chairs, we had two queen beds, air conditioning, iron, safe .housekeeping was excellent and overall I loved the hotel. we were situated across from Honolulu zoo and two blocks from the beach. The hotel was ideally situated to the main centre but quiet enough to avoid the hustle/bustle 15 minutes’ walk to main Waikiki centre. the hotel had a coffee shop but it closed at 4pm every day which I found a bit strange but Starbucks was 5 minutes’ walk. the only negative about all Waikiki hotels are the pool size which only have 20 chairs around the pool, they do provide beach chairs to carry to the beach on a first come basis. please be aware Hawaii is an island and eating can be expensive",Jul 2022,July 2022,,,"Accrington, United Kingdom"
846359232,40,"Nice hotel, but missing a few simple things.","The hotel is conveniently located in Waikiki a block off the beach and across the street from the zoo. A couple ABC Stores are close by, too. We had a great lunch at Deck other than the prices, but that's Hawaii.  The hotel is pretty nice on the inside, but the lobby is open air to the street. Not a big deal as that seems to be common in Hawaii, but pretty sure there were folks that weren't staying there hanging out and even bringing their meals into the lobby.  A few shortcomings:  1) Valet parking is the only option at the hotel for... $50/day!! It was full when we got there, but that actually worked out better. We parked in the public low across the street at the zoo and paid by the hour what would equate to $36/day. It was easier in/out than valet.  2) No coffee maker in the room. What hotel doesn't have a coffee maker in the rooms? Your options are the shop in the lobby or Starbucks down the street.  3) No ice machines other than one at the bellhop stand in the lobby. What hotel doesn't have ice machines on every floor? I guess ones that don't have coffee makers in the room.",Jul 2022,June 2022,,,Houston
846294436,40,Review,"The only negative experience with this hotel was that I booked 2 rooms both were ""Studio Ocean View "". However one room was literally twice the size of the other. The smaller of the 2 rooms had a queen bed that was against the wall eliminating the ability of a person to get in and out unless they were to ""crawl"" out of the bed and this was not an option due to the occupants in that room were disable. The other issue was lack of automobile parking. They have limited space to accommodate their guest ..if you don't get there early enough you'll have to park on the street or a parking lot about a half a mile away. To both of these issue .. they were addressed the next day",Jul 2022,June 2022,,,

The staff on the hotel booking side (Itzia!!) and on the event planning side (Kotomi) were WORLD CLASS! They bent over backwards to make this the best experience we could have had. We had to reschedule no less than 3 times because of Covid and they were gracious and accommodating each time. The event space overlooks Diamond Head and is just phenomenal as were the food and beverage at the adjacent restaurant. If we come back to Hawaii, we will stay here because of all the personal touches. It is not often I stay at a hotel that is not Hilton, but I think being independent allowed them to really be flexible and provide a great experience. The hotel has been redone to include a very on-trend decor. I also really appreciated having the beach chairs to check out daily. I had a car and they were great at getting the cars out quickly and safely.

844109986,30,Not quite excellent.,"My rate included free parking, and there was no parking available on the property. I parked in a public lot across the street and received a generous credit.    The lobby was often bustling, and it took me a half hour to check in at 3 PM on a Saturday.    The room was comfortable and nicely furnished, although it had no closet, no desk and no coffee maker. It did have a space where clothes could be hung. It had a lovely view of Diamond Head and the beach.    The terrace was small and dominated by air conditioning equipment — both sonically and visually, but the view was great. The property’s exterior could use a paint job — and looks tired.    The pool is small, and the pool area is covered in artificial turf. The pool area needs a refresh.    While the service staff was friendly in the restaurant and front desk, the food was expensive and not carefully prepared. For example, the yokes of the poached eggs in my breakfast were solid.    The sixties posters in the public spaces were charming. The custom toiletries are a nice touch.

843944226,40,Bad Hotel Parking Process,"Great staff and employees!!! My only problem, their parking lot filled up and they sent me away to find parking someplace else in Waikiki. I found one two blocks away. This was totally unacceptable. You'd think they would've come up with another process where they wouldn't inconvenience their guests. Maybe have an option where guests can reserve parking ahead of time such as when you are making reservations and if it shows full for that day, have valet runners take your car to another parking garage. At a minimum, hotel should send a text notifying a guest that the parking lot is full and to use another parking location and provide recommended locations.  The hotel did upgrade my room and they did pay for my parking bill which I appreicated. Still, this should be an easy fix for them. Luckily, I live in Hawaii and I'm a little familiar with Waikiki. Good luck to those who will be arriving from another state or country...they may get lost and I'm pretty sure they will get frustrated as I did.",Jun 2022,June 2022,,,

842182297,50,One of the best places to stay for value.,The Queen Kapiolani hotel is a great place to stay. Location is almost unbeatable. The staff all around are great and welcoming.    My only complaint is the balcony’s on some rooms could use a touch up. I spent little to no time on mine but for those who do I’m sure they’d like a better and cleaner set up.

841632814,30,Needs an update,"The location and view are spot on. Otherwise this is an average hotel that needs an update. All of the furnishings are worn and paint is chipped. Pretty disappointing for paying the extra to treat my family to the penthouse suite for our first vacation since Covid hit in 2019. The description of the suite boasts about the large lania. However, when sitting on the lanai you can’t enjoy the view because the wall built around the balcony blocks the view! That same wall also blocks the view of one of the windows. The bedroom window faces straight into the lania and room of the neighbor. Poor design and planning on that one. If you like white noise while you sleep, then your going to love the jet engine volume of the air conditioner. Otherwise I recommend a good pair of ear plugs. Also, if you plan on renting a care you will need to plan on parking it somewhere other than the hotel. They only offer Valet parking at $50 per day. Keep in mind the garage is small and fills up quickly. On the day we arrived it was full and they recommended that we try one of the other hotels down the street, or street parking, or the public zoo parking lot across the street. That was kind of a bummer to drive around looking for parking. If I knew in advance I would have planned for it. Word of advice is to skip this place and stay at the Park Shore instead.

I would recommend avoiding rooms on the 3rd floor since the Pool and Deck is on that level. So it can be kind of noisy during the daytime and evenings, but the volume dies down (thankfully) around 900 pm.    Front desk workers were friendly, responsive and efficient.

We thought it would be a cute Hawaiian boutique hotel based on the photos and tried to choose a place we couldn’t stay at anywhere else. Unfortunately the pictures were misleading. Our room was underwhelming and dirty. After finding bright yellow stains on the comforter and brown stains on the toilet seat we immediately canceled our second night there and stayed at a much more well-known brand name hotel for the same price and had a much better experience.    I did give it two stars because if it hadn’t been for the stained bed and toilet, we probably would have stayed. The ocean view was lovely, the coffee shop downstairs was quick and had great craft coffee, and the location of the hotel was on the Main Street along Waikiki beach but at the end away from the noise. The noise that we could hear from inside the hotel though certainly made up for it. We found a sleep machine app on our phones in order to be able to drown out the noise and get some sleep.

Incredible! We sat on the balcony every morning and night. The zoo is directly across the street and you will hear animal noises though-out the night and early morning. We loved it, the birds and monkeys greeting us each morning. Even if you don't stay here, but I strongly suggest you do, be sure to have a meal at the Deck. Amazing French toast and Tokyo pancakes.",May 2022,June 2021,,,
836827138,40,A good Stay,"We were happy with our room and stay. Bed was comfortable and I have a 5k bed at home thats not as comfortable! We had a ocean view king room, the view was mostly of Diamond head but it was nice, better than buildings or alley. if you actually want the ""ocean"" say Beach Front"" but I was happy with what we had. We didn't have any noise issues. Had a safe, Iron and blow dryer in room. Bathroom was fine, shower pressure was good, did have fluctuation in water temp at times but I was fine, Tub we had could be updated had a few chips (which was funny cause I thought it looked like the Hawaiian islands) Had a fridge if you need. I suppose the only issue was Ice machines, we had a hard time getting one that was in use, ended up using the one by the valet, So I would just get Ice when you go up and your fine. Didn't have much interactions with the Staff, they weren't unfriendly or over friendly other than when we left we delt with an older guy in valet he was very helpful and nice. We only ate at the ""Deck"" for breakfast and it was good each time. Coffee shop was fine went a few times. It was only a brief walk to the beach. It was a nice stay and we were happy.",May 2022,April 2022,,,

836198199,50,A Warm and Welcoming Stay,"When I used to live in Hawai'i, I often visited Knots coffeeshop and wondered what it would be like to stay there. A few years later, visiting with my partner and baby, we were thoroughly pleased with our stay. Queen Kapiolani offers an excellent location in walking distance of the beach, zoo, Kapiolani park and many restaurants with gluten and nut free options. I participated in a lei-making workshop and yoga on the deck facing Lē'ahi/Diamond Head in the morning. We had an excellent meal on the deck that evening. During the day, the pool was calm and quiet, perfect for introducing our baby to the water in his new watermelon swim floatie. Reservations are required for meals in the Deck restaurant, so be sure to book ahead.

The location is convenient being a block from the brachand since it's at the end of w Waikiki, you can readily access it from Kapahulu, rather than having to go through Waikiki each time you want to get there.

836081784,30,Great views // nice staff // hectic atmosphere,"Positives:  -Easy access to a not super crowded part of the beach  -Good views of Diamond Head from many rooms  -Good restaurant and pool atmosphere  -Very helpful and accommodating staff  -Easy access to nice park across the street    Negatives:  -Next to a very busy street with lots of noise  -Spotty wifi in rooms  -resort fee is a brazen add-on cost - anything the ""resort"" fee might cover carries an extra cost. prepare to shell out for basically anything.  -any room with a decent view is not going to be your quiet space. Constant noise coming from restaurant music, pool, and street.    Overall: it's a decent stay for a specific vacation. If you to stay in Waikiki, but have a refuge away from the touristy atmosphere of Waikiki, this is not your place. The pool/restaurant noise and traffic dominates the hotel. If you'd like nice views, a good bar/pool/restaurant vibe, access to party-waikiki, etc. it's a great spot, especially compared to the luxury resorts.",Apr 2022,April 2022,,,"Oakland, California"

I highly recommend the Chicken and Waffles and Deep Fried Haupia French Toast!!! The coffee shop also has delicious food and drinks.    The hotel itself is beautifully decorated, so many spots to take cute photos. I love the wall they had filled with photos of the Hawaiian Monarchy.

Every one of the many staff we encountered were exceptional - both in their knowledge of the area and their willingness to help. Having a coffee shop, a bar, and a restaurant in the same building was great for the times we wanted to have an easy day. Everything that Waikiki Beach has to offer was just a few steps away.

The pool was disappointing, as it was too small to swim laps in. However the fitness room was well equipped. My room was clean.

833550040,50,Very nice location and great service,"We stayed in Waikiki for a 7 days trip so my wife found this hotel, it's location is really convenient since it''s 1 block or 3 minutes walking to the beach and very close to stores and restaurants. The room is smaller than the pics makes it appear but for us it was just fine. we only stayed at night. The pool is small, so do not make great expectations about it. Of course the parking is chaotic and as horrible as every where in Hawaii (expensive). Great service, all the people on the hotel are very nice and friendly. Always willing to help you, so that's a great point for them. On bad thing about the hotel is a bunch of fees they charge you when you do the check in. Those fees includes the fireworks on Fridays but there are not fireworks since 2 years ago. Also they charge you for two horrible water bottles with the logo of the hotel (I'm pretty sure nobody take them home). They charge you for beach towels and beach chairs but that doesn't mean that you can have a reserved place at the beach or a special chairs on the beach you can use as a part of the amenities of the hotel, they are the towels and chairs that are next to the pool.  Other than that the hotel is a good option for a people who is planning to go and stay not to far from the hotel. We rented a car so we spend most of the day out of Waikiki and use the hotel only to spend the nigh in there so for us in our next trip we will have a hotel outside the city to avoid the annoying parking problems.",Apr 2022,March 2022,,,"Mukilteo, Washington"

We had an amazing view of Diamondhead, the ocean and the zoo! How wonderful to wake up to flamingos and the beautiful majestic Diamondhead. It was one block to the famous Waikiki beach and the main strip of businesses and restaurants. It is an old school boutique hotel with some fantastic vibes. the Deck restaurant was fantastic some of the best breakfast foods and dinners we have had! The pool was a big hit for the kiddos, but the beach area we walked to was great for them too! The staff was also amazing - very accommodating and so nice. I loved our stay and the fact that it wasn't so crowded in our area too. I will say the rooms are definitely on the smaller side so be prepared for that ( I was after reading previous reviews) but our family of 4 made it work!

833202162,50,Best of Waikiki and the Best of Honolulu,"If you’re not interested in being in Waikiki, the Queen Kapiolani is where its at.    STAFF: Our check-in (at the tail end of the COVID restrictions) was smooth, kind and pain-free. Our check-out (with the extra hassle of needing to split bill so that each of our names was on the bill separately) was done with speed, efficiency and not even a modicum of any attitude.    LOCATION: At the far Diamond Head end of Waikiki, just steps away from the Zoo and the beaches the Queen Kap is so easy to get in and out of without all the hassle of Waikiki traffic. We attended a conference at the Convention Center (Ewa end of Waikiki) but there are numerous buses running down Kuhio making that so easy. But we also needed to get out and about to Honolulu (and very easy for Uber, and friends, to pick us up).    ROOMS: We had the Diamond Head View with balcony which was perfect view, spacious, and exceptionally clean. (I noticed a few people complained in other reviews, but aside from normal wear and tear and standard issues of humidity it was quite good). I found the room also really functional for sitting on the lanai, doing some computer work on the couch or watching TV.    AMENITIES: The Deck (bar) is a popular and fun place, with a great little cafe place in the lobby to grab a coffee and croissant.    There wasn’t any aspect of our stay that I’d change and I’ll certainly be booking to stay here again on my next trip to Honolulu.",Apr 2022,April 2022,Traveled on business,"The Diamond Head Balcony rooms views have great vistas of the zoo and Kapiolani Park (as well,...",USA
833170427,50,Great Experience at the Queen K,"My then fiancée (now wife!) and I chose the Queen Kapi’olani for our wedding trip based on the incredible ocean/mountain views it offered, and the fact that it was a bit away from the main Waikiki hustle and bustle. Checking in and out was easy, and while the room didn’t have as stunning of views as we saw on the website, they were still incredible.    We stayed in a premium ocean view room with a king bed and found the room spacious, clean, and perfect for our needs. We also enjoyed the balcony, but unfortunately it had a city view as opposed to an ocean view. All in all it wasn’t a big deal as the beach was a short and easy walk away so we didn’t spend too much time in the room. Sometimes it was a bit of a trek to get to downtown Waikiki, but it was worth it to get away from the busy and noisy streets at night. It was still easy to get picked up for tours and generally get around.    The food options are also great here. Knots Coffee Roasters is an amazing breakfast/snack place and having it so close is great (although it is pricey). Deck is also tasty with great views of Diamond Head.

We stayed in room 1610 with one of the corner Diamond Head/Ocean views and it was by far the best view from a hotel room I've ever had. The hotel is situated at the very end of the busy downtown strip right across from the zoo, which I really preferred because the business/tourist district can feel very congested and Vegas-y especially at night. We were still able to walk to almost all the restaurants and places we wanted to go, and Diamond Head was just a quick Uber ride away. The hotel's restaurant Deck had fantastic views and good food, the pool area while small was relaxing and we actually didn't have difficulties getting pool chairs, the free yoga class was great, and the overall vibe of the hotel was trendy/casual and well maintained. You can tell that management takes a lot of pride into maintaining this propertly.

We found yours and we were delighted at every step. The lobby and it's open air feel, the room and the way it was cleaned and the staff consistently gave truly exceptional customer service. We were greeted, assisted and made to feel like valued guests. I would like point out one staff person in particular who manned the valet beach chair/towel section. He was outstanding, his name is KawaI. On the last day I had planned to get several 20$ to tip all of then great staff but I could not afford it, sadly. But I promised I would let the management know how fantastic he was. We dream of being able to afford a trip back to Hawaii and we will stay with you if we come.",Mar 2022,January 2022,,,"McMinnville, Oregon"
831775398,50,Loved this hotel - will stay again!,"My husband and I stayed there for 5 nights in March 2022. Loved everything about this hotel - mostly very close proximity to beach, shops, restaurants. We appreciated the Hawaiian flair and the 3rd floor indoor-outdoor bar/restaurant boasts amazing Diamond Head views that cannot be topped! Overall a great experience and can highly recommend if you’re looking for a mid-size hotel with all amenities, open air lobby, a few shops, great cafe & Aloha spirit. 🌺",Mar 2022,March 2022,,,
831758686,40,Vacation,"Service was great, food was awesome. Did not love the location. Rooms are tight and need some updating. Staff were all very helpful. The views are amazing. Pool was nice, but kind of small. Overall experience was good.",Mar 2022,March 2022,,,"King of Prussia, Pennsylvania"
831753441,50,INCREDIBLE!,"Staff: A+  Cleanliness: A+  Accommodations: A+  Location: A+  This was the BEST stay you could possibly have for Hawaii. It was unbelievable, beautiful, and close to everything you could want. I will definitely stay here again!",Mar 2022,March 2022,Traveled with friends,,
831656775,50,My idea of perfect!,"Located across from Kapiolani Park and the beach , the quieter side of Waikiki, this smaller hotel was exactly what I like. The price was reasonable, all employees I had interaction with were very efficient & showed the Aloha spirit. The room I had was a corner with a city and ocean view, while small , clean and cozy. Oahu has a great bus system. This hotel is very close to many stops enabling you to see it all with a small price tag. I did rent a car for 1 day to drive to my favorite beaches on the North shore.On the 3rd floor is “ the Deck” a restaurant & bar ….good! A smaller pool becomes quite busy.Coffee in the room would be nice. My solution was a morning cold brew kept in the in room refrig. I prefer to relax in the morning, rather than get dressed & go to get coffee downstairs. Mahalo to all! Will be back.",Mar 2022,March 2022,,,Observatory Point Bed & Breakfast
831570164,50,Will definitely come back to this hotel!,"Got an Ocean View Studio on 11th floor for 4 nights and it is excellent!! Room is huge, perfect for couple, housekeeping make sure the whole room is clean and restock the stuff we need. The room is actually bigger than what I expected since what they post on the website look smaller. Everything about this hotel definitely meet what a 4 stars hotel supposed to be and cleanliness i gotta say it’s the best out of all the hotels ive been to. I will definitely come back to this hotel if I visit Waikiki again!",Mar 2022,March 2022,,,"Los Angeles, California"
831568700,30,Vacation in Hawaii,Hotel is one block from the beach with amazing access to everything. Hotel staff said not to use the amenities at the hotel because you need reservations days ahead of time. Needles to say we did not use the hotel for anything other than sleeping. If you are looking for something close to the beach at a reasonable price this is it. Nothing fancy but close to the beach.,Mar 2022,March 2022,,,"Grand Junction, Colorado"
831531565,40,Loved it,"This hotel has great staff and wonderful atmosphere. They lent us beach chairs and towels as well as yoga mats. I wish I had understood how tiny the lanai would be and I wish the shower was more updated but that’s the only negative! The view was to die for, the water refill station in the lobby was a life saver. Knots coffee was fantastic. The artwork all around was so beautiful. And the location was the best in Waikiki - on the edge of everything and not surrounded by chaos.",Mar 2022,March 2022,,,"Pawtucket, Rhode Island"
831500596,10,"Outdated, very tiny, bad service","I usually do not write a review especially when traveling to have a great time for a birthday getaway. However, I am compelled to write a review during my trip to let everyone know about a horrible experience and disaster of a room. First, service is terrible (chub Asian male at the front). Second, the room is very, very outdated and size of a peanut. We just moved to a different hotel which's way bigger, modern, and 1/3 of a price. Do your research and book a hotel where you can actually enjoy your stay. So glad we changed!",Mar 2022,March 2022,Traveled as a couple,,
831473142,50,Book this place if you can!,"Had a blast at QK over a 7 day period. 24hr valet was a great benefit. Kawaii is the best bell man, if you ever see him he knows the spots! QK is always clean and full of smiles. Near beach and key areas of Waikiki.",Mar 2022,March 2022,,,
831451469,50,Limited Valet Parking,"Only valet parking, and they had limited spot. Luckily, we were able to get valet, but if you don’t, you have to find street parking … and parking/ driving in Wikiki is horrible, if you’re not familiar to the area/ aren’t used to city driving.    The hotel was very pricey, but they do offer complimentary classes i.e: hula classes etc. (which we did not use) but they are there for people who like those types of things.    The diamond head view room was beautiful and everything we wanted it to be, but when we looked to the left of us, we saw apartment buildings so we did have to close the left side of the blinds for more privacy, but either way, still a beautiful view to wake up to and watch the sun rise and hear the birds chirping in the morning.",Mar 2022,March 2022,,,
831413902,50,Excellent location and view!,"We really enjoyed our stay here - it is within walking distance to the Waikiki strip, so easy access to shops, food and the beach. Parking is limited, though, and costs $45 USD a night, but there is parking right across the street at the Honolulu Zoo. They charge $1.50 an hour (for a maximum of 4 hrs), but you can easily extend it for the rest of the night when they warn you (via text) that your parking will expire. My advice is to ensure that you are still awake when you have to extend the time. I got a text after midnight to extend the time and it definitely interrupted my sleep. Other than that little hiccup, it was an excellent hotel to stay at.",Mar 2022,March 2022,,,"Toronto, Canada"
831182052,30,If you want Diamond Head view,"Pictures on their website looks amazing but it's not as good in person. When we walked in the so call ocean view room it was all clear view of Diamond Head in front of us, if, that's what you'd like and choose. We called front desk and the response was that is the ""ocean view"" room....we ended up paid $100 extra for the two nights we stayed there for ""some"" ocean view between buildings. As for the room, it's a bit dated and lack of in room amenities and no full length mirror.",Mar 2022,March 2022,,,"Alameda, California"
831156989,50,Excellent hotel and customer Service,"Great hotel. But what makes it exceptionally great is the customer service from their front end staff to house keeping!

831073382,50,We came back !!!!!,We raved so much about this Hotel that our extended family wanted to come too and we came back after 6 months! The hotel is iconic and so much history! You can't have a better location! The front desk staff remembered us from last time and welcomed us home! The cleaning service in the rooms are amazing and the breeze that comes off of the ocean and through the lobby is peaceful! I can't imagine staying anywhere else! Thank you for once again a truly amazing time! Mahalo and see you again soon!,Mar 2022,March 2022,,Rooms facing diamond head give a breathtaking view,
830966412,50,BEST CLEANING SERVICE,I have been staying here for one week and with going around and moving so much they have just been cleaning my room everyday and it makes coming to the hotel so much lord enjoyable . I have made friends with Mata and she is extremely kind and her cleaning service is the best. I wish I could tip her way more in cash but she’s amazing and I will forever be grateful for her,Mar 2022,March 2022,Traveled with family,,
830839742,50,Best Stay Ever,I will definitely return next year. This hotel is amazing from the lovely front desk staff to the great diamond view from the pool deck to the convenient location to the opened air lobby. It is located right across of the zoo and minutes away from waikiki Beach. Best hotel in waikiki hands down.,Mar 2022,February 2022,Traveled solo,,"New York City, New York"
830741036,20,Not a 4-star hotel! Do not waste your money!!,"Do not waste your money on this hotel! There are way better hotels and AirBnB in the area. More like a 2-star hotel.    1. Furniture is old and outdated. Housekeeping is not kept up. Furniture couches in lobby is ripping away, dirty and smells. Carpets in room are old and paint chipping away in bathrooms. Rusted out appliances.    2. Strong perfume in the hallway attempting to mask the mild and cigarette smoke in hallways.    3. Pool is small with limited lounge chair. Always occupied by guests. Now where to sit.    4. Daily resort fee of $47.00 is atrocious. Online says $35.00 is deceiving with ‘added’ taxes.    5. When checking out to request to ‘hold’ luggage is an added $4.00. This is pathetic. This tip could have went to hotel staff    6. The hotel staff occupying the couches outside of the fitness room intended for guests in the business meetings. Staff conducting allday meetings regarding guest complaints and concerns within earshot of guest is so unprofessional.    The only positive thing about the hotel is the fitness room. It has clean equipment probably since all of its management is literally on the couches outside that room.    Had it been that I booked a non-refundable visit, my family would have left upon arrival of the hotel. :(",Mar 2022,March 2022,Traveled with family,,
830664382,40,Very good,"The bed was super comfy, I slept so good. The shower pressure was perfect, the mirror was stunning with good lighting, it was very clean and organized and I liked how you could set your own room temp for your comfort",Mar 2022,February 2022,,,"Chicago, Illinois"
830662116,50,Love it,"Stayed last year and enjoyed every single thing about it. Very close to the beach and the zoo which the kids loved!

830640465,30,Great Getaway with some Exceptions,"The Studio Ocean View Room is a great option if you're looking to budget for your vacation. I had a room on the 17th floor that had a spectacular view of the ocean. It was really pretty watching the sunset from our room.    However, you're mostly paying for the view rather than the room itself. I read past reviews saying that the Studio Room is like a dorm room, and it was exactly like that. It reminded me of my college dorm days. The room is tiny, and the queen bed is against the wall. It can be awkward trying to get in or out of the bed if you're staying with someone else.    There were a lot of issues with our room, from a broken towel hook on the door, to a loose light fixture and one of the lights above the bed wasn't working. We called the front desk each time we discovered an issue, and they were very responsive and came within less than 10 minutes so that was a plus.    We found an Evian water bottle underneath the bathroom sink on our 4th night, it concerns me how well the room is cleaned.    My biggest gripe with the room was that there was no full length mirror. I had to go to the downstairs restrooms to use their bigger mirror.    The staff is very friendly and responsive, the room itself is barely enough for two people. It was great for a quick getaway, as long as you accept the issues that might be glaring.",Mar 2022,March 2022,Traveled as a couple,,"Suisun City, California"
830639871,50,Love the QK!,"The Queen K is a hidden gem in Waikiki. The staff are amazing and treat you like ohana. Location is perfect near the beach, shops, and restaurants in the area.

We will definitely be back soon!",Mar 2022,February 2022,Traveled with family,,"Honolulu, Hawaii"

830464340,40,Beautiful stay,The staff was nothing but friendly and understanding. We are a military family moving to the island and they were more than willing to help when we did have card issues. Overall beautiful! 10/10 highly recommended. If we didn’t need more space and to be closer to work we’d definitely stay longer. The location is PERFECT for a getaway,Mar 2022,February 2022,,,"Killeen, Texas"
830215576,30,Pretty cute,The pros were the restaurant Deck. Such amazing views of Diamond Head especially at sunset. We also loved having a little breakfast at the coffee shop and the activities the hotel hosted each day. The royal gallery on the second floor was so beautiful. The room was pretty basic but clean. The cons were the location. Yes it is still very much part of the Kalakaua strip but it’s further out than I like to be. I guess I like to be more central to everything. It was just a bit far to walk home at night after dinner and everything else. I also didn’t love the drunk and loud college aged kids at the pool every night. That’s not the hotel’s fault but still annoying. Overall a decent stay. The service at valet was amazing. Didn’t check out the gym or anything but the microwave on that second floor proved convenient.,Mar 2022,February 2022,Traveled with family,,"Aiea, Hawaii"
830204610,30,Decent value for money,"- Close to downtown.  - Service was very good, they fixed bathroom tub issues quickly in 3 hour.  - parking was expensive but worth for money as it saved lot of time.  - rooms was small for 3 people.  - very close to beach and hotel provided towels and chairs which was very convenient.",Mar 2022,February 2022,,,"San Francisco, California"
830195949,40,Excellennt service,"This was booked as park of a package with the airline so no idea what it would be like. Friendly service throughout expecially in the restaurant, ""Deck"".

830164818,50,Best. Honeymoon. Ever.,My husband and I stayed at Queen Kapi’olani during our honeymoon. The hotel staff knew and went out of their way to make us feel special.  The view from the deck is perfect and the beach is 5 min away.,Mar 2022,February 2022,,,"Mexico City, Mexico"
829991276,20,Look somewhere else,"Was very disappointed with our stay at this “hotel”. Would classify it more like a low budget motel. The entrance, bellhop and valet were all phenomenal, but our floor and room were completely run down. When entering the room for the first time, it had an old musty stinky feet smell. While a lot of hotels tend to have a musty type smell, the stinky feet smell was bad, and never went away. We also spotted a few ants in the bathroom the first evening, only to find later that they were throughout the whole room, and even found them crawling on me in the bed! We did notify the front desk and they sent someone up to spray. I will say that despite the worker strike going on at the front of the hotel, we could not hear any of it from our room and were surprised when we came downstairs. Multiple guests on our floor have large dogs that were barking and making a lot of commotion in the hallway, and one of the owners had the dog off leash.",Mar 2022,March 2022,Traveled as a couple,,"Casa Grande, Arizona"

Parking in that area is super tight. The room was small, but clean and comfortable and had a great view of the ocean. It is across the street from the zoo and within walking distance of the Waikiki Aquarium and the main street's shops and hotels.

829480784,50,Mahalo for a perfect vacation kick-off,"We chose the Queen Kap for its good location, reasonable prices, good reviews, and its listing as a fair hotel (socially responsible unionized hotels) -- the last being the most important to me! The Queen Kap was gorgeous, clean, super accessible to beaches, shops, restaurants and Diamond Head. Staff was efficient and helpful and honestly I wish we had stayed longer!    We stayed in a city view balcony king room and it was spacious and thoughtful in its design, AND if we peaked out our window we could just make out Diamond Head -- though for a perfect view of Diamond Head, one could sit by the pool and see it in all its glory.    We did not use any of the shops or restaurants onsite but I wish we had! Everything looked cute and relatively affordable. If we are in Honolulu again, we would definitely stay at the Queen Kap again!",Feb 2022,February 2022,,,"Silver Spring, Maryland"
829427120,50,"Amazing Service, Stay and Location!",Let me start off by saying that this is not my first trip to the Queen Kapiolani. I had stayed with my family back in 2019. The whole experience was absolutely incredible the service from the hotel staff from the booking to checking in to checking out was exemplary. The front desk staff has again been amazing. If I could select one person it would have to have been Theresa. I needed to make some last minute changes and she was absolutely incredible and facilitating the changes. She is the perfect example of somebody who takes their job in making the customer happy the first priority. The location is amazing a block away from Waikiki with access to all of the restaurants on kapahula with shopping close by. The valet parking Bell hops everybody is so customer focused. Even the on-premises coffee shop is incredible they make great lattes. Looking forward to my next long stay at the QK.

829354917,40,Fantastic location,"This is not the newest resort, but it is super clean and the location is awesome. The rooms are quiet at night. The restaurant/bar is always hopping and entertainment every night makes it a popular spot. They provided daily complimentary water (as much as you want), beach chairs to take to the beach and beach towels which we appreciated so much. You are a very short walk to the beach. The on-site coffee shop is awesome and freshly baked croissants are amazing! We were very happy with this hotel.",Feb 2022,February 2022,,,"Queen Creek, Arizona"

828904719,50,Another outstanding stay @ Queen Kapiolani resort.,"The Queen has elevated to become true daily example of Hawaiian service and hospitality. Five star service, attitude, helpful, clean rooms, front desk, and a very fun Bell desk (uncle Calvin) and Valet service (musical Kawai playing ukulele .

828664900,50,Wonderful hotel,"I've stayed in a few places around Waikiki and am delighted to have found the QK. The rooms are lovely. Very clean and comfortable.    I'm especially impressed with the staff. All are so friendly and welcoming. The housekeeping is exceptional.    I have a two queen bedroom with a lanai and a view of Diamond Head. It is not a water view, but don't let that stop you from booking a room with this view. It's equally wonderful.    The restaurant in the hotel, Deck, and the coffee shop are convenient and very good. However I do like to explore other coffee shops like Kai Coffee around the corner and some coffee shops on Montserrat.    I love that the zoo is across the street -- it was fun walking around there for an hour.    The location of the hotel is terrific. The beach is ""right there"". You can also grab a couple of beach chairs from the concierge.    I do wish there was a coffee maker in the room, however it does get you up and out of the room and on the beach as you sip your purchased coffee. Bliss.    This will be our ""go to"" hotel next year.",Feb 2022,February 2022,,,"Saint Charles, Illinois"

828550427,40,Great hotel,"I loved the QK hotel, it’s in a great location and the views are fantastic. Most of the staff are great, the small guy at the front desk staff could do with some customer service training. My room wasn’t ready when I arrived and he said he would call me when it was but that if I didn’t hear by 2.45 I was to check with him. He didn’t call so I checked at the time requested and he was so obviously annoyed with me. I got my room shortly after that but he didn’t go through any details about the hotel or tell me that I needed the card to use the elevator, I couldn’t work out why I wasn’t going anywhere until someone else got in and told me. I forgot my mask one morning when going for coffee but didn’t realise until I got there so I apologised and asked the front desk for one, it was the same guy and he looked so very annoyed, he gave me a used mask, a complete no, no! I just got the lift back for my own one. I know it was my fault but didn’t think asking for a mask would cause so much bother. The concierge are great, really friendly bunch of guys. They were the ones who gave me the hotel info I needed, I didn’t know I could borrow beach chairs until they told me when I was picking up a couple of towels one morning. Apart from the front desk guy with the attitude problem, this is a great hotel and would stay here again.",Feb 2022,February 2022,,,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom"
828547486,50,Our best hotel experience,"Quean Kapiolani was the best hotel we ever stayed in. They are very dog friendly and my great dane loved our stay as well. We lived there for just over a month as we moved to Oahu. The staff in every department was very polite, helpful and happy. The entire hotel was clean and well maintained. Having the coffee shop, restaurant, surf shop and Dole whip store on site was convenient. The food and drinks at both Knots Coffee and Deck restaurant were amazing and the staff were fantastic. The hotel gym was much nicer and larger than most hotel gyms and they have good equipment. The pool is on the 3rd floor and is a great hang out spot and has a good sunset view. The hotel is located in a fantastic spot to a park, the beach, restaurants, and stores. We had a great view of Diamond Head and watched the sun rise every morning. We will absolutely be going back. Great recommendation for anyone who is on vacation or using for TDY. This really was our best hotel experience even compared to resorts we have been to.",Feb 2022,January 2022,,,"Hope Mills, North Carolina, United States"
828499816,50,Definitely recommend! We’ll be coming back!,"Wonderful stay in a spacious room with a gorgeous view of Diamond Head. The view of Diamond Head with the ocean was indescribable — it made us want to (& actually) wake up early enough to watch the sunrise from our balcony every morning.    The room was spacious and very clean. The location of the hotel couldn’t be more ideal — steps away from the beach and the Waikiki strip but convenient enough not to be in the middle of the busy strip especially when it gets loud in the evenings. The bed was very comfortable and allowed for a restful sleep every night. We also appreciated that everyone (guests and staff) respected the mask mandate, it felt very safe throughout the hotel.    The staff were all amazing! From a smooth check-in process with a very friendly front desk agent, to incredible hospitality from Mika when we ate at Deck (shoutout to Chef as the food was so good), to Scott at the Bell Desk who helped us bring our stuff up with the bell cart — everyone was so wonderful. Julie O, who we have been working with for an event, has been amazing and really made sure we had a great stay — thank you Julie!    We had such a memorable experience at the Queen K and can’t wait to stay at there again when we come back to Hawaii!",Feb 2022,February 2022,Traveled as a couple,,"Vancouver, Canada"
828451340,50,5 days on Waikiki,"We just spent 5 days and nights as guests here and very much enjoyed our stay. 1 block from Waikiki made it an affordable and convenient base for our trip. The buildings architecture suggests it was built sometime in the 60’s but has been very recently and very competently updated. The guest wifi network was consistently fast and dependable with speeds measuring 38.2 down and 38.1 up (Mbps). Enjoyed dinner at Deck on the 3rd floor which offered a very impressive sunset view of Diamond head. Our room was a little compact but reasonable for the price and the ocean view was great to wake up to. Our only real challenge staying here was parking, the hotel valet has limited space so if you’re renting a car as we did call ahead to reserve a spot or, you can park across the street at the Zoo’s paid lot. Pro tip the machine at the lot will only let you pay for a max of 4 hours at a time, but enter your cell # and when your time runs out the system will text you and let you extend your time bia text for as long as you’d like. Figuring out parking was literally our only difficulty staying here.",Feb 2022,February 2022,,,"Sacramento, California"
828396450,50,A gem in Waikiki,A wonderful hotel located close to the beach.  The hotel had a great restaurant and coffee shop located in the hotel. Beach chairs and towels were available. My only minor issue was the $45 it cost for valet parking. The staff were amazing.,Feb 2022,February 2022,,,

828117209,50,Overall a nice and clean hotel with reasonable price.,"My 1st time to Waikiki. Used my Avios points to book this hotel, but when I looked up paying in cash, they're about slightly over $200/nite (inclu fees, tax, resort fee). I've a very basic room with city view and abit of d Diamond Head mountain. Nice large TV, modern-clean and neat decors. Only less than a 5mins walk to Waikiki beach. Many convenience shops, cafes and restaurants within a few mins walk.    Parking: I arrived around 7pm on a Mon and valet (? $45-$60?) already no spots available. But as you drive off from their valet booth and you have to take a Right onto Cartwright Rd, on the side of this hotel building there's x7 ParkLinq spots. Usually there's 1-2 empty spots left even at 10pm (not sure on weekends though) . They've clear instructions posted. Just scan QR code and go from there with payments etc... $2.50/hr but you can customize how many hours you wanna pay. I paid for 15hrs all at once =$27. The more hours you pay, the cheaper it is. I think for 24hrs was $35-40 something like that.  There's street parking along Kapahulu Ave and it's free from 10p-6am. Otherwise it's $3/hr.  Just across the road would be the Honolulu Zoo large public parking space. Lots of tree shades. $1.50/hr but could only pay for maximum 4hrs each time. And when you renew the parking via sms each time, it seems to charge additional $1.50 fee. Don' t think I wanna wake up in the middle of the night to renew parking.    Many people in Waikiki area with majority being tourists, but also alot of homeless people. It's a heaven for thiefs and pickpockets. Be careful with your valuables.",Feb 2022,February 2022,Traveled as a couple,,

827201584,50,"Great overall, small things promised were missed","Website states that we would get reusable water bottles, and a Dole Whip sample at check in, neither of that happened.  We arrived early, 1pm, and front desk stated they would call me if room was available before 3pm check in, we sat in lobby until 215, I approached front desk and it was already ready, so no call. If I wasn’t proactive, we would’ve just sat there.  Then my valet slip wasn’t paired with my room, since we got there early, so they couldn’t find me car for 20 minutes… very scary, so again, just little things would help.  Most irritating thing was the sunscreen. We were told that sunscreen was dispensable at the pool, so we didn’t bother buying it at ABC. Then we go down for the pool, and the dispenser is completely inoperable. I was over it to go down to abc, buy it, then come back up, to dip in the pool.  So again, great hotel, just the little things would make everything a lot better.

Our room was ready at the time we were promised when making the reservation and was simply stunning. For their “Premier Ocean View Balcony, King” room, we paid $1,070 after taxes, tourism fees, and resort fees. For the incredible double sided view that we received of the beach and mountains, we were so happy with our room. We were on the 17th floor in a corner room (18 floors total plus the penthouse). Everything was clean and the balcony view was stunning. Each day (by around 3pm) the towels were replaced, the sink area cleaned and restocked if necessary, and the bed was neatly made. We didn’t spend much time at the pool, but had a view of it from our balcony and didn’t believe it to be overly busy (it was, however, a relatively small space for lounging, and we did visit during a non-busy season). A significant highlight for us was the sheer volume of opportunities near this hotel. Convenient beach access (towels provided by the hotel), countless delicious restaurants within walking distance, and a moped rental spot just 1 block from the hotel on Lemon Road.

825547761,40,Beautiful renovated King Room,"Our room was located on level 17 and was a very spacious room, with Diamond Head views. The bed was very comfortable, with a large LED TV, limited channels, lounge and coffee table, small fridge with seating built into the fridge cabinet. The bathroom was cosy and functional.  Level 17 has a water and ice machine making it very easy to have a nice cool drink in the afternoon, whilst watching the view of Diamond Head change colours in the sunset.    Two staff who assisted greatly during our visit are Theresa and David.  Theresa is a great asset to the Queen Kapiolani team. Her kindness, genuine and friendly approach, to all guests is outstanding. She went above and beyond our expectation with customer service.    The hotel was recently renovated in 2018 and rooms are fresh and well laid out. Two out of the three elevators were operating, making it a long wait for higher level guests to catch the elevator down.  The rooms have no tea or coffee facilitates, however there is a coffee shop in the foyer is open from 6.00am to 4.00pm. This is not very practical if you want a tea or coffee after 4pm.    One major drawback for visitors staying longer periods is that the hotel does not have any self-service coin operated laundry facilities.    Valet parking costs $45 per day for hotel guests. The wait in line for your car to be taken from you and parked or delivered back to you can be lengthy, depending on time of day.    Parking is limited and for newly arrived guests needing parking, they may miss out as I found arriving at 8.30pm despite valet car parking being included in my hotel reservation. At check-in, I was not advised of the process required at Valet to secure a parking spot.    If the hotel parking area is full, the Valet offer parking “across the road” at the open air Zoo parking which is $6 for 4 hours. Payment top up is via US mobile number only.  Problem being if you only have international phone number with global roaming, to renew the charge and pay the meter, means a regular visit to the car park every 4 hours, as the parking pay meters machines do not accept international phone numbers.  This is not practical at 11:00 pm at night through to 6:00 am in the morning, to feed the parking meter machine. Overnight rates are not available at the Zoo car park.    Be-aware  All hotels in Hawaii, in addition to the room rate, tourists (not locals) are expected to pay:  • Daily amenity fee, irrespective of whether you use any facilities, this can range from USD$20+ per night. As part of the “resort fee” the hotel was also to provide refillable water bottles, but after enquiring they were “waiting on supply to arrive in January 2022”. This means guests paying for items that are not provided.  • A TAT (transient tourist tax) of 10.25%  • The newly introduced OTAT (overseas transient tourist tax) of 3%. Which is now charged to tourists to pay for the massively over budget and well delayed train system, which does not even reach the tourist area of Waikiki.  • A GET tax of 4.712%  These taxes add a minimum of 17.96 % to the daily room costs, which can vary from USD$400+ per night in peak periods    I would recommend staying at the Queen, for the location, renovated rooms and some really nice friendly staff.",Jan 2022,December 2021,,Diamond Head views are stunning,"Gunnedah, Australia"
825536062,30,An Okay Option for the Price,"I chose Queen Kapiolani because it seemed like the best option for a relatively cheap price. So, I can't complain too much about my experience here.    Pros: 1) Decent location on the Diamond Head side of Waikiki, which means it's a little less hectic and a tiny bit less crowded. 2) Room was clean and overall the property seemed well maintained. 3) Lobby had a nice atmosphere, thanks to the cafe, where it seemed even locals come to work or hang out after grabbing some coffee.    Cons: 1) Some of the rooms (like mine) are tiny, with no balcony. 2). Elevators were super slow, but that is probably because one of them was out of order during my stay. 3) As you'd expect at this price point, the hotel itself feels pretty ""bare bones"" and it's more of a place to simply sleep at night, rather than spend a lot of time in.    Bottom line: Good value, but for me, this was mostly just a functional place to base myself while I explored the island. For the price, I really can't complain. But I also won't be rushing back anytime soon.",Jan 2022,January 2022,,,
825527600,40,Very good/great stay experience here! Please read why...,"Aloha! I have stayed at a lot of hotels in the Oahu/Waikiki area, and this was my favorite so far. My family of 4; (mom, dad, two teen boys) stayed 9 nights here and EVERY single person at the hotel treated us with kindness. We felt well taken care of, and the view from our balcony, ocean view, two queen bedroom was terrific. Definitely you want to get a room with a lanai, and facing the ocean. We dined at The Deck. nearly every day, and the service was fantastic, as well as the amazing food (brunch from 10-2 is the best for options) and vibe/feel with live music and beautiful views made each dining experience super. The water fill station downstairs proved to be very handy, and that's right by the activities desk which we were able to book a great tour to Pearl Harbor/USS Missouri from. The coffee store, although modest with snack choices, has great drink options and it is very convenient to pop on down in the mornings and bring coffee and a croissant up to your room and watch the sunrise from the lanai. Right next to two ABC stores (offering even more snack/food choices), and a quick walk over to the beach, the location of this hotel is great! A bonus part… being serenaded by the Honolulu Zoo's birds every morning in the trees as the sun rose. Super dreamy. No matter what, a family of 4 is going to trip over each other in a hotel room, but the bathroom is ok in size at least compared to so many other hotels in the area. The beds felt a bit stiff/firm, but I'm picky, so I don't think it's fair for me to rate them. I'm just happy we were at one of the few hotels in the area that had Queen size beds instead of Doubles. Plenty of electronic plugs in the room, and simple, but decorated cute and beachy.",Jan 2022,January 2022,,,Walla Walla
825510662,30,"Good, But Not Great","Me and my wife came here for our honeymoon and I will say that this hotel isn’t really the best for the price they charge. I will say that most of the staff is nice, the DECK restaurant has top notch food, and the pool is very comfortable to sit at with a great view of Diamond Head. My issues are regarding the air conditioning in the room. We have no control over it and it caps at 69. When the A/C thinks it’s above that, it turns on for 30 - 45 secs and then turns back off again. And it is kind of loud. Very annoying when you’re trying to sleep and a light sleeper. Also, the Covid regulations here in Hawaii, in my opinion, are too much. I’m vaccinated, but my wife isn’t. The fact that they said only vaccinated people can use the gym is absurd. My wife has been getting her normal Covid test every 48 hours and they won’t accept that as valid for her to use the gym. The cleaning ladies are nice also, but I feel they don’t even clean the room as best as they should. With Covid being something Hawaii stresses over, they should stress over their cleaning protocols even more. I do see they vacuum, change the towels, and the sheets on the bed, but the amount of dust that is left behind is pretty noticeable. The hotel’s location is great because it’s walking distance from Waikiki Beach, across the street from the Honolulu Zoo, and a light 5 - 10 min walk from other places as well, but this will be my first and last time coming to this hotel. I recommend saving a little more and using your money for another hotel like the Alohilani Resort, the Hyatt Regency, or the Hilton. In all respect, thank you Queen Kapiolani for housing us for our 2 week stay. We do appreciate it.",Jan 2022,January 2022,,,"Miami, Florida"

Because i haven’t had one in a long time, luckily i stood up when i did before taking out the plug cause when i unplugged it, nasty stuff came up out of the drain. Called for maintenance, and all they said was the drain is small so it takes long to go down but that’s not why i asked for them to come to the room.  Then one of our pillows smelt like old man musk, which is unusual because it was our first night there, ://. The deck was awesome tho and worth to eat at. And then the other thing that made me kind of upset is the working situation . If the hotel is that big atleast have around the same amount of parking cause i had to park at the zoo.

825138707,50,Highly recommend,"We heard about this hotel from a youtube video while planning out trip and we're very glad we chose to stay at the Queen Kapiolani.    Our room was small, but clean and comfortable. It had a decent sized mini fridge so we could keep plenty of food and drinks. No coffee maker, I think they want you to buy coffee at the little shop downstairs, which was just okay quality. There are multiple better coffee shops a block away.    The resort fee covers the beach towel and chair rentals, hula and yoga classes, and other activities and services offered to guests. We didn't end up using anything since we were too busy having fun all over Oahu but just FYI.    The bar & restaurant is exquisite. Open air with festive decor. Drinks were pricey but professionally made, the best pina colada we had the entire trip was from here. The bartenders are super accommodating and you can order food and drinks from a QR code poolside.

The hotel is in a great location, it is reasonably priced especially when we were considering how many rooms we needed but by far the best reason to stay here is the staff. They are hand downs the most hospitable hotel we've ever stayed with and really make you feel the aloha spirit. Big shout out to all the guys at bell/valet desk especially Kawai!

If we forgot something in our car, they would run it up to our room number!

824749722,30,"Not a 4-star, as rating","Overall, the hotel was satisfactory. But I would not consider it a 4-star as it was rated when I booked it with Air Canada Vacations. I found that the staff were friendly, the bed was nice and firm, and the room clean. What was annoying was the lack of a coffeemaker in the room.  The issue was one of their elevators was down, and that left only two others for the whole hotel, including taking people to the 3rd floor restaurant. It was horrible trying to get a lift to the 11th floor and we often took the stairs to avoid the overcrowded elevators. Guests weren’t following the 4-person max and we weren’t comfortable in a full elevator with strangers… some better about masks than others…  If you do decide to book, I would also review your charges upon return home.

During our stay, we met many dogs in the common areas, and loved that the hotel was dog friendly, especially for the service people who had animals and were sometimes put up in the hotel. Once we understood the pet-friendly environment, we forgave the look of the carpets. One thing that we did not appreciate was that one of the three elevators was broken the entire three days of our stay.

824068540,50,"A wonderful stay at a quality hotel, despite having it during a pandemic, holiday season","-Front desk assigned us a room that did not match the specifications of my reservation. The front desk was quick to correct this mistake after I forwarded them my reservation confirmation, including moving the crib and reassembling in the correct room.  -The hotel has ~15 floors and had only two elevators running (the third was under construction, they were waiting on replacement parts). This resulted in long waits to go up or down. And being on 8th floor, I often elected to instead take stairs for the microwave on the 2nd floor to heat up food for the baby. With the family, we had no choice other than to wait. And had to pass up over-packed elevators pretty regularly.  -The ice machine and water dispenser on our floor were non-operational. I had to go to the lobby for water bottle fill-ups. In regards to ice, I just decided we could live without it.  -It seems this hotel has a strong local community connection- there were several guests staying here that had dogs with them. I guess they were all displaced for some reason and were given shelter at this hotel. It's great to know this hotel has a strong community connection, but it also created a much more crowded atmosphere.  -The Deck bar and restaurant on the 3rd floor is somehow separate (not physically) to the hotel, so don't expect to bill anything to the room here. It's a gorgeous place with delicious food however, so definitely take advantage of it.  -Pool was not heated. Was too cold to swim with my baby, but I was able to enjoy it for myself while the wife and baby chilled poolside.  -The hotel is directly across the street from the Honolulu Zoo so it was nice to be able to take a short walk across the street to get to the entrance. Walking to Waikiki Beach is a short and pleasant stroll as well. Definitely a great location because it's not right in the middle of all of it but not too far away to enjoy.  -Workers in the hotel were all friendly and serviceable.  -Valet Parking is $60 per 24 hours, but you can park across the street at the Honolulu Zoo parking lot and renew your time via text, so that helped ease parking expenses throughout the duration of our stay.  -The view of Diamond Head from our hotel room was worth every dollar. Waking up to a late sunrise over that beautiful mountain and seeing the tops of the trees at Honolulu Zoo was a dream come true. I think this is the best feature of this hotel overall, along with its cleanliness, service, and general location.",Jan 2022,December 2021,,,Culver City

It had a great selection of equipment, it smelled REALLY good (I know, that sounds weird, but it smelled more like a spa than a gym!) and was very clean.

On to the actual room itself. Im a young adult on a budget and picked the cheapest room which although a bit small was still nice, clean and had a mini fridge, ironing board, etc. In Hawaii there is so much to do that you shouldn't be in the room much other than to sleep and eat.    Finally, the location: The hotel is in prime Waikiki about a 2 minute walk to the beach and near the main strip.    If you want to enjoy Oahu and not break the bank I would choose this place. Its not the Ritz Carlton but it is really Amazing value for the price you pay. 10/10 would def pick Hotel Kapiolani if I return to Hawaii (which I prob will - best trip ever !!)",Jan 2022,December 2021,,,"New York City, New York"

823045708,40,Crowded but friendly,"This was the first time we had stayed at this property since it was acquired by the Waikiki Beach Hotels group and remodeled several years ago. We liked our refurbished room, one that looked out on the Zoo and Diamond Head, the best view. The new Deck restaurant on the third floor served up great breakfasts and there is a coffee shop and various other amenities on the lobby level. The hotel is pet-friendly and there was a constant parade of pooches of all sizes and breeds—great if you’re a dog lover, perhaps less so if animals scare you, though all the pets we encountered were well-behaved.    Drawbacks? Transportation issues, both external and internal, were a bit bothersome. Parking is valet only, expensive, and not guaranteed, and the bell staff member we talked to was not particularly helpful in finding alternatives. We ended up housing our rental vehicle in a nearby public garage for the week after finding it ourselves online.    The biggest headache of all, though, was that of three lobby elevators one was nonfunctional the entire time we stayed there. That meant long lines and waits at peak hours just to get in one, and social distancing was impossible in the two cars that were working.

We didn’t use the pool because it was first come first serve capacity (COVID restrictions). The battery for our room’s electronic key reader died but they sent maintenance within minutes to repair it. The hotel is 1.5 blocks from waikiki beach and tons of shopping and restaurants are within walking distance. Valet parking and the zoo parking lot across the street were full when we checked in so we got directions to another parking garage ($27/day) a few blocks away.

He made sure we had clean towels, dishes, and a tidy room during our stay. I also enjoyed their complementary yoga classes with Ashley throughout my stay. Wonderful way to start the day. Not so great was the service at the hotel restaurant. They would only allow reservations and the couple times we wanted to just grab a quick bite we had to wait 20 min for a table even though the restaurant was half empty. Staff was very unorganized in the restaurant. We ended up eating at other restaurants the entire week as we didn't want the hastle of waiting for tables. They also told us we couldn't do take out during happy hour even though we were using the pool on the other side of the restaurant. Pool was lovely, lounges comfortable but there were NO umbrellas to provide shade. So if you want to use the pool you were in full sun all the time.

We arrived early on Saturday around 1p. It was wonderful that our room was ready early, so we could check in right away. Unfortunately there was no parking available, the garage was full. That was disappointing, but luckily I found street parking.  I love the large rooms with plenty of storage areas and multiple seating areas. Also our view was very pretty, even though we were on a low floor.  Unfortunately no pool side service for food and drinks. You can scan this QR code to place an order by the pool, but it didn’t work. We walked up to the bar to order and told the bartender the app doesn’t work. She seemed to not care and didn’t offer to bring our order out to the pool.  All in all it is a fun hotel with cool design and large, comfortable rooms. Great location, easy to zip in and out of Waikiki.  We stayed here before earlier in the year and had a much better experience back then.

As we all know, we are not supposed to reuse the plastic bottles too many times. We got a bottle of water in the AM and refilled it all day. We never went to the pool, as it was gross - they have grass ""turf"" instead of paving around the pool. I would return only because it is cheap.

The first location was too busy and city-like for my liking whereas this property offered amazing views of Diamondhead and the lush grounds of the Honolulu zoo. It definitely offered a more traditional Hawaiian experience while sacrificing nothing . Rooms are nicely updated and very genuine and friendly staff.

819924902,40,Good hotel for the price - but probably not a 4 star hotel,"Hotel is rated as 4 star? We got a reasonable deal for the stay here. It appears to be an older hotel fairly recently updated and looks nice inside. Public bathroom is very clean as you need room key to get it. Overall experience is good - but we may try another hotel next time depending on pricing. Location is convenience - it is at the far end of Waikiki next to the zoo. We did a hike to Diamond Head peak and back in about 5 hours. So being at the edge of Waikiki helped. Also i think the beach is a little less busy near this end (but still crazy as expected with Waikiki). Hotel is clean and they give you two containers so you can fill up with filtered water in the lobby - much more environmentally friendly. Somethings though i think they could have done better. For example their website says resort fee includes sunscreen - but it is really just a super tiny sample packet in the bathroom. Also no working ice machine! The only one working that we found is on the 11 th floor that spews out about a cup of ice and would stop as it cant keep up (and we tried multiple floors - either they are missing machines or machines are posted as ""out of order""). They could have installed a real ice machine like regular hotels do. Our Diamond Head view room with balcony does has Diamond Head view - but also close views of other rooms and windows so you dont have a lot of privacy if you want to have the view. The balcony is not the kind that i think you would enjoy sitting and sip wine because you will also be looking at other people's windows. Next time I may skip the ""view"" as it doesn't seem to worth the extra cost. I will upload some photos as well. Also concur with another reviewer that the lobby coffee shop is really aweful - i would definitely skip it.

819597360,50,Best views in Waikiki,"This is an absolutely fantastic hotel - I stayed in the Premier Ocean View room and the views are unreal, arguably some of the best in all of Waikiki. For this room type, you're in a corner unit with completely unobstructed views of Diamond Head to the East and great views of the ocean to the West. I've stayed in a few other hotels on Oahu and the views from Queen Kapiolani blow them away.    Staff were extremely attentive, pool area was well-run, and the room itself had a good modern feel to it. I also felt I got extremely good value for money relative to some of the pricier options in Waikiki. The location is fantastic as well - you're literally a two minute walk (if that) from the beach and the pier.    The only semi-pejorative thing I could say is that when I checked in, I was given a room with a fairly lacklustre city view (which is not what's represented on their site for the room type I booked). This might be partially on me as I checked in early, so I assume they gave me the first unit they had ready - however, I had no problem waiting a couple hours for one with the great view shown online. After being made aware of this, the staff quickly moved me to the right room with zero fuss or hassle. So while I was a bit bummed out at first, I got the sense that the staff really cared about making things right and they promptly did so to help ensure I had a great experience. So this ""negative"" really got flipped into a positive as a sign of their dedication to doing right by their customers!    All in all, I highly recommend this hotel.",Nov 2021,November 2021,,,"Toronto, Canada"
819556813,50,Loved It!,"Walking distance from the beach. We were able to run out last minute to see the sunset. The Deck restaurant is on the property or Denny’s is within walking distance. No microwave or coffee pot in the room. We took a travel coffee maker with us, but there is a coffee shop in the lobby. Staff was excellent. It’s only valet parking. The guys were super friendly and helpful. Our view of Diamondhead was beautiful.",Nov 2021,November 2021,,,"San Antonio, Texas"
819246569,50,Outstanding Service,"Upon arrival to the Queen Kapiolani Hotel, we were greeted by some of the friendliest faces ever! Calvin and the other gentlemen from valet went above and beyond to welcome us and make us feel comfortable at QK. Everyone at the front desk was accommodating, genuinely friendly, and helpful. My parents were celebrating their 30th anniversary and they worked with my dad quickly and sneakily to have a beautiful bouquet of flowers delivered and placed in the room before our check-in. The room was a bit on the smaller side but was extremely clean and had amazing views. Four of us stayed in a two queen bed room with one bathroom and it was perfectly comfortable. The patio had great views of Diamond Head, the restaurant and bar on the third floor had fantastic food & service, and it was very conveniently located right across from Waikiki Beach and some great shops and eateries. If/when I come back to Oahu, I won’t be staying anywhere but the Queen Kapiolani.",Nov 2021,November 2021,,,"Phoenix, Arizona"

819194956,50,My home away from home,I'll start of by saying I am a pretty critical person. But I am a creature of habit. There's a ALOT of options when it comes to hotels. But I have no reason to look anywhere else. The beach is a 2 minute walk away. There's food everywhere around it. It's has the best access to in and out of Waikiki. But the best part is the service. The staff there makes it feel personal. Unkle Calvin and the crew at concierge desk make sure you are taken care coming in and leaving the hotel. I strongly recommend this hotel for every reason.    Side note: I work remotely and I do work from my room and then go out and enjoy the day. Strong WIFI for what I do that requires a strong connection and I've never had an issue,Nov 2021,November 2021,,,
818843247,50,Perfect,"What I like most was that the room was simple. Bed, some shelves for clothes, TV on a table...Seemed perfect for a kick back minimalist vacation. We spent little time in the room and it was perfect for what we needed.  And 2 free Queen Kapiolani water bottles.  Staff was amazing.  Hotel was close to the beach, had a great view, was a block from all the tour pick ups. Starbucks, eating, and ABC store on the same block.",Nov 2021,November 2021,,,"Franklin, Tennessee"

The rooms…and views were so beautiful. The pictures of my daughter getting ready with Diamondhead in the background are amazing!!! The Deck was a fun spot to gather with live music and drink specials. The beach is a quick few minute walk and they provide beach chairs and towels.

818611934,50,Location and retro cool.,We enjoyed our stay at the Queen Kapiolani. The pool area has a wonderful view of Diamond Head. The fitness center is up to date and not busy since you have to get a key from the front desk every time you want to use it.    The room was small but had everything we needed. The shower temperature was a little challenging to calibrate but we finally figured it out.    The location overall was fantastic.,Nov 2021,November 2021,,,"Phoenix, Arizona"

818355985,50,Lovely hotel with gorgeous views,The hotel is lovely. It’s updated and at the end of Waikiki so you don’t have to deal with noise but get the benefit of being a few minutes walk from the beach and unobstructed views of Diamond Head. The rooms are a decent size and clean and the staff is extremely nice. I will always choose this hotel when I visit Oahu. The only downside was there wasn’t a coffee maker in the room. Otherwise it was perfect.,Nov 2021,November 2021,,,"Washington DC, District of Columbia"

818118857,40,Nice Rooms; No Coffee Machine,"We stayed at the King Room with Diamond Head view for 8 nights. The room was spacious with a living area, couch, and a great view of Diamond head. The balcony was small but enough for a small table and 2 chairs. Housekeeping was great - the bed was made very nicely and felt like they changed the sheets everyday.    One thing we did not like was how there were so many extra charges. It might be the same with all hotels on Waikiki, but be prepared to shell out ~$100 extra per day in fees, taxes, tips and parking on top of the base room rate, especially if you have a car you would like to park onsite (valet). We missed having a coffee machine in the room, so basically we were forced to get an expensive cup every morning.    DO NOT go to the Knots coffee Roasters downstairs. They serve the worst coffee and a short-haired lady there was very rude to us.    Deck. on 3rd floor was very nice with a great view, great servers and good food. Kinda surprisingly, they have a good happy hour! The Mai Tai on Happy hour was great; margarita was a little weak but tasted good. If you go for breakfast/brunch definitely try the haupia french toast. It's like coconut shrimp, but with bread instead of shrimp! :)    They were also offering lessons (yoga, lei-making, hula). I attended the lei-making session and had fun. It was short and the lady leading it was super sweet and attentive.",Nov 2021,November 2021,,,"Chicago, Illinois"

817620771,50,First time in Hawaii and LOVED our stay,"We loved absolutely every bit of Queen Kapiolani. We booked the “healthcare heroes” package— which included free breakfast, welcome souvenir, an upgraded ocean view studio, waived resort/valet fees, a whole day excursion to Kualoa Ranch, AND our 4th night free. From the second we got there, we felt like home. We were very well taken care of by all of the staff, but especially the bell desk crew. They were so sweet and welcoming. The hotel was so nice and had amazing amenities, and it was also very affordable. The location was also very convenient, super close to everywhere we wanted to go. We loved every minute we spent here. Mahalo for the great service, we will be coming back for sure!!",Nov 2021,October 2021,,,

817269176,50,Love love love!!!,"We were so excited for our first trip in Honolulu. Checking in the hotel was a breeze. Our flight landed around 10am so we were lucky to be able to check in our rooms early, we booked an ocean view. Although the rooms were small we didn’t mind it. We weren’t planning to lounge in the room all day. The hotel pool is small but still enjoyed it. The workers were helpful & strived to make our experience the best. They offer beach chairs & coolers. The beach is one block away. Walking distance. The young guy name Kaval was very helpful to meet our needs whether it was ice we needed or a restaurant recommendation. Cool guy ! Everything was great. Book with them!    Pros: fridge, AC was cold  Cons: small rooms,  COVID protocols for bar service at the pool. Drinks has to be charged to your room.

816726849,50,Positive Experience,"Positives:  Excellent concierge service, cute vintage-y theme, very nice 3rd floor restaurant; housekeeping and room service; easy walk to everything - beach, zoo, main Waikiki shopping area.  Because we came on the off-season during a pandemic, the hotel was not terribly busy, so the atmosphere was even more relaxing than maybe otherwise.  The only potential downfall may be the size of the pool during high season, but it was great when we were there.",Oct 2021,October 2021,,,
816626991,10,"Great hotel, bad communication and handling of charges.","This would have been a perfect stay. The hotel was beautiful, our room had a great view, and the staff was very nice. The restaurant had a wonderful happy hour.    The way we were charged was incredibly stressful. When we checked in, it was explained to us that our booking amount didn't include a the $40/day resort fee, and also that another $100 would be held for incidentals. The first part wasn't true. I pulled up my booking confirmation later that night, and it clearly stated that the resort fee was included. So this was unnecessary stress immediately upon arriving. The lady who checked us in said we could swipe a different card for the (what she said was not included) resort fee and incidentals, which we did. We did this because the price of our stay was near the limit of the credit card we originally used.    A few days later, we saw a holding fee for the *entire* amount on the second credit card we swiped. We talked to the front desk, who said we misunderstood the lady who checked us in, and she had transferred the entire charge to the other credit card, but we could put it back on the original one if we swiped it at check out, and the holding fee on the second card would go away. We did this, and it seemed like everything was fine. I paid off the charge on the credit card so that I could use the card for other things.    A few days later, I checked my credit card, to see that it was nearly maxed out. Upon further inspection, there was a charge for the correct amount PLUS a pending charge FOR THAT AMOUNT AGAIN. I called the front desk, and they said the pending charge would be removed in a few business days. But this doesn't make any sense, because they already put the pending charge on the other card before. For such large amounts, they need to warn people if they're being charged twice! If I hadn't been proactive about paying off the first charge, the second charge would have bounced! They gave me no apology for the stress, and told me to call my bank.    So now the week of my life after vacation is stressful, because I can't use my credit card for simple every day purchases...",Oct 2021,October 2021,Traveled as a couple,,

Our room was a King - Diamond Head View” with two sides of the room consisting of all windows, so the views were fabulous! It was spotlessly clean. We ere most impressed with all the staff, who were so friendly and welcoming that they made us feel special. A special shout-out to the hard-working parking valet guys. The pool was lovely, with a great view, though to my mind hampered by the loud music coming from the restaurant next door, also a main reason we never chose to eat at the restaurant. They offer a few free events including a lei-making class which was really fun! We would definitely stay here again and have no hesitation in highly recommending it.",Oct 2021,October 2021,,,"Stow, MA"

815352010,30,Okay-Nothing Special. Noisy,"We stayed here for 2 nights at the end of our 3 island tour of Hawaii. My main reason for 3 stars is the noise - not from outside, but from inside the hotel itself. More on that later.    Good things:    Location - For beach access, this is a 1 min walk to Waikiki Beach and there are loads of restaurants and shops all around the hotel. It is also a short walk to the COVID testing site - Doctors of Waikiki, should you need a test before flying home. To get to the airport or Pearl Harbour, you're looking at $25 each way with Uber.    Service - Very good. Our check-in and check-out were quick and eventless. The staff are helpful and very pleasant and professional. Late check-outs are a no-go without being charged almost an entire day's rate - it's the same rate whether you check-out 2 hours late or 8 hours late!    Rooms - We drew the short straw here! I paid the extra money to have a room with a balcony overlooking the ocean and Diamond Mountain. Unfortunately, the beds abut the wall adjacent to the elevators. To give you an idea how loud this was - for the first couple of hours we thought it was military aircraft taking off and landing!    We could also hear the dog barking in the room across from us and the people in the room next to us went to bed late and were then up at the crack of dawn - in and out of their room slamming the door each time. Needless to say, we did not sleep well either night.    Beds are comfortable. So are the pillows. There is a place to hang your clothes but not a lot of room to move around even with just 2 of us. And no chair to sit on -which turned out ok as we sat on the balcony.    The room is smaller than we'd been used to but I figured it's Honolulu and is therefore going to offer a little less for a little more in price.    Bathroom - Good shower pressure and no issues. A little small but fine overall. There is conditioner, shampoo etc.    Pool - we didn't use this (we prefer the ocean) but could see it from our balcony. There were lots of empty sun loungers so getting one wouldn't be a problem. And there is shade with the umbrellas if you want it. We saw children enjoying it and lots of adults relaxing on the loungers. It looked clean.    Restaurant - this was busy the first night we were there and we couldn't get a table for 2 until 9:30pm. But we reserved for 4:30pm the following day and were fine. Deck Restaurant has good food and some great (albeit, very expensive) cocktails! It also has a great view of the ocean and mountain.    Amenities - the hotel provides you with beach chairs and towels. They also provide you with a refillable water bottle. We'd brought our own so didn't use these but they're a good idea.    Cleanliness: The entire place is very clean - our room was immaculate and we had room cleaning each day.    Lobby Area - there is a great coffee shop attached/adjacent to the lobby. You can get pastries and some light food items here along with some good coffee. Lots of places to sit and socialize with your group. There is also a shop selling pineapple ices, an art shop and beach wear shop.    Overall, this place served its purpose. I think if we'd had less noise and a little more space in the room, I may have given it a higher rating.",Oct 2021,October 2021,,Don't take a room near the elevators - we were Room 1214 - don't stay here if you value...,"Brantford, Canada"

814472369,50,Excellent hotel experience!,"My husband and I were a little nervous once we read some of the TA reviews, but we thoroughly enjoyed this hotel and all of the amenities for our anniversary vacation!    From the moment we pulled up, all the staff was very welcoming. We unfortunately could not valet that evening we arrived due to a full garage, which we already expected. However, we parked at the meters just down at the alley (literally a 30 second walk) and it was much better for us. You can either try to get valet in the AM when everyone is checking out for $45/day or pay for meters $1.50/hr via phone app. Since we were gone all day hiking/exploring, we chose to stay at the meters. Lots of people mentioned the zoo parking which is less than a four minute walk away, but we never had to go this far. Lots of reviewers also mentioned the homelessness being scary or bothersome, but that is honestly every big city and most of them mind their business. In fact, there’s lots of Honolulu Police around and it’s nothing like downtown LA, so we felt pretty safe.    Every morning we would get ready by visiting Knots Coffee in the lobby. Other than fresh coffee, they have some breakfast sandwiches and bakery goods which were great pre hike. There’s also good happy hour and views from The Deck restaurant. We went back twice for Mai Tai Mondays and Tequila Tuesdays. Make sure you make a reservation via Opentable.com since room is limited due to Covid.    Our room itself was beautiful. We booked a premier ocean view on the 16th floor so we had beautiful views of both Diamondhead crater and Waikiki beach. We were honestly content with just watching the sunset from our room. Our room was very clean and we had great sleep on the firm mattress. There were blackout shades on all the windows but we were still up by 0630. There was also a minifridge that we packed with poke bowls and beers!    Location is great. Just a quick walk across the street and you’re on the beach. It’s also just a 10-15 walk down to luxury row or a 15 min drive to Diamonhead Trail.

814375073,50,A Waikiki Gem,"Our family of 4 (all adult size) had the most wonderful experience at the Queen Kapiolani Hotel. It has the best retro Hawaiian vibe! It gave us the perfect way to start our Hawaiian vacation.  We booked an ocean view balcony queen/queen room. The space and view was just as pictured on the website. Although the room was actually smaller than anticipated, it served us well. Our balcony view had Diamond Head on the left, the ocean on the right and the beautiful pool area below - what beauty to wake up to in the morning!  Our check in was quick and easy. The valet parking is pricey at $45 a night, but it was super convenient with unlimited in/out and they were very fast at bringing the car right to us. There is the zoo parking right across the street and it is more affordable, but you have to stay on top of texts to pay for more hours before expiration and we chose not to fool with that.  We looked at every hotel on Waikiki prior to booking this one and couldn't have been happier with our choice based on affordability, location, and amenities.  We had easy access to a great part of Waikiki Beach where we were able to swim in protected ocean-walled areas and then could get some decent waves for surfing a few feet away - everyone in the family got a great beach experience all in the same vicinity!  We would recommend the Queen Kapiolani Hotel as a great choice when staying on Waikiki Beach!",Oct 2021,October 2021,,,"Lexington, Kentucky"
814220283,40,"Great location, nice interior. Just pay attention to the details","Overall our stay at Queen Kapiolani was very good. It was well located on the perimeter of the Waikiki buzz without being in the thick of it and has a lot to offer for amenities. The decor for the lobby, restaurant, and shops is a very cute retro Hawaiian vibe, but could've filtered down into more of the room decor as well. The staff was excellent and very friendly across the board. Checking in is tricky everywhere right now due to Covid restrictions, but they made it pretty easy.    My biggest gripes about the hotel came down to parking and bad luck. Pay attention to their parking situation if you are renting a car during your stay, as they only offer valet parking at $45 a day. This was a bit unexpected but not the worst thing ever. The other issue we had was the view from the room. Heed my warning, if you book a Diamond Head View room, make sure you call in advance to confirm that your room is above the 5th floor, lest you have a view of the roof complete with skylight bubbles, wire, and AC units. That's not necessarily the hotel's fault, but it was a pretty stinky view when it could've been greatly improved if we were a floor or two up.    Overall, our positives outweighed the negatives, but if I were to stay again, I'd make sure to get a better room or floor ahead of time.",Oct 2021,October 2021,,"If you book a Diamond Head view room, book a room on the 6th floor or higher!

Location was perfect as I didn’t have to deal with the traffic in the heart of Waikiki. I easily went to Kapahulu and jumped on H1. My daughter loves going to the zoo, so it was the perfect location just across the street. Hotel staff from valet, housekeeping, and front desk were all great.

I took the kids to the pool. We tried to order food and drinks from the restaurant Deck. It was a nightmare. There were only a few options added to the online menu and we were told we couldn't order from the regular menu because they were too busy.

The staff couldn't have been nicer, our room, although on the smaller side, was clean and well done. The location of this hotel was absolutely perfect. Right across the street from Waikiki Beach, the Honolulu Zoo, and shops and restaurants were all around us. Diamondhead was a short 15 minute city bus ride. This was very convenient for hiking the trail up to the crater. Pickup locations for tours were all within a one block area, if not right at the hotel. The Deck Restaurant on the 3rd floor of the hotel had excellent food and an outstanding open air view of Diamondhead. Knot's Coffee Roasters on the lobby floor was our morning treat everyday. Definitely better than Starbucks and the staff was so friendly. Don't miss the fresh croissants with your coffee. They're VERY good. There were so many other amenities and activities at the hotel we didn't explore just due to time constraints.    I loved our stay at this hotel and would highly recommend it to anyone.    Honestly, the only real issue throughout Honolulu is the homeless population.

804320481,50,So Good to be back to our Hawaiian Home.,"We finally got a chance to return to Waikiki and of course we booked our stay at the Queen Kapiolani Hotel. Our first visit to the Queen was in 2001 and this trip was our 16th stay. As always the charm of this hotel is their staff. Many of the current staff were there in 2001. We were greeted by Theresa and Jarris and both remembered us and so glad to see us. Calvin and Kavia were extremely helpful on our trip, also got to finally talk to Scott who also has been there for a few years. Jocelyn has been a mainstay at the front desk and has always been so help us. The rooms were clean and housekeeping as always does an amazing job. Dustin and his crew do and amazing job. As you can see the majority of my review revolves around the staff of this hotel. They will do what they can and even go out of their to assure your satisfaction. The only thing that I could say is they could help Josh out at the valet in the morning. He was alone much of the time and really scrambling to take care of everyone. Overall you can't go wrong staying at the Queen. However, do yourself a favor and get an upgraded room the standard rooms are a little cramped.

Some of the things are out of their control because of C19 however, they made the best out of it and made guests stay comfortable as expected.    Registration at the Front Desk was fast and very thorough with additional covid information. They double check the Safe Travel screening so logging on before checking in would save a lot of time. Elevators are 4 person max, but there are 3 so not much wait time. The day time can get active, just asked the staff for access to the stair; they will allow you.    The Deck restaurant is on the 3rd floor tends to get very busy so making reservations are recommended or just go on OpenTable.com. You'll thank me later.    Beach is close, less than 5 minutes as well as other food options. For late night hunger, we just UberEATS. OMG grill was so good. Parking is a little tight which is understandable. There a lot of people coming down to Hawaii. Our view was everything, especially since we are coming from Chicago. The real highlights about our trip is the excellent service from the front desk staff. Had multiple great conversations with Allan during the evenings. Theresa gave us recommendations on food.

After a successful check-in with our chosen airline and passing the Safe Travels Hawaii requirements which included the Q.R. code, we, my party of 4, after being given our bracelets, to signify we are all good for travel. After a long 9 hour flight from the mainland, we were all shock at our treatment at check-in at the hotel. This was on August 1, 2021 at around 5PM. For the positives, our whole vacation was great and worth the expense. This was the vacation of our dreams to escape the nightmare of the covid virus. I would like to give a big shoutout to the best bell staff especially Kawal in the A.M. and David in the P.M.. They went above and beyond to assist us thereby erasing our initial bad experience. Also, thanking the housekeeping staff and the hotel staff who address the issue of our broken fridge and replaced it with a brand new one in no time. The one negative was the bathtub floor which was slippery, the lack of help aides, and the lack of storage for our bathtub toiletries. This is just minor. But, it would be more satisfying if management reach out to me in regards to our traumatic check-in.

802135119,40,Good time,This place is close to the beach with magnificent views of diamond head and the beach. I loved the coffee area and the Deck. Both great for a bite to eat. This hotel is close to a lot of shopping as well and about a 20 minute walk to Leonard’s. The only thing I really didn’t like is that our room never cooled below 75. When you’re on the beach all day or coming back from a hike it is miserable to come to a room that won’t cool below that. Also I like to sleep around 70-72 degrees so it was hard to get comfortable at night. I asked the hotel several times to fix it or give us a cooler room. They said they adjusted it but it was the same. If it wasn’t for that they would’ve gotten a higher review from me. But overall this was a good stay.,Aug 2021,August 2021,Traveled as a couple,,

The staff at The Deck were friendly And overall amazing hospitality was just what we needed after a long first leg of our trip.

We saw so many rainbows every day. The hotel staff was fantastic, a special shout out to Jocelyn at the front desk - service with a huge smile from her. Thanks Jocelyn. Also, the valet/towel station staff were awesome. The lobby is huge and has a Pineapple ice place, a surf shop and coffee shop.

800612953,50,Loved it!,"The staff are very welcoming and helpful. One of the cleaning ladies saw me get off of the elevator with a soup bowl and knocked on the door to hand me a spoon, which I needed! The hotel is walking distance (literally steps away) from the beach, Honolulu zoo, and the aquarium. The view of Diamond head crater from the pool/DECK restaurant are AMAZING. My room was located on the mezzanine floor, so the view wasn’t the greatest from there— the room faced a hostel, which the bathroom and kitchen were outside. We could see people cooking, sleeping, using the restroom from our window so we kept the blackout curtain down. The room itself, however, is very nice. The blankets do make a lot of lint, which stuck to my clothes and hair. That’s the only negative thing I have to say. The hotel is also an easy pick up- drop off point for many buses and the trolley.

798386678,50,Paradise,"Queen Kapiolani is simply amazing. You can't beat the location. It is far enough away from the craziness of the main drag of Waikiki that you feel you are a bit more isolated but close enough that a short walk gets you to the heart of it all. The hotel not only has ocean views, but also an amazing view of Diamond Head and all of the greenery in the zoo and park across the street. Waking up to the sounds of jungle birds and monkeys is kind of cool! Our room was probably one of the best room we have ever stayed at in a hotel. We couldn't get enough of sitting on our deck looking at the ocean and Diamond Head and feeling the trade winds. The staff is very nice and always eager to help. We were also blown away by the Deck restaurant. The food was exceptional and offered the best meal we had on the island. Only negative, and it is so minor, but do feel the need to call attention to it, is the staff at the coffee place (not associated with the hotel) in the hotel lobby is a bit surly. But man, everyone else was so nice!

796571349,40,"Great area to stay for families, terrible ""resort"".","We stayed here for about a week. The location was excellent especially for families with small children. We spent a few hours at the zoo, took a short walks to some perfect beaches for toddlers, and walked in the evening through the park. All of Waikiki is within walking distance or a short bus ride. You can get a daily bus pass at several of the ABC stores and can take it to the hilton (other end of Waikiki) if you want to visit over there or up the street to Leonard's bakery for malasadas or possibly to diamond head for hiking. We didn't rent a car. This area was a little less crowded than the middle of Waikiki, but you may find yourself going a little farther for some restaurants.    For the hotel the rooms were nice and clean, remodeled with beautiful windows, but you can still tell this was an older hotel by the popcorn ceilings in the rooms and bathrooms. Staff was friendly and more often than not helpful. Our room wasn't cleaned the first two days which we thought might be intentional, but the lobby staff said we shouldn't use the make up room signs cause it can be confusing. When they did clean they did a great job. The staff was excellent and anyone that responded to our request outside the front desk was quick, friendly, and helpful. The pool area is very nice though the pool size is small compared to most hotels and not a resort pool. Some local kids that were using the pool taught our daughter to swim there which was a little nervous, but pretty awesome. I think anyone that eats at the restaurant or the public can use the pool so don't really need to stay there for that.    Queen Kapiolani like other hotels in Waikiki charge a resort fee. When you're comparing prices make sure to factor this in as it is mandatory and basically a way to make their prices look lower than they are I think we paid $35 or $40 a night extra. In my experience, having a pool at your hotel and providing Wi-Fi doesn't usually make a hotel a resort. Sometimes they also call this a hospitality fee. There industry is the hospitality industry how can there be an extra fee? Whatever it's called the price should be all in the rate and you need to compare places with all fees and taxes calculated.    Long list of complaints about amenities: Basically expect nothing. According to the hotel, you need to book a suite to have either a microwave or coffee maker in your room. They said guests can share the one microwave by the coffee shop. Which I saw but when I went to use it the next morning it disappeared. Fortunately, an ABC store let me use theirs. There is a coffee shop onsite, but it's very overpriced. ABC store a block away sold basic coffee for a third of the price and Kai Coffee about a half mile away at the beach is good if you want something premium. The hotel and staff advertised a welcome gift of a sample dole whip from the dole the shop in their hotel. This ended up being like a ketchup container sample, we truly thought they were joking. What kind of welcome is that? Definitely, don't plan anything around that. It was nice to receive water bottles, but I wonder if there isn't a more sustainable way they can do it, as we didn't need them after our stay. Also, on our floor the water bottles were too tall for the water machine and so no matter how we tried it always left a big puddle of water on the floor. The pool had towels available but when we went they didn't have drink or food service. I think they close in like the middle of the day or something and what they would've had was limited. It wasn't like there was a bar geared towards the pool area like you think when you're paying for a resort. The pool was closed one time for a private party as well. As for chairs and other beach stuff, we were able to get towels daily but on our 6 days we only got a chair once when we went at 7:30am and it was the only they had left. We were counting on laundry at the hotel too, and it is only done offsite and to get a price sheet they directed us to an empty desk by the valets. The zoo discount was limited to a specific end of day program so we couldn't use that either.    Terribly frustrating that they didn't have basic amenities (don't even think about breakfast), but if those ""resort"" things weren't advertised this hotel and charged for this would've been a decent stay.    Tips for the area: Lines could be really long at the restaurants on the beach right now and the closer you get to the center the longer you might wait. Our first day we waited 2 hours for takeout breakfast. Just get something nearby or a little off the main street the food is about the same. The beaches were awesome in the morning for kids, but got too strong in the afternoon / early evenings when we went so if you don't like the waves you might just be there at the wrong time. We liked the beach best for little kids at Kealohilani and Kalakaua avenues. Take an early evening stroll away from Waikiki along queens beach, the park, and past the aquarium. You'll see lots of locals just relaxing and get a contrast from the tourists crowds. Uber/Lyft to and from the hotel for us was between $30 and $120. Just keep refreshing until you get something you can live with.",Jul 2021,June 2021,,City views are nice and high up but we mainly saw a staff break area. Don't expect a city...,San Jose

David Kim and all the front desk and bellmen made sure our check-in went super smoothly and that we had everything we needed as soon as we stepped out of our car. Felt like a rock star getting the royal treatment - actually we felt that way the whole time. Management and staff are really at the top of their game - better then many more expensive places I've stayed recently (and chosen not to review as a result). The staff here are full of genuine aloha and deserve credit for their warm, welcoming, and professional service.    The room had plenty of space, a super comfortable king sized bed, huge windows and a nice lanai with ocean and Diamond Head views. Amazing.    T.V. was huge, but we didn't watch it. The hotel has recent upgrades and the room had plenty of USB sockets to charge devices.    Shower was ok, although I prefer a hand-held shower head, seems many U.S. hotels don't have that.    The restaurant, Deck, has great food, but make sure you reserve to get a breakfast spot...    Complimentary morning yoga a plus. They have a nice pool as well.    Love it when I don't wanna leave!  And that's exactly how I felt upon checkout.    If you want to be in Waikiki, this hotel is a great choice - my first choice - and I like the location across from the zoo and the huge Kapiolani park, nestled just beneath iconic Diamond Head crater (which you should hike while here!).

The bathtub had slow drainage. The toilet seat was uncomfortable and low. The beds were comfortable. One night I felt a bug crawling on me then we kept the bathroom window closed at night. The ac was loud so was the fridge. The sun tan lotion dispenser was not working and they stopped giving samples away so we had to purchase. I’d asked for a corner room but didn’t get one.

We shared a room with two comfortable queen beds with another son and didn't feel cramped for space. We had a great view of Diamond Head and could see the beach from the balcony. The hotel is a short walk from the beach and a longer walk (or easy taxi/Uber/Lyft ride) from all the shopping and activities on up the beach. But its location made it an easy drive to reach other locations and it was away from the hustle and bustle (and noise and traffic) of all the activity. The Deck is the onsite restaurant, which had great food for breakfast and dinner. The downside due to the pandemic restrictions was the limited seating and the need to make reservations for a table. But there were seats just outside the restaurant for those who just wanted a quick drink and the menu was available for room service. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The guys at the bell hop desk were great with assistance, retrieving our car, and with advice on the best way to get to the airport (taxi direct for about the same cost as a multiple-stop shared shuttle).

The staff were truly helpful, calling us when the room was ready about an hour before the regular check-in time (something we appreciated at the end of our Hawaiian vacation), holding our luggage while we waited, and arranging for airport drop-off the next day. Restaurants are not cheap in Waikiki or Hawaii in general, but the hotel allows you to bring in your own food/drinks from the nearby less expensive ABC stores or fast-food places and eat in their spacious lobby at tables. The hotel is also dog-friendly and family-oriented; no party antics like you might see in other beachfront hotels around the world.",Jun 2021,June 2021,,,Capers Bend
794298878,40,Really Good 4.3,This is a really good place. People are helpful and as accommodating as possible for being a mid priced Waikiki Hotel right off the main beach road.

794242319,50,Fantastic hotel!!!,"My husband and I stayed for 3 nights and wish we could have stayed longer. We travelled for our “20th” anniversary trip that we had to reschedule 3 times due to Covid from April 2020 (It was actually closer to our 21st) We knew we wanted to spend a few nights at a beautiful hotel, but our budget didn’t allow for the oceanfront properties directly on the beach and we wanted a balcony. We discovered the Queen Kapiolani by accident through Booking.com and loved that we could afford to have a beautiful ocean view while not being directly on the beach, and decided to pay a little more for the premier ocean view room. When we rescheduled we booked directly through the hotel and when I mentioned that our trip was for a special occasion, I was told they’d put in a request for a higher floor for us. We weren’t expecting anything, but we were overjoyed when we went to the elevator to our room and realized they had given us a room on the PH floor. Our view was outstanding! It was completely unexpected and so special!! We feel the extra cost for the premier ocean view room would be worth it no matter the floor, the sweeping views were beautiful. Everything was clean, check in was efficient and the staff was super friendly. One of our favorite things about the hotel were the decorations. If we could have brought home one of every one of the Hawaiian paintings we would have. Beautifully done! We enjoyed drinks on the deck, coffee downstairs every morning and even some Dole whip. We also appreciated the filtered water fountain to fill our bottles before our morning hikes. Excellent location, very walkable, we even heard some Zoo animals. Our only hiccup was that when we arrived to Valet our car, we were told there was no parking left. But he told us about a lot nearby and also the zoo. We opted for the lot a few blocks away. It was inconvenient, but I think that is not uncommon in Honolulu. And we didn’t mind the walk, you’re in Hawai’i after all! We would recommend the hotel to any of our friends and have already made reservations to return in December, but probably not on the PH floor :)",Jun 2021,March 2021,Traveled as a couple,,"Traverse City, Michigan"
793560882,50,Cute hotel with great location.,"This hotel was super cute. I was surprised this hotel was so nice, since the price was reasonable. Our room was small, but it was very clean and the bed was comfortable. The location was great! We walked to most things we wanted to do. We did 3 tours while there, and 2 of them picked us up and brought us back to the hotel. The third tour picked us up and brought us back to a hotel nearby. Loved the pool and the view of Diamond head from there. Richard, the concierge there, was awesome and helped us get tickets to a luau, which turned out to be our favorite part of our 1st trip to Hawaii.

792567394,50,"FABULOUS hotel, clean, cozy and beautiful","I LOVE this hotel! I'm used to staying at Holiday Inn Express or a Best Western so you know kind of how to rank this - it's quite a bit nicer than those with a LOVELY lobby, bright but soothing colors and artwork and many amenities.  There's a surf shop, coffee shop and a restaurant (which was a little pricey for me at $20 - $45 an entree...worth it I'm sure though). Bell services - Calvin at the desk was so nice and helpful. Beautiful pool, nicely appointed rooms. The only negative thing was I could actually hear the neighbors' TV next door, through the wall! Yikes! Luckily they didn't stay up late. Room was otherwise moderately quiet and VERY clean. I escaped a fleabag hotel my first ever day in Hawaii and got a smokin' rate for Queen K. via a 3rd party website called Agoda.com. $120 a night, probably bc I booked at the last second.

792553123,30,Parking…,"Spent a night at this hotel last weekend. It isn’t easy to figure out where to check in as it occupies a block on busy street. When we pulled up, the valet person says they have no parking. Suggests we park at the zoo across the street. It’s paid parking but the hotel will reimburse you. I say to him that it would have been nice if the hotel had included this piece of information with their welcome email two days ago. I may have just gotten an Uber from the airport. As it turned out, the zoo had parking, albeit with homeless sleeping all around the car. The parking was 1.50/hr. Cheap enough. But what they didn’t tell me is that we could only pay for 4 hours at a time. So guess who was up at 3AM going to the car, trying to avoid the sleeping homeless in the grass to put my credit card into the parking meter? And again at 7AM on Sunday AM. Not fun. Checking out, I said how unhappy I was about the parking. She just shrugged and said, “yeah, that happens a lot.” I was sent an email with a survey where I input this experience and checked the box that said I wanted a call back.

791049606,50,"Best in Service, the Whole Team","Ms. Eilene checked us in to our temporary home in Hawai`i, and it was great to be treated like family in these COVID days. She is efficient, kind when asking for our Hawai`i safe travels quals, and said she is ready to help us or gather a team to help us with anything if we had need.    Mr. Scot is another pleasant presence in the lobby, and helped us with the elevator right away (love that the elevators travel at max speed and you don't even feel it; also appreciate the security measures taken so that guests have a defense against random visitors to the hotel by requiring cards to access each floor but the restaurant floor and the lobby). We also got to talk one day when the elevator area was crowded and I wanted to ride up alone, and shared some local memories, what the hotel is like today versus a generation ago, and the great local schools we know of. We were always glad when Mr. Scot was in the lobby.    Mr. Dejan (Day-on) gives the aloha spirit, willing to do his work for grateful and ungrateful people alike, treating people the way he would like to be treated, ready with a kind greeting and ready to help, and taking good care of people and their property as a valet. He helped me parallel park one day so we could unload and in-load things with the car, and is gracious and patient.    Mr. Kawai is the epitome of the hotel for our family - the openness, the talents (service to all, young and old; playing the uke when can, with great songs and voice), the language, the Hawai`i insider advice for malihini and regulars and locals, and the quickness to help whether he is tipped or not - just to make things better and easier for those who stay here. He is the hoku of the hotel.    Mr. Josh is bright and thoughtful as a valet, wanting to see how we've been so far in our stay and in our days on the island, and makes our moments of getting the car interesting by catching up with us and finding ways to keep up the conversation no matter how brief - he has an active mind and natural amiableness and also seems like he'd be a good manager or lead if ever he wanted.    Mr. Andrew Tran always comes out to greet me on the graveyard shift with quick and simple good service, and yet he pays attention to the people he helps, remembering my name after a couple midnight runs, and making sure he had done and given everything I needed before I returned to the room.

790704647,40,A Favorite Place to Stay in Honolulu,"The rooms are bright and clean. The location of the Queen is great, we love to walk along the water and up to Diamond Head and it provides a great jumping off spot for that as well as walking to restaurants in Waikiki. The staff is always friendly and helpful. During our May visit, the staff were verifying that all guests had been tested for Covid prior to arrival. Due to Covid, the number of people allowed in the workout facility was very limited and therefore it was difficult to make a reservation, but it is a really nice facility and we appreciated their care and guidelines to ensure our safety. We have stayed at the Queen 4 times and it continues to be a favorite for our family. We did notice that the rooms are just starting to show a little wear, specifically in the bathrooms and also with the landscaping - this is likely a result of the very difficult past year that the travel industry has suffered. For the price though, we will continue to stay at the Queen. One note, had to wear ear plugs to sleep. For some reason, there were several nights that had cars revving and racing up and down the street and yelling at all hours from the park across from the Hotel. Also, a lot of sirens/police noise. I tend to chalk this up as ""city noise"" but it was definitely more pronounced this trip than in the past. I don't blame the Queen K. just want those light sleepers to be aware and that is why I rated sleep quality as average. The Housekeeping crew is great, offering towels and paper products/soap etc even though the daily cleanings have ceased due to Covid.",May 2021,May 2021,,,

We chose a room on the 15th floor facing the zoo and diamond head. We loved it. We were awaken by the roaring lions in the morning.  That made up for the fact the hotel is 2 blocks away from the beach. The gym is brand new and modern. Didn't care for the pool.  The staff was nice. The manager was very accommodating (Kim or Wendy? Can't remember now sorry) as well as Stacey that checked us in. It was a nice change of scenery. We walked every morning in the park.  Great coffee at the shop downstairs and loved the frozen yoghurts at the other store next to it.",May 2021,April 2021,Traveled with family,Book a room in the upper floor facing diamond heard.,Los Angeles
790460931,30,Location is the draw,"Currently here at the hotel with a couple more days visit. Hotel, as previously mentioned, has a good location at the end of Waikiki across the street from the zoo. Easy walk to most areas, shops and restaurants within Waikiki and less than 5 minutes to the beach-more if you wan to actually swim as the closest beach has coral which makes getting in and out of the water tricky. Recently refurbished, the lobby is nice it’s an open feeling. The stores and coffee shop do seem to have odd Limited opening hours, but that could be covid related. Checkin was semi fast once health docs were checked and we were up to our room. Room is laid out nicely with a good view of Diamond Head and small balcony. King bed is comfortable, nice couch to watch tv and good size fridge. Microwave would be nice but is missing. Front door opens to the open closet which has an iron and board and a safe. There is a large cabinet in front of half the hanging rod which is good as this is the only place for shelves (no dresser in the room); but the position is odd as there is a huge space at the top so if anything falls back there, you have to wrestle the entire cabinet to the side to retrieve your item. The room has lots of windows and light and 2 kinds of shades, very nice.    The reason for the low review is the extortion of the daily resort fee. This is expected now I know, but if you are charging up to $40 a night (I am “lucky” there is a special and am paying only $20 a night), I kinda expect the advertised services to be available. Beach chairs and towels is listed first. What they done they’ll you is they are 1st come. If you want one, get to the bell desk by 8am as they go quickly. Not sure how many they have, but the limited number they have go fast. Our success rate is about 50%. Our success rate with a chair that works is 0%. Every one we have had was broken. Every chair was broken. When telling the bell desk upon return, was told well it’s hot and miss, no, that is just miss. Also included in this resort Fee? Availability of an atm in the lobby. Huh? I’m paying for the off chance to use an atm that will charge me a ridiculous fee to use it? Also included are refillable water bottles. Only they aren’t available as they haven’t arrived yet. Also available is the use of the pool and pool towels. It is a very nice, but limited in size, pool. But being next to Deck (nice restaurant that is not affiliated with the hotel), the 3rd floor is the only floor you do not need your room key to access in the elevator. Side bar-food security with not being able to access room floors without using s room key-kudos for that. That said, the pool and 3rd floor is freely accessible which means the pool can be and is used by non hotel guests. Which limits the already limited chair options for hotel guests that are paying extra for it through the resort fee.    Bottom line is we’re in Paradise and having fun. Will I stay here again? Most likely not. Too many options in the area. When asked to speak to a manager about the issues, the front desk person tried to explain it herself. Great that you have the authority to handle issues. But to be honest, you didn’t rectify anything.",May 2021,May 2021,,,Phoenix
790400228,40,Fantastic staff; hotel is fine,"This is a 3 star hotel trying very hard to be a 4 star hotel. That being said, the staff bumped this place from a 3 to a 4 for me. The website also boasts lots of amenities for the resort fee you pay ($40/night) that are not worth it or straight up non existent which is a bummer.    I’ll start with the lobby/pool area: it’s stunning. It’s got a modern retro feel, is spacious and just gorgeous. The second floor portrait gallery is also really well done. Where they lost me is the restaurant and the pool. The restaurant is an absolute rip off. The view is gorgeous but $18 for 2 eggs, bacon and frozen potatoes? Don’t waste your money. The pool is also nice but the loungers are floor level so you have to bend waaaay down to sit and you can’t see the ocean at all. In my opinion they need some high tops or higher lounge chairs to get the full experience of a prime location.    Our room was basic but clean and comfortable. There wasn’t a ton of furniture or art on the walls which felt odd but it was good enough. We splurged for a balcony room and having a view of diamond head and the ocean was lovely. However there was no privacy. We ate dinner on our balcony and I looked down and accidentally saw a man getting out of the shower. Yikes! The room was right over the pool so it got noisy during busy hours but that’s expected. What wasn’t expected is how loud it would be in the middle of the night. You hear everything. The 20 somethings coming home from the bars, the homeless people screaming, police car sirens...we didn’t once get a good nights sleep because of this.    However, the staff here is world class. Every person we interacted with was excited to make our vacation memorable. The bellman that brought our bags, the woman that checked us in...we even had a problem with our chromecast in the room and they offered us a free movie for the trouble. AND they remembered to comp it come check out time. Seriously, the staff’s attention to detail and positive attitude made our stay.    All in all, you get what you pay for and this place is no exception. A solid 3-4. But don’t go to the restaurant.

789809474,30,"Amazing stay, but a few misses.","I stayed here for the 2nd leg of my Hawaii trip - 3 nights after island-hopping from Big Island where I stayed with a friend.    The location was great, not directly on the beach, but right around the corner from it and all the action. I highly recommend the Diamond Head view rooms, it was so nice waking up to the sunlight and the amazing view. These rooms also overlook the zoo as well, so you can scope out how crowded the parking lot is, and sometimes you'll even hear the chimpanzees making some noise!    If you want to dine at The Deck (hotel restaurant) DO make a reservation ahead of your stay, it will definitely help. The pool was surprisingly not as crowded as I'd expected - on nice days (pretty much every day), I'd take the elevator down expecting a crowd, and there'd be 3 people max in the pool. Pretty awesome, maybe I just got lucky!    My main issue was the check-in experience, shortcomings of the advertised amenities, and slight miscommunication. We arrived at the hotel (after check-in) and had to wait in the lobby while our room was being completed - meanwhile, our friends (in a less expensive room), got a speedy warm welcome and instantly got situated. It was a bummer having to wait, especially when we had plans for a sunset cruise upon arrival (luckily we did not miss it).    As for the amenities found on their website, we did not receive: Dole Whip tasting upon arrival, 2 QK reusable bottles, and weren't informed of other activities going on in the hotel such as the complimentary Lei Making Workshop. Also, there were only 15 beach chairs available for the entire hotel. All of these things lead to a better Hawaii Experience, and I would think they would be openly talked about upon checking in. Instead, I looked them up on my own quite late into my stay, already missing out on these opportunities.    Regarding service and miscommunication - the hours of operation, room service offerings, and phone extensions to call were completely mismatched. Between the key card brochure, in-room TV slideshow, and info directly from the concierge desk, I was always told something different. All I wanted to do was order a burger for lunch - I waited all morning for their brunch menu to hopefully change from Brunch to their regular/lunch menu, only to be presented with the restaurant closing until 3.    Out of room here - but all in all, a great stay, and I would come again. But please, have things line up a bit more smoothly. Mahalo!",May 2021,May 2021,,,
789802396,40,Great stay at QKH!,"My husband, 9 month old and I were visiting from a neighboring island and found our stay at the QKH very nice! Location is 10/10 for the zoo and hanging at the kid friendly beaches. I was impressed with how clean and updated the hotel felt and the room we had was spacious with a great view of the ocean. We chose to stay at an ocean view studio which was perfect for us. The gentlemen at the bell and valet desk went above and beyond for us (especially Kawika he was wonderful!) and made us feel right at home!    I enjoyed a delicious cold brew from Knots coffee which was nice & convenient that it was downstairs and had happy hour at Deck upstairs on the day we arrived. I would give Knots a 10/10 and Deck a 2/10. I had made a reservation for happy hour and still had to wait quite a while to be seated. Was told the reason was because they were under staffed and letting the wait staff “catch up”. I work in the restaurant industry and understand that stuff happens but that’s never a good way to start your dining experience. The portions were a little small and food quality was about a 6/10 even for happy hour prices. The staff was seen visibly arguing and manager was eating in pain sight of our table which was awkward and not very professional.    My only downfalls on the property were the lack of accommodations for people with babies. I found that neither the lobby or pool/rooftop bathrooms had baby changing tables which was a bummer. And we had to send our hotel issued crib back because it was missing a piece when put together (they issued us a pack and play)    Overall it was a great stay! I would for sure stay again!",May 2021,May 2021,Traveled with family,,"Lahaina, Hawaii"
789740159,50,Beautiful and convenient!,"Before arriving, I was a little skeptical because the Queen Kapiolani is less expensive than the ""fancier"" hotels in the area. However, my expectations were blown away. The open-air lobby is gorgeous, and the whole hotel pays tribute to vintage Waikiki with artwork, music, and historical tidbits scattered around. My group had a city view room on a high floor. We could see a bit of the ocean from our balcony as well. We had no noise issues. The room was a bit small, but that's not unusual for a city hotel. The location is easily walkable to all Waikiki attractions.    The hotel also has great amenities. We did breakfast and happy hour at Deck. The food, drinks, and service were excellent, and the view of Diamond Head can't be beat. Breakfast at Knots Coffee Roasters was good as well. There are cute shops near the lobby that are great for souvenirs. The pool is perfect for adults, but it probably isn't the most exciting for kids.    Finally, we got housekeeping every day without having to request it. This is the first time I've had this experience at a hotel since the start of COVID. We also stayed at an expensive resort on the Big Island, and even they didn't have this system down.",May 2021,May 2021,,,"Boston, Massachusetts"
789590501,20,Frustrating stay,"We chose this hotel because our mother as a last wish wanted to stay there. She had a huge history at this hotel in the 1970’s. We encountered very condescending customer service at the front desk upon check-in. We had a very bad experience in their restaurant for dinner waiting over an hour for our food, and the food that we did receive was either cold or uncooked. My husband went out on the balcony in the morning and got locked out there for over half an hour due to a broken door knob. We then had to wait for almost two hours before we could leave the room because the door knob was removed and we didn’t want to leave our belongings unlocked. Our too unfortunately was backed to the elevator and we got to listen to the up and down grinding all night. As if that was not enough..... we were directly above the pool where people were screaming and singing while music was loud until 11:00. Nothing was offered for any of the issues we had.

The staff was wonderful and I enjoyed the yoga and lei making classes that were included for hotel guests. I did yoga three times during my trip, with the view of diamond head in the background. I loved the pool, deck restaurant, and the coffee shop downstairs. Very convenient and great food & drinks. I loved eating my food and drinking coffee there.

The property is very clean and made us feel very comfortable, truly a home away from home. The location is perfect to walk to some of the better beaches of Waikiki, Kapiolani park and Diamond Head.

788781020,50,Another Great Stay at the Queen K!,"We arrived on May 6th and like others experienced, the hotel parking was full for the night. The valet advised us to park at the zoo parking lot across the street and check in the morning with them as a spot should open up.  The zoo parking allows for the initial purchase of four hours of parking. By entering your cellphone number, the parking service will send you a text asking if you would like to purchase additional time if your initial purchase of time was by credit card. We purchased the additional time to cover our parking for the night. The valet had a spot for us the next morning. We had parking at the hotel for the rest of our stay.    This is our second stay at the Queen Kapi'olani since the renovation. We had a junior suite with a balcony that had spectacular views of Diamond Head and the ocean. The room is clean and well appointed.  For the last two nights, we upgraded to the Leahi suite - all I can say is Wow! It was like having an apartment in Waikiki.    The hotel was extremely busy, but the staff treated us like we mattered and made every effort to accommodate us    A special shout out to the Valet and Bell guys who were busy but always had a great attitude.

788177075,50,Great hotel & location,"A welcoming hotel with friendly staff and well-run review does not focus much on the room as we took a smaller room in their range — which was fine as we are mostly outdoors types and had chosen the QK for its proximity to the beach (one block) and Diamond Head (walked once form hotel, another time took a bus from the nearby stop). Lobby is wonderfully breezy with cool and meaningful decor (vintage surfboards including some from famous surfer and shapers, with info cards telling their history). WiFi in lobby and a cafe and gift shop. Borrow free beach chairs and towels from the lobby bellhop. Upstairs on the 3rd floor is the indoor/outdoor restaurant (Deck) and pool terrace (compact pool good for kids or lounging, deck chairs) with an unobstructed view of Diamond Head, thanks to the absence of any tall building in the line of sight (the zoo is across the road). Of special note is the airy portrait gallery just down the staircase from the terrace — paintings of the Hawaiian royal family, including Queen K of course. I learned a lot and appreciate even more the heritage of the islands. Pleasant walks from the hotel, beside the beach (daily volleyball action, gentle surf, pier to watch the real surfers from), are through the large Queen K park, along the promenade both directions (walked as far as Ala Moana shopping Center, but buses easily catchable too), up Kapahulu St. to Leonard’s Bakery and varied local eateries (nice reprieve from the bustle of the more touristy areas). Never had a problem going anywhere and glad we did not stay in the more noisy, central Waikiki area. Took one of the many buses into Waikiki when needed, including to connect to the marvelous beaches on the windward (NE) shore, as well as to Hanauma Bay (that did invoke a 20 minute, scenic walk from nearest stop). You don’t need a car to enjoy the island! As far as the room, as I noted we had a compact room with queen bed. WiFi is fine. We could hear hallway neighbors just a bit (they weren’t noisy, just opening and closing door or occasional chatting in the hall, within normal). WiFi is fine. There is a fridge, no microwave however. Friendly housekeeping staff will replenish and refresh your room as needed.  In sum, a great hotel and location just off the central drag, but close enough for getting anywhere. Pay extra for a view, I enjoyed seeing the sailboats and surfers in the morning. We didn’t rent surfboards or boogie boards, next time!",May 2021,April 2021,,,san francisco

You’re in the middle of Waikiki, where are we supposed to park? The only option they give you is to pay in the public zoo parking across the street that you have to pay for (even if you had paid for parking in your reservation with the hotel...).  The zoo only allows you to pay to park for 4 hours. So we, as guests, had to go back and pay for parking every 4 hours, to include waking up at 2am and 6am to pay the meter to park on our vacation because they failed to have parking for guests or warn them that you have extremely limited parking. Worst hotel and staycation experience I’ve ever had. Parking cost was close to $60 for one day and you’re leaving your car and belongings in a not very secure or safe parking lot.    And when trying to talk to the front desk all we got was rushed, brushed aside “help” with no interest in making our experience a good one.    I live here and I would never recommend this hotel.

Stains garbage around around and on sofa like it wasn’t vacuumed in a while and particles got stuck in corners.  Also, if you are a light sleeper, I would recommend getting a room somewhere away from elevators and pool area as it stayed busy late into the night and began early morning.

We did Uber over to Diamond Head for the hike but we could have taken the bus which I’ve done in the past. But with COVID, Uber and Lyft are very worth it.    We requested a room with two beds, balcony and a view of Diamond Head. We got exactly what we requested. Our room was very spacious and clean. Gerald, our room cleaner during the week gave me his card and I want to say that he did a fantastic job cleaning our room every day and giving us plenty of towels which is so important to two women (Mom & daughter)! Our refrigerator was very big. I only wish there was a coffee pot or free coffee in the lobby but sadly there wasn’t. There wasn’t a microwave either but we didn’t miss that because we were eating sushi, malasadas, and poke.    We enjoyed the intimate pool with very comfortable lounge chairs. We ate lunch, brunch, dinner and cocktails all at the hotel and everything was great. Don’t miss Matai Mondays for 1/2 price drinks. Sundays had 1/2 priced mimosas. The deep dish French toast and smoked salmon plate were amazing. In the lobby there’s a coffee bar with delicious croissants and breakfast sandwiches. They don’t open till 6:30AM which is late for me to have my first coffee.    There’s free beach towels and beach chairs (which run out before noon on the weekends). We enjoyed making complimentary beautiful, fresh leis in the lobby on one of our days. The only drawback besides no complimentary coffee were the homeless who have set up permanent residence across from the hotel next to the zoo. It’s outside the control of the hotel, they’re harmless to the tourists, but at times there was one who had out of control screaming fits who got arrested. He was back the next day.

The rooms are very clean and everyone abided by mask mandates. The beds was super comfortable and the ambiance of the hotel is fun. Will definitely come back here!,Apr 2021,April 2021,Traveled on business,,"Carmichael, California"
786720827,50,Great stay,"My husband and I really enjoyed our trip to Oahu and enjoyed staying at Queen Kapiolani! Wonderful views of diamond head and the ocean right outside our ocean view balcony room. Clean rooms and friendly staff! The hotel also offered some fun amenities, like lie making and yoga, and more! Great walking location to the ocean as it’s only 1 block away and many food/shopping services close by. Loved that they provided beach chairs and towels. Only downside would be no complimentary coffee or microwave in the room. Quite a lot of homeless people around, but that is really the whole of Waikiki and around the island as well. We would definitely come back here, it was a great trip!",Apr 2021,April 2021,,,"Rustburg, Virginia"
786618904,40,Perfect location,It is super close to everything downtown Honolulu Waikiki beach is right out side the front door. Street is a little noisy at night and there isn’t much parking unless you pay. Would book again for sure.,Apr 2021,April 2021,,,"Cleveland, Ohio"

786592072,50,"""Favorite Hotel When I Visit""","When I go to Hawaii I always stay at the Queen Kapiolani. Granted it's not the newest hotel but it always gives me a comfortable island feeling. It's a one minute walk to the beach and the staff is always there for whatever you need. I also love the Deck restaurant, the food and drinks always satisfy!!  This will always be my go to place when I come to Hawaii!!",Apr 2021,March 2021,,,"Los Angeles, California"
786402509,40,Good vibes,"Stayed here for a birthday staycation with some visiting family. The room was nice, great view! Cute theme in the room, loved the style. I wish the door to the hall went all the way to the floor or had some kind of blocker on it because the light from the hall at night shown into the room quite a bit. There was also one night we stayed that there was cleaning I think going on at the pool deck at 11:30 at night and it was very loud in our room. The pool deck was lovely! Wish we could have put up the umbrellas though. Other than those few things the stay was nice with great costumer service!",Apr 2021,April 2021,,,"Honolulu, Hawaii"
786322280,50,Great location in Waikiki,"I would choose this hotel again after a stay recently where I took my daughter and her friend for Spring Break. The hotel isn't a luxury property, but neither are many others on Oahu. But it is very cute and well-maintained and the staff were awesome. The best part, I think, is the location. It is at the West end of Waikiki and our view of Diamond Head had us feeling that we were in a more peaceful location than we really were. Everything we needed was close by including nice beaches, restaurants, mini markets, shopping, etc. The hotel is a little kitschy which I think is very cute but also clean and updated in the lobby especially. The beds were comfortable and the property was clean.",Apr 2021,April 2021,,,"San Clemente, California"
786267396,50,Queen Kapiolani - Great Views + Amazing Service,"We stayed at the Queen Kapiolani for 6 days 5 nights. The views are second to none! We had a balcony room that had a full view of Diamond Head and then a partial view of the beach. The hotel itself was less than 5 minutes walking distance to the water. There is a coffee shop on the first floor and a pricey but very good brunch spot on the 3rd. Valet service was fast and friendly.    The staff was AMAZING. Every staff member that we dealt with was extremely professional and friendly.    The beds weren't the best but for the price and location and everything else, I would definitely stay here again.    The hotel is located about a mile from the downtown area which was perfect for us because we didn't want to be in the heart of the hustle and bustle. There are ""BIKI"" bikes you can use your phone to rent and there is a station right next to the hotel.",Apr 2021,April 2021,,,
786213434,50,The Queen,"The stay at the Queen was amazing. All parts of the hotel were always clean and well kept. Parking staff was exceptional.......so friendly, entertaining, and efficient.

786200417,20,Not a great experience,"I was double charged upon arrival. (They refunded one of the charges, but it was time out of my trip that was wasted). Room was nice, but not a full ""ocean view"" as reserved. Electricity went out twice. (Once was for a fair amount of time, and ended up being late for our luau). After I checked out, I was charged again for the same thing that they double charged me upon arrival. Customer service was not helpful with this issue. The valet service was great. Quick, polite and very friendly.",Apr 2021,April 2021,,,"Cincinnati, Ohio"
786197601,50,Three cheers for the Queen!,Recently had the pleasure of staying at the Queen Kapiolani hotel in Waikiki. The property is Within a block of Waikiki beach and across the street from Waikiki zoo. My fiancé and I picked this hotel to stay at while we came home to get married. Justin and his team at the front desk were amazing in helping us set up reservations for ourselves and our wedding party. Everyone at the front service was friendly and did their best to expedite our daily comings and going‘s. Our housekeeper Gerald made sure our room was always tidy despite our chaotic plans. I have included some pictures of our view which was from the “city view” side of the building. If this is city view… You can only imagine what ocean view looks like! So glad we stayed here.,Apr 2021,April 2021,Traveled with friends,,"Honolulu, Hawaii"
786097434,40,A pleasant stay with great beach access,"The hotel has a great location with great facilities, obviously covid has impacted some of these, mainly the restaurant. Our room was clean, with a comfy bed. The ac unit was far too loud and prevented me from a decent nights sleep, although I am a light sleeper, My wife was fine. The staff were very helpful and pleasant throughout our stay. I would definitely stay here again, although maybe pay for an upgraded room.",Apr 2021,April 2021,,,"Bangkok, Thailand"
786097233,40,"Great location, beach view and short walk to beach","I would say this hotel is a good value for the money, but does not deserve a 5-star rating. Lobby area is updated but front desk staff was not accommodating or friendly. Not sure if this is just due to Covid-19 restrictions and not being able to see someone’s face but I did not get the same feeling I would if checking into a Marriott or Hilton hotel. I called to ask for early check-in and was denied and also asked for a late checkout at the d end of our stay and was denied. We actually had 2 rooms for the week and you would think they would allow us to do a late check out in at least 1 room. There is no self parking option so be prepared to pay an extra $45 per day for valet. The studio ocean view room had an amazing view of the ocean but felt like a small dorm room and the 2 queen bed room did not have all the accommodations in that were in the pictures. Many pictures showed microwave and sink and we only had a mini fridge. Rooms were updated but a little beat up, definitely not what I expect from a 5 star rated hotel. Booked both rooms through Booking.com because of the reviews but I think it’s a bit of a scam as the Outrigger received lower ratings but I have stayed there before and would definitely give that place 5 stars. All in all, we didn’t stay in the hotel during the day and just needed a comfortable and clean bed to stay in. That said, morning service, Bellhops and Valets were great. Front desk needs a whole new staff.",Apr 2021,March 2021,,,"San Diego, California"
786015040,50,Excellent service,"Awesome hotel for a staycation or even you’re visiting the island. Great location; right across from the beach, zoo, and nearby the aquarium and Kapiolani Park. Also this hotel is nearby alots of great eating places and still on the Waikiki strip and the best thing for me, the view of the Diamond Head Crater and away from the traffic of Waikiki. Hotel exceeded my expectations because of their awesome customer service, cleanliness, and location. They were so nice to accommodate me and my wife on our anniversary by upgrading our room to a PH junior sweet with a phenomenal view of the Diamond Head Crater and partial ocean view. Waking up to that beautiful view was awesome. Thank you and we’ll definitely be back next year. Thank you for making our staycation extra special and memorable. I definitely recommend this hotel for the locals and if you’re visiting the island and wants to stay in Waikiki.",Apr 2021,March 2021,,,"Honolulu, Hawaii"
786013025,10,Very bad hotel and service,"We book 2 months in advance, and yet we get the worst room ever. We asked for a higher floor they gave us 5th floor. The view was supposed to be diamond head, there were no view actually, you could see a bit of the volcanoes by leaning out the terrace. The room is literally on top of the swimming pool/bar area. Very very noisy. Impossible to sleep. We ask to change room but the very rude manager said it wasn’t possible despite the fact there were available rooms on upper floor, he just refused.  Only the location is great. This hotel is over rated. Go somewhere else, with better service.",Apr 2021,April 2021,,,

785800160,40,Quaint hotel on the edge of Waikiki,This beautiful hotel on the edge of Waikiki with awesome views of Diamond Head and Queens beach. Generally the hotel staff gives an “Ohana” vibe. The valet staff all 10/10. As soon as I arrived they said “welcome home” and I felt their sincerity. Also recommend spending some time withe the twins at the concierge. They are really knowledgeable about things to do.  Cons: you cant really enjoy the amenities of the hotel due to Covid. This is a kid friendly hotel so couldn’t really use the pool as kids were frequently swimming in the pool with floaties. The Deck restaurant and bar requires reservations for everything. Also the power went out twice,Apr 2021,March 2021,Traveled solo,,"New York City, New York"
785733578,40,Great location but wish front desk was more helpful!,"We just recently returned from our Hawaii trip and stayed at Queen Kapiolani Hotel from March 24-29. The hotel is great and the location is perfect for the beach. It is not right on the main road in Waikiki but it’s close enough and walkable to literally everything! When we checked in, the front desk staff were friendly but they didn’t offer us any information on the hotel (beach towels, beach chair rentals, who to speak to about activities, etc) and we didn’t even know to ask about those things. Each time we had a question for someone working the front desk, they were short with us and just pointed us in the direction where we needed to go. Everyone else (valet/bell service, activities coordinator, housekeeping) were all so friendly and great! We spoke with Robert, the activities coordinator, and he hooked us up with everything! He was amazing! The hotel room was nice but nothing looks like the pictures they post. We didn’t go to the pool but that looked drastically different than pictures. However, the rooms were clean and Covid protocols were in place and that’s the most important thing right now! It’s also nice that they have restaurants, a dole whip stand, and a store in the hotel! Overall, the stay was great but we wish the front desk had more info for us upon check in!    Something else to note and this isn’t the hotels fault, there are homeless individuals right outside the door and all along the main road. They were not bothersome and didn’t ask us for anything but sometimes can get loud, which may be scary for some! We did not have any issues but I think it is worth noting because I was very surprised by the amount of homeless individuals!",Apr 2021,March 2021,Traveled as a couple,,
785716704,50,Amazing service and views,The service was great and there are so many amenities on the property. One block from the beach and the people working at the hotel were amazing.

The only downfall to the hotel was lack of parking. The first night we had to park across the street at the Honolulu zoo. The hotel is conveniently located by the zoo, Diamond Head, and the beach.

Housekeeping and front desk were very polite and answered all tourist questions. VERY disappointed in the coffee shop, ordered breakfast waited over an hour, was told 3 times it was coming down from the restaurant. Finally received a very cold plate that we picked up from the counter because they were more concerned about the UBER eats than the guests that’s were staying at the hotel. No one seem concerned. Hopefully they will offer proper training for actual customer service to paying hotel guest.",Mar 2021,March 2021,,,

785419178,20,Staycation Local Review,Got the Kamaaina special that waives parking and hospitality rates. Arrived at the hotel just to be let down that they have no parking for the Kamaaina deal so had to go back home park my car and take a Lyft to the hotel. The complimentary dole whip that they offer is just a small sample that fits in a Costco sample cup. Was very dissapointed with that. Hotel was decent. Not to many people practicing social distancing. When it was time for checkout the elevators were packed beyond the limited capacity of people that were allowed in the elevators. Wouldn't consider this hotel for a next visit.,Mar 2021,March 2021,Traveled with family,,
785382574,40,Best Kamaaina Deal,"We needed to find a short -term stay while our house is under renovation. QK offers a competitive kamaaina rate. And when we compared it with other hotels, they fare better because they waived the parking fee and the hospitality fee for kamaainas! The valet staff is amazing considering how busy they are and how tight the parking is. The bell desk staff is always helpful and pleasant. Super team work! Out city view balcony room is an average size room for 3, but the room has built-in storage shelves for our bags. The bench along the window allows me room to read and do work comfortably. Internet speed in the room and in the lobby is excellent: 38 mbps download and 37 upload, enough for zooming and video conferencing. Our room is clean and bright. The lanai is small but gave us a little more space to stretch. (Someone did drop a cigarette bud onto our lanai!) The split A/C is quiet and so is the refrigerator in our room. I requested an electric kettle and hotel provided me with a Sunbeam kettle which leaks and does not have an automatic shutoff. This is a hazard and hotel should upgrade this appliance. Thank you for offering bottled water in place of a QK water bottle. The water station in the lobby is clean and efficient. Hotel lobby is open and airy. Front desk staff is very pleasant. QK's proximity to Kapiolani Park allows us to take nice walks in the morning, afternoon and evening! We also took leisure walks to enjoy various restaurants in central Waikiki. We are satisfied customers and will be returning next week for a couple more nights! I hope to write another positive review afterwards!    One thing unrelated to QK is the alarming number of homeless people camping across the hotel and along Kalakaua's sidewalk. I wish our city will do more to shelter these individuals.",Mar 2021,March 2021,,,
785363733,50,Must stay at the Queen K!,"The Queen K is a great place for a relaxing stay at Waikiki. The open air lobby and great staff start your stay with perfect Aloha spirit. The room was just the right size and the diamond head view is so worth the small extra charge. I slept just as well there as at home! all of the amenities you want are right there, with the beach and the zoo just steps away. Relzing vibe when you get back from the hustle and bustle of perfect Waikiki. Will definitely stay again.",Mar 2021,March 2021,,,"Boerne, Texas"
785132974,40,Honeymoon stay,"Overall everything was great! Guest services were nice, bellmen and valet were efficient, and housekeeping was very sweet and helpful!

785095223,50,Another AMAZING stay with UNBEATABLE views!,"This was our third year in a row staying at Queen K and our best one yet! After a small mishap with the toilet in our room flooding as soon as we arrived, we were moved and upgraded to an incredible suite with views of Diamond Head and the ocean! The hotel was nearly full for most of our stay and we recognize that it was no small thing to give up a premium room for the rate we paid. As always, every member of the staff provided service with a smile and were true representatives of aloha spirit. Mahalo to everyone at QK!",Mar 2021,March 2021,,,"Gilbert, Arizona"
785055733,50,Kapiolani still Royal Treatment,"I stayed at this hotel from March 17-21st and was able to enjoy the new renovations and excellent staff service. I want to highlight the bellmen and vallet. We were greeted by Joshua and Kawai. Both have so much aloha and provide a high level of service. There was another young Hawaiian man at night who was working by himself in the valet. There were at least 10 cars and people waiting when I saw him. He was calm and so kind despite the fact that he had no help. Also, I needed to leave in the middle of the night on a couple of occasions and was helped by the night time staff to get my car. They greeted me with a smile and support for those occasions. Clean environment with COVID. I saw staff requesting guests keep masks on. I donʻt think visitors realize how vulnerable Hawaiʻi is to outsiders who come into the islands with no sense of protecting the workers and communities there. This hotel is doing a good job of that. Thank you Joshua and Kawai for your aloha and hospitality just as Kapiolani would have provided had she still been alive today. Mahalo.",Mar 2021,March 2021,,,

But would definitely stay again!,Mar 2021,March 2021,,,"Azusa, California"
784948601,30,Staycation,"This year has been a tough one to say the least and a staycation was needed! I booked this hotel mainly because we had made reservations at Deck, the restaurant within the hotel and it was convenient to stay.    Check in was at 3 pm and we arrived around 6pm. Parking was included so we didn't have to worry about that.    Check in was fast and I appreciate all the COVID precautions that were taken. We got our keys and headed to our room for the first time when our room keys were not working. I head back down to the lobby which is when she calls maintenance to meet us at our room. The maintenance man confirmed that the door lock was dead and that he would have to leave and go get a charger. Ok fine but it should have been brought up with him the first time.    We go back down and they end up just giving us a new room. We made reservations for a 2 queen bed with a city view and thats exactly what we got. The room was perfect UNTIL I opened the shower and a dead roach was there. Someone had obviously killed it because there were hitting marks in the tub. Our room was on the second floor and the restaurants and pool were on the third floor. A quick and easy walk.    Directly across from the hotel is a beach, the zoo and many stores and restaurants.    The decor in the hotel was cute with a retro vibe. We paid about $180 for a one night stay. The hotel was just okay but I probably would not book again. Overall I would give this a 7/10 for inconvenience reasons.",Mar 2021,March 2021,,"City view balcony, queen queen","Honolulu, Hawaii"
784913576,40,Nice views and clean!,Nice hotel with beautiful food. The cove was sooo yummy and drinks were good! The rooms were a bit small for what we payed for but would definitely stay again. The beach was close and everything was easy to walk to!,Mar 2021,March 2021,,,"St. Petersburg, Florida"
784820102,10,This does not reflect the coffee shop on property,"Unfortunately I am still at this hotel as I write this review- checked in Saturday, 13th and as with other reviews I JUST read, we arrived to be told there was no valet parking. (I am traveling with a party of 9- my mom, aunt, sister and kids-booked 3 rooms.) After a stressful 30 minute conversation they were finally able to find a spot to valet us but I cannot stress how uncomfortable they make you feel about it. *Kawai and the older gentleman with valet are a delight and most of the other guys as well.* This is a reflection of the hotel for not telling you ahead of time that you may not be able to park on site. The option was to park at the zoo ‘if you can find a spot there or maybe on the street but move it by 7am’. It is not the greeting I am used to when arriving at any of the hotels I have stayed in the Hawaiian islands. We travel frequently and I will never stay at this hotel again. It got me with the Instagrammable photos they post but don’t be fooled liked me. I feel awful for my family bc I’m the one who chose this hotel. The hotel is cute and room was fine but it’s not worth the hassle. Trust me when I say to stay somewhere else. Anything you ask the front desk about is answered rudely and rushed, always the answer is NO. This was supposed to be a family girls getaway to relax and we have but definitely not because of the hotel I chose.",Mar 2021,March 2021,Traveled with family,,"Houston, Texas"
784818548,30,It was okay...,"Overall the stay was pleasant. I bit of an older hotel, with a vintage vibe. Super cute and have friendly employees, great price for location. Close to many restaurants, shops, hiking, zoo and beach. Loved the Dole Whip shop! I stayed for 8 nights.  However, I booked a room with an ocean view and it is was more of a Diamond Head view. I had my own patio which was great, but because I faced Diamond Head/Zoo/pool/restaurant, it was quite loud on the weekends even though was I on the 16th floor. Walls were thin and there was a gap in the front door bottom which led noise to flow right into the room from the hallway.  There was an extra $30-$40 per night charge for amenities & facilities which I felt was a bit much (especially since I didn't plan on utilizing their services except for the internet). The internet was not the best, I never received my complimentary reusable QK bottles, and I could only get room service for 2 or so out of the 8 nights I was there. I know it's a pandemic, but if I'm staying at a 4 star hotel, I had at least expected it to be more available than what it was.  They do offer beach towels and chairs, a business center and fitness center as well as a concierge service to guests in need.  I definitely recommend if you want to stay in Waikiki and be close to everything, especially if you are travelling with your family. Not the best if you are on a workcation.",Mar 2021,February 2021,,,
784730572,10,Avoid this hotel,"If I could rate this establishment negative stars I most certainly would.    As public school teachers here in Hawaii, my wife and my Spring break is typically our time to celebrate my step daughter’s birthday. This year we decided to book the penthouse suite at the Queen Kapiolani hotel and she was extremely excited. We booked quite far in advance and were eagerly anticipating our short staycation in Waikiki.    Packed, excited, and eager to get our spring break started we arrived at the hotel only to be told that we were now responsible for finding our own parking for the night as they were no longer accepting cars. As unacceptable as this sounded I hoped to give the manager an opportunity to explain. However, I was met with the option of parking at the hourly zoo parking where our cars would be left out in the open overnight. This was the most innovative and creative problem solving that the manager had attempted to engage in.    We decided to cancel our reservation immediately. We will never stay there and we will encourage everyone we know and anyone reading this to avoid this hotel. As a local resident, I was able to drive my family a short distance home. What I’m more concerned about is the out of state visitors that book, fly, and arrive in Hawaii and are met with this dilemma. They cannot cancel and will be forced to find parking elsewhere at their own risk. Also, this means that any guarantees made at the time of booking can be voided with little recourse until the reservation is concluded and the visitors return home.    I believe that there are no perfect scenarios and problems will arise. However, I do also believe that it is important to exhibit an open mind and especially in trying times such as these, be willing, able, and resourceful enough to find amicable solutions to your patrons’ issues. That is what customer service is supposed to be. Hospitality in Hawaii prides itself on the personal nature of the services provided. I found that this manager and this establishment made little attempt to rectify a problem that they were not anticipating. I am thoroughly disappointed and my step daughter was disappointed that she was unable to celebrate her birthday the way she wanted and we had promised.    Avoid this hotel. I have posted this review to as many websites as possible. Please, if anyone else has had any issues with this hotel … let them be known. It appears that this particular establishment values patrons not from in state. If that’s the case, why offer a kama’aina rate? Isn’t the purpose to boost local occupancy?

784340344,30,Less than expected...,"I was excited to check in after reading all the positive reviews, but unfortunately I cannot agree.    We booked an 'ocean view balcony' room...which it is not. It faces directly towards diamond head, and you can see a small portion of the beach and need to lean outwards. I was aware the hotel was not on the beach directly but there are buildings directly between QK and the beach. The room and property are clean, however the room itself is dated. The room is smaller than expected (unable to fully open two suitcases), with one window. There is also low water pressure in the small shower.    It was storming one night so we ordered room service. The food was left in containers on its side without napkins or cutlery. There was a busy dial tone on multiple attempts to call the restaurant.    While most of the front desk staff were helpful, there was miscommunication. At checkin I asked for a late checkout. I was notified they would be unable to let me know until the day before. Two days before checkout I inquired again and was told the room had already been assigned. I let the staff know what I had been informed at checkin and that we would pay a fee as well, but she said it 'may have already been assigned at checkin.""    The location provides easy access to the beach and is walkable to most restaurants, however I would have felt unsafe walking in the area directly around the hotel at night had I been alone.

We are so glad that we did! Check in was smooth, and the guy who checked us in was very friendly and knowledgeable about finding our QR code, and explaining everything about the hotel and its amenities. One thing that impressed me right away that was different from the Sheraton was access to drinking water. He said all we have to do is come to the front and they will give us free bottled waters. The room that we stayed in was huge, and had a beautiful deck with clear partial ocean view as well as a view of the zoo and pool down below. The room was extremely clean, and even had a kitchenette, such an upgrade from the Sheraton in my opinion in terms of the room and amenities. They offered nice toiletries, and daily cleaning service was never a hassle, all we had to do was request it in the mornings when we left. The location of the hotel was easily walkable to the Waikiki strip, and literally a block away from the ocean. Very accessible! All in all our stay was wonderful, and I really appreciate the extra mile the staff went to to ensure that we had a wonderful vacation during covid. I highly recommend this hotel!",Mar 2021,February 2021,,,"New York City, New York"
783593823,50,Dog friendly,It is wonderful to stay in property that is truly dog friendly.

This hotel provides a very relaxed environment and is a quick walk to Waikiki.,Feb 2021,February 2021,Traveled on business,,"Cozumel, Mexico"
783555759,40,Location and Casual Charm,"We love casual charm and glamping, so we prefer nature to crowds and a bit of room to close quarters. That’s why the Queen Kapi’olani was perfect for us. Five years ago we toured Oahu, but we skipped Honolulu and Waikiki. This time we wanted to spend an entire week on Waikiki — but where to go to feel a sense of space? The QK has been the ideal venue. The location is delightful: across the street from the lush Honolulu Zoo where we listen to bird, gibbon and elephant calls throughout the day, as well as being the closest hotel to our favorite beach hang-out: the Barefoot Beach Cafe; the QK’s decor is fun and fresh, not ornate or fancy; the restaurant offers delicious food; and — of course — we’re just steps away (a block) from the beach promenade and our choice of rugged surf on one side of a pedestrian pier or sheltered lagoon on the other. The staff are warm and welcoming. Our door started closing too hard (literally had to bang it shut) and the maintenance crew was there within an hour to fix it. Gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of small things that are easy to fix: the rooms are nicely refreshed, but they do need a little work to earn 5 stars. For example: the tile in our bathroom is chipped in front of the vanity. A little acrylic paint mixed to the right color would make it disappear. Our tub is small (that’s okay), but it underwent a sloppy fiberglass repair. It needs to be fixed again by a skilled fiberglass repairman. The popcorn ceilings and salt-water stained windows are a minor annoyance — and expensive to fix. These things really don’t matter. It is a charming hotel at a great price. If you can get it, request room 1802 or something like it. The king room is spacious and the unobstructed Diamond Head is stunning. It is a corner room — so you see it all. Aloha!!",Feb 2021,February 2021,,,"Olympia, Washington"

783070525,40,Affordable View,"We stayed in a Premier Ocean View Balcony room. I highly recommend. The wrap-around view of Diamond Head and the ocean is incredible. We just stayed one night for a staycation with the intention of sitting in bed and enjoying the view in the morning. It delivered.    We briefly considered a Junior Suite, but the view was actually not as good, since it's blocked by a wall and a door and the TV. If you don't need a kitchen, don't choose that room.    I will say the doors and windows have an old-apartment feel; industrial aluminum; clunky look. But if you focus on the view it doesn't matter. The rooms are pretty noisy, also. I couldn't hear our neighbors in their rooms, but I could hear them loudly in the hallway, could hear a lot of road noise, and the A/C is noisy when it comes on. I could also hear the monkeys at the zoo, which the hotel overlooks, but I actually thought that was kind of awesome :) You can see them swinging if you look hard enough, and you can also see an elephant or a giraffe if they're out and about.    We sat by the pool for a little bit in the afternoon. It's tiny, but with the hotel at about 50% occupancy, we had our choice of lounges. I didn't want to swim, I just took a dip when the sun got hot.    Re: Location, a nice stretch of sand beach is right there, with the pier and the volleyball nets. If you jog, Kapiolani Park is right there and would be so convenient for a morning run. You have easy access to Waikiki AND Kapahulu, which has great local food options. And of course the zoo, the aquarium... Food onsite is all through the restaurant Deck, but Tucker and Bevvy is right next door and has great take-out, grab-n-go type food. Also Starbucks and Denny's.",Feb 2021,February 2021,,,

It was clear the hotel is doing their absolute best to make the best experience for their guests while complying with the various rules and regulations.    The staff were absolutely wonderful throughout. Valeting the car was a smooth process every time, and I never had to wait more than a couple of minutes for the car.    The best part of this hotel has to be the Deck, the hotel's open air restaurant/bar. It's absolutely beautiful, with panoramic views of Diamond Head. The food is excellent and bar service on point with friendly and attentive waiters and bartenders, it ranks up there as once of my favorite bars I've ever been to.    The room was clean and nicely furnished, although a little small with a noisier A/C unit. At the end of the day, I don't travel to live in my hotel room, so for me, not a big deal. Great view of Waikiki beach.    The valet desk has beach towels and chairs at the ready which is a nice perk.

Everything in our room worked well including the air conditioning and plumbing. The bed was very comfortable and they included both soft and firm pillows on each side of the bed so you can choose which pillow works well for you.

780311930,40,Mixed thoughts,"I had a very interesting trip. First the good. Location, location, location!! I love the location here. It was fantastic. Right in the middle of everything. Close enough to walk to Diamond head or to Ala Mora mall. Theresa at the front desk was also good and the lady working with her my first night was fantastic... I can't remember her name. They were awesome!! The view was magnificent as well and was a lot of fun to wake up to each morning. The people who helped at the front doing the bags efc were good as well.    The not so good. I get sick if I sleep in hot weather. Notice: The AC won't get set lower than 69... and my room never made it under 70 degrees. That needs to be noted. If you are like me or like cooler temps, the room will be hot all day and night (for me anything over 60 is hot.) With that said, they were able to get my some tower fans to help out. Also the fees are outlandish!! $40/day but you get nothing out of it. Only other places I have been with fees I got free food, gifts, etc. They said it was for pool and weight room... but I was never able to go during my 10 days because it was already at capacity. There was no need for the fees. Also, I left a review for the restaurant separately but read it before you go there.    So...if you don't have to be cold when you sleep and enjoy higher end hotels with fees, then definitely I would recommend it over anything else I saw.... Personally, the temperature of the room would.prevent me from staying again.",Dec 2020,December 2020,Traveled solo,,"Haltom City, Texas"

However, it is practically across the street. It is walking distance to all of the shops and good restaurants. We had a balcony on our room with a good view. It wasn’t supposed to be a ocean view, but we had a partial ocean view. The beds were comfortable. The staff was very nice, the valet and bellman were super helpful. We were a little skeptical getting off H1 on the way there. The area north of it looks shady. But, once we got settled in our hotel, it was fine. The hotel in clean but a little dated. There is a nice pool deck to watch the sun rise and sun set. There is a nice restaurant called the Deck there and a good coffee shop inside. I would recommend staying here.",Dec 2020,December 2020,,,"Peoria, Illinois"

They also allowed us to check-out late since we arrived late due to the flight. They have excellent amenities. Better than the other hotel we went to. I would definitely recommend this place.

752330732,50,Absolutely wonderful stay,"My wife and I stayed there in mid-February 2020 for 4 nights. We can't recommend it highly enough. We splurged for their Premier Ocean View room and it was worth every penny and more. The view from this room was the best we've ever had at any hotel we've stayed at in our 37 years of marriage. First, the location is excellent if you don't want to be stuck in the middle of all the high rises in the middle of Waikiki while looking at the side of a building from your window/balcony. Our room looked out at unobstructed views of Diamond Head to the east and the Pacific Ocean and the beach to the south. Plus, the Kapiolani Park is right below and spreads out to the east. So, you can go over there and walk around and see whatever events are going on. While we were there there was a local artisan fair going on. And a few minutes walk away there is a wonderful little cafe/restaurant right on the beach where you can go for breakfast or lunch called the Barefoot Beach Cafe. Don't miss that! You can order your food and eat it in the open air right next to the ocean.  The rooms are very nice and clean, but not the most modern you will find. But, the location is the main thing here. The staff was great. Always friendly and welcoming. The restaurant there is fine, but you have so many options nearby that you don't have to eat there. Overall, you can't beat the value given the incredible views.",Apr 2020,February 2020,,Pick the premier ocean view room and don't regret it for a second,Michigan

They even have a yoga class!    Overall the staff, room, facilities and location were awesome and we'd definitely stay again. Just a few downfalls, mentioned below.    Downfalls:  - Resort fee is steep, $40 a day. The pool area is really nice though and their bar is awesome. Nice to be able to get a drink/food by the pool!  - Elevators are slow! Seems like it took forever to get an elevator (and there's three of them!) plus there's no stairs. We were on the fourth floor and would have taken the stairs if they were available.  - Parking! $45 a night for parking is ridiculous! We were planning to use the zoo across the street, but they recently changed to hourly, with a four hour max at a time. So much for parking there overnight too - they lock the lot up after hours. Parked at Waikiki Banyan - $80 for the five days we were there. Literally two blocks away - well worth it!  - Coffee - we had NO coffee maker in our room. Resorted to spending $4 a day on a small black coffee. Ridiculous prices and not great breakfast selection at their ""cafe"". Do yourself a favor and walk two buildings down to Starbucks or we found a little gem of a hole in the wall (crappy coffee but it's $1!!) called Waikiki Beachside Kitchen - great spot to get cheap food too!  - Shower/water temperature - scalding hot water. Was like a science experiment to get the right temp. Would have the sink facet to cold and hot water would come out. Shower water pressure was like an erupting geyser. Way too hard!

750620887,40,Best location,"We stayed here the first week of March . Location was perfect , we could walk anywhere to Waikiki and two abc stores and few breakfast places, Starbucks , and bars all downstairs from us. Since parking was expensive we parked on the side street by the zoo and found free street parking everyday there , even on weekends . For quick parks we used the zoo $1.50 a hr. If you couldn’t find a parking they suggested a cheap parking structure near by . We had studio ocean room . It was very tiny but we weren’t planning on being in the room much so didn’t care . The restaurant , lobby and bar area were all very nicely decored. The breakfast needs more choices as the buffet looked lack luster and there were only 4 other non buffet items to choose from. They do give you token discounts for meals here and a free welcome drink . Overall I would stay here again. The only thing I wished if they had a jacuzzi .",Mar 2020,March 2020,Traveled as a couple,,

This location is really fantastic, the staff is extraordinarily service minded and friendly, the restaurant serves great and delicious food, and the pool area was great as well. The front desk was really helpful when we checked in bca our travel agent had made a mistake and cancelled our stay. No problem, the front desk sorted things out, and we got our suite. This hotel has every opportunity to become an amazing 5 star hotel. But! One night in our room in the dark my son stepped on a huge cockroach with bare feet!! We asked the front desk to remove it (we had captured it under a cup) and we complained about it. They replied that these cockroaches fly and “are impossible to keep out”. Well, we have never seen cockroaches in Hawaii hotels indoors before this. And we certainly don’t expect or accept them in our room. Another huge cockroach lived on the ceiling in the hall way right outside our door, eventually fell to the floor and hung out there a couple of days until we asked the cleaners to remove it. Why didn’t the cleaners see it themselves? The interior decorations of our suite was very outdated, basic, and non-luxurious. Only one of the bathrooms had been renovated and looked nice. The toilet in the old bathroom got clogged and all the toiletwater ran out on the floor. Furthermore, the wrap-around lanai, however big, just looked like a dirty roof with a railing.

The pool is small and un-inviting and is catered for the younger crowd. Lucky the beach is close by.  We didn’t even have a kettle in the room so we had to pay exorbitant prices for coffee each morning.  We were supposed to get a room with a kitchenette but that wasn’t to be. The hotel and the travel company are not taking the blame on that one even though it clearly states this in our itinerary.  The staff were very uncommitted to helping with our situation.

746165643,30,"Disappointed with old, dated room","I was very excited to stay at this property based on all these glowing reviews on TA. Found out later this hotel mostly caters to locals so I suspect they are boosting ratings. Booked a Diamond Head view room with a balcony. The room was very dated, especially the bathroom that needed a major renovation. We never got our room cleaned even though we put the tag outside our door. Very few towels are given in the room and of poor quality. There are water stations on certain floors but you need to bring your own cups or bottles. Would have preferred having bottled water in the room instead. The icing on the cake was after spending the day in Turtle Bay and having the long drive back to be told by valet they had no room for my car. They had the nerve to send me to another property with no guarantee they could accommodate me. I asked to speak with the manager Allan who basically said we had to go elsewhere. Not the answer I wanted to hear at 12 am and tired from the long drive. Pictures on the website are not what they appear except the pool area and lobby are updated. Check out at 11 am is rather early compared to other hotels check out at 12 pm. Calvin the bellhop was super friendly though. Would not recommend this property.",Feb 2020,February 2020,,,NJ
745952015,40,Excellent Location - Newly Renovated - Pro's & Con's,"PRO'S  1. Best part about this hotel is the location - About 1 block off the beach and on the last street of the ""concrete jungle"" of hotels, facing a park and the Zoo across the street. Much quieter than the center of Waikiki. Easy walking distance to downtown Waikiki and less touristy restaurants in nearby residential areas.    2. Great views (and selfies) of Diamond Head from hotel pool and bar.    3. Reef safe sun lotion provided in a dispenser by the pool (BYO small container to refill).    CON'S  1. Even though the hotel is recently renovated, it's still a 1960's-style floor plan. The balcony of our ocean view room faced dozens of hotels, not the ocean. The bathroom is small and cramped, with no place to easily hang wet swimsuits.    2. Beach Chairs are available (for free) at the Bell Desk. However, a few days, we were told there were no chairs available. We later found out there are only about 30 total chairs for hundreds of rooms/guests. We noticed some guests keeping chairs for the duration of their stay, assuring them chairs every day.    3. Maid service was spotty. We didn't get our room cleaned 2 days during our 7-day stay, despite being gone from the room for 5 hours during the day. The front desk told us maid service stops at 3:30p.    4. We were lucky to score a great nightly rate without a resort fee, but honestly, I would not be as happy with my stay if we paid a higher price (not excellent enough to justify a high price and/or additional resort fee). This is a hotel, not a resort.    MORE TIPS  1. Be sure to look at ALL rates on the page for a rate without a resort fee; these seemed to be more towards the bottom of the page.",Feb 2020,January 2020,,Room 1609 - Corner Overview Balcony. Quiet.

The lobby/pool/bar area are all top notch- renovated relatively recently, the lobby feels open and breezy, and the pool/bar area is trendy without being overbearing. I was quickly checked into my room on a high floor, and given poker chips to use for discounts at the bar/breakfast.    Unfortunately the room itself left much to be desired- it had a lovely ocean view but was old and in desperate need of renovation, particularly the bathroom which was stained and just felt old.    Given what I paid for my one night stay this was all more than adequate, and given how lovely the property is, I am happy to give this spot 4 stars, but the room itself was no better than a 3 star property.

There is a sense of high professionalism in the management of the hotel. Staff is busy, welcoming, yet discrete. My room, bathed in light, was always impeccable.

Check is was a breeze as we were welcomed with traditional leis and our bags were brought up by the concierge. My initial impression of the room was a bit disappointing - it was much smaller than anticipated and did not have the lanai I was sure I booked. (But the view!!). I called and asked to upgrade to a larger room, none where available until 3 days into our 9 day stay. But, they made the upgrade to a huuuuuuge corner room with a lanai and views of both the ocean and the city (at no extra charge-much to my amazement!). The service from almost everyone we encountered on the property was just exceptional - everyone exhibited the true spirit of aloha. I only had one negative experience at the Deck restaurant: We sat for 15 minutes with no service and left, which turned out to be a great opportunity to grab a burger around the corner at Teddy's Bigger Burger (worth it). This property was quiet, beds are comfortable, had a phenomenal view of Diamond Head, was very clean & accommodating. I do have to mention that the pool is ""inside"" the Deck restaurant, so, if you plan on swimming you WILL have an audience. Valet parking is expensive, park one block away for the weekly rate and walk.

745078449,50,Queen Kapiolani - Top Tier location on Waikiki,"The Queen K is maybe the best kept secret on Waikiki! On far east Waikiki, the hotel offers amazing views of Diamondhead and the ocean, and is a quick one block walk to the beach. Valet-only parking adds about $50/day to the hotel room price if you have a car, but the valet service is top notch. Newly renovated lobby area and restaurant/bar is modern, but exceptionally overpriced food and drink prices may have you walking to other close-by alternatives. For business or leisure travelers who want to explore the entire island, the hotel's location right off Kapahulu Road gives quick access to H1. Overall, I think this property is excellent, with the only real drawback being the price and service of the onsite restaurant options. I've stayed here twice - once in 2018 and again in 2020.

It does not cover parking and you have to pay to leave your bags there (I've never see a hotel charge for this EVER).

743240686,30,"Lots of potential, but needs work.","Cons:  • VIP coordinator needs training on own hotel details as well as ways to effectively solve customer issues.  • Bar and restaurant menus on hotel website vs Deck restaurant website vs actual menus; none match offerings or pricing. Looking at the websites it seems they are streamlining their offerings and raising prices as well.  • Food and beverage is very expensive. Good quality and nice to see such a great bar and cocktail program, but it’s expensive even for Hawaii.  • Bathroom Soaps not Hawaiian as implied, they are actually made in China  • Knots coffee: Great coffee, mitigated by the need for many of their staff to undergo hospitaltaty training. Very expensive too.  • Pool is cold/unheated despite nice sunny location (therefore mostly empty)  • Luggage storage fee, note check is an early 11am. You’d expect that to be included in the “resort fee”.    Pros:  • Great art and design throughout the hotel. The recent renovation was thorough and added some wonderful elements and really adds to a sense of place and reminders of the great days of old Waikiki.  • Great location  • Very good gym; new equipment, nice decor.  • FloWater station program: amazing but underutilized. Should have more communication with guests about brining their own water bottles to refill    This hotel has so much potential, it was sad to see the more than a few small service items fail and recovery for those items fail too. The GM or whoever is in charge needs to get out of his/her office and train and motivate the staff and interact with guests and try to see their experience.

The welcome drink offered was unappealing- we thought we would be able to choose a drink of our choice but received an alcoholic slushy drink which was only 1/4 of a cup. The $5 tokens they provide for breakfast, lunch, dinner are basically unusable.

That said, it was a very short walk to everything with restaurants and shops no more than two minutes away. The beach is an easy five-minute stroll.    We had beautiful sea views and it was awesome to see Diamond Head from Deck, especially after doing the trail during our stay. It was so easy to find the hotel even after a long, long day of flights to get there and valet parking was always quick and easy. Parking in Honolulu can be a bit of a nightmare, so this was a great luxury. We explored the entire island from our base at the Queen Kapiolani and it was easy to get to every corner of Oahu from there.    The lobby area is gorgeous. It's exactly what we hoped for - always beautiful music playing, it's open plan and breezy - and even more lovely than the pictures.

I would certainly stay here again, especially if able to get a special rate. Recognize it is at the easternmost end of Waikiki, ie no more hotels to the east of it, it's the end of the line. That's good in that it means great, uncrowded park area all to one side of the hotel and keeps views from being blocked. On the other hand, it means a longer hike back into the heart of Waikiki. For us that was fine because we don't mind a walk. My biggest problem is with the expense of the hotel's restaurant. When we were there, they left a gift of a $5 credit for breakfast at the hotel. Turns out that was not even enough to buy a cup of coffee. So just don't eat there.

I must admit that their smiles and aloha spirit is exactly what we thought our Hawaii experience would be like. They helped us with our baggage, gave us helpful tips for our vacation and made us feel very welcomed each day.

The lobby itself has lots of charging ports, which helps if you need to do some work outside of your room, or if you want to sit down there and chat with old or new friends. There are plenty of comfortable couches, and some nice rocking chairs that face towards the zoo.    The staff all give the friendly Hawaiian vibe and attitude. It was a pleasure staying with them.    The room itself is spacious, clean and we have an amazing view of Diamond Head and the city skyline. If you close the lighter blinds, at night, the city lights are spectacular. (10/10 view).

Our views of Diamond Head were fantastic. There are many shops and food options to walk to and the beach is nearby. The open restaurant and bar area was so nice.

738513376,50,"This Hotel is Full of ""Aloha""","It is very rare that I come across a hotel with service so genuine as what my wife and I experienced at the Queen Kapiolani this past December.    As a hotel professional myself, (I am an Area Director for a large hotel company), I stay in hotels roughly 70 to 80 nights a year. I can honestly say that I have not had a stay that wowed me or was as memorable for all the right reasons as I experienced at the Queen Kapiolani.    We checked in a little late and the front desk was waiting and ready. The associates at the Front Desk where always available and willing to assist us. Our flight was cancelled at the last minute and we were able to extend our stay with no concerns.    We stayed with you for two weeks and the two housekeepers that worked on our floor were amazing. In fact one day I was under the weather and Eterlina came by to ensure we were ok and if there was anything additional I might need. The first morning we received a note from Ming letting us know that she found $5.00 that my wife had dropped. I was very impressed.    The Bell staff could not have been any better. No request was too small and in fact they greeted us each and every day with a very warm friendly “Aloha”.    The location is amazing. We were a little concerned that the hotel might be a little out of the way, but it is only a five minute walk into the heart of Waikiki.    Overall, after spending 2 weeks at your property, we felt less like guests and more like “Ohana”.",Jan 2020,December 2019,Traveled as a couple,Spend a little more and book a larger room!,Vancouver BC
738131921,20,Poor customer service is a big tuirn off and do not keep promises,I arrived in the morning and could not check in. I asked them to contact me when my room was ready and I told them that even checking in 30 minutes earlier would be appreciated. Noone contacted me and even when I asked 15 minutes before check in if I could check in they said the room was not ready. This occurred even though other people were being allowed to check in earlier. So I was not sure what was happening. They do not care about each individual guest and their needs. They ignore special requests to check in early when booking online - they do not even bother calling you to let you know the status of the room.    I had to wait a long time to get my luggage where it was being stored. Staff were not available for a very long period of time.They seem to want to take the luggage to your room but I would be very careful about giving your luggage to another person to handle . The staff hated feedback about the lack of service at the luggage storage department - they were very rude and did not take the feedback seriously.    No kettle and cups in the room. You have to spend time asking for this. No tea bags.    Log in details for internet given at the check in desk were not correct.    Only 1 small soap available.    The bathtub was terrible - the water disappears while you are sitting in the bath. Does not seem to work.    Instructions to make international calls on the landline phone are not correct.    The bed was comfortable and there was a couch to sit on.    Overall staff do not seem to care and hate feedback.

We tried to change rooms but they didn't have any nor were we able to pay to upgrade. No worries, we made do. No real drawers and no fan in the bathroom. We were on floor 3 - same as restaurant. Thankfully it wasn't too loud.    Location of the hotel is what makes it really great. Although you are not on the beach, you're a block and a half away. The bellmen has beach chairs and beach towels for you to use. Deck next to the pool was also nice, great view of Diamond Head. Even though we were in December, it was never super busy. It's less busy near the hotel and an easy walk to restaurants and shopping.    Loved that we could get Dole whip from Aloha Whip in the lobby. Also loved that there were water filling stations. Would have loved pool service from the Deck restaurant - we have to throw on clothes and shoes to walk to the bar to get drinks/food. We never ate at the Deck restaurant. Would have considered breakfast but their main push is a $30 buffet and they have very limited a la carte items. To be honest, I think they would do better with breakfast with more a la carte items.

I thought room cleaning is done between 1-4 hours of when I reverse to sign to “service needed.” Upon return from my hiking, all sweaty; I called the house keeping line, but no answer (got the busy tone several times). I also called the front desk several times including the manager during my third call, and they informed me that a house cleaning rep. will drop off some towels and take my garbage away. But after 15-30 minutes later, still nothing. Anyways, my complaint is the fact that as a guest, I should have been briefed on the information re: housekeeping such as the time frame that they clean, and/or calling the front desk if I need certain time that my room needs to be cleaned, and etc. Anyway, just disappointed and I suggest for future guests to be briefed on housekeeping info since everyone has different schedule.

Most of the staff are great but I couldn’t get a drink at the pool bar as they kept ignoring me and would serve people who walked up beside me (and I’m well over drinking age!).

733514873,50,Excellent service and rate at the Queen Kapoilani Hotel,"We are kama ainas (locals) and my husband was running in the Honolulu Marathon. We wanted a place to stay that was close to the finish line and affordable. We got more than we expected. The room was lovely, clean and updated. The view of Diamond Head and the ocean was so appreciated, even for just one night.    The DECK restaurant was very busy, but they got us in for an early dinner. The waitress made a mistake on my order. She brought me the incorrect item. The manager was there in no time checking our satisfaction, he took it away and brought want I ordered as soon as possible. The grilled salmon was unbelievable.    Since this was my husband's first marathon we had no idea how long it would take from him to complete the race. Unfortunately, he was going to be done too close for even the late checkout. The bellhop put all our luggage in my car that I had valeted. I have a bad memory but I believe his name was Carl (?). He was a very helpful and polite, Asian gentlemen with salt and pepper hair working on Dec 8th, day shift around 12 noon. He was a real lifesaver!

733451047,40,Would I come back? Probably.,"We were very impressed with the look of the hotel. The lobby is beautiful and the front desk staff were welcoming. We were greeted by Nolli (sorry if I am spelling that wrong) and he was very helpful when we asked about upgrades. We loved our room and the view of Diamond Head. However, we thought we were getting a good deal when I booked the hotel through American Express - it seemed very fair priced and comparable to other hotels in the area. Unfortunately, you are surprised with a daily hospitality fee of $35 and a valet/parking fee of $45 nightly - making the hotel a little more expensive than I anticipated. It would have been nice if American Express disclosed that upfront or if it was just charged to your card when you book with the rest of the fees.    They have a text in your questions/requests option which I thought would be awesome but the staff took sometimes up to an hour to reply - so usually I would just call down or walk down to the lobby instead. They also had an option to scan your valet card so your car would be ready when you got downstairs but when we tried it the valet said “oh it’s off” when we went down... luckily they were fairly quick at getting our vehicle.    Overall, I liked the look of the hotel. Clean and comfortable. The coffee bar and the shops in lobby were great. Their restaurant “The Deck” is wildly overpriced but they have some good Happy Hour and daily specials. The pool is right next to the restaurant which is a little weird.    Would I come back? Probably... but more prepared to pay for the extra fees and I would absolutely not bring a vehicle.",Dec 2019,December 2019,Traveled as a couple,,"Seattle, Washington"

It's eco-friendly with retro decor and modern comforts.  I can't say enough good things about the hotel itself, nor how kind the employees are (Gerald got us ice from the restaurant when the machines were emptied (everyone icing sore legs from the marathon, I'm sure); they let my parents check-in under my reservation since my flight landed 10 hours later.) Last year I picked the city view since it was cheaper. This year we upgraded to the ocean view and never tired of the unobstructed view of Diamond Head and the ocean. It's a block from the start of Waikiki beach so still slightly tucked away from the tourist traffic (said the tourist) yet close enough you can walk just about anywhere.

Currently it’s 10:15 pm and I can hear noise blaring from the bar and people at the pool/restaurant. When I called front desk the response was, “The music should be off shortly.”  Like, what does that mean? So I called again and the manager said it was going until 11? SO glad I spent the extra money to get a nice, noisy room.  Also, upon arrival shower drain was off and the shower head was loose. Seriously?

It is a charming older hotel, remodeled and updated very nicely in 2018. Rooms and common spaces are now modern and well maintained, and the staff are over-the-top friendly and welcoming. My housekeeper, Mata, took great care of me during my stay - she respected my ""do-not-disturb"" sign when it was posted (for several days at a time), and then jumped into action and cleaned and freshened my room quickly when my ""please clean room "" sign was out. The guys running the valet parking desk were also great - I never waited more than a couple of minutes for my car to be brought around. The Front Desk staff are always smiling and offering a sincere ""Aloha!"" at any time of the day or night. The Diamond Head views from ""The Deck"" restaurant and bar and pool area are outstanding. The hotel is in a great location - at the quieter end of Waikiki, but just a short walk to the beach and the rest of the action. Better still, the hotel is literally across the street from the beautiful Queen Kapiolani park which is great for walks or runs before or after work/fun.

728479862,40,4.5 stars. Great place to stay in Honolulu. Very close to the beach.,"4.5 stars    PROS:  -My room had a beautiful view of the beach, which is a short 3 minute walk away  -This hotel is directly across the street from the Honolulu Zoo  -It's also a short walk to multiple ABC stores, two food trucks, a Denny's, and a few fast-casual restaurants. A 7-10 minute walk will lead you to more upscale dining.  -The linens in the bathroom are delightfully coarse. Not sandpaper, but just enough to give you a gentle exfoliation as you wash or dry. Additionally to the complimentary toiletries, the hotel also offers samples of a reef safe sunscreen. It doesn't smell the best, but it will do in a pinch.  -The shower in the room has fantastic water pressure. I was able to rinse off quickly and be on my way.  -There's plenty of open shelving space in the room for you to put your belongings, and still see them. Greatly reduces the risk of leaving something behind.  -The iron in the room is top-notch. Usually hotel irons are kind of iffy in terms of efficiency, but this thing is better than the one I have at home! #NoWrinkles  -The hotel provides two free reusable water bottles for guests to keep and to stay hydrated while on the island.  -There are plenty of outlets in the room  -The room also comes equipped with some kind of plug in flashlight. When not in use it remains plugged into an outlet on the headboard. As soon as it is removed, it emits a very bright white light  -There are also reading lights on either side of the bed  -There are water and ice machines on every other floor.  -The Deck Bar is a great place to unwind at the end of the day. The drinks are pretty good and the bartenders are awesome!  -There's a coffee shop in the lobby which also sells snacks and light bites. There is also a small shop in the lobby that sells Dole whip (pineapple sorbet), ice cream and other snacks.  -Despite what the front desk may tell you, there is a microwave in the hotel (it's in the coffee shop in the lobby)    CONS  -I asked for room on a the highest floor to prevent the noise of people walking overhead. Even though my room ended up being on a middle floor, the staff told me that they would put me in a quiet room. Unfortunately, their idea of a ""quiet room"" is right next to a Groom's Suite, with a steady stream of people entering and exiting the room and talking loudly at 5:30 in the morning. After that, it was generally more quiet (although I could hear maintenance and/or housekeeping servicing neighboring rooms through my walls). Definitely not the ""soundproof"" rooms that they boast on TripAdvisor, but at least there was no overhead noise.  -Wi-Fi strength fluctuates a bit  -Not a fan of the in-room toiletries. The reef safe sunscreen smelled awful. Definitely recommend avoiding that stuff. The Hawaiian Tropic shower gel barely foamed, and I was very glad that I brought my own. The body lotion was not moisturizing at all... Which was pretty surprising. that saltwater can strip the moisture right out of your skin and I really thought that this lotion would be better suited to combat that. Again, glad I brought my own stuff.  -Front desk staff are not as knowledgeable about the hotel as they should be. (see comment in the ""PROS"" section regarding the microwave in the coffee shop)  -The ice machines are a bit inefficient. They have shallow drip trays that need to be emptied regularly, and the ice dispenses oddly. More of it gets in the drip trays then actually gets in the water bottles provided by the hotel. They didn't think that configuration through very well.",Nov 2019,November 2019,,,"Washington DC, District of Columbia"

The location is great, a few blocks from the hussle and bussle of the downtown, and WOW what a view of Le'ahi (Diamond Head) from the pool, restaurant and rooms. They have live music Thursdays through Sundays, Lei Making and Ukelele Workshops, Runnng Club, and Yoga. They pride themselves in sustainability and provide all their guests a re-usable water bottle. In the lobby there is a Surf Shop, Dole Whip Shop (pineapple whip, the best thing I have ever had), a boutique and a coffee shop that turns into a bar at Happy Hour. The rooms are modest and large. You will want to return again and again to this resort.",Nov 2019,November 2019,,,
727990483,50,Stay like royalty,"This is my third trip to Honolulu but first time staying at the Queen Kapiolani. I picked this hotel based on the high rating, location and good pricing. Let's start with all the good. The location of this hotel is wonderful, you pretty much step out of the hotel and you're at the beach (well with a few steps, but its that close!). You're also right in front of the zoo and not too far from the aquarium. I also walked to Diamond Head one day, and it's very easy to get to from this hotel. Knots Coffee and the Aloha Whip are also conveniently located on the main lobby of the hotel, both have great soft serves and ice coffees which I had more than once (The Queens Cappuccino and Tokyo Soft Serve at Knots are to die for). The rooms are very beautiful, I had a studio queen with an ocean view. Each room has multiple USB charging ports so you don't have to worry about getting your electronics charged. I love the Hawaiian Tropics shower gel, shampoo and lotion, I actually wish I could buy these, cause they smelled so nice. The only downside about the room was the air conditioner was super loud and I often had to turn it off just to sleep. I also used the gym a couple times, and for a hotel gym it was pretty good, did the job and was never busy (a huge plus for me). I would definitely stay here again, probably get a room with a balcony next time.",Nov 2019,November 2019,,Have the air conditioner run while you're out so the room is nice and cool when you get back.,"Vancouver, Canada"

725978143,40,Nice refurb,I have learnt not to expect too much from hotels in Waikiki - they are generally not great value compared to other holiday destnations but the Queen Kapiolnai was ok value wise - clean and newly refreshed. Great location away from the crowds and close to the beach. I upgraded my booking to a junior suite but don't think it was worth it particularly as we were given a room on the 7th floor which was noisy as its directly over the restaruant deck.

First, our fire alarm went off in our room at 5am one morning, front desk was not very helpful and just told me “we will call maintenance, go back to your room and wait”. Second, we asked if we could possibly change rooms because we could hear a noise outside in the street all night. Front desk said they “would look into it and call us back” they never called back.    Parking was $45/day required valet, the resort fee was $35/day.    I would give just one star, but the location is actually really good and close to Waikiki.

725458396,40,Recommended!,"We enjoyed a partial ocean view room with a king size bed and balcony. Fresh renovations, friendly staff, covered parking, reasonable room rates, and a beautiful view of Diamond Head, the zoo, and a section of Waikiki Beach made our staycation very enjoyable. The location is at the zoo end of Waikiki which is the less busy end. There was a free evening Sunset at the Beach outdoor concert (we loved hearing Henry Kapono singing from our room) and family movie right across the street from our hotel that weekend. We walked to try the wonderful Morimoto Asia restaurant (7 minutes) and we saw the Hilton Hawaiian Village Friday night fireworks from the beach. The breakfast takeout from the restaurant in the hotel was overpriced but we had some more reasonably priced breakfast takeouts from nearby shops. The bed was very comfortable and the a/c was nice and cold. Next time we want to book the Diamond Head view rooms for a great forward view and hopefully no other rooms blocking the side mountain view. We liked the relative quiet on this side of Waikiki and my husband got to do a little bit of bodysurfing right across the street. I also liked the historical paintings of the Hawaiian monarchs in the gallery on the lower level. Note: There is a $100 hold on the room on your credit card until the final payment is made which you may not be informed of right away like me. The $100 hold is not actually charged if there are no extra fees that need to be covered.(such as room damage).",Nov 2019,October 2019,,,"Aiea, Hawaii"

Other than that housekeeping was very nice. Check in and check out were very quick and easy. We loved the vintage Hawaiian art that was all over the hotel.  They do have a coffee shop which was good, restaurant (not so good), gallery, and stores.  This hotel is valet only. We didn't realize that when making the reservation, and cost for valet was $45 for 24 hours.

724707322,50,Another amazing vacation,"A+ vacation. Staff and accommodations at the Queen Kapiolani hotel once again exceeded expectations. Jocelyn and Theresa in reception were amazingly efficient and friendly. Dustin in housekeeping was so accommodating with my early day schedules, and Jean and Jerlyn kept things neat as a pin (Thanks, Jean, for the “towel art”. How fun was that!). Kawai and Calvin at the bell desk are always on spot to assist with anything, demonstrating just the right balance between professionalism and friendliness. Staff stability is one reason I continue to return.    This is my fourth visit since the last renovation and it is nice to see continual changes and good maintenance. The Deck restaurant is nice but pricey, but you cannot beat the view. Nice ever-changing selections of beverages at the Knots Coffee Roasters. Good service and friendly staff. I know it is a trade off for having the nice coffee shop, but I do miss the in-room coffee. I want to leisurely get up in the morning, sit on the lanai with a cup of coffee and watch a sunrise I cannot get at home - without having to dress and make my way to and from the lobby. I know some suite rooms have coffee makers, but those are not rooms of which I am interested.    Beachy decor and open design makes the small bathroom more than adequate. I am not a fan of wall attached communal soap and shampoo, so the individual Hawaiian Tropic bottles are appreciated. Inclusion of reef friendly sun screen is a big plus (not only for usage but to help educate visitors). Hot water was plentiful on the top floor with good pressure, towels were thick, linens clean.    The fact some of the windows open is a plus, as when the Trade Winds are blowing it is delightfully tropical. I rarely had the ac turned on.    This hotel is across the street from the zoo. It allows for a gorgeous unobstructed view on the Kapahulu side. The zoo animals are a lively happy bunch and you will hear them chattering all day long.    Hawaii is lovely, but busy, and Waikiki is no exception. The Queen Kapiolani is on the far edge of Waikiki. Across from the zoo it offers amazing less obstructed views of the ocean or Diamond Head if you are willing to pay for those rooms. If you are looking for a room that offers more than just a place to sleep, the Queen K Diamond Head and Ocean View rooms may be in order. As I have noted in the past, you get what you pay for here, but the view is quite worth it.

They ONLY have valet parking which cost $40 a day !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They should be ashamed of themselves. We spent over $200 in parking fees for that hotel. The hotel is definitely NOT WORTH $200 in parking fees. Its just an average hotel and there are many other good hotels (Marriott) that surround it. I think this hotel is a bit over priced for its age and amenities. They offer beach view rooms but its actually NOT on the beach. You have a view of the Diamond Head mountain / volcano and you MIGHT see parts of the ocean in the far distance. The ocean is across the street but its not directly across the street.

It was a mix up for one breakfast only which was in no way our fault and I have learnt since on my return there was no mix up in the booking.

I choose a room that the hotel could choose whether I get a Queen or King size bed. I received my room and it had a Queen size bed..........not acceptable. I went to the front desk to see about getting a room that has a King size bed and a upgrade was offered to me at an additional price[$192-$197]. I paid a good price for my flight and hotel[8 nights] and having to pay for a room that I should have received from the beginning was insulting. To add insult to injury, the additional charge of almost $375.00 in ""Resort Fees"" is crazy. Now the ""Resort Fee"" is for things in the hotel that at one time was included in the price[pool, weight room etc], I don't use those things so to be charged extra, pure greed. On my vacation the hotel was important to me up until this trip, I now see why people[smart people] are using Air BnBs.

721318790,40,"Had a great time, loved this hotel!","Came with my son for a long weekend. Arrived early before our room was ready. No problem, stowed our bags with bellman, went to the 3rd floor to the pool and Deck restaurant. Had our first Mai Tai, Kobe sliders and French fries. Everything was tasty! View of Diamondhead was beautiful. There were plenty of empty chairs around the pool, a shaded canopy area if you want that. Towels available (no towel card needed!) and a sunscreen dispenser, which I thought was genius! Only were there about an hour when we got a text that our room was ready. We were on the 7th floor, overlooking the pool. Some oceanview and Diamondhead. Room was smallish but I get the impression most rooms are small on Oahu. No balcony but we didnt mind, we were only in room to sleep. Mini-fridge in room, water bottles included with water filling stations every other floor. I thought that was great so we didnt need to buy bottled water. Hawaiian Tropic toiletries in bathroom, good water pressure and hot water. The safe in the room was big enough to hold my iPad. The Queen is at the Diamondhead end of Waikiki, next to the zoo (dont worry, no noises or smells) and about a block back off of Kalakaua Avenue, the main drag. The plus of that is that it is less congested from all the business of Waikiki and quieter. The negative in that, for some people, is that you would have further to walk to get to the center of Waikiki. It usually took us about 15 minutes or so to walk to the area of the Roysl Hawaiian. It wasnt an issue for us but could be for some people. They also had complimentary beach chairs by the bellman. Dont know how many were available but we had them most of our trip. I believe they also had boogie boards. Towels for beach were also located there.    Staff were helpful and friendly. We booked online directly through the hotel. They had a fall special where we got a discounted rate on the room plus they waived the resort fees, which is huge.

The lobby is beautiful, open air, and a nice place to sit and relax.    I think the location is the best in Waikiki because its across from a lovely park and the beach nearby is not as crowded as in other parts. And it is a block away from the beach - so close.    The views of Diamond head are stunning. The free water bottles were a nice touch.    Finally, I was sick at the start of the trip and had to miss a few days.

At the time the hotel reception did not tell me that this amount was not going to be refundable after checking out, on check out they told me I needed to wait a week but I have waited two weeks and the deposit is still in their hands    Whilst the hotel was nice, the rooms were clean and the location was great, I recommend travellers to check the prices nearby and to always ensure they are extra careful that was advertised to them is actually what is charged    If you are ask for a deposit like I did, get some sort of written confirmation of the timing of the refund.

715839274,40,So much to love,"There really is so much to love about this place. If staying in Waikiki area, you’d be hard pressed to find a better place in this price range. The location is exceptional being right at the beach in a quiet area with a great view of Diamond head, yet still walking distance to the action of Waikiki. The style of the hotel is very modern with open space and cool art work. Note, I would say this hotel is more geared towards couples and young people. The pool and other spaces are not really designed for kids.    The staff was very friendly and we had no issues throughout our stay. Our room was also very comfortable and clean with a design that matches the rest of the property. I’d also make sure if you are staying that you have a meal at The Deck - the mashed potatoes are to die for.    Just a few things that kept me from giving this place 5 stars:  1. We got an ocean view studio room (7th floor). The ocean view is slightly misleading. Yes, you can see the ocean, kind of. But even so, you’ll want to keep your blinds closed most of the time since the room also faces your neighbor’s patios and the pool.  2. There was a LARGE gap between our room door and the floor so that we could hear any noise coming from the hallway and anybody walking past would be able to hear into our room.  3. The room is a bit cramped in areas, but manageable.  4. Some of the renovations were not done properly as some of the fixtures were loose and other obvious mistakes.  5. The water stations on the various floors were often “out of service” meaning there were times we had to try multiple levels of the hotel to find water.    Overall, though, we still REALLY like this hotel and would stay here again if on the island. But we’d try upgrading to a bigger room that doesn’t have someone else’s patio right outside the window.",Oct 2019,September 2019,Traveled as a couple,,"Portland, Oregon"

The hotel did a great job with artwork throughout the hotel to give it a pleasant feel. Once we had settled in, we wanted to upgrade even more to have a room with a view of Diamond Head. They were unfortunately all booked. :(    So, if you have the money, book a room with a view of Diamond Head. It's amazing!    I also loved the location since I kind of hate super touristy locations.

Even while it is at the end there is the same access to all the shops, restaurants and public transportation. It is only a 2 minute walk up the street and across the main road to get to the beach. The hotel provides beach towels and pool towels. We traveled as a couple and I did not really see many children at this hotel. The pool is sufficient but nothing fancy if you are looking for a huge elaborate swimming pool. They have a wonderful fitness center which was very nice. Provided yoga classes unfortunately I could not make the times of the classes. We had a great view of Diamondhead and even walked to DH from the hotel to hike it. It was about 2.5 miles to walk there. I felt very safe as I would go out in the early morning and take a walk. The room itself it not huge but comfortable. Mini frig is provided. No dresser in the room but there is some shelving if you like to take your clothes out of the suitcase. Not a problem for us because we only stayed a few days before moving onto Maui.

Here is why:    Hotel itself: It is not a massive hotel like the others in the area, getting around is super easy and the distance from everything (pools/rooms etc) is super close. The decor of the hotel is very Japanese fusion with some Kiwi touches.    - Dole Whip on site (major yes)  - Coffee shop (knots coffee - decent coffee)  - Amazing Gym (new equipment)  - Elevators that a real quick  - Great pool (with a view)    Distance: The Trolley stop is like 2 minutes walk away, ABC (convenience store) about 30 seconds walk away.  2 minutes walk to the beach and about 10 - 15 minutes walk to main shopping area of Waikiki. It is a much quieter area of Waikiki which is awesome. The beach is much better compared to the main one in Waikiki, really good to get photos of sunsets.    The Food: Was awesome! Cafe styled food like big breakfast, Granola, etc.The Deck also has live music which is great to chill by the pool in the evenings.    The Room itself: Super nice, would probably recommend staying in the Diamond head room and above as the views are great. The ocean view rooms are amazing!    - Beds are great and they have lots of pillows  - Google Chrome Cast for Netflix  - Decent Bathroom  - Nice Balcony    NB: Rooms do not have kettles but this can be requested please ask your travel agent to request this or request at front desk.",Oct 2019,September 2019,,,"Auckland Central, New Zealand"
714542194,50,"Excellent Hotel, Great location & Beach Chairs!","Waikiki Beach is a truly beautiful place. Our first time in Hawaii was fantastic. The view from the pool was something you can ONLY get at the Queen Kapiolani. It was surreal. thes service was great and the people were always helpful. Calvin by the entry way was great and always met us with a smile.  I would not change anything but I do have some tips.    1. I paid $5 for a soda. That is outrageous, perhaps have a discount on beverages (non-Alcoholic) for guests of the hotel by the pool    2. At check in, tell people the size of the room, we had an issue and needed to switch rooms and realized that for the first 4 days we were in a smaller room    3. the FANTASTIC beach chairs seemed to be few and far between.

714337626,30,Felt like an old motel with freshened rooms,"I am normally not a picky traveler and believe in being fair in my reviews. While this hotel has a hip, upscale lobby, the rest of the hotel feels like a tired run down motel, whose rooms have had an update, but you still feel the motel vibe with lower popcorn ceilings and obstructed views from a small window and balcony..land we paid for the supposedly ocean view lanai room! The bathroom was small and the beds rock hard, but they tried to make it better by sending up more pillows. There is also no coffee/tea making area in the room and I had to call down twice to get a kettle and cups and then they forgot to bring it up again until several hours later it finally arrived! The deck is a cute restaurant beside the pool, but the fake grass around the pool made it feel like a motel all over again, not to mention that there is a very large power antenna that sits adjacent to the only comfortable loungers that didn’t make me feel like I was in beautiful Hawaii. The staff was nice though and the location for being close to shopping and the beach was good. I just couldn’t get past the slightly dressed up motel vibe and this being such an old building. If you want a better place to stay then it seems you have to take a second mortgage out to stay at one of the nicer hotels on the main strip.

713739604,30,Nice Accommodation,"The renovations are great and think it is best to talk about the positive and some items that we felt the QF didn't meet the standards expected:-    Pros: This is a lovely part of Waikiki and away from the majority of the hustle and bustle, similar to the other end of Waikiki. Wonderful views and nice clean hotel, fantastic gym and the food at the deck was pretty good. Gerald the person who looked after our room for the whole visit was fantastic, such a wonderful ambassador for the hotel, always had a smile, engaging and friendly (and also did a great job in our room). The lobby staff were also so very friendly and helpful always. The room itself was nice and spacious (although not large) as well.    Cons: We appreciate the openness of the lobby area with fans etc and a Hawaiian theme, however on a very hot day, I think most people expect to walk into a hotel (which is not inexpensive) and have some cool air. The coffee shop on the bottom floor is quite ordinary we thought; the person on reception that we spoke with on arriving was initially very helpful, however when we were advised we had a room on the 7th floor, we queried as we had engaged directly with the hotel by email seeking advice on what rooms are on the high floors and were advised ocean view junior suites were from the 9th floor upwards which is what we booked. Rather than accepting what we advised, we were then asked to produce the emails (which we did) we found this extremely disappointing. The matter was addressed and we were provided a room on the top floor, although we were urged to still take the 7th floor room. We do believe that the hotel is expensive for the nicer rooms, particually if compared to even some of the 5 star resorts. Although we had coffee making facilities in our rooms, unless you are booking the more expensive rooms, there is none, we believe this really is unacceptable.    Although enjoyed our visit and it is a nice hotel, we are not sure we would stay again, with other places that would have better standards for similar $'s..",Sep 2019,September 2019,,,"Brisbane, Australia"

713190321,30,Modern Motel in Waikiki,"Came to stay for a night to celebrate our honeymoon. Since the hotel was not willing to do anything special for us, I requested that a bottle of champagne be delivered to our room. I was told that the bottle would be $25-28. ok, better than nothing. When I tried to surprise my wife with the champagne it was a tiny single serving bottle on the bed with two plastic champagne flutes not on ice and not even big enough to fill both glasses. No card from the hotel to congratulate us. So I’d say the customer service at this hotel/motel got a failing grade. Remember too that there is an exorbitant resort fee. A resort that can’t even provide a special experience for a Newley wed couple with a resort fee? Doesn’t make much sense. I also requested to purchase a room upgrade upon checkin and the front desk person pretended like she didn’t hear me.

The staff all friendly and professional, especially Richard on the front, he has been brilliant and helpful, a manager in the making... location couldn’t be better, a stroll to beach, shops and restaurants/bars.  Suggestion - The pool area is next to the bar which is very convenient but my personal opinion is that the speaker should be taken away as too loud, even with head phones, just background music in bar would be better, not very relaxing lying there with banging music in your 👂🏽 ear...  My biggest disappointment is and I am very easy going and do not complain normally, we leave tomorrow Saturday and have our room until 12pm which is great, but as our flight isn’t until 22.45 we have no facility to shower before leaving on our long trip back to UK, so tomorrow I will have to shower and wash hair in front of guests on the pool side, no courtesy room at all, if want to keep our room until 7.30pm would cost $210 + tax 😮, I understand need rooms cleaned for new guests, but no shower facilities, never known this in any other hotel I have stayed in! And to be honest has spoilt our beach plans for tomorrow, cannot full shower on beach either, chemicals not allowed! So it is going to be a very long day...

709580535,30,Not a bad place to stay,"Its our first time in Hawaii, we have been warn the hotel are very pricey for Waikiki. However, didn't think it was worth close to $300cad a night here after tax and the astronomical resort fee ($38 US a night after tax). With that price I would expect an ocean view or even a diamond head view room, but we got a room just facing the concrete jungle of Waikiki. We did a very small partial view of the ocean because we were on the 18th floor in the corner of the room or the balcony. This hotel is newly renovated but most of the renovation I believe is just superficial, you can definitely still feel the old motel room feel of the room. Even the window and door is not very sound proof, we can hear the street noise with ease. With a 4 star hotel you would expect and coffee & Tea in the room but there was no complimentary coffee nor tea. There wasn't even any cup to use in the room, except for the 2 in the bathroom, after speaking with front desk they did bring up 2 mugs for use to use and a kettle.    Enough with the bad, there were also lots of good to say about this hotel.    Location is just off the busy area of waikiki so its a bit quieter but still a short walk to the action. Its also sitting just next to the beach. We took a sneak peak at the room facing diamond head and the ocean and the view looked amazing, so I don't know how much extra you have to pay for that, but at $300cad probably another $50 a night for the view. I would consider paying the extra for the view if i stay here again. The gym is modern and its 24hrs, we got a few work outs in there. They have free yoga class and also free surfing class to guest, we took advantage of yoga and working out infront of the view of diamond head is quite enjoyable. The bed in the room is very comfortable to sleep in. The best of all about this hotel is probably the people who work there, everyone we encounter were very friendly and helpful.

709211471,40,Weekend trip stay,"We stayed at Queen Kapiolani for two nights (Friday & Saturday night). The hotel was nice with a beautiful lobby and friendly staff. We were on the mezzanine floor so being the weekend of course the noise from the street was loud at night, but not overwhelming, we were so tired we passed out anyway! What was more bothersome than the street noise was the balcony door would consistently rattle or make noise as if someone was bumping it from outside, but it was just the wind. The view from our room was a run down apartment or hostel building so that wasn’t great, but the overall stay was worth it. I would definitely stay here again. FYI be prepared for a $45 night charge for parking if you do have a rental.",Sep 2019,September 2019,Traveled with family,Seal balcony door better.

708959070,40,Great hotel option on the edge of Waikiki,"Above average hotel but doesn’t quite hit the Very Good threshold for me. Most of the Hotel is fresh and remodeled, open concept and cool art everywhere. Rooms are on smaller side which was okay but bathrooms were tiny. Excellent views of Diamond Head, great outdoor restaurant and nice pool (small). Good location close to the beach but also close to some hostels. Walking distance to main strip in Waikiki - also some excellent food options on Monserrat, check them out! Service was the best from our housekeeper (did an amazing job) and from some of the front desk agents. Upon check in, the front desk person barely looked up, I had to ask for a map and didn’t inform me of any of the activities or amenities offered. Not really 4 star hotel treatment if you ask me. The people that worked at the Coffee Shop and small dole whip store seemed to hate their jobs, unpleasant to interact with them when on vacation.",Sep 2019,September 2019,Traveled as a couple,Room is small; but lay out is good.

We had multiple charges to our travel card for things we never ate or ordered fro there restaurants in fact one was charged after we left the country! They have taken over 2000 AUD from their own mistakes and we have to fight for every cent back.

708657726,40,great hotel,"I only gave it 4 stars because very few hotels are actually 5 stars. But this is great little hotel toward the end of the beach next to Diamond Head. It is next to stores and restaurants and across from the beach. The staff is top notch. It is an older hotel that has been remodeled and it is clean and has a really cool setup. The check in is in an open air area and is quite unique. The room I had was 1118. It was perfect. You see diamond head and the ocean. The Deck restaurant was good and Roberto was a great bartender who made great drinks. Not too sweet, great natural ingredients and tasted perfect. The Mai Tai and Pina Colada were great. And Im a scotch a drinker but just had to try the Mai Tai and Pina Colada. The food is expensive at the Deck but its good. $21 for a hamburger and $15 for a hot dog but its convenient when you dont want to leave the hotel. The food in Waikiki is very expensive everywhere so the Deck's prices are reasonable.The location of this hotel is perfect. You are not in the middle of the craziness and crowd of Waikiki but right near it. Its real easy to catch an Uber because you're on an end road. And the price of this hotel cant be beat for Waikiki. I would go back to this hotel. The traffic is so bad on the strip that staying at this hotel will also save you hours of being stuck in traffic.

Other than the fact that it isn’t well marked from the street my experience here was nothing short of wonderful. Recently remodeled the hotel is a cross of Art Deco and classic surf art. It was such an inviting comforting lobby that on several occasions we just lounged in the lobby enjoying the gentle tropical breeze coming through in the afternoons. I had an ocean view room which was very small but comfortable. Used room service and valet on several occasions and all were very hospitable and friendly.

706216372,50,Great location and value!,"My husband and I are so glad that we chose Queen Kapiolani as our HQ for our anniversary trip to Honolulu! We stayed in a premier ocean view room (#1709), which overlooks the ocean and city. At first, we were a little disappointed that our room didn't look onto Diamond Head as pictured on QK's website, but we got the promised, gorgeous panoramic ocean view, so we couldn't really complain.    The bedroom was spacious and efficiently cooled by the quiet AC system, despite being in direct sunlight all day. The bed was also very comfortable. The bathroom was tiny but got the job done, and the bath linens and awesome Hawaiian Tropic toiletries were replenished without our having to ask. If you need towels for the pool, there are plenty available poolside, and if you need ones for the beach, you can grab them from the concierge. Also, if you forget sunscreen and need more than the small sample provided in your room, there's a dispenser by the pool -- that definitely came in handy.    Oh, did I mention the unbeatable location? Before we arrived, we were apprehensive about it being on the edge of Waikiki Beach and a block from the ocean, behind another hotel, but it ended up being awesome. For significantly less than a cramped city view room in Waikiki's 4- and 5-star beachfront hotels, we got a well-appointed, spacious room with sweeping ocean views and impeccable service. The money we saved allowed us to do so much more on this very expensive island -- with Queen Kapiolani, you can truly ""have it all"", even if you're on a budget.    P.S. Do yourself a favor and check out Queen Kapiolani's website (""Packages"" page) for the best deals. We booked with the ""summer special"" which is 15% off the best rate and no hospitality fee (if you've looked at hotels in Honolulu, then you'll know that's a steal.) There were other offers for ""4th night free"" and ""prepay and save"", so definitely compare your savings on all available options before checking out to make the most of your money!",Sep 2019,August 2019,,,"Glendale, California"
706192979,50,Well done renovation. Great activities.,"Ended up at the Queen Kap due to Air BNB cancellation. Planned to stay near Kapiolani Park so this seemed to be a good substitute. First and foremost the Staff is amazing. Top to bottom. I felt like a treasured guest not someone who booked last minute on Priceline and lucked out getting this property. The valet was helpful with directions, the waiter, Alden, at the cafe on the 3rd floor had great suggestions. I have been coming to Hawaii for years and as far as the Waikiki corridor is concerned I have never been treated so well. Take advantage of the awesome yoga in the am on the lanai overlooking Diamond Head. It is the most beautiful setting to start your day with 8 am yoga. Offered T/TH and Sunday. Meet up with running club in the lobby at 6:00 or 6:30 on TH night for an awesome run workout in the park. Cannot say enough about this renovated facility. My only suggestion is to not get the room I had which ends in 21 as it is small, not bad if you are alone, but is next to the elevator, and has no balcony.....",Sep 2019,August 2019,Traveled solo,,"Las Vegas, Nevada"

705732214,50,Very nicely done renovation of a lovely hotel on Waikiki.,"This hotel was lovely, and has been recently renovated. They have a nice esthetic with a lot of 50s and 60s vintage replication posters of surfers and a mezzanine level with some great paintings of Hawaiian royalty offering us from the mainland a bit of interesting island history (facts generally unknown to most Americans and very interesting). Here on this side of the beach you can experience the island life with really warmth.  The hotel is on the side of Waikiki that is closer to Diamond Head and a bit less overcome by all the shops and malls that you find all over this beautiful beach town. Prices here were good, but the service people working here were all pretty excellent. Main highlights were the bell men, Kawai and Calvin who are not only guarding your property, but who can offer you great advice about where to go and what to see on the island. The warmth and enthusiasm here was really welcome. These guys get bombarded with plenty of questions, and requests and they keep the Aloha Spirit alive in each of their interactions. I would come back here just to keep getting their great ideas about what to do, what to see and where to eat (aside from the lovely restaurant on the 3rd floor).

Daily bed making seems also good.  - Our room was mountain view delux. As expected, we had that nice view.  - The Deck - open cafe with swimming pool - we enjoyed this. They serve nice meal and great cocktails. My little daughter liked to swim in the pool. We love the view of Diamond Head from the sofa.  - The iced cafe latte served in the Knots Coffee was excellent.    (Negative)  - The wooden door to the balcony caused the noise hit by the wind.

705188104,40,Great Waikiki Option,"I selected this hotel due to its high Trip Advisor rating, location and because it had recently undergone a refurbishment. Also, it was a bit cheaper than other similarly ranked hotels.    I found the hotel had a nice ambiance and the team members were friendly and helpful. The hotel had a ""new"" feel due to the refurbishment and the lobby areas were bright and relaxed. The room I had was spacious, well appointed, clean and comfortable. The pool is small but the pool deck was a pleasant place to while away an afternoon. Service in the restaurant was a bit slow even when not busy but the team there were again pleasant and friendly. The hotel is not one of those huge resorts so I did not feel it was too crowded or busy.    One thing I do struggle with is the resort fee that gets charged (not just by this hotel).

Rooms, however, had really thin walls. After two hours of unbearably loud German electronica, I reported our neighbor to the front desk. They immediately dealt with the loud guest, much to my surprise and relief.    -room had a kitchenette, microwave, fridge, sink, and dishes. For the business traveller or someone looking to save a few dollars by preparing their own meals, an awesome amenity.    - view from room was breathtaking. I actually looked forward to going back to our room for the two nights we stayed in Oahu. The staff was welcoming and helpful. And there were several on-site restaurants that seemed to cater to both young single travelers and families. A pool also offers fun for kids and adults, and didn't seem overrun by either group.    - lovely and expansive cafe in hotel lobby offers coffee, tea, snacks, and alcoholic beverages. Staff was obliging and professional and super friendly. Open air seating and comfy chairs, but be mindful of the Poultry Posse. They seem to leave calling cards everywhere...    - Plenty of seating if you just want to chill out before exploring. Gotta hit those ABC's too. If you walk by one, not to worry.

702352044,50,"Clean, Convenient and Great View","My wife and I stayed three nights at the Queen Kapiolani and thoroughly enjoyed it. The hotel has been through a recent renovation and the public spaces are airy and fresh (check out the art gallery on the second floor, and the view from the outdoor terrace of the bar on the third floor. The hotel has a number of different room categories, so we chose a more economical studio that wasn't huge but still plenty big enough for two of us, and we had a lovely ocean view. It's a couple of blocks back from Waikiki beach, which cuts back on some of the noise but the local is still highly convenient. Being next to the park/zoo, you have great views towards Diamond Head and also don't feel crowded in among Waikiki's other high-rises. The ground-floor coffee shop also sells beer/wine/basic cocktails if you fancy a quiet drink when the third floor bar is a bit too hoppin'. We had minimal need to interact with the hotel staff, but those we did were professional and friendly. The price point was definitely mid-range, but check their website for specials on direct bookings.

Unfortunate, because the penthouse floor is shorter than this floor, their balcony, looks directly onto the ""private"" lanai. PLEASE SEE PHOTOS. The view to the left, of Diamondhead, and the view straight ahead, of the ocean, is spectacular....best in all of Waikiki.

Even the view from the bedroom window, peers into the adjacent wing's rooms.    The staff is welcoming and genuine, full of ALOHA spirit.    The fitness room is great, equipped with a rack of dumbbells (to 50lbs), kettle ball weights, and medicine balls. There is room for yoga and several stationary aerobic machines...more than enough gear to get a good ""vacation"" workout.    Parking is valet ONLY.

It has big beautiful windows and a balcony, which we used regularly. The beach is a block away, as is the whole Waikiki shopping strip. That wasn’t our favorite part, as it’s similar feeling to walking down the Vegas strip, with people trying to shove all kinds of samples and brochures in your hands. However, I felt the location of this hotel was perfect - you turn right and there is the beach, food & shopping....you turn left and it’s just parks and beach. The hotel is also right across the street from the Honolulu Zoo.

Sunsets from the restaurant were second to none and my favorite part of the trip. Room as lovely. I would warn though when booking the standard room these can be really tiny and we found the first room we checked into was looking right into other peoples balcony and was advised this is were most of the standard rooms are located. Luckily we did get moved to another room which was much more spacious for our week. Maybe if you want bigger room just book the balcony room :) Staff great - hotel was OCEAN friendly which I loved seeing as the rest of waikiki was still serving food with plastic forks and straws.

The hotel is stellar and pristine, just within the hotel itself there is SO much to do, like hanging out in the lobby on the comfortable seats, having a pineapple smoothie or eating food from any of the nearby places to eat. Prices for room service or eating at the hotel restaurant were a little high for my liking, but you do get excellent food quality. Entire staff was so helpful and friendly, we had a minor issue with our hotel safe and someone was there within minutes to fix it. The hotel location is incredible...five minutes walking to the beach, the Honolulu Zoo is right ACROSS THE STREET, and there are a ton of shops and restaurants nearby. At any point you could leave the hotel and find something to eat or do within minutues. Location is what I loved the most! The staff was also extremely knowledgeable and made us feel safe and secure with their recommendation and tips....if you want to venture all around Hawaii, they definitely will help you with that.

At night, back in the room we discovered that the air con was defective and blocked at 70 degrees F. Suddenly, same room at 9th floor was available. Note that all the time Bellman and Valet were very effective. On the second day, at 08:20 AM, room's cleaning decided to knock at our room. Despite our ""SLEEPING !"", the man insisted.

694552725,50,Gorgeous Hotel,"Aloha people -    Being that it’s my last night here in Waikiki, it’s fitting to write up my review about my stay at QK.    I chose this hotel, because of the amazing recommendations via here and through a good friend of mine who stayed here last year.    I was not disappointed.    There is a special reason why I’m here in Waikiki (again after several times holidaying in Hawaii) my mum has pancreatic cancer and her wish was to come here one last time.    Mum was not disappointed- she and I absolutely loved our stay here. Previous visits to Waikiki, we have stayed at 5 star hotels but because I was on a budget this time, QK fit the bill fabulously.    The decor throughout the hotel - to the key cards to our rooms are beautiful- absolutely stunning.    Our studio room was surprisingly spacious - some people have reviewed it saying it’s tiny, I disagree.  It’s enough space for one or two people. The room is light and airy, we freaking loved it.    Mum was pleased that they had a built in seat in the shower and made it easy for her to use as in other hotels we stayed in, it was always so difficult to use.    The cleanliness of the rooms were of high standard.  Special shout out to Gilda C. and Gerald for the amazing job on cleaning our rooms everyday. You guys are brilliant ! it was always nice to come to a freshly clean room after a long day out.    The GYM - I used it everyday - what a brilliant gym.  State of the art - made my work outs every morning a great one ☝🏽    Also another shout to Kavai, what a lovely human.  Always so warm with that friendly smile. Thank you so much for just being you. Don’t ever change, mate !    I use to work in the hospitality industry and I know it’s hard work - I get it.    But the staff of QK you got your game on right.

It's always been in an excellent location at the far end of Waikiki next to the Honolulu Zoo and a 5-minute walk to the beach. Upon arrival we were obliged to check in early into an upgraded room with a balcony and view of the park, Diamond Head and the ocean. The rooms have been recently renovated and are modern and clean. The hotel lobby is a pleasant place to hang out, have a snack (or Dole Whip!), and even work or eat lunch at the large high-top tables. On Cinco de Mayo there was a booming party down at the pool, making our afternoon siesta nearly impossible, but the hotel noticed this event and made sure it shut down on time, at 6 p.m., so non-partying hotel guests were not annoyed for too long. Pool towels are available at concierge. For a cheap (but good) breakfast, head down the alley (Lemon) and find Waikiki Beachside Kitchen, or saunter over to the newly refurbished Denny's on the other side of the hotel.

He went above and beyond to meet our needs--bringing extra blankets, doing our dishes, providing enough toiletries and coffee pods for all of us, etc. The beds were insanely comfortable; the pull out couch was one of the worst in the world. The espresso pod machine was great, as were the refrigerator and microwave. I wish we also had a cooktop. The service in the hotel's restaurant, Deck, was consistently slow and disappointing--although the food was good. The cafe / coffee shop / bar on the first floor met many of our needs. My kids loved the hotel pool. The entire hotel had a great vibe--colorful and breezy, relaxed yet fancy. The front desk staff was sort of reserved--not rude but not exactly friendly either.

First the rooms should have coffee makers. I read the suites do have a Nespresso machine. The rooms should too. Second if you give guests postcards then offer stamps for sale at your hotel. Lastly give the staff at the Deck better training and support. We are there once and the lunch was completely messed up.

The staff was awesome and very receptive to helping you out. We loved the water bottles that were provided in your rooms to use. This hotel may not be as ""flashy: as some in Waikiki or Honolulu but it was recently updated and if you come to Hawaii and worry about your room then you need to think about why your visiting here.

689346090,50,Absolutely stunning! Home away from home.,"We stayed at the Queen Kapiolani for 7 nights and it was everything and more we could have wished for.  The hotel foyer was so incredibly inviting, styled like a large open plan, retro inspired luxury beach house.  The pool side was reminiscent of a mid-century modern Palm Springs home you would find featured in design magazines. The fluffy green astro turf that defined the pool area had a clever cooling effect with replica white retro patio sun loungers offering full sun + shade options. It was a family friendly pool that had a great feel.  The lounge, bar and restaurant dining area also overlooks the same incredible view. This location is sublime. It feels uninterrupted. You can breathe here.  The restaurant decor is a modern retro, beach house fit out. Cabanas, break out lounge areas with fire pits and a fabulous long bar.  Our hotel room was a sparkling, meticulously curated space with open wardrobe and shelves to store bulky suitcases with featured artworks of the bygone surfing era created by local artists. It felt like home.  The hotel staff were incredible.  Honestly we could not think of a better place to stay in Waikiki.  Congratulations QK on a truly enchanting renovation.

The location is away from the ridiculous riff-raff of the “strip” but close enough to walk anywhere on it.

688792534,50,Great Place near beach,"The Queen Kapiolani was a great stay. The first room we got was a little small for 2 people, but they moved us to another one with a king bed and more space. Free water bottle containers and there are water/ice stations on most of the floors. Beach view was amazing. Wall unit A/C but it's very powerful, but pretty loud. We thought this was a good thing though bcs the rooms felt like they were meant to use more of outside air - the windows open up and you can smell the fresh ocean.  Easy walk to the beach. The buildings and places around the hotel aren't the most posh but they are solid. The area reminds me of parts of Venice beach as compared to Santa Monica beach.  The bar is amazing with really strong, but delicious, drinks. The restaurant was good, with a big open view of Diamondhead. The breakfast was a little basic for my vacation tastes, kind of like a rev'd up McDonald's breakfast with good meat. The lunch and dinner food is much more fancy and delicious. We had the same server, Jennie, a couple times and she was super nice and helpful.  The front-desk and bell staff were great people and very helpful.

687978163,40,Comfortable Stay with Family of 4,"My wife and 2 boys (11 & 8) stayed at the Queen Kapiolani Hotel for 5 nights. Overall, we were pleased with the accommodations. There are many pluses to staying at this hotel and some negatives. First of all, it's right next to the Honolulu Zoo (literally across the street), 10 minute walk to the Aquarium, 8 minute Uber Drive to the Diamond Head Hiking Trail, and a 5 minute walk to the Waikiki Beach. The Hotel itself has a nice cafe, an average eatery on the 2nd or 3rd floor. There is an ice maker on floors 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 which is a first world inconvenience. The hotel appears to have been recently renovated. The balcony with the partial Ocean view was well...partial. The hotel has wifi and the staff were overall very helpful. I wasn't entirely satisfied with the Concierge. From my experience, the Concierge services at hotels is a hit and miss depending on the individual helping you. Waikiki has a million places to eat. We went to Marukami, the Udon place, Eggs N' Things for breakfast/brunch, which was a 45 minute wait. For Eggs N' Things, it's a small place. Pancakes are great, but that's about it. If you want an inexpensive tour, take the Blue Line. It picks you up right in front of Duke's famous statue at Waikiki Beach. Explore the various lines (Blue, Yellow, eta al.) to get around if you are cost-conscious. Otherwise, there are plenty of tours.    We took a tour that included the Dove Plantation, mini-Coffee Plantation, Kayaking, and the hike to a water fall. The main highlights are the Kayaking and the hike. The Dove and Coffee Plantations were super rushed. If you have any questions, please email me. thanks.",Jul 2019,June 2019,Traveled with family,"We were in room 711.

686419440,50,"Flexible, professional and awesome view","We ended up staying two nights instead of one as our flight was cancelled after we had arrived at the airport at 4:30 in the morning. By 7 we knew we couldn't get another flight and we headed back to the hotel. Not only did they give us the very same room we had checked out of IMMEDIATELY so we could get some sleep, but they even lowered the rate for the second night. That's above and beyond in service. They also have a terrific coffee spot in the hotel that I loved and frequented and a gorgeous deck with a view of Diamondhead. This hotel is right across from the zoo which is a great place to see and one block from the main strip with restaurants, Waikiki Beach and anything else you can think of. My one issue was that our room looked down on the deck and a Saturday night party with very loud music was happening until 10 PM. That's a reasonable time, I was just tired and the noise carried. Given the area, that's to be expected. On the other night we stayed, they had one guitarist who played and sang. I had a drink and watched her play and she was excellent.",Jul 2019,June 2019,Traveled with family,,

686236722,30,Will do for a basic place to stay.,"We booked a Premier Ocean View room at the Queen Kapiolani in order to be near our son who was booked into the hotel with his high school band. Although we knew the Queen K was an older hotel, she had recently undergone a major upgrade and was being rated as a 4-star hotel. Upon arrival, we were greeted by friendly staff in a open-air that lobby has been decorated with a clean, light, mid-century Hawaiian vibe that was instantly welcoming.    Our week long stay at the the Queen Kapiolani had pros and cons as listed below:    Pros-  *Great staff, housekeeping, and maintenance.  *Aloha Whip in the lobby- amazing!  *Cool decor  *Proximity to the beach, Honolulu Zoo, Waikiki Aquarium, Leonard's Bakery, Zippy's, and local bus lines.  *Cool pool deck.    Cons-  *Lack of ventilation in the hallways- hot (and sometimes smelly) in the afternoon/evenings. Trapped food odors were a frequent problem.  *Lack of storage for clothing. The only storage for folded clothing was an open shelving unit, so all of your underclothing was on full display.  *Tiny lanai.  *No ventilation or fans in the bathrooms.There is, however, a transom window.  *Located at the far end of the strip away from most of the dining/shopping venues.  *The Deck restaurant was hit or miss with food quality and overpriced.    Our week at the Queen Kapiolani was, honestly, a mixed bag. As you can see, the hotel had pluses and minuses, but in the end, I have a very hard time seeing the hotel rated as 4-star. A solid 3-star would be a better assessment of the hotel.",Jul 2019,June 2019,Traveled with family,,
686236459,10,Not Recommend,"Very old and dated property, looks to have been last decorated around 1970. Some work was happending during the stay, with certain areas closed or very loud. Distrubing guests, and no notice provided to guests before stay. The management seemed to think it was OK for guests, and made no accomodation to alert guests, reduce room prices during construction, or place guests in other hotels. Perhaps resolved by now, but I would not return to hotel becuase of lack of care for guests and lack of notice or options to guest. I should add guests awake to sounds of loud zoo animals across the street. Lowest rating I have provided of all hotels.

The location is perfect, just a 2 minute walk to the beach. To the right you can swim at The Waikiki Wall and left gets you surfing & such.

The hotel itself is very beautiful, very clean and the employees are humanistic. They did not only care for me as a costumer but they cared for me as a family member. My well being was a great concern for every staff member I met. They did not only give me directions to resources; they walked with me and showed you where I needed to be. They did not just clean my room they cleaned my room to my liking. They didn't just say I was their cousin, they put meaning into the word Ohana! I am bad with names, but I will like to thank some cousins, My cousin at the the tourism desk, who made reservations for my tours around the Island, My cousin at the check-in-desk, who checked my in earlier the day I arrived because she saw how tired I was and decided that having to wait another hour or two will be difficult. A shout to cousin Lem, who will check in with me every chance he gets to see if I was okay and that I was having the best time of my life at any given moment. Aloha to my favorite cousin. Cousin Edmund is very profession. He made sure that my room was super clean everyday. He always had a smile on and always happy to help. Cousin Valerie at the Deck restaurant was very sweet and patient. She gives her honest opinion on all the food items so I knew exactly what to order .

684849936,50,Nightmare Trip Great Hotel,"After staying a week in Waikiki, it started off with United losing 2 of our 3 bags. Right when we checked in. The hotel was nice and said they would help us out as much as they could. The next day, they told us 2 of the bags had arrived. Only one of the bags was the right one. Richard, on of the valet parking attendants, heard us on the phone and said he would personally handle it because he knew the courier that did the bags. Within 30 minutes we had the right bag delivered.    On Day 5 of our vacation, my daughter, wife and I had our bags stolen off the beach. In my bag was my GoPro with my bucket list shark cage dive video, wallet with my money, credit cards, and I.D. my daughters bag with her expensive camera which had photo's of my other daughter engagement and vacation photos, iPhone, etc. The suspects also got the key to my rental Jeep and stole that as well. About 45 minutes later, the police found my rental crashed and the suspect gone. You can't make this up. LOL    Noli at the hotel sent us out a cab. When we got back to the hotel we were devestated. My wife and daughter were crying and heartbroken. Ken saw this and dropped our valet and resort charges to help us out. Jocelyn who was a sweetheart, gave us hugs and treated us like a family member. She later called us to come down from our room and gave us Leis made from shells and a bag containing cookies, candy, coffee, and other treats and said if we needed anything else to let her know.    This was hands down, the best hotel we have ever stayed at. These people that work her treated us with class, love, and showed us that people are really good.

Queen Kapiolani has a fabulous team of people working for them. There were a few standouts, Paul in the restaurant, Greg on the tours desk, Mata in house keeping and the fellow with grey hair who helped with storing our luggage( he worked like two people) he was brilliant.  The hotel is in a good location opposite beach and the zoo and just far enough away from the noise. It is in walking distance to most restaurants along the beach front.  The Hotel was renovated about a year ago and they have managed to keep the charm and it was very clean.  My only complaint is the fact that the air-conditioning unit is in the room and way too noisy to have on during the night.  Our room was quite small but fine for one night.

I booked the Premier Ocean View room and had an amazing view of the Diamond Head and the beach. The view is breathtaking if you leave the blinds open and wake up in the morning to pink, violet skies.    Room service is quite impossible if you want food brought to your room. However, it's not too difficult to just get it yourself as the restaurant is conveniently on the 3rd floor. But when you are paying a hotel/resort fee, I do expect a speedy room service.    My room was in the corner of the hotel and was next to a storage room. There are times in the afternoon when I would be awaken by a loud noise numerous times from this storage room.    Concierge is the most helpful if you are looking for a quick tour or excursions. These local guides will take the time to help you and make it easier for you to decide where to go or what to do.

679557832,30,Mixed Feelings,"We stayed in five hotels during our three week stay on the islands and this was the hotel I was most looking forward to staying at. The location, view of diamond head, ocean, pool below, listening to music from the bar area on the lanai several nights was wonderful. We found the room small to all the others we had stayed in, but manageable. We did not care for the shelves they had as there are no dressers. We kept most everything in our suitcase because of that.    The air conditioner blew cold air straight out at the bed closest to the window in this two queen bed room. Until the evening cooled outside and the air went off, you had to cover your head to stay warm. We kept the room at 74 degrees but it felt a lot colder. Also, if the air conditioner was on, you couldn't sit at the banquette by the window - even with a sweater on - just too cold.    Ice and water on the floor was great, as was the elevator - we never had to wait. We liked the security feature of it too.    The staff at the front desk were just okay. Often not even a smile and this was at the start of our stay. Directions given to popular sites was wrong twice, so we just googled the info. instead.    We did have issues during our 7 nights here. We never could dial out locally from the phone in our room. I always had to get the hotel operator to do it for me. On the fourth day a gentleman at the front desk finally offered to have someone come in a fix it. On the seventh day it still wasn't working.    We noticed our room was not really being cleaned and took note one morning that two men were doing the cleaning. We complained about numerous things not done and the next day a lady came in to clean and did a great job. She was off for a couple of days and again the men cleaned and it was poorly done. I had some VIM wipes and did the bathroom myself.    We never went to the third floor to eat or swim. The food choice was too gourmet for our tastes.    So overall we would not stay again. Poor service/cleaning, small room, and the air conditioning being the main reasons. Good location for town buses and being right next to Denny's where you can get a reasonably priced breakfast is a bonus.",Jun 2019,May 2019,Traveled with friends,The higher up the better ocean view you will have.

Also the Honolulu Zoo was literally across the street from the hotel and we loved hearing the monkeys in the morning! The location of the hotel was great, close to everything in Waikiki, we rented a car and there was a parking fee per night.

678690441,40,"Such a great hotel, but service, not so great.","We were so excited to stay here and we were not disappointed when we arrived! Check in was lovely and the girl at the counter accommodated our request to upgrade to an ocean view room at a fairly good price. She was helpful and sweet. That was the the service ended. The hotel itself is great. The renovations in the hotel were amazing and the decor, pool area and rooms felt fresh and new. The gym was amazing! We loved the location as it is at the far end the strip next to the zoo and park, but close enough to town to just stroll in and go to the restaurants and strip shopping. The food and drinks in the hotel restaurant was great, but unfortunately the service in the restaurant and pool area was quite poor. Which tarnished an otherwise perfect holiday. We would love to come back here, and I dare say we will. Im just hoping management will train their staff better. They were nice enough but had no idea what was going on most of the time. And you had to literally beg to get service for a drink around the pool. which was probably a good thing for our wallets, not so much for the hotel turnover. Beautiful hotel, but please train your staff :)",Jun 2019,May 2019,Traveled with family,Make sure you ask the front desk to inform you if your room backs on to the lifts as it can be...,"Sunshine Coast, Australia"
678669645,50,Our Kind of Place,"On arrival it may feel the whole of Waikiki revolves around surfing and surf memorabilia. And Queen Kapiolani Hotel is no exception. One of the earlier hotels, memorabilia makes up much of the recently renovated hotel's theme. The hotel has a laid back feel, unlike many better known brands. But it also comes with the benefits, such as state of the art gym equipment and free Wifi. Its location is also unassuming while at the same time a short walk to beaches, not just Waikiki but others such as local favourite Sans Souci (loosely translated as without worries), and with great views of Diamond Head. Did I mention happy hour? You don't have to venture outside the hotel for regular evening happy hours, usually followed with live music, or you can venture outside for a varied selection of bars and restaurants. We stayed here because Hilton was fully booked due to Memorial Day, and we are now planning our return visit next year.",Jun 2019,June 2019,,,"Auckland, New Zealand"

Live music is amazing, and the Deck bar was awesome. We were there for their monthly sunset session with Hawaiian singer-songwriter, Anuhea. We also loved the lobby coffee shop which was very convenient to grab a coffee and some breakfast before heading out for the day.

The decor is really nice, our room was comfortable & clean. Being on the 2nd floor is was a little noisy at times but for the price is was fine. A frosted glass window on the bathroom would be a bonus or the neighbours have a prime view. The bar was nice with great views, it’s in a good location with a very easy 2 minute walk on to the sandy Waikiki beach. We enjoyed it & would stay again & recommend for value.",May 2019,May 2019,Traveled as a couple,,"Sydney, Australia"
677756567,30,Disappointing,"I wanted to like this hotel much more than I did. Unfortunately Queen Kapiolani just did not feel like it was worth almost $300USD a night for what we got. The finishing and items provided in the room were of very low quality. Do not be fooled by the ""total renovation"" the hotel touts - many things were not updated or replaced, they were simply repainted. We stayed in a Premier Ocean View Room for 9 nights.    The Good:  Internet worked well  Fantastic valet service - big shout out the the valet guys, each and every one of them was great  Friendly front desk  Excellent walking location at the end of Waikiki Beach  Reusable water bottles provided in the room  Filtered water refill station in lobby  Elevators work very fast    The Bad:  Awful Beds - felt like cardboard  Awful pillows - very odd small size on a king bed (smaller than even a standard pillow), also quality of the pillows was poor  No coffee or tea in the room - how is this even possible?!  Balcony was only large enough to sit and enjoy a coffee, except no coffee was provided.  The maid storage door was right behind our headboard so every morning around 7am we would wake up to the door constantly opening and shutting.  The bathroom felt outdated and of very low quality, and the toilet felt like it was at the height for a child.  The airconditioning was on a movement censor so at night we would wake up sweating because the airconditioning had turned off.  The hotel was hard to find as the outside signage is almost non-existent and there are no signs directing where to go for valet. After we found it by circling the block twice, it was fine, but this should be made easier for guests arriving by car.    Had the staff not been so friendly (especially valet) and the internet worked so well I would have given this hotel 1* because my husband and I did not have one restful sleep the entire 9 nights we stayed. I would not stay here again, nor would I recommend this hotel unless you were getting the room for very, very cheap e.g. less than $100/nt.",May 2019,May 2019,Traveled as a couple,,"San Francisco, California"

Friendly front desk and bell staff helped out when I wanted to check in early and when I needed a rental car. Not to mention beach towels available for borrowing! Perfect location at the edge of Waikiki; when my local friends came to pick me up or drop me off it was much easier to access than a place enveloped in the one-way maze of streets interior to Waikiki.

The food at the pool deck restaurant was a bit pricey, but it was good and there were tokens for discounts provided in the room. We checked online for a week or so and found a great price.

Our room was lovely, large and clean with an awesome oversized full length mirror, USB ports by the bed on both sides, reusable water bottles so that they were cutting down their plastic usage (we loved this).    Staff were incredibly friendly, reception, bell staff, house keeping, waiters and bar tenders - everyone made us feel right at home.    Great pool area. Small pool but loads of good quality sun beds and right next to the bar and restaurant - you can order food and drinks to your sun bed. The view of Diamond Head is awesome too.    For the price paid, I felt like the Queen K was outstanding value for money - especially when compared to the price of a room at some of the bigger brand name hotels in Waikiki.

676007067,50,Beautiful Vibe,Just had a 7 night stay here with friends. We had an 2 x Ocean View rooms (2 queens in each). We couldn’t get adjoining rooms as only King/Queen can be joined. We were recommended the 11 series rooms on high floors. We got 1811 and 1711 (the two floors below the penthouse floor). Views were amazing of Diamond Head and the ocean. We originally had booked just Diamond Head views but you won’t see the ocean as they are lower floors or at back of hotel (even though website photos show ocean...) The decor is very retro and relaxed. The pool area is small but had a great vibe and wonderful view of Diamond Head. Only fault would be that you see the power lines next to pool but that can’t be helped. Staff all very friendly. Ice machines on every second floor run out of ice early in afternoon (on have a small capacity) but we were able to get more ice from bar near pool.

675740847,20,Very noisy on the 11th floor,"During our trip in May 2019, we were placed in a room on the 11th floor with a partial ocean view. The stay was nice but there were a few things that made our stay a little uncomfortable.  First thing was the water temperature in the shower. I could never get to the right temperature. I was only getting really hot water or really cold water. I know I'm in Hawaii and is warm but I didn't want a cold shower everytime I jump in. I tried turning the dial of both temperature at the same time but it never got to the medium temperature.  The Mattress: The mattress itself was too hard for my body, especially after a long day of hiking or swimming. The mattress was so hard that it didn't contour to my body. I spoke to someone at the front desk about it but he said it was selected to cater to the Japanese tourists.  The noise bothered us the most since the room was the first next to the elevators, about 8-10 ft away. We can hear the beep each time the elevator stopped on our floor, we heard each time someone closes their doors in our corridor and people talking while walking pass the room. We noticed a gap at the bottom of the door that it can clearly be seen which I'm assuming how the noise gets through.  Although we had these issues, we never asked for a different room because we liked the view very much, but view isn't what we rest our bodies on at night while recovering from our daytime activities.",May 2019,May 2019,Traveled as a couple,Nice pool deck with a restaurant,

672563448,40,Cute hotel for a good price,"There are some really great things about this hotel. The location is very nice, but it is away from the hustle of central Waikiki. For some this may be a downside, but I felt like it was quieter and I enjoyed seeing green space when I left the hotel (it's across from the park).    I stayed here on a prime deal through Agoda and had no difficulties checking in. We were originally in a one bed room and were moved to a two bed, which ended up being great because they claim to be queen beds but feel a bit smaller to me...    The recent renovation is nice but it does feel like a superficial overhaul. There are still dingy corners, cracking bathroom tile, and temperamental hot/cold tub controls. However, for the price, it's excellent. The beds have quality sheets and pillows on them, I love the huge full length mirrors in each room, the AC works wonderfully, the balconies are a great perk, and each room has a mini-fridge (such an underrated amenity!). Another reviewer complained that the roller blinds weren't blackout, but there is a blackout blind and another privacy shade. With both of them down the room was super dark, great for conquering jet lag.    I also loved the surf shop downstairs with $85 surf lessons. We weren't in town long enough to take advantage of that but it's a great price and when we walked in the staff was super friendly.",May 2019,April 2019,Traveled as a couple,"If you're willing to pay extra for a view, do it.

672562754,50,Wonderful Property amazing views!,This was a wonderful little place to stay in Honolulu just off of Waikiki beach. This is a smaller beautiful boutique hotel and not a giant corporate hotel campus. We chose to upgrade to a Diamond head room and it was totally worth it. We got a corner room on the 16th floor and we had an amazing view with a balcony where we watched the Sunrise and Sunset. The location of the hotel is perfect at the very end of Waikiki right next to the zoo and the beach. The beds were comfortable and clean and the service was great. When we first arrived some outlets weren't working but it was quickly corrected and housekeeping was always done timely and tidy. The pool is smaller but that's ok with the beach so close. The Deck restaurant is adequate but a little overpriced.,May 2019,May 2019,Traveled as a couple,"Amazing view, good and quiet location","Muncie, Indiana, United States"
672391197,50,A 1960's Retro Gem!,"I loved staying at this hotel. The hotel underwent a complete makeover last year and has a very cool, hip, 60's beach theme! Our room was fabulous, being on a corner, and had large picture windows looking out over the cityscape and partly over Diamond Head. I imagine the rooms facing Diamond Head would have awesome views! The room was large, with a comfortable lounge area and a really good kingsize bed. I loved the decor...each room is individually decorated...really cute! The location is also great. Being down the Diamond Head end of Waikiki,makes it so much more enjoyable for swimming. It's only a ten minute walk along the beachside to the centre of the action. We thought it was a bonus being slightly out of the centre, as it's not so noisy. The buses which run to Ala Moana and Pearl Harbour are right next door, so very convenient. We had a really lovely dinner at The Deck restaurant and the coffee shop on the ground floor serves the best coffee in Oahu!! Finally, the staff were delightful and very helpful. It was a pleasure to stay here and we will definitely return!",May 2019,May 2019,Traveled as a couple,,"Greater Sydney, Australia"
672365057,30,Mixed Stay,"The good:  The rooms are nicely refurbished & comfortable.  Comfy Bed  Great Views of Diamond Head  Coffee Downstairs is excellent    The Bad:  The doors to the rooms are very loud when closing and with people leaving early or getting in late at night, you are constantly woken up.  Small amount of closet space.  The 3rd Floor pool bar / restaurant is owned separately from the hotel. One day we had access to the pool only due to a function and had to go down to the ground floor if we wanted drinks/food.  Not particularly friendly staff and they are definitely on Hawaiian time!    The Ugly:  The location. We knew when we booked the hotel was not in the middle of town, but that 10 min walk each way a few times a day, particularly in wet swimmers really got to us in the end. We stayed for 8 nights and would look to stay somewhere closer to Dukes next time, If you are only staying a couple of nights, the distance probably wouldn't be an issue. there are many backpacker places near by and although its not unsafe, we felt we needed to be on out toes when waking around the hotel.",May 2019,May 2019,Traveled as a couple,,"Brisbane, Australia"
672325359,40,A Great Find,"Pros  The location was great, not far from beach and avoids the crowds of Waikiki Beach. The view from the bed of Diamond Head was amazing. The hotel is clean, staff are friendly and most tours leave from hotels very close by (within a five minute walk). Beautifully renovated hotel with lots of potential. Expedia representatives on-site to assist with booking tours. Complimentary water bottles provided for all excursions. Denny's just one block from hotel.    Cons  Only things to watch out for are no tea or coffee maker in the room. If you want to have a coffee or tea in the early morning or late at night, there is no option in the hotel. The bathroom is a bit on the small side, especially with regards to finding a space to put shampoo, conditioner and body wash.    Overall Experience  Excellent service however, I did request if they could do anything special (even just a Hope you have a Happy Birthday during the stay) for my husband's birthday via email and however nothing was done. I had to ask then was told that they could not do anything.

There was a refrigerator in the room, but no microwave or coffee maker. I would have really liked these amenities. I would recommend against eating at the hotel's restaurant, Deck.

671928085,50,Great staff,"First word of advice is there is not an obvious sign on the building so you may find yourself wondering if this is the right place, it is. I think the one thing that sticks out to me that the staff was very attentive during our 2 night stay. Our room was a city view that was clean, well maintained and really enjoyed during this last leg of our trip. Staff was really helpful in recommending places to go and food to eat. We really enjoyed the pool and the views by the restaurant of diamond head state park. The water was a little difficult to control in the shower but we figured out how to balance the hot and cold water as there was a small delay when the hot water would engage. There is one hostel that tends to get a little rowdy on the city side but if you can drown it out with the fan, you'll be okay. The beds were comfortable, but would say that the pillows were too puffy. We did find that the red pillows on the couch were great if you don't like sleeping with your chin on your chest. The hotel still gets a 5/5 as there were not any undermining qualities. It is worthy to note it is within walking distance to Waikiki beach, Starbucks, and the zoo. Beach towels are by the valet.

The ground level along with reception has a complete coffee shop with professional baristas that serve lovely coffee along with snacks and refreshments. It also has an ice cream station/shop. Next to the ice cream shop there is an art gallery and then beside that there is a surf shop/school that offer surf hire/lessons and clothing. This hotel is situated at the end of the Waikiki main strip which is fabulous. Across the road you see Diamond head which is breath taking. The Honolulu Zoo is directly across the road from the hotel which is literally a 2 minute walk. You also have the Aquarian here and Kapiolani Park/gardens which is stunning.The beach is here too and it was not over crowded which was comfortable.The hotel on level 3 has a restaurant with seating and beside that is the pool. We had lunch and dinner at THE DECK and food was excellent and well-priced for hotel establishments.Another plus was just behind the hotel (4 min walk) was a bus stop for the Waikiki Trolley so it was ideal to catch.

The staff here had been so kind and accommodating the entire stay. Once I got my keycard, I made my way up to the 19th floor and once I walked into my room, my jaw dropped. The view had me in awe. The bathroom was spacious and clean, the shower was roomy, and the rainfall shower head left me feeling so clean and refreshed. The staff at Deck were so nice and welcoming. I didn't use the pool, but their poolside lounge chairs were very comfortable to lay on. Despite being further away from the heart of Waikiki, I was so much happier when I began my stay here.

No iron, so bring one if you need it. Air conditioner right over bed, so air blows directly down on you, probably would have been best put somewhere away from the bed. And lastly, when I arrived the lady at the counter said I was getting a “free upgrade”, it wasn’t an upgrade it was the same room I originally booked. They’ve just change the name of it to a junior suite in the last couple months. I suppose for the ability to charge more. But believe me it’s no suite, it’s a standard king room with balcony. I’ve stayed in a suite before and this is not one. So don’t let the name fool you. You get standard rooms like this all the time in 3 star and up hotels. Those are my only call outs.

I have loved this hotel for many years. I have seen this hotel go through many renovations, and I am pleased to see it to continually improve. This is my second visit since the latest round of renovations.    The latest renovation has provided a casual, laid-back style with a touch of elegance and quiet nod to the past. The gallery of historical paintings pays respect to the glorious past of Hawaii.    The lobby area shops provides a number of relaxing options from pineapple whips to coffees, bites to eat, art, etc. The lobby itself is spacious with a true beachy feel; murals, decor, furnishings, island music, very laid back, and just begging you to come sit for awhile to enjoy that Aloha whip.    The location is next to none! It is convenient to the beach, the bus line, restaurants, east Waikiki activities, the Honolulu zoo and Aquarium. It is an easy walk to the busier, noisier end of Waikiki.    The beds are comfy, the linens nice, the towels thick. Housekeeping is very good - special shout outs to Dustin and Teo who miraculously arranged to have my room cleaned daily around my very early morning schedule.    Reception is always nice and friendly, attentive to any needs, easy check in and check out. Jocelyn has gone out of her way to help make my stays incredible. Kawai always provides a smile and such a positive attitude; seeing him in the morning just starts your day out with a smile. Seeing the same staff members from trip to trip is one of the reasons I return to the Queen Kapiolani.    As with any hotel, especially Hawaii, you get what you pay for.

The spacious open air lobby was quite comfortable with ample space to relax and take in the various small businesses stationed on the hotel's first floor (coffee, frozen treats, artsy gifts). We were quickly checked in and took one of the elevators to our room. During our stay, one of the elevators was out of service meaning we sometimes had to wait a bit longer to get up and down, but the views of Diamondhead and the Ocean from our 12th floor room were fantastic. We also really enjoyed the spacious lanai, choosing to pick up some provisions and enjoy breakfasts listening to the sounds of the animals walking up in Honolulu Zoo (directly across the street).    Beyond the superbly clean room, friendly staff, and efficient check-in process, it was the little things that made our stay incredible enjoyable. The highly walkable block-and-a-half to get to two different beaches, the water bottles in the room, the filtered water available in the lobby and on our floor, an aggressively pleasant deck with ample opportunity for both sun and shade, and a nice little pool to cool off in.    The other great thing is access to the Waikiki shopping without being in the midst of all the people. Plenty of great restaurants within walking distance, and several accessible bike share racks make it easy to take a bike ride around Diamondhead or to basically anywhere you need.

We absolutely loved the pool area with amazing Diamond Head views, the restaurant/bar area was awesome with great food. The hotel is very cute with lots of fun art and a vintage hawaii feel. The Green room gallery is awesome and the coffee shop is good. The things we felt were lacking was the service in all aspects of the hotel. The highlight was the check-in agent was nice and was able to get us a room earlier than our check-in time which we really appreciated. After that the service went flat. The servers at the restaurant and pool were very slow, but friendly. I suspect they were understaffed. They have a water machine in the lobby but no cups and when we were on our way out of the hotel and very thirsty we asked for a cup and they did not have any just told us we have water bottles in our room, which is great but not when you are on your way out to a fancy wedding, I am not going to haul my water bottle around with me. It would be great if they also had cups at least behind the desk for such situations. I am all about being eco-friendly which this hotel is working really hard at, but there is also the service and comfort you would expect in a nice hotel that needs to be maintained. They had a bartender working the coffee shop in the evening who proclaimed he never works there and doesn't know what he is doing and he was right about that. He had to make my double espresso three times, once because he threw it away as I was paying! The rooms were cute and clean but quite small, it was very crowded with the 4 of us. We were in 407 and it was very noisy at 5:30 AM with the dumpster being emptied each morning, the rooms are not soundproofed and it sounded like the truck was in our room I would for sure stay here again but upgrade our room to a larger one, away from the alley.

668483898,50,Premier Ocean View king Room,"Just returned from an 8 night stay at Queen Kapiolani Hotel, our third visit, but first since the Hotel renovations and our first time in a Premium Ocean View king Room, RM1410.    The renovations of the common areas are superb and fitting for the hotel and its era, all the hotel employees were wonderful, friendly and helpful, and special requests gladly accommodated. The room was a real treat and the view of the ocean, Diamond Head and Kapiolani Park were spectacular.    We have always preferred the location of this hotel as its at the end of Waikiki and off the main strip allowing the guest to choose between quieter times or walking down the street to the more commercial area of Waikiki.    A couple of things for the hotel to work on for our next visit.....1. a full length mirror in this particular room layout is definitely needed and could easily be installed adjacent the clothes hanging area. 2.Coffee and tea making facilities should be standard in these rooms. 3.Considering the Hospitality fee, the hotel would do well to invest in more Beach chairs, which are advertised on the Hotel website, but are few and far between and in poor repair. We were advised that guests do not always return the chairs daily as requested, but this could be improved by actually keeping log of who takes what and when, and if that fails, to charge a daily refundable deposit.    Overall a great stay at this hotel and we will definitely choose Queen Kapiolani Hotel again when visiting Oahu.

The elevator bank was directly behind the wall of the room, and the elevator noise was disturbing throughout the night. Although there was a tiny balcony, it was unusable due to the hot exhaust of an air conditioner from the adjacent room. Also, I was disappointed that the pool was much smaller than it looked from the photos on the website. Most of the ice machines were out of order and one elevator was undergoing repair.

The space of the corner unit 717 that it probably was part of a suit that they seperated to add to inventory.  I was traveling with my husband and in order for the second person to get in/out of bed, you would have to jump over the person. You only have enough space to walk to the bathroom. They called this a standard room. I kid you not, it was probably on 95 square feet total.  I had to pay for an upgrade if I wanted another room. I was shown one that was bigger and had a sofabed and king bed. It had a patio with 2 feet x 5 feet in size. The space was good but all the windows/drapes would need to be closed because the building next to it was so close and it gave me a freaky feeling. I refused the upgrade.  The gal that was assisting me offered one with a better view but the upgrade cost would not be worth it since I live in Hawaii.  So I inform the gal that all I want is a bed that I can get in from either side and space to walk comfortably through without getting brosed just to get to the bathroom .

They give you complimentary drink bottles in the room and water stations on every second floor which saved us so much money and saved a whole lot of plastic bottles.  The food on the Deck was superb and the cocktails were great too. Knot Coffee Roasters downstairs make lovely coffee and were decently priced too. Actually the whole hotel - food, rooms, cocktails, etc - were all well priced.  Location wise, it’s a block from the beach and most things are in walking distance or trolley distance. Starbucks is half a block away, lots of food nearby and even a laundromat a short walk away.  We walked pretty much everywhere - we only got one Uber to the bottom of Diamond Head but we walked to the top and then walked back to the hotel.

666845302,30,Overall ok,"The lobby and pool deck area have been redone nicely, but the renovation seemed like they didn’t cross all their t’s and dot all their i’s. The staff only door on my floor by my room was all dirty, looks like they didn’t bother to get a new door during the renovation. The room was ok, I had the “hostel” view, right across is a hostel and my window/lanai faced its rooftop deck area, so that meant I had to put the blackout blinds on or everyone could see what I was up to at night. The windows aren’t very insulated so I could hear birds chirping in the morning and also the college age kids playing drinking games during the evening on the hostel deck. The tub drain was dirty already and looked like it had been used well before any renovation, and there was even a crack on the side of the tube. I reported it to front desk so that I wouldn’t get in trouble, they only notated it and said they didn’t need to call engineering, which was fine because I just wanted to make sure I wasn’t going to be responsible at check out. The lanai door was an old door rather than a sliding glass door, so that was weird. I’m sure the higher floors are better, but being on the edge by the zoo just didn't help the experience I had. Very much felt the hotel was on the cusp of a high end hostel, especially given its location at the end of the strip.

Next time I would upgrade to a balcony room on the side that looks at both beach and Diamond Head. The hotel is a T shape so on one side the balcony rooms only look at Diamond Head.  The pool was small but not too busy, so more pleasant than some other places that are packed.  My only complaint is that the air conditioner was really noisy and I couldn’t work out how to turn it off. I would have liked a kettle in the room too and a shower cap but these were little things.

666109340,40,Great newly renovated hotel,"We just spent 6 nights at the Queen Kapiolani. Overall, we had a very pleasant stay. Every person who works there from the front desk, to the bell desk and maid service are very friendly. The location is awesome. We've been to Waikiki at least 10x and each time we stay at a different hotel. We've stayed at the high end brands like the trump, Sheraton Moana, and some other boutique hotels like the Hotel Renew.. The Queen Kapiolani (with the renovation) is a very nostalgic/sleek hotel. I love all the old posters on the walls and the simple design layout. It's next to the zoo, away from the main strip which makes it convenient to get in and out of Waikiki without hitting tourist traffic. We opted out of the expensive $30 valet rate and easily found parking nearby everyday. It's an easy 15-20 min walk to the DFS shopping center (which is on the other end of the strip where all the high end stores are located). TIP: If you are sensitive to noise, request a higher floor room. Ours was on the 18th floor, 1 floor beneath the penthouse floor. Although our room was high up, I could still hear some street noise from below especially on Friday/Saturday nights, the music from the deck was very loud. The hotel is located next to a lot of Hostels so expect random drunken noises from the younger kids.  So here are my pros and cons:  PROS-  1) The little stretch of beach by the hotel is great because it's not crowded and there's a barrier that blocks the waves.  2) Free reef safe sunscreen. We decided to buy sunscreen at the ABC store because the hotel sunscreen smelled a bit funny and it was too thick to put on  3) Free beach chairs, towels and boogie boards (great for beach days)  4) Free pineapple whip samples at the lobby  5) Love Whiskey Wednesdays by the pool & HH at the coffee bar in the lobby. Strong $8 Old Fashioned and $6 mai tais in the lobby  6) Free water bottles for water refills  7) Prompt service: clean rooms everyday. Our window shades were broken and was fixed right away    CONS-  1) Driving in on the first day from Kapahulu, there's no visible signs showing the entrance to the hotel. Turn right on Lemon, and another right up the ramp is where the valet & pickup/drop off is located. And the lobby is on the right  2) Next to hostels so noise is to be expected  3) Deck: cool diamond head view and happy hours but the food service is a bit slow. A group of us went down for drinks one night and sat there for 1 hour without getting any service from the staff. We left empty handed.  4) Rooms and bathroom on the smaller size. Reading the room descriptions, it was expected. Not a big deal if you're going to be out all day",Apr 2019,April 2019,Traveled with family,,los angeles

I'm not sure how *special* that level is, other than we had a corner room with a deck overlooking two directions - some of the hotel district to the side and the ocean.  The room itself was small and the layout quirky. It was equipped with a TV, but that was placed on a narrow shelf, and was only visible at a severe angle from the bed, even turned as much as possible. There was not a single chair in the room; only a small built in seating area smaller than a loveseat.  We thought the hotel's location was great. It's a *very* easy walk to a beach or to a pier with great Waikiki or sunset views. And it's an easy walk down Kalakaua Avenue - we strolled all the way to the Halekulani.  The Deck restaurant gets mixed reviews. The outdoor venue is very pleasant for dining. Breakfast was very good - the coconut chia “pudding” outstanding. Dinner was OK. But a ""margherita"" pizza is *not* a cheese pizza with red sauce and basil. We also ordered two apps, which turned out to be entree sized. Great bargains, but not if you've also ordered entrees that you then can't finish.  Overall, I'll give the hotel a solid 4 stars.

664030068,40,Spectacular views of Diamond Head and the ocean,"Our room had spectacular unobstructed views of Diamond Head and the ocean! You can’t beat the view at this price point. Location was on the quieter end of Waikiki, across from the zoo and within walking distance of several restaurants and only 1 block from the beach. The renovated lobby and 3rd floor restaurant, lounge and pool area are gorgeous and look brand new (but the pool is very small).    I was surprised that after the expensive renovation, the guest rooms have just received a fresh coat of paint and some new hipster/vintage décor. Walls are still thin with old popcorn ceilings, “bath-fitter” shower stall and no bathroom ventilation fan, and the wall-mounted A/C unit means that the temperature can be uneven throughout the room. Bath towels were thin and sandpaper rough. Windows were spotty and needed to be cleaned. Street noise may bother light sleepers, even on higher floors.    Front desk service was inconsistent - we received fantastic service from some employees (Justin Bliss and David Kim) but our initial interactions with front desk staff left us confused and frustrated. The hotel seems to have a strict 3pm check-in time (even if your room is ready), so after a long day of travelling, we sat exhausted in the lobby with all our luggage for over an hour until 3pm. Before our stay, we had called the front desk to make sure that we got the room and view we reserved, but were still given the wrong room at check-in. After we were switched to the correct room type, we were finally able to relax and enjoy ourselves. We especially appreciated the fact that when we left the ""do not disturb"" sign on the door, no one bothered us at all.

Close walking to anywhere and less than 100m from the beach area.  Hotel is in a quieter area near the zoo but wouldn’t walk around too much in some of the back streets at night. Close to the pink line hop on/hop off bus from Waikiki Trolley company to go to the main eating strips.  Great service from everyone and the coffee is fabulous, which was surprising given that we are not keen on coffee anywhere else in the US (we find it too weak).

We were lucky when we checked in and the hotel had availability so they upgraded our room at no additional cost to us.

The hotel provides two reusable water bottles and has many refillable water stations throughout the hotel.

The pool and restaurant deck is beautiful with unobstructed views of Diamond Head, you forget you are just off the busiest street in Oahu. Service was great from start to finish. Some days we were offered fresh fruit while lounging by the pool which was a nice touch!!    Only complaint was the unpredictable noise at night; we were facing north in a city-view room, and the hostel across the street can get loud at night when their guests are on the roof.

It would alternate hotter and colder every minuteish. They just remodeled and it's pretty nice. The restaurant on the 3rd floor is nice. I had the ahi sandwich which was good but not great. It wasn't as highly priced as I feared it would be. It was pretty moderately priced in the restaurant considering the location. I had an ocean view room that was a complimentary upgrade and it was a very nice view. The staff were super friendly and helpful.

657249858,40,Second Visit,"This was our second visit but the first time seeing the fully renovated hotel. This is a historical hotel that has been renovated from top to bottom. The first and second floors are showpieces. Front entrance has red lights shining on building at night. Both floors have amazing architectural design elements. Beautiful surfboards and artwork in lobby. Well-designed outdoor/indoor seating area in the Knots coffee shop. Got upgraded to a 7th floor room with a stunning view of Diamond Head without asking (thank you)! Bellboy staff were extremely friendly and helpful!! Kudos to the great housekeeping staff also! Coffee at Knots coffee shop was good. Also enjoyed the pineapple slush at the tropical drinks shop (unfortunately guava slush was never available the entire week). Food at the Deck restaurant is good but service is not great (guests waiting to be seated even though restaurant is almost empty). Could do with some privacy screens between restaurant and pool area.    Only major problems encountered were: poor wifi service and noisy A/C unit. Also large sofa in bedroom had very scratchy fabric.    Overall, really like this hotel!! Looking forward to our next stay!

The bedding is nice and the location perfect for going Waikiki or walking to bars and restaurants. The pool and restaurant area are extremely nice and the food there very good -drinks a little pricey but are all hand made with natural ingredients and so tasty. There is pool service menu and drinks as well. We had a nice view of Diamond Head as well as the water.  Thank you for a wonderful stay! We will be back!,Mar 2019,March 2019,Traveled with family,,
657169136,50,Queen Kapiolani Hotel is wonderful!!,"The hotel is located at the end of the Waikiki strip which we liked after a long day of experiencing the hustle and bustle of Waikiki. Still it was close enough to walk to all the restaurants and shopping areas. The beach was only 2 blocks away and the bell staff will give you beach chairs and beach towels. The hotel is open, airy, bright and gives the perfect Hawaiian vibe. Our room had a view of Diamond Head which was lovely. Wish there was more space for my clothes but we made it work. The only noise was from the monkeys at the zoo which was fun. We stayed for a week and enjoyed all the common areas....the Deck with the pool was beautiful & yummy and Knots for coffee each morning was a great way to start the day. The icing on the cake was the terrific staff.

656951224,50,Birthday trip,"We took a chance and booked this hotel since it was newly renovated, I’m a clean freak and really need a cozy clean comfortable place to stay. REALLY. I have my favorite hotels, but budget excluded those choices. I really needed a long 8 night trip to get some much needed sun and rest in my old hometown. I’m so glad I did because the hotel lobby was nostalgic and airy and comfortable, this is important to come “home” to after a long day in and out multiple times. The hotel manager was kind enough to upgrade me after the first room wasn’t good enough for my level of pickiness, you can imagine how relieved I was. My room was CLEAN, comfy, and cozy. Pristine walls and carpet. The city view from the 9th floor is lovely with all the city lights at night.    The negatives is that it’s not in a central location with the fancier shops but I didn’t mind that for this rest and relaxation birthday trip. The area surrounding the hotel is a little run down, and there is a hostel next door with a rooftop tabled gathering area that can get very loud, but you just close the door/window and you can’t hear them to much.    Queens beach is right across Kalākaua ave and it’s got surprisingly good clear snorkeling with plenty of fish. It’s mostly coral, with some sandy patches to wade around in. There’s a Starbucks just a few doors down from the hotel which was a dream come true for me. Two ABC stores somewhat adjacent to the Starbucks, so having that convenience was great since we didn’t want a car rental. There’s a great video on YouTube of the area, search for  “Honolulu Zoo to Waikiki Beach 2/16/2019” .",Mar 2019,March 2019,Traveled as a couple,,"Seattle, Washington"
656700039,40,Good hotel in a good location,"My husband and I recently stayed here last month for 8 days. We loved the location since it was in the less busy area of Waikiki. It's directly across from the zoo which = unobstructed views of diamond head. Absolutely stunning views from the rooms. The rooms itself are pretty small and basic. I suggest you bring closet organizers if you plan on being in Hawaii for a while because the open closet only has a few hangers and there is no iron or ironing board in the room. The room and bathroom are really small. But all rooms include a refrigerator and the suites have a microwave and kitchenette. The rooms also included 2 water bottles which came in handy. But the ice/water dispenser is only located on select floors. Most times the ice machine would run out of ice so we would have to search throughout the hotel on multiple floors to find some. If you can select a room on a floor with an ice/ water dispenser to save yourself the trouble. We did order food at the onsite restaurant. It was OK, but very pricey. The wi-fi constantly went out throughout the day. I had issues with our room and bathroom faucet and management was great about tending to the issues. Staff and management at this hotel are wonderful really makeup for the minor things.",Mar 2019,February 2019,Traveled as a couple,,"Chicago, Illinois"

Everything is clean and bright, the beds are comfy and the gym is really good. Two problems: we reserved a king size bed, we got a room with a queen. When questioned, they said they were sold out and blamed the problem on Hotels.com 'third party' booking.

The rooms couldn’t have been more than 8x10 with the bed pushed against a wall so that one person had to either crawl to the end of the bed to get out or climb over the other person. There was not a closet or any hangers to be had. We requested a room change but they said they were full. We cancelled our last two reserved nights.

655313586,30,Nice Stay In Waikiki,"Stayed here for 3 weeks January 25 - February 15, 2019 in a 2 Queen Bed Diamond head view room.  Staff were very friendly and very nice to deal with. Easy check in and check out.    Good and not so good points. You notice things on a 3 week stay more so than a couple of days.    NOT SO GOOD    1.Beach chairs were not that great.  2.Resort Fee had no value. (None in Waikiki do)  3.Room was very small and bathroom even smaller.  4.Plastic unwrapped, not to be thrown out cups (2) in room were rarely changed unless brought to staff attention.(Hotel should invest in wrapped plastic cups instead of the current unwrapped plastic cups. Mostly every hotel in the world does that.)  5.One bed or the other was changed but not both together. (1 card in bathroom to be  placed on a bed for sheet changing. Maybe card should say change both beds.)  6. Knots Coffee Roasters staff downstairs used different sized cups for Happy Hour  Beer all the time. Some much smaller than others.  (Maybe should use 1 size)  7. Knots Coffee Roasters staff give you a coffee then you have to take it over to a  small counter station with a built in garbage can and put your milk/cream/sugar in  yourself. Once waiting in line for 4:00PM Happy Hour Beer, when my turn came it  was 4:01 PM and staff person said I was too late. I never returned.(Should eliminate  tip jar.)  8. Noisy area.    9. Had breakfast once on the Pool Deck but only once. Ended up going to Denny's just  a two minute walk away most mornings. Much cheaper.    10. First night after long trip we ordered food to our room. This food (Mac & Cheese and Caesar Salad $57.00 USD) was delivered cold with no utensils. We sent it back and went out to eat on our first night.    GOOD POINTS    1. Great Hotel Staff  2. Pool Deck area was nice to just lay around and get a tan and have a drink.  3. Location is very good.",Feb 2019,January 2019,Traveled as a couple,,"North Bay, Canada"

It is opposite the zoo and short 10 minute walk into central Waikiki. Views over the zoo, park and up to Diamond Head were great.  Good for families as well as couples. The casual lounge area in the foyer was great to relax and recharge.  All of the staff were helpful especially housekeeping. Mata was a breath of fresh air.  The only negatives were internet kept dropping in and out but the hotel was aware of it.  The restaurant was also not a good experience. Service was poor. Hopefully just a once off.

(Note--no refrigerator or coffee maker) Upon check-in, the extremely pleasant young man noted our reservation request for a lower level floor (as one of us does not get in elevators). He changed our room from the sixth floor to the second (#205). Unfortunately, while it was great not to have to use the elevator, the room was located quite close to the elevator plus close to the open staircase which led up to the poolside bar, which amplified noise coming from the bar. After two nights of almost no sleep, we asked for a different room. Unfortunately, the same extremely pleasant young man was only able to find a vacancy on the tenth floor (an upgrade, no less), which would just not work for us.

654623963,50,Perfect Stay In Waikiki,"Favorite stay in Hawaii! Our family got two rooms for our stay, a room with two queens and a room with one queen. One room had a view of Diamond Head and the ocean and the other was ocean front. Even though you are staying in Waikiki, I highly recommend getting a room with a view. Sitting in the balcony first thing in the morning enjoying coffee is priceless. You can hear the waves at night. The hotel is newly renovated so everything feels new and fresh. But what made this hotel outstanding is the service from the front desk to the bell service. It felt like everyone was doing their best to answer all questions. I felt so welcome and really enjoyed my stay. It is also very close to Queen's Beach (quieter than the hustle of Waikiki), zoo, and aquarium. It's still walkable to other things like the International Market, Dukes, etc. I would definitely recommend this hotel for couples or families.

654021378,50,So good that I stayed another week!,"10/10. What a wonderful wonderful hotel! I booked for one week and then changed my flights so I could stay another week it was so good.  The hotel has a groovy retro feel and takes you back to another time in Waikiki. The room was spacious and thanks to the lovely housekeeping,everything sparkled and shone as brand new.  It was the most relaxing, energising holiday I have had. I am already planning my next visit there in a couple of months. I selfishly hope the hotel remains a bit of a ‘secret’ for a little while longer.    The hotel anticipated everything I needed and even those I had not thought of! All was smooth and easy All staff were wonderful from Noli who checked me in to the always smiling Anthony at the Deck who would make my day.  However, my biggest extra extra super staff member is Hedwyne in reservations. Because of extending my holiday in a busy week, Hedwyne went way and beyond to make my stay special and stress free. She has said set a new benchmark in customer service.  (With her Front Desk manager David and Reservations Department manager Vanessa!).

653905922,20,Not so great,"My husband & I stayed here for 10 days. Upon arrival/check in, there was some sort of problem with our reservation. Finally found us a room, got there, and found the AC didn't work. A weird set up placement of Tv & bed. Reported A.C. issue, maintenance showed up & was unable to repair. Moved to another room. Both rooms were extraordinarily small. Called front desk to see if our reservation was correct. She said we booked a standard room, & all standard rooms were that size. Figured we're only basically there to sleep & shower, so it would work. No microwave or coffee maker in room, however we bought some instant coffee & they do offer a hot water pot. Beds were pretty hard for my taste & asked for extra pillows which were sent up. Housekeeping could have been better. Altho they made the bed, they never left toiletries or towels, which we had to ask for almost on a daily basis, as well as requesting the room be vacuumed of crumbs we spilled from snacks brought back to the room as well as the bathroom being neglected. The staff were all very friendly & helpful which helped offset the other negativities.

653024468,30,A good renovation with serious downsides,"I wanted to love the new Queen Kap. And there is plenty to like: smart lobby and pool spaces (though not luxurious), great gym, nice location. The view to Diamond Head is first-rate.    But a great hotel is in the details, and here is where the Queen Kap misses. Housekeeping was remarkably poor: no toiletries replaced, no cleaning of toilet, no wipedown of surfaces, no replenishment or cleaning of glasses. Though it had a sublime beach view, my room (1616) was claustrophobic by Waikiki standards, with room for only one beside table and no balcony. Desk staff were stringent to the point of rudeness about check-in and check-out times, as if you were a nuisance for asking for flexibility. Maybe worst of all, wifi was in-and-out throughout the stay, and the in-room entertainment system depends on the wifi.    Note that they now charge a ""hospitality fee"" of $28/night.

652765147,50,"Awesome hotel, great reno, wonderful staff","The Queen Kapiolani Hotel was originally built in 1969 with 19 floors and over 300 rooms. My daughter and I stayed here at the Queen Kapiolani Hotel last November (10-17) soon after their $35 million renovation. Due to their renovation they reopened with rooms half price which was a great. The hotel is located around the corner from the bottom of Kalakaua Avenue, well the main drag through Waikiki, and is a 5 minute walk if that up from Queens Beach, the Waikiki Beach Walls and Kūhiō Beach up Kapahulu Avenue past Starbucks on the corner, Teddy's Bigger Burgers and Hula’s Bar and Lei Stand which are both in the Waikiki Grand Hotel next door. The Honolulu Zoo and Queen Kapiolani Park is directly across the road and they recently opened a Denny's about a block up from the Queen Kapiolani Hotel on the right hand side just before Kūhiō Avenue on the left. Our VIP Trans transfer van dropped us off at the back of the hotel and we were greeted by their friendly valet staff. The reception area and lobby are just stunning, very tastefully done and retro cool. A friendly young man Noli at reception was very helpful and although we arrived at the hotel at around 8am and our room wasn't going to be ready until 3pm we were happy to hang out in the lobby (but ended up having breakfast at Denny's then shopping at Ala Moana Center to kill time). The lobby has a lot to offer, the Knots Coffee Roasters cafe serves excellent coffee and some nice breakfast options with a lovely open seating area at the front of the hotel. There is also an ice cream, iced drinks and the much loved Dole whip soft serve. There is also an art store, a surf store where you can book surf lessons, bathrooms for guests, a Flowater purified water station to fill up your water bottle(s), an ATM, a helpful concierge desk and lots of comfortable seating including these benches which have both USB ports and power outlets underneath. The pool deck is on the third floor is awesome with unobstructed views of Diamond Head, complimentary beach towels, beach chairs and even a sunscreen dispenser by the pool. Note the pool isn't heated which didn't faze us but a lot of people were surprised and found the pool very cold, meh. There's also the hotel restaurant, Deck, on the third floor which serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. We had the acai bowls there for breakfast one morning and they were huge. We managed to get into our room on the 16th floor at 2pm and our room was amazing, very clean and very classy. The two queen beds were very comfortable and although the lanai (balcony) in our city view room was small you have nice views of Waikiki, mainly the surrounding hotels but you could still catch the sunrise and sunset to your left and see the mountains in the distance from the right. The bathroom is small but there are some nice Hawaiian Tropics products, shampoo, conditioner and body lotion, with a good sized bath/shower with great water pressure and plenty of towels. The city view room also has a 49"" LCD LG televisions with premium channels and Staycast. Staycast seemed like a cool idea, like Google Cast but secure to your room only you are able to cast YouTube, Netflix etc from your iPhone, iPad, mobile device but it kept dropping out which was very frustrating. There is plenty of room for your bags, a room safe big enough for a notebook (laptop) and a closet area with shelves for your clothing etc. My only negative points on this room/hotel is that on our first night and a few times afterwards the wifi dropped out sometimes for a few hours which doesn't help when you are trying to video chat with family back home and/or chat, and for some odd reason I noticed that there are two light switches near the room door, one is for some lights but the other is for this lamp on the mini fridge which is plugged into the same power point as the lamp so when you switch this lamp off at the wall you actually turn off the fridge. I realised this when our mini fridge started to smell a bit iffy and our corn chip dip inside the mini fridge was warm. But all in all my daughter and I had a wonderful one week stay at the Queen Kapiolani Hotel, again the staff are very friendly and helpful. I would like to give a shout out to Noli at the reception desk as well as Richard and Kawai at the valet desk. I highly recommend staying at Queen Kapiolani Hotel, great service, rooms and location, plus you could spend hours just chilling out in their beautiful lobby.

The hotel itself is immaculate and the staff are so helpful. Our room overlooks the city but you can also get ocean view or diamondhead views. My only complaint is the Deck (restuarant) and coffee shop are overpriced but that is Honolulu in a nutshell. If ur concerned about price, the deck has happy hour with $5 appies. Try the guacamole. Yum. Overall this place is the best for ur buck you can get in Waikiki. One last thing, if you like quiet mornings, stay away from the 3rd floor.

I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised and very happy with my stay. I love the location at the far end of Waikiki - its easy to walk to the beach, some shopping and even zoo. I like being away from the craziness of Waikiki and like getting out into some of the outer areas to find restaurants, etc. We got a Diamond Head View, Jr. Suite and enjoyed it. We had a mini frig, water bottles, microwave and even some dishes in the room. I was able to make a tea in the morning and keep my snacks/breakfast in frig. We had a great view and plenty of space in the room. My only wish would be to have soft chair in the room - we had two chairs and small table. The room was clean and well equipped.

We arrived in the morning, stored our luggage with the bell desk and checked in at 2pm. The hotel is at the end of the waikiki beach stretch. We like its location, 5-minute walk to beach.

651261814,30,Budget hotel,"We stayed at the QK for 5 nights in Jan 2019. We got the travelzoo grand opening deal and had the premier ocean view room on the 12/F.    What we like:  - view of the room - lovely ocean view and unobstructed diamond Head view  - valet guys - they are super friendly and happy and helpful!  - the shops/cafes  - hotel is close to the quieter part of the beach with some nice shade from the palm trees. Hotel has beach chairs and towels for you to grab as well.    What we didn't like:  1. Room's bathroom.  - The shower curtain smells really bad.  - There is no venting fans but a window. However, ants were coming in from there even when window is closed.  - We think it makes more sense to replace the shower curtain with glass door. Less laundry and we could have a view of the ocean in the shower too.    2. Room itself  - pillows are small  - even though our room had great views, the windows are very dirty  - we had a balcony but the AC unit is also there making it unpleasant to sit on the balcony    3. Hotel's overdoing the eco-friendly theme  - our bath amenities are 3/4 done and they didn't give us new ones and we had to call and ask for them  - water and ice stations are on even floors only. During our stay, the ones on our floor, 10/f, 8/f and 14/f weren't working either.  - the sun screen at the pool stick to your skin so well that we couldn't get it off. Ended up had to get some scrubbing cloth from ABC.    4. Check in  - Check in was ""efficient"". There was no greeting or whatsoever. We handed over our ID and credit card, then a few minutes of silence later, we get our keys and were directed to leave.  - The deal we got included two free coffees at the knots, it wasn't offered and when I was about to ask the lady who checked us in, she left her station already. We never got that coffee.    Overall - average budget friendly hotel at the tail end of Waikiki. It is much cheaper than all other hotels, it's renovated and it's still considered in Waikiki area. But we personally won't stay here again since we would rather pay more to be somewhere closer to Central Waikiki and in a hotel that is a bit nicer.

The room was very nice, clean, and while smaller than I expected, did not feel cramped. (standard queen room). We also had a lovely view to wake up to as our bed faced the expansive windows (the have blackout curtains if you want). We loved the little touches like complimentary sunscreen at the pool and complimentary water bottles and water filling stations. The pool area is gorgeous and the loungers are comfy and plentiful. Ordering a craft cocktail from the bar and sipping on it while taking in the view there is a must.

650193900,50,Very good hotel at a very good price,"If you are looking.for a very good hotel with an exceptional view from many rooms as well as the pool,along with many other good features, this is a good hotel to consider. Coming to Waikiki, in my price range I had the choice of a uhigh end hotel right on the ocean with a fair(not exceptional) view of the ocean or the Queen Kapiolani which is a short walk from the ocean, in a fair neighborhood but which has been beautifully renovated, which has a youthful feeling and has drop dead views both of Diamond Head and the Ocean.    For a reasonable fee, I got an upgraded “junior suite” (Not really a suite)with panoramic views of Diamond Head and the ocean on the 17 th floor. Upon entering the room My wife and I were just amazed at the incredible vistas. For a view monger like myself, I knew I had made the right choice of hotels.  The Bed is comfortable, room is clean, the artwork in the hotel is fun, while the exercise room is pretty first class for a mid range hotel. The pool has a shaded area if you don’t want too much sun (yay!)and the people who work here seem friendly and helpful. So much of the hotel has been upgraded and they did a good job in the renovation.    So a very good hotel for the price as long as you’re not looking for a five star hotel ie the chairs in the room are very simple and not exceptionally comfortable, bathroom is small (but the shower has great water pressure), the place to store your clothes is just a bunch of cubby holes (which actually works quite well) and when it was time to check in, there was a bit of a wait but not horrible, you’re not on the water etc.",Feb 2019,February 2019,Traveled as a couple,,Upstate New York

646615570,30,"Location great, service is a big issue","The two of us travelled from Australia to Waikiki for a 6-night stay. This hotel was one we found through searching the area on TripAdvisor. We booked 6 nights in a suite.    The location is excellent - close enough to Waikiki centre and far enough to have some privacy from the constant noise, construction, etc in Waikiki.    Aside from location, the hotel left a lot to be desired. For quite an expensive room (only one category of room higher above what we had picked), the room is quite unremarkable. Clean and tidy which is nice, but resembles a standard priced overnight-stay type of hotel you would find in any major city for much cheaper and probably better amenities. Small shower with old shower curtain, old bath, water from shower flows onto toilet beside.    Our issue is with the service at this hotel which is a real issue. We experienced great, personable service everywhere we went except the hotel. To echo what people have said, we certainly were not looked after despite the cost of the room.    - we arrived 6hrs early before check in time from an international flight. We had specifically contacted the hotel in advance to advise of this and request an early check-in. Not only could we not check-in this early (which logistically, we understand does happen), the staff provided literally no direction. The entire conversation was “no you cannot check-in now”. We did not get use of wi-fi, pool, shower or any amenities. We explained our situation re the long flight etc, and were met with again, “no you cannot check-in now”. Check in was not available until exactly 3pm despite numerous attempts to confirm if the room was available. Valet staff were very helpful and friendly during this time, and tried to be quite understanding.    - on check-out we asked the night prior how to get to the airport at 0530. They promised a flat fee of $29 for a taxi which would be arranged. On leaving the next morning we paid a $48 one-way trip in a taxi who refused what the hotel had claimed was an arrangement. This was the entirety of our remaining cash in our wallet and was lucky we had enough.    Overall - this hotel is in a good location and the room is clean. Views are nice. It is not a cheap option by any means and provided very little service at all from staff. For a tourist-driven region and a large hotel we honestly cannot understand how this poor level of service is able to exist between multiple members of staff we asked for help.",Jan 2019,January 2019,Traveled as a couple,,

In the process of this wait we misplaced our iphone, and hence lost it. Not a good start to our holiday. Room was clean, but small for a family of 4, and hugely overpriced for the NYE week. Bathrooms are excessively small. We didn't receive welcome drinks as promised, and the tokens provided for the coffee shop downstairs was useless. We also pre-booked for the complimentary hula dance class, and the teacher failed to show with no warning, so we waited in the lobby like dodo-birds for an hour before leaving.

644630258,50,A taste of the boutique hotel experience inspired by Vintage Hawaii,"A last minute and desperate search for hotel accomodation in December led me to the Queen Kapiolani in Waikiki. A visit to the website was alluring, with it's mid century decor, cool beach theme and a recent 34 million dollar renovation of the 1960's hotel. Set at the end of Waikiki beach, overlooking the majestic Diamond Head and within walking distance to the beach it ticked every box. I had my fingers crossed that it would not disappoint.  And disappoint it did not. Exceed expectations... it did! From the moment we arrived we were drawn into the chilled vibe of the Queen Kapiolani with it's brilliant service, open, breezy entrance and vibrant communal spaces. It was evident that this hotel had been recently refreshed but the designers had honoured the spirit of the hotel and the bones and integrity were intact. The facelift included vintage inspired artwork, bold colours, clever use of space, surfboard adornments and tributes to ""The Duke"". We immediately fell in love with the place!  Our room was also in the same vein; vintage, simple but fresh and adequate for our stay and affordable at the busiest and most expensive time of the year.  Over the course of eight days we came to realise that the location is ideal, as it was easy to leave in the hire car, re enter Waikiki in this area - in short a perfect locality to launch yourself from to explore Oahu. However, when the more commercialised areas of Waikiki called us, the designer shops and restaurants were a short stroll down the esplanade.  However, on those nights when you just could not be bothered walking anywhere, after a long day at the beach, the hotel also provided a fabulous restaurant of it's own, with cuisine of the highest standard and wines sourced from the globe to compliment the food and experience. On alternate nights when a drink and snack was required before hitting the pavement, ""The Deck"" delivered music, drinks, snacks with the best of backdrops...Diamond Head at Sunset. What's not to love?  I can thoroughly recommend the Queen Kapiolani to those wanting an intimate Waikiki experience that is reminiscent of Waikiki before the monolithic high rise dominated the skyline. It has a variety of rooms with stunning vistas and beautifully styled rooms which include city views, beach views and views of Diamond Head. All wonderful but reality is that Waikiki and Oahu is such a great holiday destination for all that you wont be spending much time in your hotel room!  We plan to revisit Waikiki with a sense of immediacy and will return to ""The Queen Kapiolani"" to enjoy the service, hotel and the experience.

We had a double queen room and the 4 of us were comfortable if a little tight. Not a huge amount of closet space, but the open shelves were handy. Very good toiletries and comfy pillows. We had a fridge but no in-room coffee. Our A/C worked really well -- not a minor thing in Hawaii any time of year. We never ran out of hot water and the water pressure was really good.

The location is excellent; it's in easy walking distance to the beach, zoo, Ala Wai golf course, restaurants, shopping, etc.    The rooms are bright, clean modern spaces with very comfortable beds. They have great views of the Waikiki Beach and Diamond Head. We were on the fifth floor and had fantastic views from our terrace. My only tiny issue with the room was that it didn't have a coffee maker but there is a great cafe in the lobby that comped my wife coffee when she mentioned the lack of a coffee maker.    The pool deck restaurant/bar on the third floor is awesome. Great place to catch rays, have lunch, watch a game, etc. The food is great; I recommend the poke salad and cheeseburgers. They also have $4 PBRs!    The hotel staff is top notch; everyone who works in the hotel seems to be dedicated to cheerfully helping guests.

They found a way of modernizing while still keeping the sacredness of HAWAIIAN HERITAGE. The rooms are very reasonably priced for the views of DIAMOND HEAD and/or WAIKIKI BEACH. The Hotel is a 5-minute walk to the beach and a15-minute walk to whatever eating and entertainment cravings you may have. The walk you can take along Waikiki Beach is simply amazing. The hotel you stay at can make or break a vacation . The Queen Kapiolani Hotel made our stay such a great pleasure . The pleasure I speak of is because of the hotel staff.

637676978,40,Beautiful renovation!,"Wonderfully redone. This newly renovated hotel had a chic vibe with a beach theme. Located across from the Honolulu Zoo. We occasionally heard monkeys and birds but only a few times during the day. Rooms were clean, comfortable beds, and they make an effort to be green throughout the hotel with double flush toilets, metal straws, and cold water machines. The pool offered free reef friendly sunscreen. We were given a free coffee chip redeemable at Roasters coffee in the lobby. They have a fairly limited menu at Roasters: grab and go wraps and salads and in the afternoon cocktails are available. There is a open air restaurant located on the third floor called The Deck which serves breakfast, lunch and dinner and has an amazing unobstructed Diamond Head view. Freshly squeezed grapefruit and orange juice complimented creative cocktails. I loved the salty sweet grapefruit foam. They even make their own Coca Cola. Waikiki Beach is a short block away. There are several eateries nearby. An outstanding feature is the large portrait gallery featuring portraits of some Hawaiian royalty done by local artists years ago. A few downsides were thin walls and very noisy doors that had a tendency to slam shut and smaller slow elevators.

637068658,10,"Untrustworthy, bad customer service, shady","I live in Honolulu and booked a room for a short staycation but unfortunately I had an incredibly negative experience with the Queen Kapiolani Hotel.    TLDR    1. They overcharged me by $165.  2. They told me early check-in was not available for me (but was for others).  3. They tried to add an undisclosed $60 resort fee to my confirmed room reservation (see photos).  4. Manager Kimberly Gomes was dismissive and unhelpful.  5. Kimberly tried to tell me she was doing me a favor by not charging me an additional $60 for my confirmed reservation.    What happened:    1. The Queen Kapiolani Hotel was listed on Hotels Tonight all week long at $102/night.  2. This morning at 7:30am I checked Hotels Tonight and the hotel was not listed.  3. I checked a different site, Hotels.com and the room was $185.20/night. Despite the increase I thought it would be a nice hotel so I booked it.  4. I arrived at 10am and asked for an early check in but they said it would not be possible.  5. I checked Hotels Tonight again and to my suprise the room was listed again at $102- that price is $165 less than what I had just paid 2.5 hours ago!  6. I called Hotels.com and they said to contact the Queen Kapiolani directly.  7. After much back and forth with the front desk they finally brought manager Kimberly Gomes out.  8. She tried to tell me the room charges should be $429.04 instead of $370.40 despite multiple emails, invoices, and receipts from Hotels.com saying the ""Total to be charged by the hotel"" is $370.40.  9. Kimberly's ""solution"" was to honor the $370.40 price instead of charging me an extra $60 upon arrival.    So, I paid $165 extra for my room because I booked my room 2.5 hours earlier than I should have and then upon arrival was told I've have to pay an ADDITIONAL $60.    *Good customer service would have been to honor the lower price.  *Acceptable customer service would have been giving me a nominal gift certificate or something to make up for the extra $165 they charged me.  *Terrible customer service is trying to sneak in an undisclosed $60 resort fee and then telling me you're doing me a favor by waiving it.",Dec 2018,December 2018,Traveled solo,,"Honolulu, Hawaii"

Starbucks, Dennys, the ABC, etc were all within 2 minutes walking distance as well. The staff remembered us each morning in the lobby (and even the restaurant) so we felt very at home here. The unobstructed view of Diamond Head from our room was just incredible to wake up to and not to mention the fantastic renovations that have been done.. everything looks beautiful. Beds were comfy, a bath and shower, 2 mirrors, a spacious wardrobe area and much more. The food at 'DECK' was delicious and I would highly recommend trying the acai bowl for breakfast or the margarita flat bread for dinner - SO yum. We wish we could come back for more.

I was so disappointed with the view because the ocean was mostly blocked by the next door hotel. Mine was a corner room with big windows running across 2 sides (1 facing the ocean and other facing city). I didn’t feel private at all as our room was facing directly to other hotel rooms. Called & asked to move up a couple floors but was asked to check back next day as they all booked. We tried again next day and got Jeris to help us move to a higher level with unobstructed ocean view and Diamond head. Thanks God my vacation was saved! In short, diamond head view is unobstructed and absolutely beautiful so I highly recommend it for safe. if you want the ocean view, make sure it higher level ( 11th or above)  I still gave it 5 stars thank you to all the hard working and friendly staffs.

My husband and I were looking for a hotel for my father-in-law to spend a couple of days in because we want him to recuperate from a recent surgery in peace and quiet. Knowing that the Queen Kapiolani had just been newly renovated, we called and asked if we could come just to look at the rooms. Their answer? ABSOLUTELY.    The Valet guys were super friendly and even kept our car near the entrance because they knew we weren't actually checking in! :o).    Justin at the front desk was SO. VERY. HELPFUL. First, he allowed us up to the third floor so we could check out the restaurant and pool area, which is GORGEOUS. Then he took us up to view a variety of different rooms... a city view, a Diamond Head view, and a Junior Suite. The renovations are beyond beautiful... each room is spacious and comfy... and completely welcoming! Being able to see these rooms in person rather than just on the website was so much fun! ^.^    Needless to say, we just completed booking my father-in-law's stay and I want to be him!!! LOL!!!

We were on the 15th floor in a city view room with 2 x queen beds - the beds were very comfy, ample wardrobe/storage space for our 8 night stay, partial view of the ocean from the balcony, bathroom was okay. The hotel lobby is nice, open-air and they have a cafe and store with the famous pineapple dole whip, slushies and nuts. All the staff, especially the bell boys were super friendly and helpful, booking transfers and tours for us, storing our bags and providing directions and recommendations. The hotel is in a great spot, within 200-300m to the beach and opposite the zoo and close to DIamond Head. It's a short easy walk up to the main drag with all the shops and restaurants but is nice to be in a quieter area away from the hustle bustle of it all.    Only negative comments were that they hosted the Gay Pride Parade Finale Pool Party private function which meant guests couldn't use the hotel's pool for 5 hours on the weekend and that it was my birthday over my stay and the staff did not take notice and say anything or have a sign or something in my room to say happy birthday.

This hotel is insanely cool, comfortable, hip, in the most prime Waikiki location (to me) and is my new go-to in Honolulu. The whole hotel has an amazingly cool vibe, authentically Hawaii, with the comfort and style of a 5 star hotel. Even the towels and linens are far better than standard hotel issue. The rooms are, of course all new, the pool area is great, the staff is very friendly and very professional. The coffee shop in the lobby is great. The art and pictures on the wall is worth a visit to see how Honolulu has progressed over the years. The view from my room, a junior suite, was full on Diamond Head and Pacific Ocean.

Decided on staying at the Queen Kapiolani hotel based on price, location, and the fact that it’s a newly renovated hotel. We booked a Premier View King Room for a total of 4 nights. Check in process was quick and and easy. We got  up to our room on the 15th floor and the view was unreal! Panoramic views of the ocean and diamond head. The room was spacious modern and designed very well. Based on the photos of what the hotel previously looked like they did an amazing job renovating. Our room had a private balcony which was awesome to just sit and appreciate the view.    The hotel has a nice pool with plenty of seating attached to the Hotel’s restaurant called Deck. Didn’t eat at the restaurant but we grabbed a few drinks there 2 of the nights we stayed.    During our stay housekeeping cleaned our room everyday so every time we came back from a long day out we came back to tidy room which was great. Front desk staff was very friendly as well. One of the biggest highlight of the hotel staff would 100% be the valet and baggage guys. They were our first and last interaction at the hotel and they definitely leave a great lasting impression. Every valet and baggage staff we encountered was super friendly,helpful, and approachable. I loved that we were able to talk them and it just felt very natural, like we were talking to our friends/family. We met a lot of the guys working the bell/valet so I can’t remember all their names except for Warren and Scot but they were all great!    This is our second visit to Oahu, our last stay 2 years ago we stayed at the Aston Waikiki that’s located right in front of us, we Could see it from our room I was definitely not even a quarter as impressed with the Aston as I was with the Queen Kapiolani and at that the Aston we even got an Ocean Front view.

The front desk ladies/men need to learn about customer service-they stare at the computer & don’t make eye contact or even smile. The Bell Hop desk was great-the guys are very helpful-especially Derek. The main bellhop kept me and another group waiting forever 20 minutes as only one guy can give you tickets to keep your luggage? He also didn’t even look at us!

630575393,50,Pleasurable place to stay,"Our trip to Oahu was at the end of September. We stayed the first two days at the Waikiki Beach Marriott Resort & Spa and ended the rest of our trip at the Queen Kapiolani Hotel. We much preferred Queen Kapiolani over the Marriott even though renovation work was still going on at Queen Kapiolani. The room renovations were nicely done (pics included of our ocean view room on the 17th floor). Housekeeping did a great job of replenishing toiletries and cleaning the room. The elevators functioned just fine and included the security feature of requiring a room card to activate. The beach was just a handful of steps away, and the hotel is located at the very end of the main drag. The staff was very hospitable, especially a young valet named Kawai. You can’t help but to love this young man. His personality is one of a kind! We recommend Queen Kapiolani for a pleasurable place to stay.",Nov 2018,September 2018,Traveled as a couple,,
630446564,40,Full refurbished Hotel,"Stayed here End of October. Hotel has been full refurbished. Very clean and modern.  The Advantages : Modern, housekeeping very prompt, rooms nice and bright. Comfy beds, Nice pool area. In fact was nice and quiet most days. Wifi. Great Dole Whip downstairs in lobby. The Floats are to die for. Loved the hotel, but the downside for us was its a bit of a walk to the action. At night time it can be a bit dodgy. Although the homeless are harmless. It just doesn't feel as safe.  The other disadvantage was the pricing and the quality of the food at the restaurant.  My daughter order a coke and fries. The coke was $5 and not a large glass and the fries, well omg they were I believe $5-7 and they were smaller than small fries at McDonalds. Honestly we couldn't believe it. The thing is that night we were going to eat in the restaurant and it put us off. Its such a shame as the bar area and outside ares is wonderful. This was a let down to be honest. If it was more reasonable, im sure we would of ate pool side or in the restaurant for sure.    Overall was happy with hotel and staff.",Nov 2018,November 2018,Traveled with family,,sydney
629958381,50,Amazing newly renovated hotel & friendly staff,"We stayed at the Queen Kapiolani Hotel at the end of October once all the renovations were complete and boy what an experience it was. Where to begin - firstly the staff were just amazing!!!! To drop names, Jocelyn from the front desk was so friendly and helpful. A shuttle we had booked decided not to turn up (Aloha Waikiki shuttle - please do not use) as the driver was too busy yet the booking was confirmed. Jocelyn got on the phone and helped arrange alternative transportation to our destination. It is not often that you get staff going over and beyond the call of duty. We were so appreciative of her help and always found her to be so friendly with a smile on her face. Calvin and Kawai from the bell desk were also just as amazing! So friendly and helpful with anything we required. I don't think I have received such amazing service before with staff who genuinely show an interest to help you out and find out how your day was. Just brilliant!!    With regard to the room, we stayed on the 17th floor in the king room. Loved how clean and cosy the room was - I didn't want to leave. The hotel is decorated so well and everything is clean and tidy. Love the vibrant colors! Also, they have filtered water stations on every alternate level which is so handy. Had breakfast at the Deck and it was delicious!    Some may think the hotel is situated quite far out however this comes as a bonus. It is so peaceful and quiet. Did not have to deal with the loud strikes and busy streets. Not a far walk to the central part of waikiki as well. Close to the bus stops/shops/food places.    Can't wait to stay here again! :)",Oct 2018,October 2018,Traveled with family,,
629757302,40,"Queen Kapiolani, a new fresh spot at the Edge of Waikiki","Just spent a short weekend holiday at the recently renovated Queen Kapiolani hotel. If you have any memories of the old property, leave them behind because it looks nothing like the original. The fresh new ""surf"" motif is great starting with the moving of their Porte Cochere to the back of the hotel off Kapahulu Ave. While having an open feeling the closeness of the valet station to the elevators and the need for a key card to access all floors offers the right amount of security. If you're looking for activity and a workout room that rivals any membership gym this is the spot! the 3rd floor pool deck/bar is also great for and after workout beverage.  Because of it's location we were able to take a nice walk around Kapiolani park and enjoyed the best Friday evening (5:30pm) sunset dinner and entertainment at the Barefoot Café on Queen's Beach. Art Kalahiki and his trio will definitely get you into the right mood for the weekend. Stay till 8pm and it's the perfect spot to watch the fireworks across the water at the Hilton Hawaiian Village.",Oct 2018,October 2018,Traveled as a couple,Jr. Suites have an unobstructed view of Diamond Head!,Honolulu
629756170,50,A Great Holiday!,"Super renovation! Made me feel like I was really in Hawaii. Not generic. Had amazing views of the ocean and Diamond Head. Easy to get to the beach and anywhere else I wanted to go. Didn't really need to leave the hotel to have a good time. The pool with it's view of Diamond Head was fantastic. The restaurant was a good option. Friendly, helpful staff.",Oct 2018,October 2018,Traveled solo,,
629729360,50,Amazing!,"Amazing hotel! They completely renovated the place, and it looks great. I have stayed here in the past, because the location is absolutely perfect, but it did need a renovation. I've got to say, they nailed it with the renovation. The lobby with all of the art, surfboards and aloha shirts is super cool. The new surf shop, art gallery and restaurant in the lobby are great too. Pool and restaurant on the third floor are beautiful, with fantastic views of Diamond Head, the ocean and the park. They put up a lot of old paintings of Hawaiian royalty in this really cool gallery on the second floor, and it looks great. They gym is big and brand new too.    The staff, which are all the same people from pre-renovation, I am happy to see, are all super friendly and helpful. Lots of aloha.    I will definitely be staying here again.",Oct 2018,October 2018,Traveled with family,,"Island of Hawaii, Hawaii"
629188412,50,We Enjoyed Our Stay,"We stayed at the newly renovated Queen Kapiolani for 9 nights and were very satisfied with the accommodations and the superb location of the hotel.

628286639,30,Very Disappointed!,"We have stayed at this location may times in the past...both while we lived in HI and when we visited HI. It is a wonderful location as it is in Waikiki while it is away from the madness that can be Waikiki.    Therefore we were very glad that they have decided to remodel and freshen up the Queen. Besides, the retro airlines to HI posters and vintage Aloha shirts on display were a delight for us.    What was Very Disappointing were the toiletries used in the rooms. In a state such as Hawai'i, where there is a strong movement to ""Make Local and Buy Local""...and for a hotel named for a Hawaiian Queen...the brand used and given out is ""Hawaiian Tropic""...sounds good, but if you look in the back, it is ""Made in China"". Shameful!    The (Newly Renovated) room we were assigned was adequate. We especially liked the two choices of window shades. The sitting arrangement was clumsy and not too comfortable - plus the fabric used, though colorful, may not wear well. The automated answering system did not alert us (the red light didn't work) to pick up a message - causing us to miss a call from a friend.",Oct 2018,October 2018,Traveled as a couple,Higher Floor,"Tucson, Arizona"
