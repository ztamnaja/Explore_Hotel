I would absolutely have given them 5 stars were it not for a slight hiccup on arrival. We had booked (and paid for) 2 family rooms (travelling with friends) in February. However, on arrival there was some overbooking mix-up (still not entirely sure why) and they only had room for one family. We weren't impressed. End result was that we were put in two rooms with two double beds in each for first night; and they moved us to the family rooms for our last two nights. We were given free breakfast next door as compensation.

All that aside, Little Bears is clean, good atmosphere. Has WiFi that works well. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. 

No breakfast at the hotel (but we knew that when we booked) however The Common Room next door offers great breakfast and service. 

Location of Little Bears is also excellent.

There is a popular chicken rice stall and a shop selling organic yogurt just a minute walk away. It is also near to the Women’s Correctional Institution where you can have good and reasonably-priced massage with a good cause.

The hotel is pretty new and neat, with a few big triple, quadruple and family rooms. They provide 4 big bottles of drinking water every day for the quadruple room. Though there is no breakfast, the hotel replenishes complimentary cookies, coffee and tea at the reception area. Sometimes there are also complimentary fruit and crackers at the lobby area. For breakfast, besides frequenting the chicken rice stall (just tens of metres away), we like to dine at the next-door cafe called The Common Room - good service and they have value-for-money delicious set meals and coffee available. 

Lastly, a BIG thumbs-up to Little Bear’s Home service. Prior to the trip, my email enquires were always promptly replied by them. The few staff members we met were very friendly and helpful.

The hotel is brand new and the decoration very cute with teddy bears all over the place.
While I enjoyed the location and the cleaniness of the place, there are a few things that wouldn't let me go back there.
1. The walls are too thin.
We were in the family room with three double beds on the first floor, with the window toward the back. The door was right above the reception area
We could hear eveything and everybody coming and going or waiting in the reception area, even very early in the morning.
2. Our room was dark. A little window for such a big room wasn't enough, so, even during the daytime you have to turn your lights on. 
The artificial lights are very ugly.
3.The girls at the reception are on the phone all the time watching videos and wouldn't even greet us.
4. You cannot walk in the hotel with your shoes on. Consequently you have all the other customers' shoes all over the floor when you get in the hotel.
But this doesn't have anything to do with the hotel, but the other customers politeness. Anyway a 4 star hotel reception doesn't have shoes all over the place.

Arriving at the hotel after a long walk with luggage. The first thing was, please take your shoes off at the door. Approaching the reception the two staff struggled with  English. The first problem arose when I was shown to my room. 8 flights of stairs, no shoes on a very slippery staircase, no lift available. I refused to walk up stairs trying to carry all my luggage.  I had been put on the 4th floor. After unpacking I found the Wifi not working. I looked round the room, no telephone to ask reception about it. So I descended the 8 flights of stairs again to be told you had to pull plugs out and do this and that to the Wifi router to get it to work.The Wifi never worked while staying there. When going downstairs again I was told that the Hotel was locked at 10.00 pm every night, I had to take my room key  to open the door. No one was about at 10.00 pm.  At 01.00am the noise of doors banging, other guests screaming, and running about was not good. Next morning I found out the hotel didn’t have a  restaurant and no kitchen! I had paid for three nights but moved out after the noisy first night. This was annoying having to walk up the street each time I wanted to get to the hotel especially late at night.
Yes the bed was comfortable ( with 4 pillows ) yes the bathroom was new and clean. But I went out at 08.00am that first morning , I told the maids my room was ready for cleaning and I put the sign on. I returned at 04.00pm the room had not been made up!!! They were cleaning rooms on the floor I was on too.",Mar-16,,1

The rooms are well equipped with ac, showers, fridge, microwave and flat screen TV with a digital box. It has everything you need and more and the price is great. 
The bed is super comfortable which is great when you need the sleep but the walls are paper thin which means you will be woken up at 5am from the talking and the school opposite which sings on a microphone until 8am!
The toilets smell of a sewage system which can be off putting for most. 
As it's our honeymoon we needed the peace and quiet and wanted a more authentic place to stay in Thailand so we left after our first night. 
Depends on what you want and like but I wouldn't say this is a bad place to stay it just wasn't for us. 
The location is spot on. Right between the weekend night market which was great for our first night in chaing Mai.",Jan-16,Traveled as a couple,4
